Genomics tools have never been so powerful and accessi-
ble to biologists interested in how the interplay between
ecological and evolutionary forces is shaping biodiversity.
The 2019 Gordon Research Conference on Ecological and
Evolutionary Genomics will explore how the genome-
scale processes that underpin organismal phenotypes
interact with ecological and evolutionary processes over
multiple spatiotemporal scales. The meeting will bepreceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which
will provide opportunities for early career researchers
(students and postdocs) to present their projects and
will include a special mentorship session.
Topics highlighted at the meeting will include: the eco-
logical and evolutionary signicance of novel genes and
variation in genome architecture, including genomic
conicts; the role of hybridization and introgression
as drivers of diversity; genome-scale perspectives on
the role of the microbiome in host adaptations; and
the increasing contribution of genomics to explanations
of ecosystem function. This meeting will also bring
the latest technological developments in genomics and
genome manipulation, emphasizing their application to
non-model species. Join us to participate in creative dis-
cussions in an inclusive social and scientic atmosphere,
to empower the future research in the eld.
Co-chairs, Christian Landry (Universit e Laval) and An-
gela Douglas (Cornell University) along with co-vice
chairs, Camille Berthelot ( Ecole Normale Sup erieure,
Paris) and Sarah Kocher (Princeton University) invite
you to the University of New England on the beautiful
seashore campus of Biddeford in Maine. The meeting
will bring together researchers at all career stages and
working on a wide diversity of organisms. A subset of
the submitted abstracts will be selected for short talk
presentations and a limited number of travel grants will
be available. We are looking forward to your participa-
tion in the conference at Biddeford in 2019!

20th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
#2018YSF
Date: Friday, 23 November 2018, 9:30 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre,
Natural History Museum, London, UK
http://systass.org/young-systematists-forum/ The an-
nual Young Systematists' Forum represents an exciting
setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoctoral re-
searchers to present their data, often for the rst time,
to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy, system-
atics and phylogenetics. This well-established event
provides an important opportunity for budding system-
atists to discuss their research in front of their peers
within a supportive environment. Supervisors and other
established systematists are also encouraged to attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE.
Abstract submission closed on Friday October 26th. We
have a fantastic selection of 16 talks spanning across
the tree of life on phylogenetics, systematic methods,
phylogenomics, time-trees and biogeography. But regis-
tration for non-presenting attendees is still open.
To register send an e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com , supply-
ing:
- Name - Institutional Aliation - Academic stage (e.g.,
Masters, PhD, postdoc, PI) - Gender (optional)
Again the YSF will be held the day after the
Molluscan Forum ( http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-mail
one week in advance. This information will also be dis-played on the Systematics Association website ( http:/-

Okinawa EvolutionSwarmBehav
Nov20-22
We are pleased to announce an upcoming conference:
SWARM 2019: The 3rd International Symposium on
Swarm Behavior and Bio-Inspired Robotics
The meeting will be held Nov 20-22, 2019, at the
Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST,
www.oist.jp), in Okinawa, Japan.
Scope: Evolution by natural selection has engineered
living organisms to have extraordinary abilities. These
abilities are present at the level of the organism, due to
the diverse and inventive biomechanical and control de-
signs that are found in nature. Abilities can also emerge
from the interactions of many organisms; a swarm can
perform many functions that its component individu-
als cannot possibly accomplish alone. For example, in
addition to the ability to adapt to the environment,
a swarm can construct a suitable environment for its
own advantage. The constructive understanding of in-
telligence of living things is a very interesting approach
from the point of view of biology and engineering. Thus,
the natural engineering of evolution provides inspiration
for human engineering, and the reverse engineering of
nature can help us better understand biology.
The aim of this symposium is to foster connections be-
tween biologists and engineers who are interested in
the engineering of living things, from biomechanics to
swarm intelligence, and the perpetuation of a new aca-
demic eld by integrating biology and engineering. In
addition to the main-themes of understanding swarm
behavior and bio-inspired robotics, in the next itera-
tion we also plan to add elements of bioimaging and
functional morphology (creating libraries of biological
engineering to inspire human engineering). Although
this scope is broad, the aim of the symposium is not
to cover these elds comprehensively but rather bring
scientists from dierent elds together to recombine in
interesting ways.December 1, 2018 EvolDir 7
Conrmed Plenary Speakers:
Deborah Gordon (Stanford) Francesco Bullo (UC-Santa
Barbara) Takashi Ikegami (U. of Tokyo) Marco Dorigo
(Universit e Libre de Bruxelles)

tion deadline 12 January 2019
Come to Il Ciocco Tuscany - Italy and hear the lat-
est unpublished research on quantitative genetics and
genomics. The program covers a wide range of topics
and wonderful invited speakers (see the program be-December 1, 2018 EvolDir 9
low). The theme of the 2019 GRC is Use of Big Data
in Quantitative Genetics, and that for the 2019 GRS (2
day seminar for students and postdocs before the main
GRC) is Oered by Big Data in Quantitative Genetics
and Genomics: Methods, Insights and Future Directions,
timely topics for all research in biological sciences in
this data-driven age. The focus of the conference is as
much on the collection and appropriate use of data, as
it is on the mathematical models one can employ on the
data to extract biologically relevant information.
The GRC on Quantitative Genetics and Genomics is
unusual in that it brings together scientists working on
humans, crops, livestock and other species. Gordon con-
ferences are also unusual in that unpublished research
is presented and there is ample time for discussion both
in the sessions and outside of them.
In the two days leading to the GRC, the Gordon Re-
search Seminar (GRS) gives graduate students and post-
docs an opportunity to share their research, interact
with each other, and engage in discussions on career and
life in quantitative genetics in a mentoring session with
senior scientists. Speaker abstracts are due 9 Novem-
ber V all attendees of the GRS will be able to present
their work in oral or poster presentations, please send
in abstracts with your applications!

Doctoral Student position at Doctoral Network in Func-
tional Marine Biodiversity (FunMarBio)
We oer a doctoral position for the period 1.1.2019-
30.6.2021 (max. 30 months), within the Doctoral Net-
work in Functional Marine Biodiversity (FunMarBio)
The main objective with this position is to oer research
education in marine biology and ecology. Understanding
what generates spatial and temporal variation in natu-
ral and sexual selection is one of the major challenges
in current evolutionary ecology. This doctoral project
focuses on how the availability of food and feeding habi-
tats for females aect spatial variation in mating suc-
cess and sexual selection in males in a resource defence
breeding system. The model system is the sand goby,
Pomatoschistus minutus, a small marine sh species
and a well-established model system in evolutionary
behavioural ecology. How female fecundity variation is
reected on mating systems and sexual selection has
received little attention despite that there is a direct link
between female reproductive rate and sexual selection
through the eects on the operational sex ratio.
The project combines trophic ecology with behavioural
ecology. It seeks to explain eco-evolutionary feedback
processes that arise between individual behaviour and
the community and seascape through their inuence on
female fecundity and hence population sustainability.
Information gained through this project will be relevant
in predicting the eects of climate change and device
management strategies to mitigate the eects of this.
The project is part of the recently initiated strategic
multi ^Adisciplinary Proling area The Sea (https://-
www.abo./en/the-sea/) at Sbo Akademi University.
The position is part of the Doctoral Network in Func-
tional Marine Biodiversity and the successful candidate
will be working a diverse and international environment
that provides a stimulating intellectual environment for
research, networking and career development.
We are seeking a highly motivated, self-driven student
who is able to work independently but also in a team.Experience from eldwork in aquatic environments will
be considered as a benet. The current funding is for
30 months, starting no later than March 2019.
For further information about the position and applica-
tion process, please contact Professor Kai Lindstr ~A^A,

Antwerp AdaptationGenomics
PhD position in cichlid sh Evolutionary Genomics in
the Svardal lab at the University of Antwerp
The Svardal lab at the University of Antwerp (Belgium)
has a PhD position available in evolutionary genomics
of Lake Malawi cichlid shes and is looking for talented
and highly motivated candidates to start early 2019
(starting date negotiable).
The 100s of closely related but ecologically diverse
species of Lake Malawi cichlids provide an exceptional
model to study the genomic mechanisms involved rapid
adaptation and diversication. We are working both
on understanding the fundamental processes involved
in the evolution of new species and on understanding
the molecular basis of adaptive phenotypes. Our main
scientic approach is the analysis of large-scale genome
sequencing data using population genetic and statistical
genomic techniques. Recently, we also have established
experimental populations of Lake Malawi cichlid shes
at the University of Antwerp, with the aim to study
physiological and behavioural phenotypes involved in
rapid adaptation to heavy shing.
PhD topics:December 1, 2018 EvolDir 13
- Understanding the role of old genomic variation in
rapid adaptation. We have recently found that Lake
Malawi cichlids harbour genomic regions of exceptionally
high genetic diversity (Svardal et al., in preparation).
In this project you will analyse recently produced whole-
genome sequencing data of 100s of Lake Malawi cichlid
sh species to infer the evolutionary origin of genomic
regions of high genetic diversity. For example, you will
test whether these genetic variants were brought into
the ancestor of Lake Malawi cichlids by hybridisation
with a divergent lineage of cichlid sh and whether this
variation has been maintained by balancing selection. In
a second step, you will use population genetic methods
to test for the role of these genetic variants in ecological
adaptation and speciation of cichlid sh species.
- Uncovering the genomic basis of recent adaptation to
heavy shing through the sequencing of museum speci-
mens. Besides their role as a model system in speciation
research, Lake Malawi cichlids are food for millions of
people, and subject to a recent and strong increase
in shing. Some cichlid populations have seemingly
adapted their life histories to high shing pressure and
mature at substantially smaller size compared to less
heavily shed populations. In this project you will anal-
yse genome sequencing data of the same species from up
to 130-years- old museum collections and from present-
day to compare the genetic composition of populations
at several time points before and during heavy shing.
This will allow us to identify genetic variants, genes,
and molecular pathways selected by shing pressure.
Together with dierential gene expression analysis and
trait mapping in laboratory populations (optionally as
a separate project) this will yield unprecedented insight
into the molecular and phenotypic responses to heavy
shing.
Desired qualications: - Master's degree in Biology,
Mathematics, Computer science, or a related eld - Un-
derstanding of the basic principles of population genetics
and/or strong motivation to develop quantitative skills
in this eld - Some experience with computational data
analysis, statistics, and programming (e.g., R, Python,
command line) and/or strong motivation to acquire the
necessary skills in these elds
We oer: - an attractive doctoral scholarship for 4 years
(contingent on positive evaluation after 1 year) - great
genomic and computational resources and sh facilities
- funds for conference travel and the option to engage
in eld work in Africa - a stimulating, international
working environment

Mexican State of Sonora shares a 375 miles-long border14 EvolDir December 1, 2018
with Arizona, and has a large biodiversity of insect fauna
that remains very poorly known. In the case of beetles in
the weevil superfamily, less than 100 species have been
documented, yet nearly 1,000 species - many of them
new to science - are expected to occur in Sonora. Wee-
vils are economically important; thousands of species
have either detrimental (crop pest) or benecial (bio-
control) ecosystem impacts. This project will create a
new collaboration between researchers and students at
Arizona State University and two Mexican universities,
with the goal of thoroughly sampling the weevil diver-
sity of Sonora and publishing the results in a dynamic
and openly accessible on-line checklist. Longstanding
questions about the evolution of weevil diversity, and
its relationship to their gut-inhabiting bacteria and host
plant diets, will also be addressed. The project will men-
tor two doctoral students and undergraduate students
in the concepts and methods of modern systematics
and biodiversity data science. A multi-faceted educa-
tion and outreach program will include the creation
of a ashcard-based K-3 textbook on regional insect
diversity and functional natural history.
The project includes an extensive eld work and col-
lection curation component, expected to yield at least
5,000 unique species/locality instances of research-ready
specimens in the weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea).
Field-to-data dissemination workows will benet from
further improving the Symbiota software platform, with
new options to publish data packages to external jour-
nals. The checklist will include updated taxonomic
names, all specimens, species distribution maps, host
plant records, images, species prole pages, and an inter-
active identication key to the Sonoran weevil genera as
currently recognized. A well-structured metagenomics
sequencing study of the gut content of more than 100
species in eight targeted weevil lineages will identify
both their plant hosts and bacterial symbiont proles.
This dataset will facilitate the discovery of numerous
symbiont clades, and test novel hypotheses regarding
the relative impact of weevil phylogeny, biogeography,
host associations, and other environmental gradients on
the weevils' observed symbiont proles".
Research in our lab is well balanced between collections-
based and genetic/genomic approaches; with particular
strengths in biodiversity informatics and data science.
The lab is closely integrated with the Hasbrouck Insect
Collection and Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Cen-
ter. We are committed to open science and an inclusive,
equitable, and team-oriented work environment that
promotes the candidate's career and personal advance-
ment.

AuburnU EvoDevo
The Range lab at Auburn University is recruiting gradu-
ate students interested in evolutionary and developmen-
tal biology. Research in the lab focuses on understanding
how a network of three dierent Wnt signaling branches
(Wnt/Beta-catenin, Wnt/JNK, and Wnt/Ca2+) coor-
dinate the regulatory networks that establish territories
along the early anterior-posterior axis, using sea urchin
and hemichordate (acorn worm) embryos as the primary
model systems. Remarkably, functional and expression
studies in many metazoans (vertebrates, urochordates,
hemichordates, echinoderms and cnidarians) suggest
that many aspects of this Wnt signaling network gov-
erning AP axis specication is an ancient mechanism
that existed in the common ancestor of bilaterians and
cnidarians.
We also work closely with the Counterman lab at nearby
Mississippi State University to study how Wnt signal-
ing is involved in buttery wing pattern development.
In collaboration, we have begun to characterize the
Wnt network of signaling governing pigmentary and
structurally-based color patterns.
The position is for a talented PhD student to work on a
NIH funded project beginning in the Fall of 2019. The
student will have the choice to work on any number of
projects in the lab that focus on the roles of Wnt signal-
ing during early AP axis specication and patterning
in sea urchin and hemichordate embryos. The student
will also have opportunities to contribute to our collab-
oration with the Counterman lab. The position oers
training in a combination of molecular manipulations,
high-throughput genome-wide assays and bioinformat-
ics, gene regulatory network analysis as well as classicalembryology.
Auburn University is situated in the quintessential col-
lege town of Auburn, Alabama and is located close to
several major cities (e.g. Atlanta [1.25 hrs] and Birm-
ingham [2 hrs]), the beaches along the Gulf of Mexico
and Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Appalachian Moun-
tains. You can learn more about the Department of
Biological Sciences at Auburn University at http://-

ested applicants should contact Dr. Ryan Range at
range@auburn.edu. With your inquiry, please include a
CV, unocial transcript, and GRE scores if available.
Applications for Fall 2019 are accepted until February
1st, 2019. In-person interviews at Auburn are avail-
able. There will be a graduate student recruitment
week hosted by the Department of Biological Sciences
from January 22nd ' 24th for interested students if they

Salary: 568.5 e/month
Location: the internship will take place at the UMR Bio-
GeCo at the INRA site of Cestas-Pierroton (INRA / Uni-
versity of Bordeaux). The site oers a pleasant setting
within a forest estate located between Bordeaux (20km)
and Arcachon (40km) (see: https://www6.bordeaux-
aquitaine.inra.fr/biogeco/Acces). The research campus
is accessible by public transport from the train station
of Cestas-Gazinet (2 bus shuttles per day).
Background Conifers, the most abundant group of gym-
nosperms, are a unique system for the study of adap-
tive evolution because they represent the largest and
longest living terrestrial organisms, dominate many of
the temperate and boreal forests and are adapted toDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 19
a large variety of environmental conditions (Diaz-Sala
et al. 2013). Evolutionary models of angiosperm kary-
otypes have been proposed recently thanks to compari-
son of available sequenced genomes for several important
species (Salse et al. 2008, 2015; Murat et al. 2010) .
These studies showed that angiosperm genomes have
evolved through frequent, rapid chromosomal rearrange-
ments, including whole-genome duplications (WGDs)
followed by nested chromosome fusions. On the other
hand, conifers have particular genome features that slow
down knowledge on genome evolution. For instance,
conifers have extremely large genomes (ranging from 18
to 35 Gb) characterized by the presence of repetitive
elements (Kovach et al. 2010; Mackay et al. 2012).
These features complicate attempts to sequence the
genomes of this group of plants and the recently re-
leased draft genome sequences are highly fragmented
(Nystedt et al. 2013; Zimin et al. 2014; Warren et al.
2015; Stevens et al. 2016; Neale et al. 2017). One
ancient WGD event is known to have occurred before
the angiosperm'gymnosperm split around 350 Ma (Jiao
et al. 2011). However, whether other WGD events have
occurred during the evolutionary history of conifers is
still a matter of debate between the scientic community.
Nysted et al. (2013) did not nd evidences of recent
WGD in Picea abies and advocated an intense activ-
ity of transposable elements as the main mechanism of
genome size increment in conifers (Stevens et al. 2016).
On the contrary, Li et al. (2015) reported a WGD for
the Pinaceae and another for the Cupressophyte clade.
In addition, most of the genomic studies in conifers have
been performed within the Pinaceae, the largest fam-
ily of conifers, and it has been well demonstrated that
Pinaceae genomes present high levels of interspecic
and intergeneric synteny and macrocollinearity (Kru-
tovsky et al. 2004; Pelgas et al. 2006; Pavy et al.
2012), suggesting a lack of chromosomal rearrangement
within this family. Nevertheless, a comparison between
Pinaceae and Cupressaceae revealed intense chromoso-
mal shuing between both families (de Miguel et al.
2015). Further studies on genome structure, function
and evolution including dierent conifer families are
needed in order to decipher whether evolutionary mech-
anisms identied in angiosperm genome evolution have
also played a key role in the evolution of conifers.
Project The Master2 project will take advantage of
the previous work developed by this team in the con-
struction of a high-density consensus genetic maps for
Pinaceae (updated from de Miguel et al. 2015) and
other published conifer linkage maps (Moriguchi et al.
2016). High density genetic maps are a valuable tool in
the absence of completely assembled genome sequences
for conifers. Combining gene position information (ob-tained from high density genetic maps) with publicly
available transcriptomic and genomic sequences for sev-
eral conifer species (Li et al. 2015) a comparison of
genome structure and function will be performed. The
main objective of this Master project is to study the
genome structure and evolution in conifers. Three main
tasks will be pursued: 1. Genome structure compari-
son between conifer species on the basis of high density
genetic linkage maps. 2. Validate or refute the exis-
tence of recent WGD during the evolution of conifers.
3. Analyze gene-turnover (gain and loss of genes in
particular gene families) during conifer evolution. The
completion of this project will contribute to understand
unique features of conifer genomes that may shed new
light to understand the

I'm looking for grad students who are interested in
addressing evolutionary ecology questions, focusing on
soil ecosystems, starting Fall of 2019. The 5-year, fully
funded positions include a $24k/yr stipend, full tuition
scholarship, health insurance, supplemental travel funds
( $800/yr) and a broad range of academic and recre-
ational benets*.
Dissertation projects will focus on core hypotheses as-
sociated with the McMurdo Dry Valley LTER research
group (http://mcmlter.org), primarily the characteri-
zation of soil ecosystem responses to climate variation.
Our hypotheses are informed by approaches including
community and autecology, ecological genomics, compar-
ative phylogeography, elemental stoichiometry, molecu-
lar evolution, and metagenomics/transcriptomics. Most
(but not all) projects will require conducting eld work
in Antarctica.

ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID1782 Project Description: |
Understanding the role of environmental adaptation is
crucial to develop strategies to mitigate the eects of
climate change. Identifying genomic regions involved in
local environmental adaptation in species of agricultural
interest is among the rst steps towards generating a
plan to conserve the adaptive potential in those species
to guarantee the resilience of agricultural systems in the
future. However, identifying those regions has only be-
come possible in the last decades with the development
of sophisticated genomic and statistical methods. |
This project will sample water bualos in Sabah
(Malaysian Borneo) and the UK, and genotype them
with the Axiom^ a\ ^A 90K Genotyping Array. This ge-
nomic data will be used to characterise the domestica-
tion and demographic history of the water bualo. Addi-
tionally, it will be correlated to environmental variables
from the samples' collection sites to identify genetic
markers involved in local adaptation to Sabah's con-
trasting environments using state of the art landscape
genomic methods. For the UK, correlative analyses
between the genetic markers and production traits of
interest will be carried out to identify genes of agricul-
tural relevance. The combined results of these eorts
will contribute to the generation of recommendations to
inform husbandry practices while providing a collection
of markers to monitor environmental adaptation. |
Supervisory team: |Dr. Pablo Orozco-terWengel
(Cardi University), Prof. Mark Beaumont (Bristol
University), Dr. Benoit Goossens (Cardi University,
Director Cardi University's Danau Girang Field Cen-
tre in Sabah). |This project is supported by Dr. Sen
Nathan (Wildlife Department Sabah), and West Coun-
try Bualo and Broughton Water Bualo farms (UK).December 1, 2018 EvolDir 21
|
The PhD student will be based 75% at Cardi Univer-
sity, spending 50% of the time at the main supervisor's
lab that |specialises |in identifying signatures of se-
lection using genomics in livestock, while 25% of the
time will be spent in Sabah based at Cardi University's
Danau Girang Field Centre collecting bualo samples
in collaboration with the Sabah Wildlife Department
(Collaborator). 20% of the time will be spent with the
Bristol University's supervisor, a world leader in the
development of statistical approaches to study demo-
graphic history using genetic data. 5% of the time will
be spent with the UK collaborators learning about the
water bualo industry in the UK and contributing to
knowledge dissemination in the industry. |
Training: |The PhD student will be trained in sam-
pling and bioinformatics for SNP chip analysis (e.g. data
quality ltering, demographic analyses, and identifying
signatures of selection). This experimental design will
enable the PhD student to characterise the domestica-
tion process of the swamp water bualo and identify
markers associated to local adaptation and production
traits, while controlling for confounding factors such as
the demographic history (to be simulated with approx-
imate Bayesian computation). As part of the BBSRC
SWBio Doctoral Training Program, the student will
have access to several training modules across the four
universities that comprise the DTP (Cardi University,
Bristol University, Bath Univeristy and Exeter Univer-
sity).

ClarkU AnnelidEvoDevo
A PhD position is available in the laboratory of N eva
Meyer at Clark University in Worcester, MA USA be-
ginning late August 2019 as follows:
Spiralians are a great group of animals to study evolu-
tion of body plans in part because many spiralian taxa
develop via a stereotypic and likely ancestral cleavage
program. Ultimately, this cleavage program results in
formation of highly diverse body plans with diverse ar-
rangements of nervous systems, e.g. compare annelids
and gastropod mollusks. Research in Dr. Meyer's lab
is currently focused on understanding how the central
nervous system develops in annelids with the goal of
gaining a better understanding of how nervous systems
evolved. The research community that studies evolution
and development of spiralians is rapidly growing and is
very welcoming and collaborative.
The successful applicant will develop a project focused
on molecular control of neural fate specication in the
annelid Capitella teleta, but this can be expanded to
include other spiralians and dierent avenues of research
depending on the applicant's interests and goals. Pos-
sible avenues of research include analysis of fate speci-
cation via blastomere isolation, genetic manipulation,
and transcriptomic proling. We have a lab colony
of Capitella teleta, and techniques used in the lab in-
clude microinjection of embryos, qRT-PCR, immuno-
histochemistry, imaging of live and xed tissue, quan-
tication of phenotypes using ImageJ, and gene knock-
down and misexpression by injection of morpholinos and
mRNA. We are also currently developing CRISPR/Cas9
gene editing and single-cell RNA sequencing in C. teleta.22 EvolDir December 1, 2018
There will be multiple opportunities for career develop-
ment, including mentoring undergraduate and acceler-
ated M.S. students in the lab, participating as a guest
lecturer in courses taught by the PI, and attending na-
tional workshops such as the Embryology course at the
Marine Biological Laboratories.
The successful applicant will enter Clark University's
Biology PhD program with an anticipated start date in
late August. Previous experience in molecular biology
and working with marine larvae and/or bioinformatics
is desirable. Additionally, the Meyer lab is interested
in creative, engaged applicants who can contribute to
diversity of the academic community, for example via
outreach or mentoring students from historically un-
derrepresented communities. The successful applicant
will be guaranteed funding for ve years through a
combination of research assistantships and teaching as-
sistantships; two years of research assistantship for this
position are currently available.
Clark University is a small but active and highly re-
spected research university located in Worcester, MA.
Worcester has a good combination of urban and outdoor
activities and is in close proximity to a variety of New
England destinations.

Two competitive PhD studentship opportunities are
available in evolutionary ecology and genetics at
Durham University, UK. These fellowships provide
a full tuition fee waiver for the duration of study(3.5 years), a competitive living stipend, and a
considerable research allowance. For more in-

Durham University is consistently rated as one of the
top 100 universities in the world. Located in northeast
England, the university is situated in a scenic town and
lies within a 15-minute train ride of the thriving city
of Newcastle. The department of Biosciences oers a
supportive research-driven environment with projects
ranging from the cellular to the ecosystem level.
AVAILABLE PROJECTS:
1) BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES:
BIRDS, BATS, BEES, AND COCOA TREES
Primary supervisor: Dr. Andreanna Welch (Durham
University) Co-supervisors: Dr. Darren Evans (Newcas-
tle University) Eligibility: British citizens or EU citizens

Deadline: 14 January 2019, but contact Dr Welch by
early January to express interest
Human populations are increasing rapidly and consump-
tion is intensifying. At the same time biodiversity, which
provides critical ecosystem services, is being lost at an
unprecedented rate. Realisation of this crisis has cre-
ated an urgent need to balance agricultural production
with biodiversity. These two objectives are not disjoint,
and indeed, biodiversity can play an integral role in
increasing agricultural yieldsXsustainably. To achieve
balance, we must manage ecosystems for species that
provide support for crops (service species, e.g. species
that provide pest control) as well as those that encourage
biodiversity (species), and especially those that provide
both functions (-over species).
To truly work towards this balance, we must rst under-
stand the food web, because species vary greatly in their
value for agriculture and biodiversity services. The stu-
dent will use state-of-the-art genetics methods to deduce
the diets of animals in the food web of plants, birds,
bats and arthropods in African cacao plantations (the
main ingredient of chocolate). He or she will address:
A) Which member species are most inuential in en-
couraging crop yields and/or increasing biodiversity?
B) Do the above insights change depending on the con-
text of the landscape, e.g. at sites near or far from
forest?
C) How can we use the above insights to manage ecosys-
tems that are both diverse and high-yielding?24 EvolDir December 1, 2018

2) FANTASTIC FAT AND THE EVOLUTION OF
CAPITAL AND INCOME BREEDING STRATEGIES
IN SEALS
Primary supervisor: Dr. Andreanna Welch (Durham
University) Collaborators: Prof. Rus Hoelzel (Durham
University) Eligibility: Open to all students Full Appli-
cation Deadline: 9 January 2019, but contact Dr Welch
by early January to express interest
Seals are often considered icons for how organisms evolve
to adapt to their environment, and they have developed
several strategies to nance their breeding attempts.
The females of some species, called capital breeders,
build up large fat reserves, allowing them to give birth
and nurse their pups for periods of up to several weeks
without feeding. These females may transfer as much
as 30% of their body mass to their pups, and seal milk
contains the highest levels of fat of any mammal species.
The females of other species, called income breeders,
dont build large fat reserves, and instead regularly leave
their pup to forage. Within the family Phocidae, South-
ern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are champion
capital breeders, while Weddell seals (Leptonychotes
weddelli) use mixed strategies, and the harbour seal
(Phoca vilutina) relies more strongly on foraging while
nursing their pups. It remains unclear how the physiol-
ogy of seals has evolved to cope with these strategies.
This project will use genome-scale data to address the
following questions:
A) What is the evolutionary history of phocid seals and
what are the phylogenetic relationships between capital
and income breeding species?
B) Have strictly capital breeding species evolved spe-
cially adapted cellular pathways to convert energy to
fat, store it, and then mobilize it to produce milk with
extremely high fat content?
C) Does dierential gene expression play a role in facili-
tating the use of mixed strategies?

environmental context for evolutionary change.
4) Predicting risk and planning mitigation against re-
gional impact from climate change on populations of
Arctic char (Salvelinus alpines) V supported by the
Durham Arctic CDT (https://www.dur.ac.uk/arctic/).
The key objective will be to use genetic, fatty acid and
ecological analyses to compare high Arctic populations
from Svalbard with lower latitude populations in the
UK to better understand the adaptive dierences and
potential for adaptation or acclimation to a changing
climate in the Arctic environment.

AvianTelomereEvolution
A PhD position is available at the house sparrow lab at
Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus:
Trans-generational eects of age
Inheritance can occur via non-genetic, yet heritable,
mechanisms. The resulting trans-generational eects
can inuence how selection acts and traits evolve. The
idea is that any trauma like environmental stress or
age, can be somehow inherited, and then inuence the
phenotype in ospring and future generations. How-
ever, we do not know the tness consequences linked
to trans-generational mechanisms. This student project
will investigate the trans-generational eects of ageing,
using telomere biology. Telomeres are biomarkers that
predict reduced longevity with age. These non-coding
DNA repeats protect the chromosome ends and shorten
over time. Studies consistently link changes in telom-
eres (telomere length and/or dynamics) with age and
predicted longevity. There is evidence for both heritable
and non-genetic inuences on telomere length, but most
studies point to trans-generational eects V specically,
maternal and paternal eects V explaining some varia-
tion in telomere dynamics. Therefore, this project will
examine trans-generational eects, and inheritance, in28 EvolDir December 1, 2018
telomeres in a wild bird population.
The student will use a longitudinal molecular database
of telomere measurements from a wild house sparrow
population, and support those with focused breeding
experiments in the lab. A better understanding of the
mechanisms that underlie the constraints imposed by
ageing and trauma will signicantly further the eld,
help explain trauma resilience, life-history diversity, the
evolution of longevity and may guide the way towards
a healthy, long life.
This project requires a strong analytical interest in using
large dataset for statistical analysis. Excellent training
in quantitative biology, behavioural ecology and animal
care is available to the successful applicant. Also, this
project involves eld work on Lundy island with wild
birds, so a willingness to spend time on a remote loca-
tion working with wild birds is needed. The student
would be based in Imperials beautiful Silwood Park
Campus 25 miles West of Central London, situated in
about 100ha natural parkland, with a buzzing popula-
tion of 120+ graduate students and 30 world-renown

LinkingIndelityBehaviour
A PhD position is available at the house sparrow lab at
Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus:
Linking indelity with social behaviour
Indelity is common among many taxa with prevailing
social monogamy, but we still do not know what shapes
variation in and drives the evolution of, extra-pair be-
haviour. Males are expected to reap tness benets
from siring extra-pair ospring because extra-pair fa-
thers do not expend resources on costly parental care.
This is, however, not the case for females who raise
the resulting extra-pair young, posing the question of
why females take part in extra-pair matings. The indi-
rect benets hypothesis explains female indelity, where
females benet indirectly from better, or more compati-
ble genes for their ospring. However, this hypothesis
is not well supported empirically, evidenced by two
contradictory meta-analyses on the topic, and ongoing
discussion in the eld, suggesting that this hypothesis
does not satisfactorily explain why females cheat. The
recently suggested novel, testable hypotheses provide a
fresh perspective. These hypotheses explain female in-
delity with intra- and intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy,
and remain largely untested. This project aims to em-
pirically test these hypotheses by using the powerful
combination of long-term data from a wild population,
state-of-the-art social network analysis and manipula-
tive experiments on captive birds. This project will
reap the benets from long-term data in the wild, where
precise tness data and a genetic pedigree allow tness
costs and benets to be measured, and quantitative
genetic analyses. Given the long-standing conundrum
of female extra-pair behaviour, this project has the po-
tential forward this eld signicantly. Methodologically,
using social network analysis to test hypotheses in evo-
lutionary biology is not straightforward, because data
points are relational and thus not independent. This
studentship will explore recent suggestions of randomiza-
tion for social network analysis in behavioural ecology,
and develop respective tools for quantitative genetic
analyses. A good understanding of numerical analy-
ses, linear mixed models, and randomizations is thus
required. Data collection will take place using automat-
ical RFID tags, in a captive and in a wild population of
house sparrows. Thus, this studentship will also requireDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 29
some skills and enthusiasm for working with animals.
This project is in collaboration with Andrs Gyorgy from
the Faculty of Engineering.
Note that this project can involves eld work, with birds
in the laboratory, or mainly desk-based computer anal-
yses, in any combination, depending on the student's
interests and skills. The student would be based in

MosquitoSexualSelection
A PhD position is available at the Imperial College
London, Silwood Park Campus:
Mosquito-borne diseases are thought to directly impact
the well-being and livelihood of at least one-third of
the human population. Our ability to control mosquito-
borne diseases heavily relies on reducing mosquito pop-
ulations. However, the growing incidence of insecticide
resistance threatens current control tools. Several new
strategies will involve the release of laboratory-reared
males which will need to compete successfully with wild
males for mates. Thus, these new strategies will be
greatly facilitated by an improved understanding of the
determinants of male mosquito mating success.
Recently, we manipulated the strength of male com-
petition in replicate populations of the Yellow Fever
mosquito, Aedes aegypti. This species is both an im-
portant arbo-virus vector and one of the main targets
of reproductive control releases. We found that manip-
ulation of the level of male-male competition in mating
environments aects both male competitive mating suc-
cess and other important behavioural and life history
traits. In this project, we will explore the genetic sig-
nature of selection in these replicated populations by
sequencing of pools of individuals from our no com-
petition and high competition populations at several
time points from the course of experimental evolution.
This will allow us to assess the degree to which pheno-
typic changes are associated with changes in the genome,
the localizability of these changes, and the relative in-
uences of genetic drift and selection on the observed
evolutionary response. We will combine this with a30 EvolDir December 1, 2018
set of experiments in a genetically variable mosquito
population that will compare allele frequencies between
more and less successful males ('winners' and 'losers' in
sexual competition).
The student will be supervised at Imperial College's
Silwood Park Campus by Dr. Lauren Cator and Prof.
Austin Burt, experts in mosquito mating behaviour and
population genetics. Additionally, the student will be
supervised by Dr. Brian Hollis of EPFL an expert in evo-
lutionary genetics of sexual selection. The student will
gain skills in mosquito behaviour, genomic techniques,
bioinformatics, and population genetics.

*2 PhD scholarships to investigate the evolution of en-
dosymbiosis in Auckland, New Zealand*
We are currently seeking two PhD students with inter-
ests in genetics, molecular evolution, and microbiology
to conduct research into the evolution of endosymbiosis
using an experimental co-evolution approach in beautiful
Auckland New Zealand.
*How to Apply:*
Interested applicants are encouraged to make infor-
mal enquiries to Dr. Heather Hendrickson. Please
send your Curriculum Vitae, a copy of your academic
transcript, a sample of your written scientic work

H.hendrickson@massey.ac.nz
Applications will be accepted until the position is lled.
It would be desirable if the successful applicant were
able to start by mid 2019.
*Project Description: *
Complex eukaryotic life began when one free-living cell
gave up independence and partnered with another. A
major question in evolution concerns how such partner-
ships are able to form and stabilise. We will study the
early steps in the establishment of endosymbiosis using
an evolution experiment involving protozoan predators
and bacterial prey. Candidates for endosymbiotic in-
teractions will be investigated using a combination of
cutting-edge genomic and transcriptiomic techniques,
uorescent microscopy and ow cytometry. These ap-
proaches will provide a mechanistic insight into the
evolutionary paths that are successful for predation and
a rst glimpse into the process by which individual cells
evolve to form partnerships with unrelated unicellular
organisms.
This project is a collaboration between Dr Heather Hen-
drickson and Dr Elizabeth Ostrowski at the Institute
of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Massey Univer-
sity Auckland New Zealand. Professor Ant Poole, at
neighboring Auckland University, is also a named as-
sociate investigator on this Marsden Funded project.
There is a thriving molecular evolution community in
the Auckland region including an engaged post-graduate
cohort, a monthly regional evolution seminar series and
frequent visiting faculty from abroad. For more infor-December 1, 2018 EvolDir 33

populations. Theories of the evolution of vocal systems
have proposed the 'social-complexity' hypothesis, which
asserts that the diversity and complexity of commu-
nication signals is driven by the complexity of social
interactions within groups, at both the proximate (indi-
vidual, ecological) and ultimate (species, evolutionary)
levels. This project will provide an empirical test of
the social-complexity hypothesis. First, the student will
investigate the interplay between social dynamics, pop-
ulation structure, and vocal call types in a wild parrot.
Second, the project will include a comparative analysis
across psittaciformes. The position is fully funded for 4
years, and open to students of any nationality.
*Position Details:* Research will involve collecting and
analyzing demographic, behavioral, and acoustic data
from multiple populations of birds, as well as conduct-
ing a comparative analysis of the published literature in
parrots (order Psittaciformes). Experimental work in
captivity or the wild addressing mechanisms of social
learning and cultural transmission of vocal communica-
tion is also possible.
*Research Community: *The student will be a
member of the International Max Planck Research
School (IMPRS) for Organismal Biology <http://-
www.orn.mpg.de/2453/Short portrait >, a cooperative
doctoral program between the Max Planck Institute
for Ornithology and the University of Konstanz. The
student will also be integrated with the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, in
the Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Cul-
ture, where statistical and quantitative training in cul-
tural evolutionary analyses will take place. The student
should therefore be prepared to spend signicant time
in both locations.
*Qualications: *Research will involve extensive inde-
pendent eld work, experimental work, bioacoustics
analysis and quantitative data analysis. The ideal candi-
date should have experience in at least one of these areas
as well as a strong desire to learn new skills. Demon-34 EvolDir December 1, 2018
strated ability to engage in independent research is
expected. Applicants should have a masters degree or
equivalent in ecology, animal behavior, zoology, or a

PhD Positions in Fish Evolutionary Developmental Ge-
nomics
The Fish Evo Devo Geno Lab (PI: Ingo Braasch) at
Michigan State University is recruiting highly motivated
PhD students interested in working on the genomic ba-
sis of vertebrate evolution and development to start in
Summer/Fall 2019.
The Braasch Lab focuses on genomic and developmental
changes that contribute to major transitions during the
course of vertebrate evolution and studies evolutionary
novelties at the levels of genome structure, gene familyevolution, and gene regulation. We combine sequencing
and comparative analyses of sh genomes with analy-
ses of molecular evolution and functional genetic and
developmental approaches (CRISPR genome editing,
transgenics, gene expression analyses, epigenomic pro-
ling) in a variety of model species (zebrash, spotted
gar, medaka, and others).
Graduate projects fall within the following broader re-
search areas of the group:
1. Genomic and morphological evolution of shes: How
do morphological dierences among sh and other ver-
tebrate lineages arise from diversication of gene reper-
toires? What is the role of gen(om)e duplications and
gene losses in generating phenotypic diversity? How do
changes in gene regulation contribute to evolutionary
novelties and key innovations? We study a number of
gene families that are of particular importance for the
evolution of the vertebrate body plan, e. g. genes in-
volved in development of the vertebrate-specic neural
crest cells.
2. Conquest of land and sh-out-of-water: We are study-
ing genomic changes and their functional consequences
leading to the evolution of tetrapods from shes and
other sh-out-of-water scenarios, including the evolu-
tionary loss of genes at the water-to-land transition and
the gene regulatory basis of hatching.
3. Evolutionary genomic analyses of zebrash and other
biomedical sh models: Combining genomic sequence
comparisons, gene expression analyses and epigenomic
proling, we aim to improve connectivity of teleost
biomedical sh models such as zebrash, medaka, killi-
shes, etc. to human biology and disease. This work is
support by the NIH.

also Braasch et al. 2016, Nature Genetics
(doi:10.1038/ng.3526) and Braasch et al. 2015, JEZB
(doi:10.1002/jez.b.22589).
The Fish Evo Devo Geno Lab is part of the Department
of Integrative Biology (IBIO), the Ecology, Evolutionary,
and Behavior Program (EEBB), the Genetics Graduate
Program at Michigan State University, and member of
the NSF BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution
in Action.
MSU IBIO has a strong research commitment to ver-
tebrate biology with a highly collaborative community
of groups working on vertebrate and sh evolution, ge-
nomics, development, population genetics, neuroscience,
behavior, ecology, and conservation, allowing for vibrant
exchange among elds, methods and model systems.
Qualications: Applicants should hold a bachelors de-December 1, 2018 EvolDir 35
gree in biology, genetics, genomics, molecular biology,
bioinformatics, developmental biology, zoology or re-
lated elds. Suitable candidates should be enthusiastic
about working in an interdisciplinary manner and have
a passion for sh/vertebrate biology and evolution. Pre-
vious research experience in a relevant area is desired,
but not required.
Admission: Students will be admitted through
the MSU IBIO Graduate Program (https://-

Evolution in action: using museum DNA (and eld-
work!) to understand disease resistance in island birds
Prof DS Richardson <https://people.uea.ac.uk/en/-
persons/david-richardson >(UEA), Dr L Spurgin

CASE Project with Instituto de Productos Naturales y
Agrobiolog??a and collaboration with Natural History
Museum (RICHARDSON UBIO19ARIES)
Many natural populations are facing a \double threat" of
reduced genetic diversity and new pathogen challenges.
Therefore, understanding how hosts adapt to pathogens
in small and fragmented populations has important ram-
ications for conservation, epidemiology and evolution.
However, we still lack fundamental understanding of
the mechanisms that enable natural populations to re-
spond and adapt to changing pathogen pressures. Next-
generation sequencing methods combined with temporal
sampling of wild populations now make it possible to
undertake an exciting, powerful and timely investigation
of these questions.
Methods
You will join a dynamic research programme assess-
ing adaptation within island populations of Berthelot's
pipit, and have full access to large-scale genetic, ecologi-
cal and pathogen data. You will use museum specimens
(1820s), alongside previously collected samples (2006)
and eldwork in
Macaronesia (2020), to quantify spatio-temporal im-
munogenomic variation among divergent populations
known to dier in pathogen load. Genomes from con-
temporary samples will allow you to identify loci that
show high or divergent variation across populations, and
sequence capture will then be used to screen these loci
across samples spanning 200 years. You will then use
population genetic modelling to investigate the evolu-
tionary forces driving immunogenomic variation over
space and time.
Specic questions can be developed and prioritized ac-
cording to your own interests but the work revolves
around the following areas:
1. Identifying spatially and temporally divergent loci
between populations36 EvolDir December 1, 2018
2. Investigating the role of mutational mechanisms in
enabling change at divergent loci
3. Assessing the importance of pathogen-mediated se-
lection and genetic drift in genetic change in small pop-
ulations
4. Testing the role of dierent selection mechanisms in
maintaining immunogenetic variation
Training
You will join a thriving, world class research group at
UEA, spend at least three months at IPNA, (the case
partner in Tenerife) and collaborate with the Natural
History Museum, London.
You will gain
?? Molecular laboratory, bioinformatics and data analy-
sis skills.
?? Ecological eldwork experience
?? Understanding of evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion genetics
?? Training in critical thinking, scientic writing and
the public communication of science
?? Extensive training to increase generic scientic skills
and enhance employability.

PhD Students sought to investigate the evolution of the
human microbiome and its impact on modern human
health using ancient DNA
We are looking for two PhD students to join a dynamic,
cutting edge research team in palaeomicrobiology within
the Department of Anthropology at the Pennsylvania
State University. Selected students will investigate the
evolution of the human microbiome using ancient micro-
bial DNA obtained from calcied dental plaque (calcu-
lus) and Next Generation Sequencing technologies. This
female led research team is actively investigating the
evolution of the human microbiome to understand how
long-term changes in the microbiome impact health and
disease. Using ancient samples obtained from around
the word that date back to 48,000 years ago across six
continents, we are asking how microorganisms establish
themselves in the human body, how diverse bacterial
communities are formed under dierent selection regimes
(i.e. changes in environment, diet, culture, and disease),
and how non-bacterial microbes co-evolved with humans.
In addition, we will explore microbiota in diverse living
populations today to understand how past changes may
inuence modern health and explore environmental mi-
crobiota to see how human microbes may have unique
adapted compared to those in the environment. Our
research team is also analyzing microbial genome evolu-
tion in real-time, investigating the selection pressures
that drive bacterial evolution in diversity microbial com-
munities. To read more about this research, please see

2 PhD Positions in Damsely Speciation and Apose-
matic Weevils, TIGP-BIODIV & NTNU, Taipei, Tai-
wan, 2019
The Systematics & Evolutionary Biology Lab in the
National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) is seeking
two self-motivated and enthusiastic PhD students to
study the speciation of damselies and aposematism of
weevils begin in the Summer of 2019.
1. Damsely Speciation
We focus on a damsely species, Psolodesmus mandari-
nus, with two subspecies dier in their wing pigmenta-
tions, behaviour and distribution in Taiwan, providing
a great opportunity to evaluate the relative importance
of natural and sexual selection in divergence and speci-
ation. We are incorporating a wide range of techniques,
including a whole-island eld survey, behavioural obser-
vation, manipulation experiments, population genetics,
and genomic analysis to investigate the mechanisms
driving the divergence of these damselies.
A short description of research projects:
https://sites.google.com/site/yuhsunhsu/research?pli=-
1 2. Insect Aposematism
Pachyrhynchus weevils are a group of brilliant, metallic-
coloured weevils distributed in the Old World tropics.
Recent studies showed that the conspicuous colouration
of these weevils function as eective warning signals to
prevent predacious pursuit by lizards. The hardness
of the weevils provides the ecient secondary defense
against predation. We are now interested in studying the
multiple functions of the colour and the spatio-temporal
dynamics of the interactions between vertebrate preda-
tors and aposematic prey.

PhD and MS graduate positions in Plant Systematics
and Biogeography
Multiple PhD and MS graduate student positions are
available in the Spalink Lab at Texas A&M University
(https://spalinklab.tamu.edu) beginning Fall 2019. Lab
research concentrates on the intersection of evolution,
ecology, and geography using phylogenetic tools, with
an emphasis on modeling how time, space, and form
function in the diversication and maintenance of life.
The lab's ultimate goal is to merge our understanding
of the evolutionary history of lineages with observedpatterns of biodiversity within and across landscapes.
In observing diversity around the world in the context
of global change, we ask: What is here? Why is it
here? Where is it going? Projects in the Spalink Lab
range from analyzing the dynamics of genetic diversity
within species to the phylogenetics of entire orders, and
from regional patterns of community assembly to the
global structure of phylogenetic, functional, and mor-
phological diversity. Students with interests in a wide
variety of taxonomic groups and geographic localities
are welcomed to apply.
Students with interests or skills in phylogenetics and
any of the following topics are encouraged to apply:
^A Plant systematics ^A Biogeography ^A Community or
spatial ecology ^A Community assembly ^A Population
genetics ^A Species distribution modeling ^A Evolutionary
morphometrics ^A Spatial phylogenetics ^A Bioinformat-
ics^A Conservation biology ^A Genomics and genome
evolution ^A Impacts of global change on species and
communities
Graduate students in the Spalink lab have full access
to the S.M. Tracy Herbarium, a vibrant and rapidly
expanding collection of over 350,000 specimens. Re-
sources for learning or improving bioinformatics skills
abound at Texas A&M University. The university
has multiple core genomics facilities, high-throughput
and high-performance computer clusters, growth cham-
bers, greenhouses, and eld research sites through-
out Texas. Students in the Spalink Lab can opt
for degrees in Ecosystem Science and Management
(https://essm.tamu.edu), Dr. Spalink's home depart-
ment, or the cross-departmental EEB program (https://-
eeb.tamu.edu), of which he is also a core faculty member.
Texas is a fantastic location for botanists. With over
5600 species, Texas is the second most diverse state in
the U.S. With a strong longitudinal precipitation and
elevation gradient, latitudinal temperature gradient, dy-
namic volcanic history, exposed bedrock dating back
a billion years, and an extensive coastline, Texas has
tremendous edaphic and climatic heterogeneity. This
results in everything from extremely arid deserts to wet
conifer forests, and from montane prairies to coastal
plains, all converging in Texas.
Interested applicants should contact Dr. Daniel
Spalink (dspalink@tamu.edu) and provide a description
of your research interests and a CV/resume. We
strongly recommend applying by December 15 to
ensure full consideration for departmental and college
fellowship opportunities. The Department of Ecosystem
Sciences and Management, EEB, and the College of
Agriculture and Life Sciences have many opportunities
for fellowships, research assistantships, and teachingDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 45

Toulouse InfectiousDiseaseModelling
Dear EvolDir list members, Please nd below (and at-
tached) details of a PhD opportunity in infectious dis-
ease modelling in France. Regards, Tim
*PhD in infectious disease modelling* */Modelling and
real-time decision-making: application to the spread
of highly pathogenic avian inuenza (H5N8) virus in
France (2016-2017)/* *Background and objectives*
Limiting emerging infectious disease impact requires tak-
ing quick decisions relating to surveillance and control
strategies. This task, however, is complicated by the un-
certainties that surround the course of disease epidemics.
Mathematical modelling is an extremely powerful tool
that can be used to overcome this problem, but is still
overlooked in the context of emerging animal diseases.
During the winter of 2016-2017, Europe experienced
an unprecedented epidemic of highly pathogenic avian
inuenza (HPAI) H5N8 that had severe socio-economic
consequences for the poultry sector. France was the
most severely aected country with regards to the num-
ber of outbreaks reported in the domestic poultry sector.
Managing sanitary crises linked to avian inuenza virus
circulation is currently one of the major challenges to the
long term security of the European poultry sector. The
aim of the PhD is to assess how mathematical models
can be used in real time to dene adapted surveillance
and intervention strategies in the situation of an animal
disease emergence. To reach this objective, epidemio-
logical data linked to the French HPAI H5N8 epidemic
will be used to calibrate a mathematical model of HPAI
spread in France. This model will incorporate the spatio-
temporal dynamics of the farm contact network, as well
as their geographical proximity. The model and its
outputs will be integrated into a web-based application
to maximise their uptake by policy makers and local
stakeholders.
*Qualications* The suitable candidate would ideally
be a biologist, such as an ecologist, veterinarian, or
agronomist, with a master of science in epidemiology or
ecology and proven quantitative analytical skills, or a
masters' degree in mathematics or statistics. A strong
interest in programming (R, C++ or Python) as well
as good English communication skills would be highly
advantageous. An enthusiasm for infectious diseases,
animal health and interdisciplinary work is desirable.
Prociency in French is not necessarily required * **Institutional arrangements* / Hosting structure /: the
selected candidate will join the EPIDEC team (epidemi-
ology and economics of animal health) of the mixed
research unit ENVT-INRA 1225 |Host-Pathogen
Interactions |, located on the campus of the Na-
tional Veterinary School of Toulouse, France. He or
she will benet from the stimulating environment of
an interdisciplinary research unit whose interests are
located at the interface between epidemiology, immunol-
ogy and microbiology. The selected candidate will also
benet from the national and international collabora-
tion network that the EPIDEC team has developed on
the transmission of infectious diseases. / Supervision /:
Dr. Mathilde Paul (main supervisor) and Dr. Timoth ee
Vergne (co-supervisor) / Research project /: The PhD
project is part of the research project \AI-TRACK"
that received funding from the Occitanie region and
the Regional Development European Fund (FEDER).
The project aims at understanding the transmission
processes of avian inuenza in the French poultry sec-
tor, and at the interface between wildlife and domestic
poultry, in order to optimise surveillance and interven-
tion strategies. / Expected dates /: January 2019 '
December 2022
*To apply* Send a CV and cover letter with

DiseaseEcolEvolution
Ph.D. Positions in Wildlife Disease Ecology and Evolu-
tion
Two graduate student positions are available as part
of an NSF-funded project on the evolution and trans-
mission of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of
anthrax, in two endemic systems in southern Africa.
The project is a collaboration between Wendy Turner
at the University at Albany (www.wendyturner.org),December 1, 2018 EvolDir 49
Pauline Kamath at the University of Maine ( https://-
kamathlab.weebly.com/), and Henriette van Heerden at
the University of Pretoria ( www.up.ac.za/veterinary-
tropical-diseases/article/1945572/h-van-heerden).
Project Background: Anthrax is a globally distributed
disease of wildlife, livestock, and humans that can vary
in its ecology and epidemiology among geographic areas.
These dierences in how and when outbreaks occur has
served as a stumbling block, limiting understanding of
this disease and the ability to predict, and hence respond
to, outbreaks in animals and humans. This project will
compare two areas in southern Africa that have very
dierent anthrax outbreak dynamics: Etosha National
Park, Namibia, where smaller outbreaks occur annually
in grazing herbivores in wet seasons, and Kruger Na-
tional Park, South Africa, where larger outbreaks occur
on roughly a decadal scale in browsing herbivores in
dry seasons. This collaborative project will consider the
roles of host, pathogen, and environment in contributing
to the dierences in the patterns of anthrax occurrence
observed between the two study areas, which are repre-
sentative of the dierences seen among anthrax systems
world-wide. The collaborative project team is study-
ing pathogen landscape genomics over decades in each
system, host immunogenetics and ecoimmunology, host
movement and foraging ecology, population density, and
environment, host and pathogen inuences on outbreak
dynamics.
1. Ph.D. position: Theoretical/Quantitative Disease
Ecology The Turner lab (www.wendyturner.org) at the
University at Albany, SUNY seeks a highly motivated
Ph.D. student in theoretical or quantitative disease ecol-
ogy, to start Fall (or Spring) 2019. This Ph.D. project
will study ecological and evolutionary interactions be-
tween Bacillus anthracis and its herbivorous hosts, con-
trasting two ecosystems varying in anthrax outbreak
dynamics, Etosha National Park, Namibia and Kruger
National Park, South Africa. Competitive applicants
will have previous research experience, a strong quan-
titative background with the skills to confront models
with data (programing, statistical modeling, and/or
theoretical modeling), an interest in conducting eld-
work on charismatic megafauna in African savannas,
and the ability to work independently and as part of
a diverse team. Interested applicants should contact
Dr. Wendy Turner ( wcturner@albany.edu). Applica-
tions must be submitted through UAlbanys Biology de-
partment ( https://www.albany.edu/biology/graduate/-

University of Central Florida, Department of Biology
PhD position in Avian Evolutionary and Conservation
Genomics Inquiry deadline: November 30, 2018 Appli-
cation deadline: January 15, 2019 The Homan and
Savage labs invite applications for a joint PhD position
working on a funded project focused on genomics and
conservation of endangered Florida scrub jays.
Starting date: August 2019 Duration: 4-6 years Compen-
sation: Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA) stipendduring Fall and Spring semesters; Graduate Research
Assistantship (GRA) stipend for at least the rst two
summers.
Project Overview: Construction and other causes of
habitat loss have led to destruction and fragmentation
of suitable habitat for Aphelocoma coerulescens, the
Florida scrub-jay (FSJ). In the past, translocation has
been used as a management strategy for mitigating neg-
ative impacts to many wildlife populations, including
FSJ populations. However, translocation may not be
the ideal solution given that translocation itself can have
negative impacts, particularly for FSJs which exhibit
complex social behavior that may cause diculty in
surviving and reproducing at the site of translocation.
An alternative approach could be to passively manage
FSJs following habitat loss, assess whether they relocate
on their own, and if so, determine whether their survival
and reproduction is based on genomic compatibility
with resident birds. We are conducting a systematic
analysis of the benets of these two strategies - passive
management versus active translocation - by conducting
four years of monitoring and banding FSJs and collect-
ing a variety of samples for genetic, genomic, immunity,
and health assessments. Ultimately, we will incorporate
functional and population genomics, measures of immu-
nity and disease, and survival/recruitment parameters
to integrate structured decision making (SDM) to assess
the long-term feasibility of passive compared to active
translocation when FSJs suer habitat loss.
Dissertation topics and required skills: We are seek-
ing a highly motivated PhD student to focus on whole
genome resequencing and bioinformatics of FSJs, includ-
ing birds impacted by habitat loss and birds that do
not face direct habitat threats. A Master's degree is
not required. However, we will give priority to candi-
dates with extensive bioinformatics experience working
with whole genome or genome-scale datasets in non-
model organisms. The student will have access to and
be a member of UCF's interdisciplinary Genomics and
Bioinformatics Cluster, including computational and
benchtop resources (Savage and Homan both hold clus-
ter appointments). Dissertation focus will be exible,
at the discretion of the student, within the broader con-
text of conservation genomics, population genomics, and
evolutionary genomics using FSJs as the focal taxon.
Inquiries should be directed to Anna Sav-
age (anna.savage@ucf.edu) and Eric Homan

Sexual detection: mechanisms underlying adaptive re-
productive plasticity
How do individuals sense those around them and re-
spond? Apply for this PhD project and nd out!
A collaborative PhD project with Profs Tracey Chapman
and Matt Gage (UEA, UK), Prof Clive Wilson (Oxford)
and Dr Wilfried Haerty (The Earlham Institute, UK).
An important part of being successful is to respond to
rapidly changing environments. Fruity males show
highly precise responses to their social and sexual envi-
ronment. Following detection of rivals (using multiple
sensory inputs), males transfer more ejaculate proteins
to females and sire more ospring. They can even alter
the composition of their ejaculates. The overarching aim
is to nd out how males do this. We think that males
use dierent mechanisms to turn on / o genes and
signals and change the way that ejaculate proteins are
made and expelled. You will test these ideas. You will
test the eect of genetic manipulations of the accessory
glands that make seminal proteins, conduct full genome
sequencing to characterise genetic variation and the
genome-wide signatures underlying weak and strong so-
cial responders and prole changes to male reproductive
cells using high resolution microscopy.

https://www.traceychapmanresearch.com/ and Matt
Gage https://matthewgagelab.com/ Project description
Males and females in many dierent species, including
humans, have dierent longevities and rates of ageing.
Despite the decades of research, we still do not know
why this is the case. The leading hypothesis maintains
the sexes resolve the fundamental trade-o between
survival and reproduction dierently. Because females
produce large expensive gametes (eggs), their tness
often is limited by the amount of resources they can ac-
cumulate and, therefore, females are predicted to invest
into somatic maintenance to ensure longer reproductive
lifespan. On the contrary, males produce numerous
cheap gametes (sperm) and are often limited only by
the number of mates. Therefore, selection favours \live
fast, die young" strategy in males resulting in high re-
productive performance in early life followed by faster
ageing relative to females. Because males and females
share most of their genes, such sex-specic life-histories
are likely dened by sex-specic gene expression. In this
project, we will use the key model organism in genet-
ics, Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, to investigate
how sex-specic gene expression in major molecular sig-
nalling pathways that control life-histories aects sexual
maturation, mating behaviour, ageing, longevity and
reproduction. You will use the power of this system
to modify the targeted gene expression in young and
old animals of both sexes using RNA interference and
assay physiological senescence, reproductive ageing andlongevity. You will test the ultimate prediction that
males invest less than females in somatic maintenance
when they perceive reproductive opportunities. This
PhD is an opportunity to investigate one of the big
questions in biology - why do we age - from the unique
angle of sexual dimorphism in life-history.

UEdinburgh PopulationGenetics
PhD Position available at the Institute of Evolutionary
Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK.
Supervisors: Matthew Harteld, Jarrod Hadeld Ti-
tle: How are multiple adaptive genes aected by an
organisms' frequency of sex?
Project Description: Reduced costs of genome sequenc-
ing have seen an expansion in the amount of genetic data
available from various species, from which researchers
are learning more about the crucial evolutionary process
of adaptation. Yet the vast majority of existing methods
for quantifying selection acting on the genome assume
that organisms are completely sexual. Many organisms,
including crops and plant pathogens, are instead capable
of some degree of ^Auniparental reproduction', where
individuals can produce ospring without needing a sec-
ond parent. These includes hermaphrodites that are
capable of self-fertilisation (where individuals produce
both male and female sex cells that can fertilise one an-
other), or facultative sexuals (where individuals produce
some ospring via clonal reproduction).
While we understand how reproductive modes aect a
few genes that carry adaptive mutations, these results
are unlikely to scale to the more realistic scenario where
adaptation is caused by many genes scattered through
a genome. In this highly interdisciplinary project, the
student will create mathematical models to understand
the nature of genome-wide adaptation, and develop
novel methods to test those models through analysing
genetic data. There will be potential to investigate a
wide range of organisms, including highly self-fertilising
plants (Arabidopsis thaliana; Capsella rubella; Medicago
truncatula), those whose occurrence of self-fertilisation
varies throughout its range (Arabis alpina), and plant
pathogens (e.g. the Phytophthora genus that infects
strawberries). The project will provide the student with
cutting-edge mathematical and bioinformatics skills fortheoretical prediction and genome sequence analysis,
which are essential for modern biology research.
The expected starting date is October 2019.

UExeter ResistanceEvolModelling
Graduate position: UExeter.ResistanceEvolModelling
Title: Hindering evolution of resistance to pesticides
through optimizing landscape structure and application
practice
Location: University of Exeter, Streatham Campus,
Exeter EX4 4QJ
Primary Supervisor: Dr. Wolfram Moebius, Depart-
ment of Physics and Astronomy, College of Engineering,
Mathematics and Physical Sciences
Additional Supervisors: Dr. Ricardo Kanitz, Syngenta
Crop Protection. Dr. Tim Rogers Department of Math-
ematical Sciences, University of Bath. Prof. Ivana
Gudelj, Department of Biosciences, College of Life and
Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter.
Aim: Explore the eects of landscape structure and ap-
plication of crop protection on the evolution of resistance
to pesticides
Background: The evolution of pesticide resistance isone of the main issues faced by agricultural practice
throughout the world. The ability of the industry's
Research & Development engines to generate new prod-
ucts has not managed to keep up with the rate in which
pests develop resistance. Understanding the eect of
landscape structure and temporal use of pesticides will
bring insight into resistance management strategies.
Project: The project will investigate how landscape
structure and use of pesticides inuence the evolution of
resistance. To achieve this goal, extensive simulations
and theoretical work assuming simplied models for the
spread of pests and evolution of resistance will be used.
These ndings will be combined with detailed models
capturing most of the complexity of selected pests and
crop protection agents. We anticipate that the results
can be used to develop optimization routines to identify
landscapes and application schemes of crop protection
agents that hinder resistance evolution and mitigate its
consequences.
Funding, training, and experience to be gained: Funding
is available for 3.5 years. During this time, the candi-
date will be trained and gain research experience in
mathematical biology and simulation techniques. The
project will be co-supervised by researchers with experi-
ence in evolutionary biology, mathematics, and physics.
The project represents an opportunity to join the com-
munity at the Living Systems Institute, benet from
cross-institutional supervision, and includes a placement
in a world-leading company. The combination of mod-
elling, simulations, and application will provide a very
competitive skill set.
Suitability: The project is suitable for candidates with
dierent backgrounds, ranging from mathematics to
physical and biological sciences.

Invasive bees, invasive disease. The ecology and evolu-
tion of parasites associated with bumblebees in South
America, Japan, and Europe
Project Description Bumblebees are crucial pollinators
in both wild and agricultural systems. Bumblebees are
also facing widespread declines, in part due to infectious
diseases, which challenges the stability of wild oral
communities, and the animals that depend on them,
and food security. The common European bu-tailed
bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) has been successfully
commercially reared and is used extensively to pollinate
crops around the world. In many of these regions, B.
terrestris has established and spread, and local bum-
blebees have declined. One potential cause of the local
declines of bumblebees is the introduction of European
diseases.
This studentship will use next-generation sequencing
approaches to identify parasites that are associated with
native bumblebees in South America and Japan, where
B. terrestris is invasive and European parasites can
now be found, and European bumblebees, where these
parasites may have originated. This program of work
will characterize whole communities of parasites asso-
ciated with a community of hosts and how these have
changed with the invasion of European bees. As such,
it will represent a step-change in understanding multi-
host multi-parasite communities, their interactions, and
present clear data about the role of infectious disease in
bumblebee declines.
The ideal student for this project would be one who
wishes to apply their molecular biology/genomics skills
to large-scale ecological problems. This project will
suit a student with interests in host-parasite interaction,
evolutionary ecology, genetics, bioinformatics, and ge-
nomics. Existing skills in any of those areas would be
helpful but independence, curiosity, a healthy sense of
humor, and a certain amount of grit are usually more64 EvolDir December 1, 2018
important.
The successful student will have the opportunity to work
closely with collaborators in South America and Japan
and develop skills in evolutionary ecology, host-parasite
interaction, immunology, genomics, transcriptomics, and
metagenomics. The Institute of Integrative Biology of-
fers a lively community of researchers to interact with,
providing many opportunities for collaboration.

ULiverpool MicrobialCommunities
A PhD Studentship is available at the University of
Liverpool to work on soil microbial communities.
This project is supervised by Dr Siobhan OBrien (Liv-
erpool) and co-supervised by Prof Steve Paterson (Liv-
erpool) and Prof Mike Brockhurst (Sheeld).
Project Description: Understanding how microbial com-
munities evolve and function is regarded as one of todays
greatest challenges. Microbial communities are highly
diverse and complex, yet this same complexity makes it
extremely challenging to understand how a community
might respond and adapt to change. Experiments using
simple 2-species communities have shown that species
interactions can aect evolutionary responses to the
abiotic environment, yet we have little idea about how
selection operates within communities in more realistic,
natural settings.
In this project, you will test how species interactions
in complex microbial communities shape evolution-
ary responses to environmental change, focusing on
agriculturally-relevant soil microbial communities. Soil
microbial communities are key drivers of agricultural
processes such as nitrogen provisioning, protecting crops
from pathogens and heavy metal bioremediation. Hence,
understanding how these communities adapt to envi-
ronmental change is vital. You will perform experimen-
tal evolution in real-time with natural microbial soil
communities and test the eects of various agricultural
stressors such as pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics
on community structure and function.
This project lies at the interface of evolutionary biology,
community ecology, microbiology and environmentalsciences. The ideal student for this project will be one
who wishes to apply their evolution/ecology background
to gain novel insights into how microbial communities
respond and adapt to change.
The student will be embedded within a supportive and
vibrant research community at the Institute of Integra-
tive Biology at the University of Liverpool, and gain
skills in experimental evolution, microbial cultivation
techniques, sampling natural microbial communities,
molecular biology and metagenomics. While existing
skills in any of these areas would be helpful, the ability
to drive a research project independently, strong inter-
personal skills, motivation and curiosity are essential.
PhD students are strongly encouraged to participate in
the range of professional development activities oered
by the University of Liverpool, and training will be pro-
vided in research skills such as scientic writing, critical
thinking, reviewing literature, presentation skills and
statistical analysis.
Applicants should generally have an upper second or rst
class degree in biological or life sciences, evolutionary
biology, ecology, zoology, microbiology, environmental
sciences or any other relevant elds.

Application deadline: December 15th, 2018
We invite applications for a 3-year PhD position (65%
TV-L E13) on the role of chemical footprints for in-
terspecic interactions in ants. While walking, ants
leave chemical cues on the ground. Other individuals
can detect these footprints and re-spond to them ' by
avoiding them, approaching them or altering their ag-
gression. Such responses can inuence colony tness,
but also competition between colo-nies or species. How-
ever, the behavioural, chemical and ecological factors
behind these responses, as well as their consequences
for intercolonial and interspecic competition are stillDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 65
largely unknown. The PhD candidate will investigate
these questions using behavioural experiments, chemical
analyses, and agent-based models. The project links
behaviour, chemical ecology and community ecology in
empirical and simulation studies.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with
an MSc degree (or equivalent) in Biology or a related
eld. The successful applicant should have a strong back-
ground in ecology, animal behaviour and/or evolutionary
biology. Experience with social insects, statistics and/or
programming are advantageous but not required. The
working language of the laboratory is English. The Uni-
versity of Mainz aims to in-crease the number of women
in science, and applications by women are strongly en-
couraged. Similarly, qualied candidates with disabili-

AdaptiveRadiationGeometry
Holey hypervolumes! The multivariate geometry of
adaptive radiation.
We seek a maths, physics or engineering graduate with
an interest in biology, or a biologist with good mathemat-
ical skills, for an exciting, international, interdisciplinary,
collaborative PhD to investigate multidimensional varia-
tion in the shape (phenotype) of sh, and the ecological
characteristics of the environments they inhabit. The
successful candidate will use large existing datasets to
develop cutting-edge analyses of multivariate phenotype
distributions, ecological variables and the relationships
between them, within a phylogenetic context. The stu-
dent will receive training in advanced mathematical
and statistical methods, and in evolutionary biology,
including eldwork in Scotland, and practical training
in quantication of morphological phenotypes. The suc-
cessful candidate will be based in Nottingham, but will
visit Arizona State University, USA.
Many individual properties of environments and organ-
isms ('phenotypes'), such as pH, temperature, colour
or size have continuous distributions, which makes it
tempting to assume that all possible combinations of
environmental and phenotypic variables can occur in the
natural world. However variables are commonly intercor-
related: as one changes, so do others, and this can mean
that certain combinations are rare or missing when plot-
ted in multidimensional spaces ('hypervolumes'). The
existence of discontinuities ('holes') in environmental or
phenotypic hypervolumes are relevant to thinking about
e.g. niche structure, the evolution of biodiversity and
transitions between environmental states. They could
be important for our understanding of the consequences
of environmental change and organisms' abilities to re-
spond to it.
Until very recently the detection of holes in multivari-
ate space has not been possible, but Ben Blonder, an
assistant professor at Arizona State University, and a
project collaborator, has recently developed a method
to do so (2016, American Naturalist). This project willDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 67
use his method, and others, to develop novel mathe-
matical analyses of existing data describing multivariate
variation in three spined stickleback sh and their envi-
ronments, as they adapt to those environments during
adaptive radiations (the dierentiation of an ancestral
species into divergent new populations or species). We
aim to address three simple, but novel questions, and
to then develop further analyses: (a) Are there holes in
multivariate phenotypic distributions? Their existence
would suggest constraints on the lling of phenotypic
space. (b) What constraints might be responsible for
phenotypic holes? They might coincide with environ-
mental or genetic discontinuities. (c) Do holes represent
phylogenetic constraints or opportunities? Holes could
represent 'the road not taken' in a taxon's evolutionary
history, but could also represent evolutionary opportu-
nity in the taxon's future.
The project will be based in the MacColl lab, http://-
ecology.nottingham.ac.uk/AndrewMacColl/index.php,

Two BBSRC-funded four year studentships at the Uni-
versity of Nottingham, open to UK and EU students.
Project 1) the genomic basis of chiral variation in mirror-
image snails
Project 2) developing germline transgenesis methods in
snails.
Both UK and EU students eligible, closing date Tue
11th Dec 2018, fully funded for four years. Email me for
further info angus.davison@nottingham.ac.uk. Apply
here https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/bbdtp/ 1) How
are snails able to routinely make mirror-image shells
and bodies, unlike any other animal group? In previous
work, we identied a gene in pond snails which deter-
mines variation in asymmetry, but the mutation means
that only about half of embryos develop to hatching. In
other snails, especially those in Japan and Hawaii, mir-
ror image versions are common and equally t. In this
project, the student will use genomic methods (RAD-seq
and/or nanopore) to identify the genes associated with
chiral variation in these other snails, with a long term
aim of understanding why such variation is not possible
in other animals, including ourselves.
Project would suit student into some combination of
genomics/evolution/development/bioinformatics. Field
work in Japan/Hawaii a likely option, if desired.
2) Slugs as pests destroy and spoil crop plants and
cost the farming industry at least £100M a year in the
UK, incurring the widespread use of toxic molluscicides.
Slugs and snails are also vectors of important pathogens
(e.g. schistosomes). Unfortunately, very little is known
about the genetics and molecular biology of gastropod
molluscs, and as a consequence, we are unable to bring
modern methods to bear upon the control of problem
species. Therefore, the specic aim of this PhD is to
develop a straightforward and robust method to deliver
transgenic vector constructs into the snail germline,
with a long term view of using the method to devise
methods for control of crop pests and snail vectors of
disease. Taking advantage of progress made in the ro-
tation, the student will formulate, develop and them
optimise methods for accessing and then culturing snail
embryos. He/she will then work with others towards
the goal of stable transgenesis of snails.
The project would suit student into molecular biology68 EvolDir December 1, 2018
and also possibly micromanipulation.
Both projects will involve an initial training/rotation
in three diverse labs. Students then select one for their
PhD project. Note that you do not necessarily have
to have a masters level qualication to gain entry to a
PhD course

SpeciationMitonuclearConict
Competitively funded PhD position Mitonuclear Con-
ict and Speciation in Stickleback
The successful applicant for this multidisciplinary, inter-
national project will combine cutting-edge bioinformat-
ics and physiological assays of mitochondrial function
with traditional genetic analysis, behavioural experi-
ments and eldwork to assess the contribution of mito-
chondrial dysfunction to speciation in an evolutionary
model species, the three-spined stickleback. Ecological
eldwork will take place in the Scottish Outer Hebrides,
and there will be opportunities for visits to collaborating
labs in Germany and Canada.
Mitochondria, the \powerhouse" of all eukaryotic cells,
are intimately involved in many cellular processes. \Co-
adapted gene complexes" comprised of both nuclear
and mitochondrial genes must work closely together in
the production of energy by oxidative phosphorylation
(oxphos) and other processes. The breakdown of this
essential biochemical cooperation results in organismal
dysfunction including many human diseases. Dysfunc-
tion may arise when populations come into secondary
contact following divergence, and untested combinationsof mitochondrial and nuclear genes must work together.
This has stimulated a novel hypothesis for the process of
speciation, Darwin's \mystery of mysteries". Any break-
down of nuclear-mitochondrial coadaptation following
hybridisation between divergent taxa may be a common
cause of reproductive isolation (the inability of individu-
als from dierent populations to successfully mate with
each other). Thus far, this idea has been examined in
only a handful of organisms, and only once in vertebrates.
This studentship will investigate the contribution of mi-
tonuclear conict to speciation in stickleback, a small
sh with excellent genomic resources.
Three-spined stickleback have repeatedly colonised fresh-
water from the sea. The contrasting energetic and os-
motic demands of marine and freshwater environments
exert strong selection on genes involved in oxphos path-
ways, potentially favouring strong selection on nuclear-
mitochondrial coadaptation. On the Scottish island of
North Uist there are hybrid zones between marine and
freshwater stickleback populations that originate from
distinct mitochondrial clades that are ~120,000 years di-
verged. Hybridisation in these contact zones is strongly
asymmetric, with freshwater mtDNA introgressing into
marine sh, but not vice versa. This is strongly sugges-
tive of mitonuclear conict contributing to speciation
in these sh.
Training rotations for this project will allow students
to learn skills directly relevant to the project, with
substantial components of wet lab molecular genetics,
physiology and bioinformatics.
The project will be based in the MacColl lab, http://-

DiatomMetaBarcoding
PhD student position in the application of high-
throughput sequencing DNA tools (metabarcoding) in
aquatic ecology, announced jointly by the Centre for
Climate Change (C3) at the University Rovira i Vir-
gili (URV) and the Marine and Continental Waters
Program of the Institute for Food and Agricultural Re-
search Technology (IRTA) in Sant Carles de la Rpita
(Spain).
Ref of the PhD position: 2018PMF-PIPF-22
Topic: Diatom metabarcoding: developing new tools for
bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems
Project description: Aquatic ecosystems are essential
to planetary function and to humans and hence their
protection and restoration are of vital importance. The
Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Frame-
work Directive were adopted by the EU more than 10
years ago to ensure good functioning of water bodies in
terms of biological communities and hydrological and
chemical characteristics. Diatoms and plankton are
among the principal biological indicators used to moni-
tor waters for these directives and, until now, they have
been assessed through microscope-based assessments of
communities. This thesis project aims to develop innova-
tive alternatives to microscope-based assessments, using
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and DNA metabar-
coding. This will include (1) understanding how method-
ological and biological parameters aect the relationship
between DNA reads (from HTS) and cell numbers, (2)
developing DNA reference databases, (3) developing ap-
propriate bioinformatics pipelines for converting HTS
reads into ecological assessments, and (4) rening knowl-
edge about the relationship between species occurrences
and ecological factors in particular critical cases (to
test current assumptions about species ecology). To
do this, the candidate will assemble and use matched
sets of HTS data, microscope-based diatom counts, and
physico-chemical data. As well as providing the basis
for new biomonitoring systems, the project may pro-
vide novel data on the biogeography of microalgae and
protists, touching on general questions of dispersal anddierentiation in populations of microscopic organisms.
Initially, the focus will be on diatom biomonitoring of
Catalan rivers, but the project may extend into coastal
habitats and include the opportunity to develop new
methods of detecting pathogenic or toxic species and to
analyse the hidden diversity of previously unrecognized
or unidentiable organisms.
Requirements: The candidate must have a degree in
biology or related disciplines. Preference will be given
to candidates familiar with bioinformatics tools for the
analysis of DNA sequence data or practical experience
in molecular techniques such as DNA extraction, PCR
and DNA sequencing. Good analytical skills will be
an advantage, and some knowledge of algae, including
diatoms, would be helpful though not essential. Knowl-
edge of R would also be an asset. Good communication
skills in written and spoken English are necessary. Ap-
plicants should note that the research activities will
take place at the IRTA centre in Sant Carles de la Rpita
(under the supervision of Dr. Rosa Trobajo and Dr.
David G. Mann) but that the PhD student will work in
close collaboration with other labs working on similar
projects, both in Spain and internationally.

USunshineCoast HumanGenomics
Human Genomics PhD Scholarship at the University of
the Sunshine Coast, Australia
Humans migrated out-of-Africa over 60,000 years ago
and spread to dierent parts of the globe. In this process
human population was subsampled serially along the
routes of the migration. This project will investigate the
footprints of migrations manifested in the frequencies
and patterns of genetic variations in human populations.
The main research foci of our group include the eects
of genetic drift in modulating mutation and selection,
quantifying mutational load, investigating the rates and
patterns of mutations, estimating divergence times be-
tween species and populations and ancient genomics.
We work on a number of species including humans and
other mammals, birds and oysters.
The current project focuses on a) investigating genetic
relationships and gene ow between global human pop-
ulations. b) estimating the mutational load in humans
c) understanding the unique patterns of genetic vari-
ations in dierent human populations. All the above
objectives will need to be examined in the context of
human migrations out of Africa.
This project involves collecting samples for whole
genome sequencing and performing a series of bioin-
formatic analyses to process raw sequence data. The
processed data will need to be analysed using a range
of methods in population genomics and evolutionary
biology to answer the questions related to objectives
mentioned above.
The project provides an opportunity to work and ac-
quire knowledge in inter-disciplinary sciences such as
molecular biology, genetics, computer science and statis-
tics.
SELECTION CRITERIA:
Academic qualications - An honours or master's de-
gree in biological, physical or computational sciences is
highly preferred; however, persons with a non-biology
degree should have some basic understanding of genetics,
evolution and molecular biology

and its consequences in terms of population viability.
Strong sexual selection can improve population viability
and evolvability through a number of processes, such
as genic capture. However, strong sexual selection will
also often give rise to sexual conict and female harm,
which does not only tend to deviate females from their
evolutionary optima, but can drastically aect popu-
lation viability, leading to aoreproductive tragedy of
the commons. We are still far from understanding
what factors modulate the evolution of female harm
levels, and sexual conict at large, and how this feeds
back into population viability. Our on-going research
aims to contribute to ll these gaps in knowledge by
investigating factors potentially modulating the evo-
lution of sexual conict. This PhD will explore the
role of dierent ecological and demographic factors (e.g.
temperature, population density and structure) aect
male-male competition levels and the potential for sex-
ual conict, mainly in Drosophila melanogaster. The
research project involves behavioural experiments in the
lab, experimental evolution, and considerable eldwork
in Spain, the USA and Australia.
Funding We oer funding for 3 yrs, but applicants will
be expected to apply for independent PhD fellowships.
Where? The student will be supervised by Dr. Pau
Carazo, and based at the Behaviour and Evolution
group of the Ethology Lab, at the Cavanilles institute
of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology (University of
Valencia, Spain). For information about our group visit

UYork 4 LeishmaniaPopGenetics
The University of York (UK) is now welcoming appli-
cations for a four year PhD position in the population
genomics of the parasite Leishmania infantum.
The project links parasitology expertise at York, with
medics in Brazil and population genomics experts in
York and Sheeld. Deadline: Monday, January 07,
2019 Location: York (UK) and Brazil. Restrictions:
The funder requires UK/EU citizenship.
More detail: https://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID2576 Applying genomic
surveillance to understand Leishmania infantum vir-
ulence in Brazil.
Leishmania infantum is a globally-distributed parasite
that is transmitted via sand ies. Leishmania infan-
tum and the related Leishmania donovani cause 20,000-
30,000 deaths per year, mainly in Brazil, India, and
Africa. This project will use cutting edge genome se-
quencing and population genomics methods to uncover
mechanisms of drug resistance. This knowledge will be
applied to rapid genomic typing of parasites in Brazil,
enhancing treatments.
The project will start by describing the complex land-
scape of Leishmania populations in Brazil. You will
uncover new aspects of the history of the parasite by
analysing L. infantum and L. donovani genome data
from hundreds of clinical isolates from Brazil, India and
Israel. This exploration will form the background ge-
netic landscape to inform the reminder of the project.
You will then learn how to apply genome wide associ-
ation studies (GWAS) to detect genetic changes that
aect drug resistance and/or parasite virulence. Tests
for evolutionary change will be used detect new ge-
netic changes that are sweeping through the population,
spreading drug resistance. Genetic changes that are
particularly striking will be examined using CRISPR-
Cas9 genome editing, to uncover the mechanistic details
underlying the genetics.December 1, 2018 EvolDir 75
Finally, you will develop methods for extremely rapid
genome sequencing that can be performed on-site in
Brazil. You will rst develop an application of Ox-
ford Nanopore Technology to collect genome data from
Leishmania infantum isolates and identify the genetic
alterations in the genome. This will allow us to use our
genomic knowledge (from GWAS, CRISPR and selection
tests) to characterise drug resistant or virulent strains
while the patient is still in treatment. You will then
apply this rapid genomic diagnostics in Brazil. This
approach has real potential to save lives.
The project will be supervised by Daniel Jeares (Uni-
versity of York), with Kai Zeng (University of Sheeld,
population genetics), and Jeremy Mottram (University
of York, Leishmania biology), with researcher/medical
collaborators in Brazil. The student will learn cutting
edge genomic methods, population genomics, CRISPR-
Cas9 genome editing and will spend time in Brazil de-
veloping rapid, on-site genome sequencing.

TransposableElementEvolution
LINKING ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS TO TRANS-
POSABLE ELEMENT ACTIVITY
We are oering a four year PhD position at the
Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, Univer-
sity of Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Anne
Roulin and Dr. Michael Thieme (for more on
the group: https://www.botinst.uzh.ch/en/research/-
evogenomics/roulin.html).
Background Transposable elements are mobile DNA se-
quences that constitute the main component of most
eukaryotic genomes. TEs are also functionally impor-
tant as they can lead to the creation of alternative or
new promoters, the rewiring of regulatory networks and
the alteration of epigenetic landscapes. While their mo-
bility is normally restricted by a sophisticated silencing
machinery implemented by their hosts, external stresses,
however, can lead to their mobilization and induce sta-
ble transgenerational genetic changes. TEs may thus be
especially prone to produce the raw diversity necessaryfor individuals to respond and adapt quickly to new or
changing environmental conditions. Hence, the stress-
induced mobilization of TEs is increasingly seen as one
of the major drivers of phenotypic diversity and plant
evolution.
Aims of the project We have previously developed a
method to circumvent the strict epigenetic regulation
of TEs in plants. This allowed us for the rst time to
study the eects of stress-induced transposition events
in Arabidopsis thaliana. We were able to show that
the stress-induced mobilization of a heat responsive TE
indeed caused a broad panel of phenotypes and an al-
tered response to environmental cues such as day length.
Using the same approach, your PhD project will aim at
studying the mechanisms of TE-mobility in the model
plant Brachypodium distachyon. By tracking TEs in
various accessions from dierent habitats, we want to
observe and understand TE-mediated evolution in real-
time. These ndings will make a major contribution
towards the understanding of the adaptive potential of
TEs and will have direct implications for the use of TEs
in plant breeding programs, as B. distachyon is closely
related to major crops.
You are ... ??? interested in plant
(epi)genetics/physiology/ecology/evolution and
willing to develop skills in molecular biology and
bioinformatics. You will be encouraged to come up with
your own ideas and creativity in order to shape your
PhD project according to your interests. The successful
candidate must hold a master degree in biology (or in a
related eld).
How to apply ? Send a PDF le including
a cover letter, a CV, and contact information
of 2 referees to anne.roulin@botinst.uzh.ch AND
michael.thieme@botinst.uzh.ch before 31.12.18. For

candidate will spend approximately three months in
Panama, beginning in late January 2019. The position
is open to all students with a background in zoology
and interest in animal behaviour or neurobiology.
*Heliconius *butteries exhibit a marked expansion of
the mushroom body, a region of the insect brain associ-
ated with learning and memory, being 3-4 times larger
than in other Lepidoptera, including closely related Heli-
coniini genera. The EBAB Lab is investigating both the
developmental basis and behavioural consequences of
this expansion through developmental timeseries of neu-
ral tissue and behavioural experimentation across both
*Heliconius *and non-*Heliconius *Heliconiini species.
The primary responsibilities of the eld assistant will
be to maintain stock buttery populations and rear
caterpillars. There will also be opportunities to col-
lect wild butteries from surrounding forests, assist
with behavioural experiments on long-term memory and
reversal-learning ability, and learn to perform butterybrain dissections. This is an excellent opportunity for
a recent graduate to gain experience in behavioural ex-
perimentation, experimental design and eld collecting.
Dates: starting and nishing dates are exible, but ide-
ally the successful candidate will be available for three
months, beginning in late January 2019.
Funding: the successful applicant will receive 800 USD
per month, which comfortably covers living costs while
in Panama. STRI requires that all researchers have
health insurance, this is not provided but can be pur-
chased through STRI at the applicants cost. Financial
assistance with air travel to and from Panama will be
available if required.
Accommodation: application can be made for accommo-
dation through STRI or arranged privately. Accommo-
dation costs are approximately 250-300 USD per month.
Gamboa is a small town, with all facilities within com-
fortable walking distance.
Interested applicants should have training in zoology or
a related eld, and should send a CV and brief state-
ment of research interests to Fletcher Young (etcher-

2019
** Salary: 568.5 e/month
** Location: the internship will take place at the UMR
BioGeCo at the INRA site of Cestas-Pierroton (INRA
/ University of Bordeaux). The site oers a pleas-
ant setting within a forest estate located between Bor-
deaux (20km) and Arcachon (40km) (see: https://-
www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inra.fr/biogeco/Acces). The
research campus is accessible by public transport from
the train station of Cestas-Gazinet (2 bus shuttles per
day).* Background * Conifers, the most abundant group of
gymnosperms, are a unique system for the study of
adaptive evolution because they represent the largest
and longest living terrestrial organisms, dominate many
of the temperate and boreal forests and are adapted to
a large variety of environmental conditions (Diaz-Sala
et al. 2013). Evolutionary models of angiosperm kary-
otypes have been proposed recently thanks to compari-
son of available sequenced genomes for several important
species (Salse et al. 2008, 2015; Murat et al. 2010) .
These studies showed that angiosperm genomes have
evolved through frequent, rapid chromosomal rearrange-
ments, including whole-genome duplications (WGDs)
followed by nested chromosome fusions. On the other
hand, conifers have particular genome features that slow
down knowledge on genome evolution. For instance,
conifers have extremely large genomes (ranging from 18
to 35 Gb) characterized by the presence of repetitive
elements (Kovach et al. 2010; Mackay et al. 2012).
These features complicate attempts to sequence the
genomes of this group of plants and the recently re-
leased draft genome sequences are highly fragmented
(Nystedt et al. 2013; Zimin et al. 2014; Warren et al.
2015; Stevens et al. 2016; Neale et al. 2017). One
ancient WGD event is known to have occurred before
the angiosperm'gymnosperm split around 350 Ma (Jiao
et al. 2011). However, whether other WGD events have
occurred during the evolutionary history of conifers is
still a matter of debate between the scientic community.
Nysted et al. (2013) did not nd evidences of recent
WGD in Picea abies and advocated an intense activ-
ity of transposable elements as the main mechanism of
genome size increment in conifers (Stevens et al. 2016).
On the contrary, Li et al. (2015) reported a WGD for
the Pinaceae and another for the Cupressophyte clade.
In addition, most of the genomic studies in conifers have
been performed within the Pinaceae, the largest fam-
ily of conifers, and it has been well demonstrated that
Pinaceae genomes present high levels of interspecic
and intergeneric synteny and macrocollinearity (Kru-
tovsky et al. 2004; Pelgas et al. 2006; Pavy et al.
2012), suggesting a lack of chromosomal rearrangement
within this family. Nevertheless, a comparison between
Pinaceae and Cupressaceae revealed intense chromoso-
mal shuing between both families (de Miguel et al.
2015). Further studies on genome structure, function
and evolution including dierent conifer families are
needed in order to decipher whether evolutionary mech-
anisms identied in angiosperm genome evolution have
also played a key role in the evolution of conifers.
* Project * The Master2 project will take advantage of
the previous work developed by this team in the con-
struction of a high-density consensus genetic maps forDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 121
Pinaceae (updated from de Miguel et al. 2015) and
other published conifer linkage maps (Moriguchi et al.
2016). High density genetic maps are a valuable tool in
the absence of completely assembled genome sequences
for conifers. Combining gene position information (ob-
tained from high density genetic maps) with publicly
available transcriptomic and genomic sequences for sev-
eral conifer species (Li et al. 2015) a comparison of
genome structure and function will be performed. The
main objective of this Master project is to study the
genome structure and evolution in conifers. Three main
tasks will be pursued: 1. Genome structure compari-
son between conifer species on the basis of high density
genetic linkage maps. 2. Validate or refute the exis-
tence of recent WGD during the evolution of conifers.
3. Analyze gene-turnover (gain and loss of genes in
particular gene families) during conifer evolution. The
completion of this project will contribute to understand
unique features of conifer genomes that may shed new
light to understand the

We are looking for a master 2 student for an internship

*Title: Using population genetics demographic methods
to infer speciation history of species complexes with
high gene ow: comparing pairwise and multi-species
approaches. *
*General information * Supervisor: Dr. Ludovic
Duvaux (INRA Pierroton, France) Co-supervisors: Dr.
Carole Smadja (CNRS Montpellier, France), prof. Roger

*Practical information * Lab location: the laboratory
is situated on a small campus between Bordeaux (20
km) & Arcachon (40 km). Being dedicated to wood
and forest management, it oers a nice working environ-
ment within a beautiful forest domain and gives promi-
nence to wooden structures and furniture. Transport:
The campus is connected to accommodation speci-

*Project summary * The large amount of genomic data
available nowadays allows us to infer the demographic
history of species. It is especially interesting to use
these data and methods to infer the history of species
dierentiation, that is to understand the process of spe-
ciation. Methods of demographic inferences generally
consider 2 populations/species at a time. Although
straightforward, this can lead to spurious results where
one considers complexes where several species present
incomplete reproductive isolation to each others (aka
species complexes). Methods do exist to analyse multi-
ple species simultaneously, however they require to know
the phylogeny of incipient species a priori. This pre-
requisite is really complicated to full for some species
complexes as high levels of gene ow can strongly blur
the real phylogeny of incipient species. Therefore, there
is no satisfying method currently in existence to infer
simultaneously the order of incipient species separations
(aka the phylogeny) and the speciation parameters (rate
of gene ow between incipient species, divergence time,
eective population sizes) for species complexes with
high gene ow. Using an approximate Bayesian com-
putation framework including machine learning, this
project aims to determine the best way to infer the spe-
ciation history of species complexes with high gene ow
by comparing pairwise and multi-species approaches of
demographic inferences.
*Description * Background: The large amount of
genomic data available nowadays allows us to infer
the demographic history of species (e.g. estimations
of population size, gene ow rates and divergent

Citation for PairwiseDistance
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
may i ask if any of you has ever seen before the princi-
ple underlying the huge potential speed up of pairwise
comparisons quickly presented below?
and if so, would you know how the trick is called and a
citation or perhaps the details of an eventual informal
communication?
everybody tells me the trick must be well-known but
nobody can point to a publication or an informal remark
by somebody.
stuart kurtz (compsci uofc) tells me the trick almost can-
not be exploited by standard computers but allows one
to express everything with C pointers very compactly.
best greetings and thanks in advance!

===given a data column with say ve binary-marker
entries
1: 1 2: 0 3: 0 4: 1 5: 0
let's get the ten pairwise comparisons of the ve entries,
i.e., 1vs.2, 1vs.3, 1vs.4, 1vs.5, 2vs.3, 2vs.4, 2vs.5, 3vs.4,
3vs.5, and 4vs.5and let's use 1 for \match" and 0 for \mismatch"
the rst batch of pairwise comparisons is 1vs.2, 1vs.3,
1vs.4, and 1vs.5: 1vs.2: 0 (mismatch) 1vs.3: 0 (mis-
match) 1vs.4: 1 (match) 1vs.5: 0 (mismatch)
it happens that when data entry 1 is the binary marker
1, one can use directly data entries 2, 3, 4, and 5 as
pairwise comparisons 1vs,2, 1vs,3, 1vs,4, and 1vs.5, i.e.,
0, 0, 1, 0.
for 2vs,3, 2vs,4, and 2vs.5, we have 2vs.3: 1 (match)
2vs.4: 0 (mismatch) 2vs.5: 1 (match) it happens that
when entry 2 =/= entry 1, one can use NOT(entries 3,
4, 5)= NOT(0, 1, 0)= 1, 0, 1, as pairwise comparisons
2vs,3, 2vs,4, and 2vs.5.
for 3vs.4 and 3vs.5 one has 3vs.4: 0 (mismatch) 3vs.5: 1
(match) since entry 3 =/= entry 1 one uses NOT(entries
4, 5)= NOT(1, 0)= 0, 1
nally for 4vs.5 one gets 4vs.5: entry 4: 1 (mismatch)
entry 4 = entry 1, so one uses directly entry 5= 0 as
pairwise comparison 4vs,5
obviously when data entry 1 is the binary marker 0, one
uses NOT( markers 2 to 5 ), i.e., 1: 0 ( <{ now 0) 2: 0
3: 0 4: 1 5: 0 i.e., one uses directly NOT( data entries 2,
3, 4, and 5 ) as pairwise comparisons 1vs,2, 1vs,3, 1vs,4,
and 1vs.5, i.e., NOT( 0, 0, 1, 0 ) 1, 1, 0, 1.

ESEB ProgressMeetings
CallForProposals DeadlineNov30,
***Progress meetings in evolutionary biology***
We are excited to announce the second round of a new
initiative by the European Society of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy (ESEB), in partnership with the Journal of Evolu-
tionary Biology (JEB).
We invite applications for funding to support focussed
conference or workshops on a topical issue where rapid
progress is currently being made in understanding Evolu-
tionary Biology. ESEB will supply funds up to 15,000
to assist with workshop planning (venue, travel or at-
tendance support). We encourage proposals on any
topic.
We expect these meetings to bring together a range
of researchers focussed around a topic for aostate of
the artconference, ideally proposing a new synthe-
sis, viewpoint or technical or analytical breakthrough
facilitating new avenues of research. Attendees would
represent researchers from all career stages and must
accord with our Equal Opportunities guidelines. Atten-
dance should be open to all, but ESEB members should
be prioritised. Typically, meetings would last 2-3 days.
A condition of the funding is that the meeting has a
clear objective to produce either a Special Issue or Tar-
get Review for JEB. Within 4 months of the meeting
manuscripts arising from the meeting should be submit-
ted to the journal, to be handled by the organisers as
guest editors or the editorial board of JEB, as appropri-ate.
This is a novel opportunity for a one-o topical meeting
for ESEB members and the evolutionary community.
There will be one round per year, with a deadline of Nov
30, 2018. Applicants should be members of ESEB or our
sister society, the Society for the Study of Evolution.
There is no ocial application form. The application
document should include
- The title of the conference and why this is suitable for a
Progress Meeting. - Names and addresses of the organis-
ers, with short (1 page each) CVs - List of keynote speak-
ers, with justication (potentially key recent references).
They should have agreed in principle to participate - A
2-page description of the aims and potential scope of
the conference - Conference venue details - Methods of
selecting participants - Publication plans
Queries and applications should be submitted to of-
ce@eseb.org by the deadline. People are also welcome
to approach any of us at the forthcoming joint meeting
in Montpellier. The successful application will be chosen
by an ESEB committee.

Phyloseminar SebastianDuchene

Next on http://phyloseminar.org/: Model adequacy
in infectious disease phylodynamics Sebastian Duch^ ene
(University of Melbourne) Thursday, November 29, 2018,
1:00 PM PST
Statistical models are widely used in phylogenetics to
infer the evolutionary history of groups of organisms. In
the context of rapidly evolving pathogens, phylogenetic
analyses can be used to make inferences about epidemi-
ological processes, a eld known as infectious disease
phylodynamics. A key component of phylodynamic
analyses is a branching model to describe transmission.
For example, coalescent and birth-death models can es-
timate the average number of secondary infections using
phylogenetic trees. However, the resulting inferences are
contingent on the extent to which models describe key
aspects of the data. For example, the simplest models
in phylodynamics assume that transmission rates are
constant over time and lineages, which is not neces-
sarily the case for many empirical data sets. In this
talk I will discuss model adequacy methods in phylody-
namics. In contrast to model selection, where models
are ranked according to their statistical t, the goal of
model adequacy is to determine whether key aspects
of the data at hand could have been generated by the
model in question. That is, to assess the absolute, rather
than relative, model t. Model adequacy typically con-
sists of simulating data from the model and comparing
them to the empirical data. The crux of such compar-
isons is to develop summary statistics that represent
the expectation under the model. Using examples from
dierent virus data sets I will present several approaches
to assess phylodynamic models to reveal the importance
of modelling population dynamics, such as population
structure and variation in transmission rates, in epi-
demiological estimates. Finally, I will illustrate ways
in which an uptake of these approaches can improve
our understanding of infectious disease evolution and
motivate the development of models in phylodynamics.

The Geiler-Samerotte Lab (https://biodesign.asu.edu/-
kerry-geiler-samerotte) in the Center for Mechanisms
of Evolution at Arizona State University (ASU) invites
applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate in
the area of evolutionary cell biology. Research in the
Geiler-Samerotte Lab focuses on understanding how ba-
sic features of cells (e.g. induction of a stress response)
modify the phenotypic impact of mutations. To ad-
dress this question, the lab utilizes high throughput
approaches in yeast to quantify how the impact of muta-
tions changes as the environment or genetic background
is subtly altered. These measurements yield testable
predictions about how new mutations will interact or
about the ranges of conditions in which evolution ex-
periments performed in the lab will follow the same
trajectories.
The ideal postdoctoral candidate has strong interest in
evolutionary biology, strong wet-lab skills in cell and
molecular biology, as well as experience with some of
the following: yeast or microbial cell culture, next gen-
eration sequencing library preparation, genome editing
technology (e.g. CRIPSR), high-throughput data analy-
sis, scripting in python or the R programming language,
knowledge of population genetics and statistics. Op-
portunities to gain experience in the aforementioned
categories, as well as experience teaching and mentoring
students, are available.
The Geiler-Samerotte lab oers a vibrant work en-
vironment. The lab is housed in the newest re-
search building (opened in 2018) of the BiodesignInstitutes at ASU, featuring an open oor plan in
the laboratory as well as lounge areas that encour-
age collaboration within the Center for Mechanisms

SpeciationGenomics
*Postdoc position on speciation history in nightingales*
*Available from May 2019 to December 2021 (the start-
ing date is exible) Application deadline: 21th December
2018*
*Project description:* Patterns of genetic variation
within and between species enable to make inferences
about demographic history of species, levels of post-
divergence gene ow as well as evolutionary forces act-
ing on specic genes. Such information can provide a
valuable insight into the history and mechanisms of spe-
ciation. This project aims at understanding the complex
history of speciation in two closely related passerines,
the Common Nightingale and the Thrush Nightingale,
that hybridize in a zone of secondary contact. The suc-
cessful candidate will use the whole-genome sequences
from multiple individuals of both nightingale species
from sympatric as well as allopatric populations. These
data will be used to (1) model the demographic history
of species divergence, (2) explore the genomic landscape
of interspecic dierentiation and divergence and iden-
tify specic genomic regions with reduced introgression
between species that underlie reproductive isolation, (4)
identify specic genes with signs of adaptive introgres-
sion, and (3) seek for signatures of selection on sympatric
populations, which might unravel mechanisms of rein-
forcement and/or ecological character displacement at
the genetic level. The results will provide a unique in-
sight into the mechanisms or species origin as well as
the role of genetic introgression in adaptive evolution.
*Candidate experience:* The successful candidate will
be mainly responsible for the bioinformatic part of the
project. The position requires experience in analysis of
large-scale next-generation sequence data and the ideal
candidate should have background in population genet-
ics. Programming skills are desirable. Experience in the
wet lab is a plus, but is not necessary. The candidate
may be involved in the eldwork if he/she wishes.
*Research group:* The selected candidate will work in
a young independent research group of population and
speciation genetics. The group is based at the Depart-
ment of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles University,
which belongs to the leading research institutions in the
Czech Republic. The Faculty of Science is situated in132 EvolDir December 1, 2018
the center of Prague, one of the world's most beautiful
and monumental cities. Please see the web pages of

Mouse
GENETIC MAPPING IN MOUSE INTERSPECIFIC
HYBRIDS USING *IN VITRO* CROSSES (Hybrid-
MiX)
Friedrich Miescher Laboratory, Max Planck Campus,
Tubingen, Germany
Two postdoctoral positions (both for 2 years in the rst
instance) are available in the Chan Lab at the Max
Planck Institute in Tubingen as part of our HybridMiX
team, which is supported by an 1.5M EUR European
Research Council (ERC) grant on using \in vitro" mi-
totic recombination crosses to study species dierences
between mouse species.
The key innovation in the HybridMiX project is the
development of in vitro recombination (IVR) in tissueculture, specically in F1 interspecic hybrid mouse ES
cells for genetic mapping (see Lazzarano et al., PNAS,
2018). IVR allows us to create recombinant cell lines
across species of eectively unlimited panel size, at low
costs and within. We now aim to map the evolutionary
divergence between mouse species at the tissue and cellu-
lar level by generating interspecic panels and obtaining
their phenotypes via tissue engineering, organ-on-a-chip
or droplet microuidic single-cell methods.
We're looking for highly motivated candidates (both
wet and dry-lab) to contribute to the broader team ef-
fort in our HybridMiX project in tissue engineering and
genetic mapping. The successful candidates should be
about to earn, or have recently earned their PhD in
the areas of genetics, molecular biology or regenerative
medicine (wet-lab position); or statistical, functional or
quantitative genomics (dry-lab computational position).
Successful candidates should demonstrate their early
career success in the form of a rst author publication
or preprint in prep. The ideal candidates should have
the following qualications.
1) Wet-bench Postdoc: You should demonstrate exper-
tise in tissue culture techniques, especially in the area
of dierentiation or ow-based cultures. Alternatively
you may be familiar with single-cell techniques and with
performing functional genomics experiments such as
RNAseq, ATACseq and ChIPseq. Together, we aim to
use these approaches to dissect the genetic architecture
of gene expression evolution in mouse tissue models.
For this position, a background in genetic mapping or
GWAS will be advantageous.
2) Data analysis Postdoc: You should have a strong
background in analyzing genomic data and the pro-
ciency to handle large datasets, (e.g. skills in Unix,
R and scripting or programming languages). In our
projects we routinely integrate information from diverse
sources, including single-cell, linked-read, chromosome
conformation capture, as well as image analysis to assist
with our analyses of cellular and tissue-level phenotypes
and genotypes.
For both positions, a background in evolutionary biology
will be helpful, but not a requirement. We are interested
in candidates who are keen to apply and develop new
genetic tools and technologies. You will have plenty
of opportunity to develop independent research ideas
within our in vitro cross framework.
We are a multidisciplinary team that focuses on the
systems biology of development and evolution in mice,
combining population and functional genomics with
molecular biology and tissue engineering techniques
to investigate the evolution of complex genomes like
the mouse. Our research group is funded by the ERC138 EvolDir December 1, 2018
and the Max Planck Society and is located on the Max
Planck Campus in Tubingen, Germany. The Max Planck
Tubingen Campus is a highly innovative research hub
with world-class genomics and machine learning exper-
tise. Our sequencing core features the Illumina, PacBio
and 10X Genomics platforms. English is the working
language. All seminars and communications are in En-
glish.
The position is available for an initial 2 years with the
possibility of extension. Salary and benets are accord-
ing to the German public service pay scale (TVoD Bund
up to and including E13) and are commensurate with
training and experience.
The Max Planck Society seeks to increase the number of
women in areas where they are underrepresented, and
therefore explicitly encourages women to apply. The
Max Planck Society is committed to employing more
handicapped individuals and especially encourages them
to apply.

Post-doctoral fellow in Comparative Population Ge-
nomics of Betulaceae
Seeking a motivated and creative research fellow to join
the Salojarvi research group at Nanyang Technological
University, Singapore.
*Project Description:
In this project you will carry out a comparative popula-
tion genomics study of three closely related sympatric
forest tree species from birch family, two diploids and
one tetraploid, each having slightly dierent life styles
and ecological niches. Altogether 20 sites from Eurasia
have been sampled, and high-quality reference genomes
for the species have been completed within the group.
Whole genome sequencing of the populations will be car-
ried out to identify convergent and diverging patterns
of adaptation among the species, and to understand
the extent of gene ow as well as historical populationdynamics.
Trees within the birch family have several properties
which make them an interesting model for tree genomics.
The trees can be easily inbred, and in many cases hy-
brids between related species can be established. This
hybridisation is present also in nature and across species
with dierent ploidy levels. Genetics can be studied by
controlled crosses, since owering can be induced within
less than a year from germination. There is an ongoing
co-operation with Uppsala Universitet in Sweden to esti-
mate mutation rate and establish birch as the foremost
temperate forest tree model.
*Research Environment:
The work is carried out in the research group of Asst.Prof
Jarkko Saloj arvi. The group studies population ge-
nomics and evolution in plants. A particular research in-
terest is the link between microevolution and macroevo-
lution, that is, adaptation in populations versus long-
term evolution at genome level. The group is divided
between Nanyang Technological University at Singa-
pore and University of Helsinki at Finland. The Sin-
gapore group is recently established and focuses on
computational analyses, for which the host university
has provided ample resources. NTU was ranked the
fastest-rising young university globally by Times Higher
Education, and 12th in the world in the 2019 QS World
University Rankings.
The Finland group was established in 2014 and is a part
of Academy of Finland Center of Excellence in Molec-
ular Biology of Primary Producers and Viikki Plant
Science Centre. The group is located within the Viikki
Biocentre campus, which has exceptional research fa-
cilities such as state-of-the-art core facilities for next
generation sequencing and high-throughput plant phe-
notyping. Several research visits to Finland during the
research fellow position will be expected.
*Required Qualications and Application Instructions:
The candidate should preferably have a PhD in popu-
lation genomics and necessary skills to learn advanced
statistics. Experience from R/Python, shell scripting,
and strong background of working in a Linux environ-
ment with whole genome sequencing data is required.
The position is initially for one year with a possility of
extension up to two years, and salary range is 4,400-
5,000 S $/year. Starting time is exible, but preferably
between December 2018 - January 2019.
To apply, please send a letter of motivation describing
your reasons for applying to the position, CV, tran-
scripts and contact details for at least two references.

Dear all,
Please nd below an opportunity for a postdoc position
for 24 months at iEES Paris in Chemical Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology.
Mission A post-doc position is available in the
Chemoreception and adaptation team (https://-
ieesparis.ufr918.upmc.fr/spip.php?article240). Our
group is mainly interested in dissecting the mechanisms
of olfactory reception in insects and in understanding
their evolution in a changing environment. In moths,
reproductive success largely depends on mate recogni-
tion through the detection of species-specic bouquets
of air-borne chemicals called pheromones. The diver-
sication of pheromone signals has likely played a key
role in the extensive radiation observed in moths as it
seems to be one of the main mechanisms responsible
for the evolution of reproductive isolation. Recently we
have identied genes underlying pheromone reception in
pest moths of the genus Spodoptera, but gene families
involved in pheromone production remain poorly stud-
ied. Studying the evolution of these genes is crucial to
understand how pheromone communication can evolve
and participate in reproductive isolation.Activity The candidate will use standard molecular bi-
ology and bioinformatics analyses in order to identify
genes potentially involved in pheromone production, and
characterize their expression patterns (using RT-qPCR)
in 4 species of the genus Spodoptera. The candidate will
also use biochemistry approaches (yeast transformation,
GS-MS analyses) to determine the substrate specicity
of candidate enzymes that may be responsible for the
evolution of pheromone blends.
Skills We are seeking a highly motivated candidate hold-
ing a PhD in Life Sciences, and with a strong interest for
evolutionary biology. Experience in biochemistry and
in molecular biology is mandatory, and a background in
bioinformatics would be a plus. The candidate should
have strong communication and organization skills, and
be uent in English.
Context The post-doc position is available in the sen-
sory ecology department of the Institute of Ecology
and Environmental Sciences of Paris. This depart-
ment involves 10 researchers from Sorbonne University
(Paris) and Inra (Versailles), and uses a unique combina-
tion of know-how, including bioinformatics, functional
genomics, molecular genetics, biochemistry, physico-
chemistry, neuroanatomy, imaging, electrophysiology,
ethology and modeling, developing approaches from
genes to elds, from neurons to biophysical models,
from individuals to populations. The lab will provide
all the bench equipment and facilities required for the
project, which is funded by an ANR grant.
Contact The formal selection process will start early
2019. The contract should start before spring 2019. The
term of this post is 24 months. CV and motivation
letter should be send to nicolas.montagne@upmc.fr and
thomas.chertemps@upmc.fr

Stockholm University
Closing date: 14th of December 2018
We are seeking to recruit postdoctoral fellow interested
to work in the multidisciplinary project \Cognitive evo-
lution in guppies". The project uses the guppy (Poecilia
reticulata) as a model to comparatively and experimen-
tally investigate the factors driving cognitive evolution.
As such, the project spans over multiple disciplines in-
cluding eld collections, articial selection, assays of
behaviour and detailed tests of cognitive ability, brain
imaging and neural density estimations, and analyses
of the genomic architecture that orchestrates changes
in brain anatomy and cognitive ability.
The project will use both animals from wild populations
with known dierences in ecology, and from a selection
experiment. These animals will be subjected to relevant
assays of behaviour, brain anatomy and genomics. The
overall aim of the project is thus to increase our under-
standing of the evolutionary relationship between brain
anatomy, cognitive ability and the genome.
The work will mostly be lab-oriented but includes at
least one eld trip to Trinidad. The project will require
hard work but at the same time provide excellent oppor-
tunities for personal initiatives and development towards
pursuing a successful academic career. The project is
undertaken in a brand new section of the large tropi-
cal freshwater sh labs in the Department of Zoology
with established assays of brain anatomy, several dier-
ent aspects of cognitive abilities, swimming parameters,
personality, individual and collective behaviour, etc.
Postdoctoral positions are appointed primarily for pur-
poses of research. Applicants are expected to hold a
doctoral (PhD) degree.
The position is funded by a tax-free 2-year Carl-Tryggers
postdoctoral scholarship. Start date: as per agreement.

resources and food supply for future generations is a
rapidly growing challenge that requires an understand-
ing of how populations will respond and adapt to current
and future environmental stressors. Salmon produce
food and recreation for the people of the Pacic North-
west and are the keystone species of coastal ecosystems
and human economies within this area. Yet, salmon
populations are under pressure and we do not under-
stand the epigenetic and genetic factors that inuence
their odds of survival. In particular, while hatchery pro-
grams release millions of sh yearly, it remains unclear
how many of these released salmon survive and whether
they contribute to increasing the wild population size.
The PDF will join a unique and growing partnership
between the Nitinat River Hatchery, the BMSC, Depart-
ment of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the Ditidaht
and Huu-ay-aht First Nations to test the environmen-
tal and genomic consequences of alternative hatchery
salmon rearing practices. The PDF will work closely

AshDiebackResistance
The Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource
Management (IGN) together with the Natural History
Museum, Denmark (SNM), under the Faculty of Sci-
ence, invites applications for a 2-year postdoc position
connected to a collaborative research project funded
by the Danish Council for Independent Research. The
position starts April 1st 2019 or soon thereafter.
The announced contract is one of two postdoc posi-
tions in the above-mentioned project, which has the
objective to explore the evolutionary potential of nat-
ural populations of European common ash (Fraxinus
excelsior) to cope with two calamities, the ash dieback
pathogen (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) and the Emerald
ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). The project is headed
by Lene Rostgaard Nielsen (IGN, KU) in collaboration
with national and international researchers. The specic
postdoc project will harness whole-genome resequencing
to explore the genomic architecture of resistance of com-
mon ash to the ash dieback pathogen by 1) detecting
loci under selection that confer ash dieback resistance
and 2) determining if and how resistance is correlated
with tness-related traits. The successful candidate will
be involved in eld (phenotyping of trees exposed to the
pathogen) and laboratory work, and bioinformatic and
population genomic analyses of data. The fellowship
includes collaboration with Prof Tom Gilbert's team
at SNM, and a research stay with Associate Professor
Mike Martin at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.

The Bernatchez's Lab at University Laval (Qu ebec City,
Canada) is currently searching for a postdoctorate re-
searcher to be involved in a new research project entitled:
Brook charr aquaculture production adapted to climate
change; the importance of transgenerational epigenetics
factors.
This is a an ambitious project funded for 3 years by the
NSERC (Canada) Strategic Partnership Grants program
which will be conducted in collaboration with colleagues
Celine Audet (Ecophysiologist, University of Rimouski)and Dany Garant (Quantitative geneticist, University
of Sherbrooke). The selected candidate will also join
Bernatchez' 30-member team of the Canadian Research
Chair in Genomics and Conservation of Aquatic Re-
sources which aims to enhance fundamental knowledge
pertaining to the evolutionary processes responsible
for generating and maintaining genetic diversity within
populations of aquatic animals, with relevance for man-
agement and conservation.
CONTEXT AND GOALS: The objective of this research
project is to provide the scientic basis for the estab-
lishment of sh production methods aiming to support
the brook charr recreational sheries (Salvelinus fonti-
nalis), which will be adapted to the new environmental
context resulting from climate change. Three objectives
integrating the study of epigenetic variation and gene
expression combined with the acquisition of physiologi-
cal information and components of phenotypic tness
and interpreted in the conceptual framework of evolu-
tionary quantitative genetics are targeted: 1) testing the
eect of thermal regime during adult sexual maturation
and ospring incubation on epigenetic (methylation)
changes that may aect survival, growth and resistance
to thermal variation during development of young stages
of life; 2) estimating, through a factorial crossing de-
sign, the heritability and gene-environment interactions
of transgenerational plasticity eects on the variation
of these phenotypic traits as well as the expression of
genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms and physiologi-
cal performance; 3) assessing the eects of changes in
the thermal regime during the production of brook charr
on the persistence of methylation patterns, growth, sur-
vival and heritability of these traits following stocking
in the wild.
This project will also contribute to a deeper understand-
ing of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic processes,
in particular to elucidate which phenotypes respond to
trans-generational epigenetic transmission and thus clar-
ify the importance of these mechanisms in the adaptive
potential of aquatic species. Ultimately, this knowledge
will help better predict adaptation potential to climate
change.
Required Qualications: As the recruited person will
mainly be in charge of the methylation aspects of the
project, we are primarily searching for a prospective
candidate with strong and demonstrated bioinformatics
and analytical skills to analyse genomic and epigenome
(methylation) data sets.
The position is for two years, potentially renewable for a
third year and to be lled as soon as possible. The salary
is established according to local University standards.
To apply, please send a cover letter describing150 EvolDir December 1, 2018

ecology, often by studying model species that consti-
tute the foundation of important marine ecosystems,like large brown algae (kelps) and marine angiosperms
(seagrasses). We use molecular techniques and statis-
tical modeling to understand organism's reproductive
systems; to infer the causes and consequences of vari-
ation in allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction;
and to interpret genetic connectivity across dierent
levels of spatial organization, from single populations
and metapopulations to whole range distributions. Re-
cently, we expanded our topics to applied research by
developing a genomic selection program in seaweed aqua-
culture. We are looking to hire a postdoctoral research
that would contribute to our goals with genomic analysis
expertise.

** DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS
EXTENDED UNTIL NOV 15 **
We are delighted to announce that we will have a SMBE
satellite meeting 'Towards an integrated concept of adap-
tation: uniting molecular population genetics and quan-
titative genetics' 11-14 February 2019 in Vienna, Aus-
tria.
This workshop will bring together theoreticians and
empiricists, covering both molecular population genet-
ics and quantitative genetics, with the implicit goal to
develop the basis for a unied framework of adaptive
genetic architectures. The new concept will in turn
provide predictions that translate into guidelines for
the most informative experimental designs, to uncover
underlying adaptive processes.
We will have talks by invited speakers from both theoret-
ical and empirical elds (Drosophila, yeast, Arabidopsis,
human, sticklebacks, domestic animals). We will also
have discussions in working groups on development of
the new unied concept of adaptive traits and nding
new analytical approaches.
Registration: Since the meeting is sponsored by SMBE
and Vetmeduni Vienna, we can waive the registration
fee for all participants. However, registration is compul-
sory. Registration deadline: Dec 31, 2018. Note: Pleaseprovide your rst and last name, aliation and status
(MS/PhD student, postdoc, PI).
Abstract Submission: For contributed talks, submit your
250-words abstract by NOV 15, 2018. The deadline for

Dear Colleagues,
Registration is open for Transmitting Science course
oIntroduction to Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics 
Instructors: Dr. Erik Postma (University of Exeter,
UK) and Dr. Jes2s Martnez-Padilla (Universidad de160 EvolDir December 1, 2018
Oviedo, Spain).
Dates: April 8th-12th, 2019, Barcelona (Spain)
Place: Capellades, Barcelona (Spain).
Course Overview:
Quantitative genetics uses the phenotypic resemblance
among related individuals to infer the role of genes and
the environment in shaping phenotypic variation.
By simultaneously using the resemblance among all in-
dividuals in the pedigree, these methods provide more
precise and accurate estimates of genetic and non-genetic
variance components (heritabilities and genetic correla-
tions). Furthermore, they allow for the estimation of
individual-level genetic eects (breeding values), and
thereby the inference of evolution.
In this course, we will cover everything from basic quan-
titative genetic theory and statistics to advanced mixed
model-based approaches. You will learn how to estimate
genetic variances and covariances in wild and captive
populations, and how to test for evolutionary change.
Along the way, you will be exposed to the main soft-
ware packages, and the R packages MCMCglmm and
ASReml-R in particular, and you will learn about their
strengths and weaknesses.
You are strongly encouraged to bring your own data (if
you have it), which you will be able to work on during
the course and which will allow you to put the theory
into practice.

Overview
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the concepts of de novo assembly and anno-
tation. Dierent technologies, from Illumina, PacBio,
Oxford Nanopoor and maybe 10X will be used mixed
with dierent approaches like correction, HiC scaolding
to generate good draft assemblies. Particular attention
will be given to the quality control of the assemblies
and to the understanding how errors occur. Further,
annotation tools using RNA-Seq data will be introduced.
An outlook of potential analysis is given. In the end of
the course the students should be able to understand
what is needed to generate a good annotated genome.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learning
more about genome assembly and annotation. It will
include information useful for both the beginner and
the more advanced user. We will start by introducing
general concepts and then continue to step-by-step de-
scribe all major components of a genome assembly and
annotation workow, from raw data all the way to a
nal assembled and annotated genome. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
command line Linux.
Attendees should have a background in biology. We
will dedicate one session to some basic and advanced
Linux concepts. Attendees should have also some famil-
iarity with genomic data such as that arising from NGS
sequencers.

courses-workshops/course38 This course is aimed at
researchers and technical workers with a background
in biology and a basic knowledge of Python (if you've
taken the Introductory Python course then you have
the Python knowledge; if you're not sure whether you
know enough Python to benet from this course then
just drop us an email).
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the example datasets. They
should also have some basic Python experience (the
Introduction to Python course will fulll these require-
ments). Students should be familiar with the use of
lists, loops, functions and conditions in Python and
have written at least a few small programs from scratch.
Students will require the scientic Python stack to be
installed on their laptops before attending; instructions
for this will be sent out prior to the course.

Portugal NicheModelling Feb11-15
Ecological niche models (ENM), and/or species distribu-
tion models (SDM), are a series of computer algorithms
designed to predict the distribution of species in geo-
graphic space based on a mathematical representation
of their distribution in the environmental space. These
state of the art tools are frequently used in dierent
biological disciplines such as ecology, biogeography, evo-
lutionary biology or conservation. The aims of this
course are to provide (1) an overview of the theoretical
aspects, applications and techniques of ENM, and (2) a
series of practical cases exemplifying relevant scientic
uses of ENM.

which will be delivered by Dr. Fritz Sedlazeck and Dr.
Matthias Weissensteiner in Glasgow city centre from
the 29 April - 3rd May 2019
Course Overview:
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the eld of comparative genomics. The course
will give a deeper understanding on the advantages and
disadvantages of each of approach in general to enabling
an informed decision of study design for the participants
for future studies and learn the cutting edge approaches
to process state of the art data sets. Dierent tech-
niques will be introduced to identify single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and structural variations (SVs)
as well as the annotation of these variations and the
assessment for their functional impact.
We will give a broad introduction on how to:
1. Process short and long read data based on multiple
NGS data sets including mapping and de novo assembly
2. Detect SNP and Structural Variations using de novo
assembly, short or long read mapping 3. Assess the
impact of the detected variations 4. Perform population
genetic analysis between multiple samples to obtain a
deeper insight into these variants.
Furthermore, we will teach on how to install and man-
age these methods and give an introduction in Cloud
computing. This will enable the participants to set up
ecient pipelines on their own institutions. The course
will conclude with the participants being aware of the
state of the art approaches and a deepened knowledge
to decide which study design is the optimal for future
studies .

UK SurvivalAnalysis Jan21-25
Statistical modelling of time-to-event data using sur-
vival analysis: an introduction for animal behaviourists,
ecologists and evolutionary biologists (TTED01)
https://www.psstatistics.com/course/statistical-
modelling-of-time-to-event-data-using-survival-analysis-
tted01/ This course will be delivered by Dr.n Will
Hoppitt for the 21st - 25th January 2019 in Glasgow
City Centre
Course Overview: Survival analysis is a set of statistical
methods initially designed to analyse data giving theDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 169
times at which individuals die, and assess the eect
that dierent predictor variables have on the rate of
death and is therefore useful for studying population
dynamics and patterns of marine mammals. However,
its applications are much broader than this: it can be
used to analyse any time-to-event data. Ecologists and
evolutionary biologists often encounter data of this kind.
Often factors inuencing survival itself will be of inter-
est. But there are many other cases, e.g. what factors
inuence the time of rst breeding? Or the time taken
to reach maturity? Animal behaviourists too will en-
counter this type of data frequently, e.g. what factors
inuence the time it takes to learn a novel behaviour pat-
tern? Or the time to respond to a stimulus? etc. And
yet the techniques of survival analysis are not generally
well known by researchers in these disciplines.
In this course, you will learn how to apply survival
analysis models to quantify the eect that predictor
variables (continuous or discrete) have on the rate at
which events occur, and how to test hypotheses about
these eects. We will focus on a exible modelling
technique called the Cox proportional hazards model,

When: March 12th - March 28th 2019
Location: Berlin, Germany
Application deadline: December 31st 2018
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ In this in-
tensive 17 days course, students will learn how to survive
in a Linux environment, get hands-on experience in two
widely used programming languages (Python and R),170 EvolDir December 1, 2018
and statistical data analysis. The classes will be given by
experts in the eld and consist of lectures and exercises
with the computer. The aim of the course is to provide
the students with the necessary background and skills to
perform computational analyses with a focus on solving
research questions related to genomics and evolution.
The philosophy of the course will be \learning by doing",
which means that the computational skills will be taught
using examples and real data from evolutionary biology
for the exercises. During the course, students will also
propose projects of their own interest and perform them
as nal projects in small groups under the supervision
of a teaching assistant. This summer school is open for
students from all countries and targeted toward PhD
students and postdocs of evolutionary biology or related
research elds with no or little programming experi-
ence who want to become procient in computational
evolutionary biology in a couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the Free University of Berlin.

4bs19-41 . Course description:
Understanding organismal development and its evolu-
tion has been one of the biggest challenges for biology
since its earliest beginnings. It is the central aim of
developmental biology to elucidate the mechanisms un-
derlying pattern formation and morphogenesis. By ex-
tension, evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo)
is also considered a \mechanistic science." But what ex-
actly is meant by \mechanism" in these contexts? What
is a developmental mechanism? What is a \mechanism"
in developmental evolution? How do these \mechanisms"
contribute to evolutionary change? The answer to these
fundamental questions is far from clear. And yet, clarity
on this foundational conceptual issue is essential for re-
search progress, not only in development and evolution
but far beyond, as the nature of the term \mechanism"
determines the questions we ask and the explanations
that are accepted as valid in disciplines across the life
and cognitive sciences.
We have gathered a select group of world-leading em-
pirical investigators and theoreticians from the eld
of developmental biology and evo-devo together with
modelers and philosophers of biology to discuss what
\mechanism" means, and what kind of properties the
concept should incorporate to guide productive new re-
search and the integration of developmental biology and
evolutionary theory. This integration lies at the very
heart of modern biology. Its relevance transcends the
scope of evo-devo, since an understanding of the map-
ping from genotype to phenotype through metabolism,
physiology, and development is also crucial in other
elds, such as the genetic study of complex disease, or
organismal behaviour.
This course is mainly aimed at early-stage (PhD or post-
doc) empirical and theoretical researchers with a general
background and interest in developmental and/or evolu-
tionary biology. More senior investigators are welcome
to apply as well. Exceptions can be made for motivated
masters students. Participants of previous Venice Sum-
mer Schools in Evo-Devo are expressly encouraged to
reapply as this course has an entirely dierent topic.
The course will equip participants with the conceptual
tools to engage in a productive discussion of the notionDecember 1, 2018 EvolDir 171
of \mechanism" and to relate this notion to their own
research questions and explanations.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
