Invasion Genetics: The Baker and Stebbins Legacy A
symposium at Asilomar, CA (USA) 13-15 Aug 2014
We are nearing the 50th anniversary of one of the most
important books in evolutionary biology: The Genetics
of Colonizing Species (1965) edited by Herbert Baker
and G. Ledyard Stebbins. This classic volume was
based on a symposium at Asilomar, California in 1964
and initiated the study of the genetics and evolution
of invasive species. To revisit the historical legacy of
the meeting and book, we are pleased to announce a
symposium at Asilomar from August 13-15, 2014. The
symposium will enjoy support from Wiley Blackwell
Publishers, and associated original papers will appear
in a Special Issue of Molecular Ecology in 2015. The
symposium proceedings including the popular question-
answer transcripts of the original) will also be published
in 2015 as a book to mark the 50th anniversary of theoriginal volume.

Please note the following DEADLINES:
Registration and abstract submission: 4 August, 2014
Accommodation: availability cannot be guaranteed af-
ter 28 July, 2014
The United Kingdom is home to exceptional evolution-
arybiologists. However, compared to the number of
evolutionaryzoologists, the number of their botanical
counterparts is few. In many cases, U.K. plant evo-
lutionary biologists are in small numbers at any one
institution, and such isolation hinders progress.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh will host a con-
ference on 8, 9 September, 2014 to help address this
situation. The conference will showcase evolutionary
research on plants by UK researchers to foster new col-
laborations. The conference will also hold a workshop,
where discussion will identify challenges faced and sug-gest strategies to overcome them. We see this as a
rst step towards developing a longer-terms strategy for
strengthening the UK community of plant evolutionary
biologists.
The conference will include a poster and networking
session, open speaking slots (both standard and \light-
ning" talks), as well as an exciting lineup of invited
speakers.

Guaruja Brazil SSB Jun26-30
Call for 2015 SSB Symposia
The Society for Systematic Biologists invites proposals
for symposia to be held at the 2015 SSB meeting in
Guaruja, Brazil from June 26-30, 2015. The meeting
will be held jointly with the American Society of Natu-
ralists (ASN) and the Society for the Study of Evolution
(SSE).
Proposals should include (1) a descriptive title, (2) one
or two paragraphs explaining the purpose of the sym-posium and its relevance to systematics, (3) a list of
presentations including proposed speakers, their insti-
tutions or aliations, and their presentation titles, and
(4) an indication of whether the speakers have been
invited and whether they have agreed to participate.
Symposia are restricted to half-day sessions (typically 6
half hour talks). The society is particularly interested
in symposia whose topics do not overlap with those
from previous meetings, that introduce new ideas or
synthesize important concepts, or those that are partic-
ularly good examples of the analysis of empirical data.
Proposals that unite systematics with other elds are
also desirable. We encourage participation from young
investigators and others typically under-represented in
symposia. Limited funding is available.
The deadline for full consideration is September 1,
2014. Proposals should be emailed (Word or PDF for-
mat) to the Program Chairperson, Stacey D. Smith,
Stacey.D.Smith@Colorado.edu (Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado,
Boulder, CO, 80309-0334). Please use the subject head-
ing: SSB Symposium Proposal.
The program chair will conrm receipt of submitted
proposals; please inquire if you do not receive email
conrmation. The proposals will be considered by the
SSB Council, and the two selected symposia will receive
funds to partially defer participant costs.

The United Kingdom is home to exceptional evolution-
arybiologists. However, compared to the number of
evolutionaryzoologists, the number of their botanical
counterparts is few. In many cases, U.K. plant evo-
lutionary biologists are in small numbers at any one
institution, and such isolation hinders progress.August 1, 2014 EvolDir 11
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh will host a con-
ference on 8, 9 September, 2014 to help address this
situation. The conference will showcase evolutionary
research on plants by UK researchers to foster new col-
laborations. The conference will also hold a workshop,
where discussion will identify challenges faced and sug-
gest strategies to overcome them. We see this as a
rst step towards developing a longer-terms strategy for
strengthening the UK community of plant evolutionary
biologists.
The conference will include a poster and networking
session, open speaking slots (both standard and \light-
ning" talks), as well as an exciting lineup of invited
speakers.

SanDiego PhysiologicalAdaptation
Oct5-8 Deadline
The upcoming Intersociety Meeting in Comparative
and Evolutionary Physiology, organized by the Amer-
ican Physiological Society and several sponsoring soci-
eties (Society for Experimental Biology, SICB, TCS)
will be held in San Diego, CA, October 5-8, 2014.
The Meeting Website is available at: http://www.the-
aps.org/mm/Conferences/APS-Conferences/2014-
Conferences/Comparative Funds are available to
support student and postdoc travel. Several Special
Symposia will cover a variety of topics regarding
physiological adaptation. Abstract submissions are
due July 9, 2014.In particular, Professor Guy Charmantier from Univer-
sit e Montpellier, France has organized a special sym-
posium on Physiological Adaptation from Marine to
Freshwater Environments. Invited speakers are listed
below. Abstract submissions are encouraged to be in-
cluded in this session:
Invasions of freshwater habitats by marine and brack-
ish organisms have been successfully performed by only
a few animal taxa over evolutionary time, and consti-
tute one of the major transitions in the history of life.
In addition, recent and rapid colonizations of fresh-
water areas have resulted from human activities, such
as transportation. Invading low salinity environments
confronts the animals with serious challenges for main-
taining hydromineral balance, mainly in retaining and
acquiring ions against adverse gradients, and excret-
ing excess water. Freshwater environments can also be
aected by contaminations, either natural or anthro-
pogenic. As natural selection acts on all developmental
stages, each must adapt to new conditions before in-
vasion of a novel environment, such as freshwater, can
become successful. This symposium addresses various
physiological adaptations that have enabled coloniza-
tions of fresh water from marine environments over dif-
ferent time scales. Speakers will describe physiological
adaptations at multiple hierarchical levels of biological
organization, from molecules to organisms and popu-
lations, and will discuss several model species or taxa,
mainly crustaceans and sh, at dierent stages of devel-
opment, from embryos to adults. The talks will explore
adaptive responses to challenges imposed by freshwater
environments, including the presence of contaminants.

MicrobialSymbiosisGenomics
The Burke lab in the Entomology department at the
University of Georgia is recruiting PhD students for
the Spring semester of 2015.
Research in the lab focuses upon symbiotic relation-
ships between microbes and animals, and uses func-
tional and evolutionary genetics and genomics to ex-
amine how these kinds of relationships can occur and
are maintained. In particular, we study the fascinating
benecial viruses that are harbored by parasitic wasps.
Graduate students in the lab will generally work on the
molecular genetics and genomics of microbial symbionts
of animals and are encouraged to consider projects in-
volving viral associations with parasitic wasps or other
insects.
Graduate students accepted into the Entomology pro-
gram are guaranteed nancial support for their 5-year
program through Teaching Assistantships (TAs) or Re-
search Assistantships (RAs), which includes an out-of-
state tuition waiver. Additional funding exists for grad-
uate student research and travel to scientic meetings.
Interested students are also strongly encouraged to ap-
ply for graduate research fellowships, such as the Na-
tional Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow-
ship. Importantly, students are eligible to apply for this
and other fellowships in their nal year as undergradu-
ates. Please refer to the Burke lab website for detailed
information about nancial support and the University
of Georgia graduate program in Entomology.
The University of Georgia is a Tier I research university
located in Athens, Georgia. The University of Georgia
Entomology department has strong representation of
faculty studying host/parasite relationships and vector
biology, creating a collaborative environment in which
students can benet from interaction with other fac-
ulty and students. The Burke lab has been recently
renovated and is well-equipped for molecular biology

UGlasgow Adaptation
PhD Studentship, University of Glasgow
Food security in the omics era: the role of polyploidy,
hybridisation and mating system on the ability of crops
to adapt to changing environments
An acknowledged threat to food security is the ability of
crops and livestock to respond to increased environmen-
tal variability resulting from climate change. In plants,
crops are often selected to be able to self-propagate
but this comes at a cost to genetic variation, which
could reduce potential for adaptation to changing en-
vironments. Hybridising dierent strains can increase
genetic variation and combine desirable traits from dif-
ferent species but this is often accompanied by doubling
of the genome (polyploidisation) to increase stability of
the hybrid combination. Theoretically, this should in-
crease exibility to adapt to changing conditions. How-
ever, the relative eects of such breeding strategies on
adaptability and the consequences for yield of econom-
ically important traits remain largely untested. Impor-
tantly, plants adapting to changing environments need
to be able to continue to attract benecial symbionts
(pollinators and soil microbes that enable them to pro-
cess nutrients) and to combat potentially new threats
(pathogens and herbivores) but it is not known how the
combination of mating system, ploidy and hybridisationaect such interactions. An exciting technological de-
velopment is characterisation of microbial communities
using deep sequencing approaches. The vast amounts
of data generated and the diculty of resolving species
based on short sequences means that improved meth-
ods need to be developed for characterising microbial
diversity and interpreting what this means for interact-
ing organisms.
Using a common garden approach, combined with gen-
eration and analysis of deep sequencing data, and devel-
opment of advanced statistical approaches to character-
ising biodiversity, the purpose of this multidisciplinary
project is to use economically important Brassica na-
pus (oilseed rape, which is used for both biofuel and
edible oil production and is a polyploid hybrid that re-
produces by self-fertilising) as a model to investigate:
1) the relative ability of plants with dierent traits to
adapt to new environments; 2) the role of the microbial
community in plant adaptation; 3) the consequences
of the interaction between plant tness and microbial
community diversity for oil seed yield.

EvolutionAntibioticResistance
The Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genet-
ics at the Zoological Institute of the University of Kiel
is seeking to ll a position within the research project
\Evolution of antibiotic resistance" for a
PhD student (m/f)
Deadline for applications: 15 August 2014. Start of
position: September 2014 or soon afterwards.
The position will be for three years, with possible ex-
tension. The regular weekly working hours amount to
65% of a full time position. The salary will be according
to the German TV-L-13 pay scale.
Description
Although antibiotics have only been discovered about
seventy years ago, they have saved thousands of lives
and have become an almost trivial but indispensable
cure for bacterial infections. However, the alarmingspread of resistant bacteria is complicating even the
most routine clinical interventions. Case in point are
highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which cause
almost untreatable respiratory and wound infections in
the hospital, and play a driving role in cystic bro-
sis. The discovery of new antibiotics may oer tem-
porary relief from resistance, but it is slow and costly,
and does not address the heart of the matter: resis-
tance is an evolutionary response to the use of antibi-
otics. Our research program is aimed at investigating
ways in which existing antibiotics can be intelligently
used to prevent or at least slow down the evolution
of resistance. The project will involve in vitro exper-
imental evolution using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
subsequent phenotypic, genomic and functional-genetic
analyses of resistant strains.
The project is funded by the German Science Foun-
dation (DFG) and will be based in the Department
of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics at the Univer-
sity of Kiel, Northern Germany, under the supervision
of Dr. Gunther Jansen and Prof. Hinrich Schulen-
burg (www.uni-kiel.de/zoologie/evoecogen). The de-
partment provides an international and interactive at-
mosphere, while Kiel University and connected insti-
tutes (e.g., Max Planck Institute in Ploen) oer a stim-
ulating research environment with a particular focus
on evolutionary biology. The city of Kiel is a medium-
sized pleasant town located at the coast of the Baltic
Sea. It is the capital of the most Northern state of Ger-
many, Schleswig-Holstein. It oers many opportunities
for leisure activities, including theatres, an opera, the
Schleswig-Holstein classical music festival, the world's
largest metal festival in Wacken, sailing, surng, cy-
cling, and the famous festivities of the \Kieler Woche"
| one of the major sailing events in Europe.
Requirements for the position:
Master in biology, genetics, microbiology, biochemistry
or related topic; excellent background in evolution, ge-
netics, statistics and microbiology; knowledge of basic
molecular techniques; experience with complex experi-
mental designs; high motivation; a collaborative spirit;
uency in English.
The University of Kiel strives to increase the propor-
tion of women in research and education. It therefore
encourages qualied women to apply. Women will be
preferred in cases of comparable qualications. It also
explicitly welcomes applications from people with a mi-
gratory background. The University further makes an
eort to employ disabled people and will prefer such
candidates in case of equal qualication.

PhD student position in Whole-genome sequencing and
genotyping of non-model Eukaryotes for evolutionary
biology
* Project description
New generation sequencing technologies oer exciting
new prospects for studying evolution, but also create
great challenges related to the large amount of sequence
data to be analysed in a single project. We seek a
PhD candidate that will work on developing software
pipelines for whole genome sequencing and analyse ge-
nomic variation for non model organisms, for several
evolutionary biology projects. The projects involved
concern (1) investigating adaptation of an herbivorous
insect to its host plant at the genomic level, (2) infer-
ring demographic history of various plant species from
genomic variation, and (3) identication of candidate
sex pheromones from transcriptome sequencing.
* Promotor information
The student will work at the Interuniversity In-
stitute of Bioinformatics in Brussels (IB)2 (http:/-
/ibsquare.be), located on the campus of the Uni-
versit Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), and will enrol
at both ULB, with promotor Patrick Mardulyn
(http://ebe.ulb.ac.be/) and Vrije Universiteit Brus-
sel (VUB), with promotor Tom Lenaerts (http://-
www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/tlenaert). Other co-promotors
will supervise specic aspects of the research:Olivier Hardy (ULB, http://ebe.ulb.ac.be/), Ludwig
Triest (VUB, http://www.vub.ac.be/APNA/sta/-
Triest/), Guillaume Smits (ULB, http://ibsquare.be),
and Franky Bossuyt (VUB, http://www.amphibia.be).
* Student skills
The ideal candidate has a Masters Degree with a
strong background in bioinformatics, with good pro-
gramming and statistical skills, and a good under-
standing of the processes that govern biological evo-
lution. Because the PhD candidate is expected to con-
tribute to several projects, his ability to communicate
and collaborate with others is essential. In general,
the (IB)2 is a highly collaborative environment, and
good interpersonal skills and an open attitude are ex-
pected. The candidate should also be uent in En-
glish, the main language of the institute. Note that
some language requirements (related to knowledge of
english or dutch) have to be fullled for enrolment
at the VUB (http://www.vub.ac.be/english/infofor/-
prospectivestudents/languagetest.html).
* Important note
We can only guarantee one year of funding; prospects
exist for full 4 years funding, but this will depend on
the success of project grant applications and/or on per-
sonal grant applications by the candidate. Full support
will be provided by the promotors to succeed with these
personal grant applications.
* Interested?
Please send a CV, letter of motivation, and contact in-
formation of two references to Patrick Mardulyn (pmar-
duly@ulb.ac.be). Further enquiries about the position
can be directed to the same address. The candidate
is expected to start 1st October 2014 and the position
will be lled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

Project Title
Molecular control of the development of a morpholog-
ical evolutionary novelty involved in olfactory commu-
nication, androconia, of the model buttery Bicyclus
anynana.
Available position
A fulltime four-year Ph.D. position is available at the
Biodiversity Research Centre, Earth and Life Institute,
University of Louvain-la-Neuve (UCL) in Belgium.
Description of the project
The doctoral project will be undertaken at a leading
Belgium University, in a laboratory interested in the
evolution of olfactory communication and its role in
speciation using the model buttery Bicyclus anyana.
Our group has identied the male sex pheromone in-
volved in mate choice in B. anynana and has shown that
this sex perfume is under sexual selection. Moreover,
it was shown that wide diversication of the African
Bicyclus genus is associated with selection and repro-
ductive character displacement on the composition of
the male sex pheromone between closely related sym-
patric Bicyclus species1-4. Importantly, androconia,
formed of hair-like structures located on the wings, are
the major morphological structure responsible for male
sex pheromone production in the Bicyclus genus. Yet,
despite the evolutionary recently acknowledged impor-
tance of androconia, these morphological structures are
an evolutionary novelty specic to Lepidoptera and as
such, the molecular mechanisms controlling their devel-
opment remain unknown.
In this regard, this project aims at unraveling the
molecular bases of androconia development in Bicyclus
and identies whether novel genes, or rather recycled
developmental pathways, have been used to produce
the Lepidoptera-specic androconial structures. A high
throughput 454 transcriptome data of B. anynana de-
veloping wings is available in the lab for identifying an
unbiased list of candidate genes. Moreover, B. anynana
butteries can be reared in large numbers in the lab-
oratory, allowing large-scale experiments. The project
will aim at rst to identify a list of candidate genes
in the transcriptome, and second, validate their pat-
terns of temporal and spatial expression with pheno-
typic data of androconia development, using RT-qPCR
and manipulative gene expression approaches5. The
functional characterization of the candidate genes will
be conducted in collaboration with the laboratory ofDr. P. Beldade (Gulbenkian Institute of Science, Lis-
bon, Portugal) 6-8. The research will lead to decipher-
ing the molecular bases of androconia development in
the rst Lepidoptera studied till date.
A second step of this project will aim at investigating
whether the same molecular developmental pathways
have been conserved, or not, through the diversica-
tion of the Bicyclus genus. For this we will test the
expression of our B. anynana list of candidate genes
in the development of the androconia of closely related
Bicyclus species, which numbers and positions are the
main character allowing to discriminate among closely
related species in the eld9.
Requirements
We are looking for a strongly motivated candidate with
a Masters degree in Molecular Biology or Evolutionary
Ecology, or related elds. Experience in molecular bi-
ology and written and oral communication skills in En-
glish are desirable, as is the ability to work eciently,
independently as well as in collaboration. The grant
will be delivered upon successful written application
prepared in collaboration with the selected applicant
and an oral interview in Brussels (October-November
2014), which can be done either in English or French.
Adequate training will be provided for preparing for
the interview. The selected applicant will be super-
vised throughout the process. The degrees obtained
abroad (outside Belgium) or in the Flemish Commu-
nity will require an equivalence (necessary to provide
documentation of passed examinations for 300 credits
including a research work of at least six months dur-
ing master with a scientic report; more information:
http://www.uclouvain.be/356107.html) for which the
deadline is August 11th, 2014. The candidate will be
expected to present his/her research results in national
and international conferences.
Work environment
The PhD student will work in a highly active and in-
tegrated academic environment, in the research team
of Prof. Caroline Nieberding and in close collabora-
tion with Dr. Alok Arun, as well as other postdocs
and PhD students, and will interact with members of
other research teams of the Institute. Our Univer-
sity is an Equal Opportunity/Armative Action Em-
ployer, and is in a French-speaking region, but the lan-
guage for meetings and scientic interactions is English.

UMichigan
EvolutionaryEcolPhysiology
I am looking for Ph.D. students to join my newly
formed research group in Fall 2015 in the Department of
Psychology (Biopsychology Program Area) at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ocial
start dates for these positions would be August 2015
or August 2016 but preliminary eld or lab work could
start as early as Spring 2015.
My research group focuses on addressing questions at
the interface of evolutionary ecology, behavior, and
physiology in free-living mammalian species (see http:/-
/www-personal.umich.edu/ ~ dantzer/). I am broadly
interested in understanding how wild animals are af-
fected by changes in their ecological or social environ-
ment and the behavioral and physiological mechanisms
by which they adjust themselves to these altered envi-
ronments. We address these questions using long-term
observational data as well as performing large-scale ex-
periments in the eld. We aim to couple this eld re-
search with detailed mechanistic work from hormones
to genomes.
The exact objectives of the research projects are ex-
tremely exible and will largely be determined by the
student but I hope that they will overlap with the fo-
cus of my research group. I am particularly looking for
students that are interested in blending eld and lab-
oratory research in free-living mammalian species and
have previous experience carrying out eld and/or lab
research. Students that have an interest and experience
in neuroscience or neurobiology are also encouraged to
apply.
Ph.D. students that are admitted to the Department
of Psychology at the University of Michigan are fully
funded for ve years. This support package includes
tuition (Fall & Winter), salary (including 4 years of
summer salary), and medical/dental insurance (all year
round including the summer). Two and half of the years
are fully-funded research assistant positions (no teach-
ing) whereas the other two and half years are funded by
half-time teaching assistant positions. External or Uni-
versity fellowships can also reduce teaching responsibil-
ities. Funds for research expenses will also be available.In addition to this great nancial support package, Ann
Arbor is a great place to live and work!
Applications to the Department of Psychology (http:/-
/goo.gl/Lxwd) would be due by 1 December 2014 for
the Fall 2015 start date. Admitted students would par-
ticipate in the Biopsychology Program Area in the De-
partment of Psychology (see graduate curriculum here:
http://goo.gl/6Se3fc) but would also be able to take
courses and participate informally in the Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
of Michigan (http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/).
If you are interested in applying for these Ph.D. po-
sitions, please send me an email (dantzer@umich.edu)
that contains your CV, GRE test scores (if available),
and a brief description outlining your research interests
and also why you would be interested in joining my re-
search group. I will then respond outlining what you
can expect from me as a supervisor as well as discuss
possible research projects.

Doctoral Research Fellowship in Evolutionary Ge-
nomics/Behavioural Ecology
A 4-year PhD position is available at the Natural His-August 1, 2014 EvolDir 29
tory Museum (NHM), University of Oslo (UiO). The
PhD project is part of a larger research program on
'Sperm-pathogen interactions and the evolution of ejac-
ulate antimicrobial defences in passerine birds'.
Animals are constantly exposed to pathogens, and the
ability of individuals to combat microbial attack is an
important component of tness. Sperm cells are not
immune to microbial exposure, and bacteria can cause
reductions in sperm quality and compromise male fertil-
ity. Moreover, ejaculate-borne pathogens can be trans-
ferred during mating (i.e. STDs), with negative conse-
quences for female fertility. Thus, ejaculate-borne bac-
teria are predicted to generate intense selection for the
evolution of antibacterial substances in seminal uid.
This project integrates organismal and molecular ap-
proaches to develop an understanding of the role of bac-
teria in the evolution of avian seminal uid and factors
that minimise bacterial-induced sperm defects and limit
the transmission of STDs. The successful candidate will
be allowed to focus on either the evolutionary genomics
or the behavioural ecology aspects of the larger study
(or some combination of these two) as best ts her/his
skills and research interests. She/he will also be encour-
aged to develop additional, complementary avenues of
research.
Interested candidates should have a good degree in a
relevant subject, such as background in evolutionary bi-
ology or behavioural ecology. In addition, an interest in
evolutionary genomics and previous eldwork and bird
handling experience would be advantageous. The posi-
tion is aliated with the Sex and Evolution Research
Group (SERG) at the Natural History Museum (NHM)
and the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Syn-
thesis (CEES), and may also include a period of time
based in the laboratory of Dr Steve Dorus (Syracuse
University, USA). The research team will also include
scientists from the USA and Germany. The working
language will be English. Fieldwork may be conducted
at a variety of locations, including Norway and Italy.

Description The development of new sequencing tech-
nologies brings markers for the analysis of spatial dy-
namics of species. This large data can allow to improve
signicantly models of species response to environmen-
tal changes. Current model used, based on niche the-
ory are inferred from correlation between environmen-
tal variables and species occurrences. They do not ac-
count for migration and adaptive abilities of species,
which can aect the responses. Genes are markers of
migration and adaptations. Inferring models of biodi-
versity dynamics from genomic data constitutes there-
fore a new challenge for population biology and ecology.
There is however no tool or statistical theory that in-
tegrate in a single model of inference the stochastic
(neutral model) and deterministic (niche model) pro-
cesses determining these distributions to link spatial
genetic data to environmental and connectivity vari-
ables related to geography, climate or socioecosystem.
In the agship project aiming to understand and im-
prove adaptive abilities of socioecosystems, the labex
Biodiversity, Agriculture, Society, Climate (BASC) of
Paris- Saclay, wishes to train a doctorate in the area of
integrative modeling from gene to socioecosystem. The
stochastic model is an extension from on circuit the-
ory model[1]. Inferred parameters concern both mech-
anisms of connectivity and response to environment.
The task will consist in taking charge in collaboration
of the development of an inference tool of environmen-
tal demogenetic models and to exploit several data sets.
The project has three stages.30 EvolDir August 1, 2014
I - Finalization of the development of an inference
tool assuming a non changing environment. And val-
orization of the tool on several genetic - environmental
data sets on BASC insect, plant and plant pathogens
datasets.
II - The development of an inference tool that takes
into account spatial heterogeneity.
III - The construction of scenario for species response to
environmental changes and the evaluation of ecosystem
services or disservices provided by some practices or
country planning, bsed on the software SIMADAPT[2].

Research Assistant/Associate in Genomic Microbiology
at Imperial College London
This position has become available within the MRC
Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Impe-
rial College London. The MRC Centre has built upon a
world-leading research group in the Department of In-
fectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College Lon-
don to undertake applied collaborative work with na-
tional and international agencies in support of policy
planning for emerging and endemic infectious diseases.
The successful candidate will be a member of both the
Centre and the Department, and will be based at the
St Mary's Campus, Paddington.
The purpose of this post is to develop statistical and
computational methods to perform genome-wide as-
sociation mapping in bacteria. Important biomedical
properties often vary within a bacterial species, for ex-
ample antibiotic resistance, virulence, host-specicity
or tissue-specicity. The genetic basis for these varia-
tions is not often fully understood by microbiologists,
but this question can be approached computationally
by comparing the genome sequences of bacteria with
dierent properties. Working closely with Dr Xavier
Didelot, the post-holder will develop the methodology
required to perform such analysis and create a new
software tool which will be applicable by microbial re-
searchers around the world. To be valid, the new meth-
ods will need to account for the specicity of bacterial
evolutionary process, especially in terms of recombina-
tion, genetic content and population structure. Thor-
ough testing of the software will be performed using
simulated datasets, as well as real existing collections36 EvolDir August 1, 2014

Final Call to Apply for the Tree-for-All: A hackathon
to access OpenTree's global phylogeny resources.
A global 'tree of life' will transform biological research
in a broad range of disciplines from ecology to bio-
engineering. To help facilitate that transformation,
the OpenTree <http://opentreeoife.org/ >project
[1] now provides online access to >4000 published phy-
logenies, and a newly generated tree covering more than
2.5 million species.
The next step is to build tools to enable the commu-
nity to use these resources. To meet this aim, OpenTree
<http://www.opentreeoife.org/ >, Arbor <http://-
www.arborworkows.com/ >[2] and NESCent's HIP <
http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP >working groups [3]
are staging a week-long hackathon September 15 to 19
at U. Michigan, Ann Arbor. Participants in this 'Tree-
for-all' will work in small teams to develop tools that
use OpenTree's web services to extract, annotate, or
add data in ways useful to the community. Teams also
may focus on testing, expanding and documenting the
web services.
How could a global phylogeny be useful in your research
or teaching? What other data from OpenTree would be
valuable? How could OpenTree web services be inte-
grated into familiar workows and analysis tools? How
could we add to the database of published trees, or en-
rich it with annotations?
If you can imagine using these resources, and you have
the skills to work collaboratively to turn those ideas
into products (as a coder, or working side-by-side with
coders), we invite you to apply for the hackathon. The
full call for participation (http://bit.ly/1ioPPMc) pro-
vides instructions for how to apply, and how to share
your ideas with potential teammates (strongly encour-
aged prior to applying). Applications are due July 8th.
Travel support is provided. Women and underrepre-
sented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
If you have questions, contact Karen Cranston
(karen.cranston@nescent.org, @kcranstn, Open-
Tree), Arlin Stoltzfus (arlin@umd.edu, HIP), Julie
Allen ( juliema@illinois.edu, HIP), or Luke Harmon

BOWERBIRD SIGNAL FUNCTION AND EVOLU-
TION: VOLUNTEER (unpaid) eld research assistant
needed October-December 2014
I am looking for an experienced female eld worker to
help my female Ph.D. student doing eld work on Great
Bowerbirds, approximate dates October through to mid
December 2014. (Female because the eld house oers
little privacy). Ideally the volunteer should have exten-
sive experience with birds. The volunteer should also
know how to drive a 4WD vehicle in easy to moderate
conditions (we almost never have to shift into 4WD)
and not mind living in eldwork conditions.
Duties generally involve helping to drive to bower sites,
walking between bowers (up to 4km), carrying equip-
ment and helping to check/maintain the camera equip-
ment at bowers on a regular basis, as well as the initial
set up and nal taking down of the camera systems,
solar panels and batteries used to run the cameras.
Other duties will include sound recording, backing up
video onto USB disk drives, some analysis of the video
recordings collected, and helping to do two object pre-
sentation experiments.
This eld work takes place on a remote cattle station
(Ranch in North American parlance) in Queensland, so
it is hot and dry. This will involve a fair amount of
walking in these conditions so the volunteer should be
reasonably t. Transportation will be provided to/from
the eld station from Townsville (the nearest airport).
The successful applicant will have to share a simple
house with the PhD student and help with the day to
day aspects of eldwork as well as cooking and keeping
the house tidy. This cattle station is full of wildlife (the
owners really know how to care for the land) so expect
to see lots of kangaroos, emus and bustards, among
other animals. It is well into the outback so internet
connections are weak and absent in some days; this is
not something a city-type would enjoy.

Career survey
Dear colleagues, Id be grateful if you could please help
me spread the call for a short survey below, as well as
take it yourself. Kind regards, rob
Moving countries early on in the academic career of
ecologists and evolutionary biologists seems to have be-
come a common practice' but at what costs? and for
what benets? To address these questions, a survey has
been created for ecologists and evolutionary biologists.
The survey contains 24 short questions, and it will take
you approx. 4 mins, should you decide to take it.
http://tinyurl.com/ov7oh56 This project aims to
quantify the frequency with which early-career ecolo-
gists and evolutionary biologist move countries com-
pared to more senior individuals, as well as the per-
ceived benets and costs of doing so. This is a com-
pletely voluntary survey, and no personal information
(e.g. email, ID) will be collected. The information col-
lected will be used to provide summary statistics on
early career moves for a short note to be submitted to
a peer-review journal.
Many thanks for considering and disseminating it!

DavidStarrJordan Prize
The David Starr Jordan Prize For Innovative Contri-
butions to the Study of Evolution, Ecology, Population
and Organismal Biology
In 1986, Cornell, Indiana and Stanford Universities es-
tablished a joint endowment to fund a prize in honor
of David Starr Jordan, a scientist, educator and insti-
tution builder, who had enormous inuence on higher
education in the United States and important ties to
each of these universities. The prize is international in
scope and presented approximately every three years to
a young scientist (not over the age of 40 at the deadline
for nomination, or if over 40, less than 10 years since
receiving the Ph.D.).
The intent of this prize is to recognize young scientists
who are making novel innovative contributions in one
or more areas of Jordan's interest: evolution, ecology,
population and organismal biology, and who are likely
to redirect the principal foci of their elds. In addi-
tion to a $20,000 cash award, the recipient will receive
a commemorative medal, will attend an awards cere-
mony, visit each of the sponsoring institutions and give
scholarly presentations of his/her work. The selection
of the prize winner will be made by a committee com-
posed of representatives from each of the three institu-
tions. This year the award ceremony will be held at
Indiana University.
Nominations forms are posted on the David Starr Jor-
dan Prize Website (www.davidstarrjordan.org). Nomi-
nation forms with supporting materials should be sub-
mitted electronically. Questions should be directed to:

DNA extraction suggestions
Dear members
I am a PhD student working on population genomics of
freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis. I am trying to
extract high quality, high molecular weight DNA ( ~3ug,
>50kb); from Paratya for RAD-sequencing. I have
tried dierent extraction methods on fresh and frozen
samples so far, e.g. Spin-Column extraction, CTAB
extraction and Salt extraction. Besides, I have also
tried an extended gDNA extraction procedure by incor-
porating a salting out step prior to phenol/chloroform
cleanup. But unfortunately these methods have all pro-
duced what appears to be a smear of degraded DNA
rather than high molecular weight band on agarose
gels. Can anyone suggest me any other procedures that
might help?
Thanks.

Landscape Genetics Datasets
Dear EvolDir community,
I am writing to you in support of a collaborative
research project that I am participating in through
the Landscape Genetics Distributed Graduate Seminar
(DGS). The DGS is an interdisciplinary course that em-
ploys Internet-based lectures, laboratories at home in-
stitutions, and group projects involving graduate stu-
dents and faculty mentors from several continents to
teach landscape genetics techniques. Within the group
projects, we work collaboratively with students across
several universities to develop important research ques-
tions, with the goal of publishing a peer-reviewed arti-
cle.
Our study, which I am writing to you about on behalf of
my group, is seeking to conduct a review of landscape-
wide eects of fragmentation by roads on genetic di-
versity and structure. Our aim is to characterize these
eects across numerous plant and animal taxa in North
America and Europe. As a group, we are currently re-
viewing several publications that assess genetic diver-
sity and genetic structure of individuals and/or popu-
lations.
Accordingly, this is a request for datasets that we canAugust 1, 2014 EvolDir 57
include in our analysis. All datasets will be cited and
we will keep contributing authors aware of the progres-
sion of our work. Specically, we are seeking to identify
datasets containing (a) raw genotypic data of sampled
individuals and/or populations; and (b) associated spa-
tial coordinates of the sampled individuals and/or pop-
ulations.
If you or any colleagues have such datasets and are
willing to share them with us, please contact Charlotte
Gabrielsen by email (cgabrie2@uwyo.edu). I will be
happy to provide any additional information or answer
any questions you may have regarding our project.
In the meantime, thank you in advance for your time
and support of our project!

Museum Otter DNA
Dear EvolDir Members:
I would like entering in contact with someone who is
working on ancient DNA from museum otters (any of
the 13 living species). I am working with Lutrogale
perspicillata (smooth-coated otter) museum samples,
mostly toe pads (foot pads). But in some cases I also
used \skin" fragments from skull (i.e. turbinal bones).
I am facing with much more diculties with respect to
the work on toe pads from museum galliforms, and I am
starting to think that toe pads in otters are not source
of aDNA as good as skin fragments from skull (or toe
pads in galliforms). Although I am aware that general-
isations are quite hard in this eld, might this depend
on the fact that when these animals die this may occur
in water (or on the fact they spend a lot of time in the
water)? Any opinion in this respect? Any suggestions?
Thank you,

Seeking PlantEvolution Book
Dear All:
I'm teaching a small graduate course this fall on the
semi-unique ways that plants evolve compared to ver-
tebrates and many diocieous animals that make up the
core of many evolution textbooks.
The most current one that I know \ Verne Grant's Plant
Speciation. Second edition. is woefully outdated.
Yes, I'll have the students read reviews and other arti-
cles, but I would really appreciate it if someone could
recommend a book that can help them hit the ground
running BEFORE reading one of those papers. Some-
thing that can cover allopolyploidy, permanent translo-
cation heterozygosity, mobile elements, mixed mating
systems, the various methods of plant asexuality, ane-
uploidy, plasticity, heterostyly, etc.
Please respond directly to me: ellstrand@ucr.edu
Thanks in advance!

CapeVerdeWarbler
Hi,
I am a PhD student at the University of East Anglia
working on a PhD project about population dierenti-
ation in the Cape Verde warbler. This project aims to
assess dierences in ecology, morphology and genetics
between the remaining populations of the Cape Verde
warbler. We conducted a eld season last year withthe aim of collecting samples for genetic analysis. This
year, we plan to characterize habitat features and insect
abundance, conduct population censuses, record bird
sound, ring birds and possibly collect blood and faecal
samples. Work will be conducted on Santo Ant~ ao, S.
Nicolau, Fogo and Santiago.
We are seeking a eld assistant for three months
(September-December 2014). Accommodation, food
and local transportation will be provided, but the vol-
unteer will have to pay for his/her own ight to Cape
Verde. Experience in bird, insect or habitat surveying,
or bird ringing desired, We mostly seek an adventur-
ous and exible eld assistant, as protocol adjustments
and schedule changes are likely to happen, and living
conditions are not always comfortable. There is an op-
portunity to develop a MSc project, for example on how
bird song diers across populations.

PrairiePopulations
Field Assistants Required IMMEDIATELY- Black-
tailed prairie dogs Grasslands National Park,
Saskatchewan, Canada
We are looking for 1-2 volunteers to assist with eld-
work beginning ASAP and continuing until Aug 31
or Oct 10 (preference will be given to those who can
stay for the full duration). The project investigates
the ecology of Black-tailed prairie dogs and will involve
live-trapping, handling and monitoring of individuals.
Prairie dog towns are home to (among others): bur-
rowing owls, swift fox and, the recently reintroduced,60 EvolDir August 1, 2014
black-footed ferret. Assistants will have the opportu-
nity of seeing all of these iconic grassland species, plus
the many more resident in the Park. This is an ex-
cellent opportunity to gain experience working with a
population of wild mammals in a spectacular setting.
All eldwork is carried out in Grasslands National Park,
southern Saskatchewan, one of the largest remaining
tracts of native prairie in Canada. We will be stay-
ing in Parks Canada housing in the heart of the Park.
Food and accommodation are provided. Volunteers are
required to provide for their own travel to Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan. Travel between the eld station and
Saskatoon is provided. Training will be provided and no
experience is necessary, but candidates should have an
interest in the following (the more the better!): ecology,
evolutionary biology, wildlife, eld biology, and animal
behaviour. The eld house and study population is iso-
lated and, as such, successful applicants need to be able
to cope under these conditions, enjoy the outdoors, be
up-beat, positive, responsible and work well as a mem-
ber of a team.
If you wish to apply for one of these posts then please
send a CV with a cover letter and contact details for
three references (with e-mail addresses), by email to

Video recordings Evolution2014About 100 people generously volunteered to let their
talks be recorded at the recent Evolution 2014 confer-
ence in Raleigh, NC, in June, and approximately 80
talks were successfully recorded ( ~10% of the total pre-
sented at the meeting). These were recorded via smart-
phones as part of an experimental program, so the qual-
ity is somewhat variable, but the majority are clear (i.e.,
slides easily readable). This eort was sponsored by the
Society for the Study of Evolution and executed by a
team of student volunteers.

experimental program, we appreciate the eorts of
everyone who made these videos possible, and we
apologize to the minority of speakers either who
wanted but didn't get their talks recorded or whose
slides are not (easily) readable. We hope the commu-
nity appreciates the accessibility these videos bring
to exciting scientic results, and that these videos
encourage people to attend one of the future Evolution

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Comparative & Population
Genomics of the Pearl Mullet
A postdoctoral position is available immediately at the
Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics Group
<http://donut.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/ >in Bilkent Uni-
versity, Ankara, Turkey, joint with the Compar-
ative & Evolutionary Biology Group <http://-
compevo.bio.metu.edu.tr/ >at METU, Ankara.
The successful candidate will be responsible for leading
a project that involves de novo assembly and compara-
tive analysis of the pearl mullet (Chalcalburnus tarichi)
genome. This is a sh endemic to Lake Van of eastern
Turkey, and one of few known examples of adaptation
to extremely alkaline (pH 9.8) water.
The goal will be to determine the genetics of alka-
line adaptation by comparative genomic, population ge-
nomic and transcriptome analyses. Another question tobe answered will be the population structure and de-
mographic history of the pearl mullet, which recently
underwent a severe bottleneck.
The project will include the following steps: - De novo
assembly and the annotation of the pearl mullet genome
using both Illumina and Pacic Biosciences data. -
Comparative genomics analysis to understand the evo-
lution of the Cyprinidae family and adaptive evolu-
tion of the pearl mullet. - Transcriptome analysis for
genome annotation; identication of gene expression
networks underlying adaptation to alkaline water. -
Population genomics analysis of samples from dierent
sections of the lake to understand the pearl mullet's mi-
gration and breeding patterns and population history.
Further details can be found in our lab web page at:
http://donut.cs.bilkent.edu.tr Requirements: - Ph.D.
degree in bioinformatics, genomics, computer science,
or related elds. Ph.D. candidates who expect to grad-
uate soon are welcome to apply. - Experience in genome
assembly and annotation is strongly preferred. - Expe-
rience in evolutionary genetics, population genomics, or
transcriptome analysis is a plus. - Strong programming
skills in at least one high level programming language;
such as C, C++, Java, or Python.
A competitive salary and subsidized on-campus accom-62 EvolDir August 1, 2014
modation will be provided. The successful candidate
will also be encouraged to apply for the TTAK 2232 (for
Turkish candidates) and the Co-Funded Brain Circula-
tion Scheme fellowship programs (all candidates; gross
monthly salary 4,167; deadline September 19, 2014;

PlantMolecularEvolution
The Sloan Lab in the Department of Biology at Col-
orado State University has an opportunity for a post-
doctoral researcher with experience in plant molecu-
lar genetics and biochemistry to lead a 3-year NSF-
funded study on cytonuclear co-evolution. Our group
focuses on molecular and genome evolution, using a
combination of wet-lab and bioinformatic techniques.
We are working with owering plants (a group that
exhibits enormous natural variation in mitochondrial
mutation rates) to study how rates of evolution in or-
ganelle genomes can drive compensatory evolution in
the nucleus. We are particularly interested in individu-
als with wet-lab expertise in plant molecular biology to
complement our group's existing strengths in molecular
evolution and computational genomics.
Desirable experience/interests include..
- Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants
(particularly Arabidopsis)
- Biochemical assays of mitochondrial function such as
OXPHOS enzyme activity
- Assays of subcellular/organellar protein targeting
- Broad intellectual interests and enthusiasm for ad-
dressing evolutionary questions
- Motivation and ideas for seeking independent post-
doctoral fellowship fundingAugust 1, 2014 EvolDir 63
- A strong motivation to foster and contribute to a fun,
positive, intellectual, and collaborative research envi-
ronment
Our lab makes extensive use of deep DNA sequencing
technologies, so there will be opportunities to gain ex-
perience and training with large NGS datasets. Previ-
ous bioinformatic experience is always helpful but not
essential.
The CSU Department of Biology has strengths in plant

EvolutionaryGenomicsSpeciation
Postdoctoral position in evolutionary genomics and
speciation.
P.I.: Dr. Kerry Shaw, Cornell University
Research Project: A postdoctoral position is available
to join an NSF-funded project in the laboratory of
Kerry Shaw at Cornell University to study the evo-
lution and genetics of traits involved in reproductive
incompatibility and speciation in the Hawaiian cricket
genus Laupala. Laupala species are recently divergedand ecologically and morphologically similar, but dier
in traits involved in sexual isolation. Behavioral evolu-
tion involving these traits is thought to have played a
large role in the rapid and extensive diversication of
this genus. The genetic basis of acoustic variation will
be studied using genomic approaches. A draft genome
is available, and we seek to improve it as a means for
identifying the genetic architecture of phenotypes in-
volved in speciation.
Requirements: The desired candidate will possess an in-
terest in / experience with molecular tools, quantitative
genetics, next gen sequencing, and associated statisti-
cal analyses (e.g. R/QTL). Bioinformatics skills (such
as basic Linux knowledge, read mapping SNP calling)
is desirable, and an interest in acquiring these skills is
essential. Basic scripting skills (Perl, Python, Ruby) is
a plus. An interest in the evolution of premating iso-
lation is also benecial, but no prior knowledge in this
area is required.
Cornell University has many labs and research groups
dedicated to the study of evolution, genomics and be-
havior and ecology of speciation as well as bioinformat-
ics. As such, it provides a rich academic environment
for those interested in evolutionary genomics and spe-
ciation.
To apply, email a statement of research interests, a cur-
riculum vitae, and the email addresses of three refer-
ences to Kerry Shaw (KLS4@cornell.edu). At least two
years of funding are available.

metabarcoding
Postdoc on e-DNA metabarcoding
The Natural History Museum of Denmark is oering
a 2-year postdoctoral position on e-DNA metabarcod-
ing commencing October 1st 2014 or soon thereafter in
the Rnsted group, Section for Evolutionary Genomics.
The application deadline is August 1st 2014.
A major outstanding question in natural science is
the inuence of the environment on the expression of
chemical defence compounds. With the advent of high
throughput Next Generation Sequencing data, it is now
possible to use eDNA Metabarcoding to provide an es-
timate of biodiversity in for example an environmental
soil sample. These new promising approaches can po-
tentially provide an easy, more accurate and relevant
estimate of the biotic assemblages present in the lo-
cal environment than traditional habitat description or
environmental analysis focusing on morphology, physi-
cal and chemical parameters. The strategic aim of this
postdoctoral research project is to develop a model for
using eDNA Metabarcoding to express local biotic pres-
sure and to use this model to test the inuence of the
biotic pressure on expression of plant chemical defence
compounds. The position will include some eldwork.
The successful candidate will become an integrated
part of the highly international research group of Nina
Rnsted and the Section of Evolutionary Genomics at
the Natural History Museum of Denmark. The Rnsted
group explores the evolution of plants and the corre-
lation between phylogeny, biological interactions and
natural products, to explain patterns and processes
of diversity. The position will include collaboration
with ongoing research projects in the group and ben-
et from association with the MedPlant ITN network,www.MedPlant.eu .The position is funded by a grant
from the VILLUM FONDEN. The starting salary is
currently up to DKK 403,682 including annual supple-
ment (+ pension up to DKK 69,030 annual).
Qualications and eligibility Applicants should hold a
PhD degree in biology or another discipline of relevance
for the research project. Experience with next gen-
eration sequencing, preferably with e-DNA metabar-
coding, including both relevant labwork experience and
bioinformatics, excellent English skills, and good inter-
personal skills, is a requirement. The main criterion
for selection will be the research potential of the ap-
plicant as reected in publications, relevant research
experience, and the letter of motivation.
At the time of recruitment, it is a requirement that the
candidate has a maximum of 3 years PhD experience.
Mobility is required and the position cannot be used
to extend existing contracts or recruit researchers with
a PhD degree from the University of Copenhagen, un-
less the candidate has worked at another institution for
minimum a year.

tribute to the identication of genes, genetic changes,
and epistatic interactions modulating sex determina-
tion or gastrointestinal biology.

including genetic mapping, gene expression analysis,
high-throughput sequencing, comparative genomics,
bioinformatics, eldwork, and evolutionary, develop-
mental, and molecular biology. An ideal candidate will

Postdoc position in eco-evolutionary theory
A postdoc position is available to work with PI Joanna

ulation genetics (based on Desai & Fisher 2007). This
model will be modied so that genotypes specify abso-
lute tness in a deteriorating environment, rather than
relative tness as is the norm in population genetics.
The project is part of a broader eort to integrate the
ecological density-dependence terms r and K with the
classical population genetics tness term of w, as part of

UArizona EvolvabilityTheory
Postdoc position in the theory of molecular errors and
evolvability
A postdoc position is available to work with Joanna
Masel (http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at
the University of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist
destination surrounded on all four sides by mountain-
ous national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city
of nearly a million people with an attractive climate.
The EEB department in Tucson was ranked in the top
10 by US News & World Report.
All molecular processes, from transcription to protein
interactions, are subject to errors. We are interested in
exploring the evolutionary consequences of this simple
fact. In previous work (Rajon & Masel 2011 PNAS), we
found that the evolution of error rates is bistable. One
attractor represents a global proofreading solution that
avoids making errors at many loci at once, the other a
local robustness solution, where errors happen at high
rates but the consequences of each error have evolved,
one locus at a time, to be benign. Populations that
evolved the local solution were much more evolvable,
with selection acting on the consequences of errors act-
ing as a playground to explore and prescreen possible
future mutations.
We are looking for a postdoc to extend this model to the
case where there is variation in expression levels among
loci. In this case, preliminary results suggest that bista-
bility no longer occurs. The postdoc will study evolv-
ability phenomena in this case, and also investigate con-
troversial hypotheses surrounding the adaptive evolu-tion of evolvability.
A strong quantitative background, good programming
skills, and previous modeling experience are all re-
quired. A background in evolutionary theory is strongly
preferred. Some interest in the molecular biology of
transcription, translation, protein folding and binding,
and the errors in each of these processes is an advan-
tage. The position is available immediately, and is re-
newable, with funding secured for at least two years.

A 3-year postdoctoral research position is available to
investigate the */Molecular and cellular mechanisms of
hyper-resistance to stress in the ameiotic bdelloid ro-
tifer /Adineta vaga. *The research will be conducted
in the group of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular
Genetics of Micro-organisms at the Catholic University
of Louvain (UCL, Belgium) to take part in a collabora-
tive ARC research program with the Research Units in
Environmental and Evolutionary Biology (URBE) and
in Cellular Biology (URBC) at the University of NamurAugust 1, 2014 EvolDir 81
(UNamur, Belgium).
This postdoc position is embedded within the research
project entitled: /Asexuality and 'immortality', bdel-
loid rotifers as an evolutionary 'scandal' and a model
system in biology. /This project is funded during 5
years and will start in October 2014.
* PIs of the project:*
*Prof. Bernard Hallet (ISV, UCL), Prof. Karine Van
Doninck (URBE, UNamur), *Dr. Florence Debacq-
Chainiaux (URBC, UNamur)**
The involved consortium brings together experts in
the elds of evolutionary biology and genomics of
bdelloid rotifers (K. Van Doninck, URBE, UNamur),
DNA recombination and genome plasticity (B. Hallet,
ISV, UC) and oxidative stress response (F. Debacq-
Chainiaux, URBC, UNamur). The appointed candi-
date will be expected to share its research time on both
sites under the supervision of the three PIs of the con-
sortium. The universities are at a distance of 35km
from each other and easily connected by train.
*Project:*
Bdelloid rotifers are micro-organisms (animals) that
have recently attracted much interest in the scientic
community because of their ancient asexuality and their
extreme resistance to stress, such as desiccation and
high doses of ionizing radiation. They are capable
to survive when their genome is shattered into small
fragments and repair the DNA double strands breaks
(DSBs) *(see Hespeels et al., JEB 2014)*. Repeated
cycles of chromosomal repair are thought to promote al-
lelic recombination and gene conversion in the absence
of meiosis. Moreover desiccation and the induced DNA
DSBs are also thought to provide a unique opportu-
nity to acquire horizontally transferred genes, thereby
contributing to the adaptive success of these organisms.
In this project, the mechanisms that make bdelloid
rotifers unique in terms of evolutionary strategy and
hyper-resistance to stress will be investigated based on
genomic data recently obtained by our consortium for
the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga/ headed by Prof.
Karine Van Doninck (*see Flot et al, 2013, Nature
500:453-7*). Genomic approaches will be used to study
the dynamics of /A. vaga/ genome during cycles of
desiccation/rehydration/radiationand to decipher the
genetic expression program that governs the dier-
ent stages of its life-style. Molecular and cellular ap-
proaches will be developed to unveil and characterize
the mechanisms that allow /A. vaga/ to repair its shat-
tered chromosomes and generate genetic diversity,as
well as its dependence with respect to oxidative stress
response. The ultimate prospect of the project is to es-tablish bdelloid rotifers as a new model system for the
understanding of fundamental biological processes such
as DNA repair, cell survival and senescence.

UFlorida EvolutionEpigenetics 2
A postdoctoral position (duration two years at least) is
available in Connie Mulligan's lab at the University of
Florida.
Two NSF-funded projects are currently ongoing and
the successful candidate can work on one or both:
1) Examination of DNA methylation patterns in moth-
ers and newborns from the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) to test whether epigenetic alterations
mediate the eects of maternal exposure to stressors
on fetal development and neonatal health. Specically,
we are testing if epigenetic modications may mediate
changes in gene expression in infants or mothers that
result from maternal trauma and material deprivation
associated with the war in the DRC. More broadly, we
are interested in the idea that behavior and complex
phenotypes may be shaped by early life experiences that
alter gene expression through epigenetic alterations.
2) Investigation of the genetic and cultural underpin-
nings of complex diseases that exhibit racial inequal-
ities, using hypertension in African-Americans as a
model phenotype. We are combining the analysis of
genome-wide SNPs, genetic ancestry estimates, andAugust 1, 2014 EvolDir 85
epigenetic variation with sociocultural data including
experience of discrimination and social network analy-
sis. By combining genetic and socio-cultural data, our
goal is a more comprehensive investigation of complex
disease and racial disparities than is possible with only
one type of data.
Qualications: A PhD and a strong background in gen-
eration of genetic data (microarray analysis, NGS, py-
rosequencing, etc.) and data analysis (gene associa-
tion analysis, regression analysis, genetic ancestry es-
timation, linkage analysis, etc) are essential. Experi-
ence generating methylation data or additional compu-
tational experience (e.g. C++,Python, R, simulation
analysis, etc) is a plus. In addition to the projects
listed above, there are excellent opportunities for the
successful candidate to develop new lines of research as
well as productive collaborations outside the lab.
The University of Florida is a leading research in-
stitution with a university-wide commitment to ge-
netics research. The Department of Anthropology
(www.anthro.u.edu) has 30 full-time faculty with di-
verse interests and a very strong biological subeld,
with emphases on molecular, paleo, and forensic an-
thropology. The department is one of the top rated
programs in the country (6th among public institutions,
11th overall). The University of Florida Genetics Insti-
tute (www.ufgi.u.edu) is an inter-college entity with
a new research building intended to enhance opportu-
nities for collaboration. Gainesville is located in north
central Florida (away from the hurricanes!), with aver-
age temperatures ranging from 45F to 90F. Beaches on
the gulf and Atlantic coast are ~11
2hours away.
To apply: via email, send a CV, a statement of re-
search interests, and the names and contact informa-
tion (including email and phone) for three references.
Applications should be sent by July 30, 2014 to cmul-
ligan@u.edu.
Review of materials will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is lled. Start date is ex-
ible and can start as early as August, 2014. Salary is
commensurate with experience. Position may be ex-
tended for a total of three years. Informal inquiries
prior to submitting a formal application are welcome.

UFlorida RNAiEvolution
We are looking for a talented, creative postdoc to help
head up a 3-year NSF-funded project examining the
molecular-functional-structural evolution of RNA inter-
ference (RNAi) in animals and plants.
We are particularly interested in understanding how di-
versication of key proteins in the RNAi system pro-
duced the molecular-systems complexity necessary to
support multicellularity in these two lineages. By com-
paring independent expansions of RNAi in animal and
plant lineages, we expect to be able to begin under-
standing the extent to which plant and animal RNAi
are functionally and structurally convergent. Our aim
is to go beyond a catalog of molecular-functional evo-
lution to begin guring out the general principles by
which molecular systems evolve and contribute to or-
ganism complexity.
We use a variety of computational, in-vitro and cell-
culture techniques to understand the evolution of
molecular function, including ancestral protein resur-
rection, molecular dynamics simulations, binding kinet-
ics experiments, and gene expression in human cells.
We are open to and encourage the development of new
methodologies for addressing these questions.
Our lab has a general interest in comparative innate an-
tiviral immunity and supports a variety of researchers
working on related projects. We are generally a hard-
working, relaxed group that enjoys creative, rigorous
and innovative science in a cordial atmosphere fueled
by lots of good coee.

UHawaii Hilo Bioinformatics 2
Just a quick reminder regarding this position. If you are
considering applying please send in your application by
1 August
*****
Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioinformatics/Evolutionary
Genetics to examine short- and long-term organismal
response to environmental change
We are looking for a motivated bioinformaticist to join
the CREST team at the University of Hawaii Hilo.
CREST is a 5-year NSF-funded project (July 2014 -
June 2019; see project overview below). Hawaii is world
renowned as an ideal setting for evolutionary studies,
and Hilo and the Big Island boast exceptional cultural
and natural diversity and a high standard of living.
This is an exciting opportunity to work with a di-
verse team of researchers working collaboratively on
the common theme of organismal response to environ-
mental change. The successful candidate will join a
team of 9 faculty, 3 technicians, and several gradu-
ate students studying the short-term (stress response)
and long-term (adaptation) responses of a broad range
of terrestrial and marine organisms to environmental
change, broadly dened.
The postdoc will provide expertise in the application of
bioinformatics analyses and will work alongside project
personnel and collaborating bioinformaticists on cam-
pus and at outside institutions on the analysis of ge-
nomics and transcriptomics data to meet project goals.
Responsibilities will include: collaborating in the de-
sign of experiments and analysis of data from next-
generation sequencing instruments, including RNA-
Sequencing, SNP, and full-genome sequencing data; as-
sisting in the management of genomic data and associ-
ated phenotypic trait data on various local data storage
systems; and preparation of manuscripts, reports and
presentations.
CREST Project Overview: The overarching theme of
this project is Understanding Biotic Response to Envi-
ronmental Change in Tropical Ecosystems Through a
Place-Based Context. This CREST:TCBES proposal
focuses on three synergistic research themes: 1) Or-
ganismal Response to Environmental Change (OREC):
While local adaptation along environmental gradients
and tracking of changing environments involve short-term acclimation and longer term evolution, it is not
known if organisms are responding to average environ-
mental conditions or to the extreme conditions expe-
rienced in their habitats. The OREC team will ex-
amine the short- and long-term responses of key or-
ganisms to a range of environmental conditions, both
steady and uctuating, and will incorporate those re-
sults into models of landscape-level response to climate
change. 2) Behavioral Responses to Environmental
Change (BREC): Behaviors central to the survival and
reproductive success of animals have evolved through
natural and sexual selection in a far dierent ecological
environment than exists today. The BREC team will
use emerging genetic and acoustic tools to examine the
eect of anthropogenic change on important social be-
haviors in animals ranging from arthropods to whales.
3) Dynamic Interactions between Symbioses and En-
vironment (DISE): Macro-organisms live in symbiosis
with a community of microorganisms; these symbiotic
relationships can shift in response to environmental
changes. The DISE team will explore adaptations of the
mutualism-pathogenesis-parasitism continuum in mul-
tiple symbiotic systems. Integration of next-generation
DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis in each of
the research areas
will allow unprecedented insight into the molecular ba-
sis of biotic responses to environmental change.
As teaching experience is an important component of
the postdoctoral experience, the postdoc will also be
encouraged to teach one course or workshop per year
at UH Hilo at the graduate** or undergraduate level in
his/her area of expertise.
**Tropical Conservation Biology and Environmental
Science Graduate Program
http://tcbes.uhh.hawaii.edu/ The position is for one
year, renewable.
The successful candidate will be a self-starter and
creative problem solver with strong communication
and interpersonal skills. Minimum qualications:
PhD involving bioinformatics analysis on an evolu-
tionary problem, experience with genomic techniques
and bioinformatics analysis. Desired qualications:
software development and implementation for multi-
dimensional data from genome sequencing, gene expres-
sion and SNP genotyping between species, populations
and experimental treatments, mathematical modeling
of population genetic processes.

ulation genomic studies in great tits (/Parus major/).
Questions of interest include examining how demog-
raphy and natural selection shape patterns of diver-
sity across the genome and understanding what evo-
lutionary forces have acted on loci that underlie phe-
notypic variation, by using existing methods and de-
veloping new methods. The project involves whole-
genome sequencing of multiple great tit individuals us-
ing high-throughput sequencing instruments, and the
subsequent bioinformatic/population genetic analysis
of the data. Therefore, demonstrable expertise in pop-

*\The quantitative genetic architecture of adaptation
in a wild plant population"*
Research Grant Holder: Benoit Pujol (CNRS)
This is a 23 months research project funded by the
University of Toulouse Excellence Initiative Projects
(IDEX UNITI). Note that the initial appointment
would be for one year, it would be renewable upto 11
further months. The position can start as early as mid
November 2014. The monthly salary is approximately
2000 euros and includes social security (French public
welfare system). French is not mandatory.
The successful candidate will assist with the evolution-
ary quantitative genetics analysis of a wild population
of Snapdragon plants (/Antirrhinum majus/) in South-
ern France. The aim of this project is to evaluate
the adaptive potential of this fragmented population
which is surveyed since 2010 (5 year data set;/n/ ~2000
plants). This project will produce a rigorous frame-
work for evaluating the contribution of environmental
and genetic factors to the tness of plants in the wild.
A suite of microsatellite markers will be used to de-
duce the relationships of individuals in the population
(Additional genotyping will be carried out by technical
sta in Toulouse and is therefore not a requirement of
the postdoc). There will be scope for collaboration on
other projects underway in the group. The postdoc will
participate to eld work. This project oer opportuni-
ties for further international collaborations, high prole
publications and career development.

*Postdoctoral Fellowship*
*Plant-Animal Interactions*
*Plant-Animal Interactions*: The Dearing lab at the
University of Utah invites applications for a postdoc-
toral fellow to participate in a study to understand the
co-evolution of mammalian herbivores and plant defen-
sive compounds. This collaborative project will inves-
tigate the role of a subfamily of detoxication enzymes
with respect to dietary strategy. Few mammalian herbi-
vores are capable of dietary specialization. Our prelim-
inary data suggest the cytochrome P450 2B subfamily
is critical in the biotransformation of plant secondary
compounds, particularly terpenes. These enzymes may
play a key role in dietary specialization since substrate
specicity and catalytic eciency of CYP2B enzymes
can be greatly aected by small changes in amino acid
sequence. The change of even a single amino acid, par-
ticularly in critical regions such as a substrate recog-
nition site, can have notable eects on metabolism of
substrates. Thus, the structure and copy number of
CYP2B genes may be key in an herbivore's ability spe-
cialize on a terpene-rich diet. The future work con-
sists of characterizing and comparing the amino acid
sequences of CYP2B enzymes of specialist and general-
ist woodrats (*Neotoma spp.*) and possibly other ter-
pene feeders. We are currently sequencing the genome
of *Neotoma lepida* with assembly expected by Octo-
ber 1, 2014. The successful applicant will use this new
genomic information to amplify and sequence CYP2B
genes from a variety of wild mammalian species, com-
pare predicted protein sequence with respect to degree
of dietary specialization, and characterize the function
of the proteins puried from heterologous expression
systems to determine the structural basis of functional
dierences. This research is a collaborative project with
Dr. James Halpert, UConn and provides possibilities
for interactions with his research group.

Barcelona, Spain).
Site: Premises of Sabadell of the Institut Catal a de Pa-
leontologia Miquel Crusafont (Bercelona, Spain).Webpage: http://www.transmittingscience.org/-
courses/gen/hapmap/ The course is entitled to
teach the main concepts of genomic data analysis
using real data from the two most important in-
ternational projects: The HapMap and the 1000
Genomes Projects. In this course you will get familiar
with the data arising from these two projects and
learn how to use it alone or in combination with
other datasets to answer genetic, demographic and
evolutionary questions. The course will alternate
theory with practical computer exercises but it will
focus on hands-on training. Although examples will
be based on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
data in human individuals, most topics covered in this
course can be extended to other types of markers and
organisms. Basic use of the R statistical package and
command-line based environments will be introduced
in the course and previous knowledge is not required.

The current course will present an overview of systems
biology with emphasis on the necessity, uses and pit-
falls of dynamical modelling in biology. It introduces
the required language and philosophy for a smooth and
fruitful collaboration between life scientists and the-
oreticians (i.e. mathematicians, physicists, computer
scientists). The main goal of the course is not a de-
tailed description of the modelling tools in systems bi-
ology, but a thorough overview of the terminology and
applicability range of these methodologies. The time
dedication throughout the course will be one third for
theoretical introduction, and two thirds for modelling
applications for very diverse biological systems. The
participants will acquire the necessary skills to under-
stand and interpret models and modelling results from
scientic articles, and will take the rst steps into build-
ing their own mathematical models.

Manchester Morphometrics
Nov3-Dec12
Dear colleagues
I am pleased to announce this year's morphometrics
course from the University of Manchester. This year's
course will run in the six weeks from 3 November to 12
December 2014.
The course information can be found on the following
we site: http://www.ywings.org.uk/MorphoCourse
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Deni-
tions of size and shape * Geometric methods to char-
acterise shape from a conguration of landmark points
(Procrustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation,
scatter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal
component analysis * Measurement error and outliers
* Shape transformations and 'warping' { the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing be-
tween groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) * Al-
lometry and size correction * Inuence of external fac-
tors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response studies)
* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics of
shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives, QTL
analyses. * Phylogeny: reconstructing the evolution of
shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.
The fee for the course is GBP 320.00.
All prospective participants need to pre-register for the
course. The deadline for this is the *30 September
2014*.
For further details and the pre-registration form, see
the course web page: http://www.ywings.org.uk/-

ProteinEvolutionAnalysis Sep7
ECCB'14 - Tutorial T05 \Protein Evolution Analysis:
on the Use of Phylogenetic Trees"
Tutorial of ECCB 2014, Strasbourg, France. September
7th, 2014
Website: http://www.eccb14.org/program/tutorials/-
pea Important dates:
- ECCB/Tutorial Early registration: May 12 - August
1st, 2014 - ECCB/Tutorial Late registration: August 2
- August 29, 2014 - Tutorial date: Sunday, September
7th, 2014.
Motivation
Homologous proteins, that share a common ancestor,
can be classied into families. These homologs can be
orthologs, that were separated by a speciation event, or
paralogs, that were separated by a duplication event.
Within a protein family, all members are related by
a phylogenetic tree, which consists of a root (the last
common ancestor of the protein family), nodes (which
are speciation/duplication events), branches (whose
lengths correspond to the number of substitutions) and
tips (which correspond to modern sequences). The tree
is helpful for inferring the evolutionary history of the100 EvolDir August 1, 2014
protein family. For example, we can reconstruct the
ancestral sequences at each node of the tree. These an-
cestral sequences can be used for homology modelling,
to reveal the ancestral 3D structures, or synthesised in
vitro. Or we can compare trees to reveal similar evolu-
tionary history between protein families (co-evolution).
Manipulating tree topologies are complex operations
that require tools to perform operations such as read-
ing, pruning, collapsing, rerooting. These operations
can be done with programs with graphical user inter-
faces (GUI). However, in the area of large-scale data,
in which hundreds or thousands of trees may be ma-
nipulated, it is impractical to use such programs. To
this end, new software/libraries have been developed to
deal with such large data sets in an automated manner.
Goal
This tutorial will present recent concepts regarding the
evolution and adaptation of protein sequences. It will
be divided into three sections, in which we will present
methods relating to the use of phylogenetic trees to in-
fer protein function. These sections will be 1) using
scripts to manipulate trees, 2) using ancestral sequence
reconstruction to infer history of a protein family and 3)
the detection of coevolution between protein families.
Each section will have an introduction explaining the
concepts underlying any analysis methods, and a dis-
cussion of the power and limitations of dierent meth-
ods and tools used to explore these concepts and which
participants will learn how to use during the practical
for that section.
Outline
The rst part will focus on tools to detect adaptation
in protein sequences. It will start with a brief introduc-
tion on multiple alignment and phylogenetic trees fol-
lowed by a more detailed presentation of tools available
to estimate selective pressures and detect adaptation
in protein sequences with CodeML / PAML. The sec-
ond part will focus on the reconstruction of ancestral
sequences and ancestral structures by homology mod-
elling. The third part will focus on the identication
of co-evolution between protein families. The organiser
will provide protein datasets, or participants can bring
their own sequences. Then, they will be able to use the
dierent programs/libraries in a practical way.
This tutorial will be in three parts (more info on the
website):
1) Performing phylogenetic analyses with Biopython
2) Ancestral sequence reconstruction and homology
modelling

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that102 EvolDir August 1, 2014
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
