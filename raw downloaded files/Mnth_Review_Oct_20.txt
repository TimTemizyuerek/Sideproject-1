Key researchers presenting cutting edge science
Over the past decade, technological advances that en-
able the characterization of single cells at the molecular
level rather than in bulk tissues have led to signicant
breakthrough discoveries with revolutionary insights indiseases, such as cancer, inammatory and neurode-
generative diseases. Therefore, specic focus of this
conference will be on advances in single cell sequencing,
ranging from transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics to
combined multi-omics analysis at the single cell level.
On top, with spatial context of cells becoming increas-
ingly important to unravel cell functioning and behavior,
a dedicated session will focus on technological advance-
ments in spatial sequencing and breakthrough scientic
discoveries that these have enabled.
This exciting conference puts together an excellent pro-
gram including renowned leaders in the eld that will
cover the following topics:
Long reads & genome structure Single cell sequencing
Spatial sequencing technologies Population scale and
clinical sequencing Technology trends
You can nd the list of the already conrmed key re-
searchers and tech leaders on the conference website.

matical and Biological Synthesis (nimbios.org) are happy
to announce a series of free webinars on Cultural Evolu-
tion.
This series is one of the outputs of a grant \Dynamic
Models for Basic Theory and Applications in Cul-
tural Evolution" funded by theJohn Templeton Founda-
tion(PIs Sergey Gavrilets and Peter J Richerson) aiming
to promote theCultural Evolution Society (https://-
www.culturalevolutionsociety.org/). The grant has sup-
ported the development of online teaching modules on
cultural evolution. Five modules have been completedand are currently available athttp://www.dysoc.org/-
cesmodules. The modules were selected after an interna-
tional competition organized by the CES Working Group
for Education and Outreach composed of Drs.Louise
Barrett(University of Lethbridge),Sergey Gavrilets(UT
Knoxvlle), Russel Genet (California Polytechnic State
University),Patricia Izar(University of San Paolo),Luke
Matthews(RAND Corporation), andPeter J. Richer-
son(UC Davis).
The webinar series includes live presentations by lead
designers of the ve completed modules, an opening lec-
ture by the rst President of the CES and the lead PI on
the proposalPeter J. Richerson(UC Davis), and a lecture
by CES Working Group memberPatricia Izar(University
of San Paolo).
There are also invited lectures by Drs.Peter
Turchin(Complexity Hub Science Vienna) andRuth
Mace(University College London). Besides running
their research programs, Drs. Turchin and Mace are
the founding editors of two important journals in the
eld of cultural evolution:Cliodynamics: The Journal of
Quantitative History and Cultural Evolution (https://-
escholarship.org/uc/irows cliodynamics) andEvolution-
ary Human Sciences (https://www.cambridge.org/core/-

southeastern United States. Typically, this meeting is
a single-session, collaborative conference/retreat envi-
ronment that fosters informal research discussions and
social interactions.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made
the decision to postpone an in person meeting. However,
due to the important opportunity this meeting provides
to allow trainees to present research and network in
an informal community of researchers, we have opted
to continue with a fully online and interactive meeting
this year. We have selected 4 days over the course of a
week in which to promote fun and inviting conference
activities for 1 to 3 hours at a time, coinciding with
either lunch-time or evening.
We anticipate having room for up 15-20 research presen-
tations and 20-30 research posters as part of a virtual,
live poster symposium that will be available on the con-
ference website and connected through Zoom meetings.
Presentation priority will be given to students, postdocs,
and newcomers to the southeastern region.

StateOfTheWorldSPlantsAndFungi
Oct13-15
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that the rst international
State of the World's symposium combining both plants
and fungi will take place online from 13 to 15 October
2020.
Join international experts to discuss actions for protect-
ing and sustainably using the world???s plant and fungal
biodiversity for the benet of people and the planet.Please save the dates and share details of this event
with relevant networks and colleagues.
State of the World's Plants and Fungi Virtual Sympo-
sium 13 ??? 15 October 2020 Online worldwide (over
three shortened days, to accommodate participation
across dierent time zones)
In conjunction with the publication of a groundbreaking
report, scientists, policymakers, businesses, NGOs, the
public and media will come together online for the State
of the World's Plants and Fungi Virtual Symposium.
Plants and fungi are the building blocks of our planet,
with the potential to solve urgent problems that threaten
human life. These vital resources, however, are being
compromised by biodiversity loss and now, more than
ever, we need to explore the solutions that plants and
fungi could provide.
In September 2020 we will be publishing, in collabora-
tion with international researchers, the very rst State
of the World???s report that combines both plants and
fungi. The report takes a deep dive into how we cur-
rently use plants and fungi, what we are missing and
what we are at threat from losing.
This online symposium brings together experts to dis-
cuss ndings presented in the report and to motivate ac-
tions for protecting and sustainably using the world???s
plant and fungal diversity. The outcomes of the dis-
cussions will be used to inform policies and research
aimed at exploring and sharing knowledge and benets
associated with plants and fungi around the world.
By holding it online, we???re able to bring together even
more people globally ??? representing a diverse range
of skills, experience and ethnic backgrounds. Through
our virtual platform???s live text chat and face-to-face
video conferencing facilities, delegates will be able to
network, contribute to the debate, present their results
and spark new collaborations.
Programme The symposium is based around six themed
sessions in which invited experts will address a topi-
cal question through presentations and a Q&A panel
discussion:
Collections ??? Why are they important for averting
biodiversity loss? What should we do to help them
evolve to enable us to address future challenges?
Biodiversity loss ??? What is driving the extinction
rates?
Plant and fungal uses ??? How can we maximise the use
of plant and fungal diversity to meet global challenges?
Genomics ??? How do we embrace novel approaches to
studying plant and fungal biodiversity?October 1, 2020 EvolDir 11
Commercialisation ??? How do we optimise the eco-
nomic benets of plant and fungal biodiversity in recog-
nition of dierent stakeholders??? needs?
Policies ??? How can we work globally to respect and
enable Access and Benet- Sharing and CITES regula-
tions, while increasing the diversity of plants and fungi
being studied?
Other highlights include:
Virtual poster presentations and prizes Workshops and
networking discussions Virtual Kew: experience Kew
Gardens through virtual tours and behind the scenes
video footage
Virtual poster presentations and prizes Delegates are
invited to submit an abstract to present a ???virtual
poster??? ??? a one-minute pre-recorded presentation
using PowerPoint slides, audio and (optional) video.
Prizes will be awarded for the best student and early
career researcher virtual poster presentations.
Abstract submissions will open soon.
Registration and tickets Standard ticket: ??10 Fee
waiver: to help ensure that the symposium is as open
to participation as possible, delegates may apply for a
fee waiver at the time of registration.
Tickets include access to all live sessions and recordings,
virtual posters, networking discussions, virtual tours
and more.

lation genetics, phylogeography and phylogenetics on a
wide array of taxa, including plants and animals. The
research covers general evolutionary biology questions
and ecology related to biodiversity. Current projects in-
volve for example, adaptive evolution on oceanic Islands,
genetic diversity in biological invasions and evolutionary
eects of human mediated translocations and admixture.
The candidate should contribute to the single research
projects from planning to bioinformatics and statistical
analyses. It is expected that the holder of the position
develops a PhD thesis within one of the projects con-
ducted in the lab. The Position includes also a moderate

The ideal candidate should hold a Master in Biology or
related elds and should be familiar with evolutionary
biology or molecular ecology research questions, ideally
shown by a relevant master thesis. The most constant
research lines in the lab are on plants, so a strong inter-
est in Botany is a plus, even though other backgrounds
will be considered. The candidate should be familiar
with the DNA based laboratory procedures and pop-
ulation genetic and phylogenetic analyses. Because of
the strong focus of the lab on data collection using the
lllumina technology, experience with the analysis of the
respective data is desired.
The Position is available for four years, starting from

terested in plant evolutionary genomics. The \Crop Evo-
lution" group of Dr. Markus Stetter at the Institute for
Plant Sciences and the Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sci-
ences (CEPLAS) studies the evolution and adaptation
of crops. We use population and quantitative genetics to
understand how wild plants became crops and how these
crops spread across the globe. Our models are maize and
amaranth (for details visit www.cropevolution.org). The
selected candidate will work on a DFG funded project
studying the evolution of the genomic landscape during
the repeated domestication of grain amaranth.
The successful candidate will produce and analyze ge-
nomic, epigenetic and phenotypic data of wild and do-
mesticated amaranth. The tasks include running green-
house experiments with mapping populations, molecular
lab work, and computational data analysis.
The ideal candidate should hold a master degree biology,
agricultural sciences or related elds with background
in population genetics, quantitative genetics, compu-
tational biology or equivalent. The candidate should
have strong interest in plants and evolutionary questions.

notypic studies have shown that these species dier in
various traits aecting their ability to cope with abiotic
stress and competition. For this project, the PhD candi-
date will use quantitative genetics and transcriptomics
approaches to determine the genetic basis of these dif-
ferences. The PhD candidate will acquire a broad array
of skills ranging from genomics to molecular genetics
and ecology, and develop a solid basis in| experimental
design, data management and analysis.
The applicant must hold a Master degree in Biology,
with expertise in plant genetics and quantitative biology.
This position is open to applicants of all nationalities
but the usual language in the lab is English. Appli-
cations or questions regarding the position should be

Evolutionary tools for genomic analysis
The Goldman group develops new mathematical mod-

studying genomes and genome evolution. We provide
these methods via stand-alone software and web services,
and apply them to biological questions of interest.
For the studentship on oer in 2021, we are interested
in recruiting a student with strong mathematical or
computational skills. Possible projects include:
* phylogenetics of SARS-CoV-2: the rapid production
of genome sequence data from thousands of coronavirus
samples has strained our analysis techniques to their
limits [1]. This project would investigate ways in bring-
ing the most powerful evolutionary analysis methods to
the most challenging data sets like these.
* sequence alignment: recent work in our Group [2] has
led to advances in the accuracy and speed of evolution-
ary sequence alignment, a prerequisite for almost all
comparative genome sequence analysis. This project
would study ways to develop this work further, in par-
ticular towards a multiple sequence alignment method.
* machine learning in evolutionary analysis of genome
sequences: our Group is investigating the use of modern
machine learning (ML) techniques in the comparative
analysis of sequence data to help nd the ngerprints
of natural selection in genome data. Other topics are
possible too, and prospective candidates are encouraged

EvolutionaryBiology
Are you interested in studying the physiology, ecology,
and evolution of awesome animals? Do you like exciting
eldwork in amazing places? If so, consider joining the
Cox Laboratory of Integrative Evolutionary Physiology
at Florida International University in Miami, Florida.
There are currently opportunities for 2-3 PhD students
in the Cox laboratory at Florida International Univer-
sity. These positions will be supported by a combination
of research and teaching assistantships. Florida Interna-
tional University has a great PhD program in Biology,
with excellent support for eld research.
We study the evolution of diversity in nature. Our
research at Florida International University integrates
evolutionary biology, physiology, transcriptomics, and
genomics to understand both the evolution and function
of phenotypic and genetic variation at dierent levels of
biological organization 'V between sexes, within species,
and among species. We study this diversity in amaz-
ing ecosystems from the subtropics of south Florida
to lowland tropical rainforest in central Panama and
the arid highlands of Mexico and the American south-
west. While current research in our lab generally centers
around reptile and amphibian systems, I also study other
animals and am open to exciting project ideas involving
other organisms. Please visit the Cox laboratory website
(www.coxevolab.org) for more information.
Florida International University is located in Miami,
which is a great place to live and work. South Florida
is a subtropical paradise with warm summers and mild
(almost nonexistent) winters. Miami is only minutes
away from two national parks (Biscayne National Park
and Everglades National Park), countless beaches, and
the Florida Keys. Miami is also a vibrant and culturally
diverse city, with the accompanying access to great din-
ing and other recreational opportunities. Finally, south
Florida is an amazing place to study reptiles, amphib-
ians, and other animals, with diverse native wildlife and
dozens of abundant invasive species.
We are strongly committed to diversity, equity, and in-
clusion by creating an environment where scientists of
all backgrounds are empowered to conduct great science.
In particular, we acknowledge that science has systemat-
ically disadvantaged women, LGBTQ people, and Lati-nos/Latinas, Black, Indigenous, and other non-Black
People of Color. We seek to contribute to rectifying
this injustice through training, dialogue, and support
of initiatives that will to make science more just for
everyone. You are encouraged to apply if these same
values are also important to you.

EvolutionaryEcology
Hello,
I have a position open in my lab, which is described
below. Please note that it's open to anyone from any
country.
Understanding how species' ranges change and evolve
is a long-standing problem in ecology, evolution, and
conservation. It is often hypothesised that clades with
rapidly evolving traits can evolve to adapt to chang-
ing climate and minimise competition, but testing such
hypotheses has proved challenging. This studentship
provides the opportunity to use global trait and dis-
tribution datasets our lab has collated (e.g., https://-
www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/823930v1.full) to test
fundamental questions about the ecology and evolu-
tion of species' distributions. You will have the op-portunity to apply methods our lab has developed
(e.g., https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/-
geb.12938) to test fundamental eco-evolutionary ques-
tions, and then develop your own hypotheses and
methods following your own interests. In our lab we
work with policy-makers and conservation organisations
(e.g., https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-
319-93145-6 2), and you will have the opportunity to do
so if you wish.
To nd out more about this project, please explore
our lab's website (http://pearselab.com/) and, if
you're interested in applying, please send an email
with a brief (one paragraph) overview of research
interests and a CV to will.pearse@imperial.ac.uk.
This project is competition-funded through Imperial
College London's President's PhD Scholarships program
(https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-
funding/scholarships/presidents-phd-scholarships/),
whose rst deadline is the 6th of November 2020. Please
contact me as quickly as possible so that I can decide
if your application is strong enough for us to work
together on your application for the program.
Thanks,

the time of enrollment.
* Admission to the \PhD Biology program" in the PhD

to optimal and stressful thermo-oxygenic conditions will
be examined at the organismal and mitochondrial lev-
els. The study will be conducted in the Institute of
Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian University, with
Lecane inermis rotifer as a model organism. The project
includes a three-month visit of a PhD student at the Uni-October 1, 2020 EvolDir 21
versity of Rostock where a student will get acquainted
with the cutting-edge methodology of assessing the mito-
chondrial eciency under stress, supervised by Professor
Inna Sokolova.
The research description: The study focuses on the
mechanisms and the evolutionary causes of existence
of the temperature-size rule (TSR). According to this
very common rule in nature, organisms grow smaller
at higher (more favorable) temperature, than in lower
(less favorable) temperature. This pattern is puzzling
from the evolutionary point of view, because one should
expect that in more favorable conditions organisms will
grow larger to have more progeny. Unless there is an-
other, accompanying factor, driving the TSR. Currently,
it is suggested that the most promising candidate for
this factor is oxygen availability. It naturally decreases
with increasing temperature, lowering the eciency of
oxygen transport into the mitochondria. Body size is
supposed to be a simple consequence of decreasing of
cell size; the simplest solution enhancing this eective-
ness. We will look for the repeated patterns of response,
as those of adaptive signicance, in opposition to re-
sponse variable among individuals, informing about the
mismatch between stressful conditions and organismal
response to them.
The formal application should be sent to aleksan-
dra.walczynska@uj.edu.pl by 24 October 2020 and
should include: 1) A scan of MSc diploma in biology,
biotechnology or other relevant; 2) A reference letter

Sponges (Porifera) are dicult to identify and DNA bar-
coding does not reliably work for all its lineages. In this
project, we aim at further developing novel species iden-
tication procedures based on target enrichment and
NGS technologies. We will apply the methods developed
to a very diverse and taxonomically very dicult group
of demosponges, the Haplosclerida, aiming at providing
reliable species distinction and delimitation procedures
in this group. For this, we will use fresh and recently
collected specimens from the Red Sea as well as ma-
terial from museum collections, including (holo)types
(\museomics"). The project will be conducted in close
collaboration with Professor Grace McCormack of the
National University of Ireland Galway, an internation-ally leading expert in haplosclerid sponges.
We are seeking a highly motivated applicant with excel-
lent and demonstrated bioinformatics expertise, sound
background in evolutionary biology, and willingness to
tackle the challenging task of working with the genomes
of non-model invertebrates. Previous experience in
sponge biology or laboratory skills are not necessary,
but benecial. The predoctoral research associate is af-
forded the opportunity to pursue scientic qualication,
i.e., preparation for a doctoral degree at LMU MUnich,
based on the project's results. Finally, we expect the

languages such as Python and/or R, etc.) and expe-
rience working with *NIX systems. Evidence of this
expertise must be provided. The working language of
the group is English and therefore candidates must have
excellent English language skills. German language
skills are not required.. The position is available for
36 months and will be paid according to the German

LouisianaStateU EvolutionaryEcol
Two PhD Assistantships in evolutionary ecology at LSU
The Tan lab at the Department of Biological Sciences
of Louisiana State University is seeking two PhD stu-
dents to join us in the spring or fall of 2021. We use
an integrative approach, including laboratory experi-
ments, eld observation, and data analysis, to explore a
wide range of topics in evolutionary ecology, including
eco-evolutionary dynamics, causes and consequences of
biodiversity, species diversication. We are specically
looking for candidates who are interested in one of the
following topics.
Adaptive radiation. High phenotypic diversity can
emerge through adaptive radiation when various ecolog-
ical opportunities are available. Due to their high large
population size and short generation time, microbes can
experience rapid adaptive radiation in a short time. We
use Pseudomonas uorescens and microbes from plant
and freshwater microbiomes as the model organisms to
explore the mechanisms that determine the origins and
maintenance of biodiversity in microbes.
Plant-microbe interactions. Plants host diverse micro-
biomes. Because microbes can grow and evolve rapidly,
ecological interactions, such as competition, predation,mutualism, and evolutionary changes, such as adapta-
tion and diversication, can happen at the same time
and strongly feedback on each other. We use aquatic
plants and the associated microbiomes to explore the im-
pacts of microbial eco-evolutionary dynamics on plants'
morphology, physiology, and competitive tness.
The ideal candidates for the positions are expected to
be highly self-motivated, have a general interest, and
some research experience in evolutionary biology, ecol-
ogy, microbiology, or plant biology. Previous experience
in aquatic ecology or microbiology is preferred, but not
required.
Interested students can send inquiries with CV, unocial
transcripts, and a brief statement of research experi-
ence and interests to Dr. Jiaqi Tan (jtan7@lsu.edu).

Project description. The objective of this project is to
study the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to incipi-
ent diversication and species persistence using genomic
data. The project focuses on avian species complexes
from New Guinea; honeyeaters and birds-of-paradise.
In these study groups there are examples of sister taxa
that hybridize in certain part of their ranges but not in
others and species boundaries could be contested since
birds in regions where sister taxa meet exhibit various
degrees of intermediate characters. These avian systems
are ideal to study genetic mechanisms that may impede
hybridization, applying species delimitation methods on
a genomic scale and link hybridization patterns with
environmental change over time.
The genomic data will be generated largely from mu-
seum samples and the project is thus a good opportunity
to showcase how museum genomics and organismal bi-
ology can be used to study hybridization and species
delimitation in taxonomically challenging groups.
The project is part on an ongoing project on evolution-
ary genomics in birds-of-paradise led by the Swedish
Museum of Natural History, as well as a project on
avian dispersal, dierentiation and speciation along el-
evational gradients and across barriers in New Guinea
led by the Natural History Museum of Denmark, and
both projects include extensive collaboration with the
Museum f ur Naturkunde in Berlin.
Qualications. In order to join our team, we are looking
for someone with a background in biology, life sciences,
genetics, bioinformatics, or related subjects. Applicants
should have knowledge and skills pertaining to evolu-
tionary biology, phylo- and population genomics and
bioinformatics. Equally important, we are looking for a
creative, curious and motivated person with excellent
communication and interpersonal skills. No eldwork is
expected to be part of the project.
Position. The position is primarily based at the Depart-
ment of Bioinformatics and Genetics, at the Naturhis-
toriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm. We oer a friendly
working environment, access to professional training in28 EvolDir October 1, 2020
both project related as well as soft skills and access to the
scientic research infrastructure (e.g. High-Performance
Computing Infrastructure, Wet-labs etc) needed to suc-
cessfully complete this project. Moreover, other working
groups within the department include Fredrik Ronquist,
Love Dalen and Per Ericsson. Additional support can
be obtained from the Museum f ur Naturkunde Berlin
and includes access to collections, working space and
the opportunity to collaborate with research groups
throughout both museums. Finally, in line with the
Scandinavian tradition, we strongly encourage a healthy
work-life balance and both Stockholm and Berlin have
plenty of attractive sights, activities and possibilities to
relax.

Project: Fungal endophyte discovery and characterisa-
tion for sustainable barley production
We are seeking an enthusiastic and highly motivated
student for a 4-year, DAFM-funded (Department of
Agriculture, Food and the Marine) project. The project
is supervised by Trevor Hodkinson and Brian Murphy
(TCD) and a collaboration with PIs at UCD, NUI Gal-
way, and Teagasc and aims to discover new fungal en-
dophytes through DNA barcoding and phylogenetic ap-
proaches and then to develop and test their ecacy
as biofertilisers and biopesticides (against aphid-borne
disease and Ramularia Leaf Spot) for Barley produc-
tion. Increasing EU regulations on fertiliser use and
the application of currently available plant protection
products require the need to seek and validate eective
alternatives for growers.
PhD studentship description: A comprehensive collec-
tion of well-characterised new endophytes will be gen-
erated and tested for the promotion of barley growth
and disease resistance. We plan to use DNA barcoding
to identify fungal species. We will then test combina-
tions of the novel endophytes at the glasshouse and
farm scale for crop production. The wild relatives of
cereals represent a largely untapped source of benecial
microbial endophytes and they have huge potential to
reduce costly and environmentally degrading chemical
inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. Our previous re-
search on a single crop wild relative of barley (Hordeum
murinum) highlighted the huge diversity of potential
crop endophytes and developed a focused approach for
fungal endophyte selection and subsequent application
to crop production. Complementary combinations of en-
dophytes will be identied suitable for crop application.
This established approach will be used to nd novel
endophytes suitable for barley nutrient use eciency
and for fungal and aphid-borne disease.30 EvolDir October 1, 2020
Requirements and award: Applicants should have a First
or Upper Second Class Honours degree or M.Sc. in an
appropriate discipline such as Botany, Plant Biology,
Mycology, Pathology or Genetics
Stipend: The student will receive a tax-free stipend of
^A24,000 per year from which tuition fees are deducted.

TuftsU 2 EvolutionaryGenetics
I am recruiting for multiple PhD positions in the De-
partment of Biology at Tufts University for the Fall 2021
cohort. A central question in my research is \when is
evolution important for explaining species' persistence,
and why?" I use model-based simulations, genomic
data, and observational ecological data from a variety of
systems (including species abundance in California grass-
lands and model/non-model genomes in both plants and
animals) to try to address this question. The research
group is brand new, and the exact topic of study for
each PhD student is open. We have many thriving ecol-
ogy, evolution, and genetics research groups at Tufts,
with potential for interactions with other faculty and
trainee colleagues. For more information about the lab
and the positions, please see the advertisement (https:/-
/uricchio.github.io/student recruitment.pdf) or my lab
page (https://ase.tufts.edu/biology/faculty/uricchio/).
Prospective students are more than welcome to
reach out to me with questions or inquiries at
Lawrence.Uricchio@tufts.edu. Students need not haveextensive computational experience. Rather, I am inter-
ested in learning about students' aspirations, especially
in terms of the evolutionary or ecological questions they
hope to pursue, and/or the social and scientic problems
they hope to solve. The positions include a graduate
stipend and health benets.

PtarmiganGenomics
Ph.D. studentship in Rock ptarmigan ecological ge-
nomics at the University of Akureyri, Iceland.
We're seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. student to work
on a fully funded project on evolutionary genomics and
ecology of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) in Iceland.
The project is funded for 36 months, starting in novem-
ber 2020.
The project Ecological genomics encompasses ecology,
genomics, and evolutionary biology, and utilizes genomic
approaches to address consequential ecological questions.
In this the project we will apply an ecogenomic approach,
by analysis of genome diversity and gene expression, as-
sessing the association of genetic variants to population
cycling or intermediate phenotypes of rock ptarmigan.
Within the frame of the recently completed comprehen-
sive project, \Rock ptarmigan health and population
change" spanning the years 2006-2018, a unique tissue
and dataset have been created by the annual collection
from this wild bird population. We aim to explore the
impact of trophic interactions such as diversity of the
gut microbial community, plant-herbivore interactions,
and role of toxins. The health parameters and tissue
collection of Icelandic rock ptarmigan are unique with
no such comparable dataset available elsewhere The
ecogenomic approach will involve generating genomes,
transcriptomes, and miRNAomes from the rock ptarmi-
gan followed by comparative genomics and tissue-specic
expression analysis with the goal to map and character-
ize genomic regions involved in selection/adaption and
to examine how genes are involved in various biological
processes such as abiotic and biotic stress responses.
The main supervisor of the Ph.D. student is Pro-
fessor Kristinn P etur Magn ~Aosson at the Faculty of

SexChromosomeEvolution
Graduate position (PhD): sex chromosome evolution in
a viviparous reptile with genotypic and temperature-
dependent sex determination
Project theme:
Sex-determination controls the most signicant varia-
tion within animals- the division into males and females.
While the dierent systems of sex-determination involv-
ing genetic or environmental control are relatively well
understood, transitions between these systems remain
enigmatic in evolutionary biology. This project aims to
address this gap by revealing the molecular and cytoge-
netic changes required to transition between modes, us-
ing one of only two known lizard species exhibiting both
genetic and temperature control of sex. This knowledge
will have important implications for species conservation,
facilitating predictions of highly biased sex ratios under
climate change, plus potential commercial applications
for species where the production of one sex is favoured.
A PhD position is available to contribute to this research.
This student will conduct advanced cytogenetic research
on species of Australian lizards to help understand the
genomic changes accompanying transitions between ge-
netic and temperature-dependent sex determination.
This collaborative research project is funded by an
Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant
awarded to the University of Tasmania (Assoc Profs
Chris Burridge and Erik Wapstra) and the University of32 EvolDir October 1, 2020
Canberra (Prof Tariq Ezaz). This PhD project will be
based at the cytogenetics laboratory of Prof Tariq Ezaz
(University of Canberra). However, the successful PhD
candidate will spend signicant time at the University
of Tasmania to perform eldwork and some molecu-
lar genetic analysis. The Cytogenetic techniques to be
employed include C-banding, Comparative Genomic Hy-
bridisation (CGH), chromosome microdissection, uores-
cence in situ hybridisation (FISH), BAC library screen-
ing, and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Bioinfor-
matics such as comparative mapping will be also be
conducted.
The Ideal Candidate
The ideal candidate is expected to have knowledge in
molecular cytogenetics (e.g. cell culture, chromosome
preparation, FISH), and genomics (e.g. genomic data
mining, experience and familiarisation with sequence
analyses and NGS technology). Knowledge of chromo-
some biology and sex determination is also desirable.
The candidate will be self-motivated and well-organised,
with a demonstrated capacity to learn and apply the
broad skill set necessary for the successful completion
of a research project. The successful candidate will
be able to work alongside a wide variety of people in
multi-function and multicultural laboratories. The suc-
cessful candidate will also have a strong commitment to
excellence in research and scholarship.
Scholarships
Financial support for domestic and international
students is expected to be available for a high achieving
student through University of Canberra scholarship
round (applications close 30 September). These
scholarships are highly competitive. To be competitive,
candidates should have a rst-class honours degree or

UFlorida SexualSelection
Do you nd animal behavior fascinating? I am looking
to recruit one Ph.D. student for Fall 2021 to work on
the evolution of male-male competition and the form
and function of sexually selected weapons.
We study the evolutionary interplay of behavior and
morphology, often focusing on sexual selection. The
leaf-footed bugs, Family Coreidae, are excellent experi-
mental subjects for student work. These insects wrestle
with their hind legs over territories and have an amazing
diversity of hind leg shapes. Ongoing projects in the
lab include studies of trade-os between weapons and
testes; the eect of nutrition and social environments on
weapon structure, testes size, and male ghting behav-
ior; and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We are
currently reconstructing a phylogeny of the Coreidae to
test hypotheses of weapon shape evolution.
The successful applicant for this position will have pre-
vious research experience and coursework in the elds
of ecology, evolution, and/or animal behavior. Funding
would most likely come in the form of a UF Graduate
Fellowship. To be competitive for this fellowship, a M.S.
degree in a related eld and/or substantial research expe-
rience is required. Prospective students are encouraged
to email Dr. Christine W. Miller at cwmiller@u.edu
on or before October 31st, though I will also attempt to
consider later inquiries. Before sending an email, please
rst consult my laboratory's website, www.millerlab.net
to learn about some of the research priorities for the
coming years.
Your email should include 1) a statement of the kinds
of research questions that you would like to pursue, 2)
an explanation of how these t in with current lab re-
search, 3) a brief overview of your previous academic
and research experiences, 4) a CV or resume, and 5) an
unocial transcript. Accepted students will be provided
a tuition waiver and a competitive stipend.
Diversity and inclusion are more than just words for us.
These are central in guiding how we come together as
a research team, cultivate excellence, and go forth into
the world to share our discoveries and our love of our
work. If this all sounds good to you, then please inquire
about joining the lab!

We are looking for a student who wishes to design
their own PhD research project researching tness
benets and heritability of long-term partnerships.
You will be supervised by Hannah Dugdale (RUG;
https://hannahdugdale.wordpress.com), Simon Grif-
th (MQ; https://grithecology.com), and David S
Richardson (University of East Anglia, UK; https://-
people.uea.ac.uk/david richardson).
This is a double degree at RUG and MQ. For the rst
two-years you will be based at RUG and embedded in the
Seychelles Warbler Project (http://seychelles-warbler-
project.group.shef.ac.uk). You will conduct eldwork in
the Seychelles for a minimum of two seasons (up to 3
months per season), with a COVID-19 contingency plan.
For the second two-years you will be based in Australia
on the MQ campus. You will be part of a team of
PhD students, post-docs, and sta who are using long-
term individual-based datasets of natural populations
to improve understanding of life-history evolution.
As a PhD scholarship student, you will develop your
own research project in consultation with the associated
supervisor(s). You will conduct independent and origi-
nal scientic research, report results via peer-reviewedOctober 1, 2020 EvolDir 35
publications, conference presentations, and ultimately
a PhD thesis. The PhD thesis has to be completed
within four years. Being part of a cutting-edge research
programme, you will receive training in the form of
hands-on instruction, advanced courses, summer/winter
schools, as well as complementary workshops on generic
research and transferable skills. Special attention is
paid to training activities directed towards your future
(academic or non-academic) career after the PhD trajec-
tory, in the context of the RUG ^A^As Career Perspective
Series, and the Research Training Certication Program
at MQ.
Project In socially monogamous species, pair-bonds may
persist over multiple breeding seasons, which can have
important tness consequences. For example, the persis-
tence of long-term pair-bonds can promote cooperation
in territory and nest defence, and improve coordina-
tion in ospring care. Nevertheless, divorce (whereby
previously pair-bonded birds are both alive in the next
breeding season but at least one pair-bonds with a new
mate) is common in socially monogamous species. Why
some pair-bonds persist whereas others do not is an
important question for understanding the evolution of
life-history strategies.
You will design your project to investigate the evolution
of pair-bond behaviour. In the Netherlands, you will
have the long-term Seychelles warbler dataset available
to address this question. Seychelles warblers are cooper-
ative breeders and we have detailed life-history data of
over 2,000 birds, spanning more than 30 years. Potential
research questions are age-specic selective pressures
and the heritability of long-term pair-bonding and di-
vorcing. In Australia, you will work at a comparative
level to investigate questions such as the strength of
pair bonds; behavioural interactions between partners;
and value of aliative behaviours in dozens of species
across one of the most diverse avifaunal assemblages
in the world. These empirical data will be combined
with life-history, and ecological data to understand the
evolution of partnerships.

Project
One of the most profound challenges we all face is our
deterioration with age - a process known as senescence.36 EvolDir October 1, 2020
Individuals clearly senesce dierently, in both the age
they start to deteriorate and the rate they decline at.
However, the underlying causes of these dierences in
senescence patterns remain poorly understood. In partic-
ular, this may be due to trade-os underlying senescence,
and the interaction of genetic and environmental eects
on senescence patterns. Understanding the quantitative
genetics of life-history traits is important as it will po-
tentially highlight deleterious eects that individuals
could mitigate to live longer healthier lives.
For your PhD, you will investigate the relative impact
of environmental and genetic factors on senescence us-
ing two exceptional human archive datasets from rural
Finland and the Swiss canton of Glarus. You will rst
investigate the accuracy of selection measures by asking
how well standard tness measures, such as lifetime
reproductive success and the number of grand-ospring,
reect expected genetic contribution to future genera-
tions. You will then investigate, though a quantitative
genetic framework, the heritability of tness metrics and
genetic trade-os in life-history traits, such as the age
of rst reproduction and longevity. You will then test
whether these genetic trade-os vary across environmen-
tal conditions, between the sexes and with age. Finally,
you will quantify how quantitative genetic parameters
change in relation to the demographic transition.
Qualications
You are expected to:
- hold a (research) master degree (or will graduate before
appointment date) in a relevant eld, such as Evolution-
ary Biology
- be curiosity driven and passionate about fundamen-
tal research in the context of quantitative genetics and
life-history evolution

Intraspecic genetic diversity represents the raw mate-
rial for adaptation and the long-term maintenance ofOctober 1, 2020 EvolDir 37
genetic diversity is therefore a key determined for in-
terspecic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. But
what are the interrelations between intra- and interspe-
cic diversity? With our DFG-funded project, we aim
to use the unique opportunities oered by a long-term
experimental biodiversity project to study the eect of
interspecic diversity on intraspecic genetic diversity.
To this end we will sequence the genomes of all plant
species in a grassland community. This largely bioin-
formatics project involves in-depths population genetic
analyses of these genomic data. We will gain important
new insights into the micro-evolutionary processes that
might contributed to strengthening biodiversity eects
that are frequently found in experimental biodiversity
studies.
Research environment

Unit as a whole provides a multi-angle perspective on
the phenomenon of strengthening biodiversity eects.
It oers a multitude of collaborative opportunities that
give a perfect setting for the project.
Candidate requirements
We look for a candidate with a Master ^As degree or equiv-
alent who has a strong background in bioinformatics
analyses of genomic and/or transcriptomic data. Highly
motivated students with solid training in other areas of
evolutionary biology are also encouraged to apply. The

UZurich EvolutionaryEcol
PhD position in Evolutionary Ecology (4 years): Does
selection for disease resistance vary along an elevation
gradient?
Theory predicts resistance to evolve under pathogen-
imposed selection, yet evidence for pathogen-mediated
selection to generate the observed diversity in resistance
has remained scarce. Biodiversity and ecosystem pro-
ductivity increase toward low latitudes and elevations,
generating corresponding increases in the intensity of
species interactions. However, the evolutionary con-
sequences of such variation in the intensity of species
interactions are largely unknown.
The aim of this PhD project is to study resistance varia-
tion in Plantago lanceolata across an elevation gradient
in Alpine populations in Switzerland through a combina-
tion of eld transplantation and laboratory inoculation
experiments, and through an analysis of variation inresistance-relevant genes.
Applications are invited for a 4-year PhD position to
study the evolution of disease resistance in natural plant
populations by combining ecological, evolutionary and
molecular approaches. Motivated students with a MSc
degree in evolutionary biology, ecology, molecular biol-
ogy, plant biology, or other related elds are encouraged
to apply. Prior expertise in experimental design, statis-
tical analysis, population genomics or bioinformatics are
a bonus, but your most important assets are enthusiasm
for research, motivation to learn new things, and ability
to work independently while being an active member of
a research team.
The working language is English. German skills, al-
though helpful, are not essential.
The project is supervised by Prof. Anna-Liisa Laine
and Prof. Andreas Wagner at the University of Zurich.
The Laine Lab (http://www.laineleb.net) has broad
expertise in studying the ecological and evolutionary
dynamics of species interactions in natural populations
(e.g. Laine et al. 2019 eLife, Halliday et al. 2020 Nature
EcoEvo). The Wagner lab (http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/-
wagner/index.html) is broadly interested in evolution
and life's fundamental organizational principles, with
ongoing work in the lab ranging from the directed evo-
lution of enzymes to laboratory evolution in E.coli and
computational analyses of genetic networks (e.g., Zheng
et al, Science 2019; Payne and Wagner, Science 2014).
The city of Zurich is regarded as having high quality of
life and standard of living with remuneration to match.
During hot summers the lake, river, and many outdoor
pools provide cooling opportunities, and the close-by
Alps cater for many summer and winter outdoor activ-
ities. Local and regional (Europe) rail networks meet
at Zurich's main train station and provide convenient
and low environmental-impact travel to many European
cities. The city's international airport is convenient

SexDiInThermalTolerance
Dear colleagues,
I am collecting data for a meta-analysis on sex dier-
ences in thermal acclimation capacity across ectothermic
animals. This project is led by Prof. Shinichi Naka-
gawa from The University of New South Wales, Sydney,
Australia.
We are seeking SEX-SPECIFIC data on THERMAL
TOLERANCE and THERMAL PREFERENCE, tested
ACROSS DIFFERENT ACCLIMATION TEMPERA-
TURES in sh, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates.
Specically, we are interested in thermal tolerance
measured with a DYNAMIC METHOD (constant in-
crease/decrease in temperature until an endpoint is
reached).
That is, we are seeking data on critical thermal limits
(CTmin, CTmax), chronic lethal temperatures (CLmin,
CLmax), upper and lower lethal temperatures (LTmin,
LTmax) and supercooling points (SCP).
We exclude alternative measures of thermal tolerance
such as LT50, recovery time, survival or time to death.
We are also interested in thermal preference data
measured in a thermal gradient or shuttle box (pre-
ferred/selected body temperature tested with either the
acute, or the gravitational method). We exclude thermal
preference interpolated from physiological performance
(e.g. optimal temperature for swimming activity).
To be included in our meta-analysis, FEMALES AND
MALES must have been tested, and DATA REPORTED
SEPARATELY FOR EACH SEX.
Moreover, at least TWO ACCLIMATION TREAT-MENTS must have been tested in controlled labora-
tory conditions for at least 24H. Animals in each ac-
climation treatment must have experienced SIMILAR
CONDITIONS (i.e. all else being equal) except for the
temperature of acclimation.
That is, animals in each acclimation group must have
been acclimated for the same duration, reared at sim-
ilar temperatures during embryonic development (or
collected from the wild), and acclimated with similar
abiotic conditions (pH, humidity, salinity, photoperiod,
etc.).
If the factors described above (or others not cited here)
were tested in a factorial design with acclimation tem-
perature, we are interested in obtaining this data for
each one of these conditions.
For instance, the CTmax could have been assessed across
two acclimation temperatures, two species, and three
ramping rates in a full-factorial design, which results in
2 x 2 x 3 = 12 combinations for each sex; where species
and ramping rate can be coded as moderator variables
in our meta-analysis.
If you, or your colleagues, may have relevant unpub-
lished data, or articles we have missed in our sys-
tematic review, please let us know and email me at
p.pottier@unsw.edu.au
You can provide us with the MEAN, STANDARD
DEVIATION and SAMPLE SIZE of thermal toler-
ance/thermal preference for each subset of a factorial
design (if applicable), for each sex. You can also provide
us with the RAW DATA WITH DATA DESCRIPTION
(meta-data), allowing us to calculate the mentioned
summary statistics.
Please feel free to contact me if you need further clari-
cations.
This data will be extremely useful for determining
whether sexes dier in their plastic responses to tem-
peratures.
If your data matches our inclusion criteria, your con-
tribution will be acknowledged as a reference to your
original publication (if published), or unpublished work,
in our meta-analysis (main text or supplementary mate-
rials).
Thank you for your time. Kindest regards,

COVID Survey
Subject: Other: Participate in a survey on eects of
COVID-19 on graduate student research in the USA
Graduate students have triple roles in USA universi-
ties, as they have to fulll their teaching duties, course
requirements as students, and conduct their research
towards their degree. With laboratories shutting down
due to COVID-19 pandemic, graduate students are un-
able to conduct planned research and are challenged
to rely on alternative research that can be pursued
during self-isolation or quarantine. This can have ma-
jor implications for graduate students in ecology and
evolutionary biology as projects are dependent on inter-
disciplinary elds of molecular biology and eld biology,
both of which are aected by the pandemic.
The Westerman lab at the University of Arkansas is
conducting a survey which aims to study the eects
of COVID-19 related laboratory closures on graduate
student research and the measures they are taking to
continue their research by working from home. This
survey also aims to assess the similarities (or dierences)
between lab based and eld based experiments. Lastly,
this survey will assess the mental health of graduate
students during COVID-19 related laboratory shutdown.
We sincerely hope that you would take 10-15 minutes o
your busy schedule to complete our survey. Please share
it among your other lab members, friends, department
graduate students or share it on Twitter and Facebook,
to help us reach a wider audience within the USA. You
can nd the link to the survey below.

Debrecen InternshipStudents
Plovers
I am looking for up to 2 internship students, at either
the BSc or MSc level, to work with me on my project on
mating systems biology and ecology in Plovers in Mada-
gascar. Since 2002, the breeding systems of three species
(Madagascan Plover, White-fronted Plover, Kittlitz's
Plover) have been studied intensively across Madagas-
car.
The positions will span a period of up to 6 months, with
some exibility in the time period. Ideally, the students
will be based in Debrecen, however, given current global
circumstances, I am also happy to consider working re-
motely. If students do come to Hungary, the project will
cover some of their living costs. For highly motivated
students and/or those with the appropriate experience,
I am willing to consider the possibility of extending their
projects and covering the costs for them to visit and
work at our eld site in SW Madagascar in spring 2021.
This project is in collaboration with Tam as Sz ekely
(University of Bath; University of Debrecen) and Sama
Zefania (University of Toliara).
I would particularly welcome students who have their
own ideas and questions that they would like to explore
and develop using the Plover system. Potential topics
include habitat choice, mating system evolution, nesting
success, incubation behaviours and dispersal. This is
an excellent opportunity for students to learn how to
manage and drive an independent project.
Debrecen is the second largest city in Hungary and has a
lively university community. The University of Debrecen
was established in 1538, and it is one of the prestigious
universities in Central Europe. The university has over66 EvolDir October 1, 2020
4000 students - many are from abroad. The Dept. of
Evolutionary Zoology and Human Biology is one of the
leading departments in natural sciences. Debrecen Air-
port has connections with some of the main European
airports. Debrecen is located close to Hortobagy Na-
tional Park, a UNESCO-recognised protected area and
an excellent location for wildlife.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get
in touch.

Just a short note that the EU-funded INTERACT net-
work ( https://eu-interact.org) has an open call for
Transnational Access visitation grants that cover travel
and housing costs at more than 50 research stations
located across the Arctic. It is also possible to apply for
remote access, meaning that you can apply for funds
that pays station sta to collect samples or conduct
experiments on your behalf - an option that may be
relevant to researchers until the pandemic is over. The
call description is available at https://eu-interact.org/-
accessing-the-arctic/tacall, and the deadline for applica-
tions is October 15, 2020.
In this context it is worth mentioning that the Norwe-
gian Institute of Bioeconomy (NIBIO) research station
Svanhovd in northern Norway oers possibilities for con-
ducting eld work in diverse subarctic and arctic aquatic
and terrestrial environments. Unlike most eld stations,
Svanhovd also has a modern molecular genetics lab that
can be used during visits.

IntroductionToEvolComplexityScience
Dear all,
With the growing movement towards systems thinking,
there is increasing interest in how the methods of com-
plexity science can be applied to evolutionary systems.
Evolutionary studies are well suited to complex systems
approaches because they routinely involve phenomena
like interactions and feedback, emergent states, and
tipping points.
While some introductory texts on complexity science are
available, the material is typically taught using simple
toy examples. We have found that researchers then
often nd it challenging to apply complexity science
thinking when they encounter messy complex systems
in the real world.
Our teaching material ips this problem on its head.
We begin with a series of richly empirical case studies,
and walk the reader through the process of applying
complexity science thinking to those real systems and
datasets.
To assist in this learning, we have released a series of free
interactive online apps, where anyone can play with real
complex systems data and see how it behaves. Given
the current need for online learning, these resources may
be useful for undergraduate and graduate classes be-
cause the learning material is self-contained and entirely
online. The website is available here:
https://www.islandsoforder.com A key aim was to make
all of our learning material accessible, so we purposely
pushed to make the book associated with the website
as aordable as possible. Princeton University Press
has released an ebook version for under $20, and if you
prefer the feel of real paper, the paperback version is
under $30. Both are available here:
https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/-
9780691192949/islands-of-order Don't be dissuaded by
the title both the website and book are packed with
evolutionary systems, genetics and population biology.
If you have ever been curious about complexity science
and systems thinking, and would like to introduce these68 EvolDir October 1, 2020
ideas into your research or get them in front of your
students, please feel free to take a look.

InvertebrateSamples ForResearch
ArizonaStateU
The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
Biorepository at Arizona State University's Biocollec-
tions is curating and making available for research over
110,000 samples and specimens collected each year as
part of the NEON project.
NEON's standardized and structured sampling of inver-
tebrate communities contributes a major component of
this sample catalog. At each of its 47 terrestrial eld
sites that span 20 ecoregions within the United States,
including Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska, NEON con-
ducts a number of sampling protocols that result in
pinned and bulk specimens and DNA extractions from
carabids, mosquitos, ticks, and ground-dwelling inver-
tebrate community-level samples. The Biorepository
currently has over 45,000 available terrestrial inverte-
brate samples and specimens and expects to add more
than 40,000 each year. To date these samples comprise
335 identied taxa, as well as a broad range of diversity
held within bulk bycatch samples.
Note that NEON aquatic invertebrate sampling is also
underway, but the associated Biorepository collections
are not yet available for research. Please contact the
Biorepository at biorepo@asu.edu if you are interested
in these sample types.
All NEON Biorepository samples are directly tied to
the research design and purpose of the NEON project,
i.e., to facilitate long-term monitoring/forecasting ofecological and evolutionary processes on a continental
scale. Therefore, the available specimens are repre-
sentative of populations and communities in the eld
and associated with high-resolution environmental and
organismal data. Samples received to date are ap-
propriate for answering a wide variety of scientic
questions related to community/population/phylo- ge-
netics, population/community structure, microbiomes,
disease/microbial/ecosystem/macro- ecology, etc. Many
of the invertebrate sample classes in particular are well-
suited to studies of intra- and interspecic variation
within and between sites and seasons.
In particular, we encourage researchers to consider the
use of NEON Biorepository samples in projects proposed
to the National Science Foundation Macrosystems Biol-
ogy and NEON-Enabled Science (MSB-NES): Research
on Biological Systems at Regional to Continental Scales
program (due November 9th). From the program so-
licitation: \Proposers are encouraged to use NEON
resources, and proposals for substantive and innovative
NEON-enabled research will be prioritized for funding.
Substantive NEON-enabled projects rely on data and/or
samples collected by NEON, co-locate research activities
at NEON sites, and/or develop tools that will explicitly
enhance the processing, use, and/or analysis of NEON
data or collections within the context of Macrosystems
Biology research questions."

ager Andrew Johnston and Cryo Collections Manager

We are seeking two or more highly self-motivated mas-
ter students to join our project that aims to advance
our understanding on the relationship between thyroid
hormones and life history variation across vertebrates.
This is a great opportunity for students who are looking
to gain more research experience. The students will con-
duct systematic literature search, including literature
screening and extracting data from the included studies
under guidance. The students may choose one of the
major vertebrate groups of interest (mammals, birds,
reptiles, amphibians, or teleosts), rene the research
question to relevant age groups and life-history traits
pertinent to the chosen taxon, and use phylogenetic com-
parative methods to analyze the data compiled from the
literature.
The students will be jointly supervised by Dr. Bin-Yan
Hsu and Dr. Suvi Ruuskanen at the University of Turku
(UTU), Finland, and work and communicate with Dr.
Hsu on a regular basis. Due to the on-going coronavirus
pandemic that is not expected to subside anytime soon,
the possibility of remote work will be discussed upon
mutual agreement.
To apply, you must already be a registered mas-
ter student in a university and prepare to apply for
a personal grant, such as the Erasmus+, to sup-
port your living. For details about the project and
eligibility, please see: https://www.dropbox.com/s/-

plications for a full-time, scal-year appointment as a
postdoctoral research scholar position in biodiversity
informatics. The position is part of the Biodiversity
Data Science Initiative launched at ASU and led by
Beckett Sterner ( https://sols.asu.edu/beckett-sterner)
and Nico Franz ( https://sols.asu.edu/nico-franz).
The initiative will develop a next-generation, AI-enabled
solution to overcome the performance limits of taxo-
nomic names for integrating data about living things
into scientically meaningful units. This postdoctoral
research scholar position will focus on developing aweb-based taxonomic intelligence platform and innovat-
ing better solutions for knowledge representation and
reasoning, including AI approaches where suited, at
scale. Taxonomic intelligence provides the mapping be-
tween names and concepts necessary to resolve names
accurately into meanings despite changing relationships
across time and expert sources. The initiative will focus
on building an innovative web platform that leverages
theoretical advancements, computational logic, and pro-
totype software for taxonomic concept alignment, with
the goal to establish a robust, scalable taxonomic in-
telligence service that will carry value for scientic au-
diences, science publishers, government agencies, and
environmental consulting rms. The platform will accel-
erate the growth of high-quality, reproducible biological
data by driving the adoption of taxonomic intelligence
metadata in scientic datasets and publications.

Please take a look at a fully-funded three-year position

with the Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Re-

the role that ies (Diptera) play in transmitting mi-
crobes from the environment to domestic animals and
humans. While ies are often viewed as carriers of
disease, exactly what they transmit, and over what dis-
tances, remains poorly understood. We will conduct
high throughput sequencing to survey the microorgan-
isms on two common y species and explore the use of
ies as autonomous drones for environmental sampling.
This will involve sequencing, assembly and identica-

a novel marker system, we will then measure how far
these species can be detected carrying microbes from a
point bait source. This project will generate novel data
into how microbes disperse, but also have immediate
agricultural and medical applications.Having lived all over the world, I will vouch for the fact
that Canberra is a fantastic place to live in terms of

Postdoctoral Researcher ??? Co-evolution of life and
landforms (Reference Number 4367) at the Helmholtz
Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre for
Geosciences - open until 7 Oct 2020
The Helmholtz Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Re-
search Centre for Geosciences is the national centre for
geosphere research. As a member of the Helmholtz As-
sociation we are part of the largest German scientic
organization. With around 1,300 employees (including
our guests) we develop a sound understanding of the
systems and processes of the solid Earth as well as strate-
gies and options for action to face global change and
its regional impacts, to understand natural hazards and
reduce associated risks, and to assess the inuence of
humans on the Earth's system. As a partner in Geo.X,
the GFZ has access to an excellent network of other geo-
science institutions in Potsdam and Berlin. This largest
regional concentration of geoscientic competence in
Europe oers rst-class cooperation and development
opportunities.

Postdoctoral Researcher (m/f/x) ??? Co-evolution of
life and landforms (Reference Number 4367)
Project description: There is now strong evidence for
links between tectonic uplift, landscape evolution and
evolution of life at the Earth???s surface. Examples
include the distribution of micro-endemism in the lemur
population in Madagascar (Horvarth et al, 2008), or the
evolution of biodiversity in the Amazon Basin in rela-tion to the Andean uplift (Horne et al, 2010). Although
much advance has been made in modelling landscape
evolution and speciation in response to external forcings
(mostly climate), few models exist that can predict the
evolution of life on an evolving landscape. In the past
four years, large datasets have been gathered on tectonic
uplift of the Andes, the resulting landscape evolution
and climatic response and the evolution of the biota in
the Atacama Desert. Yet, few attempts have been made
to quantify the links between these dierent parts of the
Earth system and their co-evolution over the past 20
Myrs. We propose to synthesize these results by further
developing and using a new speciation model that we
have coupled to a landscape evolution model.
This project is part of a Collaborative Research Cen-
ter (CRC1211) titled ???Earth Evolution at the Dry
Limit??? between several German universities, including
the University of Cologne (CRC lead institution), the
GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences Potsdam
(host institution for this project) and the University of
Bonn (co-supervisor institution for this project). The
CRC objectives are to study the mutual evolutionary
relationships between Earth???surface processes and
biota in arid to hyper???arid conditions, where both

Post-doctoral position in biomechanics and macroevolu-
tion
OVERVIEW OF POSITION A postdoctoral position
is available in the Moen lab in the department of In-
tegrative Biology at Oklahoma State University. The
position will be part of a team working on a recently
funded NSF CAREER grant. The grant bridges inte-
grative research on macroevolution and biomechanics
with educational and outreach activities closely aligned
with the project' ^As research methods and aims.
The project' ^As key goal is to understand how swimming
mechanics aect macroevolution of morphology and per-
formance in frogs and toads. The research will integrate
local eldwork, experimental work with live animals,computational modeling, and phylogenetic comparative
biology. Some of this work will be done in collaboration
with Chris Richards (Royal Veterinary Academy, UK).
The post-doc will also have the opportunity to design
and work on related but original projects.
The post-doc will also contribute toward the grant' ^As
educational and outreach goals. This includes being the
primary mentor for secondary-education science teachers
in a summer research program. This program includes
visiting Dr. Richards' ^As lab near London. The post-
doc will also help coordinate workshops on phylogenetic
comparative methods, held every other year.
REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERRED SKILLS A
Ph.D. in any related eld 'V including biology, engi-
neering, and computer science 'V is required prior to
starting the position. Strong applicants will have ex-
perience in one or more of the following research areas:
biomechanics, functional morphology, computational
modeling, and phylogenetic comparative biology. Skills
in Matlab, Mathematica, and especially R are helpful
but not required. More than specic experience and
skills, I am seeking highly motivated applicants with a
desire to work both independently and as part of a team.
In the Moen lab we strongly value a diverse and inclu-
sive environment, so I particularly encourage applicants
that can contribute to that goal.
APPLICATION AND POSITION DETAILS Start date:
The position is available immediately, though start date
is exible. Arrival date to OSU may also be exible
given the current COVID pandemic. Initial projects can
focus on data analysis and modeling and started from
afar. However, mentorship and live-animal work will
need to be done at OSU once it is feasible to move here.
Duration: Initial appointment is for one year with oppor-
tunity for renewal of up to three years given satisfactory
progress and availability of funding.
Application deadline: Review of applications will begin
on 15 September, though the position will remain open
until a suitable candidate is found.
How: Applications must include: (1) A cover letter
describing experience and goals for the position (2) A
full CV (3) The names and contact information (phone
numbers, email addresses) of three references.

The Senckenberg Gesellschaft f ur Naturforschung (SGN)
is a member of the Leibniz Association and is based
in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. LOEWE Centre for
Translational Biodiversity Genomics (LOEWE-TBG)
is a joint venture of the Senckenberg Gesellschaft f ur
Naturforschung (SGN), Goethe-University Frankfurt,
Justus-Liebig-University Giessen and Fraunhofer Insti-
tute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology IME
aiming to intensify biodiversity genomics in basic and
applied research. We will establish a new and taxo-
nomically broad genome collection to study genomic
and functional diversity across the tree of life and make
genomic resources accessible for societal-demand driven
applied research.
The Hiller Lab at the LOEWE-TBG in Frankfurt is look-
ing for an ambitious PostDoc (m/f/d) - Comparative
Genomics
The mission of our group is to discover genomic determi-
nants of phenotypic dierences between species, which
is important to understand how nature's fascinating
phenotypic diversity evolved and how it is encoded in
the genome. Work in the lab ranges from genome assem-
bly and alignment to annotating genes, developing and
applying comparative genomic methods to discover key
dierences in genes (such as loss, gain, selection) and
regulatory elements, and using statistical approaches to
associate genomic to phenotypic dierences [1-8].
The postdoc will join our eorts to extend our meth-ods repertoire to accurately detect additional types of
genomic changes, to adopt them to other taxonomic
groups, and to apply them on a large-scale to existing
and numerous newly-sequenced genomes generated by
us and our TBG collaborators.
Your prole:
§PhD degree in bioinformatics / computational biology,
genomics or a related area
§a strong publication record
§excellent programming skills in a Linux environment
as well as experience with shell scripting and Unix tools
§previous experience in large-scale comparative genomic
data analysis is an advantage.
Salary and benets are according to a part time public
service position in Germany (TV-H E13, 100%). The
contract should start as soon as possible and will initially
for 2 years, but funding is available to extend it further.

Postdoctoral research position in quantitative evolution-
ary ecology: Links between evolutionary genetics and
population dynamics in fragmented populations
We have a fully-funded 4-year postdoctoral position
in quantitative evolutionary ecology available at the
Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, Department of Biol-
ogy, Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(https://www.ntnu.edu/cbd).
About the position Properly evaluating genetic threats
to population persistence remains a major challenge in
evolutionary genetics and conservation biology. Specif-
ically, we still need better understanding of key mech-
anisms underlying inbreeding depression and loss of
genetic variation in nature, and better understanding of
how these processes ultimately aect the dynamics and
viability of fragmented populations. The four-year post-
doctoral position provides an exciting opportunity to ad-
dress these questions, as part of a major research project
funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN).
The postdoctoral researcher will work closely with Pro-
fessors Henrik Jensen and Jane Reid and Associate Pro-
fessors Stefanie Mu and Aline M. Lee at CBD, NTNU,
and with two associated PhD students and wider na-
tional and international collaborators.
Job description The postdoctoral project will involve
advanced statistical analyses of extensive genomic data
(genome-wide high-density SNP genotypes) and multi-
generational pedigrees and eld data on phenotypes,
survival, reproduction and dispersal from subdivided
house sparrow (Passer domesticus) populations along
the coast of Norway. It will additionally involve stochas-
tic population modelling.Specically, the rst aim is to integrate high-quality
genomic and demographic data to identify the causes of
spatio-temporal variation in inbreeding and inbreeding
depression, and examine the occurrence and strength
of drift load. The second aim is to utilise novel quan-
titative genetic and genomics approaches to quantify
the eects of inbreeding and drift on adaptive poten-
tial. Finally, the empirical results will be combined with
simulations, population viability analyses and results
from other parts of the RCN project to evaluate the
importance of genetic processes and spatial structure
for the short- and long-term viability of fragmented
populations.
While the project primarily involves data analysis and
modelling, there will also be opportunities for the post-
doctoral researcher to participate in eldwork in the
focal house sparrow populations on the coast of northern
Norway.

PlantMicrobiomeCoEvolution
AppointmentPostdoc: Plant-microbiome co-evolution
Description
We oer a 2-year postdoc position to a Computational
biologist/Bioinformatician in the DFF-FNU project:
Plant-microbiome interactions in modern and ancient
barley. The project is a collaboration between Depart-
ment of Biology (BIO), Department of Plant and En-
vironmental Sciences (PLEN), Faculty of Science, Uni-
versity of Copenhagen, GLOBE Institute (Center for
Macroecology, Evolution and Climate), and Department
Agroecology (AGRO), Aarhus University. The Post Doc
applicant candidate will be part time on GLOBE in-
stitute and part time on BIO and should expect tight
collaboration with research activities at all four institu-
tions.
The deadline for applications is 30th September 2020,
23:59 GMT+1.
Further information about the project on: https:/-
/www1.bio.ku.dk/projects/plant-microbiome-
interactions-in-modern-and-ancient-barley/ Rute
da Fonseca (Globe Institute) will be the main responsi-
ble. Flemming Ekelund (BIO), Kristian Holst Laursen
(PLEN), and Mette Vesterg ~A ¥rd (AGRO) will be
co-responsible.
The position is open from 1 January 2021 or as soon as
possible thereafter.
The main aim of the project is to assess the extent
of plant-microbiome interactions between varieties of
ancient as well as modern barley strains and dierent
microbiomes under dierent nutrient regimes. We will
investigate to which extent modern varieties have lost
the ability to interact with the microbiome with focus on
plant/bacteria/micro-predator interactions. We expect
that multi-element plant tissue analyses, combined with
sequencing of the root/leaf transcriptome, will reveal
genes and pathways involved in these interactions. In
parallel, we will sequence the microbiome to capture
the underlying microbial diversity dynamics that inu-
ence the interactions. Our results will be a signicant
contribution to the understanding of the role of the mi-
crobiome in plant production, and may facilitate more
ecient nutrient utilization, higher disease resistance
and better plant quality.
You will be part of an interdisciplinary research team
that jointly addresses one of the major challenges in
modern biology; i.e. how to understand, link and take
advantage of the relations between plants and the soil
microorganisms that surround them. You will be pro-
cessing multiple datasets consisting of microbiomes and
transcriptomes and establish the relationship between
the plant genetic background and its ability to interact92 EvolDir October 1, 2020
with the microbiome under dierent stress scenarios.
Dissemination of research ndings via scientic articles
is also a major focus point and documentation of good
writing skills is important.
*Qualications* We seek highly motivated individuals
with (most, but not necessarily all of) the following
qualications: 1) A successful PhD in Biology, Com-
putational Biology, Molecular Microbial Ecology, Plant
Molecular Biology or a related discipline 2) Strong com-
putational and analytical skills and experience analysing
large sequencing datasets, including genomic, transcrip-
tomic and microbiome data 3) Knowledge of Python
or other scripting/programming languages is essential
4) Knowledge of R and other statistical software is pre-
ferred 5) An adequate publication record (appropriate
for career stage, including rst-author publications) 6)
Documented ability to analyse literature input and orig-
inal data and present it understandable in oral and
written English 7) Collaborative skills 8) Ambition, en-
thusiasm and aim for a career in science
A genuine interest in soil organisms and plants and ba-
sic skills in microbiology and plant nutrition will be an
advantage. More details and link to the application

UMaryland CichlidSexChromosomes
Postdoc: Sex chromosome evolution in cichlid shes
The Kocher Lab in the Department of Biology at the
University of Maryland seeks to hire a postdoctoral
research associate to work on an NSF-funded project
studying the evolution of sex determination and sex
chromosomes in cichlid shes.
Overview: Cichlid shes are exceptionally diverse, with
more than 2,000 species distributed across southern Asia,
Africa, and the New World. Recent work has discovered
unexpected diversity in the sex chromosomes of African
cichlids, which include the most rapidly diversifying
lineages of the family Cichlidae. This project will test
the hypothesis that sexually antagonistic selection is
responsible for both the rapid turnover of sex chromo-
somes, and the rapid rate of speciation in this group.
The project has three aims:
Aim 1: Genetic Diversity: Characterize sex chromosome
diversity We will use genomic techniques to characterize
sex chromosomes across the family Cichlidae. Regions
of dierentiation between pools of male and female DNA
will be identied using whole-genome Illumina sequenc-
ing. For species segregating multiple sex determiners,
individual genotypes will be obtained using RAD-seq.
PacBio long-read sequencing technology will be used to
characterize patterns of DNA sequence and structural
divergence during the early stages of sex chromosome
evolution.
Aim 2: Phylogenetic Diversity: Correlations with life
history We will determine whether high rates of sex
chromosome turnover are associated with phenotypic
correlates of sexually antagonistic selection (e.g. fe-
male mouth-brooding of eggs and larvae). We will rst
construct a new super-tree encompassing all existing
phylogenetic studies of cichlids. We will then collect
data on the life history and ecology of each species to
examine correlations of these traits with rates of phylo-
genetic and sex chromosome diversication.
Aim 3: Functional Diversity: Incompatibilities and
epistatic interactions We will determine whether func-
tional diversity of the gene network underlying sex deter-
mination creates genetic incompatibilities by measuring
the tness of hybrids between species with dierent
sex chromosome systems. We will then use laboratory
crosses and CRISPR/Cas9 genetic modications to char-acterize the epistatic relationships among the various
sex chromosomes. These data will allow us to test theo-
retical predictions about the evolutionary mechanisms
of sex chromosome replacement.
Minimum qualications: A PhD in evolution, genetics,
or a related eld. Demonstrated bioinformatic skills in
genome assembly and the analysis of WGS datasets.
Interested candidates should email Tom Kocher
(tdk@umd.edu) and include a CV as an attachment.

Published: 1 September 2020
Contact: francesco.cetola@unimi.it
Valid until: 15 December 2020
The Ficetola lab at the Univ. of Milano is recruiting two
postdoctoral fellows, funded by the European Research
Council (ERC). The successful applicant will take a lead-
ing role in the project \IceCommunities: Reconstructing
community dynamics after glacial retreat using environ-
mental DNA", that combines community ecology, envi-
ronmental DNA metabarcoding and a global approach
to understand the evolution of biotic communities inOctober 1, 2020 EvolDir 97
recently deglaciated areas at an unprecedented detail,
and to understand the drivers of biotic colonization.
Research description
Glaciers show a pattern of retreat at the global scale.
Increasing areas are exposed and colonized by multiple
organisms, but lack of global studies hampers a com-
plete understanding of the future of recently deglaciated
terrains. What will be the fate of these areas? How
do animals, plants and microorganisms colonize them?
Which are the climatic, geological and biogeographical
processes determining colonization patterns?
The IceCommunities project is using environmental
DNA data to produce unprecedented, massive informa-
tion on the biodiversity of recently deglaciated terrains
at the global scale.
We are looking for both young and experienced candi-
dates with a strong attitude toward the use of advanced
statistical techniques to understand ecological processes.
Applicants for the position will be hard-working, en-
thusiastic, independently motivated and willing to lead
a signicant part of the IceCommunities Project, and
will join a highly-dynamic work group, with a strong
emphasis on research excellence.
A necessary prerequisite is experience in the use of
numerical ecology to assess relationships between envi-
ronmental variation and modications of biotic commu-
nities. Experience in spatial ecology will be welcomed.
Furthermore, the project is based on the use of molec-
ular data (DNA metabarcoding). Experience in the
analysis of metabarcoding data is not mandatory but
can be useful
Details on the application
The pre-call will be open until we will nd the gures
best tting our needs.
The post-doctoral position is available for 12 months,

A postdoc / research professional position is available
immediately at the Ecological and Environmental Ge-
nomics Lab, Universit e du Qu ebec en Outaouais / In-
stitut des Sciences de la For^ et Temp er ee
Project summary: To eciently protect threatened
species, it is rst necessary to obtain precise information
on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of target
populations. For most species, standard monitoring
methods require a considerable amount of time. To
facilitate the detection and monitoring of threatened
species' populations, the development of new methods
that are both quicker and more sensitive is needed. En-
vironment DNA is now routinely used to detect many
aquatic species. However, this method is still rarely
used to measure a species' abundance in a given habitat.
Furthermore, data on genetic diversity and population
genetic isolation are also needed to design an ecient
restoration plan, and these data could potentially be
obtained directly from eDNA. The objectives of this
project led in collaboration with several federal and
provincial agencies are to develop a semi-quantitative
method based on eDNA to estimate the abundance of
the Blanding's turtle, and to evaluate the possibility to
obtain population genetic data directly from eDNA.
Requirements: The candidate should have a PhD in
biological sciences, or an equivalent research experience.
Ideally, the candidate will have a strong experience both
in molecular ecology lab techniques and in the bioin-
formatic analysis of next-generation sequencing data.
Depending on the candidate's interests, the participation
to other projects is possible (we have several projects on
hardwood tree population genomic and climate adapta-
tion). The exact position (postdoc or research profes-
sional) and the salary (from about 38,000 CAD / year
plus benets) will depend on the candidate's experience.
The position is available immediately for one year, with
funding available for at least another year.
Location: The lab is located at the Institut des Sciences
de la For^ et Temp er ee (https://isfort.uqo.ca/) in Ripon,
a small village located at 1h from Ottawa and 1h30 from

UTasmania GenomicTranstions-
SexDetermination
Postdoc position: Genomic transitions between modes
of sex-determination
Fixed term, full-time, 3 years
Based at the University of Tasmania, Hobart
PROJECT THEME
Sex-determination controls the most signicant varia-
tion within animals - the division into males and females.
While the dierent systems of sex-determination involv-
ing genetic or environmental control are relatively well
understood, transitions between these systems remain
enigmatic in evolutionary biology. This project aims
to address this gap by revealing the genomic changes
required to transition between modes, using one of only
two known lizard species exhibiting both genetic and
temperature control of sex. This knowledge will have
important implications for species conservation, facil-
itating predictions of highly biased sex ratios under
climate change, plus potential commercial applications
for species where the production of one sex is favoured.
A Postdoc position is available to contribute to this
research. The postdoc will perform advanced genomic
and transcriptomic sequencing of species of Australian
lizards to identify the genomic changes accompanying
transitions between genetic and temperature-dependent
sex determination.
This collaborative research project is funded by an
Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant
awarded to the University of Tasmania (Assoc Profs
Erik Wapstra and Chris Burridge), the University of
Canberra (Prof Tariq Ezaz), and the University of Vi-
enna (Prof. Oleg Simakov). This Postdoc will be based
at the University of Tasmania, but will also work closely
with Prof Simakov at the University of Vienna and a
PhD student conducting related cytogenetic studies at
the University of Canberra.
THE IDEAL CANDIDATE
The ideal candidate is expected to have knowledge in
relevant aspects of genomics (e.g. NGS genome and tran-
scriptome sequencing, mapping, screening for orthologs
and homologs, assembly, annotation). Knowledge of sex
determination is also desirable. The candidate will be
self-motivated and well-organised, with a demonstratedcapacity to learn and apply the broad skill set necessary
for the successful completion of a research project. The
successful candidate will be able to work alongside a
wide variety of people in multi-function and multicul-
tural laboratories. The successful candidate will also
have a strong commitment and demonstrated excellence
in research and research communication.
SELECTION CRITERIA
Essential
A PhD, and experience in a relevant research area
Knowledge and demonstrated expertise in areas such
as NGS genome and transcriptome sequencing, map-
ping, screening for orthologs and homologs, and genome
assembly and annotation.
A demonstrated record of publication of scientic re-
search in high-ranking international peer-review journals
Desirable
Knowledge of sex determination systems
Knowledge and demonstrated expertise in phylogenetics,
trait mapping, and ancestral state reconstruction
The position is open to all nationalities. There is the
potential to start this project remotely (i.e., outside

Gutenberg Workshops presents: Aging in Social Insects
25 - 28 November 2020 jIngelheim, near Mainz (Ger-
many)Hybrid workshop format
A characteristic of social insects is reproductive divi-
sion of labor, which led to the evolution of disparate
phenotypes or castes, which dier not only in behavior
and reproduction, but also in lifespan. Indeed, social
insect queens can live for many years (up to several
decades), whereas their workers are much shorter lived.
In most social insects, female eggs are totipotent and
can develop into either queens or workers, in response
to conditions experienced during larval development.104 EvolDir October 1, 2020
Recent advances in molecular biology allow the eld
of social insect biology to investigate the genes, path-
ways and gene regulatory mechanisms that control caste
dierences. It is of great interest beyond social insect re-
search to determine which molecular mechanisms allow
social insect queens to live so long.
This Gutenberg Workshop on Aging in Social Insects
will bring together researchers investigating the evolu-
tion and molecular basis of lifespan in social insects
with researchers working on longevity in other model
organisms to understand how social evolution led to
shifts in the molecular regulation of aging.

Hybrid workshop format
Mutualisms are ubiquitous in nature and shape the ecol-
ogy and evolution of all living organisms on the planet,
from microbes to plants and animals. As such, mutually
benecial interactions are subject to intensive research
eorts, and important facets from the molecular level
to the processes governing the assembly of interacting
communities are currently being elucidated.
The Gutenberg Workshop on The Rise and Fall of Mutu-
alisms will bring together leading scientists in this eld
to discuss recent developments on the factors stabilizing
cooperation in mutualisms, the molecular underpinnings
of the partners' interactions, the determinants of host
colonization and microbial community assembly, and
the impact of mutualistic associations on the ecology
and evolution of the interacting partners.

1. Course content
This course aims at detailed understanding and hands-
on experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one's own biological research questions. An
important aspect of the course is to show how genomic
data can be applied to address and answer research
questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, population
biology, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The
students will be trained in the latest bioinformatic meth-
ods to analyze high throughput sequencing data, which
is present in many research projects. The course will
cover basic computing tools required to run command
line applications, processing high throughput sequencing
data of whole genome / exome / restriction site digested
(RAD) DNA for population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general computing
tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line envi-
ronment, bash commands, data formatting using regular
expressions and basic scripting in the Unix shell with a
series of examples and exercises using a remote server.
The course introduces bioinformatics software for analy-
sis of RAD-data, and downstream population genetic
analysis of genotype data. The course also introduces ba-
sic and advanced concepts of population genomics data
analysis such as genome assembly, alignment/mapping,
SNP genotyping, PCA, population structure analysis,
outlier tests, and demographic analysis based on allele
frequency spectra (AFS).
The course corresponds to 1.5 weeks of full time studies
and and is composed of lectures, demonstrations and
computer labs.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
