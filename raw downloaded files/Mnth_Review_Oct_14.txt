Granada Spain ClimateAdapation
Feb22-27
Dear colleagues, dear friends,
How about discussing breakthrough science with a glass
of excellent Spanish wine under the sun of Granada next
February?
Piero Calosi (Universit e du Qu ebec  a Rimouski,
Canada), Frank Melzner (IFM-GEOMAR, Germany),
Pierre de Wit and myself (University of Gothenburg ,
Sweden) are organizing an exciting session at the 2015
Aquatic Sciences Meeting on 22-27 February 2015 at
the Granada Congress and Exhibition Centre (PalaciosOctober 1, 2014 EvolDir 3
de Exposiciones y Congresos de Granada) in Granada,
Spain (http://www.sgmeet.com/aslo/granada2015/-
default.asp <http://sgmeet.com/jasm2014/ >)
We invite you to submit an abstract to be presented at
the session:
068 - Trans-generational eects of climate change on
marine species
Anthropogenic driven marine climate change is pro-
jected to occur for thousands of years to come, and
to have signicant eects on many marine systems.
While signicant evolutionary responses are expected
to occur during such persistent environmental change,
most experimental studies to date have considered only
short term eects and single life- history stages. Lit-
tle is known about the trans-generational eects and
the relative contribution of plasticity, epigenetic and
evolution. This session will gather experts from dif-
ferent disciplines (climate change, eco-physiology, evo-
lution, -omics) and explore the state of the art of the
eld and theoretical and experimental challenges asso-
ciated with the investigation of the critical role of trans-
generational eects in species responses to marine cli-
mate change. Questions we will address include: - Can
exposure in a specic life-history stage carry-over to an-
other? - Can phenotypic plasticity be used to predict
evolutionary response and potential for adaptation? -
What is the relative contribution of plasticity and selec-
tion? - What are the cost and mechanisms associated
with phenotypic plasticity? - What is the contribution
and mechanisms of epigenetics to adaptive response?

The conference will focus on phylogenetic comparative
methods that are now widely used in very diverse elds
of evolutionary biology to make robust inferences from
interspecic data and phylogenies. Currently, we wit-
ness a rapid ourishing of the phylogenetic toolbox al-
lowing researchers to tackle diverse questions concern-
ing the evolution of species and their traits. We aim
at providing a bouquet of overviews on the most re-
cent developments by the most prominent experts of
the comparative methodology, and also at attracting
an audience from dierent elds of evolutionary biol-
ogy to demonstrate how the phylogenetic comparative
approach can be used to address an ample array of bi-
ological questions in dierent taxa. We still welcome
contributions to the main program (oral presentation

GalapagosSeaLions
A PhD position (E13/65%) to study the energetics of
reproduction and the ensuing consequences at the pop-
ulation level in Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wolle-
baeki) is available in the Department of Animal Be-
haviour at Bielefeld University, Germany, from January
1st 2015 or soon thereafter. The position is available
for three years and is funded by the German Science
Foundation (DFG).
We seek a bright and highly motivated student who has
a proven record of eld experience studying wild ani-
mals. A very good Master degree or equivalent in a rele-
vant topic (e.g. animal behaviour, behavioural ecology,
population ecology, evolutionary ecology) is expected.
The ideal candidate will be able to work both inde-
pendently and as part of a multidisciplinary team, will
have experience with both statistics and genetic tech-
niques and, in addition to excellent spoken and written
English, will be able to speak Spanish.
The study will take place on Caama~ no, a small islet in
the Galapagos archipelago. We have studied Galapa-
gos sea lions there since 2003 and most sea lions are
individually marked (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/-
animalbehaviour/trillmich/sealions.html). Field sea-
sons on Caama~ no last from September-December and
February-March each year. Caama~ no is a small island14 EvolDir October 1, 2014
and there are no facilities at all, so an ability to work
in truly primitive conditions is essential.
The successful candidate will be based at the De-
partment of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld Univer-
sity (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/animalbehaviour/-
home.html) and will be supervised by Oliver Kr uger,
Fritz Trillmich and Joe Homan. The department is
the oldest of its kind in Germany and currently hosts six
principal investigators, seven postdocs and fteen PhD
students. It oers a stimulating international environ-
ment and an excellent research infrastructure including
a brand new molecular laboratory. The working lan-
guage of the Department is English. Together with the
Evolution and Animal Ecology research groups housed
in the same building, there are some 50 scientists and
PhD students from over ten dierent countries working
on related topics in behaviour, ecology and evolution.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with all ex-
pected amenities and easy access to the Teutoburger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It oers a
high standard of living and is well connected to most
major European cities.
To apply for the position, please provide: (i) a letter of
motivation including a 1-2-page statement of your re-
search experience; (ii) a CV including publication list;
(iii) names and contact details of three referees willing
to write condential letters of recommendation. All
materials should be emailed as a single PDF le to:
oliver.krueger@uni-bielefeld.de.
The application deadline is October 15th 2014 and
interviews will take place shortly thereafter. The
preferred start date is January 1st 2015 but is
exible and will depend on the timeframe of the
most qualied applicant. For further informa-
tion, please see http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/-

Subject Header: Graduate Position: DrexelUniver-

The Russell lab at Drexel University seeks driven and
enthusiastic Ph.D candidates to join them in the De-
partment of Biology for the Fall of 2015. The best
applicants will have background experience in molec-
ular ecology, microbiology, microscopy, or entomol-
ogy. Students would work on a collaborative, NSF-
funded project focused on symbiosis in Cephalotes ants
(NSF Award ID 1442144; url: http://www.nsf.gov/-
awardsearch/showAward?AWD ID=1442144)
The central theme in the Russell lab is the ecology and
evolution of symbiosis, and we are addressing the fol-
lowing questions in the ant system:
What are the functions of symbiotic gut bacteria in her-
bivorous ants? How do the genomes of gut symbionts
evolve and how do genome evolution and functional ge-
nomic signatures relate to symbiont roles in ant biol-
ogy? What features correlate with the composition of
symbiotic communities across the ants? What do such
correlations tell us about the likely causes and conse-
quences of symbiosis in this group? We are specically
interested in the question of whether microbes have fa-
cilitated the origins of herbivory across the ants, and
are using experimental and metagenomic approaches
to address this possibility.
Collaborators on this project come from other depart-
ments at Drexel and several renowned institutions be-
yond, providing access to a wide network with diverse
expertise. Students will be trained in the realms of
molecular ecology, metagenomics, experimental biol-
ogy, and eld research. Through Jake Russells joint
appointment with Drexels new Biodiversity, Earth, and
Environmental Sciences, students will interact with a
broad range of faculty and other grad students with in-
terests in organismal biology, systematics, ecology, and
evolution.

NIOO Wageningen
EvolutionaryPhysiology
The department of Animal Ecology at the Netherlands
Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) oers two posi-
tions for a PhD-student (m/f) on the evolutionary ecol-
ogy and physiology of avian seasonal timing of breeding.
The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO) is a top
research institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy
of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). NIOO-KNAW focuses
on fundamental and strategic research into individual
organisms, populations, ecological communities, and
ecosystems. The mission is to carry out excellent re-
search in ecology.
Project description The overall aim of the project is to
estimate the adaptive potential of seasonal timing, an
important life-history trait, in natural populations by
studying the genetic basis of the underlying physiolog-
ical mechanisms and to study natural selection on this
trait, using great tits (Parus major) as a study organ-
ism. We will create selection lines for seasonal timing of
reproduction using genomic selection, and validate the
response to this articial selection in climate controlled
aviaries and in the wild. We will measure changes in the
physiology underlying timing of reproduction caused by
articial selection and thus identify the components of
the physiology which can be aected by natural selec-
tion. Furthermore, we will estimate selection on timing
of reproduction by introducing selection-line individu-
als with extreme phenotypes into the wild and measur-
ing their tness.
PhD student #1 (Vacancy number: AnE-014032) The
PhD student will measure a number of components of
the physiological mechanism underlying the timing of
reproduction in the selection lines to determine which
components can be altered by articial selection and20 EvolDir October 1, 2014
hence show genetic variation. The key question that
will be addressed is whether these changes occur up-
stream of the neuroendocrine system (i.e. brain, pitu-
itary), more downstream (gonads, liver) or only at the
nal stages of egg production. These physiological pa-
rameters will be measured in climate controlled aviaries
(photoperiod and temperature) to determine physiolog-
ical dierences between the birds of the selection lines.
In addition dierences in energetic proles between the
selection line birds will be assessed by measuring BMR.
PhD student #2 (Vacancy number: AnE-014033) The
PhD student will study the causal relationship between
timing of reproduction and tness in the wild by mak-
ing use of the more-extreme-than-normal phenotypes
produced in the selection lines. Eggs from selection line
birds will be brought to the wild and ospring recruiting
from these eggs will be studied in the following years.
Timing of reproduction, reproductive success and sub-
sequent survival of these ospring will be studied in
a wild nest-box breeding population. Additionally, de-
tailed measurements will be done on these selection line
ospring in the wild, including Daily Energy Expendi-
ture during the egg-laying period and feeding frequen-
cies as well as prey choice during chick feeding period.
These PhD positions form part of a larger project
funded by an ERC Advanced grant.
Requirements AnE-014032: We are looking for a highly
motivated and enthusiastic person with an MSc in Ecol-
ogy or Animal Physiology. Experience with physiologi-
cal research with birds and licence to carry out animal
experiments are of added value. AnE-014033: We are
looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic person
with an MSc in Ecology or Evolutionary Biology. Ex-
perience with eldwork with birds and licence to carry
out animal experiments are of added value.
Appointment These are temporary appointments, ini-
tially for one year and upon satisfactory to be prolonged
for a maximum of four years total. The starting date
is 1 January 2015.
Salary The gross salary starts at euro 2.083, - per month
in the 1st year, and will gradually increase to a maxi-

ClimateAdaptation
Vacancy: PhD position
Arctic meltdown aects tropical seagrass meadows via
migrant shorebird
Global warming is most pronounced in the Arctic.
Hence, Arctic-breeding migrants might carry over the
ecological eects of climate change to their tropical win-
tering grounds. Although recently discovered, reduc-
tions in body size are already considered a universal
response to climate change. Red knots (Calidris canu-
tus), medium-sized shorebirds breeding as High Arctic
as possible, are no exception to this rule. Over the past
30 years, their bodies have been shrinking, notably with
respect to body mass and bill length. Preliminary anal-
yses revealed that at their main wintering site (Banc
d'Arguin, Mauritania, West-Africa), small individuals
with a short bill are now shifting niche by consuming
readily accessible seagrass rhizomes instead of deeper
buried shellsh. Here we will (A) experimentally un-
ravel the coupling between body size and diet; (B) link
survival rate to body size and diet; and (C) quantify
the top-down eects of rhizome-grazing on seagrass.
Whilst the eld work will be carried in Mauritania,
the laboratory and desk work will mainly be car-
ried out at the Department of Marine Ecology, NIOZ
Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (Texel,
the Netherlands; http://www.nioz.nl). However, in this
MARES-EU funded project, regular visits will be made
to the two partner universities, University of Aveiro
(Portugal) and the University of Gda Ask (Poland).
Prole The subject is open to highly motivated students
that have a background in (marine) ecology, prefer-
ably with anities to birds. The proposed eldwork inOctober 1, 2014 EvolDir 21
Banc d'Arguin will be embedded in large expeditions
in which a consortium of international researchers is
involved. Henceforth, the candidate should be a team
player, but, at the same time, should be able to work in-
dependently under seemingly pleasant, but sometimes
tough, eld circumstances. Because this project in-
volves Dutch, Portuguese and Polish partners, the reg-
ulations set by MARES-EU demand that candidates
should have obtained their master degree outside the
Netherlands, Portugal and Poland.
Employment details The candidate will be employed
by NIOZ for a period of three years, under the col-
lective agreement of Dutch universities and research
institutions. This includes a gross monthly salary of

RuhrU EvolutionSeaSpiders
PhD position in marine molecular evolutionary biology,
Ruhr-University Bochum & Bavarian State Collection
Munich.
Topic: \Speciation and adaptation in Southern Ocean
sea spiders"
The Department of Animal Ecology, Evolution and Bio-
diversity at Ruhr University Bochum (working group
Dr. Florian Leese) in collaboration with the Bavarian
State Collection of Zoology (working group Prof. Dr.
Roland Melzer) oers 1 PhD position (67% TvL E13)22 EvolDir October 1, 2014
in the eld of marine molecular evolutionary biology.
The candidate will work in the project \Speciation and
adaptation in Antarctic sea spiders" as part of the
DFG Priority Programme 1158 (\Antarctic Research",
www.spp-antarktisforschung.de/). The project seeks
to extend our knowledge of speciation in the South-
ern Ocean benthos. In the past years, population ge-
netic studies have shown that many species have ra-
diated in the Antarctic probably in ice-free refugia on
the Antarctic shelf during the last glacial maxima. In
the studies, speciation is often seen as a result of ran-
dom genetic drift / lineage sorting in geographic iso-
lation (allopatric speciation). The importance of se-
lection in this context has been largely neglected. In
the project, we apply next-generation sequencing tech-
niques to study patterns of genetic variation in the
genomes/transcriptomes of two \cryptic" Antarctic sea
spider ocks (Colossendeis megalonyx and Pallenopsis
patagonica) inside and outside the Antarctic to com-
pare neutral and non-neutral variation in the species
groups. In addition, modern morphological techniques
will be used to screen for adaptive morphological traits
in co-existing species on the shelf.
The candidate will be based primarily in Bochum but
will also conduct analyses at the Bavarian State Col-
lection in Munich as well as in the labs of international
collaboration partners.
Applicants should hold a degree (M.Sc, Diploma) in a
relevant eld (e.g., Biology, Ecology, Biodiversity, Ma-
rine Biology, Molecular Genetics). We expect a solid
knowledge of population genetic and molecular evolu-
tionary concepts. The candidate should have acquired
expertise in the preparation of next-generation sequenc-
ing libraries (e.g. transcriptome, genome, RAD) and
respective bioinformatic analyses. Knowledge of sea
spiders (Pycnogonida) as well as of morphological and
morphometric analysis techniques will be of advantage.
She/he is uent in English language, very motivated
and able to work independently in dierent working
groups.
Please contact Dr. Florian Leese (orian.leese@rub.de)
for further information.
Applications should be send as a single pdf le
not later than the 26th of September 2014 to o-
rian.leese@rub.de. They should include a letter of mo-
tivation, a complete curriculum vitae with university
certicates as well as names and contact details of two
academic referees. Candidates will be invited for inter-
views by the end of September 2014 and interviews for
the position will take place in the second week of Octo-
ber 2014. The candidate should start on December 1st
in Bochum.Ruhr University Bochum is committed to promoting
the careers of women and therefore actively welcomes
applications from female candidates. As an equal op-
portunities employer, we also encourage applications
from suitably qualied disabled candidates and other

AmphibianEvolutionaryGenomics
A PhD position is available in the Conservation and
Evolutionary Genetics Group at Estaci on Biol ogica de
Do nana, Seville (Spain) on Amphibian Evolutionary
Genomics
The PhD position is part of the project: A stroll with
amphibians along the path of speciation: from micro
to macro evolutionary processes funded by the Spanish
Government (\Procesos micro y macro evolutivos en la
diversicaci on de anbios", CGL2013-47547-P).
Recent years have seen an increase in the knowledge of
the amphibian diversity in the Neotropics. Many new
species are being described every year at the same time
that many others become part of the lists of endan-
gered species. However, little is known about the pat-
terns and processes that explain this diversity. In this
proposal we join the eorts of research groups in four
countries (Spain, Sweden, Mexico, USA and Brazil) to
study the origin of the diversity of amphibians at very
dierent spatial and temporal scales and using diverse
analytical approaches. We will assemble one transcrip-
tome and use genomic approaches to study the demo-
graphic and evolutionary history of a genus of Neotropi-
cal frogs in the absence of a genome sequence of a closely
related species that could be used as a reference. This
genus includes species adapted to highland and low-
land environments. We will investigate the phylogen-
tic relationships between species, we will track demo-
graphic changes through time and their correspondence
with habitat changes, and we will identify portions of
the genome that are dierentiated between populations
with dierent degrees of isolation and that could indi-
cate incipient speciation.
Methods: -Transcriptome assembly, mapping sequences
obtained with Next Generation Sequencing approaches,
demographic inference. -Analysis of population struc-
ture using genotyping-by-sequencing approaches.October 1, 2014 EvolDir 23
Candidates: -The candidate should have a masters de-
gree or equivalent degree in Biology, Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, Biotechnology or Bioinformatics -Previous experi-
ence working with next-generation-sequencing data and
bioinformatic analyses is highly desirable -Analytically
inclined, familiarity with work in a Linux/Unix environ-
ment is highly desirable. The project will require pro-
gramming in Perl or Python and the analysis of large
genomic databases -Procient in both written and spo-
ken English -Willing to work abroad (we expect that
part of the work will be carried out in close collabo-
ration with our Swedish colleagues) -Dynamic, eager
to learn and willing to participate in all the activities
run by the research group (weekly meetings, seminars,
discussions ^ a)
The project does not include eld work. Samples are
already available in scientic collections.

PhD student position in Animal Ecology
PhD student position in Animal Ecology at the Depart-
ment of Zoology. Reference number SU FV-2470-14.
Deadline for applications: October 1, 2014.
Project: Evolutionary relevance of non-genetic inher-
itance We are seeking a highly motivated PhD stu-
dent with an interest in evolutionary ecology to take
part of the research project \Epigenetic inheritance and
its evolutionary consequences on the genetic architec-
ture of complex traits", with nancial support from the
Swedish Research Council. The project aims to inves-
tigate central biological questions on how non-genetic
(e.g. \epigenetic") parental eects inuence the expres-
sion of complex traits. Such epigenetic eects may be
induced by, for example, environmental conditions or
the interactions between the nuclear DNA and the cy-
toplasmic DNA. Understanding epigenetic eects has
implications for core evolutionary processes such as her-
itability, maintenance of genetic variation and specia-
tion. Still, we have only a rudimentary understanding
of how evolutionary processes are aected by these epi-
genetic eects. Using two study systems (Drosophila
and Poeciliid shes) and combining experimental ma-
nipulations with molecular methods the project will ex-
plore how non-genetic parental eects can be caused
by either the cytoplasmic DNA or environmental con-
ditions. The project also aims at investigating the in-
heritance of these epigenetic eects, and how they af-
fect evolutionary processes - an important and exciting
eld in biology. The PhD project involves experiments,
molecular lab-work and statistical analysis.
Qualications To be qualied for research studies in
animal ecology the applicant must have completed a
research degree (e.g. Master's), or have passed at least24 EvolDir October 1, 2014
120 hp (2 years) of biological studies, including an ap-
proved independent project of at least 30 hp at ad-
vanced level (\examensarbete") within ecology, evolu-
tionary biology or related subjects. Applicants, who
have in principle acquired the corresponding compe-
tence in Sweden, or abroad, are also qualied.
Criteria for selection Among qualied applicants, se-
lection is made according to the ability to prot from
the studies. The criteria to be used are properly docu-
mented competence within the described research area,
capabilities with regards to speaking and writing in

dependence, and team work performance. Experience
with statistical analysis is an advantage. The appli-
cant's earlier experience within the eld of research
can be of relevance especially when further documented
by university courses, independent research works, per-
sonal references, interview and an application indicat-
ing the applicant's motivations in written form.
Terms of employment The PhD studies include 48
months of full-time studies with employment as PhD
student. The salary starts at 23.700SEK/month.

Harrison at Cornell University, and the successful ap-
plicant will be part of a larger team at both Cornell
and Tufts.
Our work focuses on the evolution of barriers to gene
exchange during speciation. We apply a combination
of comparative and experimental approaches using the
European corn borer moth as a model system. Corn
borers are a textbook example of incipient speciation, in
which one species splits into two through the evolution
of multiple forms of reproductive isolation. Of 12 po-
tential isolating barriers between corn borer \strains,"
seven signicantly reduce gene ow and ve are either
behavioral or ecological in nature. Current eorts are
to identify the molecular genetic basis for traits con-
tributing to reproductive isolation, to characterize the
evolutionary history of these traits, and to evaluate the
consequences of barrier loci on tness and gene ow in
nature.
We seek a creative and motivated graduate student to
work on speciation, adaptive evolution, or genome evo-
lution. Students must have the ability to work with oth-

TuftsU FoodMicrobialEcolEvolution
PhD Positions in the Wolfe lab @ Tufts University,
Medford, MA (Boston Area), USA Ecology and evo-
lution of microbes in food systems
The Wolfe lab in the Department of Biology at Tufts
University is seeking several Ph.D. students to join the
lab in the Fall of 2015. Our lab studies the ecology and
evolution of microbial communities, using tractable mi-
crobial communities isolated from food (cheese, salami,
and other fermented foods) as model systems. Our
work spans taxonomic boundaries (we study both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes) and integrates a wide va-
riety of techniques including experimental evolution,
metagenomics, comparative genomics/transcriptomics,
genome engineering, and in situ community reconstruc-
tions. Our research questions are strongly anchored in
basic biology, but our work will help address emerging
issues in human health and food security.
Current research in the lab is aimed at linking ecologi-
cal and evolutionary patterns in microbial communities
with the molecular mechanisms that generate these pat-
terns. What are the molecular mechanisms that govern
species distributions or community-level traits? How
do these mechanisms evolve within a community and
what are the consequences of trait evolution within mi-
crobial communities? We are particularly interested
in exploring these questions with a focus on bacterial-fungal interactions.
The Wolfe lab is based in a brand new open lab space
associated with the Tufts University Medford Cam-
pus. In addition to diverse research being conducted
in the Department of Biology that spans the entire
breadth of biology (http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/), the
Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at the
Tufts Medical School has an outstanding group of mi-
crobiologists (http://bit.ly/WDvgqA). There are also
numerous potential collaborators and resources at the
Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition and the Cummings
School of Vet Medicine. A new university-wide initia-
tive, the Tufts Institute for Innovation, is providing re-
sources to support interdisciplinary research projects
that explore how microbes can improve the environ-
ment and the human condition (http://bit.ly/1niy6Ix).
The academic community in the Greater Boston Area
has an unprecedented collective wealth of resources in
microbiology, ecology, and evolution.
Applicants should have a background in ecology, evo-
lution, molecular biology, mycology, and/or microbiol-
ogy. Ideal candidates would also have a strong interest
in the biology of food systems. Our work has incredible
potential for science outreach and education, and mem-
bers of my lab will be encouraged to communicate their
science through social media, writing, and public out-
reach events. Students will be provided ample training
for postgraduate work in academia, but I will strongly
support professional development to help graduate stu-
dents become leaders in industry, agriculture, and other
non-academic career paths.
A formal lab website is in production. In the mean-
time, candidates should check out my personal website
(www.benjaminewolfe.com) for an overview of my past
and current research and teaching activities.
Interested candidates should contact Benjamin Wolfe

conict arises because of dierent tness optima for a
given behaviour. Consequently, parents will negotiate
how much to invest, which will depend on how well they
are informed about ospring need and about the con-
tribution of their partner. In the proposed project we
will make use novel GPS tracking devices to investigate
parental decision rules, along with their consequences
for ospring development in great detail. We will ap-
ply sophisticated cross-fostering experiments in a wild
population of individually marked Lesser black-backed
gulls, a long-lived migratory species breeding in a het-
erogeneous environment. We combine large scale be-
havioral observations, physiological measures and state-
of-the-art tracking approaches. The latter will also en-
able us to track carry-over eects of the rate of parental
care throughout the annual cycle.

UCalgary LimbEvolution
Graduate Student Opportunity
The Rolian lab at the University of Calgary is looking
to recruit highly qualied and motivated graduate stu-
dents at the Masters and Doctoral levels, to begin in
May or September 2015, or 2016. Our lab studies the
limb musculoskeletal system in mammals. Through ar-
ticial selection, we have created a line of mice in which
the limb bones have become elongated relative to body
mass. This unique resource is being used to understand
how the limb skeleton evolves, from genomic and devel-
opmental perspectives, and how limb bone length in-
uences musculoskeletal function in health and disease.
Students joining the lab will have the opportunity to
develop their own projects in consultation with Dr. Ro-
lian, with topics ranging from genetic, developmental,
evolutionary and/or biomechanics aspects of this verte-
brate model, to its relevance to musculoskeletal health
in humans.
The ideal candidate will have an outstanding record
and background in biology or life sciences, with a focus
on evolutionary biology. Basic knowledge of vertebrate
comparative anatomy is desirable. The student should
be competitive for external and/or internal funding
(e.g., NSERC, CIHR). The University of Calgary is a
young and vibrant research intensive university in Cal-
gary, Alberta, Canada, recently voted one of the world's
top livable cities. The university emphasizes cross-
disciplinary work, and the Rolian lab is well integrated
with the faculties of Veterinary Medicine, Medicine and
Science, and with the McCaig Institute for Bone and
Joint Health. Interested candidates should send Dr.
Rolian a CV and a short description outlining their in-
terests in graduate work in our research group.

EvolutionAntibioticsResistance
The Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genet-
ics at the Zoological Institute of the University of Kiel
is seeking to ll a position within the research project
^ aEvolution of antibiotic resistance\ for aPhD student (m/f)
The position will be for three years. The salary will be
according to the German TV-L-13 pay scale.
Description:
The alarming spread of resistant bacteria is complicat-
ing even the most routine clinical interventions. Case
in point are highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
which cause almost untreatable respiratory and wound
infections in the hospital, and play a driving role in
cystic brosis.
The discovery of new antibiotics may oer temporary
relief from resistance, but it is slow and costly, and
does not address the heart of the matter: resistance is
an evolutionary response to the use of antibiotics. Our
research program is aimed at investigating the evolu-
tionary dynamics underlying antibiotic resistance evo-
lution during in vitro antibiotic therapies. The purpose
is to devise ways in which existing antibiotics can be
intelligently used to prevent or at least slow down the
evolution of resistance. The project will involve exper-
imental evolution using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
subsequent phenotypic, genomic and functional-genetic
analyses of resistant strains.
The project is funded by the German Science Foun-
dation (DFG) and will be based in the Department
of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics at the Univer-
sity of Kiel, Northern Germany, under the supervision
of Dr. Gunther Jansen and Prof. Hinrich Schulen-
burg (www.uni-kiel.de/zoologie/evoecogen). The de-
partment provides an international and interactive at-
mosphere, while Kiel University and connected insti-
tutes (e.g., Max Planck Institute in Ploen) oer a stim-
ulating research environment with a particular focus
on evolutionary biology. The city of Kiel is a medium-
sized pleasant town located at the coast of the Baltic
Sea. It is the capital of the most Northern state of Ger-
many, Schleswig-Holstein. It oers many opportunities
for leisure activities, including theatres, an opera, the
Schleswig-Holstein classical music festival, the world's
largest metal festival in Wacken, sailing, surng, cy-
cling, and the famous festivities of the ^ aKieler Woche\
{ one of the major sailing events in Europe.
Requirements for the position:
Master in biology, genetics, microbiology, or related
topic; excellent background in evolution and microbiol-
ogy are a must, further required are experience with ge-
netics, statistics and dealing with complex experimental
designs; high motivation; a collaborative spirit; uency
in English.
The University of Kiel strives to increase the propor-30 EvolDir October 1, 2014
tion of women in research and education. It therefore
encourages qualied women to apply. Women will be
preferred in cases of comparable qualications. It also
explicitly welcomes applications from people with a mi-
gratory background. The University further makes an
eort to employ disabled people and will prefer such
candidates in case of equal qualication.
Please send applications with CV, one-page statement
of research interests, and two references, as a pdf-le
by email to gjansen@zoologie.uni-kiel.de. For further
details and questions, you are welcome to contact me

ULausanne EvolutionaryEntomology
A fully-funded PhD position is available at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution (U Lausanne) and the
Museum of Zoology in Lausanne to work on the evolu-
tionary ecology of reproductive modes in mayies, co-
supervised by Michel Sartori and Tanja Schwander.
Start in January 2015 or soon thereafter.
The evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction
has been one of the major questions in evolutionary bi-
ology for the last decades: although biparental sex en-
tails many costs, asexuality is rare among metazoans.
The PhD candidate will assess the contribution of vari-
ous factors to the maintenance of sex and parthenogene-
sis in natural populations of mayies (Ephemeroptera).
Facultative parthenogenesis is known to occur in many
species, with a high level of variation: some species
are characterized by very ecient parthenogenesis with
high egg hatching success whereas virgin females in
other species produce hardly any ospring. Such vari-ation allows testing various costs and benets of sexual
reproduction and parthenogenesis, depending on dier-
ent ecological contexts in a comparative framework.
We are looking for outstanding candidates with a back-
ground in ecology, evolutionary biology or equivalent
(note that a master degree is required by the doctoral
school to enter the PhD program). In addition to aca-
demic qualications, a certain practical air is neces-
sary for surveying natural populations (eld work) and
possibly optimize/ develop rearing conditions.
Interested candidates should send a motivation let-
ter, cv (including contacts for references) and diplo-
mas as a single pdf le to tanja.schwander@unil.ch
no later than October 10. For additional informa-
tion about the topic, contact michel.sartori@vd.ch or

UK
PhD studentship: Theory of social adaptationNatural selection explains the appearance of design in
the living world. But at what level is this design ex-
pected to manifest - gene, individual, society - and what
is its function? Social evolution provides a window on
this problem, by pitting the interests of genes, individ-
uals and societies against each other.
I invite applications for a PhD studentship in my re-
search group at the School of Biology, University of St
Andrews, UK. I'm looking for a biology graduate who
has a strong interest in social evolution theory, or an
economics / mathematics / philosophy / physics grad-
uate with a strong interest in social behaviour.
Current research in my lab involves development of
general theory - using kin selection, multilevel selec-
tion, game theory and theoretical population genet-
ics approaches - and application of mathematical and
simulation models that are tailored to the biology of
real organisms, from microbes to insects to humans
(see www.andygardner.org for more details). To this
end, I strongly encourage interactions within the wider
grouping of theoretical and empirical biologists in St
Andrews, as well as with collaborators further aeld.
If social evolution really fascinates you, and you are
a careful thinker, then you will ourish in the type of
project that I enjoy supervising. Theoretical projects
suit people of either sex, from any background, regard-
less of physical abilities.

summary. This project is jointly hosted by Wagenin-
gen University (the Netherlands) and the Swedish Uni-
versity of Agricultural Sciences (Sweden), in close col-
laboration with the Department of Animal Ecology of
the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW).
Please see http://www.egsabg.eu/ for further infor-

that applicants who obtained their MSc in one of the
countries hosting the project (the Netherlands, Swe-
den) are not eligible . For further information on the
project please contact Prof. Martien Groenen (mar-
tien.groenen@wur.nl).
Project summary:
The rate at which organisms can adapt to climate
change is one of the key factors determining the de-
gree of biodiversity loss. One of the key ecological im-
pacts of global climate change is that it has led to clear
shifts in seasonal timing, a prime example of a phe-
notypically plastic trait in which environmental vari-ables, in interaction with the genetic background, de-
termine the trait value. The focus of this project will be
phenotypic plasticity in the passerine bird the great tit
(Parus major). The aim is to identify genomic regions
involved in a number of traits including egg laying date,
clutch size, weight at 15 days, tarsus and hatchability
of eggs using an association study on a population of
2500 female birds measured for these traits and geno-
typed with 675,000 SNPs distributed evenly across the
genome. Because genetic correlations between traits
under selection could constrain evolutionary change, ge-
netic correlations will be estimated between the traits
measured in these birds, using actual relatedness in-
stead of pedigree-based relatedness. Within the project
you will also analyse the 4th generation of the two se-
lection lines, currently being produced, to identify the
regions under selection. The complete genome sequence
of the founder animals of the selection lines will be
available, which allows a detailed analysis of the under-
lying genes and genetic variants under selection. The
project requires excellent skills in quantitative genetics
and bioinformatics.

The Fisher Lab is seeking a computationally-minded
molecular epidemiologist/ecologist to join a research
group investigating the evolutionary ecology of chytrid
fungi causing global amphibian extinctions. Continu-

are investigating the patterns and processes that are
leading to disease-driven amphibian declines by util-
ising population genomics, experimental ecology and
eldwork. Our work has been key to identifying the
fungal lineages and species that are emerging to cause
amphibian declines, and the vectors that are leading
to the spread of these invasive pathogens. The project
will focus on discovering new lineages of amphibian-

Israel FieldAssist
SalamanderEvolution
*Field Assistant Job in Israel*
Location: Tel Dan, upper Galilee and Carmel Moun-
tains, Israel Time: mid October 2014 until January
2015 ( ~3 months) Language: english or german re-
quired Payment: Flight will be covered and there will
be a small salary.
*Job description* We compare how two species of the
re salamander *Salamandra salamandra* in Germany
and *S. infraimmaculata* in Israel adapted to dif-
ferent habitat types with often fast uctuating envi-
ron^A'mental conditions. For our second eld season
in Israel, we are looking for a self motivated, hard
working eld assistant. The project includes a capture-
recapture study of adult salamanders at night. We will
do ecological experiments about the larviposition be-
haviour of the female re salamanders and the devel-
opment of the larvae in the Tel Dan nature reserve. In
addition, we will also collect tissue samples (tail tips)
from larvae at dierent sites in the north of Israel and
transplant larvae between dierent habitat types to in-
vestigate dierences in gene expression. The position
requires a lot of work in rainy, cool nights (down til
4^AC) for a capture-recapture project. We take pic-
tures of the adult salamanders to recognize individuals
by means of the spot pattern. Night work can take 3-4
hours and sometimes several nights in one week, which
can be tiring. Some sites are remote and short hikes,
walks through dense vegetation and wading in muddy
ditches can be required; though most sites are easy to
access. At the beginning of the season we will need
to dig holes and set fences in order to build an out-
door enclosure for the female salamanders. You should
be familiar with collecting scientic data and have some
experience in handling wild animals. It would be an ad-48 EvolDir October 1, 2014
vantage if you lived abroad before and if you can easily
adapt to new situations. There will be regular visits at
the Haifa University to see our project partners.
*What to expect* The north of Israel has some wetland
and the jordan river starts in this area. You can visit
numerous nature parks and reserves and observe a very
rich fauna: hyrax, jackals, antelopes, stellions (Agama),
geckos and chameleons. In winter, the area is also home
or resting place for many migrating bird species (e.g. 3
kingsher species, cranes, hoopoes, palestine sunbirds,
vultures). The climate in winter is mild, in October
between 15-30 ^A C, and from December to January be-
tween 8 - 20 ^A C. The rainy season lasts from October
until March. There will be strong rain but often fol-
lowed by some dry days or weeks. Since houses are
barely insulated, good cloths are of great importance.
The north of Israel is as far from Gaza as possible.
I was told that things stayed very calm in the north.
Notwithstanding the above, there is always a danger
from nearby Lebanon and Syria. The risk is lower, since
we are in nature reserves and not in a big city.
*How to apply?* Send a short motivation letter stat-
ing why you are interested and your CV via email to
e.kuepfer@tu-bs.de. If you have any further questions
about the project, dont hesitate to email me.

Portugal Bioinformatics
Two research positions in Bioinformatics, Computa-
tional Biology and NGS data analysis
CIBIO-InBIO (http://cibio.up.pt) is a young and
highly dynamic research centre located near Porto,
in Northern Portugal, which conducts world-class re-
search in the elds of biodiversity and evolution. The
Centre oers great opportunities for multidisciplinary
and stimulating research and hosts 18 research groups,
which include over 170 PhD level researchers, and over
100 MSc and PhD students, from many dierent coun-
tries. The working atmosphere is vibrant, multicultural
and enthusiastic, and we host regularly international
scientists for short term visits. The Centre has state of
the art ecology and molecular laboratories (equipped
with multiple PCR rooms, automated sequencers, real-
time PCR machines, etc), and a brand new Illumina
Next-gen Sequencing Platform. Research projects are
performed at a global scale. The Northern region of
Portugal provides rich cultural and outdoor activities
and Porto is a world-heritage city and the capital of
Port wine.
We are currently looking for two talented researchers to
join our research centre to create a new Research Group
in the elds of Bioinformatics/Informatics, Computa-
tional Biology and NGS data analysis. Researchers will
contribute to several research lines and frontier projects
in human genomics, domestication, and challenging de-
novo sequencing projects for non-model species. Candi-
dates from all areas of computational biology and bioin-
formatics will be considered.October 1, 2014 EvolDir 61
Work will involve next-generation sequencing data
analysis, meta-genomics, population genetics, phyloge-
netics and phylogeography. Successful candidates will
be deeply involved in the analysis of whole genomes,
both through re-sequencing of multiple individuals of
species for which there is a reference genome (e.g.
humans, rabbits, dogs), and the assembly of de-novo
genomes (e.g. anthelopes, lizards). They are expected
to deploy and maintain analytic and data management
pipelines, set up standard pipelines for quality control,
assembly, and assembly validation as well as to generate
custom bioinformatics solutions.
We are looking for senior scientists who will be able
to conduct top-level research, establish solid collabora-
tions, and to attract national and international funding.
The positions require a PhD in biology, bioinformat-
ics, computational biology, biostatistics, mathematical
biology, or computer science, 3-5 years post-doctoral
experience, with a strong competence in genome as-
sembly. Expertise in other related NGS-areas are also
of interest. The candidate must have strong computa-
tional skills including prociency in one or more script-
ing languages (e.g. Perl, Python, Ruby) and statis-
tical frameworks (e.g. R, Matlab, SAS, etc.), expe-
rience in bioinformatics, namely in processing high-
throughput sequencing data, scientic programming,
pipeline-development and/or development in the area
of genome assembly, experimental studies and NGS
analysis as well as an understanding of molecular bi-
ology and genetics. A strong knowledge in scripting
and automation of procedures in a Linux environment
is a must for a successful applicant. A good publication
record in SCI journals and a record of funded research
will be extra benecial.
As the candidate will be invited to participate in teach-
ing at the MSc and PhD levels, a history of lecturing
will be considered valuable.
Preference will be given to candidates with a demon-
strated record of developing software and other com-
putational approaches to study biological questions
in the areas of comparative genomics and transcrip-
tomics, evolutionary genomics, phylogenomics, genet-
ics/population genetics, and systems biology and with
experience in leadership roles.
The selected candidates will be the rst members of an
exciting new team that will provide advanced and dedi-
cated bioinformatics/informatics and computational bi-
ology expertise to CIBIO-InBIO. The team will help
genome assembly projects with anything from provid-
ing guidance in the setup and running of assembly
projects to completely running the genome assembly.
They will be key members of CIBIO-InBIO and will beexpected to collaborate with research groups embarking
on genome projects, supporting them with de novo as-
sembly of genomes, including validation of assemblies,
designing genomic experiments, analyzing experimen-
tal data and other related aspects. Any type of raw
data from a wide array of organisms can be expected.
Good communication and writing skills are essential,
and complete uency in English is an absolute require-
ment.
Salary corresponds approximately to a gross annual in-
come of 45000 euros (before taxes).
Applications to any of these positions will include a de-
tailed CV, a research statement and a motivation letter,
as well as the email contact of three referees. Applica-
tions will be open until the positions are

Bee GeneticDierenetiation
Dear EvolDir Members,
As part of a meta-analysis on bee population genetics,
I request information regarding population dierentia-
tion indices in bees. This request is part of a collabora-
tive study between myself, Shalene Jha (Assistant Pro-
fessor in the Department of Integrative Biology at the
University of Texas at Austin), and Margarita L opez-
Uribe (Postdoctoral Researcher at North Carolina State
University).
So far, we have examined studies acquired through the
Web of Science, but we would like to increase our sam-
ple size with the incorporation of additional studies
(published or unpublished).
Specically, we are looking for data sets where bee pop-
ulation genetics analyses have been conducted with:
at least 5 microsatellite markers
at least 20 unrelated individual per population
at least 5 populations
If you have one or more data sets that satisfy these cri-
teria and are willing to contribute, please provide us
with the reference to your work (if published) and the
Fst estimator with 95% CI. We would also be interested
in G'st (Hedrick 1995) and Jost's D (Jost 2008) if you
have those available, too.
Your contribution would obviously be acknowledged
and your publication(s) cited.
We'd like to publicly thank the individuals whom we've
already contacted directly and who generously oered
their data.
Thank you very much in advance

Denaturing ethanol
Dear colleagues,
I would like to order larger amount of ethanol for pre-

costs a fraction of the price of pure one).
The supplier can add denaturing agent of my choice.
Do you have any experience which of the additives are

Microsatellite gels
I am trying to redesign a cladistics laboratory for un-
dergraduate bio majors and want the students to create
their own matrices based on microsatellite data. So,
I'm hoping members of the evoldir community would
be willing to share their old gels{either lms or digital
images. If you are willing to send any old lms, I will
happily pay for mailing them. Our plan is to have the
students generate a simple cladogram using morpho-
logical data and then \test" it using the microsatellite
data.
Thanks so much!

OpenData survey
The Belmont Forum e-Infrastructure Initiative is veryactive through the geological societies and their im-
pact in global dataportals and data sharing. I my-
self am a biologist and would like to contribute with
a stronger impact on the organismal side in the scope
of Future Earth and global biodiversity changes. Thus I
thought the evol-dir mailinglist would be a good place
to ask people from the systematic/evolutionary com-
munity how they use and provide \open data". Surely
we do have GBIF which is great, however so much more
data is out there which we do have to share and combine
with climate and geological data - to better crosslink be-

for additional impact.

Dear all (and with immediate apologies for cross-
posting!),
Please follow the link below to participate in our open
data survey;
Open Data Survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/-
s/Open Data WP5 This survey targets researchers
of various science communities, interested laypersons,
government employees, and others who are providing
and/or using open data in the scope of global envi-
ronmental change, or are planning/interested in doing
so in the future. We invite you to share your views
and experiences on data publishing, access and use.
Based on the results we aim to produce recommen-
dations for research funders on how to support global
e-infrastructures using a coordinated and sustainable
approach - from the planning phase, implementation,
and management of data, analytics and through inter-
national collaboration.
We are interested to learn more about: - Key open
data activities in various communities with global envi-
ronmental change to identify leading examples of best
practice from a user perspective; - Reasons where users'
desire to share can be enhanced by new/other develop-

Phylodynamics of infectious disease epidemics Erik
Volz Imperial College London Thursday, October 2,
2014 9:00 AM PDT
The genetic diversity of many pathogens is shaped by
epidemiological history. But, the dynamics of infectious
disease epidemics dier in important ways from demo-
graphic processes that have traditionally been studied
by population geneticists. In many epidemics, the pop-
ulation size and birth rate changes rapidly in a non-
linear fashion through time. Mathematical models for
describing infectious disease dynamics have a long his-
tory that has run parallel to the development of modern
population genetics, but until recently, there has been
little communication between these elds.Interest has
grown in developing a new set of mathematical models
for genealogies generated by epidemic processes. These
methods reveal how the eective population size of a
pathogen depends on transmission rates, the number
of infected hosts, and the size of the bottleneck at the
time of transmission. These mathematical models have
also enabled new applications of pathogen genetic data
to public health. Pathogen genetic data can be in-
formative about epidemic processes in ways that stan-
dard surveillance data are not, especially regarding the
source of infections and risk factors for transmission. I
will review several approaches to mathematical mod-
eling of pathogen genealogies and present applications
of these methods to HIV-1 and the recent Ebola virus
epidemic in Western Africa.

Provine book
In his new book \The Random Genetic Drift Fal-lacy," William B. Provine challenges random genetic
drift. Provine wrote books about the history of pop-
ulation genetics and Sewall Wright. Fisher's 1922 pa-
per concluded that random genetic drift was inbreeding.
He misunderstood meiosis (1935-1940) in cell division
for gametes. Inbreeding is not random genetic drift.
Fisher's view was supported by Sewall Wright and J.
B. S. Haldane. Their three views of evolution became
the origin of population genetics and continue today.
The experiments of random genetic drift in domestic
populations during the late 1940s and 1950s were in-
breeding. Kimura and Ohta had a major problem with
random genetic drift in small and large populations.
Provine addresses random genetic drift in prokaryotes,
gene pools, selection at one locus, and in laws of physics
applied to population genetics.

Software Lamarc 2 1 10 released
Dear LAMARC users,
We announce the release of Lamarc 2.1.10. This ver-
sion corrects an error in the le conversion program
lamconv when customized migration matrices were
used. The resulting matrices were reversed: that is,
if the user specied the migration rate from A to B,
this actually set the rate from B to A.
If you used an asymmetrical custom migration matrix
in lam conv you will need to re-convert your les and
re-run your analysis. All other results are unaected.
Source code and precompiled executables for Linux,
Windows, and OSX are available on the Lamarc web
site:
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc.html Any
questions or concerns about Lamarc can be directed
to lamarc@uw.edu. We also very much enjoy hearing
about successful use of Lamarc, including any resulting
publications.

BostonU CoralReefFishPopGenetics
*National Science Foundation supported Ph.D. or Post-
doctoral position*
We seek applications for one PhD or Postdoctoral posi-
tion, funded by the NSF project `An Integrative Inves-
tigation of Population Connectivity Using a Coral Reef
Fish.' The position can be based in the Boston Lab in
the Department of Biology at Boston University or the
Webb Lab in the Department of Biology at Colorado
State University.
*Project overview*
Understanding the patterns of marine larval dispersal
and population connectivity is central to understand-
ing marine population dynamics, marine population di-
vergence, and how to design eective networks of ma-
rine reserves. Over the last decade, three methods,
each of which tells us something slightly dierent, have
emerged as the leading contenders to provide the great-92 EvolDir October 1, 2014
est insights into marine population connectivity: direct
genetic methods, coupled biophysical models, and in-
direct genetic methods. We are conducting an inte-
grative investigation of population connectivity, using
all three methods, in one very tractable system: the
neon goby, *Elacatinus lori*, on the Belizean Barrier
Reef. The research has three main objectives: 1) deter-
mine the relationship between distance and the proba-
bility of successful dispersal measured using direct ge-
netic methods; 2) determine the relationship between
the probability of successful dispersal predicted by cou-
pled biophysical models and that measured using direct
genetic methods; and, 3) determine the relationship be-
tween spatial genetic structure predicted by evolution-
ary ecology models and that measured using indirect
genetic methods.
*Position description*
The PhD or postdoc will work on objective 3 of the
project, developing evolutionary ecology models that
use data on patterns of larval dispersal to predict pat-
terns of genetic structure. The candidate will have
strong interests in ecology and evolution and a strong
quantitative and computational background. We en-
courage applications from students in mathematics,
physics, engineering and computer science who have
demonstrable interest applying their skills in the elds
of ecology and evolution, as well as applications from
students in biology, ecology, evolution and marine sci-
ence with an excellent quantitative and computational
background.
*How to apply*
To apply, please e-mail Katie Hartmann (ka-
hartma@rams.colostate.edu) with PDFs of your CV,
transcript, GRE results, and a one page statement of
your career aspirations and why you are interested in
the position. If you have further questions about the
position, please contact Peter Buston (buston@bu.edu)

CambridgeUK ButteryGenomics
Bioinformatics
Genomics postdoc to study buttery speciation, with
exibility for the candidate to pursue their own inter-
ests within the broad goals of the project.
A post-doctoral research associate position in Depart-
ment of Zoology, located in Central Cambridge on
Downing Street, is available from October 2014 for
twenty four months, in the rst instance, to work with
Professor Chris Jiggins on the evolutionary genomics of
adaptation and speciation in Heliconius butteries, in
collaboration with Dr Owen McMillan at the Smithso-
nian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. There are
three important aspects of the position. First, we are
looking for someone to work with the larger Heliconius
community to nalize the construction of the H. erato
genome. This genome will be the second full genome
sequence available in Heliconius, alongside H. erato's
co-mimic, H. melpomene, and will provide a founda-
tion for broader comparative genomic studies across the
radiation.
This work will primarily involve validating and improv-
ing an existing assembly using genetic linkage data.
Second, we are looking for someone to produce a draft
assembly of the H. cydno genome for comparison to
the H. melpomene and H. erato genomes. The Post-
doctoral Research Associate will then use these refer-
ence genomes to study adaptation and speciation in
the genus. This could include demographic analysis of
mimicry and speciation using coalescence-based meth-
ods to infer population history from whole-genome se-
quences and/or analysis of genomic rearrangements and
their role in speciation, inferred from population rese-
quence data for H. erato and H. melpomene species
groups. There is considerable scope for the focus of the
biological analyses to reect the interests of the candi-
date.
The research will primarily involve bioinformatic anal-
ysis of existing genomic sequence datasets. The suc-
cessful applicant should have a Ph.D., completed or
completion imminent, in evolutionary biology, bioinfor-
matics or a related eld, with a strong interest in pop-
ulation genomics. In addition, candidates should have
experience with the manipulation and analysis of Illu-
mina data and working knowledge of a programming
language such as Python or Perl.Candidates should have a good collaborative spirit,
as the work will involve close collaboration with re-
searchers in Cambridge and Panama as well as coor-
dination with many dierent labs working on Helico-
nius biology, genome assembly and genome databases.
Enthusiasm, determination and the capacity to work
independently are also essential.
Fixed-term: The funds for this post are available for 24
months in the rst instance.

TARA Oceans is a multidisciplinary project
with 24 teams over 10 countries ( http://-
oceans.taraexpeditions.org/en/), covering oceanogra-
phy, bioinformatics, chemistry, microbiology, physics&
genomics, aiming to collect and analyze marine plank-
tonic organisms up to 2 mm (viruses, prokaryotes,
protists and metazoans). These marine organisms
are key actors on several large biogeochemical cycles
(nitrogen, carbon or oxygen among others) as well as
on marine food chain. During a three years journey
across the globe, 210 sampling stations covering the
main oceanographic regions were conducted (Karsenti
E. PLoS Biol. 2011). A key step in this project con-
sists in describing the planktonic community through
genomic material recovered from sampled organisms in
order to characterize its diversity and to understand
environmental factors shaping the population.
A large sequencing eort is undergone at
CEA/Genoscope to determine both genomic (gene con-
tent of the dierent populations) and transcriptomic
(the active part of the genes catalog) signatures in all94 EvolDir October 1, 2014
gathered samples. From this data, gene catalogs are
built and used to describe both taxonomic distribution
and functional diversity of the populations, and to
detect uctuations between samples.
In the context, we are looking for a highly motivated
and talented candidate. This candidate will have to
demonstrate perfect skill in: . functional analysis of
eukaryotes metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data.
. statistical analysis of large scale, complex and hetero-
geneous data. . communication with collaborating labs
for integration of data.
The candidate would have to handle an existing dataset
to elucidate functional response of planktonic popula-
tion to perturbations in the environment. This line of
work will be subsequently applied to other sample sets
with related scientic questions.
Solid knowledge in the following areas will be a
plus: . high throughput data manipulation under a
Unix/Linux environment . programming skills for data
treatment (shell / perl / python) . statistical analysis
of genomic data (R knowledge is a plus) . biological
interpretation of functional data.

vacancy/1254519/96871?iso=no Project description
The primary objective of this project is to investigate
how Viking trade and agriculture have shaped the ge-
nomic composition of plants and animals, and increase
our understanding of the evolutionary heritage left in
contemporary varieties. We focus on species of pro-
found agricultural, cultural and industrial importance
(horse, ax and barley) for which excellent genomic
tools have recently been developed. In this project
we have access to unique samples from dierent coun-
tries that will be analyzed using whole genome, high-
throughput sequencing approaches. The successful ap-
plicant will join a multi-disciplinary, international team
that brings together experts from the elds of biol-
ogy, archaeology and palaeontology. Furthermore, this
project forms a close collaboration between the CEES,
the Natural History Museum (NHM) and the Museum
of Cultural History (KHM) at the University of Oslo.
Requirements Applicants must hold a PhD-degree (or
other corresponding education equivalent to a Norwe-
gian doctoral degree) with a background within popu-
lation genomics, evolutionary genomics and/or ancient
DNA research. The candidate should be able to docu-
ment strong analytical skills and experience in the lab-
oratory. Experience with ancient DNA, analytical or
experimental, will be an advantage.
The candidate will work in close collaboration with the
rest of the team at CEES, NHM and KHM, as well as
our national and international partners (Denmark and
Great Britain) within this project. Some time will be
spent visiting the collaborating partners overseas. We
seek a highly motivated, enthusiastic person with the
ambition to gain insight and publish papers in leading,
international journals, and in possession of good inter-
personal skills and willing to work in close collaboration
with others.
The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has
a strategic ambition of being a leading research faculty.
Candidates for these fellowships will be selected in ac-
cordance with this, and expected to be in the upper
segment of their class with respect to academic creden-
tials.

InstitutPasteur ViralEvolution
Two years post-doctoral positions now are available at
the Institut Pasteur of Paris, with possibility of exten-
sion.
These post-docs will be funded by an ERC ve-year
project EVOMOBIL (PI, Patrick Forterre) that started
in February 2014 (see summary of the project)
The aim is to study coevolution of mobile elements
(viruses/plasmids) and cells in the domain Archaea.
The two positions are for the in silico part of the
project. The hired post-doc will work together with
a strong team including David Prangishvili, Mart
Krupovic, Simonetta Gribaldo and Jacques Oberto. We
are looking for post-docs broadly interested in virus
evolution with expertises in phylogenomics and/or
database creation and management, etc.
The two postdoctoral students will be hired by the In-
stitut Pasteur (IP) to work at the IP in Paris and/or
at the Institut of Integrated Cellular Biology (I2BC) in
Orsay.
Interactions between cells, viruses and derived ele-
ments, such as plasmids, have played a major role in
life evolution. However, up to now, evolutionary stud-
ies have mainly focused on cellular genomes (building
species trees). My project is to reconstruct the history
of interaction between cells, viruses and plasmid (VP)
on grand scale to tackle questions such as: to which ex-
tent VP co-evolved with their hosts? To which extent
cellular history was inuenced by the introduction of
PV genomes? What is the main directionality of genes
ux between PV and cells? The project will focus on
Archaea, one of the three domains of life, because it is
the only domain for which a robust phylogeny is avail-
able (a prerequisite for the project). We will perform an
exhaustive description of viral and plasmid families in
all available archaeal genomes (Including new genomes
sequenced for the project) using a combination of in
silico methods. Phylogenetic and network analyses will
be used to reconstruct the history of viral and plasmid
replicons with the objective to quantify horizontal ver-
sus vertical evolution and to sort out the web and tree-
like components of archaeal history. Preliminary anal-
yses have revealed the importance of horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) in archaeal evolution. However, the
processes behind these HGT remain mysterious, espe-102 EvolDir October 1, 2014
cially for hyperthermophilic species. In parallel to our
in silico analyses we will explore experimentally the
possible role of membrane vesicles (MV) in HGT. We
have shown that archaeal MVs can transfer DNA and
that some of them harbour plasmid or viral genomes.
We want now tackle questions such as: can these MVs
transfer DNA between dierent species, dierent or-
ders or even dierent domains? We will also study the
mechanism of MV formation and fusion in comparison
to those involved in viral infection to better understand
the evolutionary and physiological connections between
MV and PV. Production of MV is a universal process
and their role in life evolution could have been largely
underestimated up to now.

MNHN Paris EvolutionVenom
Postdoc position in phylogeny and macroevolution of
venomous organisms Speciation and diversication in
venomous organisms are often associated with prey and
toxin diversication. In the conoideans, a group of ma-
rine gastropods predators of worms, molluscs and sh,
studied since 40 years for the potential therapeutic ap-
plications of the toxins they produce, it is generally ac-
cepted that the apparition of the venom apparatus ex-
plain the high species diversity in this group. However,
the number of species and the distribution area varies
among lineages, and the apparition of the venom appa-
ratus in itself cannot explain these dierences. Recent
studies showed that the structure of the venom appa-
ratus, including the morphology of the radula and the
presence of accessory anatomical structures, together
with the toxin composition of the venom, can also vary
among lineages. The goal of the project is thus to (i)
estimate the rates of diversication in the Conoidea toeventually detect variations in time and among lineages,
and (ii) correlate these variations with various charac-
ters linked to the venom apparatus (morpho-anatomy,
toxin composition).
This project is part of the ANR program CONOTAX
(ANR-13-JSV7-0013-01) whose objective is to under-
stand the process of diversication in the Conoidea,
both at the phylogenetic and species level, combining
the analysis of the species diversity, the prey diver-
sity and the toxin diversity. More info can be found
on the CONOTAX website (https://sites.google.com/-
site/conotax/ The post-doc will be in charge of the
constitution of the dataset and the analyses: phylo-
genetic reconstruction, datation and estimation of di-
versication rates and correlation with character evo-
lution. The rst step of the work will thus be to com-
plete the available molecular phylogeny of the groups.
All the known families are represented in the collec-
tions of the MNHN (National Museum of Natural His-
tory), but expeditions on the eld are already planned
for 2015, at which the post-doc could participate. The
methodology used until now (Sanger sequencing of tra-
ditional genes for gastropods COI, 12S, 16S, 28S, H3,
18S) does not resolve the deeper nodes, and the post-
doc will thus have to set up a new methodology for the
group using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Three
approaches will be explored: sequencing of complete
mitochondrial genomes, sequencing of transcriptomes,
and exon-capture. Available fossils for the group will
then be used to date the tree and rates of diversication
will be estimated.
The successful candidate will be funded by the CONO-
TAX program (Net salary: 2,200 per month) and
hosted in the Service de Syst ematique Mol eculaire and
the UMR7205 / ISYEB, in the MNHN of Paris. It is
a one-year position that can be extended for another
year, and it will start on January 1st, 2015.
Applicants should have: - a PhD degree in a relevant
eld - experience with molecular laboratory techniques,
and in particular NGS - a good knowledge in molecular
phylogeny and in phylogenetic approaches for studying
diversication - a good scientic publication record -
a good capacity to handle a scientic project, interact
with other members of the lab and a willingness to train
students.
How to apply: send a full CV (including a list of your
skills relevant for the position and a list of publications)
and a 2-3 pages document to explain how you would
handle the project, and in particular what strategy you
would apply to resolve the phylogeny of the Conoidea.

Montpellier GifsurYvette
MicrobialEvolution
A post-doctoral position is available for two years, on
the following project, 'Dynamics of yeasts and lactic
acid bacteria interactions in sourdoughs ecosystems'.
The postdoctoral researcher will work in collaboration
with two research groups, one located in Montpellier,
the other in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.
Project The community dynamics of an ecological niche
is driven partly by selection and by complementation
interaction between organisms. These interactions have
been studied extensively for social organisms, or host-
parasites interactions. Microbial species interactions
in food-processing systems have drawn less attention.
Sourdough, which includes less than ten species accord-
ing to published studies, appears as a relatively simple
model for studying positive and negative interactions.
In sourdoughs, Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeasts
are always found together suggesting ecological facilita-
tion between these prokayotes and eukaryotes. By con-
trast, within LAB and within yeasts, we observe a dom-
inant species suggesting that competition drives the dy-
namics of the species diversity. The post-doctoral fellow
will conduct experimental and mathematical modeling
studies to understand: i) how yeast species and LAB
species interact during the fermentation process; and ii)
whether yeasts and LAB associations enhance the re-
silience of the sourdough community to the colonization
by the commercial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The
dynamics of sourdough ecosystems and its resilience to
commercial yeast will be analysed both experimentally
by microbial community monitoring and mathemati-
cally by modelling population dynamics in sourdough
microbial community.
Requirements The successful candidate will have a PhD
in ecology or microbiology and will demonstrate inter-
est and abilities for both experimental and theoreti-
cal work. Ideally, the candidate will have skills in
microbiology, ecology, mathematical modeling of sys-
tems dynamics, statistical analysis and R program-
ming. He/she will also show enthusiasm for interdisci-
plinary research and ability to communicate eectively
with other scientists at the interface of empirical andtheoretical studies.
Research environment The position is funded
by a French interdisciplinary project untitled
'Diversity and interactions in a low-input '
Wheat/Human/Sourdough' agro-food ecosystem:
toward a better understanding of bakery sustain-
ability' (Project ANR BAKERY, 2014-2018). This
project includes eight academic partners with com-
plementary skills (bio-mathematics, plant genetics,
microbiology, sociology, centre for genetic resources
managements) as well as bakers and farmers/bakers.
The experimental part of the post-doctoral project
will be carried out in the research group 'Yeasts
diversity and adaptation to anthropic environment'
on the Supagro campus in Montpellier (http://-
www6.montpellier.inra.fr/spo eng/Presentation) and
the modeling part will be done in the research group
'Fundamental Quantitative Genetics' in Gif-sur-Yvette
(http://moulon.inra.fr/index.php/en/team/genetique-

FY15 MarineGEO Postdoctoral Fellowship Proposals
Submission Deadline: December 1, 2014 The Smith-
sonian ^A1s Tennenbaum Marine Observatories Network108 EvolDir October 1, 2014
(TMON) invites proposals for Postdoctoral Fellowships
that will advance goals of the Marine Global Earth
Observatory. MarineGEO is a developing partner-
ship among diverse organizations united by focus on
global-scale, long-term study of coastal biodiversity and
ecosystems using standardized approaches. Marine-
GEO is coordinated by TMON, which includes the
Smithsonian Environmental Research Center on the
Chesapeake Bay (SERC), the Smithsonian Marine Sta-
tion on the Indian River Lagoon in Florida (SMSFP),
the Carrie Bow Cay Marine Field Station in Belize
(CCRE Program), and sites in Caribbean and Pacic
Panama administered by the Smithsonian Tropical Re-
search Institute (STRI). Additional partner sites are
under development. Eligibility and Award Amount.
Postdoctoral scientists must collaborate directly with
two or more Smithsonian scientists as named spon-
sors (see Smithsonian Marine Research Sta at http:/-
/www.si.edu/marinescience/sta.htm) and must select
co-Advisors from more than one SI unit (NMNH,
SMSFP, SERC, STRI, NZP). Stipend is $48,000 per
year with an allowance for health insurance, travel,
and supplies up to a total $60,000 maximum (including
stipend) per year. Awards will be made for a maximum
of two years, pending rst-year performance review.
Proposals must focus on comparative research related
to MarineGEO goals (http://www.si.edu/marinegeo)
and involve at least two TMON facilities. Applicants
must have completed the Ph.D. before commencing
the fellowship. Individuals who have been employees
at the Smithsonian within the previous year are not
eligible. Applicants are strongly encouraged to con-
tact prospective sponsors in developing their propos-
als. MarineGEO goals. MarineGEO and TMON are
dedicated to understanding change in and relationships
among the biodiversity, structure, and functioning of
marine ecosystems at local through global scales. Our
research aims to advance scientic capacity for fore-
casting change and informing policy. A cornerstone of
MarineGEO is the use of standardized, repeated mea-
surements and experiments, maintained over decades,
conducted across the Smithsonian ^A1s facilities and an
expanding global network of diverse partners. This
approach is designed to achieve rigorous comparative
understanding across space and time, to understand
variation in coastal marine ecosystems, and to assess
links between local and global environmental forcing,
biodiversity, and functioning of ecosystems. We seek
applications for Postdoctoral research projects that ad-
dress at least one of TMON ^A1s overarching research
themes: 1. How does marine biodiversity vary through
space and time across the globe? 2. How do natu-
ral and human forces (e.g. shing, land-use, invasions,
habitat loss) drive changes in marine biodiversity andecosystem functioning and resilience? 3. What are the
consequences for human well-being of these changes in
marine ecosystems? 4. How does anthropogenic alter-
ation of carbon cycles aect coastal marine systems and
ecosystem service provision? 5. How are marine ecosys-
tems connected via dispersal and metapopulation dy-
namics, and how do these connections aect responses
to change and human well-being? 6. How do nearshore
food webs change through space and time? 7. How can
the past^ a1ancient through historic^ a1help us understand
the consequences of local human activities and global
change? 8. Where are the critical tipping points that
lead to rapid and unwanted shifts in marine ecosystems,
and how can these best be avoided? Proposal submis-
sion. Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to

ExperimentalFlagellumEvolution
Post-doc: Experimental Evolution of the Bacterial
Flagellar Motor
Description We are looking for a post-doc (two years)
to bring a highly promising, ongoing line of research
on modular protein-complex evolution to fruition. The
project examines how evolution incorporates incom-
patible components into the bacterial agellar motor.
Using engineered motors, we followed component inte-
gration during real-time evolution experiments. Next-
generation sequencing and phenotypic analyses have
begun to reveal the underlying evolutionary trajecto-
ries. The main challenge of the post-doc will be to
dissect the mutational trajectories and associated phe-
notypic changes in order to generate new insight into
the mechanisms of modular protein-complex evolution.
The post-doc will also be encouraged to test existing
and newly developed hypotheses (e.g. on the evolu-
tion of 'irreducible' complexity) using this experimental
model.
Requirements Qualied candidates have a PhD in
molecular (micro)biology, experimental ecology and
evolution, biophysics, synthetic biology or a related
eld. In addition, they have a strong interest in ex-
perimental evolutionary research and are motivated by
a deep scientic curiosity. Successful candidates have
experience with (bacterial) genetics techniques, good
experimental skills and a drive to learn new methods
and concepts.
Research Group The Beaumont Lab seeks insight into
the mechanisms behind the creative potential of evo-
lution by mutation and selection from the nanoscale
to the ecosystem level. We do this using real-time
evolution and ecology experiments, synthetic biology
and biophysics in combination with a range of bac-
terial model systems. Current research topics in-
clude the ecology and evolution of conductive bacterial
nanowires, the evolutionary origins of biodiversity, and
modular evolution of multi-protein complexes.

ClonalInterference
Postdoc position in eco-evolutionary theory
A postdoc position is available to work with PI Joanna
Masel (http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at
the University of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist
destination surrounded on all four sides by mountain-
ous national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city
of nearly a million people with an attractive climate.
The EEB department in Tucson was ranked in the top
10 by US News & World Report.
The postdoc will study evolutionary rescue in the pres-
ence of clonal interference, via a model of asexual pop-
ulation genetics (based on Desai & Fisher 2007). This
model will be modied so that genotypes specify abso-
lute tness in a deteriorating environment, rather than
relative tness as is the norm in population genetics.
The project is part of a broader eort to integrate the
ecological density-dependence terms r and K with the
classical population genetics tness term of w, as part of
an eco-evo theoretical synthesis: see http://arxiv.org/-
abs/1407.1024 for the conceptual basis. We are just
beginning an experimental evolution collaboration, and
side projects applying the model to experimental evolu-
tion (and to other ecological and evolutionary theory)
are encouraged. A strong quantitative background to-
gether with computational and/or modeling experience
is required. A background in evolutionary and/or eco-
logical theory is strongly preferred.
The Masel group's main research interests http:/-

UArizona EvolvabilityTheory
Postdoc position in the theory of molecular errors and
evolvability
A postdoc position is available to work with Joanna
Masel (http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel) at
the University of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist
destination surrounded on all four sides by mountain-
ous national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city
of nearly a million people with an attractive climate.
The EEB department in Tucson was ranked in the top
10 by US News & World Report.
All molecular processes, from transcription to protein
interactions, are subject to errors. We are interested in
exploring the evolutionary consequences of this simple
fact. In previous work (Rajon & Masel 2011 PNAS),
we found that the evolution of error rates tends towards
two extremes. One attractor represents a global proof-
reading solution that avoids making errors at many loci
at once, the other a local robustness solution, where er-
rors happen at high rates but the consequences of each
error have evolved, one locus at a time, to be benign.
Populations that evolved benign, co-optable cryptic se-
quences via the local solution are much more evolv-
able. This is because through the erroneous expression
of cryptic sequences, selection has already explored and
prescreened possible future mutations. In other words,
because errors in gene expression and in replication (i.e.
mutation) are so similar at the molecular level, selection
can actually occur prior to mutation.
We are looking for a postdoc to study evolvability phe-
nomena in versions of this model, and also investi-
gate controversial hypotheses surrounding the adaptive
evolution of evolvability. A strong quantitative back-
ground, good programming skills, and previous model-
ing experience are all required. A background in evo-
lutionary theory is strongly preferred. Some interest in
the molecular biology of transcription, translation, pro-
tein folding and binding, and the errors in each of these
processes is an advantage. The position is available im-
mediately, and is renewable, with funding secured forat least two years.

group Anastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae).
The primary goal of the project is to understand the
nature of variation underlying traits that distinguish
species (including major ecologically relevant traits as
well as traits potentially involved in mate recognition)
and how the species dierences relate to within species
variation.
The postdoc will contribute to empirical and compu-
tational components of the project. There is consid-
erable exibility and opportunities for the postdoc to
make major contributions to the direction of the re-
search program. Experimental work under this project
includes RNA-seq approaches to understanding gene
expression in hybrids and multigenerational breeding
schemes aimed at mapping variation associated with
species dierences.

UHaifa Bioinformatics
Post-Doc Positions at the Institute of Evolution, Uni-
versity of Haifa, Haifa, Israel
We are looking for independent, motivated, diligent, la-
borious, dedicated Bioinformaticians as post-doctorate
fellows for a project aimed at revealing the mechanisms
of cancer-resistance and anti-cancer activity of the
hypoxia-tolerant subterranean, blind mole-rat, Spalax
along its underground evolutionary adaptations. Our
project has captured the interest of the scientic com-
munity and we have ample nancial support for the
studies. Generous fellowships ($30K to $40K according
to qualications and performance) are available, imme-
diately, for Post-Docs experts in bioinformatics with
a background of good understanding biological ques-
tions. That is that can independently handle raw out-
put data of RNA-seq / miR seq/ Genomic, analyze it
and can interpret intelligently the relevant biological
background. Outstanding candidates for PhD experi-
enced in Bioinformatics will also be considered. Famil-
iarity with cancer research is an advantage. Experience
of writing manuscripts for publication and a publica-
tion record in relevant journals are expected. English
skills both oral and written are required. American,
Western-European or Israeli education is a signicant
benet.
Scientic background: We are working with the
hypoxia-tolerant (down to 3% O2), long-lived ( >20
years) subterranean blind mole-rat, Spalax, which
shows an outstanding cancer-resistance and anti-cancer
capabilities. Observations of thousands of individuals
at our Institute have never noticed a spontaneous ma-
lignant tumor. Furthermore, we have found in Spalax,
compared to other above-ground, hypoxia-sensitive,
short-lived species, dierent structure and function of
major genes related to cancer (p53, heparanase, genes
of antioxidant defense and DNA-repair genes). Assess-
ment of Spalax transcriptome assembly and expression
data has revealed enrichment of genes that overlap can-
cer resistance, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and hypoxia-
tolerance and elicits much wider and stronger expres-
sion in Spalax than in rat (Malik et al, 2012, BMC
genomics, 13, 615). Moreover, Spalax has shown ex-
tremely high cancer-resistance to chemical carcinogens
that induced cancer in 100% of mice and rats. Most in-
triguing, broblast cells only from Spalax, but not from
other species, inhibit growth and kill cancer cells, butnot normal cells, from various tissues and species, most
importantly a wide range of human cancer cells. This
is exhibited in both co-culture system or by exposure
to factors secreted into conditioned media harvested
from Spalax broblasts. Decreased cancer cell viabil-
ity and proliferation, reduced colony formation in soft
agar, disturbed cell cycle progression, chromatin con-
densation, nuclei deformation and mitochondrial frag-
mentation were reproducibly observed (Manov et al.,
2013, BMC biology 11, 91). Our present objectives
is to identify and isolate the substances secreted by
Spalax cells, resolve with which components they in-
teract that are active only on cancer cells, in order to
unravel the biological mechanisms and pathways that
evolved in Spalax cell machinery and ultimately lead to
the death of cancer-cells. The study could attest to be
a breakthrough in cancer research, using the long lived,
hypoxia- and cancer-tolerant Spalax as a signicant bi-
ological resource for biomedical research that hopefully
could open new horizons in treatment and prevention
of cancer in humans.

R package for analyzing and visualizing evolutionary
dynamics from BAMM output (see examples of analy-
ses and visualization with BAMMtools on the BAMM
project website).
The ideal candidate will have a background in quan-
titative methods in evolutionary biology and/or com-
putational biology. Demonstrable programming abil-
ity in C/C++ and/or R is required (C++ essential for

weeds and fungi. This project will use the availability
of recent complete genome sequences to reconstruct the
protein repertoire encoded in the last common eukary-
otic ancestor to understand the biology of this ancient
cell and identify how this repertoire was augmented,
reduced or modied during the diversication into the
main eukaryotic lineages.
The work is part of an award made by the Leverhulme
Trust for a collaborative project between two groupswith a proven track record in evolutionary cell biology.
The appointee will join the research group of Dr Bill
Wickstead in the School of Life Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Nottingham, but will also be required to work
in collaboration with a post-doctoral researcher in the
group of Dr Tom Richards at the University of Exeter.
Candidates must hold, or be near to completion of, a
PhD (or equivalent) in comparative genomics, evolu-
tionary biology or another area of biology with a strong
computational or bioinformatic component. It is es-
sential that they can demonstrate outstanding skills in
analysis of genomic data, but also have an excellent
understanding of cell biology. Applications from strong
candidates with a track-record including publications
in either or both of these areas are particularly encour-
aged.

A full-time post-doctoral position is open in the eld of
Molecular Systematics in a research group led by Ph.D.
Marko Mutanen in the Biodiversity Unit of the Univer-
sity of Oulu, Finland.
This project applies state-of-the-art high-throughput
sequencing technology (next-generation sequencing)
and genome-wide analyses to seek answers to poorly
understood but repeatedly reported phenomena in mi-
tochondrial DNA, particularly the DNA barcode re-
gion (COI). The research will focus on examining e.g.
evolutionary causes of DNA barcode sharing between
species, deep intraspecic splits in mtDNA and species-
level para- and polyphyly in mtDNA gene trees using
Lepidoptera (butteries and moths) as a model group.
Moreover, the project also concentrates on a large-scale
and dicult taxonomic challenge of delimitation of al-
lopatric populations. The results are anticipated to pro-
vide new insights into problems related to species delim-
itation, DNA taxonomy and other fundamental ques-
tions of taxonomy. The project will be conducted in
collaboration with a broad international team of lead-
ing experts of Lepidoptera systematics.
A successful applicant must have a Ph.D. degree and
should have previous research experience in the eld
of molecular taxonomy and/or phylogenetics. Exper-
tize and practical skills in DNA barcoding, genet-
ics, genomic data analyses, next-generation sequencing
techniques and bioinformatics are highly appreciated,
though a successful applicant does not need to be an
expert in all these elds. An applicant should be highly
motivated, ready to commit themselves to the project,
and have good skills in English language.

Uppsala University hereby declares the following posi-
tion to be open for application:
Postdoctoral Researcher in Evolutionary Biology
(*UFV-PA 2014/2602)*
at the Animal Ecology Program, the Department of
Ecology and Genetics, Evolutionary Biology Centre
(EBC) with starting date being November 1st, 2014, or
as soon as possible after this date. The Evolutionary
Biology Center hosts one of the world's largest aggrega-
tions of evolutionary biologists, and is a prime research
environment for a wide range of elds in evolutionary
biology (see \http://www.ebc.uu.se/" for more infor-
mation). The working atmosphere is very international
with English as our operational language. Uppsala Uni-
versity is the oldest university in Scandinavia and the
city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with beauti-
ful surroundings conveniently situated 40 minutes with
train from Stockholm.
*Brief research outline: **The research will aim at im-
proving our understanding of the evolution of **male
accessory reproductive gland proteins (acps)**. Male
acps act as hormones and have profound eects on fe-
male physiology and behaviour. These proteins are
some of the most rapidly evolving proteins known to
science and the genes encoding acps are candidate \spe-
ciation genes" in several groups of insects. In this
project, seed beetles will serve as a new model system
for acps and the research will prot both from ongoing
proteomic work and from extant drafts of the transcrip-
tome and the genome of the main model species. The
goal is to improve our understanding of the genetic and
environmental sources of variation in seminal uid pro-October 1, 2014 EvolDir 123
tein production and to characterize selection upon the
loci encoding these proteins.***
*This post*doctoral position forms a part of an ongoing
project on genetic conict, funded by the European Re-
search Council and the Swedish Research Council. The
entire project currently employs some 5-6 postdocs and
3 PhD students, apart from a full time TA and the PI,
and we strongly encourage interactions and collabora-
tions within the group.
*Salary and appointment*: Period of appointment is
two years. Uppsala University adopts an individual
salary policy but the starting salary for postdoctoral
researchers is typically about 30.000 SEK per month
and includes full social benets.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate must have a
Ph.D, or an exam which is judged comparable to a
PhD, that was completed within three years of the ap-
plication deadline. Applicants that received their PhD
earlier than this date will be considered if special cir-
cumstances exist (such as prolonged periods of illness,
parental leave, military service, union duties and others
of similar character).
*Qualications and merits*: We seek candidates with
a documented expertise in comparative or experimen-
tal proteomics, preferably using reproductive proteins.
Familiarity and experience with a variety of proteomic
techniques is required as is a rm background in evolu-
tionary biology. Experience of laboratory work with in-
sects will also be considered a merit. Because the holder
of this position will collaborate and interact closely with
other members of our interactive group, we will put em-
phasis on both independence and ability to collaborate.
*To apply:*Candidates should submit a cover letter, a
curriculum vitae including a list of publications and a
short (1-3 pages) description of past research accom-
plishments and future research ambitions. Applicants
should also include names and e-mail addresses of two

EvolEcolGenomMaternalEects
Postdoc position in Evolutionary Ecology & Genomics
of Maternal Eects University of Zurich, Switzerland
My group combines complementary approaches from
behavioural and evolutionary ecology, ecophysiology
and genomics to understand the evolution and evolu-
tionary consequences of prenatal maternal eects in
dierent bird system. Within this project, I have a
postdoc position available to investigate the genetic ba-
sis of prenatal maternal investment using established
Japanese quail selection lines for high and low mater-nal egg investment.
Goal of the project is to identify genomic regions associ-
ated with dierential maternal investment, and to link
DNA sequence and gene expression variation with the
physiological and ecological phenotype of mothers from
high and low investment lines to obtain an integrative
understanding of the molecular and physiological archi-
tecture underlying variation in maternal reproductive
strategies. Side projects based on the selection lines
are possible and encouraged.
The ideal candidate for this project has a background
in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and / or
genetics, and previous experience with genomics and
bioinformatics (or a very strong interest to learn).
The postdoc will be based at the Institute of Evo-
lutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of the
University of Zurich, providing ample opportunities
for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary elds (http:/-
/www.ieu.uzh.ch). The institute is very international
and the working language is English.
The position is funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation for the duration of two years (gross salary
CHF 94'000 per annum). The ideal starting date is
early 2015.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlin-
ing your motivation to work on this project as well
as relevant experience, 2) a detailed curriculum vi-
tae, and 3) the contact details of three academic ref-
erees. Send the above as a single .pdf le to bar-
bara.tschirren@ieu.uzh.ch

InstructionsOctober 1, 2014 EvolDir 131
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
