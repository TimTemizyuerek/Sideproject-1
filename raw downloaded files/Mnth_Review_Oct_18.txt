may be changed from oral to poster, according to the
recommendations and ranking by the Scientic Com-
mittee. Abstracts must be submitted online at https://-
www.woodpeckers2019.com, where participants can also
register and nd other important information (accom-
modation, venue, deadlines, fees, etc.).
The conference will focus on the conservation and ecol-
ogy of woodpeckers and will be jointly organized by
Siedlce University, Museum and Institute of Zoology
PAS Warsaw, Opole University, Adam Mickiewicz Uni-
versity Pozna n, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (allPoland) and the Special Interest Group (SIG) Wood-
peckers of the German Ornithological Society (DO-G).
The conference aims to bring together woodpecker re-
searchers from across the globe and to provide an in-
ternational forum for discussion on how woodpecker
research may improve our understanding of behavior,
ecology and conservation sciences. Please spread the
word about it!

ESEB2019 Finland CallForSymposia
Nov15 Deadline
Submissions for symposium proposals for ESEB 2019
(to be held in Finland from 19-23.8.2019) are now open
(deadline 15.11.2018).
A dening feature of ESEB congresses is the \bottom-up"
approach to determining the scientic content of each
meeting. The vast majority of the scientic program is4 EvolDir October 1, 2018
arranged in symposia topics that are suggested by ESEB
members, and the symposium organisers then also play a
major role in selecting the oral and poster presentations
from the submitted abstracts. Symposia topics can be
on any theme related to evolutionary biology: specic
or broad, emerging or well established. A symposium
normally consists of around 5-12 oral presentations, of
which 1-2 are invited, with remaining abstracts in the
theme being presented together in the poster sessions.
Invited speakers typically have their congress registra-
tion covered (but not travel or accommodation), and
have extended speaking time.
Symposia proposals can be submitted at: https://-
eseb2019./symposia-and-abstracts You will be asked
to provide:
- The names and email addresses of the primary organiser
(for all communication) and max. two co-organiser(s)
(as a replacement), who must be committed to attend
the whole meeting. - The proposed symposium title.
- A max 200-word explanation justifying why you feel
your proposed topic warrants a symposium at the con-
ference. - The names of two invited speakers (please
check beforehand whether they are indeed available).
Balance, in terms of gender, nationality and career stage
of invited speakers and symposium organisers will be in-
cluded as one criterion used by the scientic committee
when selecting symposia and successful symposium or-
ganisers are expected to do the same when selecting oral
presentations. More details on ESEB's equal opportu-
nity policies are available on the symposium submission
page. ESEB also supports diversity via conference at-
tendance aid grants.
Please note that symposium organisers are not allowed
to present in the symposium they organise.
The deadline for submission is November 15, 2018. Pro-
posals will be double-blind evaluated by the Scientic
Committee, and the selected list will be communicated
in January 2019.
Enquiries about symposium preproposals should be di-
rected to craig.primmer@helsinki..

Many organisms across the tree of life have complex
life cycles that include both sexual and asexual repro-

speakers have been untangling the evolutionary eects
of using one or both of these disparate reproductive
modes.

We are pleased to announce that registration and ab-
stract submission to Trends in Biodiversity and Evolu-
tion 2018 ARE NOW OPEN.
TiBE2018 will be devoted to HOST-PARASITE INTER-
ACTIONS. Globalization and ongoing climate change
have brought new opportunities for disease spread and
parasite/pathogen evolution. Concomitantly recent
methodological advances presently allow overcoming
most of the previous limitations on parasites detection,
providing exciting opportunities for a better understand-
ing of parasite communities and the interaction between
these organisms and their hosts.
During four sessions, we will approach ongoing research
on dierent aspects of host-parasite interactions: evolu-
tion and diversity of parasites, host-parasite molecular
and ecological interactions, epidemiology and current
challenges. We believe that this is an excellent opportu-
nity to share and disseminate the cutting-edge research
currently being done in this eld. The conference will
take place on 5-7 December, 2018 at CIBIO-InBIO fa-
cilities in Vair ao, Portugal. It will include 4 invited
plenary talks, 16 oral communications (to be selected)
and poster sessions.

Dear colleagues;
We (Jose Eirin-Lopez and Hollie Putnam) are organiz-
ing the special session \Environmental epigenetics: key
mechanisms of acclimatization and adaptation to global
ocean change " as part of the 2019 ASLO (Association
for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography) Con-
ference that will be held in San Juan (Puerto Rico) in
February 2019.
The proposed session aims to attract cutting-edge re-
search from investigators working on environmental
epigenetics across dierent levels (from molecules to
ecosystems), and using diverse model systems (espe-
cially ecologically and environmentally relevant species
in aquatic environments). The ultimate goal is to pro-
vide a timely insight into the potential of this approach
to revolutionize our understanding of ecological and evo-
lutionary dynamics at a critical climate change juncture,
in an invaluable marine setting.
Additional details about the session can be found here:
https://aslo.org/sanjuan2019/sessions In addition, gen-
eral info and deadlines about the Conference can be
found here:
https://aslo.org/sanjuan2019/main Please come and
join us in San Juan for exciting discussions and to dis-
cover (or re-discover) the immense beauty of Puerto
Rico.
Please help us spread the word by forwarding this mes-
sage to other colleagues who may be interested in joining
the session and/or attending this conference.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate in con-tacting us.

Comparative analyses across multiple species are a cru-
cial tool for understanding biodiversity loss and re-
silience in the face of global change as well as evolution
and adaptation. This kind of analysis requires curated
data from many species as well as a phylogeny link-
ing those species. Unfortunately, eorts at compiling
such data for insect and other arthropod species lag
behind similar eorts for vertebrates and plants. While
many independent resources exist (such as databases
and recording schemes) that catalogue various arthropod
traits, e.g. ecological habitats, distribution and occur-
rence, there remains a need for eorts to coordinate
these various resources in a centralised, user-friendly
way, via e.g. shared protocols, structures and ID tags,
and for researchers to integrate these data easily into
their workows.
The proposed Special Interest Group would bring
together curators of independent resources with re-
searchers and professionals interested in using compara-
tive arthropod data - to present resources, and discuss
and establish common data requirements and protocols.
The project is intended to be ongoing as new resources
emerge and are linked to the project, and greater inte-
gration is achieved. In the short term, one anticipated
outcome is that participants are all simply more aware
of, and familiar with, the existence, availability and pro-
tocols of various insect data resources. This in itself may
likely lead to several new data-related collaborations.
In the medium term, the resources themselves might be
adapted to reect agreed shared protocols, encouraging
transparency and standardisation, and harmonizing the
process of data retrieval from multiple resources. In the
longer term, a steering group formed from members of
the SIG might aim to create a central meta-platform
linking through to the various resources to make inte-
grated analysis much easier and to make these data
more widely available to researchers from a wide array
of disciplines.

Short summary The most immediate response of animals
to human-induced environmental change is behavioural.
This can have profound repercussions at the population
and community level and is therefore of crucial relevance
to conservation. This NERC/ZSL symposium will bring
together leading experts in behavioural ecology and
conservation to explore how behavioural ecologists can
make a dierence in support of conservation by relating
their research to ecosystem processes. This meeting
will critically assess the role of the behavioural ecologi-
cal community in addressing conservation priorities so
far and aims to inspire future conservation-oriented re-
search and action with real impact. Now is a highly
promising time for progress in this direction because of
the emergence of strong analytical tools and conceptual
advances in behavioural ecology in recent years, devel-
opments which have yet to nd their way fully into the
conservation arena.

FishLifeHistory
We seek a graduate student for a newly NSF-funded
project examining the life history decisions made by
male smallmouth bass. The student will begin in Spring
2019 (ideally), will be based at Bowling Green State
University (working with Daniel Wiegmann), and will
collaborate with faculty at Rice University (Scott Egan
and Kelly Weinersmith) and Colorado State (Lisa An-
geloni). We oer full funding for a Master's student, or
partial funding for a PhD student (whose funding would
subsequently be covered by teaching assistantships).
This project would be a good t for a student interested
in a career in natural resource management, evolution-
ary biology, and/or advanced quantitative methods.Please send an email containing your CV to Drs. Daniel
Wiegmann at ddwiegm@bgsu.edu and Kelly Weiner-
smith at Weinersmith@Rice.edu if you're interested.
Thanks!
Here is an abstract for the project:
The realization that many, perhaps most, alternative
reproductive tactics, or ARTs, depend on individual
condition sparked a general interest in the proximate
control of tactic expression and the ultimate control of
tactic frequencies within populations. How ARTs coex-
ist within a population is an evolutionary puzzle that is
only partially resolved. ARTs are evolutionary solutions
to reproductive competition, products of an investment
strategy that accounts for individual condition and t
into a broader category of investment strategies, which
includes life history decisions. ARTs reect allocation
responses to conditions under which individuals have
developed. Project researchers will detail ARTs in a pop-
ulation of smallmouth bass (*Micropterous dolomieu*)
from data collected in a ten-year, multigenerationalOctober 1, 2018 EvolDir 13
study that includes detailed information on individual
reproductive behavior. The system has special intrigue
because a non-genetic parental eect is hypothesized to
cause tactic alternation within lineages, across genera-
tions, which may facilitate or impede adaptive evolu-
tionary processes. To test the genetic basis of this tactic
polymorphism, RADSeq from preserved tissue samples
will be used to generate thousands of SNPs across the
genome and paternity analysis will be applied to trace
tactic choices by males in 240-381 lineages, across 1-5
generations to detail parent and ospring tactic choices.
Developmental conditions and growth histories will be
determined from eld data and scale samples to identify
factors that control the expression of tactics. Under-
graduates from underrepresented groups in STEM and
graduate students will be trained in genetics, genomics,
bio-informatics and sheries techniques. Results will
be disseminated through press releases, podcasts, blog
posts and an animated video made publicly available
and distributed to resource managers and others to
display where shing licenses are sold.

HybridisationBarriers
MSc project: Endosperm-based hybridisation barriers
in wild Arabidopsis Department of Botany, Faculty of
Science, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic
Polyploidy (whole genome duplication) has played a ma-
jor role in plant evolution. Most angiosperms are poly-
ploid, and the model plant species, Arabidopsis arenosa
has naturally occurring diploid and autotetraploid cy-
totypes. Diploid and tetraploid populations meet at
several stable contact zones across Europe, where mixed
ploidy populations occur. Despite the two cytotypes be-
ing close enough to exchange genes, triploid individuals
are rare.
Endosperm-based hybridisation barriers are known to
play an important role in the patterns of gene ow
between dierent species of Arabidopsis, but we are in-
terested in exploring the role of endosperm development
in interploidy crosses within a species, and the post-
zygotic mechanisms resulting in the apparent selection
against triploids.
The successful candidate will be supervised by Dr Emma
Morgan, as part of Dr Filip Kol a's multidisciplinaryteam of Plant Ecological Genomics at Charles University
in Prague (https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen/).
The main techniques used will be: (1) crossing experi-
ments between plants of dierent ploidies and lineages
(2) visualising endosperm cellularisation using confo-
cal microscopy (3) screening of ploidy levels using ow
cytometry
We oer: (1) additional experience with collaboration
with other researchers and students (2) work in the his-
torical centre of the UNESCO heritage site of Prague
city (3) a possible contribution towards living costs in
Prague (funding to be veried)
We require: (1) BSc degree in Biology/Ecology or a
related eld (2) motivation for interdisciplinary research
at the border of ecology, botany and experimental plant
biology
Desirable: (1) experience with design and data analysis
of ecological experiments
Interested students should contact Dr Emma Morgan
with a CV, short motivation letter and contacts of two
referees. Applications will be gladly accepted asap, but
start date is negotiable.

I am seeking a PhD student to carry out research asso-
ciated with an NSF-supported project focused on the
genetic underpinnings of mimicry and color pattern evo-
lution in a mimetic radiation of poison frogs in Peru
(see description below), starting in Spring or Fall 2019.
Candidates must have a strong academic record and be
motivated to continue learning. Desirable qualications
for the position include an interest in the evolutionary
biology and genetics of tropical amphibians, and some
combination of 1) background in evolutionary genetics
or genomics, 2) experience working in a molecular genet-
ics laboratory, 3) previous work with amphibians and
captive breeding, 4) eldwork on amphibians (especially
in Latin America), 5) programming experience in R,
Python and/or UNIX.
Direct support through research assistantships is avail-able for 2 years, followed by support through teaching
assistantships (at least 5 years of support in total). The
Department of Biology at ECU is large and multidisci-
plinary, with strong research groups in evolution, ecol-
ogy, behavior and genomics: see www.ecu.edu/biology
for more information on the department. East Carolina
University is located in Greenville, North Carolina, cen-
trally located between Raleigh and the Outer Banks.
The Summers lab focuses on evolution, ecology and
behavior of the Neotropical poison frogs. See my lab
research page at http://blog.ecu.edu/sites/summersk/-
research-page/ for more information. I encourage appli-
cations from minorities and under-represented groups
of all kinds. Please send a letter detailing your research
interests and experience, as well as a current CV (includ-
ing coursework), GRE scores (if available), and names
and addresses of three references, to Kyle Summers
(summersk@ecu.edu).
This project combines three research groups with com-
plementary skills and realms of expertise to investi-
gate the genetic basis and population genomic processes
underlying color pattern divergence in the context of
mimicry in the Peruvian mimic poison frog, Ranitomeya
imitator: Dr. Kyle Summers (East Carolina University),
Dr. Rasmus Nielsen (UC Berkeley) and Dr. Matthew
MacManes (University of New Hampshire). The project
will make use of several dierent approaches: 1. Next
generation sequencing (RNAseq, Illumina platform) will
be used to produce transcriptomes across species, color
pattern morphs, and color patches within morphs. These
will be assembled and used to investigate patterns of
dierential gene expression. 2. Genome-wide marker
arrays (exome capture sequences) will be used to screen
transition zone samples and enable divergence and ad-
mixture mapping to identify candidate genes. 3. We will
test the association of specic candidate loci with color
pattern variation using pedigree analyses of candidate
genes identied from 1 and 2, using a multigenerational
pedigree. 4. We will investigate the expression patterns
of these genes in developing embryos using designed
hybridization probes. 5. We will use phylogenomic
methods to reconstruct the evolution of the divergent
populations of R. imitator, and of the color genes in
those populations. 6. We will test specic hypothe-
ses regarding selection and demographic processes in
the transition zones and between mimics and models.
Together these complementary, mutually reinforcing ap-
proaches will begin to reveal the genetic underpinnings
and population genomics of color pattern diversity in
this mimetic radiation of poison frogs.

ETHZurich EvolutionaryTheory
Position for Ph.D. student in multiscale mechanisms of
evolution Application review begins November 15, 2018
The Theoretical Biology Group (www.tb.ethz.ch) at
ETH Zurich is hiring a Ph.D. student to study multi-
scale mechanisms of evolutionary dynamics in microbes.
Description of the position
Evolution is a process that fundamentally spans multiple
length and time scales, from the nanoscale of individual
DNA base pairs to the macroscale of entire populations.
Quantitative predictions of evolutionary dynamics must
therefore address the interplay of processes at all of
these scales. We are hiring a student to develop mul-
tiscale models of evolution by combining biophysical
and systems-level modeling of cellular processes with
models of population dynamics, focusing on microbes
such as E. coli. The project will involve a combination
of mathematical modeling (borrowed especially from
statistical physics), simulations, and data analysis, in-
cluding the opportunity to work in close collaboration
with experimentalists as well as other theorists.
The position will be supervised by Dr. Michael
Manhart (www.people.fas.harvard.edu/ ~mman-
hart) in the group of Prof. Sebastian Bonhoeer
(www.tb.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid316),
with close interactions with the Molecular Microbial
Ecology Group (http://www.mme.ethz.ch) led by Prof.
Martin Ackermann (www.mme.ethz.ch/people/person-
detail.MTIxMzg2.TGlzdC8xNjQ2LC00OTcyMDA2NDk=.html).
The successful applicant will join the world-class re-
search community at ETH and greater Zurich studying
quantitative and systems biology. The position oers
a highly competitive starting salary of 47,040 CHF as
well as excellent benets.
Qualications
Applicants should have a master's degree in physics, the-
oretical or computational biology, theoretical chemistry,
applied mathematics, or a related eld. Some coding
experience (e.g., Python or C/C++) is also valuable. A
formal background in biology is not necessary, although
applicants should demonstrate a strong interest.
Application instructions
Please e-mail the following to Dr. Michael Manhart at
theor.biol.phd.position@gmail.com:1. A cover letter describing your interest in the position,
qualications (including previous research experience),
and how it will contribute to your long-term career goals
2. Your CV 3. Names and contact information for three
references
We will begin reviewing applications on November 15,
2018 and continue until the position is lled. We value di-
versity and strongly encourage applications from women,
persons with disabilities, and members of other groups
underrepresented in science.

LinnaeusU.CooperativeBreeding.MoleRats
Description We are seeking a highly motivated PhD stu-
dent to be part of a newly established research group to
investigate the causes and consequences of cooperative
breeding in Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damaren-
sis). The student will be involved in an ongoing eld
study in South Africa investigating the evolutionary
causes and consequences of cooperative breeding and
will use an established laboratory population to address
questions about the physiological control of social be-
haviour in mole-rats.
Damaraland mole-rats are cooperative breeders that live
in groups of up to 30 individuals. Breeding is limited to
one reproductive female per group and non-reproductive
males and females delay dispersal from the group and
contribute to cooperative tasks (cooperative foraging,
colony defense and allo-parental care). Individuals vary
in investment in cooperative tasks but it is unclear how
non-breeders aect the development of ospring and
reproductive success in the groups. It is also largely
unknown which physiological mechanisms underlie vari-
ation in cooperative behaviour.At our eld site, the Kalahari Research Centre (KRC,
http://kalahari-meerkats.com/kmp/krc/), we are con-
ducting research on a wild population of individually
marked Damaraland mole-rats since 2014. The PhD
student will be involved in maintaining this study popu-
lation and will conduct eld experiments manipulating
breeding status and group size to investigate the costs
and benets of groups living and cooperative breeding
to non-breeders and breeders. Additionally, the student
will conduct hormonal manipulations of non-breeders
and breeders to investigate the physiological control
of parental and allo-parental care behavior in captive
mole-rat groups maintained at the KRC.
The position is fully funded for 4 years and the success-
ful applicant will be part of EEMiS, a multidisciplinary
center of excellence within Linnaeus University, Kalmar,
Sweden (www.lnu.se). The PhD student will be part of
a large collaborative project that involves several inter-
national collaborators. The specic research questions
can be adjusted to the interests and qualications of
the successful candidate.
According to the Higher Education Ordinance a person
appointed to a doctoral studentship should primarily
devote himself/herself to his/her own studies. An ap-
pointee may, however, work to a limited extent with
education, research, artistic development, and admin-
istration. However, before a doctoral degree has been
awarded, duties of this kind may not comprise more
than 20% of a full-time post.
https://lnu.se/en/education/PhD-studies/ Require-
ments A person fulls the general entry requirements
if he/she has been awarded a degree on second-cycle
level (MSc), or completed the requirements for courses
comprising at least 240 credits, of which 60 credits on
second-cycle level, or in any other way, in Sweden or
abroad, has acquired principally equivalent knowledge.
Specic requirements refer to A master in biology (or
equivalent), ideally with specialization in animal ecology,
evolutionary or behavioral ecology and physiology.
Excellent analytic skills and an interest in analyzing life
history data, individual growth and tness data, as well
as an interest for experimental work in wild populations
are essential.
The successful candidate needs to be enthusiastic and
happy to spend 4-6 months per year in Africa at our
research site.
Assessment grounds It is desirable that the applicant has
experience with eldwork in remote locations and has
worked on wild animal populations and/or has a back-
ground in animal physiology. Experience with working
on small mammals is considered an asset.October 1, 2018 EvolDir 19
The application (in English) should contain a CV (with

*What we expect*
The successful applicant will hold an MSc-degree or
equivalent (a degree with a standard period of study of
at least 8 semesters) in Biology, Forestry, Geography or
a related relevant discipline. The working language in
the project is English. The ability to communicate and
collaborate in an international team is required, as is
the ability to work independently under physically and
mentally demanding eld conditions. As this dendroge-
netic study lies at the crossroad of dendroecology and
association genomics, a broad interest in these topics
and the willingness for extensive literature surveys is
required. We expect good knowledge in data handling
and statistics. Prior experience in any of the elds of
population genetics, dendroecology, bioinformatics, as
well as in eld work is benecial. The capability to

a project funded under the 'Toppforsk Program', jointly
nanced by the Research Council of Norway and the
Natural History Museum: 'SpeciationClock: How fast
does the 'speciation clock' tick in selng versus outcross-
ing lineages?' The project addresses how and how long
it takes for new, reproductively isolated plant species to
arise and what factors inuence the rate of speciation.
More about the project and positions The project is
organized in four work packages (WPs) which will 1)
establish a theoretical framework to understand and
predict the eects of mating system on the speciation
process, 2) measure the rate of accumulation of intraspe-
cic postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI) in a large
set of species representing the selng-outcrossing spec-
trum and divergence times spanning the last ~1 million
years, 3) test if the rate at which RI loci accumulate is
higher in selfers, and 4) quantify the role that selection
has played on RI loci using population genomic analyses
in one selng and one outcrossing species. We have
selected the tropical African 'sky archipelago' as a study
system because the populations in these isolated high
mountains represent a wide range of divergence times
and levels of intermountain gene ow. Field experi-October 1, 2018 EvolDir 21
ments and collection of material for the SpeciationClock
project will be conducted during two long eld seasons,
starting in the Ethiopian mountains in October 2018.
The project also includes extensive cultivation and cross-
ing experiments, genomic analyses, and niche modeling
through time.
One of the postdoctoral fellowships (Postdoc no. 1) an-
nounced here is a two-year fellowship connected to WP1.
The selected candidate for this position will be based at
the NHM in Oslo, but will spend considerable parts of
the time in France working with the WP1 Leader, Dr.
Sylvain Gl emin at the ECOBIO lab at the University
of Rennes.
The other postdoctoral fellowship (Postdoc no. 2) is a
three-year fellowship primarily connected to WP2, but
will also contribute to WP3 and WP4.
The PhD fellowship is a four-year fellowship, of which
75% of the time will be devoted to the PhD programme,
mainly connected to WP3 and WP4, and 25% of the
time will be devoted to duty work for the museum
(teaching, public outreach, collection work).
Principal investigator (PI): Christian Brochmann, Nat-
ural History Museum. Co-PI: Anne K. Brysting, Centre

development with favorable seasons, these responses
evolved independently. The successful applicant will
compare the regulation of seasonal responses in the
West Nile Virus vector, Culex pipiens, and the Brown
Marmorated stink bug. The successful applicant will
also hone a variety of molecular techniques (e.g. analyz-
ing bioinformatics datasets, transforming embryos using
CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis) and will have opportunities
to apply their ndings in evolutionary, ecological and
applied contexts. Students will receive close mentorship
as they prepare scientic manuscripts, develop original
grant proposals, and present their research at scientic
meetings, ultimately preparing them for competitive
positions in industry, academia or government.

Paris EvolutionSexualReproduction
A PhD position is open in the Teot onio lab at the
Institut de Biologie de l' ~Acole Normale Sup erieure
(IBENS), in Paris, France (http://www.ibens.ens.fr/-
spip.php?article351); as part of a collaborative research
project between the host lab and that of Denis Roze at
the CNRS Marine Station in Rosco, France (http://-
www.sb-rosco.fr/en/roze-denis/58).
The Teot onio lab uses Caenorhabditis elegans exper-
imental evolution to study natural selection in the
evolution of distributions in life-history, behaviour,
metabolism and gene expression traits. We further
investigate the population genomics of adaptation to
novel environments.
The project will study the evolution of recombination
under partial selng with the main objectives being: (1)
to determine natural selection on recombination modi-
ers using experimental evolution in C. elegans; (2) to
describe the genetic variance components (dominance,
epistasis) of tness traits, explaining the evolution of
recombination; and (3) to integrate theoretical models
developed in the Roze lab with the experimental data.
Candidates are expected to have a master's degree in
evolutionary biology and an excellent understanding
of the fundamental problems of quantitative genetics
and population genetics, including QTL and GWAS
mapping. Candidates with experience in model organ-
ism handling, computer programming, experimental
evolution and statistical analysis of large data sets are
preferred. The project may involve the use of genetic
transformation methods, so experience with molecular
and developmental biology techniques is a plus. The
PhD student will be expected to conduct full-time and
independent research in the Teot onio lab, in close col-
laboration with other team members and with Denis
Roze in Rosco.
The PhD position is funded by the National Agency
of French Research (ANR) for three years, subject to
an initial evaluation after 6 months, with a potential
one-year extension. Successful applicants can start their
PhD as soon as November 2018.

ment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the Uni-
versity of Connecticut seeks motivated PhD students
to join the lab in the Summer/Fall 2019. Our research
focuses on the computational analysis of genomic and
transcriptomic data generated by next-generation se-
quencing platforms from non-model forest tree species.
We implement this through analysis related to gene
nding, gene expression, transcriptome assembly, and
conserved element identication, through machine learn-
ing and computational statistics. We use these methods
to address questions related to genome biology and pop-
ulation genomics. In addition, we develop web-based
applications that integrate BIG data across domains
to facilitate the forest geneticist or ecologist's ability
to analyze, share, and visualize their data (http://-
treegenesdb.org). Such integration requires the imple-
mentation of semantic technologies and ontologies to
connect genotype, phenotype, and environmental re-
sources. We collaborate and contribute to the TRIPAL
project (http://tripal.info).
RESEARCH TOPICS:
Potential research topics in our group include 1) devel-
opment of visualization tools and integration of high
throughout environmental data to support genome-wide
association studies in forest trees; 2) application of ge-
nomic and transcriptomic techniques to evaluate the
impact of climate change on tree populations; 3) devel-
opment of software solutions to improve assembly and
characterization of non-model plant genomes (and tran-
scriptomes); 4) interrogation of natural genetic variation
across populations in large, complex conifer genomes; 5)
and your ideas here!

UWolverhampton PopGenToads
The Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE) at the
University of Wolverhampton is looking for a motivated
and resourceful PhD student with an interest in am-
phibians, eldwork and genetics to take up a partially
funded 3-year PhD research project entitled 'Back to
the future? Unravelling historic, current and potential
future declines of the common toad, Bufo bufo, in the
UK.'
Common toads, Bufo bufo, are declining across many
parts of the UK, especially within England. The rea-
sons and extent of these declines are not fully known,
however they are likely a combination of habitat loss
and fragmentation, other human impacts and disease.
Many amphibians can survive with small population
sizes, suggesting that neutral or adaptive evolution may
enable populations to survive drastic declines.
It is uncertain what the impacts of current population38 EvolDir October 1, 2018
declines are on B. bufo across the UK and whether the
species has been resilient to similar processes historically.
The PhD student will compare genetic, morphological,
population and environmental data to investigate ge-
ographic structuring, genetic diversity through time
and the impacts of environmental change on toad pop-
ulations. Using data generated for past and present
toad populations, the student will build models for fu-
ture population trends and provide important informa-
tion about management strategies. The project will
involve: eldwork, molecular lab work (including ex-
tracting DNA from formalin xed museum specimens
and High-Throughput Sequencing) and morphological
museum work.
The project will be based at the University of Wolver-
hampton (UoW) and will take place in collaboration
with the University of Salford (UoS) and Amphibian
and Reptile Conservation Trust (ARC); there will also
be some involvement with the Institute of Zoology and
British museums. The supervisory team consists of Dr
Simon Maddock (UoW), Dr Robert Jehle (UoS) and Dr
John Wilkinson (ARC). For informal enquiries please
contact Dr Maddock - s.maddock@wlv.ac.uk.
The project will be based within the Rosalind Franklin
Building, which is the University of Wolverhampton's
new 22 million science building and houses a broad range
of state-of-the-art research facilities.
Eligibility and How to ApplyThe student should have at
least a 2:1 BSc with Honours and/or Merit at MSc level
or equivalent in a relevant subject. The student should
hold a valid driving licence. The ideal candidate should
have some lab work and amphibian eldwork experi-
ence. The student should be able to work independently
and be able to manage small groups of volunteers and
undergraduate students. If your BSc/MSc award was
not delivered in English you will need to demonstrate
prociency in English at IELTS 6.5 or equivalent.
Deadline for applications: 19th October 2018 Interview
date: 12th November 2018 Start Date: January 2019

students will develop and conduct independent research
using cutting-edge phylogenetic and macroevolutionary
methods in a variety of empirical systems, ranging from
plants to animals. The primary research goal of the
lab is to understand how to connect macroevolutionary
patterns to our understanding of biological processes
at other scales (e.g. eld studies, paleontology, quan-
titative genetics, biomechanics, etc.). Prior experience
with macroevolutionary modeling and computational
biology is not required and students will be encouraged
to ask broad evolutionary questions in empirical sys-
tems. Along the way, students will gain experience with
statistical modeling and computational techniques for
studying evolutionary patterns using phylogenetic trees.
Examples of ongoing projects in the lab include stud-
ies of the drivers of shifts in metabolic scaling across
the tree of life, using anatomical relationships to model
whole organism phenotypic evolution in vertebrates,
and connecting biomechanical performance landscapes
to macroevolutionary studies of adaptive radiations.
Students with interests in either empirical/eld based
projects or computational projects are encouraged to ap-
ply. The lab strongly values diversity and inclusiveness,
and strives to support students from all backgrounds to
achieve their academic, career and life goals. Applicants
interested in applying for an NSF GRFP should email as

EvolutionCommunication
2 PhD positions on the evolution of communication in
urban environments
Job / Project Description The Department of Ecological
Science, section Animal Ecology of VU University Ams-
terdam has two PhD-positions available for the project:
CITISENSE: 'Evolving communication systems in re-
sponse to urban sensory conditions '
Animals have evolved an astounding variety of signals to
attract mates, fend-o rivals or avoid predators. These
animal communication systems play a crucial role in
evolutionary processes such as adaptation and specia-
tion. Understanding how these communication systems
evolve is therefore very important, in particular in our
rapidly changing world.
In the project CITISENSE, funded through an ERC
starting grant to Wouter Halfwerk, the evolution of com-
munication systems will be studied in urban and forest
populations of the tungara frog in central Panama. The
main aim is to understand how males of this species
have adapted their calling behaviour to changes in noise
and light levels that are associated with increased ur-
banization. Key questions that need to be addressed
are:
1) How do male tungara frogs adjust their signals to
altered sensory environments? We will assess plasticity40 EvolDir October 1, 2018
and heritability of signal divergence found between ur-
ban and forest populations. 2) How do male frog signals
evolve in response to direct (via sender) and indirect
(via receivers) selection pressures? We will expose forest
sites to noise and light pollution and carry out experi-
mental evolution using articial phenotypes. 3) What
are the evolutionary consequences of signal divergence?
We will assess inter-and-intra sexual responses to signal
divergence between urban and forest populations.
We are searching for two PhD-students who will address
these questions as a team and who will i) carry out
a large-scale eld experiment in tropical rainforest in
Panama; ii) carry out lab experiments on male sexual
signaling and female preferences; iii) Assess correlations
between behavioural, physiological and morphological
traits associated with signaling; iv) Quantify heritability
of signal components through breeding experiments and
pedigree analyses.

CuratorTerrestrialMammalogy
Curator, Terrestrial Mammals The Natural History Mu-
seum of Los Angeles County (NHMLA) seeks a Curator
of Terrestrial Mammals to lead its research on urban
mammals, to oversee the growth and care of collections,
and to provide content for a variety of public programs.
The successful candidate will conduct collection-based
research in evolutionary biology and/or ecology broadlyOctober 1, 2018 EvolDir 53
dened and will be a leader in the care, understanding,
and use of museum collections.
This position has a special emphasis on urban stud-
ies as this complements existing research and outreach
strengths, and builds upon existing relationships with
local organizations and community members developed
by NHMLA's Urban Nature Research Center (UNRC).
The UNRC engages in research that examines the ef-
fects of urbanization on wildlife using community science
(=citizen science) approaches for surveying urban biodi-
versity. Qualied candidates may have research interests
across the globe, but interest in advancing programs
in Southern California through community science ap-
proaches is paramount.
NHMLA's mammalogy collection includes more than
98,000 specimens representing terrestrial and marine
taxa. The specimens are prepared as study skins, skulls,
skeletons and pelts, as well as ancillary collections of
frozen tissues, bacula, and parasites, spanning all orders
and most families within Mammalia. This collection is
suitable for a broad range of evolutionary and ecological
studies, including the eects of urbanization. The col-
lection of terrestrial mammals has strong emphasis on
North American (particularly Californian), Neotropical,
and African mammals, with additional strengths in Old
World fruit bats. The collection is complemented by the
world-renowned Late Pleistocene-Holocene collection of
the La Brea Tar Pits (a site administered by NHMLA),
providing historical context for the diversity and ecology
of terrestrial mammals in Southern California.
The successful candidate will have a record of out-
standing research, excellent communication skills, and
a demonstrated ability to engage the public and stake-
holders; experience with the care, management, and
operation of natural history collections is highly desir-
able. A Ph.D. and a strong track record of peer-reviewed
publications focusing on evolutionary biology and/or
ecology are required. The Curator will be expected to
build an active and publicly appealing research program,
to oversee the management and continued development
of the terrestrial mammal collection, to lead all pro-
grams on urban mammals, and to supervise sta and
volunteers of the Mammalogy Department. Addition-
ally, the successful candidate is expected to develop
working relationships with local universities, mentor stu-
dents and postdoctoral fellows, strengthen NHMLA's
presence in key professional and governmental networks,
and maintain and sustain research through competitive
grants and/or other funding from external sources. The
Curator will be expected to participate actively in a
broad range of museum activities, including exhibits,
education, community science programs, educator and

approaches. *

*Practical information * Lab location: the laboratory
is situated on a small campus between Bordeaux (20
km) & Arcachon (40 km). Being dedicated to wood
and forest management, it oers a nice working environ-
ment within a beautiful forest domain and gives promi-

*Project summary * The large amount of genomic data
available nowadays allows us to infer the demographic
history of species. It is especially interesting to use
these data and methods to infer the history of species
dierentiation, that is to understand the process of spe-
ciation. Methods of demographic inferences generally
consider 2 populations/species at a time. Although
straightforward, this can lead to spurious results where
one considers complexes where several species present
incomplete reproductive isolation to each others (aka
species complexes). Methods do exist to analyse multi-
ple species simultaneously, however they require to know
the phylogeny of incipient species a priori. This pre-
requisite is really complicated to full for some species
complexes as high levels of gene ow can strongly blur
the real phylogeny of incipient species. Therefore, there
is no satisfying method currently in existence to infer
simultaneously the order of incipient species separations
(aka the phylogeny) and the speciation parameters (rate
of gene ow between incipient species, divergence time,
eective population sizes) for species complexes with
high gene ow. Using an approximate Bayesian com-
putation framework including machine learning, this
project aims to determine the best way to infer the spe-
ciation history of species complexes with high gene ow
by comparing pairwise and multi-species approaches of
demographic inferences.
*Description * Background: The large amount of ge-
nomic data available nowadays allows us to infer the
demographic history of species (e.g. estimations of pop-
ulation size, gene ow rates and divergent time between
species). This allows us to assess the impact of histori-October 1, 2018 EvolDir 77
cal events on population evolution, a famous example
being the impact of ice age cycles on patterns of ge-
netic diversity of species. Inferring the demography of
incipient species is also required to understand how they
diverge, that is the speciation process. Speciation comes
along with reproductive isolation (RI) and RI is driven
by the accumulation of reproductive barriers during a
period called the \grey zone of speciation" (Roux et
al. 2016). During this period, incipient species are
not totally reproductively isolated yet. Demographic
inferences are ideal to study this period since speciation
research has shown the key role of (i) divergence times
and (ii) inter-species migration (aka gene ow), further
to adaptation, in barrier accumulation (Abbot et al.
2013). For instance, this approach is able to test for
gene ow during divergence while also characterising the
evolution of eective population sizes and estimating
divergence times (Roux et al. 2016).
Demographic inference methods usually consider 2 popu-
lations/species at a time, i.e. pairwise methods (Nielsen
& Wakeley 2001). Although straightforward and robust
(Beaumont 2008; Strasburg & Rieseberg 2010), this can
lead to spurious results where one considers complexes
where several incipient species present incomplete repro-
ductive isolation to each other (aka species complexes).
Methods do exist to analyse multiple species simultane-
ously, however they require to know the phylogeny of
incipient species a priori (e.g. Hey 2010). This prereq-
uisite may be very hard or even impossible to reach for
some species complexes with

The genomics revolution of recent decades has given
us tools to study the genetic inuences on almost any
kind of trait. The ease with which we can collectge-
nomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data opens up
new avenues of research questions that were impractical
or even unimaginable only a few years ago. Forexample,
we can test hypotheses about the -omic basis of a range
of behaviors of interest to evolutionary biologists and
behavioral ecologists - in particular,the molecular basis
of naturally occurring social behaviors. Furthermore,
we are not limited to a few model organisms; we can
collect genomic andtranscriptomic data on non-model
organisms. We can even collect large genomic datasets
on non-model organisms in the eld. The aim of this
Special Column is to address genomic, transcriptomic,
and proteomic research on naturally occurring social
behaviors in animals, both modeland non-model organ-
isms, including: parent-ospring behaviors, cooperation,
aggressive and agonistic behaviors, mating displays, and
mate preference. Weare also interested in studies that
explore the possibilities and pitfalls of conducting ge-
nomic studies in the eld and on non-model animals.
We hope to include road body of research on dierent
species and approaches in addressing this topic, but we
are especially interested in naturally occurring behaviors
andnatural systems.
Researchers interested in contributing to this specialcolumn should send a title and abstract to the guest ed-
itors. Manuscripts should be submitted before thedead-
line. Manuscripts received after the deadline will be
considered as submissions for regular issues.
Submitted papers should not have been published pre-
viously, nor be under consideration for publication else-
where. Submitted manuscripts are accepted withthe
understanding that they are subject to peer review and
editorial revision. Publication is free of page charges.
All articles are available for readers to nd andread for
free online complying with the Open Access policies of
many research funding bodies.

biology- themed movies. therefore we are looking for
contributions from biologists worldwide that would make
our lm better and more compelling. What we look for
are footages that show the beauty/structure/complexity
of biology, e.g. things like: - ocks/herds of animals -footages of animals/plants/fungi from under a micro-
scope - time-lapse movies of plant/animal behaviour.
Any other topics that t the theme of \energy" (energy
ow through living systems - topic of the 1st episode) or
\structures" (complexity and order in living structures -
topic of the 2nd episode) are welcome.
Since it is a non-prot project we cannot oer any nan-
cial gratication - however we will provide full credits
in the nal production as to where and by whom the
movies were lmed.
If you think you may have such videos and would like
to share them with us - please contact Szymek Drob-
niak (szymek.drobniak atuj.edu.pl) with information of
what you would like to share. Since the footages lmed
by us in studio are shot in FullHD - this is the quality
that we need in order to make the whole production
look uniform.

Paris AppleDomestication
Internship
Title: Reconstructing apple tree domestication: on
the contribution of Caucasian and Central Asian wild
species.
Summary
The role of gene ow during adaptation still remains
little understood. Domestication is a relevant model
for investigating such question because of the weak re-
productive barriers that imply recurrent crop-wild gene
ow. Our recent results showed an initial domestica-
tion of the cultivated apple from the Central Asian wild
apple (Malus sieversii) followed by a substantial contri-
bution of the European wild apple (M. sylvestris) to
the cultivated apple genome (Cornille et al. 2012 Plos
Genetics) by recent wild-to-crop introgressions. Yet, the
contribution of other wild apple species (Caucasian and
Central Asian) present along the Silk Roads has been
suggested (Cornille et al. 2014 Trends in Genetics). The
student will use a unique collection of 3,000 wild and
cultivated apple samples genotyped for 26 microsatellite
markers to quantify the contribution of additional wild
species present along the Silk Routes and the extent of
wild-to-crop gene ow in the apple system. This unique80 EvolDir October 1, 2018
collection of samples including additional wild species
and local cultivars along the Silk Routes compared to
our previous work (Cornille et al. 2012 PloS Genetics),
that will make it possible to reconstruct the full domes-
tication history of the apple and will bring new insights
into domestication of perennials (Cornille et al. 2014
Trends in Genetics).
The Master 2 student will have the opportunity to pur-
sue a PhD project starting in fall 2019 on the adaptive
genomics of apple domestication, using whole genomes.
This ambitious project will yield unprecedented insights
into the genomic process of adaptation, introducing to
the international research community the apple tree as
a unique model, with a recent history of gene ow and
selection triggered by humans, with fundamental and
applied consequences of the ndings.
Duration : 6 months, january/feb 2019 - june/july
2019 , starting dates are exible, contact Amandine
CORNILLE for further discussions. Monthly gratica-
tion: 500 euros/months.
Methodology: population genetic analyses (genetic di-
versity, population structure and demographic inferences
using Approximate Bayesian Computation).
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-
date will have skills in genetics/genomics and evolution
and at least will show strong interest in these elds.
He/she will not necessarily be familiar with apple mod-
els. The Master project will be proposed to the Doc-
toral School \Science du V eg etal" (Paris-Sud Doctoral
School) for a PhD project on the genomic basis of apple
adaptation during domestication in june 2019.

Survey on Instructor Views on Mathematics taught in
Biology
Quantitative skills are becoming increasingly important
to both medical science and biological research. As
biology researchers and educators, we need to develop
an understanding of how to develop mathematical skills
in undergraduates to prepare them for the future. It
has been shown that the ability to make connections
between mathematical expressions and scientic phe-
nomena (sensemaking) increases quantitative problem-
solving and conceptual understanding. However, it is
not yet known what factors underlie the development
of sensemaking or what types of instruction facilitates
sensemaking.
If you are an instructor of an undergraduate biology
course at a University/College in the United States of
America, we are asking for your help in developing this
understanding.
The lowest level of participation is to share your ex-
perience and attitudes on mathematics in biology by
completing this survey (approximately 10 minutes).
https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/-
SV9Esb4P20Ipi9uLz This survey will be closed82 EvolDir October 1, 2018
on Monday, October 1 at 11:59 pm CST.
In addition to the survey, there are three additional
ways to participate.
1. Distribute the BIMODALS survey to students of a
biology course in which you are teaching mathematical
expressions.
2. Send us an audio recording of you teaching a lesson or
series of lessons on a mathematical expression in biology.
3. Participate in a 30 minute interview about your atti-
tudes about mathematical expressions and teaching of
those expressions.
At the end of the survey, we will ask if you would be
willing to participate in these additional ways. If you
are, we will collect your e-mail address so that we can
contact you.
If you have any questions concerning the research,
please contact Linh Chau (lchau@umn.edu) or Anita
Schuchardt (aschucha@umn.edu).
Thank you for supporting this research and please share
this e-mail with your colleagues!

LifeHistoryEvolutionBees
I am seeking a eld assistant to help with PhD research
on the neotropical facultatively social sweat bee *Mega-
lopta genalis *at the Smithsonian Tropical Research
Institute (STRI) on Barro Colorado Island from Feb-
Jun 2019 (four months).
This project will be looking at the relationships between
life history traits important to the evolution of sociality
while focusing on the facultatively social sweat bee *M.
genalis*. Work will be conducted on the Barro Col-
orado Island (BCI), a research station situated in the
Panama Canal, Panama operated by the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute. The combination of tropical
eldwork and an internationally-known research station
makes this an excellent opportunity to get experience
and exposure to research.
Main eld duties include nding nests of *Megalopta
genalis* and husbandry of bees. This requires hiking
through the tropical forest on BCI both on and o trail
system. Duties will also include setting up new adults in
articial nests for the purposes of tracking colony devel-
opment. It's also expected that the intern will develop
an independent research project curtailed to their own
interests over the course of the 4 months, ideally having
to do with the study organism. The candidate will work
5-6 days per week in the eld depending upon the avail-
able bees. The candidate must be both able to work in
a team while also being self-motivated when working
alone. Further, an ideal candidate will be excited about
eld research and be able to live in a relatively secluded
area for the four months, although there are frequent
and available trips to the city as well.
Volunteers/Interns will have food and housing at the
eld site paid for in addition to transportation to eld
site (up to $1000) and be given $200/month stipend
over the four months.
Previous experience in eld work or research is helpful
but not essential.October 1, 2018 EvolDir 83
Panama is a mainly Spanish-speaking country so Span-
ish language skills will be helpful, though they are not
essential.
To apply send a CV and a brief cover letter ex-
plaining why you would be interested in the job to
frances.hunter@aggiemail.usu.edu with the subject head-ing 'Field Intern Job'.

AarhusU StatisticalGenetics
Hi all, I'm advertising for a 2-year postdoc to work
on developing and applying methods for analysis of
genome-wide association study data. Applications by
5th October. A summary below, or for more details see
this link
http://www.au.dk/en/about/vacant-positions/-
scientic-positions/stillinger/Vacancy/show/1001254/-
5283/ |{
Aarhus University is recruiting a 2-year postdoc in sta-
tistical genetics based at the Bioinformatics Research
Centre (BiRC). The provisional starting date is 1st
November 2018.
The postdoc will be jointly supervised by Drs
Doug Speed, Manuel Matthiesen and Sren Dinesen
~Astergaard. There are two broad aims, however the spe-
cic projects will be decided according to the interests
and experience of the successful applicant.
1 - Application of recently developed methods to genome-
wide association study (GWAS) data. Dr Speed has
created the software package LDAK which contains a
variety of methods for analysing GWAS data. These in-
clude the prediction tool MultiBLUP. A possible project
of the postdoc will be applying MultiBLUP to GWAS
data for a large number of traits (e.g., from dbGAP,
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium or UK
Biobank), to compare its performance to that of rival
methods such as polygenic risk scores and LDPred, then
investigate ways MultiBLUP can be improved.
2 - Development of new methods for analysing GWAS
data. Central to LDAK is a method for estimating the
SNP heritability of a trait, the proportion of pheno-
typic variation explained by all SNPs. To date, SNP
heritability has been estimated only for common SNPs
(MAF >0.01), but it is currently unknown how best to
estimate the contribution of rare SNPs. Therefore, a
potential project is investigating how best to estimate
the rare SNP heritability of a trait. First the post-
doc will test methods using simulated data, then apply
the most successful to GWAS data for traits such as
schizophrenia, alzheimer's disease and heart failure.
*Requirements* A PhD degree and strong expertise in
statistical genetics is essential. The position will involve
analysis of large-scale genetic datasets, so the ideal can-
didate would be familiar with popular genetic software
(e.g, PLINK) and at least one coding languages (e.g.
R).*Supervisors* Assistant Professor Doug Speed special-
izes in developing statistical methods for analyzing large
scale GWAS data. He has released the software LDAK
(www.ldak.org) which contains tools for detecting causal
variants, constructing prediction models and better un-
derstanding genetic architecture, using both individual-
level data and summary statistics.
Professor Matthiesen specializes in the analysis of large
scale GWAS data and its clinical interpretation. He is
a physician by training with a specialization in med-
ical genetics, and has a strong background in genetic
epidemiology, biostatistics and molecular genetics.
Professor Sren Dinesen ~Astergaard is a medical doctor
who focuses on psychiatric research. He is particularly
interested in translational psychiatry, and the idea that
studies should cover the full pathway from discovery in
the lab, bench to bedside, bedside to clinical applica-
tions, and from clinical applications to healthcare and
global health.
*Place of work and associated departments* The po-
sition will be primarily based at the Bioinformatics
Research Centre, a department with approximately 50
members focused on the development of statistical mod-
els and computational algorithmns to analyse genetic
data (www.birc.au.dk). The position will also be linked
to the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative
Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH), a consortium in charge
of 50,000 cases for autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipo-
lar disorder and depression (www.ipsych.au.dk) and to
the Department of Clinical Medicine, Denmark's largest
health science institute (www.clin.au.dk/en).
The place of work is C.F. Mllers All e 8, 8000 Aarhus,
and the area of employment is Aarhus University with
related departments.
If you have any questions about the position or applica-
tion procedure, please contact doug@aias.au.dk.

3 year post-doc position Life history consequences of
nest site selection in shorebirds University of Veterinary
Medicine Budapest, Hungary
Background
Choosing nest sites is a major life history decision, sincethe vegetation around the nest inuences both the risk
of predation and the thermal properties of eggs and the
incubating parent. In this project we aim to investigate
nest site selection in a ground nesting shorebird with
biparental incubation, the Kentish plover. Because of
the dierent daily incubation schedule of the sexes, nest
cover can be a sexually antagonistic trait, furthermore
individuals may have consistent preferences for nest
sites. In the project we aim to understand the costs
and benets of this important life history decision, and
its relation to sexual conict and personality of parents.
The project is led by Dr Andras Kosztolanyi (Univ Vet
Med Budapest, Hungary), Prof Zoltan Barta (Univ De-
brecen, Hungary) and Prof Tamas Szekely (Univ Bath,
UK), and will be run in close collaboration with the
'ELVONAL (cutting edge) - Breeding system evolution
in shorebirds' project of the University of Debrecen,
Hungary. The research group uses English as communi-
cation language.
The job
This job oers an opportunity for an early-stage post-
doc who wants to combine eldwork with cutting-edge
evolutionary and behavioural science. The main tasks of
the post-doc are to carry out and supervise eld studies

countries). We seek candidates with experience in be-
havioural ecology and eld biology preferable with birds,
shorebirds. Publications in high-quality peer-reviewed
journals, excellent communication skills, and solid skills

and functional evolution of genes that regulate germ line
stem cells in Drosophila. Our focus is the evolutionary
and functional analysis of bag of marbles (bam), the key
regulatory 'switch' gene for germ line stem cell renewal
or dierentiation in Drosophila. Our work involves the
use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to functionally test
hypotheses of protein function and evolutionary drivers
of strong positive natural selection we discovered acting
on bag of marbles in multiple species and lineages of
Drosophila. Central to our studies are tests of functional
and evolutionary interactions of the intracellular bacte-
ria Wolbachia and germ line stem cell genes, particularly
bag of marbles, across the genus Drosophila. We are also
carrying out computational analyses of the evolutionary
history of Wolbachia infections in Drosophila species.

EMBL Heidelberg
PopulationGenomics
The Project
The Furlong lab, at EMBL Heidelberg, has a funded
post-doctoral position to use natural sequence variation
as a perturbation tool to functionally link enhancers
to their target genes, and uncover new mechanisms in
genome regulation. In our two recent expression QTL
(eQTL) studies (Cannavo et al, Nature 2017, Schor et
al, Nature Genetics 2017)], we demonstrated the power
of Drosophila population genetics to get to causal vari-
ants: the very short blocks of linkage disequilibrium
(LD) provides near base-pair resolution. These studies
provide a proof-of-principle to scale up and perform
a comprehensive large-scale cis and trans embryonic
eQTL study, in a genetically tractable system. Expand-
ing to more genotypes will include rare variants, and
also dramatically increase statistical power to analyze
trans eects. Given the extensive prior knowledge about
gene regulatory networks during Drosophila embryogen-
esis, this is a perfect test system for a large scale trans
analysis. The results should provide new insights into
how the eect of genetic variation propagates through a
developmental network, while in other cases is buered.
The project is at the interface of population genetics,
genome regulation and developmental biology, and is a
collaboration between the groups of Oliver Stegle (com-
putational modelling) and Trudy MacKay. EMBL is
a very international, interdisciplinary institute with a
very open, collaborative and vibrant culture. Working
language is English. See http://furlonglab.embl.de/ for
more info about the lab.92 EvolDir October 1, 2018
Your Role
Your role is to lead and drive this exciting project. Ini-
tially this will involve the sample collection, in collabo-
ration with the MacKay lab, and then the sequencing at
EMBL, with the help of our Genomics Core facility. You
would then work in collaboration with the Stegle group
to perform the QTL analysis using new computational
models. In the second phase of the project, you would
perform cutting edge genome engineering (or collaborate
with someone in the Furlong group) to experimentally
test model predictions.
You Should Have
You should have an excellent track record from your
Ph.D., with strong expertise in population genetics. You
need to be very organised, and be able to lead and drive
big ambitious projects, while at the same time being
very collaborative and open.
Why Join us
The Furlong group is a mixture of experimental and
computational biologists at the interface of Transcrip-
tion/Chromatin Biology and Developmental Biology.
We have a great working atmosphere with lots of collab-
orations and friends within the group. The Furlong lab
also has an excellent track record for post-docs within
the lab obtaining faculty positions ( >70% - see the
Alumni on the lab's web site). EMBL is a unique place
with a very friendly, collaborative, open door policy.
The excellent colleagues and core facilities make your
research interesting, productive and fun. We also have
an excellent day care on campus.

Eco-evolutionary dynamics of pushed propagation waves
- INRA Sophia Antipolis, France Propagation waves are
classically described as \pulled", their expansion being
driven by the reproduction and dispersal of few indi-
viduals on the edge of the propagation front. However,
recent work in theoretical ecology highlighted the ex-
istence of \pushed" waves, in which individuals from
the core of the population are involved in its expansion.
Allee eects were the rst mechanism associated with
the emergence of pushed waves, and recent results from
our team demonstrated that mechanisms like positive
density-dependent dispersal or dispersal stochasticity
could also induce pushed expansions. However, the
frequency of pushed expansions in nature and their
consequences on invasion dynamics are still unknown.
This project aims at understanding better the spread
and evolutionary dynamics of pushed propagation waves,
with complimentary theoretical and experimental ap-
proaches. Several datasets on experimental invasions
of Trichogramma (minute hymenopteran wasp) in lab-
oratory microcosms are available in our team, as well
as individual-based modelling frameworks. The post-
doctoral project would consist mainly in analyzing thesedatasets and adjusting the numerical simulations ac-
cordingly, with the potential for at least 4 publications.
In addition, theoretical developments (ABC analyses)
focused on the denition of empirical indicators of the
pulled/pushed nature of propagation waves could be
included in the project. Alternatively, depending on the
post-doctoral fellow's own interests, new experiments
could be carried out with the support of our technical
sta.
Required prole:
- PhD in ecology or equivalent eld
- general background in population dynamics or genetics
- statistical analyses (R)
- solid writing/publication experience
- interest for invasion biology and theoretical ecology
Experience in individual-based modelling would be ap-
preciated but is not required.
Location: INRA is an applied research institute spe-
cialized in agronomical and crop protection issues. The
team \Biology of Introduced Populations" uses pop-
ulation dynamics and genetics approaches to address
theoretical predictions regarding biological invasions and
biological control. The research environment is stim-
ulating, with several teams on-site working in ecology
and evolution, and frequent collaborations with other
labs in France and abroad.
Sophia-Antipolis is the largest high-tech R&D hub in
France, ideally located on the French Riviera. The area
is famous for its mild climate, and its year-round out-
door activites: swimming, diving, mountain hiking, or
skiing are all available close by. Nice, Antibes or Cannes
are the main cities around and are easily reached by
public transportation.
Organization: The post-doctoral fellowship is supported
by funding from the main French funding agency (ANR),
which will also cover for project expenses (experiments,
interns, conferences; ). Funding is available for 2 years
(2 periods of 1 year), and includes health benets from
the French social security system. Starting date ne-
gotiable, from January 1 ^st 2019. Net salary will be
between 2200-2800euro depending on experience.

IowaStateU EvolutionaryGenomics
A postdoctoral position in comparative, evolutionary
genomics is available in the Huord Lab at Iowa State
University with remote advising from the Hirsch Lab
at the University of Minnesota. This is a multi-year
position with support from two recently awarded NSF
Plant Genome Research Program grants. Projects will
include:
1) Generation and comparison of maize landrace genome
assemblies from high and low elevation regions in Mexico
and South America. The lines that will be assembled
have served as parents of two mapping populations
currently under evaluation to assess the genetic archi-
tecture of highland adaptation traits. Assembly of these
parental lines will inform our understanding of the role
of structural, presence-absence, and copy-number varia-
tion in determining highland phenotypes.
2) Use of 25 whole genome de novo assemblies in a com-
parative genomics framework to determine the struc-
tural variation underlying tropical and temperate adap-
tation in maize. We are currently completing de novo
assemblies for these lines, which collectively comprise
the founders of the maize Nested Association Mapping
(NAM) population.
The chosen applicant will lead a team of scientists in
generating peer-reviewed publications on both projects
described above. Ideally, we seek applicants with ex-
perience working with next generation sequencing data
(particularly, long-read PacBio and/or Nanopore data)
and in large-scale computational biology (procient in
UNIX, R, Python). A strong background in evolution-
ary biology is also required. Documented ability to
coordinate collaborative research is highly desirable.
Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, contact in-
formation for three references, and a cover letter to

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral fellow posi-
tion studying the genomic basis of variation in human
complex traits.
The postdoc will join a research group led by Rajiv
McCoy in the Department of Biology at Johns Hopkins
University. Our lab develops computational and statis-
tical methods to investigate the functional and tness
eects of human genetic variation. We are also interested
in the evolutionary mechanisms by which such variation
persists in nature. Within this scope, specic research
topics include the study of aneuploidy, the leading cause
of pregnancy loss. This includes research into the origins
and phenotypic consequences of mosaic aneuploidy and
structural variation'Xa potential hidden source of hu-
man phenotypic diversity. A second research direction
focuses on the functional genomic basis of phenotypic
divergence. Past and ongoing work uses introgression
among archaic (Neandertal and Denisovan) and modern
humans as a model to study this evolutionary process.
The postdoc will be supported in developing new re-
search directions broadly consistent with these themes.
In addition to research, opportunities are available to
gain experience in teaching and mentoring. The post-
doc will also receive guidance and support for career
development, tailored to long-term goals.

Job description The Natural History Museum at the Uni-
versity of Oslo announces three fellowships connected to
a project funded under the 'Toppforsk Program', jointly
nanced by the Research Council of Norway and the
Natural History Museum: 'SpeciationClock: How fast
does the 'speciation clock' tick in selng versus outcross-
ing lineages?' The project addresses how and how long
it takes for new, reproductively isolated plant species to
arise and what factors inuence the rate of speciation.
More about the project and positions The project is
organized in four work packages (WPs) which will 1)
establish a theoretical framework to understand and
predict the eects of mating system on the speciation
process, 2) measure the rate of accumulation of intraspe-
cic postzygotic reproductive isolation (RI) in a large
set of species representing the selng-outcrossing spec-
trum and divergence times spanning the last ~1 million
years, 3) test if the rate at which RI loci accumulate is
higher in selfers, and 4) quantify the role that selection
has played on RI loci using population genomic analyses
in one selng and one outcrossing species. We have
selected the tropical African 'sky archipelago' as a study
system because the populations in these isolated high
mountains represent a wide range of divergence times
and levels of intermountain gene ow. Field experi-
ments and collection of material for the SpeciationClock
project will be conducted during two long eld seasons,
starting in the Ethiopian mountains in October 2018.
The project also includes extensive cultivation and cross-
ing experiments, genomic analyses, and niche modeling
through time.
One of the postdoctoral fellowships (Postdoc no. 1) an-
nounced here is a two-year fellowship connected to WP1.
The selected candidate for this position will be based at
the NHM in Oslo, but will spend considerable parts of
the time in France working with the WP1 Leader, Dr.
Sylvain Gl emin at the ECOBIO lab at the University
of Rennes.
The other postdoctoral fellowship (Postdoc no. 2) is a
three-year fellowship primarily connected to WP2, but
will also contribute to WP3 and WP4.
The PhD fellowship is a four-year fellowship, of which
75% of the time will be devoted to the PhD programme,
mainly connected to WP3 and WP4, and 25% of the
time will be devoted to duty work for the museum98 EvolDir October 1, 2018
(teaching, public outreach, collection work).
Principal investigator (PI): Christian Brochmann, Nat-
ural History Museum. Co-PI: Anne K. Brysting, Centre

partment of Biosciences.
Who are we looking for? We seek highly motivated,
enthusiastic persons with good social skills and with the
ambition to gain new insights and to publish papers in
leading international journals.
You will be part of a team with two researchers, three
postdocs, one PhD fellow, and several international

understand the impact of evolutionary history on ge-
netic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities:
A successful candidate will develop and apply compu-
tational approaches to large genomic datasets to char-
acterize patterns of population history and evolution.

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Population Genomics
A two-year postdoctoral fellowship is available at the Sec-
tion for Computational and RNA Biology, Department
of Biology, University of Copenhagen. The position
will be available from January 1st, 2019 or as soon as
possible thereafter. The specic project involves analyz-
ing population genomic samples of the musk ox ( focus
species) and the African bualo. However, the applicant
is expected to collaborate on other projects as well as
teaching.
The project is a central part of \How species man-
age to persist on the edge of extinction", which is a
project funded by the Independent Research Fund Den-
mark. The project focuses on genomic dynamics and
genetic load in species that have been through extreme
bottlenecks and lost a signicant part of their genetic
diversity. This has happened to the muskox in East
Greenland, without any signs of inbreeding depression.
In the project, we will use comparative population ge-
nomics to assess loss of genetic diversity, accumulation
of harmful genetic variants and inbreeding in species
that experience extreme genetic drift. For comparison,
we use a non- bottlenecked species, the African bualo
as a reference.

UEdinburgh EvolutionaryGenetics
Two Postdoctoral Positions in Evolutionary Genetics
Highly motivated candidates are invited to join the
group of Peter Keightley to work on the evolutionary im-
pact of spontaneous mutations. As the ultimate source
of genetic variation, new mutations play a central role
in evolutionary biology. The nature of variation from
mutations is key to many unresolved questions, includ-
ing the fate of small populations, the evolution of ageing
and the genetic basis of quantitative trait variation.
We aim to study two unique resources developed in our
lab, in which mutations are expected to accumulate at
radically dierent rates. The rst is a highly replicated
set of spontaneous mutation accumulation (MA) lines in
mice, the rst such set of lines in any mammalian species.
Each MA line is bred for many generations in the near-
absence of natural selection, leading to molecular and
phenotypic divergence among lines. The second is a set
of replicated MA lines (maintained for ~1,000 genera-
tions) in dierent strains and species of the single-celled
green alga Chlamydomonas. We will address questions
concerning the nature of the new mutational variation
aecting the genome, gene expression and quantitative
traits, and particularly the distribution of tness eects
of mutations. The project is exible and can be tailored
to the interests of successful applicants.
Applicants should have or shortly obtain a PhD in a
relevant subject, e.g., evolutionary or quantitative genet-
ics. Experience in bioinformatics will be an advantage.
Candidates should have an outstanding academic track
record commensurate with their career stage and expe-
rience. She/he is expected to be active in developing
the project and to contribute to an enthusiastic working
atmosphere. Candidates will benet from training in
a vibrant intellectual and collaborative environment in
the UK's largest evolutionary biology institute. The
project is funded by an ERC Advanced Grant to Peter
Keightley and Diethard Tautz (MPI Ploen, Germany)
and has substantial funds for computing, sequencing
and travel. The positions are for 3 years with expected
start dates of 1st Jan 2019.October 1, 2018 EvolDir 111

PhyloComparativeMethods
Postdoctoral Position at the University of Minnesota,
Twin Cities
A postdoctoral researcher is sought to develop phyloge-
netic comparative methods and apply them to studies
of plant macroevolution. This project is a collaboration
between the labs of Emma Goldberg at the University of
Minnesota (where the position will be based), Itay May-
rose at Tel Aviv University, Tracy Heath at Iowa State
University, and Heath Blackmon at Texas A&M Univer-
sity. More information about our labs is available at <
http://www.umn.edu/ ~eeg>,<http://www.tau.ac.il/-
~itaymay >,<http://www.phyloworks.org >, and <
http://coleoguy.github.io >.
The work will focus on improving and applying methods
for testing the inuence of traits on lineage diversica-
tion. One line of attack is developing new model-based
phylogenetic comparative methods, targeting known
weaknesses in existing approaches. The other is cre-
ating tools for more robust use of existing and future
methods, including designing benchmark test suites and
tests of model adequacy. Empirical work will make
use of extensive datasets on plant reproductive systems
and chromosome counts, and it has the potential to
make one of the strongest cases yet for the importance
of species selection. The postdoc will also contribute
to new workshops teaching phylogenetic comparative
methods, to be held in the Midwest US and in Israel.
Relevant skills and knowledge include: macroevolution
of reproductive systems and genome structure; phyloge-
netic comparative methods use and development; math-
ematics of stochastic processes; computational statistics;
database and user interface design; programming in R,
RevBayes, and C++; software for testing macroevo-
lutionary hypotheses; software tools for reproducible
research workows; writing clearly for both technical
and general readers; teaching in a computer lab setting.
Expertise is not required in all these areas, however!
We are generally looking for a biologist with macroevo-
lutionary interests and good technical problem-solving
skills.
Initial appointment will be for one year with competitive
salary and benets. Renewal for another year is possible,
pending excellent performance and mutual agreement.116 EvolDir October 1, 2018
The start date is exible. To apply, please assemble
(i) a 1-3 page cover letter that highlights how your re-
search interests and skills t with this project, (ii) a
CV, and (iii) names and contact information for three
professional references. Materials should be submitted
online at <http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/employment/

The School of Archaeology, South Parks Road, Oxford
Grade 7: Salary in the range 32,236 - 38,460 p.a.
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research
Assistant position as part of a Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC) grant entitled: 'The Con-
sequences of Gene Flow between Wild and Domestic
Populations during Livestock Evolution'. By directly
characterising the genetic variation in wild and domestic
pigs over the past 10,000 years, this project will reveal
not only the genomic basis for domestication, but also
how domestic pigs adapt to novel environments as they
were introduced to regions outside of the areas where
they were initially domesticated.
This project will assess the DNA preservation of more
than 1,000 ancient pigs and wild boar from Eastern
and Western Eurasia over the past 10,000 years, and
then sequence the entire genomes of the best-preserved
specimens. Armed with this data, we will establish the
spatial and temporal dierences in the proportion, and
genomic location of the incorporation of wild boar genes
into domestic stocks. The results will allow not only an
unprecedented understanding of the origins of domestic
animals, they will also have important ramications for
the conservation of endangered wild boar populations
and for pig breeders and pork consumers for whom theauthenticity of domestic and wild meat is crucial.
The successful candidate will be based in Oxford at the
Palaeogenomics and Bio-Archaeology Research Network
(Palaeo-BARN) and will join a multi-disciplinary team
of archaeologist and geneticists under the supervision of
Professor Greger Larson. Working alongside Professor
Keith Dobney (Liverpool), Dr Laurent Frantz (Queen
Mary), and a PDRA specialising in bioinformatics, the
successful candidate will take a leading role in the sam-
pling strategy and will also be expected to use their
initiative and creativity to identify areas for research
development and extend their research portfolio.
The post is a full-time appointment for a xed-term of
3 years.
Applicants must have a PhD in evolutionary genetics,
animal genomics, population genomics, or related disci-
pline. A demonstrated track record of wet lab experience
and publications is desirable, as is experience working

satellite meeting 'Towards an integrated concept of adap-
tation: uniting molecular population genetics and quan-
titative genetics' 11-14 February 2019 in Vienna, Aus-
tria.
This workshop will bring together theoreticians and
empiricists, covering both molecular population genet-
ics and quantitative genetics, with the implicit goal to
develop the basis for a unied framework of adaptive
genetic architectures. The new concept will in turn
provide predictions that translate into guidelines for
the most informative experimental designs, to uncover
underlying adaptive processes.We will have talks by invited speakers from both theoret-
ical and empirical elds (Drosophila, yeast, Arabidopsis,
human, sticklebacks, domestic animals). We will also
have discussions in working groups on development of
the new unied concept of adaptive traits and nding
new analytical approaches.
Registration: Since the meeting is sponsored by SMBE
and Vetmeduni Vienna, we can waive the registration fee
for all participants. However, registration is compulsory.
Registration deadline: Dec 31, 2018.
Abstract Submission: For contributed talks, submit your
250-words abstract by Oct 31, 2018. The deadline for
submission of 250-words abstracts for posters is Dec 31,

Nov26-30
Dear all,
we will run a LANDSCAPE GENOMICS course in
Berlin, 26-30 November 2018, in the contaxt of the beau-
tiful botanical gerden/Freie Universit at Berlin K onigin-
Luise-Strae 6-8.
Our INSTRUCTORS for this course are:
1) Dr. St ephane Joost (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
2) Oliver Selmoni, MSc (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Course overview
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, the course
will discuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic
data and subsequently show how to study genetic vari-
ation and population structure across space in the R
environment. Students will be given an overview of the
dierent statistical approaches to study local adapta-
tion, and will be trained in using two of them, Sambada
and LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task
of the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-
nally, the course will consider the crucial aspects and
good habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This course is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneti-
cists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evo-
lutionary biology and conservation. Even though the
course is not intended for a specialized audience, basic
knowledge in evolutionary biology and population ge-
netics would help. Students will learn how to use GIS,
but basic computer skills are desirable (e.g. in the R
environment). A basic understanding of statistics is also
necessary.
Teaching FormatOctober 1, 2018 EvolDir 127
The course is organized in ten learning sessions. During
the rst two sessions, the course will provide a contex-
tualization of the research eld. Then, students will be
guided through a landscape genomics experiment with
sessions that couple brief theoretical introductions with
practical work.

ologists course in Berlin this October (15-19): https://-
www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/course2/
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
biologists)
Course overview
This course is aimed at complete beginners and assumes
no prior programming experience. It gives an overview
of the language with an emphasis on practical problem-
solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various
aspects of bioinformatics work. After completing the
course, students should be in a position to (1) apply the
skills they have learned to tackling problems in their
own research and (2) continue their Python education
in a self-directed way. All course materials (including
copies of presentations, practical exercises, data les,
and example scripts prepared by the instructing team)
will be provided electronically to participants.Assumed background:
Students should have enough biological background to
appreciate the examples and exercise problems (i.e. they
should know about DNA and protein sequences, what
translation is, and what introns and exons are). No
previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary,
but you'll need to have a laptop with Python installed.

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the course 'PYTHON
MACHINE LEARNING IN BIOLOGY'.
Instructor: Nichole Bennett (The University of Texas at
Austin, USA) Dates: December 3rd-7th, 2018 Location:
Heraklion, Crete (Greece)
COURSE OVERVIEW:
The eld of biological sciences is becoming increasingly
information-intensive and data-rich. For example, the
growing availability of DNA sequence data or clinical
measurements from humans promises a better under-
standing of the important questions in biology. However,
the complexity and high-dimensionality of these biologi-

Online UManchester Morphometrics
Nov5-Dec14
Dear colleagues
I would like to remind you of this year's morphometrics
course from the University of Manchester. This year's
course will run in the six weeks from 5 November to 14
December 2018.
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Denitions
of size and shape * Geometric methods to characterise
shape from a conguration of landmark points (Pro-
crustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation, scat-
ter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal com-
ponent analysis * Measurement error and outliers *
Shape transformations and 'warping' { the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing
between groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) *
Allometry and size correction * Inuence of external
factors on shape (ecomorphology, dose- response studies)
* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics
of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives,
QTL analyses. * Phylogeny: examining the history of
evolutionary changes of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses usingthe MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.

Phylogenetic comparative methods are commonly used
nowadays to investigate how species diversication oc-October 1, 2018 EvolDir 131
curs and test hypotheses about the mechanisms that
drive phenotypic evolution, e.g. to model speciation and
extinction, to understand why some groups are more
diverse than others, to test whether phenotypic traits
have evolved under neutral, directional or diversifying
selection, to investigate how evolutionary rates are mod-
ied across the evolutionary history of a group etc. In
all these cases, a phylogenetic hypothesis for the group
of interest is combined to phenotypic and ecological data
at the species level to understand the tempo and mode
of evolutionary change.
The objective of this course is to provide an overview
of these methods and of the tools available for their
implementation in the R statistical language. During
theoretical sessions, we will review the main concepts
and statistical tools necessary for testing hypotheses
about species diversication and phenotypic evolution.
These will then be implemented in practical lab sessions
through worked examples to provide the participants
with hands-on experience on data management and the
implementation of these methods to real biological data.
A good knowledge of basic operations in R (le import,
handling objects, using functions, getting help) is re-
quired and assumed to be able to adequately follow this
course. BIODIV students are encouraged to take the

When: 19-23 November 2018
Where: Institut de Biologie Integrative et des Systemes
(IBIS), Laval University, Quebec City (Quebec), Canada
Instructors:
Dr. Vasco Elbrecht (University of Guelph, Canada)
Eric Normandeau (Laval University, Canada)
Website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course40/ Course Overview
After completing the workshop, students should be in a
position to (1) understand the potential and capabilities
of eDNA barcoding and metabarcoding, (2) run com-
plete analyses of eDNA metabarcoding pipelines and ob-
tain diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable
data from raw next-generation sequence data and (3) de-
sign their own eDNA projects, including bioinformatic
data analysis and planning of laboratory work. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-132 EvolDir October 1, 2018
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
While this course will focus on eDNA metabarcoding,
however targeted single species detection and other al-
ternatives will also be explored, as they can sometimes
be suitable metabarcoding alternatives.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research, and researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing eDNA
community. This workshop will review mostly tech-
niques and software useful for eukaryotic single species
detection and eDNA metabarcoding. Other workshops
focused on procedures currently used in bulk sample and
microbial metabarcoding will be available from Physalia-
courses. A survey will be provided 2 weeks ahead of
the workshop, where participants can mention topics or
aspects they are particularity interested in.
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments. Please make
sure to have linux installed if you bring a Windows
based laptop. Among the software and tools we will
be using is R or Rstudio (+ the JAMP & PrimerMiner
package), FastQC, Usearch, Vsearch, Cutadapt, and
mBRAVE.net. No prior knowledge of these software
packages is required.
TEACHING FORMAT
The workshop is delivered over 5 days (see the detailed
curriculum below). The lectures are interactive with
active discussion where asking questions is strongly en-
couraged. A key aspect of this course are practical
sessions in primer development, bioinformatic analysis
of high throughput sequence data, and data visualiza-
tion as well as a project planning exercise to apply what
you learned in this course.

Description
Date: Tuesday 23rd October, University College Lon-
don, 10am-4.30pm
Tutors: Prof David Balding (Melbourne and UGI) and
Dr Doug Speed (Aarhus and UGI)
Cost: 40 (or 30 for UCL Members)
Advance Registration is REQUIRED
*
*Background: *In recent years there has been great
progress in developing genome-wide statistical analyses
for detecting causal variants, constructing prediction
models and better understanding the genetic architec-
ture of complex traits. However the underlying regres-
sion models involve very large numbers of predictors,
and strong modelling assumptions are required to tackle
the consequent problem of over-tting. The results can
be sensitive to these assumptions, and also to the eects
of population structure, genotyping errors and the extent
to which rare SNPs are included. Recently-developed
methods based on summary statistics are susceptible to
similar problems
*Course outline: *We will cover genome-wide associa-
tion analysis, including latest developments in confound-
ing adjustments, and heritability analyses, both using
individual-level genetic data (GCTA, LDAK) and us-
ing summary statistics (LDSC, SumHer). We will also
cover assessing heritability enrichment in functionally-October 1, 2018 EvolDir 133
annotated regions, genetic correlation and risk pre-
diction (e.g., polygenic risk scores, BLUP and Multi-
BLUP). We will emphasise the common elements of
these methods, highlighting a standard framework that
has emerged for genome-wide SNP analysis, while also
contrasting the dierences in modelling assumptions
underlying the dierent software.
The practicals will provide step-by-step details for
analysing genetic data, starting either with indvidual-
level data (e.g., PLINK les or the output from IM-
PUTE2) or summary statistics (p-values from a GWAS).
There will be a selection of worked examples; to take
part in the practicals, participants should bring a laptop
with either MAC or LINUX OS
*Prerequisites:* Participants should be procient in
statistics including some familiarity with random-eects
regression models. In genetics, knowledge of SNP geno-
types and Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium will
be assumed. Computer scripts and output will be dis-
cussed that assume some familiarity with scientic com-
puting using linux. Some familiarity with PLINK would
be helpful but is not essential.
*Provisional Timetable*
*10:00 - 12:20: Lecture 1 followed by Practical 1*
Introduction to analysing GWAS data analysis using
individual genotype data, kinship and heritability, both
classical and SNP-based. Eect of LD, MAF and geno-
typing quality on heritability. GCTA and LDAK soft-
ware.
*12:20 - 13:00: Lunch*
*13.00 - 14:40: Lecture 2 followed by Practical 2*
Methods based on summary statistics, assessing the ef-
fects of confounding in association analysis, enrichment
of functional categories. LDSC, SumHer softwares
*14:40 - 15:00: Break*
*15.00 - 16:30: Lecture 3 followed by Practical 3 *
Genetic correlations, genomic prediction and enhanced
polygenic risk scores.

Postgraduate Course on ^ aCommunity and Ecosystem
Dynamics'
This is the second announcement of the winter school
for PhD students and Postdocs on Linking Commu-
nity and Ecosystem Dynamics organized by Research
School Ecology & Evolution of the Groningen Institute
for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES; University of
Groningen, Netherlands).
The school will be held in the University eld station
^ aHerdershut' on the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog
from October 21 - 26 2018.
We are very happy to announce that this year we
will have two special guest lecturers: Dr <https://-
trishaatwood.weebly.com/people.html >Trisha B At-
wood (Utah State University) and Dr <http://-
www.shaipilosof.info/ >Shai Pilosof (University of
Chicago).
Dr Atwood is assistant professor and chair of the Aquatic
Ecology and Global Change Lab. She and her team
members are interested in three broad research themes
across all aquatic ecosystems (marine, estuarine, fresh-
water, and riparian zones). 1. The eects of global
change on aquatic food webs and species interactions.
2. How food webs and species interactions inuence
ecosystem function. 3. The role of aquatic ecosystems
in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conserva-
tion.
By focusing on these three broad questions, her research
has taken her all over the world with studies in Hawaii,
Canada, Costa Rica, and Australia (including The Great
Barrier Reef).
Dr Pilosof is postdoctoral scholar at the University of
Chicago, ^ athe lab of Mercedes Pascual. He is mostly
interested in the application of network theory to ecolog-
ical systems, specically in the eld of disease ecology.
He uses a complex systems approach to study the fac-
tors that eect spread of disease in animal communities
and from animals to humans. His research is unique as
it takes the individual point of view: 1. What is the
role of individual heterogeneity in shaping host-parasite
interactions at the community level? 2. How does ge-
netic variation aect infection with parasites in dierent
hosts? 3. How does individual heterogeneity translate134 EvolDir October 1, 2018
to eciency of disease spread in host communities?
Scope of the course
The research elds community and ecosystem ecology
have diverged more or less independently over the last
decennia. In community ecology progress is made in
understanding shifts in community composition under
the inuence of environmental change and how these
shifts can be explained by functional trait approaches
of component species. Also, the importance of positive
feedbacks in community dynamics is more and more
appreciated, and merged with trophic interactions in
ecological networks. Studies in ecosystem ecology tra-
ditionally have a strong focus on energy and nutrient
uxes and how deviation in these uxes aect ecosystem
functioning and stability. Recent studies reveal tight
links between these sub-disciplines that enforce us to
rethink how communities and ecosystems interact.
This course focuses on theoretical concepts, such as au-
tocatalytic loops and positive and negative feedbacks
between organisms in ecological networks as well as the
importance of non-trophic interactions by ecosystem
engineers. The course will address how these principles
can be used to link communities to ecosystems enabling
a better understanding of how environmental changes
aect community and ecosystem dynamics. Students
will construct ecological networks of their own study
system or based on literature data and analyze these
using structural equation modelling.
Course Set-up
The course is composed of a series of lectures, a poster
session, analyzing ecological networks using structural
equation modelling and nalized with a debating session.
Poster session: Prior to the course, participants submit
a poster of their work (A4-size) in PDF, which will be
printed and included in the course reader. The poster
contains your name and aliation, title and short de-
scription of research project (including concepts) with
one highlight (something exciting) and the reason you
want to participate in this course. During the course,
participants briey pitch their research (maximum 3
slides) and indicate where they would like to receive
input from the course participants and lecturers.
Lectures and discussion: Each day starts with a key
speaker who will give a lecture on one of the key course
topics (covering both general theory and own research).
After the lecture we'll have a discussion which is con-
vened by three participants who challenge the speaker on
the lecture and two papers that the speaker submitted
which are related to the topic of the lecture (participants
will receive these before the course to prepare them self).Group activities: In the afternoons, participants will be
split into working groups, which will work on specic
group assignments

\Introduction to bioinformatics using Linux (IBUL03)"
Delivered by Dr. Martin Jones
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-to-
linux-workows-fo r-biologists-ibul03/
Course Overview:
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lift-
ing { genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation
tools { are designed to work best when used with a
command-line interface. Because the command line can
be an intimidating environment, many biologists learn
the bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools
working. This means that they miss out on the power
of Linux to customize their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
