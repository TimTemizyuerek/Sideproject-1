CALL FOR SYMPOSIA for 2006 Conference on
Genomes, Evolution, and Bioinformatics (ANNUAL
SMBE MEETING 2006)
The 2006 annual meeting of the Society for Molecular
Biology and Evolution will be held from May 24-28,
2006, at the Arizona State University in Tempe. The
Organizing Committee invites individuals to present
their proposals for potential symposia ideas. Symposia
proposals should include:
Cover sheet including symposium title and all informa-
tion for point of contact Brief abstract including clear
description of topic and rationale for its presentation to
the society Identify up to four potential participants,
aﬃliations, and what each may contribute
Successful proposals will be identiﬁed based on their
clarity, innovation, and relevance to the theme of the
2006 meeting: Genomics, Evolution, and Bioinformat-
ics. In addition, proposals that support an emerging
ﬁeld or discipline that reﬂects the unique and speciﬁcinterests of the SMBE will also be targeted. Both the
society and the committee are especially interested in
proposals that highlight diversity in science and include
underrepresented groups.
Each symposium will three or six speakers, with each
speaker allotted 25 minutes (plus 5 minutes for ques-
tions). The organizers will provide support for the sym-
posium proposer and invited speakers in the form of
registration fees. In exceptional cases, the conference
organizers are also prepared to provide hotel and air-
fare reimbursements for invited speakers. All proposals
will be considered in the order submitted and proposers
will be notiﬁed of the committee’s decision at the latest
by November 15, 2005.
All queries and the symposia proposals should be ad-
dressed to symposia@smbe.org. Proposals may be re-
ceived as a Word or PDF attachment via email and
must be received on or before November 1, 2005.

Edinburgh PopGenetics Dec2005 2
This is to remind you that the deadline is getting close
for registration and payment for the Population Genet-
ics Group meeting, in Edinburgh, December 2005
The deadline is November 7th
There will be three plenary speakers
Wolfgang Stephan (Munich) Population genetics of
adaptation
Gil McVean (Oxford) The causes and consequences of
human recombination hotspots
Patrice David (Montpellier) Quantitative genetics
of traits controlling selﬁng and outcrossing in
hermaphroditic snails
The web site
http://web.bio.ed.ac.uk/public/conferences/-
PopulationGenetics2005/index.html gives all details
that are currently available (the programme will
appear close to the date of the meeting). It is possible4 EvolDir November 1, 2005
to complete both registration and payment parts
together, or at separate times, but all accommodation
bookings will be provisional until you have paid.
Please note that the correct information about how to
select the Pop Group in the payment site is as follows
(the pdf and Word versions that are available from the
web site are both correct, but an earlier version had
diﬀerent information, because the university changed
things slightly after I had sent out the ﬁrst announce-
ment):
>After entering your email and other details as
prompted, you get a >page to select the ’product’ you
want to pay for. From the left hand >pull-down menu,
select Institute of Evolutionary Biology, and from >the
right-hand menu select Conferences, and then the lower
menu>shows the Pop Group.
Update of the information about arrival, computers and
Poster boards. Arrival Go to the Reception desk of the
James Watt Centre. They will direct you to the Regis-
tration desk, which will be open from 2pm. The build-
ing will be closed at 9pm, but there is a bell (on the left
of the entrance) for the night porter (all night). The
Reception desk or the night porter will give room keys.
Guests may check in to their accommodation from 1400
on the day of arrival and are asked to vacate bedrooms
and return keys to reception by 1000 on the day of de-
parture.
The registration desk for the meeting will be open in
the main reception foyer just outside James Watt Cen-
tre from 1400-2200.
Computers The meeting rooms have a built-in projec-
tion system, and we will provide Macintosh computers
for those who prefer them. We prefer people to bring
their talks on a CD or ’data stick’ and to load them
onto one of the computers, at the latest in the break
before their session. If you are bringing your own com-
puter, however, for your talk, or other uses, remember
that non-UK equipment will require an adaptor, be-
cause UK sockets are quite diﬀerent from those else-
where in Europe.
Poster boards The boards measure 1.2m x 1.8m and
have a blue felt backing which requires posters to be
aﬃxed by using either hook velcro or pins. If you are
presenting a poster, please email me whether it is to be
upright or ’landscape’ format.

*We are pleased to announce the ﬁrst and founding
meeting of the *European society for Evolutionary De-
velopmental biology (EED) *Plenary talks-Symposia-
Contributed sessions-Poster sessions
Costs will be kept as low as possible.
The aim of the society is to promote evolutionary de-
velopmental biology by regularly organizing meetings
on this subject in Europe, perhaps alternating with the

LundU PlantSystematics
PhD studentship (utbildningsbidrag) in Plant Ecology
and Systematics
A four-year PhD studentship, funded by the Faculty of
Science, Lund University, is available at the Section for
Plant Ecology and Systematics, Department of Ecol-
ogy, for studies of evolutionary implications of pollen
competition in a species with delayed stigma receptiv-
ity.In recent years, increasing interest in conﬂicts between
the sexes in relation to reproduction has lead to im-
portant evolutionary insights. In plants, however, few
studies have considered the potential for conﬂicts be-
tween sexual functions. During pollen competition,
pollen traits that confer a selective advantage should
be selected even when this would disfavour the in-
terests of the female function. The proposed project
will use greenhouse experiments to study evolutionary
implications of pollen competition in an annual plant
species with delayed stigma receptivity (Collinsia het-
erophylla). Particular attention will be given to the
ability of pollen to germinate earlier than pollen from
other donors, the consequences of delayed stigma re-
ceptivity for female function, and the timing of recep-
tivity in relation to the origin of the pollen donor and
recipient. The heritability of the ability of pollen to
germinate early during the stigmatic phase as well as
the heritability of the timing of stigma receptivity will
also be quantiﬁed.
The duties of the student include (up to 10%) under-
graduate teaching and a certain amount of administra-
tion.
We are seeking a candidate holding a B.Sc. degree (or
equivalent) in biology or a related subject, and having a
strong interest in plant ecology, evolution and genetics.
Experience of ﬁeld- or greenhouse work as well as of
general laboratory work is an advantage. Possession of
a driving-license, and social and cooperative skills are
also considered important.
The application should be written us-

We are seeking a PhD student for a Royal Society of
New Zealand Marsden Fund project on the compara-
tive phylogeography of New Zealand forest insects. The
project will involve a combination of ﬁeld work, insect
identiﬁcation, DNA sequencing, and associated phylo-
genetic and population genetic analyses. We aim to re-
construct the response of forest insects to recent glacial
advances and test hypotheses on the nature of glacial
refugia. The student will join an international team of
biologists and geologists working on the eﬀects of glacial
environmental change on the New Zealand biota.
The Ph.D. student will be based at Landcare Research
on the Auckland University campus at Tamaki and
will be enrolled at Auckland University through the
Centre for Biodiversity and Biosecurity. They will re-
ceive training in ﬁeld entomology, taxonomy, molec-
ular systematics and population genetics. The stu-
dent will be jointly supervised by Thomas Buckley and

ReadingU PopulationGenetics
A PhD position is available in the School of Biologi-
cal Sciences, working with Mark Beaumont. This stu-
dentship is fully funded for any applicants from the EU
(fees and stipend). It is also available to applicants out-
side the EU, but they will need to pay for the diﬀerence
between EU and non-EU fees (around 6,000 per year).
The student will be working on a project funded by
a grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC) in conjunction with David
Balding in the Department of Epidemiology and Public
Health at Imperial College, London. The student will
be working closely with a postdoctoral researcher at
Imperial College, funded on the same grant. The aim
of the project is to develop and apply novel statistical
methods (mainly based on what has come to be called
’approximate Bayesian computatation’, ABC) for the
analysis of genetic data. The problems we are partic-
ularly interested in relate to ﬁtting complex models of
demographic history to genetic data. Training will be
provided in population genetics, bioinformatics, and on
the application of modern methods of computational
statistics and simulation in biology.

ULausanne EvolGeneticsSymbiosis
PhD studentship: in Molecular Genetics & Symbiosis
We are seeking a highly motivated student with a back-
ground in molecular biology to join our group working
on mechanisms of evolution in symbiotic mycorrhizal
fungi. These important fungi form mutualistic sym-
bioses with plant roots. Although the fungi grow clon-
ally, they have a highly unusual genome organization,
harbouring genetically diﬀerent nuclei that are passed
from one generation to the next (see Hijri & Sanders,
Nature 2005; Kuhn, Hijri & Sanders, Nature 2001).
The goals of our research are to understand how this
unusual organization of the genome aﬀects their evolu-
tion and their adaptation to the diﬀerent environments
oﬀered by the roots of diﬀerent plant species. Other
than their unusual genome organization, the fungi have
formed symbioses with plants ever since they colonized
land over 400 million years ago and are thought to be
the oldest putative ancient asexuals.
The candidate should be familiar with molecular biol-
ogy and have an interest in applying this knowledge to
evolutionary questions. He/she should also be able to
interact with the other group members working on evo-
lution and population biology of mycorrhizal fungi (see
list of recent papers on our web site).
The successful candidate will be located in the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution at the University of
Lausanne (Switzerland). The Dept. of Ecology and
Evolution in Lausanne is situated on the shores of Lake
Geneva and provides a pleasant & exciting research en-
vironment and a strong PhD program. It is also one of
the largest institutions in Europe for research in ecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology, comprising 17 diﬀerent
research groups. A genomics research centre has also
been recently established at the same site.
The studentship is funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation for a period of 3 years. Starting date should
be as soon as possible. To apply, applicants should
send a CV plus a letter of motivation by EMAIL to

UMainz Lophotrochozoan phylogeny
Dear colleagues, there is an open position (phD) at the
University of Mainz, Institute of Zoology, Germany:
“Phylogeny of molluscs and their relatives based on new
molecular data; Phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa”
In collaboration with other scientists we are intending
to create a stable and well resolved reconstruction of
the Metazoa with special focus on the lophotrochozoan
phylogeny by me and two other collaborates. Our anal-
yses will mainly focus on the Phylum Mollusca and
their relatives, the Sipunculida and the Entoprocta, re-
spectively. To trace this, we will follow up two strate-
gies: (i) we will analyze a huge set of ESTs and ob-
tain an intersection of “new” genes which can be used
to trace the “deep phylogeny” of the Lophotrochozoa
as well as Ecdysozoa and deuterostomes. The second
way (ii) consists of ten “known” proteins common in
all metazoan phyla, which will be analyzed by RT-PCR
and used as a common data set to reconstruct the phy-
logeny of the metazoan classes at the deep Cambrian
level as it is for the ﬁrst approach.
The candidate should have a strong background in
molecular genetics with applicable knowledge in cDNA
technology. Practical experience in RNA-/DNA-
isolation, reverse transcription-PCR and cDNA library
construction. A sound knowledge of sequence analy-
sis or related bio-statistical software is advisable. The
position is available for 2 year.

I am seeking a highly motivated student interested in
pursuing graduate study at a PhD level, starting in
January 2006.
Title: MHC class II haplotypes in the domestic dog
Project: The Major Histocompatibility Complex
(MHC) is a multigene family with a fascinating suite
of evolutionary processes creating a level of diversity
that is among the highest in the genome. Its functional
importance as an integral component of the immune
system has attracted interest among investigators look-
ing for associations with infectious and other immune-
related diseases. This study will construct extended
MHC class II haplotypes in the dog. In addition to un-
derstanding the evolutionary patterns of this important
gene family, haplotypes will be used to aid the search
for causative mutations in an immune-related disease,
type 1 diabetes, in the domestic dog.

UppsalaU AnimalEvolEcol
Postgraduate (PhD) position (“doktorandtj¨ anst”) in
Animal Ecology
The Department of Ecology and Evolution at the Uni-
versity of Uppsala seeks a PhD candidate for the project
“The evolution of ornaments in Sabethes mosquitoes”.
Male-female coevolution of reproductive behavior, mor-
phology and physiology is well documented in many
taxa. Yet, the evolutionary processes responsible for
such concerted evolution is poorly understood in most
cases, and this is particularly true for the evolution
of costly ornaments. In the current project, neotrop-
ical mosquitoes of the genus Sabethes will be used as a
model system. The aquatic larvae of these insects are
inconspicuous but the adults are iridescent and wear
colorful ornaments on their mid-legs. The aim of this
PhD project is to assess sexual selection on, and con-
straints on the evolution of, ornaments in this group
of insects. The candidate will use a variety of diﬀerent
methods, such as manipulative behavioral studies and
artiﬁcial selection experiments on laboratory popula-
tions of these mosquitoes as well as comparative studies
and ﬁeld work.
The successful candidate should have a MSc (or equiv-
alent) in biology/ecology and a strong interest in evo-lutionary biology and behavioral ecology. The can-
didate will join a collaborative research group, cur-
rently consisting of 3 other PhD students, 3 post-
doctoral associates and one senior scientist (G¨ oran
Arnqvist). The latter will function as a supervisor
(see http://www.ebc.uu.se/zooeko/GoranA/GA.html )
and the candidate will receive her/his postgraduate
training within the postgraduate school at the Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre (see http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
index eng.htm ). This position is ﬁnanced by the
Swedish Research Council and is for four full years,
and the successful candidate will receive a postgrad-
uate fellowship the ﬁrst year (14.400 SEK/month)
and a postgraduate position year 2-4 (18.700 - 20.900
SEK/month).
Applications should include (1) personal informa-
tion/background, (2) complete CV (3) a description
of undergraduate training, (4) an authorized copy of
the undergraduate degree and (5) the names and email
addresses of two-three referees. Applications should
be sent to G¨ oran Arnqvist, Dept. of Animal Ecology,

IndianaU DaphniaGenomics
The Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB In-
diana University, Bloomington) carries out research in
genomics, bioinformatics and is a principle laboratory
of the Daphnia Genomics Project. This project cre-
ates genomic resources for a developing model organ-
ism in ecological and evolutionary genomics research.
These resources include a 9-fold sequence coverage of
the genome that was produced by the U.S. Department
of Energys Joint Genome Institute in collaboration with
the Daphnia Genomics Consortium. As a result, Daph-
nia will soon have the best characterized genome among
Crustacea and will ultimately be used to address issues
relating to the genome structure of the arthropods.24 EvolDir November 1, 2005
The CGB has an immediate opening for a Research
Fellow to help create and implement algorithms that
will rigorously test and help improve the assembly of
the genome sequence. The research fellow will also
participate in the exploration and interpretation of the
data. This position is initially funded for one year and
is ideal for investigators who have recently completed
their graduate studies in the ﬁeld of computer science /
bioinformatics, or who are in the ﬁnal stages of complet-
ing their dissertations. However, all candidates with ex-
pertise in computer programming and prior experience
with genome sequencing projects are encouraged to ap-
ply, including visiting scientists. We oﬀer a competitive
salary ($57,000 plus beneﬁts) and access to state of the
art facilities.
Speciﬁcally, this project aims to improve the assembly
of the Daphnia genome by developing two computa-
tional methods for detecting misassembled regions, one
based on pattern statistics and another based on clone
coverage statistics. These independent algorithms are
already proven to accurately detect false assemblies in
microbial genome sequencing projects. These two algo-
rithms will be reﬁned and combined to provide a prob-
abilistic support index for scaﬀold junctions and will
function on much larger and more complex eukaryotic
genomes, including Daphnia. A signiﬁcant outcome is
the creation and implementation of a support index
along localized regions of genome sequence assemblies
to indicate regions of high and low conﬁdence.
Applications will be accepted until October 31,
2005. Interested candidates may contact John Col-
bourne for further information (by sending email to

UNebraska Tech
FIELD and LABORATORY TECHNICIAN – Univer-
sity of Nebraska-Lincoln – for a project examining the
potential ecological eﬀects of the escape of a transgene
for virus resistance from cultivated squash into wild
squash populations.
This project, recently funded by the USDA Biotechnol-
ogy Risk Assessment Program, will involve surveying
wild squash populations for virus infection and the pres-
ence of transgenes derived from transgenic cultivated
squash, experiments to quantify factors controlling the
dynamics of wild squash populations (including the ef-
fect of virus infection), and the development of stochas-
tic demographic models to evaluate the potential eﬀect
of transgenic virus resistance on the dynamics of wild
squash populations.
The technician’s duties will include using PCR and RT-
PCR to detect transgenic resistance to viral infection
and identify virus-infected plants, general lab mainte-
nance, data entry, and database management. During
the ﬁeld season ( ~4 months each year) the technician
will work under the supervision of a graduate student
at a ﬁeld site in Mississippi (housing provided) estab-
lishing ﬁeld experiments and collecting ﬁeld data.
Previous experience using plant molecular techniques is
preferred and a willingness to do ﬁeld work and travel
in the summer required. This would be an excellent
job for a recent college graduate interested in gradu-
ate school in a couple of years. Excellent beneﬁts in-
cluding health insurance and staﬀ/dependent scholar-
ship program. We will begin screening applications on
10/10/2005. To apply send letter of interest, CV, and

Ambiguous Alignments
Hi everybody, I have a question concerning ambigu-
ously alignable regions in aligned nucleotide sequence
data for phylogenetic analyses. Instead of omitting
those sites entirely, I thought it might be a good idea
to keep those taxa, that are unambiguously alignable
within such regions, and only recode the respective nu-
cleotides of those taxa that cannot be aligned unam-
biguously to the other taxa, as missing data. The idea
is to keep as much phylogenetic information as possi-
ble while minimizing the risk of alignment artefacts.
In my case, this concerns primarily outgroup taxa that
cannot be aligned to the ingroup. I am analyzing my
data with model-based approaches of phylogenetic in-
ference (Bayesian, to be speciﬁc). The question now is,
if these additional amounts of missing data (especially
of missing outgroup information) in some regions of the
alignment can have any biasing eﬀects on the outcome
of the analysis. At least in my case, there seems to be
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the topology. The only eﬀect
I observed was a decrease in a few clade support val-
ues. Does anybody have any general recommendations
or theoretical considerations for this problem?

AntiID petition mistake
Dear Colleagues,
Why stoop to the level of the Discovery Institute to sign
a petition that is (1) not entirely accurate (it actually
is fact-based and empirical) and (2) misses the broader
message we should be developing:
That is, ID spreads a lie about evolution, which is why
ID SHOULD be mentioned and discussed in classrooms.This lie is clearly stated in the Discovery Institute pe-
tition: IDists portray evolution by natural selection as
a “random process”. It is not. It is obvious to every
scientist and lay person that life cannot have formed
through a random process. As long as people perceive
evolution as “random”, evolution and evolutionists will
be perceived as biased idiots.
Moreover, ID presents an insidious lie about reli-
gion. IDists promote the assumption that, if evolu-
tion were true, it would directly imply that there is
no God. This is only “true” if God’s only role is
as designer/creator/intervener. Apparently, the pub-
lic needs reminding that this limited view is degrading
and demeaning to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, at
least. Those of us who are part of those communi-
ties need to continually speak out, not only to support
a positive public perception of evolution, but to pre-
serve the power and beauty of the world’s great religious
philosophies. Those great philosophies and traditions
should not be subjugated to a simplistic, materialist,
and ultimately empty search for “evidence” to prove
the existence of some designer.
With regard to signing petitions for or against one the-
ory or another, we scientists should not hold to the
mistaken notion that scientiﬁc truth is based on some
kind of vote or consensus. That the lawyers and theolo-
gians and pols of the Discovery Institute think science
is driven by consensus belies their very great misunder-
standing of the scientiﬁc process. We do not need to
follow their lead on this at all.
Finally, it simply counter-productive to disallow dis-
cussion of ideas in our classrooms, particularly the mis-
guided ones! Instead, we need to train our students how
to distinguish testable hypotheses from non-testable
ones, like ID. We need to train our students how to dis-
criminate between testable hypotheses, like Lamarckian
evolution, some forms of special creation, and descent
with modiﬁcation. Just because we know the world is
a sphere, that there is global warming, and that we
breathe oxygen doen’t mean we should fail to teach
our students HOW we know these things–i.e., HOW
we know the other ideas are wrong. Without that dis-
cussion, students and the public will continue to re-
gard the scientiﬁc community as elitist, anti-religion,
and narrow-minded.
I propose an alternative: Let’s demand that ID be al-
lowed for discussion in public schools, with the proviso
that discussion include the following: (1) evolution by
natural selection is a very non-random process, and (2)
even if evolution were true (or false), that is no test for
or against the existence of God.
(I suppose another alternative might be to sue the Dis-November 1, 2005 EvolDir 51
covery Institute in court because it is slandering evolu-
tion and evolutionists...but we already have problems
ﬁnding funding for evolution!)

Arlequin responses
Here is a list of all the responses I got in regards to my
question about Arlequin. Thanks for all your help!
Arlequin will implicitly recognize that you have shared
alleles if you tell him to infer haplotype from distance
matrix in the “Polymorphism control” tab. THere
is now a discussion Forum for Arlequin on http://-
www.rannala.org/phpBB2/ Laurent Excoﬃer
If you are simply listing the haplotypes after you have
entered them into Arlequin, I think it will only list them
as you entered them. However, when you perform anal-
yses (e.g., AMOVA), then Arlequin will automatically
search for haplotypes shared among populations. Mike
Taylor
I had the same problem that with the new version it
did not recognise the shared haplotypes whereas the old
version did. But I did not suceed in solve the problem.
Sabine Wornick
Combine all your populations into a single large popu-
lation and you will get the information you want. Jan
McDowell
Try to write unic name for each haplotype. When Ar-
lequin run will give you a lot of WARNING!, but you
must forget it. In the text you will see what haplotype
shares with each other from the diﬀerent populations.

“NON,AMY L” <anon@uﬂ.edu >Bead DNA extraction
I am interested in advice regarding magnetic bead
based extraction methods, kits, etc. I recall that there
had been a post recently (last 6 months?), but cannot
ﬁnd it in the archives. If anyone saved the posts, would
you please forward them to me?
If not, i am interested in pursuing the magnetic bead
system, and would greatly appreciate any suggestions
for non-robotic microtube or 96well-format, especially
as regards costs, simplicity and downstream applica-
tions (ie. sequencing product cleanup). Furthermore,
do you have a protocol for reusing the beads, or making
your own extraction buﬀers?
many thanks, ~amy

Bead extraction answers
Many thanks to everyone who responded; the general
sense seems to be that it works best if you spend a lit-
tle more, but sometimes a stripped-down kitchen sink
approach is good too... ahh, science!
cheers, ~amy
******** We recently published an article that included
a comparison of 96-well DNA extraction protocols. In
it, we tested one commercially available magnetic bead
based kit (Invitrogen’s CST kit) against four others. In
short, we found the CST kit to be quick, easy, moder-
ately expensive, eﬀective for extracting from fresh ver-
tebrate tissue, not eﬀective for extracting from fresh or
archival moth tissue, and sensitive to contamination.
The reference is below.

ingham, S., Dooh, R., Kirk, S.L., Mackie, P.M., and

ume assembly of DNA barcodes. Philosophical Trans-
actions: Biological Sciences 362:1959-1967.52 EvolDir November 1, 2005
******** I have no experience myself on this topic, but
if I remember well what other people were used to do
where I was before, magnetic beads ARE re-useable.
******** I worked closely with invitrogen & eppendorf
to develop a beads-based robotic protocol for plant ge-
nomic DNA isolation (attached). The comparisons of
invitrogen vers promega beads demonstrated that DNA
yield from invitrogen beads is ~5times higher.
******** We are using Magnesil Blue from Promega
with robot and non-robot protocols. Instead of the sug-
gested buﬀers, we are perfoming two ethanol washing
steps and elude the DNA simply with ddH2O. It works
well for further fragment as well as sequencing analyses.
******** A year ago my lab tried Qiagen’s MagAttract-
96 kit for various plant tissue (needles, leaves, megaga-
metophytes) with no success. A small percentage of
the species produced hi yields, but most yielded DNA
in concentrations less than 5 ng/uL. I tested this pro-
cedure both on the benchtop and on a robot, but found
that the system was suseptible to “gumming up,” even
when extremely small amounts of tissue was used. We
retured to the column-plate kits since the increase in
cost per sample is oﬀset by knowning we will get good
DNA every time. Qiagen maintains that other labs use
the MagAttract kit on plant material to great success,
though.
******* (the relevant previous post) Have you thought
about magnetic beads extractions? They are designed
for automated use but can also be used for manual ex-
tractions. You just need a magnetic plate (AGOVA
box). See at Quiagen or Promega. Product name
at Promega is Magnesil. There are diﬀerent types of
beads, depending what kind of DNA. We perform ex-
tractions with a much simpler protocol than provided
by the producer, just using Magnesil Blue, ethanol and
distilled water. No extra solutions included in the kit
are really necessary. We use this protocol on various
animal, although it is originally designed for plant tis-
sue or plasmids. Like this we could lower the costs very
much.

masmith@nature.berkeley.eduCAIC vs Nexus
Dear Evoldir members, I have some problems with phy-
logeny translation: I would like to run Compare with
6112 bird taxa, and Compare only accepts Nexus ﬁles.
I’ve written my phylogenetic codes in a CAIC fashion,
as I’m used to (and it’s so easy...), and tried to run
TreeEdit to convert these codes into Nexus codes. But
it doesn’t work, I suppose it’s because there are too
many taxa. In the worst case scenario, I thought about
cutting my CAIC codes, translating the several ﬁles in
Nexus, but how can I paste them together then? Other-
wise, is there a program that could for example trans-
late CAIC codes into Newick codes and then Newick
codes into Nexus codes? Please, does anybody have
any idea? Many thanks for any help or advice. All the
best,

Announcement: 18 October 2005
FORMATION OF THE CANADIAN SOCIETY FOR
ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
Canada is a world leader in ecological and evolution-
ary research, with the highest ranking per grant dol-
lar in terms of number of publications and citations
(Peters et al. 1996 Can J Fish Aquat Sci 53, 670).
This research contributes to the social and economic
wellbeing of Canadians in many ways. For example, it
has given us better predictions of the consequences of
global climate change, revealed the scope of ecosystem
change within the Arctic, monitored the spread of in-
vasive species, improved control measures for diseases,
and furthered our understanding of the basic mecha-
nisms by which biodiversity evolves and is maintained.
Nevertheless, there is a need for us to come together as
a group to communicate our ﬁndings to the public and
to participate in the development of government poli-
cies relevant to our ﬁelds. Furthermore, we need a voice
to advocate our need for research funding. Ecology and
evolution is one of the fastest growing disciplines sup-
ported by NSERC (GSC18), yet it received the largest
cut in the last reallocations process. A small planning
group mandated by the GSC18 panel to review the situ-
ation and suggest possible remedies met 7-8 September
at NSERC headquarters in Ottawa. With the encour-
agement of NSERC, we have founded a national soci-
ety for ecology and evolution, provisionally titled The
Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution, and have
drafted a constitution ( www.ecoevo.ca ).
The purposes of the society shall be (1) to promote
the study of ecology and evolution in Canada, (2) to
raise public awareness of the importance of ecology and
evolution to Canadian society, (3) to facilitate commu-
nication between members of the Society and decision-
makers in the public, private and non-governmental sec-
tors, and (4) to act as a liaison with Federal and Provin-cial funding agencies to support and promote ecological
and evolutionary research in Canada.
The inaugural meeting of the society will be held in
Montreal in April 2006, when a constitution will be ap-
proved and oﬃcers elected (information and registra-
tion will be available at www.ecoevo.ca ). In the mean-
time, the business of the society will be conducted by
a temporary council comprising Graham Bell (McGill,
acting President), Douglas Morris (Lakehead, acting
Vice-President), Sally Otto (UBC, acting Secretary),
Louis Bernatchez (Laval, acting Treasurer) and coun-
cil members Douglas Haﬀner (Windsor), Jeﬀ Hutch-
ings (Dalhousie), Kathy Martin (UBC), Denis R´ eale
(UQAM) and Locke Rowe (Toronto).
To achieve our goals, we need your membership. We
believe that the society is vital to ensure the future of
our discipline in Canada, and we aim for the broad-
est possible membership. If you support our objec-
tives, we urge you to become a member and to circulate
this announcement among your students and person-
nel. The application form can be found on our web-
site ( www.ecoevo.ca ). Membership dues will be used
to cover the costs of establishing the society, running
meetings, supporting targeted workshops, and publish-
ing policy statements and other documents to improve
the communication of our work. Please join us and
improve the voice of ecology

Clonal Structure Statistics
Hello,
I am a graduate student at Iowa State University and
am working with multiﬂora rose, an invasive plant that
reproduces clonally and by seeds. I used genetic mark-
ers (allozymes) to analyze clonal structure within small
and large patches of this plants an am now trying to
calculate the power of my data to distinguish clones.
In particular, I was interested in calculating for each
patch the average probability that ramets with identi-
cal allozyme patterns belong to the same genet (as in
Aspinwall & Christian 1992 Am. J. Bot. 294-299)
Does anyone know of a computer program that calcu-54 EvolDir November 1, 2005
lates this statistic and other measures related to the
analysis of clonal structure?

Echinoderm samples
Dear Mr or Mrs, I’m just beginning my PhD at the
oceanologic center of Marseille, at the diversity, evo-
lution and functional marine ecology laboratory (DI-
MAR). My work deals with the irregular urchins and
more particularly with the heart urchin Echinocardium
cordatum for which we are studying phylogeography
and population genetics. So, I’m looking for specimens
of diﬀerent populations of the world, and I’m wonder-
ing if you could send me some in order to integrate
them in my study. About 30 specimens by location
would be ideal for population genetics, but just a few
are enough for a phylogeography study. As I work on
DNA, the specimens must have been conserved in alco-
hol or frozen. I would be very obliged if you could help
me or if you know somebody that could help me, and
I’m open to new collaborations. I’m very inpatient to
read your replay, thank you for your help.

Evol bibliography56 EvolDir November 1, 2005
A few years ago I introduced a big downloadable bib-
liography of about 10,000 references on evolutionary
biology, ecological genetics and population genetics. It
has accumulated over many years as an aid to research,
and to help a book on frequency-dependent selection for
the Oxford University Press. It struck me that others
might ﬁnd the bibliography useful.
I have now updated it (to about 12,000 references). The
bibliography is potentially valuable to others because it
includes many references to papers written before com-
puter searches became established. The ﬁles have the
advantage over the Web of Science (or Google Scholar)
in that they go back before the 1980s, they are much
faster to obtain, and they have already been winnowed
for their evolutionary interest. Many of the recent ref-
erences have abstracts attached.
Please note that the bibliography contains errors and
duplications, and oﬀers no guarantees of accuracy. You
should always check any reference against the original
publication before quoting it.

Evolution Artwork UMichigan
A&DLife in conjunction with the University of Michi-
gan School of Art & Design would like to announce a
call for submissions to its upcoming exhibition of con-
temporary art, ENDLESS FORMS: ENGAGING EVO-
LUTION. ? www.endlessforms.net Now more than
ever, the concepts, practices, and inﬂuences of evolu-
tionary biology spotlight the asetheticised experiences
of contemporary life and culture.? The aim of this show
is to explore the diversity of forms that communicate,
comment on, and engage the science of evolutionary
biology and mechanisms of evolutionary change.??
A&DLife presents this exhibition during the Exploring
Evolution theme semester at the University of Michi-
gan. ?From February 24th to March 24th, 2006, theWORK exhibition space in bustling Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan will be transformed to engage evolution and its
endless forms.
The theme of the show will revolve around the ﬁve com-
monly observed forces or mechanisms of organic bio-
logical evolution. ?? Works should focus on one or
more of the following: NATURAL SELECTION The
processes of nature by which the presence of heritable
genetic variation in traits leads to diﬀerential reproduc-
tion. ?Advantageous traits that inﬂuence survival and
reproduction are transferred from the parents to the
oﬀspring and result in a disproportionate representa-
tion of traits in the next generation. ?But don’t forget
the environment!? What’s good today may be gone
tomorrow!?
SEXUAL SELECTION Because traits involved in sex-
ual displays for attracting mates are often visually com-
pelling, no exploration of contemporary art and evo-
lutionary biology would be complete without includ-
ing mechanisms of sexual selection.?Sexual selection is
driven by competition for mates and is often character-
ized by its elaborate displays.
MUTATION Changes in the DNA sequence within a
gene or chromosome of an organism possibly resulting
in the creation of a new trait not found in the parental
type.
MIGRATION The act or an instance of migrating that
leads to changes in the gene frequencies within popula-
tions (Also referred to as gene ﬂow).
GENETIC DRIFT Random ﬂuctuations in the fre-
quency of a gene in a small population, presumably
owing to chance rather than natural selection and of-
ten results in a reduction of genetic variation.
We seek works that build upon the conﬂuence of con-
temporary art and design along with biological evolu-
tion as object and/or as process. We have a particular
interest in works that examine the history and philos-
ophy of evolutionary biology, competing ideas or hy-
potheses that have contributed to our current under-
standing of evolution, the role of sex and recombina-
tion in shaping genetic diversity, and the burgeoning
emphasis we place on organismal development in our
conceptions of genetic evolution.
All submissions should be in the form of a url where
images of works and media are displayed. ?
Submissions should include 2-3 images for each work
or a link to online video if time-based work is to be
considered. The category or categories that the work
falls into should be speciﬁed along with its dimensions,
and medium(s). Each entry should also include contactNovember 1, 2005 EvolDir 57
information for the artist.
Consideration for inclusion in this special exhibition,
associated venues, its companion web exhibition, and
accompanying catalogue will be given to all work sub-
mitted before the deadlines. Shipping arrangements
will be made by contacting the artists upon acceptance.
Open call submissions due: November 21th, 2005.

Extraction kits answers
Here are the comments I got on cheap and easy to use
extraction kits (for automated use!): hope that it would
be helpful for someone else tooMartin
ich empfehle einen Blick auf das EZNA Tissue Kit von
Peqlab ( www.peqlab.de ). Ich habe damit sehr gute Er-
fahrungen gemacht. Es ist insbesondere viel g¨ unstiger
als Qiagen und Macherey-Nagel Kits.
Have you thought about magnetic beads extractions?
They are designed for automated use but can also be
used for manual extractions. You just need a mag-
netic plate (AGOVA box). See at Quiagen or Promega.
Product name at Promega is Magnesil. There are dif-
ferent types of beads, depending what kind of DNA. We
perform extractions with a much simpler protocol than
provided by the producer, just using Magnesil Blue,
ethanol and distilled water. No extra solutions included
in the kit are really necessary. We use this protocol on
various animal, although it is originally designed for
plant tissue or plasmids. Like this we could lower the
costs very much.

“ We are hoping to run some minisatellites but do not
have radioactivity facilities. I would be grateful if any-
one could advise on any alternative methods of visualis-
ing minisatellites that are available, and where I might
ﬁnd details of the protocols for these.”

2005/09/13 08:53 AM How about using DIG labelling
from Roche. We used this successfully for RFLP map-
ping although it is quite long winded. We often size
PCR fragments up to 2kb with our capillary sequencer
although unfortunately this will be no help to you. I
suppose you maybe able to tweek the protocols and use
a non denaturing system used for SSCP but unfortu-
nately I have never tried this.
“santos alonso” <santos.alonso@ehu.es >Regarding
your question, I remember that Cellmark Diagnostics
use to sell non-radioactive probes, for using in combi-
nation with CPD (I think that was the name of the
substrate. This was both for ﬁngerprinting (Jeﬀreys
33.15 and 33.6) and single locus probes. The probes
were attached to an alkaline phosphatase. But this was58 EvolDir November 1, 2005
some years ago, may be they have something new now,
with ﬂuorochromes or so, but I doubt that if the min-
isatellite bands are big you will be able to size them in
an ABI machine (or the like). If you cannot purchase
probes with an attached alkaline phosphatase, you can
label them yourself or have them made for you (ask any
of the companies that synthesize oligos).
“Tim Sharbel” <sharbel@ipk-gatersleben.de >We do
lots of AFLPs and microsatellites with PAGE in my

the gels with very good success. The following web

staining: http://www.msu.edu/user/hazensam/aﬂp/-

“Becher, Anette” <anette.becher@agresearch.co.nz >
You could alwys try digoxygenin labelling. It is
probably now considered an older techinque, but has
been used successfully with minisatellites. I have
done quite a lot of dig labelling in plants in the
past, basically whenever I needed to visualise DNA
immobilised on a membrane (colony lifts, scoring
RFLPs etc). We just followed the manufacturer’s
protocol at the time (Boehringer Mannheim, I think
- seems to be patented by Roche now : http://-
www.roche-applied-science.com/prodinfo fst.htm?/-
DIG/dig why.htm ), but there is probably lots on
the web. I found this protocol here, which rings
a bell, but is a lot shorter (due to fewer washes)
than what I used to do. http://www.cimmyt.org/-
ABC/Protocols/CheckingActivity.PDF There is
some literature on comparison of non-radiactive
labelling techniques at the NCBI, here are a
couple that a quick query pulled out: http:/-

tuids514067&dopt /lessmuchstract I found the DIG tech-
nique easy to use with basic equipment, it was a lot
more sensitive than radiolabelling, but it was slower
because of the umpteen washes (but this seems to have
improved if above protocol is representative).

Genepop ver. 3.4, Fstat ver. 2.9.3.2, and Spagedi

that Genepop is doing a diﬀerent randomization test,
but I’m not clear what the randomization procedure is.
Can anyone explain and advise on which test is better?

Host for SEEC2006
Greetings Everyone,
We are still looking for a host for the 2006 Southeastern
Ecology and Evolution Conference (SEEC). The past
two years have been a great success ( www.uga.edu/-
seec) but we need a student and a school to run it
for next year. We would still be shooting for an
March/April time-frame but the date is ultimately up
to the host. The host would not be starting from
scratch as we have some money and materials available
to ensure that the next SEEC will be a success.
Please contact Tom Luhring at luhring@srel.edu for fur-
ther information.
Thanks again for all of your support and participation
over the last couple of years.
Sincerely,

Human genetic databases

formation on global human genetic diversity in both
neutral genetic markers such as microsatellites and in
classical genetic markers such as blood group polymor-
phisms.

This invitation to sign a petition expressing support for
the teaching of evolution in public schools and against
the inclusion of Intelligent Design just came over the
campus Evolution Group email list. For those of you
who missed Ed Larson’s talk on the teaching evolution
controversy last Friday (at the University of Wiscon-
sin), the Discovery Institute is a pro-ID think-tank that
pimps ID around by saying that “400 scientists support
it - so there!” Larson pointed out that there are over
1 million scientists in the United States, and the Dis-
cover Institute could only ﬁnd *400* willing to say they
support ID (and it took them 4 years to ﬁnd them).
Furthermore, fewer than 70 of those 400 are biologists.

Megabace Question
Evoldir Folk-
I would greatly appreciate informed opinions about the
MegaBace sequencing platform. Due to the purchase
of MJ Research by Bio-Rad and associated fallout, we
are retiring out MJR BaseStation. We now have access
to an ABI machine that is used nearly non-stop for mi-
crosatellite genotyping. Without the cash on hand to
purchase a more high-throughput ABI sequencing plat-
form, I’ve been considering buying a used MegaBace
with the idea of devoting it entirely to sequencing for
SAGE. 96 capillary machines can be bought for about
$20K, and I’ve been told that these machines provide
high quality sequence data. On the other hand, com-
mercial sequencing labs are getting cheaper all the time.
I’ve seen ads for $2.50/sample.
So.. If you have a MegaBace, I’d like to know whether
you like it or not (and why) and whether or not, despite
the low purchase price for a used machine, the consum-
ables and time required to run one of these machines,
and reliability would make this cost-eﬀective relative
to outsourcing the sequencing for our upcoming SAGE
work.
Please reply directly oﬀ-list as I am sure the whole
group is not interested in this issue.

http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/ ˜ csmith/-
ChrisSmith.htm Here are the answers:
Under ideal conditions, the general eﬀect of overspec-
iﬁcation should be reduction of statistical power (ﬂat-
tening of the likelihood surface), while underspeciﬁca-
tion can indeed lead to odd artifacts (being misled).
Also, the cost of overspeciﬁcation in a Bayesian context
should be less than in an ML context because nuisance
parameters (for which the data may be only weakly in-
formative) are integrated out. You might look at the
Lemmon and Moriarty paper in Sys Bio a few years
ago, which speciﬁcally investigates the practical conse-
quences of model over and underspeciﬁcation on simu-
lated data, in a Bayesian context.
Hope that helps, D Derrick Zwickl

Hi Chris,
Is there a way to combine information from multiple
genes with diﬀerent mutation rates in R8’s?
As far as I know this cannot be done with r8s right now.
But this can be done with MULTIDIVTIME
Similarly, I am interested in the eﬀect of model pa-
rameters on the behavior of MULTIDIVTIME. The re-
lease notes suggest that the most complicated model
that can be implemented is F84+gamma. Does anyone
have experience using this program for data sets whereNovember 1, 2005 EvolDir 61
more complicated models - say, GTR+I+G for example
- are justiﬁed? What are the consequences of using the
simpler model if the data depart signiﬁcantly from the
expectations of F84+gamma?
I would guess that there is not too much of a prob-
lem with this kind of model misspeciﬁcation. However,
how much of a problem it creates will be related to how
divergent your sequences are, with larger divergences
(corrected distances of 0.5-1+) being most drastically
aﬀected. In my opinion, the most important thing is
to have a rates across sites process, like gamma, in the
model. Even if I+G ﬁts better than G alone, I don’t
think this will matter too much because the invariable
sites end up getting accounted for in the lowest rate
category for the gamma.
Keep in mind I’ve never done the test myself. I
would suggest testing things out by simulating data
under GTR+I+G using Seq-Gen and see how well
ESTBRANCHES/MULTIDIVTIME does at recovering
branchlengths etc using the F84+g model. This is prob-
ably the only decent way to really get an idea of how
bad things could be.
Finally, I strongly suggest you do not use the additive
penalty for r8s. We have good evidence that it causes
serious biases in divergence times.
Sincerely Andrew J. Roger Associate Professor Dept.
of Biochem/Mol. Biol. Dalhousie University Halifax,
N.S. Canada
Dear Chris,
Sorry, I haven’t got an answer to your question, al-
though I am familiar with MULTIDIVTIME. I’d also
be very interested in ﬁnding out whether there is a way
to specify a more complex model than F84+gamma.
When too simple a model is speciﬁed, Bayesian anal-
yses (e.g. MrBayes) tend to come up with spurious
results, whereas overspeciﬁcation is usually not a prob-
lem. So that isn’t likely to be any diﬀerent in MUL-
TIDIVTIME. Based on a recent paper in Systematic
Biology (particularly at the ﬁgures on pages 909 and
910 -model underspeciﬁcation vs. overspeciﬁcation).
According to this, MULTIDIVTIME should ideally in-
clude the GTR+I+G model, just to be on the safe side.
I’d very much appreciate if you could keep me updated
if anyone can suggest away how to do this.
Best wishes, Peter “Dr. Peter R. Teske”

hello Chris, I’ve used multidivtime and it easily does
multiple genes, diﬀerent position partitions. Go ahead
and send Thorne an email, he responds very quickly
and thoughtfully. Curious to see what you hear back,Chris Christopher West Wheat <cww10@psu.edu >
Well, Multidivtime is a bugger to run, but once you’ve
done it once or a couple of times it is more-or-less
straightforward. When we ran both Multidivtime and

Moller case
Dear Colleagues,
Below are links to recent developments in the case
against Anders Moller. The ﬁrst link is a recent essay
by Moller concerning his view of the ordeal. The sec-
ond is a link to the French CNRS (Moller’s employer)
report conducted by an independent board of inquiry
that clears Moller. In essence, the conclusion of the
impartial committee was that there was no evidence to
support accusations of intellectual dishonesty.

Moller criticism follow-up
In response to Mousseau and Moller, and perhaps oth-62 EvolDir November 1, 2005
ers who might think that Moller’s reply and unpub-
lished MS provide a satisfactory explanation, I repeat
my question regarding Moller’s published data. It has
yet to be answered, so I hope the question is clearer
this time.
Why, are symmetrical (or nearly symmetrical) individu-
als ABSENT among shorter-tailed male barn swallows
(<100mm tail length; shaded areas in the graphs) in
two early studies by Moller (1990, 1992), yet PRESENT
in two subsequent graphs in a later paper by Moller
(1999) for the same population? For actual graphs,
see:
http://www2.biology.ualberta.ca/palmer/pubs/-
05MollerComm/MollerDataIrreg.pdf In the former
two studies, the absence of symmetrical (or nearly sym-
metrical) individuals among shorter-tailed individuals
yielded graphs showing a tidy decrease of asymmetry
with increasing tail size, which was a ’predicted’ out-
come in both papers. In the latter paper, symmetrical
(or nearly symmetrical) individuals were expected to
be most common at all tail lengths (not just longer
ones) and were found to be so, in sharp contrast to the
earlier studies.
This crucial point is not addressed in Moller’s reply to
Mousseau, nor Moller’s unpublished MS submitted to
Evolution:
http://cricket.biol.sc.edu/dedication/moller/moller-
FA-year.pdf both of which deal with change in average
FA , and overall size-dependence of FA, over time, not
with the apparently ’missing’ symmetrical individuals
at small tail lengths in the 1990 and 1992 studies.
One possible resolution to this debate would be for
Moller to post publicly (for example, on Mousseau’s
web site) his raw data on the lengths of the right and
left outer tail feathers of male barn swallows from his
well-studied Kraghede population, for each year, for the
years 1988 - 2004. Perhaps the patterns exhibited in
the 1988 and 1990 sampling years were simply ﬂukes.
This possibility cannot be judged merely by examining
summary statistics like those in Moller’s unpublished
MS.
As for public discussion, a public clariﬁcation will go
further towards putting the community’s concerns to
rest than private re-assurances.
Regards, Rich Palmer
PS. To my chagrin, when double checking Moller’s orig-
inal 1992 paper, I discovered a graphing error in the ﬁg-
ure I posted earlier (two extraneous points in panel 1b
– the uppermost two). I have now corrected the posted
ﬁle. If anything, the discrepancy between the early andlater Moller data sets is now even stronger. I apologize
for this careless oversight. –

Moller data
Further to the recent developments in the case regard-
ing data fabrication by A.P. Moller posted to this list
by Tim Mousseau, I oﬀer the following. A commen-
tary I prepared on another – more compelling – exam-
ple of questionable data published by A.P. Moller was
rejected editorially (without review) by Nature (Mar.
24, 2004), TREE (May 12, 2004) and Evolution (Oct.
24, 2004). It was also submitted (Mar. 30, 2004) to
the CNRS committee that evaluated Moller’s ’convic-
tion’ by the Danish Committee on Scientiﬁc Dishonesty,
but the CNRS committee ignored it and chose to focus
solely on the data at issue in the now infamous and
withdrawn Oikos paper. A careful reading of the de-
cision by the CNRS “committee of wise men” reveals
that no clear conclusion was possible – either guilty or
innocent – regarding scientiﬁc misconduct in the Oikos
incident: “Lacking the material evidence necessary to
establish innocence, the committee was equally unable
to reach this conclusion . . . [so] the presumption
of innocence must be applied”. As peer-reviewed jour-
nals and CNRS seem unwilling to consider additional
evidence regarding suspicious irregularities in data pub-
lished by A.P. Moller, I make these data publicly avail-
able. In a nutshell, scatterplots of data from two early
papers by Moller, reporting an association between size
and asymmetry in barn swallow outer tail feathers, ap-
pear strongly inconsistent with similar data from a later
paper that wished to draw a diﬀerent conclusion. A
plausible explanation for the patterns exhibited in these
scatterplots would be welcome.

Dear Massimo and others,
In response to Massimo Pigliucci’s letter: Do you re-
ally mean what you say? Should we settle an impor-
tant scientiﬁc dispute in court? The case is not just
about M’s personal conduct. It is also about the va-
lidity of many scientiﬁc claims and results. Palmer’s
criticism concerns published scientiﬁc results, many of
which have had considerable impact on the ﬁeld. It is
more than a little embarrassing that leading scientiﬁc
journals are so unwilling to publish serious criticisms
of published research. Those of us who care about sci-
entiﬁc truth certainly would like to know whether and
what we should believe from M’s papers, and this is true
regardless of whether the problems are due to fraud or
to more or less innocent carelessness. I think Palmer
deserves our respect for being willing to put his crit-
icisms forward. As for M, the best he could do for
both science and for his reputation would be to pro-
vide a serious to-the-point explanation that addresses
the essence of Palmer’s criticism.
Real men may prefer settling disputes in courtyards,
but real scientists prefer to settle them in open debate.64 EvolDir November 1, 2005

Moller more
Dear Colleagues,
For those of you who are not interested in this PUB-
LIC discussion, I apologize for continuing it longer. I
can assure you that I have no interest in perpetuating
this debate, or mediating it in any way. However, in
the face of ongoing and unjustiﬁed PUBLIC criticisms
of my colleague, Anders Moller, whose behavior I have
found to be above reproach and certainly not worthy of
unsubstantiated attacks, I oﬀer the following response
to Rich Palmer’s recent posting:
Rich has insinuated that changes in tail length FA dis-
tributions among three Moller papers (Moller 1990,
1992, 1999) reﬂects selective use of data (or worse).

As far as I know, Rich has not asked Moller directly
for clariﬁcation concerning possible biological explana-
tions. Thus, for my own beneﬁt, and that of this group,
I have asked Moller myself. His response:
+
Dear Tim,
I have recorded asymmetry in barn swallows annually
since the 1980’s. Concomitant with a dramatic increase
in tail length in males (Moller & Sz´ ep 2005) there has
been a dramatic decrease in mean and variance in asym-
metry. Furthermore, the relationship between unsigned
asymmetry and character size has changed from signif-
icantly negative to completely ﬂat, with this temporal
eﬀect being present in males, but not in females. All
this information is contained in a manuscript that was
submitted to Evolution, but rejected because it was not
“novel”. I would be happy to share this manuscript
with Palmer or anybody else. Perhaps Palmer’s emo-
tional attitude prevented him from looking for a biolog-
ical explanation and from contacting a colleague before
making public accusations.
All the best,Anders

Multidivtime calibration point
Dear Evoldir members,
Does anybody know if the node used as calibration
point in the relaxed molecular clock program Multi-
divtime needs to be within the main phylogeny we’re
interested in? We have no clade that could be used for
calibration in our crustacean COI phylogeny, only one
from a diﬀerent crustacean family. The program runs
ﬁne as long as the outgroup speciﬁed is basal (e.g. from
a diﬀerent Order), but how reliable are the results from
such an analysis likely to be? Or is there an alternative
method?

PCR cleanup
Colleagues:
Because of problems with competitive uptake of salts,
unincorporated primers and dNTPs during capillary
electrophoresis, we are looking for a high-throughput
method to remove these from PCR reactions prior to
analysis on a CEQ8000. Most kits remove salts and
DNA<100 base pairs, but we have informative frag-
ments between 60 and 100 bp so we need a method
that will retain DNA >60 bp but remove both salts
and DNA <60 bp. Does anyone know of a method or
kit that will do this?

Phylogenetic congruence
Hello all,
I am just looking for a software other than Paup im-
plementing ILD test (also known as “partition homo-
geneity test for phylogenetic congruence). The aim is

advice are welcome!

Phylogenetic congruence answers
Cher St´ ephane,
Une question similaire a d´ ej` a ´ et´ e pos´ ee sur Evoldir il y
a quelques mois. Voici les r´ eponses:
Dear all,
A few days ago, I posted the following query:
“I often use the Partition Homogeneity Test (= ILD) in
PAUP* to test data homogeneity for pylogenetic anal-
yses, but as the number of taxa increases, this rapidly
becomes impossible to use. This is related to the use
of parsimony in this test, even if the principle of PHT
should allow the use of other (and faster to compute)
optimality criteria. Unfortunately, PAUP requires the
use of parsimony in PHT. Is anyone aware of another
(good) method to test data homogeneity, with an asso-
ciate software or PAUP routine?”
Many people seem to have the same problem. Here arethe putative solutions I received:
- See attachment [Zelwer M and Daubin V; 2004. De-
tecting phylogenetic incongruence using BioNJ: an im-
provement of the ILD test. Mol Phyl Evol 33: 687-693].
Rob Cruickshank
- The test was made for and justiﬁed based on the par-
simony criterion, of course. To make it tractable for
a large dataset, you can use an abbreviated heuristic
search to speed up the analysis of the random partitions
if necessary (i.e., limit the number of trees swapped
using nchuck command, for instance, or use a smaller
number of repetitions using the nrep=5 command, or
even using the parsimony ratchet, though implementing
that might be a chore). This app[roach risks not ﬁnd-
ing the very best tree for each random replicate, which
would have the eﬀect of increasing the variance of your
p-value from its “true” value that you would ﬁnd using
exact searches. However, this approach shouldn’t intro-
duce a strong bias that would drive the p-value strongly
up or down, because the failure to ﬁnd the best tree
would be equally likely to aﬀect the partitioned and un-
partitioned length estimates for each replicate, giving
the ILD for each replicate a more-or-less equal chance
of increasing or decreasing.
You should not use an abbreviated search for your test
partition, however, since the accuracy of this length
diﬀerence is critical. You want this estimate to be as
precise as possible.
As for switching to other criteria, the ILD concept could
be adapted to likelihood, but this would be much more
time consuming, so it wouldn’t help you. Huelsen-
beck and Bull have their likelihood-based nonparamet-
ric bootstrap for incongruence, but it is far more com-
putationally intensive than the parsimony ILD. I don’t
know of a clear justiﬁcation for using an ILD-like test
in a distance context, and I would be very wary of such
an approach. The ILD measures conﬂict between and
within data subsets, which has a direct relationship to
length diﬀerence. I don’t know if we can assume that
diﬀerences in total branch lengths (for minimum evolu-
tion criterion) or least-squares-ﬁt or other such distance
measures should be distributed in a similar way under
the null hypothesis of no incongruence, which is what
is required for the ILD test to be valid.
Joe Thornton
- Did you try Winclada + Nona ( http://-
www.cladistics.com/ )? These programs are faster
than PAUP.
Sophie Qu´ erouil
[My translation]November 1, 2005 EvolDir 67
- 1. I don’t know of a faster optimality criterion than
parsimony. If you’re thinking of neighbor-joining, that
method doesn’t have an optimality criterion, and there-
fore the test can’t be performed on it. I suppose you
could construct a neighbor-joining tree and then eval-
uate the topology under some optimality criterion, ei-
ther least squares or parsimony. Parsimony would still
be the fastest to compute.
2. Are you aware of recent literature showing that the
ILD isn’t a reliable test? In particular, I’m thinking
of Barker, F. K., and F. M. Lutzoni. 2002. Spurious
rejection of phylogenetic congruence by the ILD test:
A simulation study. Syst. Biol. 51:625-637. But there
are other similar papers.

- The attached paper by Waddell, Kishino and Ota
[2000. Rapid Evaluation of the Phylogenetic Congru-
ence of Sequence Data Using Likelihood Ratio Tests.
Mol Biol Evol 17(12): 1988-1992] describes a homo-
geneity test that can use RELL. RELL is, in this sort
of application, very fast. The required parts are avail-
able in PAUP (the site likelihoods or probabilities of
data patterns) but an R script would be best to put it
all together.

Removing PCR inhibition
Dear Colleagues
I am currently trying to isolate DNA from parasite eggs
in feces and am having considerable diﬃculty in getting
good DNA and good PCR products. The parasites in
question are Eimeria, Nematodes and Cestodes found
in birds that eat both plant matter and insects. I can
get weak signals after PCR when the sample contains
thousands of Oocysts, for example, but the results are
not consistent.
I was wondering if anyone had managed to do this in
birds that have low parasite numbers, or if anyone had
tips on additions to the PCR, or steps in the extraction
procedure, that may nullify eﬀects of inhibitors present
in feces, insect digests, or plant digests. I currently us a
standard Phenol chloroform extraction, with a glycogen
carrier to aid DNA precipitation. I use a CTAB stage
in the extractions, which seems to improve the yield of
DNA. I have also tried using several spin columns, but
the recovery of DNA from this method is low. I have
the appropriate positive control DNA which works well
at the PCR stage.
Thanks

Dear all,
Ive to apologise for my delay. Thanks to the helpful
comments regarding the recovery of SSCP bands. What
seemed to work best for me is to simply excise the band
andlet it soak for a couple of hours in some 20 µl of wa-
ter.
–Basti
Here are the answers I got:
I put the excised bands directly into 60ul
1xTBE,incubated at 70c for two hours, then left
in the fridge overnight. I was subsequently able to
successfully reamplify 25 of 26 bands. I’ve not done
any sequencing to assess the quality of what I’ve
reampliﬁed as I’ve literally just run the PCR out on
agarose, but this method appears to be working well
so far as I can tell.
I simply excise the bands from the gel with a wide-bore
(tips cut down) 200 ul pipette tip. I suspend the gel
plug in 50-100 ul of H2O overnight. I use the this wa-
ter directly for re-ampliﬁcation. A little BSA in the re-
ampliﬁcation reaction might help. The only problem
I have enountered is cross-contamination from other
SSCP bands, in this case you have to end up cloning
the PCR products.
We have success with most templates cutting dsDNA
or ssDNA bands from dried non-denaturing and dena-
turing acrylamide gels and allowing some DNA to elute
from the band for a few hours at room temperature in
TE (1mM EDTA, 10mM Tris, pH8). 1 ul of the eluate
is good as PCR template. It can be worth removing
the backing paper after the gel has rehydrated and is
easily peeled oﬀ.
The way that I extract PCR ampliﬁed fragments from
MDE gels (usually 0.4X or 0.5X gels) or any polyacry-
lamide gels in that matter, is by using QIAGEN Gel
Extraction Kit. I use the exact same protocol as for
extracting fragments from agarose gels, except I add a
minimum of 6 volumes of QG buﬀer to one volume of
gel and then incubate it for 16 h at 55 C. After the
ﬁnal step (i.e., eluting DNA), you can either re-PCR
the puriﬁed fragments and then clean the PCR prod-
uct (recommended) or directly use the eluted DNA for
cloning.November 1, 2005 EvolDir 69
I have ampliﬁed many SSCP bands from acrylamide
gels - usually radiolabelled on dried acrylamide. I place
the excized band - often with paper attached - into 12
- 25 ul of water or 0.1x TE (volume dependent on how
well the product ampliﬁed), centrifuged for a few sec-
onds, then left the bands soaking for a couple of hours at
room temp. Then used 1ul of this as template in a 20ul
pcr. This never fails. I’m not sure how MDE diﬀers
from standard poly acrylamide. I’m guessing that the
ethanol precipitation step in your protocol #1 is where
you lost your product - there is very little product res-
cued from a gel slice, only enough to use a pcr template.
It is likely the TBE inhibited your pcr reaction, try us-
ing the Water or TE and avoid any acrylamide in the
reaction.

Sequencing problem
To all memebers,
I wish to thank all those who have responded to my pre-
vious question regarding my sequencing diﬃculties. I
will post the responses I received within the next week.
However, a few of you said that maybe my primer is not
appropriate for sequencing. Can you please elaborate?
I have discussed this with others and a few thoughts
have arisen, but no concrete reason was given. I was
wondering if anyone has discovered reasons for why a
primer would work well in PCR but does not work for
sequencing.Thank you.

Sequencing problems
To all members,
I was wondering if anyone could help me with my se-
quencing problems. I have been attempting to retrieve
a sequence from a PCR product but have had mini-
mal success. I always seem to get similar sequencing
results and have tried numerous alterations in proto-
col to overcome this. I have altered the denaturation
temperature and annealing temperature, increased and
decreased the amount of template added to the reac-
tion, increased and decreased the number of cycles, I
have even attempted a reaction with additives and still
no success. My sequences are usually unreadable and
seem to consist mainly of Gs and As. However, the
gene fragment to be sequenced does not contain large
G or A stretches.
If anyone could provide me with some advice, it would
be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

Sequencing problems answers
Thank you to all that have responded to my question
regarding sequencing primers. Here are the responses
that I have received. I appologize for the delay in post-
ing.
Respectively, Lucia Iachetta
(1) My understanding of the issue with sequencing vs.
PCR primers (which may not be completely correct) is
that the best PCR primers have the strongest aﬃnity
to their target sequence in the 5’ portion of the primer,
while the best sequencing primers must bind strongly at
the 3’ end. A large determinant of this is the GC con-
tent in diﬀerent portions of the primer. The presumed70 EvolDir November 1, 2005
reason is that in PCR the most important thing is tar-
get speciﬁcity, or only getting ampliﬁcation when the
entire sequence matches the target. This can be assured
by only getting extension (which requires a perfect 3’
end match) when the entire primer has annealed to the
target sequence. Perfect eﬃciency in ampliﬁcation is
not important, as exponential ampliﬁcation should still
generate plenty of product if enough cycles are used.
With sequencing primers, on the other hand, there is
a much more limited number of possible target sites
(e.g. just the PCR product or plasmid that is being se-
quenced), and ampliﬁcation is linear, so eﬃcient gener-
ation of products is the most important criterion. This
requires a strong 3’ match, and one rule of thumb is that
the last several bases of the primer should be at least
50% G+C. I should point out that I have not tested this
empirically but try to keep it in mind when design-
ing sequencing primers or deciding whether my PCR
primers are likely to be useful for sequencing. David
(2) It depends what you mean by “does not work for
sequencing”: Do you have no sequence at all? or do
you have several overlapping sequences?
My guess is that in the ﬁrst case, the PCR product
can fold in such a way that the primer’s pairing (or the
polymerase’s work) is just not possible, it was possible
with the DNA template that could not fold the same
way. (Of course, PCR and sequencing do not necessar-
ily share reaction conditions and may have an eﬀect to
DNA folding too, but if I remember well your previous
e-mail, you already “played” with these parameters.)
In the second case, my guess is that the other primer
used for the PCR was the one that allow a product am-
pliﬁcation, when the ﬁrst primer (the “bad one” !) was
able to pair in diﬀerent regions. When you use the ﬁrst
for sequencing, it will pair in diﬀerent regions too, and
then generate a sequence from each diﬀerent region, the
result will be “overlapping sequences”, not readable at
all. Marie-Pierre
(3) I have often experienced sequencing problem with
long primers ( >= 30 bp) that were working ﬁne for
PCR ampliﬁcation. Just shortening the primer length
(to 20-25 bp) usually solved the problem. Patrick

Software AllelesInSpace
Dear EvolDir readers:A new computer program for spatial analy-
ses of genetic data is available from http://-
www.marksgeneticsoftware.net . The program,
called “Alleles In Space (AIS)”, is designed to facilitate
statistical analyses of inter-individual spatial and
genetic information that may be obtained during
the course of performing phylogeographical analyses
or analyses of local spatial genetic structure. AIS
performs a variety of diﬀerent procedures including
Mantel tests, spatial autocorrelation analyses, allelic
aggregation index analyses, Monmonier’s algorithm,
and “Genetic Landscape Shape” interpolations. Anal-
yses can be performed using codominant marker
systems (such as microsats or allozymes), dominant
marker systems (such as AFLPs or RAPDs), or DNA
sequence data.
The program is designed to run under any 32-bit Win-
dows operating system. However, given that the pro-
gram is inherently graphical in nature, a fast Pentium
III machine with at least 128MB of RAM is suggested.
Detailed instructions for using the program (in the form
of a conventional “Help” ﬁle and a 29-page PDF man-
ual) and some sample data sets are installed with the
software.
Thanks for looking,

Software Clann 3 0
We wish to announce the release of Clann version 3.0.
This version has some signiﬁcant advances (as described
below). See the website at: http://bioinf.nuim.ie/-
software/clann/ For those that don’t know Clann.
Clann is a free software tool licenced under GPL for
combining phylogenetic information. Primarily its fo-
cus is on supertrees but it also carries out consensus
analyses. Clann allows the user to analyse their data
using 5 diﬀerent supertree techniques as well as consen-
sus approaches. The focus of the software is to allow
the user to explore their data, so Clann comes equipped
with many ways of exploring signal within a dataset.
Advances in this version: - The need for the instal-
lation of readline for Mac OS X has been eliminated.
- Fixed Several bugs - New Criterion added: Average
Consensus. Missing Data estimated using either an ul-
trametric or 4 point condition estimate. - NJ tree can
be created using the command ’nj’. This is a neighbor-
joining tree of an average consensus distance matrix of
the data. - Neighbor-joining tree can be used as a start-
ing tree for heuristic searches. - ’Showtrees’ command
added. This allows the user to view selections of the
sourcetrees as ascii trees on the screen. The user can
select the trees to be displayed according to their size,
taxa compliment, score against the best supertree or
according to the name of the trees. The selection can
be saved to ﬁle. - Speciﬁc weights can be assigned to
individual source trees. - ’Excudetrees’ and ’Include-trees’ commands added. This allows the user to either
exclude or include trees from the analysis according to
the size of the tree, the taxa compliment, the score of
the tree against a predeﬁned supertree or according to
the name given to the tree. - ’Deletetaxa’ command
added. This allows the user to select a taxon for dele-
tion from the dataset. This has the eﬀect of pruning the
taxa from each of the source trees in which it appears.
Source trees that have fewer than 4 taxa after any taxa
are deleted are removed from the dataset. - ’Generate-
trees’ command added. This allows the user to generate
random supertrees and assess them against the source
tree data (or against randomised of idealised versions of
the source trees). The results from the generation of su-
pertrees are displayed as a histogram. Statistics about
the distribution are also calculated. This command also
allows the user to create (and save to ﬁle) randomised
or idealised version of their data. - ’Consensus’ com-
mand added. This allows Clann to carry out a con-
sensus analysis of all the universally distributed trees
(those trees that have all the taxa) in the source tree
dataset. The user can choose from doing a majority-
rule, or strict consensus. The results are displayed to
screen in a graphical ascii format. This means that
clann can now be used for the summary of bootstrap
proportions from phylogenetic analyses. - Clann now
also calculates a consensus tree from any bootstrap
analyses it carries out. - Robinson-foulds distances can
now be calculated from the sourcetrees dataset using
the command ’rfdists’. For each comparison between
two source trees, taxa are pruned from both trees until
only the taxa that are shared by both trees remain. The
results of these calculations are saved to ﬁle. The user
has the choice of matrix or vector format. - Clann now
reads nexus format ﬁles. The ﬁle may contain transla-
tion tables or not and this also allows the inclusion of
a ’clann block’. This is a set of commands that are to
be carried out on the data in the ﬁle. Clann will ignore
any data blocks that are not relevant to it. - When
a dataset is executed (loaded into memory) Clann will
now also display a summary of the distribution of sizes
of trees. - Clann will now “catch” ctrl-c signals so that
a search of tree-space may be aborted early. Clann will
display the best supertree found before the ctrl-c signal
was sent.

Software DNASlider
DNA Slider is a program for identifying statistically
signiﬁcant variation in the polymorphism-to-divergence
ratio within a gene. It may be useful for detecting peaks
of polymorphism caused by balancing selection and ar-
eas of low polymorphism caused by selective sweeps.
Almost a third of the Drosophila data sets analyzed
with the program in the original publication had signif-
icant heterogeneity (McDonald, J.H. 1998. Improved
tests for heterogeneity across a region of DNA sequence
in the ratio of polymorphism to divergence. Molecular
Biology and Evolution 15: 377-384.)
The previous version of the program was only available
for Mac OS 7, 8, and 9; I have now written versions for
Windows and Mac OS X. The program, its source code,
and an example data set, are available from http://-

Software RNA-treeﬁnder
One more unpaid TREEFINDER version at:
http://www.treeﬁnder.de See what free work can
achieve!
TREEFINDER is a computer program to compute phy-
logenetic trees from molecular sequences.
New features: empirical rRNA models with secondary
structure, PMB protein model, SH test for user-
supplied topologies, faster computation of edge sup-
port, improved manual.
I still have no position in Munich. Nobody feels re-
sponsible to support my TREEFINDER project. They
say they cannot pay me a fair salary because others
might want a fair salary, too. They say they cannot let
me do my own project because others might want their
own projects, too. They say they cannot let me work
at home because others might want to work at home,too. But if everybody dislikes the system - why don’t
we change it? We are living in a democracy.
Did you know that a patent attorney in Germany gets
a starting salary of 6000 Euros per month? Ironically,
the patent attorney has not spent more eﬀort in his or
her education than a post-doc in biology: University
studies in a natural science or technology, plus three
more years of internships and a special course in laws.
There are good and long-term perspectives for patent
attorneys in Germany.
Did you know that low wages and short-term contracts
make people feel less responsible for their work? If a
project is unsuccessful - who cares. Write an article
about it! Apply for the next job, no matter how un-
interesting it is, no matter where it is - it is just for a
short time. Start some cooperations, have a nice time
traveling to conferences, visiting other discontent sci-
entists until the contract is over. And after all, it was
somebody else’s project, somebody else’s money.
Did you know that paying fair salaries could be cheaper
than trying to cheat?
Too few people deﬁne the goals and directions in sci-
ence, decide about funding regulations, projects, ca-
reers - exquisite experts sharing public money among
themselves, trying to get as much as possible for their
own ﬁelds. The others are welcome to work, but not
to compete. Tax-payers are welcome to pay, but not to
propose. If scientists were elected into positions by a
broad community I would not be unemployed. If fund-
ing was based on a democratic decision I would earn a
fair wage for my work. Academic research would be less
biased by various interest groups, but would be more fo-
cussed on what people really want. There would be less
research on consumer behavior and gene foods without
any taste, but more research on renewable energies, on
developing cars that are clean and faint. We need more
democracy in science. We need a scientiﬁc system that
acts in the interest of science, in the interest of soci-
ety, and not just in the interests of those few who have
managed to become professors by having served other
professors. We need a political system that acts in the
interest of all people and saves our planet, that is ro-
bust against mass stupidiﬁcation, lobbyism, corruption
- someone should invent that, do research on that!
I am still collecting opinions about the ridiculous em-
ployment situation in science and, more importantly,
ideas to improve it. I am interested in examples where
good research has been abandoned due to stupid regu-
lations, or because competent people did no longer ac-
cept the miserable payment and the lack of perspectives
and left. Give me examples of incompetent people who
are now consuming much more tax money for less use-November 1, 2005 EvolDir 73
ful work than properly paid competent people would.
Write me of people in the mid-thirties who are still be-
ing treated like students because they are excluded from
getting their own funding. Write me of cases where
professors have unexpectedly forced their employees to
move to foreign cities, about professors putting their
names on other’s work. Write me everything that can
be used against the system. I will put your comments
on the web so that everybody can read what scientists
think about science. I will not publish anybody’s name
so that nobody must fear any sanctions.
Saying ’yes’ all the time is deﬁnitely not a good strat-
egy, it is the cause of bad treatment. Become politically
active and spread your opinion. Otherwise, the oppres-
sors’ opinion will dominate. Write a few extra lines in
your papers, say a few extra words in your talks, make
a nice website. Join or found a political party. Spread
your opinion until it comes to the right ears. Ridicule
the system, reveal its incompetence. Be creative and
numerous and it will fall!

Symmetry response
A. R. Palmer - a divine guardian of good scientiﬁc prac-
tice, or just another human being?
Palmer has in his recent posting on evoldir stated that
my responses to his questions do not address the issuesabout why there was an absence of symmetric males
among short-tailed males in early samples, but many
such symmetric males in recent samples of barn swal-
lows from my study population in Denmark. However,
I will reiterate once more for Palmer in an attempt to
convey the message. I have show in the manuscript
posted on the website of Prof. T. A. Mousseau by
honestly listing all available information that (i) tail
length of males has increased by over 1.2 standard de-
viations during the last 20 years; (ii) asymmetry in tail
and wing length has decreased dramatically during the
same period; and (iii) the relationship between asym-
metry and tail length in males, but not in females has
changed from being signiﬁcantly negative to being ﬂat
during that period. This addresses exactly Palmer’s
question because it shows that since short-tailed males
(at least by the standards of the 1980’s) are absent or
rare in recent years, this fraction of the population does
no longer contribute to the distribution of asymmetry.
Therefore, there is no deﬁciency of symmetric short-
tailed males any more, because there are hardly any
short-tailed males in the population any more. Finally,
any diﬀerences in individual data points among publi-
cations, as identiﬁed by the detective work of Palmer,
are due to diﬀerences in selection criteria for inclusion
of observations in speciﬁc analyses.
Having read the recent postings by A. P. Palmer on
EvolDir between my other required activities, I have
started to wonder what is the problem at stake. Since
when has a professor at a small university in western
Canada been appointed the universal oracle of all mat-
ters related to asymmetry? Recently, A. R. Palmer has
listed on the web a number of diﬀerent ﬁndings from
his analyses of some of my papers. He has in addition
posted a number of questions that he apparently imag-
ined that I had to answer in public on the internet until
he some future day felt satisﬁed with the replies. This
entire procedure seems utterly absurd to me because
as far as I know Palmer has never been elected over-
seer in these or any other matters. He has no legal or
moral obligation or right to pursue what he is doing. At
worst, his behavior reminds me more of prosecutions in
certain medieval societies, or in certain parts of North
America a couple of hundred years ago when the same
person was acting as sheriﬀ, judge and guard of the
local prison.
If A. R. Palmer had a saintly or godly behavior that
made him a superior of others, I might be able to un-
derstand his ways. However, that appears not to be
the case. When Palmer wrote a piece for the newslet-
ter of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology
a couple of years ago, the president of the society, Prof.
N. B. Davies, wrote in the subsequent issue that all fu-74 EvolDir November 1, 2005
ture contributions to the newsletter would be required
to reach certain minimum standards in terms of normal
collegial behavior. Furthermore, Palmer has as the se-
nior author of a paper published in Evolution in 1997
reproduced four ﬁgures from four other papers without
requesting permission to reproduce these from the copy-
right holders. That was done against the advice of at
least one referee who recommended that he not proceed
with this illegal behavior. Hence, Palmer clearly has no
rights based on a higher moral standing to pursue what
he is doing.
I would be happy to share data sets with others, as
I have done hundreds of times including with Palmer
himself. However, I do not subscribe to the idea that
a single person should be allowed to conduct personal
vendettas under the disguise of promoting a fair society
of scientists devoid of dishonesty and fraud. When such
activities are left in the hands of single individuals they
often become tools to meet the desires of that individual
rather than a fair and open-minded inquiry, as I have
already explained in detail in my recent article in the
newsletter of the International Society for Behavioral
Ecology. We are all best left without such unsolicited
actions by parties directly or indirectly involved in a
case.
Perhaps A. R. Palmer should focus on his teaching, re-
search or some other activity and stop harassing people
by posting his thoughts and beliefs in public on the in-
ternet. Then I and other persons being scrutinized in
public could be left on their own to pursue their every-
day life at work and at home together with colleagues
and families.
Finally, I would like to invite Palmer or anybody else
interested to personally inspect all data sheets in my
oﬃce at their own expense to erase any doubt about
the existence of the authentic data. I have all my notes
since October 1969 neatly ordered so they are readily
accessible. In

Thought diversity
Dear Brian and All,Since the ID discussion on EvolDir has taken a bit of
a satirical direction (e.g., recent “Other: Guinness’ an-
swer”), I’d like to oﬀer my two cents. If Brian feels
that it’s too oﬀ-topic, and chooses not to post it, I
won’t mind. It does have a serious component, though.
I, too, chose not to sign the recent anti-ID petition,
but for a diﬀerent reason, than Dave Fitch and Nathan
Pearson. I think that responding to ID’s 400 signa-
tures with our 4000 or 40000 deﬁes the main point we
are trying to make: ID is outside of the realm of science.
Why take the discussion down to their level? Scientiﬁc
questions are not answered by vote count. After all,
when Wegener came up with the continental drift or
Belousov discovered what became known as Belousov-
Zhabotinsky reaction, the vote count was one to every-
one else. Instead of taking part in a petition signing
contest, we should point out that creationists of any
creed are, by and large, ridiculous, nearly as much as
ﬂat-Earth proponents would have been today. Hence, I
propose another petition to sign and distribute:
Support alternative points of view in our schools! Stop
the monopoly of the irrational pi theory in school cur-
ricula!
For years on end our children are presented with only
one point of view on the value of the number pi. They
are told by their math teachers that this number equals,
approximately, 3.1415926. Note the word approxi-
mately! Despite centuries of work, there is no agree-
ment among scientists on the exact value of this num-
ber. We asked 100 respected mathematicians from lead-
ing universities the same two questions: Do you know
the exact value of pi? Does anyone know? All 100, with
not a single exception, answered NO to both questions!
Thus, the ﬁgure 3.1415926, which is presented as a sci-
entiﬁc fact in our textbooks, from elementary schools to
colleges, is based on nothing but theory, with no solid
evidence behind it and with no agreement among this
theory’s most ardent supporters on what the precise
value of pi is!
Meanwhile there is an alternative, very unequivocal
point of view. It comes from the Scripture itself. Open
1 Kings and read verse 7:23: ?And he [King Solomon]
made a molten sea, ten cubits from one brim to the
other: it was round all about, and his height was ﬁve
cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round
about?. If a perfectly round object (?round all about?)
has the diameter of 10 cubits and the circumference of
30 cubits, then the value of pi is precisely 3. No mess,
no uncertainty, no irrationality. King Solomon knew
what he was doing. We believe that it’s time to end
the monopoly of the so called irrational theory of pi on
the heads of our children. The two theories must be
presented as equal points of view and given the sameNovember 1, 2005 EvolDir 75

Let the kids decide!

Transilluminators
Hi All
Transilluminators We are looking at purchasing a tran-
silluminator - for quite basic use reading bands and tak-
ing photos - no cutting/cloning etc. We will be using it
in a dark room.
Currently we use a UV transilluminator and Ethid-
ium Bromide staining and it has been suggested that
we might consider switching to one of the Dark
Reader transilluminators (e.g. Clare Chemical Re-
search DR88M Transilluminator to avoid the UV light
etc.
I would be grateful to hear from people who have ex-
perience with this type of transilluminator.
Is the resulting visualisation comparable with that of
UV transilluminators - I understand it may not be as
useful with Ethidium Bromide...
Digital Cameras We are also looking at the possibility
of obtaining a good commercial digital camera (aimed
at public rather than lab work) to use with this set up
(as opposed to a gel documentation system) and would
be grateful for any advice from people operation this
type of system.

and models, explanations at all levels, in the classroom.
Throwing ID into the mix would appear to students to
validate this agenda-driven sociopolitical claim as sim-
ilar enough in kind to other scientiﬁc explanations to
merit a similar level of consideration by scientists. This76 EvolDir November 1, 2005
is not only misleading, but it can potentially result in
serious damage to our goal of raising the standards of
scientiﬁc literacy among the general public. I am cer-
tain that the proponents of ID see no chance that so-
called “ID theory” (a misleading rhetorical trick of a
term, which no scientist or journalist should EVER con-
cede to use) will ever inﬁltrate the mainstream of the
scientiﬁc community. They don’t care. Their main ob-
jective is for science teachers to do exactly what David
is recommending. It won’t matter to the students the
Discovery Institute wants to capture politically if the
teacher argues that ID is a poor alternative explana-
tion. The Discovery Institute will have already won
the hearts and minds of those students as soon as ID
is anointed as a legitimate alternative idea. Regardless
of how well the teacher then argues that ID is a poor
alternative, the politically relevant set of students will
then be ready to exercise what they perceive as criti-
cal thinking to disagree with the teacher regarding the
relative quality of the alternatives.
IMHO, we would be playing into the hands of the Dis-
covery Institute if we include ID in any list of alterna-
tive scientiﬁc ideas. I would only bring up ID in the
classroom as an example of sociological pressures that
can be brought to bear on scientists to abandon scien-
tiﬁc principles when science advocates ideas that are
uncomfortable to the scientiﬁcally ignorant.

antiID petition mistake 2
Hello Evol-Dir:
I must say that I’ve followed the whole ID / Evolution
discussion with great interest. I agree with Dr. Fitch
that we have gotten to a point where we can no longer
advocate that ID should not even be mentioned in Bi-
ology classes. We have to teach students why this new
version of creationism is basically ﬂawed. I think Prof.
Dawkins and Dr. Coyne were quite right when stat-
ing, at the end of their article in a British newspaper,
that “it would only take about 10 mins to exhaust the
case for ID”. We also have to teach students how to dif-
ferentiate between scientiﬁc hypotheses and those thatclearly do not follow the scientiﬁc method. I think our
discussion has also missed one crucial point. Intelligent
Design and “pols” from the Discovery Institute are not
only targeting Evolutionary theory but also scientiﬁc
materialism which is the basis of the scientiﬁc method,
of all science! As scientists all our work must be based
on scientiﬁc materialism, there is no room for meta-
physics in scientiﬁc theories. I think any discussion
about Metaphysics does not belong in a science class.
From a purely scientiﬁc point of view we would require
evidence to prove the existence of some designer! But
that is not our ﬁeld of expertise and frankly it has noth-
ing to do with science. Religious beliefs are a personal
matter.
Sincerely,
Alejandro.

antiID petition mistake 3
All,
Like Dave Fitch, I declined to sign the anti-ID petition
(posted on shovelbums.org). His missing signature on
that petition spoke much louder than mine, but I think
it’s worthwhile to convey my reasons for not signing
– especially since some of them run directly counter
to reasons invoked by Fitch. While I agree with Dave
that the petition did nothing to counter IDers’ strate-
gic inattention to non-random evolutionary processes, I
was most dismayed that the petition (at least the draft
I read) bent over backwards to reassure religious folks,
and by extension the well-entrenched societal institu-
tions that they represent, that they and their ancient
ideologies had nothing to fear from evolutionary biol-
ogy. The religion/science never-the-twain-need-conﬂict
tack is hackeneyed, craven, and, worse, false. We err in
assuming that we can simply close our eyes to bald in-
compatibilities between modern scientiﬁc understand-
ing of the world and many of the detailed, empirical,
and patently silly cosmological claims that are integralNovember 1, 2005 EvolDir 77
to much religious dogma.
ID, of course, falls in squarely with the latter. As was
noted in a prior Evoldir thread, the core claims of ID
are anything but metaphysical; rather, they are explicit
claims about physics, positing that the material ’com-
plexity’ (however one measures the latter) that we ob-
serve implies that some quite -real- (if yet undetected)
and – here’s the rub – even more complex designer re-
ally exists. Even as a fanciful tidbit to be chewed over
in a philosophy course, ID has a, well, damning logical
ﬂaw at its core: the spontaneous manifestation of a suf-
ﬁciently complex ’designer’ would violate the theory’s
own key claim about how complexity can arise. More-
over, key proponents of ID have famously resorted to
sleight-of-math (e.g. Dembski’s curiously crucial omis-
sion of a log term in ostensibly invoking Claude Shan-
non’s deﬁnition of information) and have appealed to
nonsense like accepting ’microevolution’ but rejecting
’macroevolution’ (as if the two are rigorously qualita-
tively distinct); positing that any new fossil discovery
just adds another ’missing link’ that evolutionists must
answer for; &c.
The petition we were asked to sign, in its eagerness
to appease potential allies in relatively liberal religious
institutions, glossed over inescapable conﬂict between
modern scientiﬁc cosmology its fossilized, but still well-
entrenched antecedents. Moreover, the petition ne-
glected to even allude to the speciﬁc logical ﬂaw(s) in-
herent in ID that render it a ludicrous theory to spend
time on even in a philosophy course; to grant ID signif-icant airtime even in a ’non-science’ curriculum seems
like a disservice to public school students, and ulti-
mately to our own interests as beneﬁciaries of voters’
largesse. It’s disappointing that such a big, coordinated
response from the scientiﬁc community would end up
being this sort of intellectually soft-pedaled, needlessly
apologetic statement. Perhaps a more forthright com-
munal position statement on the matter is in order.

g1 phylogeny statistics
Dear all,
I am actually analysing MtDNA sequences and look-
ing for methods to test for phylogenetic signal, apart
from the resampling analyses (bootstrap). Several pa-
pers refered to the g1 statistics, but I could not ﬁnd the
way to calculate this value and the associated p values.
I would be very gratefull to get some advices.

AtlanticSalmon ConservationGenet
Postdoc and Ph.D. positions in Atlantic Salmon Con-
servation genetics: Positions are available for two post-
doctoral fellows and two Ph.D. students at to work on
the conservation genetics of wild Atlantic salmon. The
postdoctoral fellowship positions begin in April 1, 2006
and are funded for two years. The Ph.D. positions be-
gin in January or May 2006 and are initially funded for
three years.
The project is lead by Dr. Elizabeth Boulding (U.
Guelph) with co-investigators Dr. Ian Fleming (Memo-
rial University of Newfoundland) and Dr. Patricia
Schulte (U.B.C.). We are collaborating with Drs.
Patrick O’Reilly and Brian Glebe of the Department
of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (DFO), Dr. Fred
G. Whoriskey, Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF), Dr.
Keng Pee Ang of Marine Harvest, and Dr. Paloma
Moran from the University of Vigo, Spain. This project
involves looking for correlations between gene expres-
sion polymorphisms and morphological, behavioural,
life history, and physiological traits in Atlantic salmon,
and determining the extent to which these correlations
have an underlying genetic basis. Atlantic salmon of
the inner Bay of Fundy (iBoF), including the Upper
Salmon River run, are listed by the Committee on the
Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC)
and thus have been the subject of a breeding pro-
gram by DFO. Researchers at DFO have used molecular
markers to demonstrate that approximately 10% of the
smolts obtained from the Upper Salmon River (located
in Fundy National Park), are F1 hybrids between Eu-
ropean aquaculture and North American (likely native
Upper salmon ﬁsh). In the ﬁrst part of our project the
F1 “Trans Atlantic” individuals he identiﬁed will be
backcrossed back to one of the parental populations to
create two large full sib research families that will be
segregating for the alleles that are unique to each of the
original parental strains.
The Fleming Ph.D. student will then compare the mor-
phometric, life history, and behavioural traits of thebackcrossed strains with those of each of the pure
strains raised at constant density at the Mactaquac
Biodiversity Centre near Fredericton, New Brunswick.
This will allow us to identify functional candidate genes
that are correlated with the diﬀerences in complex
growth and behaviour (aggressiveness/dominance, risk
aversion, boldness) and life history (early parr matu-
rity) traits previously shown by Fleming et al. to exist
between domesticated and wild Atlantic salmon. The
Fleming Ph.D. student will also quantify functional
trait diﬀerences, and outbreeding depression by rear-
ing crosses from three iBoF populations at the Mac-
taquac Biodiversity Centre. In addition, wild native
salmon with known pedigrees and with diﬀerent lev-
els of cumulative domestication, will be crossed within
populations, reared in captivity and released into the
wild. Survival, growth and other characteristics will be
and monitored over time in captivity and in the wild
to study the eﬀects of captive rearing and breeding on
salmon.
The Schulte postdoc, working at UBC, will use Genome
Canada’s GRASP microarray, which contains 16,000
diﬀerent genes from salmonid ﬁshes, to document dif-
ferences in mRNA levels in tissues of ﬁsh of the same
age from iBoF salmon populations reared in a com-
mon environment. Our use of microarrays is unique
because our segregating backcross families will enable
us to use a statistically powerful method to identify
candidate genes whose expression level polymorphisms
(ELPs) are strongly correlated with particular values of
morphological, behavioural, physiological and life his-
tory traits for individuals within each of our full sib
families.
In the third part of our project, the Boulding postdoc
(working at Guelph) will determine which of these cor-
relations between ELPs and the complex traits have a
genetic basis. This will be done by comparing the DNA
sequences of the candidate gene and look for SNPs (sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphisms) that vary in sequence
between the North American and European parental
populations. In collaboration with O’Reilly, the Bould-
ing Ph.D. student will then use our most promising SNP
markers to genotype ﬁn clips from the backcrossed wild
Atlantic salmon families. We will also genotype these
SNPs in families from backcrossed North American andNovember 1, 2005 EvolDir 79
European aquacultural strains which will be held in a
common hatchery tanks at St. Andrews Biological Sta-
tion under the supervision of Brian Glebe. This will
enable us to document statistical associations between
SNPs in candidate genes and genetic diﬀerences in com-
plex traits among these endangered salmon populations
which, may assist in their conservation. Development
of these SNP genetic markers will eventually enable the
aquaculture industry to practice marker-assisted selec-
tion for complex traits within the St. John’s Aquacul-
ture strain that is authorized for use in New Brunswick.
Please apply for the postdoctoral positions with Dr.
Boulding

Post-doctoral position in craniofacial evolution and de-
velopment in avians
Research Topic: We are mainly interested in pre-
cise links between developmental genes and evolution
of craniofacial structures in vertebrates, particularly
avians and related groups.
Main research projects: - Molecular and genetic mech-
anisms of evolution of beak morphology in Darwins
Finches. Darwins Finches are a classic example of mor-
phological adaptive evolution in a group of closely re-
lated species. - Genomic analysis of regulatory changes
during evolution of key craniofacial genes found to be
important in beak evolution. For example, we previ-
ously found that regulation of expression of Bmp4 sig-
naling molecule correlated with morphological change
in Darwins Finches. We will search for speciﬁc genomic
alterations in this gene to ﬁnd the exact causes for mor-
phological change. - Evolution of craniofacial morphol-ogy in other avian groups. We will use the data ob-
tained from Darwins Finches to formulate and test hy-
pothesis pertaining the diversity of avian craniofacial
structures.

Postdoctoral / Research Associate Position in the Evo-
lution of Bacterial Interactions
We are seeking a motivated individual with ex-
pertise in microbiology for a new project evaluat-
ing the role of pathogen relatedness on host ex-
ploitation and virulence evolution. This project
is a collaboration between Curt Lively and Farrah
Bashey ( http://www.bio.indiana.edu/facultyresearch/-
faculty/Lively.html/ ) that integrates strategic model-
ing with laboratory experimentation.
Steinernema carpocapsae is an insect-parasitic nema-
tode that has a mutualistic relationship with the bac-
terium Xenorhabdus nematophila. For the last year, we
have been using an experimental evolution approach to
test the eﬀect of parasite relatedness on the evolution
of host exploitation. To date, we have been focusing on
the evolutionary responses of the nematode; however,
in the next year we will expand our work to assess the
evolutionary responses of the bacteria. The immediate
aims involve testing our experimental strains as well as
all available Xenorhabdus strains for variation in sen-
sitivity and production of bacteriocins. The candidate
would be responsible for setting up our laboratory to
run these assays; consequently, the position suits can-
didates with a strong background in microbiology that
have good organizational and trouble-shooting abilities.
Additionally, we are hoping for a candidate with skills
in molecular biology that have the creativity to be in-
volved in future experiments focusing on the dynamics
of virulence evolution.
This position provides an exciting opportunity to join
a highly interactive lab and to train in evolutionary bi-
ology. The research environment at IUB is outstanding
(http://www.bio.indiana.edu/ ) and the successful can-
didate will be able to participate in all the scholarly
activities of the Department as well as attend confer-82 EvolDir November 1, 2005
ences, prepare manuscripts and contribute to grant ap-
plications.
The position is currently funded for one year starting
January 1, 2006. We are primarily interested in can-
didates with a Ph.D. degree in microbiology with an
interest in evolutionary biology; however, we will con-
sider experienced applicants without a Ph.D. Salary is
$32 K (plus beneﬁts). If you are interested, please email
the Personnel Manager (malockha@indiana.edu) with
a CV, statement of research interests, and the names,
phone numbers and email addresses of three references.
Please direct all inquiries about the position to Curt
Lively (clively@indiana.edu). Women and minorities
are particularly encouraged to apply. We will begin re-
viewing applications as soon as they are received and
will continue to do so until the position is ﬁlled.

Lund University announces a position for Postdoctoral
Research Fellow (reference no.4794) that will be aﬃl-
iated with a newly started Centre for Genomic Ecol-
ogy ( www.biol.lu.se/ekologi/CGE/ ). A key ambition
within the research programme of the centre is to im-
prove our understanding of the molecular and genetic
mechanisms behind key evolutionary processes such as
adaptation to environmental change, evolutionary dif-
ferentiation and speciation. Such mechanisms could be
manifested at diﬀerent levels of biological organization
from molecules and cells to organisms and populations.
The applicant’s should have a strong empirical and/or
theoretical research background in areas related to the
research programme of the Centre and could include,
but are not limited to ﬁelds like experimental evolu-
tion, developmental biology, theoretical evolutionary
biology, molecular ecology, evolutionary ecology, evo-
lutionary genomics/genetics and population biology.

We seek to appoint an ecologist with an under-
standing of parasitology and an interest in com-
munity structure to start work with a large team
on an exciting new grant from NSF studying the
parasite community dynamics of small mammals
(Grant abstract: http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward.do?AwardNumber=0520468 ). This project
will investigate how a community of parasites is shaped
at the level of the individual host and the consequences
this has for the dynamics of parasitic infections at the
population level using a mixture of ﬁeld and lab exper-
iments coupled with mathematical modeling.
The post-doc will be expected to carry out ﬁeld and
lab experiments and ideally should have experience of
both, with the greater emphasis on ﬁeldwork.
Desirable skills include:
- Field organisation skills, especially familiarity with
small mammal systems - Knowledge of experimental
design - Good statistical knowledge, e.g. GLM’s and re-
peated measures analyses - Database management and
team work

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY
PLANT ECOLOGY Department of Biology, University
of Fribourg, Fribourg (Switzerland)
Rationale: The European knapweed Centaurea macu-
losa, introduced from Central Europe into North Amer-
ica during the late 19th century, where it covers now
an area larger than Switzerland, has become a model
for research on the ecological and evolutionary causes
and consequences of invasions. We aim to explore the
role of rapid evolutionary processes in the invasion suc-
cess of C. maculosa. This involves the analysis of selec-
tion exerted by herbivorous insects (biocontrol agents)
on plant life-histories in diﬀerent environments and the
study of genetic factors (especially polyploidisation) un-
derlying evolutionary change in the exotic range.
We seek a highly motivated person to conduct quanti-
tative genetic experiments in the ﬁeld and greenhouse,
and various lab studies (molecular markers, ﬂow cytom-
etry) using seed material collected in Europe and North
America. Surveys of cpDNA sequence variation and cy-
totype distributions are currently under way. New ideas
and complementary studies are of course highly invited.
Requirements: - doctoral degree in experimental plant
ecology or evolution, or related disciplines; - knowledgeNovember 1, 2005 EvolDir 87
of, and experience in one or several of the following ar-
eas of research is highly desirable: population ecology,
ecological genetics, plant-herbivore interactions, exper-
imental design and statistics.
Salary and conditions: Salary dependent on age and
status (gross salary in the ﬁrst year about CHF 67’000).
Start date: preferentially on 1 March 2006. The posi-
tion will also include support of research activities of
our group. The position is for 2 years, but may be
extended depending on funding.
Applications: Applicants should send their CV, includ-
ing the publication list, a short summary of research
experience and interests, and the names of two pro-
fessional referees to the address below (preferably by
e-mail). Deadline is 1 December 2005.

Postdoc position: Molecular Genetics & Symbiosis We
are seeking a highly motivated postdoc with a strong
background in molecular biology to join our group
working on mechanisms of evolution in symbiotic my-
corrhizal fungi. These important fungi form mutual-
istic symbioses with plant roots. Although the fungi
grow clonally, they have a highly unusual genome or-
ganization, harbouring genetically diﬀerent nuclei that
are passed from one generation to the next (see Hi-
jri & Sanders, Nature 2005; Kuhn, Hijri & Sanders,
Nature 2001). The goals of our research are to un-November 1, 2005 EvolDir 89
derstand how this unusual organization of the genome
aﬀects their evolution and their adaptation to the diﬀer-
ent environments oﬀered by the roots of diﬀerent plant
species. Other than their unusual genome organization,
the fungi have formed symbioses with plants ever since
they colonized land over 400 million years ago and are
thought to be the oldest putative ancient asexuals.
The candidate should should have a good knowledge
of molecular biology and molecular genetics and have
an interest in applying this knowledge to evolution-
ary questions. He/she should also be able to interact
with the other group members working on evolution
and population biology of mycorrhizal fungi (see list of
recent papers on our web site).

UNebraska ArachnidsPost-doctoral Fellowship to study Amblypygids (Class
Arachnida, Order Amblypygi)
I am looking for a neuroethologist with a strong back-
ground in invertebrate electrophysiology to join a re-
search project exploring the neural basis of complex be-
havior in amblypygids. Research will involve some com-
bination of extracuticular recordings, behavioral trials
in conjunction with neural ablations, neuroanatomy,
and behavioral trials investigating the potential for am-
blypygid learning, memory and spatial orientation. The
project will likely involve a ﬁeld component. Funding is
currently available for 2 years. Applicants should have
received their PhD and be available as early as January
2006.
Amblypygids are bizarre and unique arachnids with a
sensory system unlike any other in the animal kingdom.
Not only do they possess giant interneurons with pe-
ripheral cell bodies in their antenniform legs, but they
also boast the largest relative mushroom body of any
arthropod. My experience with these fascinating an-
imals has been one of continual discovery and inter-
ested applicants should be adventurous, patient, and
creative.

Postdoctoral Research Assistant(s): 2 Positions:
(1) Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Genome-
Wide Association Studies (3 years) (2) Statistical Meth-
ods for Geographical Population Structure in Genetic
Studies (4 years)90 EvolDir November 1, 2005
Academic-related Research Staﬀ Grade 1A: Salary
£20,044 to £30,002 (bar) per annum
Two ﬁxed-term research positions, both funded by the
Wellcome Trust, are available to work in the research
group of Professor Peter Donnelly, on statistical issues
in modern genetic studies. The posts would commence
on January 1, 2006, or at a diﬀerent time by arrange-
ment. Well-qualiﬁed successful applicants are likely to
be appointed at or near the top of the salary scale given
above.
The ﬁrst post relates to the development, study, and ap-
plication of novel statistical methods for genome-wide
association studies for human diseases. Although the
focus of the post is on methodological development, it is
associated with the Wellcome Trust Case Control Con-
sortium, a UK-wide collaboration which will perform
large genome-wide association studies on eight common
human diseases, and represents an exciting opportunity
to be involved in one of the largest studies of its type
internationally. Professor Donnelly chairs the consor-
tium.
The second post concerns the development of statistical
methods for inferring geographical population structure
on the basis of genetic data, and how best to account for
structure in genetic association studies. Again, the pri-
mary focus of the post is methodological, but it is asso-
ciated with a large Wellcome Trust-funded study which
will sample and genotype around 3,000 individuals to
assess UK population structure empirically. There will
be close involvement with the data generated by this
project.
For the ﬁrst post, candidates should have a strong back-
ground in modern statistics and its application. For the
second post, a background in either modern statistics
or statistical population genetics is necessary. Good
computational skills are essential for both posts, and
candidates should have, or expect soon to have, a doc-
torate. An existing background in genetics applications
would be an advantage for both posts, but candidates
wishing to move into the genetics ﬁeld are also wel-
come to apply. The Department of Statistics in Oxford
is one of the largest and strongest in the UK, and a
world leader in statistical genetics.
Informal enquiries should be directed to don-
nelly@stats.ox.ac.uk. Further particulars are available
from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk, or the address below.
Applications should comprise a curriculum vitae and a
list of publications together with the names, addresses,
telephone, fax and e-mail details of three referees. Ap-
plicants should make clear for which of the posts they
are applying, or whether they wish to be considered forboth posts.
Applications (7 copies, one copy for candidates outside
the UK) should be submitted to Personnel Administra-
tion, Department of Statistics, 1 South Parks Road,
Oxford, OX1 3TG. Applications faxed to +44 1865
272595 or e-mailed to jobs@stats.ox.ac.uk are accept-
able as long as they are followed by hard copy. Please

Postdoctoral Research Assistant: Academic-related Re-
search Staﬀ Grade 1A
Salary: £20,044 to £30,002 (bar) p.a.
A postdoctoral research position of up to two years
and two months (26 months) duration in Bioinformatics
funded by BBSRC is available for working in the Bioin-
formatics Group headed by Jotun Hein. This project
will focus on models of sequence evolution that includes
a process of insertion-deletion of nucleotides and their
implementation. The work will include algorithm de-
velopment, statistical modelling, software development
and large scale comparative analysis of genomes.
The Research Project: Practical Statistical Alignment
Although bioinformatics is perceived as a new disci-
pline, certain parts have a long history and could be
viewed as classical bioinformatics. For example, ap-
plication of string comparison algorithms to sequence
alignment has a history spanning the last three decades.
The present project will develop, implement and simul-
taneously apply methods including insertion-deletions
of nucleotides/amino acids to give a full model of se-
quence evolution.
The key goals of this project are:
i. Software package: A central aim of the project is to
develop a package doing Bayesian statistical alignment
for many sequences and performs a series of essential
associated analyses: hypothesis testing for molecular
clock, phylogeny, mutation rate, selection estimation,
assessing ancestral sequences, and structure prediction.
ii. Development of better biological models and cor-November 1, 2005 EvolDir 91
responding algorithms: The TKF91 model allows only
single insertions and deletions which is biologically ir-
relevant. Modelling long insertions and deletions is nec-
essary to make statistical alignment practical.
iii. Structure prediction: Most of the comparative
structure prediction methods are based on alignments,
which might be misleading when the alignment is
wrong. Statistical alignment will improve this.
iv. Comparative genomics: Since statistical alignment
is based on a general model of molecular evolution in-
cluding both insertions and deletions, issues related to
the nature of these events can be addressed and param-
eterized.
Applications for the PDRA post are invited from re-
searchers interested in working on this high-impact
project.Candidates should have a relevant background
and research experience in computer science, mathe-
matics, statistical modelling and computational biol-
ogy. A PhD, or equivalent research experience, would
be required.

Post Doctoral position available in the Department of
Genetics, University Stellenbosch, South Africa (10 Okt
2005)
A Post Doctoral position in biotechnology is available
in the Aquaculture Division, Department of Genetics,
Stellenbosch University with the project title “Genetic
improvement of the abalone Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the Western, Southern and Eastern shores of
South Africa and is the only one of the six species that
occurs in South Africa that is commercially exploited.
H. midae displays a very slow growth rate, taking two
to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an obstacle
in the proﬁtable farming and global competitiveness of
this species. In order to increase the productivity and
the proﬁtability of the commercial activity, a research
program has been designed that makes use of the mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. The research program consists of three main
tears: a) establishment of breeding programs with the
assistance of genetic markers, b) generation of linkage
maps and QTL identiﬁcation, c) and the application of
gene transfer technology.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for establishing gene transfer technology in the per-
lemoen, Haliotis midae. This is an extremely exciting
new project that will establish a biotechnology platform
for abalone in southern Africa. This will be the ﬁrst
biotechnology application to a species used for com-
mercial application in Africa. Applicable knowledge in
gene transfer system, especially in aquatic species (ﬁn-
ﬁsh or shellﬁsh) will be a strong recommendation The92 EvolDir November 1, 2005

UWyoming LineageSpeciﬁcEvol
From December, 2005, the Liberles Research Group will
have moved from University of Bergen (Norway) to Uni-
versity of Wyoming (USA). The research group works
on detecting and characterizing lineage-speciﬁc evolu-
tion using a combination of experimental and computa-
tional approaches. The computational approaches in-
clude modeling, comparative sequence analysis, meth-
ods development, and database generation. The exper-
imental approaches involve sequencing rapidly evolv-
ing genes from groups of closely related species, phy-
logenetic analysis including ancestral sequence recon-
struction, and ultimately functional assays involving ei-
ther cell culture or protein expression. A postdoctoral
position is available for someone interested in compu-
tational or experimental evolutionary comparative ge-
nomics (broadly deﬁned). If you are interested, please
send me a cover letter, your c.v., contact information
for two references, and your two favorite papers that
you have published.

Two-year postdoctoral opportunity at for an evolu-
tionary morphologist to study heretofore undescribed
clades of the Phylum Placozoa with Leo Buss’ group
at the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology
and the Peabody Museum, Yale University, New Haven
CT USA.
The Phylum Placozoa, the simplest and probably the
basal- most extant metazoan, was once thought to be
a monotypic taxon, comprised of the single species Tri-
choplax adhaerens. In recent years, it has become clear
that the phylum is comprised of at least four diﬀerent
widely divergent clades.
The wide divergence is known, however, only from se-
quence and mt genome structure data. Diﬀerences
in their morphology & ultrastructure, while surely
present, have yet to be characterized. My lab has col-
lected placozoan material from several localities and es-
tablished multiple representatives of each of the known
clades in laboratory culture. Thus, the material is on
hand to address the problem.
While the post-doctoral position is intended for a mor-
phologist, my lab group is also involved in ongoing ﬁeld
work and molecular work on aspects of placozoan diver-
sity and candidates that might wish to add these areas
of competence to that background in morphology are
welcome to apply.
The position is expected to be funded by an internal
Yale fellowship, which has an application (2 page) dead-
line of 9 December 2005. Applications to this deadline
typically have a start date of 7/06 - 9/06, although some
ﬂexibility is possible in this regard. The salary is $40K
and comes with a $2K contingency fund and with full
medical beneﬁts.
Candidates with prior SEM and ﬁne structure experi-
ence are urged to contact leo.buss@yale.edu with their
CV’s.

gramme, Department of Biological and Environmental
Sciences (University of Helsinki), in conjunction with
the EcoClim Project (Nordic Centre of Excellence), and
the Department of Geology (University of Helsinki), is
organising a workshop on the Ecological Responses to
Climate Change at the Viikki Campus, southern Fin-
land, on November 3 to 4, 2005.
Website: http://www.helsinki.ﬁ/bioscience/-
spatialecology/workshop8.html The goal of the
meeting is to review climate related changes in Earths
biota as they have been observed at diﬀerent spatial,
temporal, and ecological scales and to discuss the
nature of the underlying processes, in particular the
biological and technical reasons for scale-dependence
(or lack thereof). Within this framework, main focal
points are spatial patterns and rates of change. The
meeting is organised around three scaling levels:
coarse (global to subcontinental, 10 ^4 10 ^7 a, biomes,
provinces), intermediate (regional, 10 ^2 10 ^3 a,
ecosystems, communities) and ﬁne (local, annual to
decennial, populations).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.November 1, 2005 EvolDir 95
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
