The 30th Workshop on Mathematical and Statistical
Aspects of Molecular Biology (MASAMB) will be held
in Budapest on April 18 and 19, 2020.
Registration is open until March 10, 2020. For details
see http://masamb2020.elte.hu and below.
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running series of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression, pro-
teomic, metabolomic and single-cell genomics technolo-
gies. These immense data resources, and the underlying
complexities of molecular and cell biology, provide ex-
citing research opportunities for numerate scientists.With typically around 80-120 participants from mathe-
matics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, biol-
ogy and related elds, the MASAMB meetings provide
an intimate setting for exchanging ideas in method-
ological and applied research. Research students and
scientists newly entering the eld of genomic research
are particularly welcome and encouraged to submit ab-
stracts. Details of previous meetings are available at the

Heidelberg EvolSexualDimorphism
Sep20-22
EMBOjEMBL Symposium: The Molecular Basis and
Evolution of Sexual Dimorphism
Symposium Overview
Females and males display striking patterns of sexual
dimorphism in many animals and other organisms. Dif-
ferences are documented in morphology, physiology and
behaviour. In recent years, advances in genomics tech-
nologies have facilitated the discovery of genetic mecha-
nisms underlying sex-specic phenotypes, showing that
sex-biased expression of hundreds to thousands of genes
across the genome contributes to male and female phe-
notypic dierences. The sex-specic evolutionary forces
shaping sexual dimorphisms have also begun to be un-
ravelled, including the interactions between 'master' sex
determining genes on the sex chromosomes, and othergenes during development to control sex-biases of other
genes.
This symposium will focus on the molecular basis and
evolution of sexual dimorphism across animals and other
organisms, including the origins, evolution and biology
of sex chromosomes. It will cover topics ranging from
the evolution of sex determining systems, sex linkage
and sex chromosomes, sex-biased gene expression (on
autosomes and sex chromosomes) and X chromosome
dosage compensation mechanisms, to the evolution of
associated dimorphic phenotypes and the underlying
selective pressures.
Session Topics
- The diversity of genetic sex determining regions and sex
chromosomes - Evolutionary challenges for sex-linked
genome regions: Genetic degeneration and dosage com-
pensation - Adaptive evolution: Evolution of sexually
dimorphic phenotypes and gene expression, sexual an-
tagonism - Sexual dimorphism in human disease

Netherlands NLSEB 21Apr2020
Dear colleague,
We would like to invite you to the third conference of the
Netherlands Society for Evolutionary Biology (NLSEB)
on Tuesday 21 April 2020 in Ede.
Registration and call for abstracts are now open: http:/-
/nlseb.nl/meetings/ With this yearly NLSEB confer-
ence, we aim to bring together scientists from all disci-
plines working on evolutionary questions, and build a
broad community of evolutionary biologists based in the
Netherlands. Therefore, the conference oers a broad
overview of the topics and questions within evolutionary
biology, reected in three exciting plenary talks.
- Toby Kiers (VU Amsterdam) \The evolution of sym-
biotic dependency" - Thijs Ettema (Wageningen UR)
\The archaeal origin of the eukaryotic cell" - Mark van
Vugt (VU Amsterdam) \Two evolutionary pathways to
leadership and hierarchy"
Talks and posters are organised entirely bottom-up: we
want to know what YOU are working on, without any
subject limitation. We will select 16 oral contributions
(15 min. including discussion) and 12 poster pitches (2
min.), and there will be ample room and time for poster
viewing. Registration of abstracts for talks and posters
is open until 14 February 2020.
See for the provisional program http://nlseb.nl/-

EvolutionOfReproduction July15-17
Dear Colleagues,
We are happy to invite you to the rst Satellite meet-
ing of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) dedicated to the Evolution of Reproduction
(https://igc.events.idloom.com/smbe evorepro). This
meeting will take place July 15-17 in Oeiras, Portugal,
at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci^ encia.
In this groundbreaking meeting we aim to establish the
rst cross-disciplinary network dedicated to the Evolu-
tion of Reproduction. Our objective is to tackle three
outstanding biological questions: i- What are the ori-
gins of sexual reproduction? ii- How does evolution
constrain the function of reproductive cells? iii- What
can evolution teach us about infertility?
Our family-friendly event encourages the interaction
between scientists from dierent backgrounds and at
dierent career stages: all speakers will be given a 30-
minute time slot and poster presenters will be able to
promote their work in a \1 minute + 1 slide" ash talk.
We place particular emphasis on the participation of
those at early stages of their career: registration fees are
low and we have a travel grant program (limited num-
bers) to support the attendance of graduate students,
postdocs and early career professionals.
Please check the ocial website (https://-
igc.events.idloom.com/smbe evorepro) to know
more about our outstanding invited speakers, unique
program and commitment to diversity & inclusiveness.
Participant number is limited and registration is re-
quired. Please register before March 15th 2020 (https:/-

EvolutionOfReproductiveSystems
Last few days to submit your proposals to our sympo-
sium \Evolution of reproductive systems : beyond the
usual suspects" at SMBE (june 28- july 2) in beautiful
Qu ebec city !
All details below and at http://smbe2020.org Hope to
see you there ! Vincent et Christelle.
Organisers
Christelle Fra sse, Institute of Science and Technology
Austria, Austria
Vincent Castric, CNRS - University of Lille, France
Invited Speaker
Melinda Pickup, University of Vienna, Austria The
mechanisms by which living organisms reproduce are
strikingly diverse, including sexual reproduction w/o
sex chromosomes or mating-types, self-fertilisation, self-incompatibility or asexuality. The recent years have
drastically enriched our understanding of the genetic
and ecological factors driving the way mating systems
evolve and diversify, how species transition from one to
another, as well as of the consequences of these transi-
tions for the ecology, demography and genomic diversity
of natural populations. Notably, identication of the
molecular determinants of a number of reproductive
systems contributes to the development of more realistic
models of mating system transitions and diversication.
In parallel, there is growing recognition that mating
systems interact with wider set of life history traits than
generally considered, with important consequences on
the eective population size and patterns of gene ow.
New exciting avenues are also being explored regard-
ing the feedback between genome dynamics and mating
system transitions, such as changes in transposable el-
ements regulation or accumulation of the genetic load.
These outcomes are now beginning to be better under-
stood thanks to more realistic theoretical expectations
and advanced molecular approaches. This symposium
will bring new insights into the causes and consequences
of reproductive systems evolution, spotlighting the mul-
tiple feedback loops between genome evolution and re-
productive systems. We encourage contributions illus-
trating the wide variety of methods employed in the
eld, such as theoretical population genetics, compara-
tive genomics and expression analyses, eld experiments
or experimental approaches on diverse study organisms.

Within-individual genome variation and germline / soma
distinction Genomes are typically considered static/xed
across cell types and/or life stages within an organism,
with changing transcriptional patterns resulting in cell
dierentiation and specialization. Yet, various within-
individual genomic changes have been observed during
development in many species across the tree of life. Such
changes include ploidy variation, amplication or elimi-
nation of specic parts of the genome, and chromosome
rearrangements with potentially important consequences
that include cell fate, sex determination and dosage
compensation as well as aging. These data demonstrate
that 1) genomes are more dynamic than typically envi-
sioned, 2) eukaryotes can distinguish between somatic
(i.e. exible within species) and germline (i.e. heritable)
genomes, and 3) Mendelian inheritance is insucient
to explain many patterns observed across lineages. Fur-
ther, genome conicts including those involving selsh
genetic elements (i.e. transposable elements, viruses,
B chromosomes), likely underlie some of these genome
processes. Combined with classic approaches such as
cytogenetics and histology, emerging technologies such
as single-cell and long-read sequencing now allow to
study these processes at an unprecedented scale. This
symposium will bring together biologists interested in
within-individual genome dynamics, with a particular
emphasis on germline / soma distinction and how these
processes may impact cell fate, sex determination and
aging. We hope this will help identify central questions
to foster synergy and bring the eld forward.

tionary histories of organisms considering whole genomes
or large fractions of genomes. The abundance of genomic
data for an enormous variety of organisms has enabled
phylogenomic inference of many groups, and this has
motivated the development of a myriad of models and
methods. The MIC-Phy meeting intends to stimulate
a larger debate focus on the main advances and chal-
lenges of the current phylogenetic models, methods and
algorithms that are permitting to make sense of phy-
logenomic data.
Cost: The meeting is sponsored by WWTF and there
is no registration fee.
Workshop: The meeting includes a workshop entitled
*New approaches and methods to phylogeny inference*
that will focus on the polymorphism-aware phylogeny
estimation, including practical exercises based on the
software IQ-TREE and RevBayes.
Keynote speakers: * Ziheng Yang (University College
of London, UK) * Tracy Heath (Iowa State University
of Science and Technology, USA)
Important dates: * Deadline for workshop registration
and abstract submission: March 31, 2020 * Notication
of oral presentation and/or workshop acceptance: April
15, 2020 * Registration deadline: May 1, 2020

YosemiteNatlPark Symbiosis
May15-17
Dear Colleagues,
Registration will SOON be open for the 10th Annual
Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop!
The TENTH annual Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop will
take place on May 15-17, 2020 at the Sierra Nevada
Research Institute, Yosemite National Park.
Keynote speaker 2020: TO BE ANNOUNCED SOON
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our continuing goal is to better integrate the
broad groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis and
microbiome research. Yosemite serves as an ideal site as
it is both beautiful and secluded. This will be our ninth
annual meeting and we have been consistently attracting
scientists from all over the country and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in the mi-
crobiome, cooperation, mutualism, and symbiosis. In
the past we have covered a range of symbiosis topicsfrom ecology and evolution to molecular mechanisms in
dierent model and non-model systems. We would like
to make room for a diverse group of people so we will ini-
tially accept up to 3 lab members per group (including
the PI) on a rst come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held 16-17,
2020, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 15th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting.
Past attendees and talks can be found here: http://-
www.sachslab.com/symbiosis-2015.php Where: SNRS
has a set of cabins in Wawona and all within a short
walk of the conference room. Costs: See details in the
registration page (up soon). We will only be able to
accept credit card payments this year

Auckland BeetleCrypsisEvolution
Two PhD Scholarships: Evolution of Debris-cloaking in
Cryptic Beetles
Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research (MWLR) and
the School of Biological Sciences (SBS), The Univer-
sity of Auckland, New Zealand, has funding for two
suitably motivated and dedicated applicants to apply
for fully funded PhD scholarships to work on the evo-
lution, biomechanics, and function of debris-cloaking
in cryptic beetles of New Zealand. By reconstructing
the evolution of cuticular morphology over phylogenetic
trees, determining the biomechanical properties of bee-
tle surfaces, and testing adaptive hypotheses relating
to their function in camouage, students will explore
factors driving the evolution of this complex mechanism
of protection. The research will include molecular phy-
logenetic research, behavioural studies, and training in
functional morphology with Stanislav Gorb (University
of Kiel, Germany). The exact content of either PhDproject will depend on the research goals and skill of
each student. The successful candidates will be highly in-
dependent, have research experience, a strong academic
record and possess a MSc or Honours research degree in
evolutionary biology, morphology and/or behavioural
ecology.
The students will work under the supervision of Drs Rich
Leschen (MWLR), Greg Holwell (SBS), and Thomas
Buckley (SBS and MWLR), and will have access to a
range of world-class facilities with the opportunity to
travel for both eldwork and collaboration. This posi-
tion is funded for 3 years through the Marsden Fund of
the Royal Society of New Zealand, and the successful
applicant is expected to begin during 2020.
Please submit applications directly to Rich Leschen
(leschenr@landcareresearch.co.nz) and provide a CV,
academic transcript, contact details for three referees,
and a letter detailing your research interests and moti-
vation for considering the project.
Key words: Ultra-conserved elements; adhesive struc-
tures, background mimicry

to investigate the adaptation to climate and plant host
of aphid pests.
Lab address ~A(supervision): PC-Fruit pcfruit vzw Fruit-
tuinweg 1 3800 Sint-Truiden Belgium

Project summary Understanding the extent of local
adaptation in natural populations and the mechanisms
enabling individuals to adapt to their native environ-
ment is a major avenue in evolutionary ecology research.
Host-pathogen coevolution is widely seen as a major
driver of local adaptation and has therefore been a
study model to dissect the evolutionary processes at
work during local adaptation. However, the relative
contributions of species interactions (i.e. biotic factor)
and abiotic factors to local adaptation are still unclear.
Addressing these issues is more than a simple academic
exercise. Understanding of local adaptation processes in
host-parasite interactions will also help tackling pressing
issues, such as the ways in which environmental change
alters the emergence of pathogens leading to host extinc-
tions, how to promote sustainability of agroecosystems
in the face of emerging crop diseases or in guiding for
public health practices as more human pathogens and
their vectors expand their ranges.
In this project, we investigate whether local adaptation
occurred during the recent rapid colonization of culti-
vated apple by Dysaphis plantaginea, the major aphid
pest of cultivated apple orchards, in Europe. We will
carry out in April 2020 experimental tests for D. plan-
taginea tness dierences across environments (i.e. host
and climate) to investigate whether the aphid is locally
adapted to its host and/or climate. This project will
generate original results adding to our understandingof how species interactions and abiotic conditions can
shape local adaptation.
Master project The project involves the transplant of
Belgian, French and Spanish aphid genotypes on Belgian,
French and Spanish apple varieties in three locations
(Belgian, France and Spain). The candidate will be in-
volved in the assessment of the adaptive capacities at the
ecological level of the rosy apple aphid at the BELGIAN
site located at PCFruit (Sint-Truiden, Belgium). The
project can last two (Bachelor) to six months (Master),
and will consist in participating in aphid infestations
and rearing on the eld, tree measurement, associated
statistical analyses, and nal report writing.
1) The candidate will lead the launching of the experi-
ment there during Spring 2020 by transplanting aphids
on several apple cultivars and will measure several phe-
notypic traits. The growth rate of each colony will be
measured after 12 days of infestation. Various functional
traits which are proxies of the condition of the plant
(i.e. chlorophyll content, carbon/nitrogen balance, and
avonol and anthocyanin content measured with the
Dualex ^A pincel) will also be measured.
2) He/She will analyze the dataset that will be gener-
ated.
Methodology: Statistical analyses (linear and mixed
models, R), ecophysiology, phenotypic measurement,
rearing, insect biology, eld experiment.
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-
date will have skills in ecology and evolution or at least
will show strong interest in these elds. He/She will
have to be highly motivated about eld experiment, as
this one will be intense the rst two months. He/she will
not necessarily be familiar with apple or aphid model.
Deadline for submission: The sooner the better.
Duration : 2 to 6 months, August 2020, starting dates
are exible, contact Amandine CORNILLE for further
discussions.

Come join us! We are accepting applicants after the
Clark University Deadline.
A PhD position is available in the laboratory of N eva
Meyer at Clark University in Worcester, MA USA be-
ginning in late August 2020 as follows:
The successful applicant will develop a project focused
on molecular control of neural specication in the an-
nelid Capitella teleta, but this can be expanded to in-
clude other spiralians/lophotrochozoans and dierent
avenues of research depending on the applicant' ^As in-
terests and goals. Possible avenues of research include
analysis of fate specication via blastomere isolation, ge-netic manipulation, and transcriptomic proling. There
will be multiple opportunities for career development,
including mentoring, participating as a guest lecturer
in courses taught by the PI, and attending workshops
such as the Embryology course at the Marine Biological
Laboratories.
Spiralians are a great group of animals to study evolu-
tion of body plans in part because many spiralian taxa
develop via a stereotypic and likely ancestral cleavage
program. Ultimately, this cleavage program results in
formation of highly diverse body plans. Research in
Dr. Meyer' ^As lab is currently focused on understanding
how centralized nervous systems evolved. The research
community that studies evolution and development of
spiralians is rapidly growing and is very welcoming and
collaborative.
The successful applicant will enter Clark University's
Biology PhD program with an anticipated start date in
late August. Previous experience in molecular biology
and working with marine larvae and/or bioinformatics
is desirable. Additionally, the Meyer lab is interested
in creative, engaged applicants who can contribute to
diversity of the academic community, for example via
outreach to students from historically underrepresented
communities. The successful applicant will be guaran-
teed funding for ve years through a combination of
research assistantships and teaching assistantships.

PhD Position Available at ETH Zurich in the Plant
Pathology Group of the Institute of Integrative Biology
[in collaboration with the University of Neuch ^Atel]
Population Genomics of Plant Pathogenic Fungi
We seek applicants with interests and background knowl-
edge in the elds of Population Genomics, Evolutionary
Biology, Quantitative Genetics, Microbiology, Molecu-
lar Plant-Microbe Interactions, or Fungal Ecology to
conduct PhD research oriented around the population
genomics of plant pathogenic fungi. Applicants should
be able to work independently and to publish their re-
search in excellent peer-reviewed journals. Applicants
should have eective communication skills, both oral
and written.
Experience with fungi or plant pathogens is desirable,
though not required, but applicants who already have
experience with plant pathogens and fungi will have an
advantage. Experience with population and/or quanti-
tative genetics is also desirable. The applicant should
be interested in managing and analyzing extensive phe-
notype datasets containing millions of data points in ad-
dition to generating and analyzing new genome datasets
to complement the ~1000 genomes already available in
the laboratory.
Our major areas of research are population genetics and
genomics, evolutionary biology, evolutionary ecology, ex-perimental evolution, and phylogeography. Our primary
experimental organisms are the plant pathogenic fungi
Zymoseptoria tritici (aka Mycosphaerella graminicola),
Parastagonospora nodorum (aka Phaeosphaeria nodo-
rum), and Rhynchosporium commune (aka Rhynchospo-
rium secalis). Extensive genome sequence datasets are
already available for all three fungi, including multiple
nished reference genomes for Z. tritici and P. nodorum.
We have already acquired complete genome sequences
for globally distributed eld populations for all three
fungi ( ~200-1000 genomes). We have developed and
implemented high throughput phenotyping methods
oriented around automated image analysis to acquire
millions of phenotype data points for a variety of impor-
tant traits, including virulence, reproduction, fungicide
sensitivity, and growth at dierent temperatures and
under dierent stresses.
As a result of earlier projects centered around QTL
mapping, GWAS, RNA seq and population genomics,
we have identied many candidate genes that contribute
to virulence, fungicide resistance, thermal adaptation,
and host responses. Several of these genes have already
been functionally validated, with more functional val-
idations underway. The successful candidate will be
integrated into a research program that uses knowledge
obtained from these genomic and phenomic datasets to
understand trade-os among pathogen traits and iden-
tify new candidate genes that play important roles in
the evolutionary ecology of these pathogens.
The PhD project will also include an interaction com-
ponent with the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics
headed by Prof. Daniel Croll (http://www.pathogen-
genomics.org) for the analyses and interpretation of
genomic sequence datasets.
The ETH and the Institute of Integrative Biology possess
advanced infrastructure including the Genetic Diversity
Center (http://www.gdc.ethz.ch/) and the Functional
Genomics Center Zurich (http://www.fgcz.ethz.ch/).
Zurich is consistently rated as one of the most livable

Evaluating the animal welfare impacts of chronic noise
on livestock
Primary Supervisor: Dr Ed Harris, Crop & Environ-
mental Sciences Secondary supervisor: Professor Mark
Rutter External supervisors: Selvino De Kort, Sue-Anne
Zollinger PhD project title: Evaluating the animal wel-
fare impacts of chronic noise on livestock University of
Registration: Harper Adams University
The negative eects of exposure to chronic, low decibel
noise are known to impact humans and other animals,
increasing stress and associated physiological function
such as blood pressure, immune response and chromo-
somal telomere damage. For example, humans suer
under the eects of urban noise (1) and there is growing
evidence that farm animals and wildlife suer similar
impacts. The increase in terrestrial noise associated
with transport networks is a global phenomenon but
has had the greatest impacts in Europe and the United
States (2,3). As part of the European Commission en-
vironmental noise directive, the UK government has
policy in place to mitigate the growing impact of urban
noise on human health, but there is no specic policy at
present with respect to the impact of noise on biodiver-
sity. To that end, Defra recently commissioned a study
(4) that concluded that current data tentatively suggest
that noise likely has measurable, negative impacts on
non-human animals, but that information is lacking de-
tail about how, why and to what extent noise interferes
with animals behaviour, wellbeing and individual tness.
The increase in the human population and the concur-
rent increase in urban noise put considerable pressure on
animals. The main contributors to noise pollution are
recognised to be road, rail and air trac. In the UK the
motor vehicle trac volume increased tenfold between
1949 and 2013 (5), with similar increases in aviation and
rail activity and associated noise. Thus, it is crucial to
understand the impact of urban noise on animals, both
at an individual level and for populations.This project
aims to investigate specic impacts of noise pollution on
welfare, stress and productivity in agricultural livestock.
One objective will be to analyse the specic large-scale
eects of noise on livestock by identifying \noisy" and
\quiet" farms using the predictive noise map from the
Strategic Noise Mapping exercise in the UK. Terrestrial
noise will be ground-truthed and behavioural (measured
via haptic data loggers) and physiological (e.g. corticos-
teroid production) correlates of stress will be measuredFebruary 1, 2020 EvolDir 23
to evaluate the degree to which chronic anthropogenic
noise (arising from transport networks) directly impacts
livestock. Second, the perception of noise in livestock
will be measured using in-ear noise pressure sensors.
This will aim to distinguish the overlap between the
noise map that is measured in the environment, from
the actual perceived sound inside the ear. Finally, we
will evaluate evidence that chronic noise can negatively
impact telomeres, the protective region anking animal
chromosomes that are linked to senescence and ageing.
We will do this by measuring relative telomere length
in livestock of dierent ages using quantitative PCR (6)

and experimental approaches in order to characterize
the molecular underpinnings behind the establishment
of specialized symbioses in herbivorous beetles. Speci-
cally, we are interested in how symbionts are integrated
into their hosts' ^A developmental cycle, and the regula-
tory and physiological implications of long-term coevo-
lution between host and microbe. The ideal candidates
are expected to apply their expertise and interests in
molecular biology, ecology, genomics, proteomics and/or
microscopy to formulate hypothesis-driven research and
participate in collaborations with other members of the
group.
The laboratory is part of a collaborative environment
equipped with state-of-the art infrastructure and a
highly collegial community. With access to excellent core
facilities within the Institute for Developmental Biology
(including platforms for microscopy, proteomics, and
metabolomics, and sequencing and high-performance

AnnelidEvoDevo
The development of an entire animal from a single totipo-
tent cell 'V the zygote 'V is arguably one of the most
fascinating processes in Nature. Strikingly, how this
process is regulated at the lower levels of biological
complexity, such as at the level of the genome and its
regulation during the early phases of development, is
still poorly understood. Moreover, our understanding
relies on what is known for only a handful of species,
such as mammals and ies. To solve this major knowl-
edge gap, the Martin-Duran lab is establishing annelid
embryos as experimental systems to understand the ge-
nomic regulation of early animal development. Annelid
embryos are unique in that they exhibit interspecic
variation in the way the zygote gives rises to the major
progenitor cells during early cleavage. What are the
epigenetic mechanisms controlling annelid development?
How do these mechanisms generate variability among
species? How can annelid development inform us of the32 EvolDir February 1, 2020
fundamental principles of animal embryogenesis?
- In this project you will rigorously answer these ques-
tions combining state-of-the-art experimental and com-
putation approaches. - You will have access to large
genomic databases, and in-house live organisms to fuel
your investigation. - You will gain experience of develop-
mental biology and molecular techniques (gene expres-
sion analyses, epigenomics), bioinformatics (pipelines to
analyse ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and HiC), and statistics. -
You will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and
hypotheses.
This is an ERC-Starting Grant PhD funded position.
The student will become part of Queen Mary' ^As Doc-
toral College, which provides training and development
opportunities and nancial support for research. The
student will also have access to a Researcher Develop-
ment Programme designed to help recognise and develop
key skills and attributes needed to eectively manage
research, and to prepare and plan for the next stages of
their career.
Skills preferred In a multidisciplinary project like this,
candidates are unlikely to have a background in all dis-
ciplines involved. The most important qualication is
motivation, enthusiasm and that the project appeals
to you. However, previous computational experience
would be a plus. We can envisage strong candidates
coming through a variety of routes including:
- practical molecular biology - developmental and cell
biology - computational biology

HorizontalGeneTransfer
Horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of insects: a
genomic approach
*Background* Horizontal gene transfer has played amajor role in the evolution of bacteria, however, its
importance in animals is less clear. Recent evidence
suggests that insects have repeatedly acquired genes
from symbiotic bacteria that have provided them with
key adaptation that has led to their incredible success.
Examples of this include, the horizontal acquisition of
genes for lignocellulose digestion that has led to her-
bivory in beetles, and toxin encoding genes that may
underlie protection from natural enemies in aphids and
vinegar ies. However, it is currently unclear how com-
mon the horizontal transfer of symbiont genes is across
insect species, and in most cases whether the newly
acquired genes actually provide insects with adaptive
functions. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of
horizontal gene transfer in insects as the acquisition of
novel traits from microbes is transforming our view of
how arthropods evolve. This is of particular important
for insect pests as it may underlie their capacity to
colonise new environments and resist eorts to control
them.
The successful applicant will use several insect families
as models to rigorously test hypotheses on horizontal
gene transfer in the evolution of insects. This may in-
clude: using whole genome sequence data to explore
horizontally acquired genes involved in nutrition and
defence across phylogenetically diverse insect species;
investigating gene expression proles to determine gene
activity; and performing functional assays to reveal
whether horizontally acquired genes provide insects with
novel adaptive functions.
- You will have access to large genetic databases, in-
sect collections, in-house live organisms and cutting-
edge research facilities to fuel your investigation. -
You will gain experience in bioinformatics, compar-
ative/metagenomics, molecular/experimental biology,
and statistics (e.g. comparative phylogenetics). - You
will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and hy-
potheses. EligibilityApplications are are open to inter-
national students, as wells those in the EU and UK who
have been awarded, or expecting to be awarded, at an
upper-class bachelors degree, or equivalent qualication,

ticularly encouraged to apply.

(1) NERC QUADRAT DTP CASE: UNDERSTAND-
ING AND PREDICTING THE SUCCESS OF ALIEN
FRESHWATER FISH
DEADLINE: 29/1/2020
Overview:
Alien species, those introduced outside their native
range, are a major driver of environmental change that
may lead to the extinction of local biodiversity, alter
ecosystem services and cause huge economic damage.
With increasing global trade, the number of new alien
species is growing rapidly. Thus, identifying which
species may establish and become invasive is an ur-
gent global challenge. However, with no history of past
invasion, it is hard to predict which new alien species
will establish, and which ones will go naturally extinct.
Freshwater sh are among the most frequently intro-
duced vertebrates and many have major detrimental
eects on the most vulnerable ecosystems on Earth:
freshwater habitats. Surprisingly, we know remarkably
little of why some sh species are more likely to establish
and spread in novel regions, and which species are likely
to be the future successful aliens.
Aim:
To identify which species traits facilitate the introduc-
tion, establishment and spread of alien freshwater sh
and predict the probability of success of potential futureinvaders, at global and local scale.
Objectives:
1) To build a global scale database on freshwater sh
introductions, introduction pathways, and species traits;
2) To test which species characteristics determine the
probability of introduction, establishment and spread
of alien freshwater sh using the database, phylogenetic
comparative methods and theoretical modelling;
3) To produce a Horizon scanning output that informs
policy, by quantifying how dierent pathways to intro-
duction (e.g. angling, sheries, pet trade) inuence
the probability of release in novel regions, and deriving
their probability invasion at global and local scale for
species likely to be introduced globally and in the UK
and Ireland in particular.
There is also the possibility to carry out case studies in
the eld in Ireland, Argentina or Indonesia.

CASE: UNDERSTANDING THE ECOLOGY AND
COEVOLUTION OF APHIDS AND PARASITOIDS
DEADLINE: 06/03/2020
Parasitoids are insects that play a fundamental ecolog-
ical role in both natural and agricultural ecosystems
by regulating the population of hebivore pests, such as
aphids. Despite much work on the ecology and evolu-
tion of parasitoids, we still ignore to what extent the
demography of the enemy (the parasitoid) is adapted
to that of the host (the crop pest) and viceversa; how
the degree of specialisation of parasitoids to the host(s)
facilitates or undermines their population persistence
in the environment; whether more patchy and diverse
environments oer refugia points for parasitoids, and
how populations of pest hosts and their parasitoids will
respond to predicted climate change.The student will
address these fundamental questions using a powerful
combination of approaches. Specically, the student
will:
Derive general principles using phylogenetic comparative
methods by investigating questions at the global scale
across hundreds of parasitoid species and their hosts,
on (i) how dierent reproductive strategies evolved in
hosts and in parasitoids, and coevolved between them;
(ii) how the degree of host specialisation aects the
population dynamics in both hosts and parasitoids.
Run experiments with plants, pests and parasitoids to
investigate their response to predicted future climate
and extreme climatic events.34 EvolDir February 1, 2020
Run eld trials to investigate whether habitat patch-
iness supports parasitoid populations busing the
agri-environments and a cereal-aphid-parasitoid com-
plex as models in both natural and agri-environments.
The project is designed to oer the student the oppor-
tunity to expand or reduce the experimental and eld
components as best suited to their interests or as needed.

We are currently opening a PhD-position at Stockholm
University working with ' Gut microbiomes and plant-
host-parasitoid interactions'.
Description:
The general aim of the project is to study how the gut
microbiome aects the ecology and evolution of the host,
both host plant use and the ability to defend against
parasitic wasps, in a phylogenetic context. The PhD-
project aims to (i) sequence the gut microbiome to nd
dierences in microbiome community composition be-
tween host species, (ii) identify mechanisms whereby
the gut microbiome is transferred between generations
(mainly between adult and larvae), (iii) study how the
gene expression within the host depends on the micro-
biome community composition in relation to host plant
use and to defense mechanisms against parasitic wasp at-
tack. The project will involve a set of leaf beetle species,
their host plants and the parasitic wasps attack beetle
larvae. Within the project group, there is more than 20
years' experience in working with the system, including
a thorough understanding of the ecological and physi-
ological processes aecting species interactions as wellFebruary 1, 2020 EvolDir 37

StockholmU SexualSelection
PhD in Sexual Selection
A four year full time PhD position focused on sexual
selection is available in Professor Rhonda Snook's group
in the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University.
Snook's lab is generally interested in how sexual selection
inuences the rapid (co)evolution of male and female
reproductive traits, typically using Drosophila fruit ies.
The PhD project aims to improve understanding in this
area, and will involve laboratory based phenotyping of
male and female reproductive traits and quantitative
genetic analyses, with opportunities for experimental
and genomic work. While several research questions
are already available to pursue in the Snook lab in this
general area, the student will also have the opportunity
to contribute to development of the project. The ideal
candidate will have a strong background in evolution,
but training for both general and specic skills required
for the project will obviously be part of training in a
vibrant lab environment, with potential for interaction
with international collaborators. Working language in
the lab is English.
It is strongly recommended that you read relevant lit-
erature and tailor your cover letter and application
accordingly. Applications without this will not be con-
sidered. Start date is exible but ideally before October
2020. To be eligible you need a degree corresponding
to at least four years of higher education, including
an independent project at an advanced level in animal
ecology, evolutionary biology or similar subject (i.e. a
Master's degree or similar).
The Department of Zoology is a vibrant international
community, consisting of ve interactive and collabora-
tive divisions: Ecology, Ethology, Functional Morphol-
ogy, Population Genetics, and Systematics and Evolu-
tion. The advertised PhD will be part of the Division

MutationDrivenEvolution
Description of the oer: The Technical University of
Madrid is currently oering a fully funded PhD oppor-
tunity via La Caixa Foundation to investigate the role
of mutation bias as a force directing evolution. The
successful candidate will join an emerging team led by
Dr Couce at the Centre for Plant Biotechnology and
Genomics (CBGP), a mixed research centre supported
by the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and the
National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research
and Technology (INIA). The everyday working language
in the laboratory is English, and administrative tasks,
training and seminars arranged by the institute are con-
ducted in English. Being the third-largest metropolitan
area in the EU, Madrid is a vibrant, multicultural hub
with a high quality of life and a thriving cultural scene.
The position oers a highly competitive salary with
all the benets of the Spanish National Social Security
System, comprising generous sick/maternity/paternity
leaves and health, unemployment and retirement insur-
ances.
Background: The evolution of mutation rates has fas-
cinated evolutionary biologists for decades (Sniegowski
2000, Bioessays), and continues to be a major topic due
to the importance of elevated mutation rates in bacte-
rial infections (Bartell et al., Nat Comm 2019) and in
cancer (Campbell et al., Cell 2017). In addition, work
led by the host lab has shown that even short pulses of
hypermutability can leave deep and long-lasting signa-
tures in bacterial genomes, challenging previous views
on the evolution of bacterial genome size and compo-
sition (Couce et al., PNAS 2017). Even more recently,
work by the host lab has shown that dierent codon
usage patterns can alter the probability that a particu-
lar mutational spectrum generates strong-eect amino
acid changes, which implies that hypermutators might
display dierent evolutionary properties in species with
contrasting GC content (Couce et al., Nat Comm 2019).
Description of activities: In this project, you will follow
up on this work and provide a rst empirical account on
the role of mutation spectrum in the emergence and sub-
sequent evolution of hypermutability and stress-induced
mutagenesis in dierent species. Briey, you will con-
duct Mutation Accumulation Experiments (Halligan& Keightley, Annu Rev Ecol Evol 2009) to measure
the mutational load of dierent mutators in species
with contrasting GC content. These lineages will be
later subjected to experimental evolution for hundreds
of generations to quantify the costs of mutation ero-
sion in novel environments, and how readily these costs
can be overcome by de novo adaptation. In parallel,
you will characterise the mutational spectrum of stress-
induced polymerases from dierent species, for which
some dierences have been reported but not conclusively
established (Nohmi, Annu Rev Microbiol 2006). Finally,
you will conduct a survey among wild isolates of plant
and animal opportunistic pathogens to study the natu-
ral, within-species polymorphisms in mutation rate and
spectra.
How to apply: Interested candidates please send a sin-
gle PDF le with a cover letter and a short CV to Dr
Alejandro Couce (a.couce@upm.es). Please include the
word \MutDrivenEvolution" in the subject line. The
deadline for applications is Feb 1th and the anticipated
start date is Sep 2020 to Jan 2021.

lation studies with empirical analysis of wild-sampled
Arabis alpina. Field sampling in Italy and the Swiss
Alps is an aspect of this project, but prior experience
working with plants is not required
In general, I seek a student who is strongly motivated
to learn, ask questions, and think critically about topics
in evolutionary biology. Prior experience in bioinfor-
matics is a plus; top candidates will be those interested
and committed to working both on the computer and
in the wet lab. A Master' ^As degree in biology or a
related eld is a prerequisite for this position. Any sig-
nicant changes in research eld should be described
and explained in the applicant's motivation letter.
The Institute for Plant Sciences is a vibrant commu-
nity of evolutionary biologists, ecologists, and plant
physiologists, located within the beautiful Botanical
Gardens of Bern, the capital city of Switzerland. The
projects are funded by a Swiss National Science Foun-
dation (SNF) Ambizione grant to Dr. Kimberly
Gilbert, who will be the main supervisor, within the

UBristol AntDiseaseEvolution
PhD position in collective behaviour and social immu-
nity at the University of Bristol (UK)
A fully funded PhD position is available in the Ant Lab
headed by Dr Nathalie Stroeymeyt at the School of Bio-
logical Sciences, University of Bristol, UK, to investigate
the strategies used by ants to decrease epidemic risk in
environments with high pathogen pressure.
Background Group living oers favourable conditions
for the spread of infectious diseases, because high pop-
ulation densities and frequent social contacts facilitate
pathogen transmission. To mitigate that risk, social
animals have evolved a variety of defence mechanisms to
prevent the entry and propagation of pathogens within
the group, ranging from raised investment in personal
immunity to highly coordinated collective sanitary ac-
tions conferring social immunity. Recent studies have
shown that social groups can also adopt organisational
features, such as the subdivision into well-separated
subgroups, which reduce epidemic risk through trans-
mission bottleneck eects. However, the importance of
such organisational immunity features in disease risk
management by real animal groups is still poorly un-
derstood. Research in our group adopts an empirical
approach based on the experimental manipulations of
garden ant colonies (Lasius niger) to (i) quantify the
eect of social organisation on disease transmission and
test key predictions from network epidemiology, and
(ii) evaluate the relative of importance of personal im-February 1, 2020 EvolDir 41
munity, collective sanitary actions and organisational
features under dierent environmental conditions and
at dierent stages of development (for more detail see
https://stroeymeyt-lab.ch/research).
The project The goal of this PhD project will be to un-
derstand how ant colonies adjust dierent components
of their disease defences (personal immunity, collective
sanitary actions and transmission-inhibiting social or-
ganisation) in response to repeated disease challenges.
The project will involve a combination of controlled
pathogen inoculations, behavioural experiments (auto-
mated tracking of individually marked ants), molecular
work (physiological assays and immune gene expression
analysis), and computational analyses of tracking data
(social network analyses and simulations). The project
will aim to elucidate whether ants use changes in spatial
and social organisation as an active strategy to decrease
epidemic risk.
Desired prole We are looking for candidates with ex-

UCentralFlorida AntParasites
PhD position in Integrative and Conservation biology at
the University of Central Florida (Orlando, FL, USA)
As part of our NSF CAREER project (Award Number
1941546), we have a fully funded PhD position available
in the Parasitic Behavioral Manipulation Lab headed
by Dr Charissa de Bekker in the Department of Biol-
ogy at the University of Central Florida, to investigate
the molecular mechanisms that fungal parasites use to
manipulate ant behavior.
Background Information Infected animals generally be-
have dierently from healthy animals. These changes
can go beyond mere sickness behaviors to reect pre-
cise manipulations induced by parasites to increase that
parasite's chances to spread. How manipulative para-
sites can alter host behavior is currently unknown. The
behaviorally tractable \zombie ant system" has the po-
tential to expose the mechanisms underlying parasitic
behavioral manipulation and fundamentally transform
perceptions of parasite-host interactions and their be-
havioral ecology eects. Our lab uses these fungus-
infected \zombie ants" as a model to systematically
quantify disease progression and accompanying behav-
ioral phenotypes, to determine where sickness behavior
ends, where manipulation begins, and which intricate
molecular mechanisms are involved.
What would you be working on? The goal of this PhD
project will be to better understand 1) how ant be-
havior changes throughout infection; 2) how ant and
fungal tissues interact throughout this progression; 3)
reveal which genes and pathways from both parasite42 EvolDir February 1, 2020
and host give rise to behavioral phenotypes; and 4) elu-
cidate the functions of these genes and pathways. The
work that the PhD researcher will perform will span the
integration of multiple technological approaches to un-
derstand how zombie-making fungi of the genus Ophio-
cordyceps interact with ants; from the molecular level
to the behavioral output displayed by the whole organ-
ism. The integrative research activities of this project
will prepare them for an increasingly cross-disciplinary
STEM job market. Moreover, the project will lever-
age the public's interest in zombie-making parasites to
create immersive pedagogies for teaching biology to a
diverse student population. As such, the PhD inves-
tigator will also be involved in the development of a
research-based, educational virtual reality experience
about microbial infections and insects that we plan to
take to K-12 schools, museums and fairs. For more
detailed information about the project, please visit the
NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-

Who are we looking for? We are looking for motivated
candidates who would be eager to perform integrative
research that spans multiple disciplines within the broad
eld of biology. To be considered for this PhD position,
candidates should have a strong interest in either (or al)l
of the following: the molecular workings of parasite-host
interactions and parasitic manipulations, ant behavior,
and/or fungal biology. Having experience in live in-
sect husbandry, quantitative behavioral analyses and
programming (i.e., behavioral tracking and coding to
analyze data) or molecular microbiology (e.g., CRISPR-
Cas technology, cloning techniques, fungal culturing and
transformation) will be considered a big plus. Already
having a master's degree is also perceived as favorable,
together with a good working knowledge in statistics
and experimental design. It is desirable that candidates
are passionate about science, creative, motivated to par-
ticipate in scientic outreach and have excellent oral
and written communication skills. Candidates will also
need to be able to work both independently and as part
of a team.
The PhD position The position will be part of an NSF
CAREER project team consisting of two PhD students
and several undergraduate students. Because of the
collaborative nature of our lab, the candidate will also
be working with a post-doctoral scholar and a PhD stu-
dent who work on closely related projects. The position
will be fully funded for 4 years such that the candidate
will receive a maintenance stipend, tuition fees will be
covered and travel to two conferences per year will be
covered.

PaleoEnvironmentalDNA
PhD position on past anthropogenic impacts using sedi-
mentary ancient DNA -
Analyses of past climate and anthropogenic impact on
Lake Constance biota using sedimentary ancient DNA
Topic/Questions: The project will investigate sediment
core DNA from Lake Constance, reaching back multiple
millenia. Lake Constance has a rich archaeological and
historical record of human occupation reaching back
through times of variable climate. During the 20th
century it furthermore experienced a documented pe-
riod of anthropogenic eutrophication and subsequent
re-oligotrophication. The lake therefore lends itself as a
great model to study the relative eects of human im-
pact and climatic changes on lake ecosystems throughout
the last millenia. We will address the following ques-
tions: 1) How stable was the lacustrine ecosystem in
preceding centuries compared to the 20th century, and
have patterns of response, resilience and reversibility
changed in the \Anthropocene"? 2) Were earlier pe-
riods of change in lacustrine community composition
related to changes in terrestrial ecosystems and human
presence? 3) Were these changes driven by human land
use or by climate? The PhD will be conducted within
the Research Training Group R3 - Resilience of Lake
Ecosystems. Within the Research Training Group R3, a
diverse group of doctoral researchers is investigating the
response of community structure, biological interactions
and carbon and nutrient ows to changing conditions
in Lake Constance. This is a great and collaborative
environment to conduct a PhD! More information can
be found at https://www.rtg-resilience.uni-konstanz.de
Work: The doctoral researcher will analyze DNA ex-
tracted from dated sediment cores of Lake Constance
and retrieve detailed information on a variety of aquatic
and terrestrial organisms, with a focus on indicators
of human impact (cultivated plants, livestock, aquatic
indicators of eutrophication). The work will comprise
DNA extraction, metabarcoding techniques as well as
non-PCR based approaches to obtain NGS sequencing
data. Biotic records will be compared to archaeologicaland historical records, as well as existing paleoclimate
records of the area.
PIs: Laura Epp, Mark van Kleunen & David Schleheck
Requirements: Master in a relevant subject (Biology,
Ecology, .), a keen interest in the research questions
addressed as well as interest in interdisciplinary, collabo-
rative science. An ideal candidate would have experience
with next generation sequencing data acquisition and
analysis, and/or statistical data analyses, and/or pale-
oecological work. Experience with environmental DNA
and/or ancient DNA are an asset, but not a prerequisite
to apply.
All applications and supporting materials (motivation

coevolve in an evolutionary arms race and for which we
recently obtained the genomes. We will use populations
of a \natural experiment", in which host and parasite
evolve in sympatry (=coevolve) or allopatry. The aim
of this study is to identify genomic signatures of this
coevolutionary arms race and to functionally validate
candidate genes playing a role in the reciprocal host-
parasite co-adaptation. For these goals, we will use a
suit of dierent techniques such as behavioral assays,
cuticular hydrocarbon proling (GCMS), transcriptome
analyses (RNA-seq), population genomics (Pool-seq, in-
dividual genome resequencing) and gene knockdown
(dsRNAi).
We are looking for two highly motivated candidates with
an MSc degree (or equivalent) in Biology, Bioinformatics
or related elds. The successful applicant should have a
strong background in evolutionary biology, population
genetics, behavioral ecology and / or bioinformatics.

not a must. The working language of our laboratories
is English. The University of Mainz / the Senckenberg
Bik-F Institute aim to increase the number of women in
science, and applications by women are strongly encour-
aged. Similarly, qualied candidates with disabilities
will be preferred.
Successful applicants will join an international

UNeuchatel EvolutionaryBotany
A four-year PhD position combining ecology and evo-

Neuch^ atel, Switzerland. The thesis is nanced by the
Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) within the
framework of a Sinergia project. It is directed by Prof.
Jason Grant (UniNe) and co-supervised by Dr. Pierre-
Emmanuel Du Pasquier (UniNe) and Dr. Beryl LaitungFebruary 1, 2020 EvolDir 47
(Universit e de Bourgogne, UMR Agro ecologie, Dijon,
France).
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Anthropic pres-
sure may lead to the rapid and sometimes irreversible
decline of botanical diversity, or on the contrary, favors
the expansion of certain non-native species. In Europe,
since the mid-20th century, the intensication and mod-
ernization of agricultural practices (mechanization with
deep ploughing, use of herbicides, seed sorting, densi-
cation of monocultures and systematic use of certied
seeds) has had an unprecedented impact on archaeo-
phyte messicole species (crop-related species that were
introduced mainly from the Middle East before the year
1500). As messicole species are generally therophytes
(annual plants that spend the dicult season in the form
of seeds), modernization quickly destroys seed stocks
in the soil and contributes to the decline of these popu-
lations that were common until the mid-20th century.
Although messicolous species are part of the oristic
richness of the dierent countries where they are now
native, they seem to have been introduced in the past by
man in the form of seed since the domestication of crops
from the Neolithic period (11000 to 9000 years ago).
Some species introduced secondarily and recently into
new regions may be locally abundant and may pass from
archaeophyte to neophyte status: this is the case, for
example, of the cornower (Centaurea cyanus or Cyanus
segetum), introduced into North America from Europe.
The main goal of this PhD is to study the population
dynamics of dierent archaeophyte messicole taxa with
varied population dynamics using functional ecology
(life history trait analysis) and evolutionary botany (ge-
netic analysis of evolutionary history) approaches. From
herbarium collections, we plan to recreate populations
from the 18th century to the present from which genetic
analysis and mapping will be carried out. Experiments
will be done in the eld (experimental station in Di-
jon) in order to analyze current populations. Fieldwork
is necessary to sample populations and establish the
current status and future of the taxa.
REQUIREMENTS The successful candidate holds a
master's degree in ecology, evolutionary biology or an
equivalent eld with an excellent academic record. A
strong interest in ecology, evolutionary genetics and a
good knowledge of botany is desirable. Periods of work
in experimental elds, in the laboratory, in herbaria and
in the eld are an integral part of this thesis.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND DEADLINE The
candidate should send a single PDF le by e-mail con-
taining 1) a letter of motivation describing research
interests, willingness to do a PhD, and suitability for
this subject, 2) a curriculum vitae, 3) a copy of master's
degree and transcript, 4) a summary of the master's the-sis, and 5) the names and contacts of two referees. The
application le should be sent to both Prof. Jason Grant
(jason.grant@unine.ch) and Dr. Pierre-Emmanuel Du
Pasquier (pierre-emmanuel.dupasquier@unine.ch). The
deadline is Monday, January 20, 2020.

SexDetermination
PhD position in Evolutionary Genomics, Uppsala Uni-
versity.
A PhD position is available in the research group of
Sophie Karrenberg at the Evolutionary Biology Cen-
tre in Uppsala, Sweden. We investigate the ecological
genomics of speciation and adaptation in plants.
The environment. The Evolutionary Biology Centre
(http://www.ebc.uu.se/) is one of the world's leading
research institutions in evolutionary biology. It is part
of Uppsala University considered one of Europe's lead-
ing universities in the subject of biology with a broad
variety of disciplines. The scientic environment with
numerous seminars, journal clubs and social activities of-
fer excellent possibilities for contacts and collaborations.
Our lab is part of the Department of Ecology and Genet-
ics and of the program in Plant Ecology and Evolution
(http://www.ieg.uu.se/), an active environment address-
ing fundamental evolutionary and ecological questions
with a wide range of dierent approaches. We are sit-
uated in the student town of Uppsala that oers rich
opportunities in cultural and outdoor activities. Swe-
den's capital, Stockholm, is less than an hour's train
ride away.
Project description: The evolution of separate sexes is
of fundamental importance in biology. Sex-determining
mechanisms are highly variable and labile and sex chro-
mosomes often degenerate; however, the underlying evo-
lutionary mechanisms are unclear. Theoretical studies
predict that sex chromosome evolution is driven by sex
ratio selection and/or by dierent forms of genetic con-
ict, for example, between males and females or between
cytoplasm and nucleus. Empirical evidence for these
predictions is scarce, in part because the best-studied
systems are animals with ancient and degenerate sex
chromosomes. The overarching aim of this project is to
contribute to the understanding of sex determination
and sex chromosome evolution by closing this gap be-February 1, 2020 EvolDir 51
tween theory and empirical studies. In this project, we
use a plant genus, Salix, with a high turnover of nascent
sex chromosomes. Strong sex ratio bias in crosses and
in natural populations and in crosses is common in Salix
suggesting that sexual antagonism or some other form
of genetic conict operates in this system. The project
has three main aims: (1) to identify the mechanisms
determining sex and sex ratio bias in Salix herbacea, (2)
to analyze the extent of degeneration and signs of selec-
tion in sex-associated region(s) and (3) to study possible
turnover events of genomic regions associated with sex
and/or sex ratio. We will combine whole-genome assem-
bly and individual re-sequencing with allele transmission
analysis of at loci with sex-associated polymorphisms in
controlled crosses and with population genomic analyses
and theoretical modeling. This comprehensive approach
will allow us to gain novel insights into sex chromosome
evolution and evolutionary processes at large.
The project will be conducted under the supervision
of Sophie Karrenberg, Uppsala University (main su-
pervisor) and P ar Ingvarsson (SLU Uppsala, second
supervisor).

PrimateSpeciationPopGen
A PhD student position in Primate Speciation and Pop-
ulation Genomics is available in the group of Katerina
Guschanski at the Department of Ecology and Genet-
ics, Uppsala University, Sweden. For more information
about the department see www.ieg.uu.se . Project de-
scription: Our group is broadly interested in under-
standing how long-term evolutionary and short-term
human-mediated processes shape biological diversity.
The advertised project has the goal to study primate
evolution from multiple angles and on dierent evolu-
tionary time scales. You will have the chance to study
population and species level processes in a number of
primate taxa using newly generated and publically avail-
able genomic data. Research topics include, but are not
limited to:
i) Speciation genomics and the role of ancient hybridiza-
tion in driving species diversity. You will focus on a
group of highly diverse African monkeys (guenons) that
are renown for their ecological, morphological and kary-
otypic diversity and readily hybridize in captivity and
the wild. Although the main focus will be on speciation
genomics, there are possibilities to extend this project
to include cytogenomics, morphological and ecological
analyses, depending on the candidate's interests.
ii) Population and conservation genomics. Using target
DNA capture from fecal samples you will study genetic
diversity, population structure, demography and local
adaptation in wild primate populations. The gener-
ated insights will have direct relevance for conservation
decision-making.
The exact project will be developed with the successful
candidate and tailored towards their interests and skills.
Duties: The selected candidate will mainly engage in
large-scale phylogenomic and population genomic analy-
ses that require solid bioinformatics skills, but will also
conduct work in the wet lab to produce genomic se-
quencing data from non-invasively collected low-quality
samples. Duties include active participation in the re-
search group activities, training of junior group members
in relevant techniques and engagement in collaborative
projects.
Qualications required: To be eligible for a PhD-student
position the applicant must hold a master degree (or52 EvolDir February 1, 2020
equivalent) in evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, or
a related eld. The technical skills of the candidates
will be evaluated based on the experience with large-
scale sequence analysis, bioinformatics prociency and
experience with phylogenomic and population genomic
studies. The ideal candidate will have a strong inter-
est and documented knowledge in evolutionary biology,
with a drive to understand processes shaping species
diversity. Perseverance and high intrinsic motivation are
required to work on non-model organisms using dicult
samples and data. You will be highly reliable, driven
and well-organized, curious and willing to think outside
the box, with the ability to quickly acquire new skills.
Prociency in spoken and written English is required.
Qualications desired: Previous experience with wet lab
molecular techniques, ideally with low-quality samples,
is highly desired.
Starting date: As early as possible, ideally by 2020-04-01
or as otherwise agreed.
Position: The graduate program covers four years of
full-time study. The position can be combined with
teaching or other duties at the department (maximum
20%), which prolongs the employment with the corre-
sponding time.
How to apply: The application should include 1) a cover
letter describing your research interests, your prociency
with molecular laboratory techniques and programming,
experience in handling genomic data, other technical
skills relevant for the project, as well as other qualica-
tions that make you a suitable candidate, 2) your CV,
including any produced publications, 3) a copy of your
master degree, your course grades and a copy of your

* PhD position available to study plant plasticity and lo-
cal adaptation to new pollinators after range expansion
at the University of Sussex, UK * (reminder)
Supervisor: Maria Clara Castellanos (http://-
www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/plant-evolutionary-ecology-
lab)
I am looking for an enthusiastic student interested in
plant-pollinator interactions and evolutionary biology.
The PhD project will focus on how plants can rapidly
adapt to new pollinator environments. Our work with
a developing study system in recently colonised envi-
ronments (Digitalis purpurea, the common foxglove)
shows that oral morphology can change in a few gen-
erations under new pollinators (including dierent bees
and hummingbirds in tropical mountains) but we still
know relatively little about how this occurs. The project
will use this exciting model system to examine how
adaptation to new pollination environments takes place,
and in particular, the potential role of phenotypic plas-
ticity in the process. We will use a combination of
approaches that include: 1) experimentally testing for
local adaptation using translocation experiments in the
eld, 2) measuring plastic variation in oral traits in the
greenhouse using quantitative genetics, 3) measuring
pollinator -mediated selection on oral traits, including
male components of tness using novel techniques to
track pollen grains. There will be scope for developing
further new ideas within this system.
This 3.5-years fully funded studentship is open to UK
and EU citizens. The project will have a signicant
eld component in the UK and abroad (e.g. South and
Central America), so it is essential that applicants are
committed and available to spend time in the eld. For
eldwork in the UK and abroad, a driving licence and
driving experience are essential. Experience with plant
growing and some knowledge of Spanish are a plus.

PhylogeneticComparativeInsects
PhD position: comparative phylogenetic studies on in-
sect body size
We are looking for a PhD student to perform part of
a larger, lab wide project entitled: \Comparative stud-
ies on insects: a focus on body size" nanced by Es-
tonian Research Council (2020-2024) and carried out
at Estonia's leading research centre: the University of
Tartu (https://www.ut.ee/en). The lab wide project
focuses on reconstructing moth phylogenies on the basis
of DNA sequences and performing various analyses of
trait evolution on the basis of these novel phylogenies.
The PhD thesis work advertised here will concentrate
on body size specically, and we propose that the stu-
dent will address questions such as associations between
body size and environment, macroevolutionary trends
in body size, and inferring constraints on body size.
Body size is perhaps the most obvious trait of any or-
ganism but the drivers of the evolution of size are far
from being understood, especially in insects in which
case the universal positive relationship between body
size and fecundity would lead to the prediction of a
permanent evolutionary increase in size. Most recently,
data and methods have started to become available to
nd out if such increase has actually occurred in the
course of evolution, and which factors have set limitsto it. The PhD student will primarily be running com-
parative analyses on pre-existing phylogenetic trees (e.g.
using R packages such as OUwie and BAMMtools) and
will also participate in data collection (incl. examin-
ing museum specimens). The work will be supervised
by Prof. Toomas Tammaru (http://kodu.ut.ee/ ~tam-
marut) and Dr. John Clarke (http://bit.ly/2qimTCy).
The group has a solid background in evolutionary ecol-
ogy of insects, phylogenetic analyses and taxonomy of
Lepidoptera, as well as collaboration ties with various
universities in Europe (e.g. potential to collaborate
with Niklas Wahlberg at Lund University, and Sebas-
tian H ohna at LMU Munich) and North America. PhD
studies in Estonia last for 4 years and publishing re-
search papers is a requirement; PhD students receive
competitive scholarships allowing them to work on their
thesis full time (alongside taking some relevant classes).
A successful candidate will have an excellent academic
record, experience with statistical analyses and inter-
est in evolutionary biology. Some experience and/or
genuine interest in the ecology/evolution/taxonomy of
insects as well as previous experience with phylogenetic
comparative methods is an advantage. The candidate
should have their master's degree by August 01, 2020
(if you are due to complete in September 2020, still
contact us, we may be able to nd a solution); the enrol-
ment as a PhD student will be from September 01, 2020.
If you are considering applying, please e-mail Toomas
Tammaru (toomas.tammaru@ut.ee) before the end of
February 10 (any time zone). Open to applicants from
all nations.

Vienna ThermalAdaptation
PhD position Dissecting the genetic basis of co-selected
traits during thermal adaptation Principal advisors:
Neda Barghi and Christian Schlotterer Institute of Pop-
ulation Genetics, Vetmeduni, Vienna, Austria
Background Both temperature mean and temperature
uctuations have important roles in thermal adaptation.
Recent studies suggest that adaptation to mean temper-
ature and uctuation in temperature are distinct traits
but their genetic basis and distinct eects of these selec-
tive pressures, i.e. constant and uctuating temperature,
on thermal adaptation are still largely unknown.
Aim This project aims to characterize genomic regions
involved in thermal adaptation and to dissect the genes
responsible for adaptation to either higher mean tem-February 1, 2020 EvolDir 55
perature or uctuating temperature. This work will
take advantage of 30 replicates of Drosophila simulans
evolved for over 100 generations in two temperature
regimes (constant 23 ^AoC and uctuating between 18
and 28 ^AoC).
Task You will have the opportunity to investigate two
traits, i.e. adaptation to mean temperature and uctua-
tion in temperature, by combining time series Pool-Seq
data, gene expression proling and phenotypic assays.
Preferred skills - Background in experimental or com-
putational elds such as bioinformatics, evolutionary
genetics, or experimental population genetics - Expe-
rience in programming (Python/R) - Good oral and
written communication skills
Why do your PhD with us? We oer - 1 month intensive
course in population genetics - Weekly seminar series

We are looking for an enthusiastic and motivated PhD
candidate with a keen interest in evolutionary biology56 EvolDir February 1, 2020
and genetics and/or medical microbiology/mycology.
You will work in a project that addresses the One-Health
consequences of circularity through the resistance de-
velopment to environmental and medical azoles in the
fungus Aspergillus fumigatus in accumulated organic
residues. The objectives are to (i) use the diversity of
organic waste disposal in the bulb growing sector to
discern the key factors driving resistance development,
(ii) use these factors to draw up an intervention plan
that will be tested in the laboratory and on-site, and (iii)
extend the obtained knowledge to general organic waste
disposal to assess resistance, transmission routes and
health risk across the system. Throughout, patient-risk
will be monitored via local, regional, and national spore-
trapping as well as patient isolates through hospital
surveillance. The project is expected to deliver a quanti-
tative and qualitative One-Health risk-assessment for the
pressing problem of rapidly spreading azole-resistance
world-wide.
The project has been recently awarded to the Laboratory
of Genetics (Wageningen) and the Radboud University
Medical Center (Nijmegen) by the Dutch funding orga-
nization NWO (see https://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-
events/news/2019/12/three-awards-for-groundbreaking-
research-in-agriculture-and-horticulture.html, and
full application available on request). The project
contains a Postdoc and technician position, and this
PhD position. Thus, you will be working in this teamwith clear own responsibility and ample intellectual
freedom to pursue the various biological aspects of azole
resistance. Moreover, the consortium contains a variety
of relevant stakeholders (e.g. from the bulb sector,
waste disposal and composting companies, the chemical
sector, and several governmental organizations) with
which you will interact during for instance progress
meetings.
WE ASK:
Our ideal candidate,
- is highly motivated and enjoys working in a team with
the Postdoc, technician, and the supervisors;
- has a strong background in evolutionary biology and
genetics. Some experience with handling large (genomic)
datasets and bioinformatics will be a bonus;
- likes the combination of eld and on-site sampling
in combination with state-of-the-art laboratory experi-
ments and analyses;
- is procient in the English language, is good in com-
munication, and enjoys working in a team.

2YrVisitingProf
Dear fellow evolutionary biologists{
Please see the job posting below for a 2 year visiting
professor position at Reed College. Although it does
not explicitly list 'evolutionary biology' as a focus inthe ad, I am on the search committee and evolutionary
questions/foci are most welcome (e.g., climate change
biologists, folks studying specic ecological adaptations,
folks looking at urban ecology/invasive species evolution
and ecology, etc. come to mind as some examples of
research programs that would be highly competitive in
this search). Many of us in the department are tack-
ling evolutionary questions, whether related to animal
behavior shifts, evolution of pathogenicity, or ower
color evolution. Note{ Reed is a special place. While it
is a 4 year primarily undergraduate institution, it has
a very strong emphasis (and a lot of support for) re-
search. Most of the faculty in our department have one
or more multi-year NSF or NIH grants supporting our
research, to give you an idea of the intellectual/scholarly
environment. Plus, it's in Portland!
If you have further questions, please check out the link
and email me, or the search chair. All best, Sarah
Schaack

(NOTE: We also advertise one postdoc position for
two years and unpaid volunteer positions for 2-12
months. See other advertisements or ask via email
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr)
We are looking for an extremely motivated and inde-
pendent biology student with a master's degree to join
the striped mouse project as soon as possible as station
manager and a second student to start in July 2020 as
research manager. Both managers are expected to stay
until at last end of October 2021 while an extension
for up to 3 years is possible. This position is suitable
for somebody who would like to gain experience in eld
work and scientic management. Managers get free
accommodation at the station and a compensation to
cover their daily costs starting at R4000 for the rst
three months, rising to R5000 per month and more af-
terwards, which is sucient to pay all costs of living
(approx. 3500/month). Travel costs can be refunded
by up to an additional R 16 000 / year. As such, the
position compensates for all arising costs but does not
represent a legal employment.
The station manager and the research manager work
closely together and both managers share many respon-
sibilities. However, each will have specic main duties,
but should also be able to deal with all other duties (for
example when the other manager is on leave, or when a
new manager has to be trained). The new manager will
be instructed by the present managers, with which theywill overlap for several months.
You must be hard-working, highly motivated, able to
work independently, good in communicating with peo-
ple, able to supervise others, and not afraid of snakes.
You must have a drivers licence and you must love to
live at a remote place in nature, without regular internet
and cell-phone reception. Most importantly, you are
fascinated by nature and science!
Skills needed: Good experience in eld work and good
knowledge of behavioural ecology or a similar eld of
research. Experiences in working with small mammals,
radio-tracking, blood sampling, and living at a remote
location are of advantage. Handyman skills are of ad-
vantage and needed for the station manager position.
Great opportunity: This is a great opportunity to spend
1.5-3 years in Africa, acquiring important skills in eld
biology and project management, while improving your
CV. These skills will become valuable whether you later
continue with a PhD or other jobs. It will be very hard
and demanding, but also a once in a life time experience!
Job description: Five working days a week (Mo, Tue,
Thu, Fr, Sat), with Wednesday being used for a shop-
ping trip to town (not counted as working day) and
Sundays being free. Included are four weeks of holiday
for 12 months, which has to be taken outside the main
breeding season (so not during August to November)
and during periods when the other manager is present
at the research station (the two managers cannot be on
leave at the same time).

FieldAssistant BirdEvol
Expenses paid eld assistant positions to study the
breeding ecology of blue tits and collared ycatchers on
the wonderful island of Gotland.
For the upcoming eld season (20 April-20/30 June
2020) we are looking for an expenses-paid eld assis-
tant to join the team working on the Swedish island
of Gotland. It is a famous bird study site, with over
40 years of bird ecology monitoring, and additionally
an amazingly beautiful and unique location for all bird
lovers, a major birding and bird migration hotspot, and
a culturally rich location for all Scandinavia lovers.
Our current project concerns two species: the blue tit
and the collared ycatcher. Apart from general mon-
itoring of both species' breeding we conduct specic
research, which now concentrates on colour biology and
expression in the blue tit. The work is demanding, re-
quiring long hours spent in the forest in variable weather
conditions (although the weather has been very gentlethe past few seasons on Gotland), precision in handling
the birds and recording the data, and the ability to
work in a team. The team will consist of 7-11 assistants,
plus an additional collaborating team of similar size
from France, staying in another location close by. Basic
procedures used during eldwork involve catching adult
birds with mist-nets, ringing of adults and nestlings,
morphological measurements of young and adult birds,
blood-sampling od some birds for genetic analyses. We
provide training on the most crucial procedures, but a
basic knowledge of bird morphology and bird handling
exp erience is more than welcome.
Qualications: (1) BSc/MSc in Biology, Ecology, Evolu-
tion or similar qualication (2) Previous eld experience
will be a big plus (3) Ability to work in small teams and
sociable personality (4) Bird ringing and mist-netting
experience is desired but can also be learned on site (5)
EU-valid driving licence (6) Fluent in English
We will cover for the accommodation (lodging in rooms
shared with other eld assistants - usually 2 persons per
room - in a beautiful & comfortable, large house in the
middle of the eldwork area), travel expenses from and
to the|study site (within reasonable limits and up to
450 EUR; if more is expected - let's discuss possibilities
on a case by case basis), as well as the living expenses.
Applications - including a CV, a letter of motivation
(1/2 A4 page) and the name of two referees - should be
send to Szymon Drobniak szymek.drobniak@gmail.com,
ideally as a single PDF le.
Full consideration will be given to applications received
until the 15th of February. After that date applications
will be monitored if any additional assistants would be
required. Applications sent after the 20 of March will
not be considered.
Please do not hesitate to write to me if you have more
and specic questions.

major elephant and pangolin poaching hotspots across
Africa over time. We also use these data to link transna-
tional criminal organizations to multiple large ivory
shipments based on direct and familial sample match-
ing. Our main wildlife monitoring programs examine:
(a) impacts of wolf recovery on the distributions, di-
ets, microbiome and physiological health of sympatric
predators and prey in Washington state and (b) im-

DelawareStateU SummerInternship
EvolutionaryNeuroscience
The Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research is of-
fering a summer research opportunity for undergradu-
ate students who are interested in a career related to
neuroscience research, and opportunities exist to study
evolutionary neuroscience.
Students will spend 10 weeks over the summer carrying
out neuroscience research with researchers at Delaware
State University and the University of Delaware. The
students, accompanied by their mentors, will also have
the opportunity to travel to present their research at a
regional or national conference.
Students accepted to the program will choose a fac-
ulty research mentor and will spend approximately 35
hours/week working in their mentor's laboratory. Stu-
dents will also participate in career, academic and pro-
fessional development activities. Participants in the
program will receive a stipend of $4,000 over the sum-
mer and will be eligible for additional travel support
over the following academic year. Housing is available
at Delaware State University for participants who need
it. The program is open to undergraduate students
who are US citizens or permanent residents or who have
DACA status. Students must have completed at least 25
credits of college-level work, and will not receive a Bach-
elor's degree before December 2020. Students can be of
any major as long as they have an interest and career
plans related to neuroscience. Students in the program
can work on projects on evolutionary neuroscience, as
well as other topics in Neuroscience (e.g., the mecha-
nisms of Alzheimer's disease, ALS, autism, fetal alcohol
syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, anxiety, epilepsy,
Parkinson's disease, PTSD). If you are interested in op-
portunities in evolutionary neuroscience, contact Chris-
tine Charvet at ccharvet@desu.edu and/or specify Dr.
Charvet as your mentor. The deadline is March 16, 2020;

FrogColorEvolution
The Summers lab at East Carolina University is search-
ing for an undergraduate student research participant to
train and learn how to carry out research associated with
a National Science Foundation (NSF REU) supported
project focused on the genetic underpinnings of mimicry
and color pattern evolution in a mimetic radiation of
poison frogs in north central Peru (see description be-
low), in the summer of 2020 (May 'V August). Desirable
qualications for this position include an interest in the
ecology and evolutionary biology of tropical amphibians,
coursework or experience in evolutionary biology and
tropical ecology, and previous work with live animals
(especially amphibians). The position will involve as-
sisting graduate students on specic projects, and also
learning how to gather data for a project they student
take the lead on. This intensive eld research training
assistantship will be funded by a National Science Foun-
dation Research Experience for Undergraduates award,
and will provide funds for travel, living expenses, eld
supplies, and a stipend for three months. Fieldwork will
involve long, hard days working under dicult condi-
tions (heat, humidity, insects), and will require careful
planning and perseverance. Knowledge of Spanish will
be helpful for this work. The successful applicant will
receive training in tropical biology and eldwork in the
rainforest, and will receive authorship on presentations
and manuscripts to which she/he has made a substan-
tial contribution. The trainee will submit a report and
presentation after the research period that will describe
how she/he has learned to approach these methods and
concepts and how this has shaped his/her knowledge.
Project Description: The evolution of color pattern di-
versity in the context of mimicry has been a focus of
theoretical and empirical attention, yet knowledge of
the genetic basis of this diversity remains limited. This
research project combines three research groups with
complementary skills and realms of expertise to investi-
gate the genetic basis and population genomic processes
underlying color pattern divergence in the context of
mimicry in the Peruvian mimic poison frog, Ranitomeya
imitator: Dr. Kyle Summers (East Carolina University),
Dr. Rasmus Nielsen (UC Berkeley) and Dr. Matthew
MacManes (University of New Hampshire). The project
focuses on four specic aims: 1. Identify key genetic
factors involved in color pattern development in R. imi-February 1, 2020 EvolDir 77
tator by investigating dierential gene expression across
developmental stages and color pattern morphs, in the
eld and in the laboratory. 2. Identify the causal gene(s)
underlying dierences in color pattern between morphs
using genome-wide marker arrays (exome capture se-
quences) to screen transition zone samples and enable
admixture mapping. 3. Test the association of specic
candidate loci with color pattern using pedigree analyses
of candidate genes identied from Aims 1 and 2, using
a multigenerational pedigree. 4. Test specic hypothe-
ses regarding selection and demographic processes in
the transition zones and between mimics and models.
Together these complementary, mutually reinforcing ap-
proaches will begin to reveal the genetic underpinnings
and population genomics of color pattern diversity in
this mimetic radiation of poison frogs.
The Department of Biology at ECU is large and multidis-
ciplinary, with strong research groups in evolution, ecol-
ogy, behavior and genomics: see www.ecu.edu/biology
for more information. See http://blog.ecu.edu/sites/-

Volunteer (with expenses paid) eld assistant position
to study breeding ecology in the long-tailed nch hybrid
zone in the Kimberley Region of Australia, March-June
2020
I am looking for an expenses-paid eld assistant for
the upcoming eld season (March-June 2020) for my
PhD project studying breeding behaviour of long-tailed
nches in their genetic hybrid zone. The Kimberley is a
striking and iconic but challenging area in the northern
tropical savanna of Western Australia 'V it consistently
reaches very high temperatures, but has amazing local
wildlife, including rich and unique birdlife, and beautiful
landscapes.
We are interested in the breeding behaviour and patterns
where the two subspecies of long-tailed nch come into
contact and will be monitoring breeding in nest-boxes
set up around Kununurra township. We will collect
an array of data, including banding adults and chicks,
collecting blood and sperm samples, measuring body
morphology and bill colour, recording songs, and possi-
bly performing some behavioural experiments. The work
will be demanding, requiring long hours spent outside of-
ten in the heat while handling birds and recording data,
and working well as part of the team. We can provide
training for the techniques we use, but bird handling
experience or previous eld experience would be highly
valuable. That said, enthusiasm and a positive attitude
are the most important attributes someone could bring
to the team. We will alternate between staying in a
caravan park in town or in a national park close by. The
costs for accommodation and travel around the eld site
will be paid for, as well as domestic travel to the eld
site 'V if you would be travelling from further aeld, we
can discuss possibilities on a case by case basis.
Applications should include a CV, a short letter outlin-
ing your interests and motivation and the name of two
referees and can be sent to Callum McDiarmid at cal-
lum.mcdiarmid@hdr.mq.edu.au. They will reviewed as
they are received, until the position is lled. If you have
any further questions feel free to shoot me an email.

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth in
all of its levels, constituting an integral component of
any ecosystem. Despite that, we are currently facing
an alarming biodiversity loss due to species displace-
ment or extinction, especially in the Tropical regions of
the World. Humans are capable of incredible growth,
learning, resilience, and change in the face of challenge.
We need to tap into these core traits to step up to the
growing challenges facing biodiversity and our ecosys-
tems. *Create a short video that shares your success
conservation story, biodiversity research, opportunity,
and/or optimism for tropical biology and conservation*.
Videos must be no longer than four minutes, including
title and credits. Creativity is encouraged, and partici-pants may use various forms of media, including slow
motion, animation, illustration, and claymation, among
others.
All three (3) winners will be notied by email on or

SouthAfrica Volunteer
StripedMouseProject
Volunteers needed throughout 2020February 1, 2020 EvolDir 83
Minimum stay 2 months
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of Small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
(NOTE: This is an unpaid volunteer position. We
currently also advertise 2 paid positions as eld man-
agers for 1.5 to 3 years, and 1 postdoc position for
2 years. See other advertisements or ask via email
carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr)
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
solitary living, and social exibility in the striped mouse
and the bush Karoo rat. One focus is on the adapta-
tion to droughts, combining physiological, behavioral,
ecological and evolutionary research. As these species
are diurnal and the habitat is open, direct behavioral
observations in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Applicants must have
an interest in working in the eld and with animals.
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5:30 and
7 AM), and stops its activity with dusk (7 PM). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40 ^AoC during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for
long periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part
of a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of small mammals; direct behavioral
observations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how
blood samples are collected for physiological measure-
ments and possibly (depending on the month) how we
measure metabolic rate. Volunteers are expected to help
with maintenance of the research station (water pump,
solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1750 (around 110 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food in Springbok. Including extras (going out for
dinner; shopping), you should expect costs of about 500Euros or 600 US $per month.
German students can apply for a grant from
the Deutsche Akademischer Auslandsdienst (DAAD,
www.daad.de). Here, commonly travel grants of 300
Euro are given to students. Students from other coun-
tries are encouraged to seek funding from their home
institutions / home country. Students get an invitation
letter which they can use to apply for funding in their
home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa close
to Namibia. The vegetation consists of Succulent Ka-
roo, which has been recognized as one of 25 hotspots
of biodiversity. It is a desert to semi-desert with rain
mainly in winter (June to September).
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers
throughout 2020, though especially for the period Jan-
uary to July.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr.

NewMembers DeadlineExtended
The deadline to apply to join the SSE Diversity Com-
mittee has been extended due to the Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday coinciding with the previous deadline.
The new deadline is this Friday, January 24.
The SSE Diversity Committee (DC) seeks to add two
new members starting in 2020. The DC works to create
a professional society that is supportive of members
from all backgrounds through several main actions: by
broadening representation to the SSE Executive Council,
by pursuing initiatives that support underrepresented
groups, and by creating an inclusive, accessible environ-
ment at the Evolution conference.
Applicants should submit a brief (1-2 page) statement of
interest outlining their experience with Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion (DEI) service, and the ideas, events, and
perspective they plan to contribute during their 3-year
term. The DC seeks diverse members who represent dif-
ferent backgrounds and perspectives. Thus, we ask that
applicants describe particular elements of their back-
ground and/or identity that will contribute uniquely
to the composition of the DC. Applicants should also
identify their career stage and aliation, as we welcome
participation from members of the community across
all stages of their training, and in all career paths.
Applicants must be members of SSE (join or renew your
membership here: http://bit.ly/joinSSE) and have at-
tended at least one Evolution conference in the past.
These items should also be mentioned in the application
statement.
Many of the DC's initiatives are created and operated
with the DCs of our sister societies, the American Society
of Naturalists and the Society for Systematic Biologists.
Past or ongoing eorts of the SSE DC include:- Data collection and analysis regarding the demographic
composition of SSE
- Creation of guidelines on best practices for awards
procedures
- Events at the Evolution meeting including Story Col-
lider and mixers to build community among LGBTQ+
biologists, biologists with disabilities, biologists of color,
biologists at PUIs, and parents
- Improving accessibility at the Evolution conference
for scientists with disabilities, scientists of marginalized
genders, and scientists who are nursing/caretaking
More information about the SSE DC and our prior
initiatives can be found on our web page: http://bit.ly/-

Dr. Noah Snyder-Mackler at Arizona State University is
looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join the Dog Ag-
ing Project, a large-scale nationwide longitudinal study
of aging in companion dogs, to explore epigenomic and
metabolomic aging.
Our goal is to understand how DNA methylation and

process, to identify specic loci that are altered dur-ing the aging process, and to establish an \epigenetic
clock" for aging in companion dogs. To this end, we
seek a postdoc who will be part of our team and lead
the molecular and computational components of this
project. Working closely with our research technician
who will prepare the samples, the postdoc will lead
the analysis and interpretation of epigenomic and/or
metabolomic data.
We are seeking someone with a PhD in biology, ge-
nomics, computational biology, or a related eld, and
who has strong molecular wet lab and computational
skills. Experience with epigenomics and, in particular,

Barcelona ChromatinEvolution
Postdoctoral Fellow: Evolution of Chromatin Architec-
ture
The role: The successful candidate will comparatively
study the regulatory genome architectures of phylogenet-
ically diverse animal species (and closely related unicel-
lular allies) to understand the evolution of multicellular
gene regulation. The position will entail both performing
chromatin proling experiments (mostly HiC/HiChIP),
as well as analysing and integrating this data to de-
rive evolutionary insights. The work will be part of
our ERC-funded project EvoCellMap, which aims at
understanding how animal cell type and the associated
genome regulation originates and evolves. The candi-
date will be part of a highly interdisciplinay, interna-
tional and dynamic team composed by the Sebe-Pedros
and Marti-Renom groups, which include developmental,
computational, evolutionary and molecular biologists.
About the teams: The Sebe-Pedros Group (https://-
www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/sebe-pedros-lab)
studies genome regulation from an evolutionary
systems perspective. In particular, we are interested in
deciphering the evolutionary dynamics of animal cell
type gene regulatory networks and in reconstructing
the evolution of genome regulatory mechanisms (from
transcription factor binding through chromatin states
to the physical architecture of the genome). To this
end, we combine phylogenetics tools with functional
genomics and proteomics methods (chromatin proling,
single-cell genomics) in order to characterize and
compare cell types and epigenomic landscapes in
non-model animal and other eukaryotic species. The
Marti-Renom Group (http://marciuslab.org) at the
National Center for Genomic Analysis - Centre for
Genomic Regulation (CNAG-CRG) develops and
uses experimental and computational approaches for
characterizing the molecular regulation of cells by
studying the structure of macromolecules and their
complexes. In particular, we focus on regulatory
molecules such as RNA and chromatin.

Postdocs in evolutionary genomics and phylogenomics
are available to join the ERC 'GENECLOCKS' project
(http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/207593 en.html)
headed by Gergely Szollosi (http://ssolo.web.elte.hu) .
Two positions are oered for 2 years with the possibility
of a one year extension. The position comes with a
salary of up to EUR 43,200 per year (approx. up to
EUR 2,400-2,900 net per month after taxes), as well as
a travel and research funds.
We are looking for an individual who received his or
her PhD preferably within the last six years, who is
highly self-motivated and can work independently on a
project that he or she will help develop in the context
of GENECLOCKS.
A central theme of GENECLOCKS is disclosing new
sources of information for dating the rst three-quarters
of Earth's evolutionary history that are independent
from both fossils and molecular clocks. Life's early his-
tory has remained terra incognita until now, because
the fossils needed to calibrate standard evolutionary
timescales are simply not available for microbial life.
Microbial fossils are scarce and dicult to interpret in a
phylogenetic context with condence. In previous work
we have shown that patterns of lateral gene transfer
inferred from modern genomes encode a record of co-
existing lineages throughout the history of life, and that
we can use this record to reconstruct the relative ages
of microbial groups from the three domains of life in
deep time.
This discovery is a game changer for anyone interested
in the history of life, from either a geological or genomic
perspective. It demonstrates the existence of a new
and abundant source of dating information that is in-
scribed in the genome of any organism, provided a gene
transfer occurred in its ancestry. This constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the diversity of life.
Postdocs will undertake projects together with interna-
tional collaborators with the goal of either i) developing
new methods that systematically extract information on
the pattern and timing of genomic evolution by explain-
ing dierences between gene trees, or ii) apply existing
methods to resolve the timing of microbial evolution and
its relationship to Earth history and answer long stand-February 1, 2020 EvolDir 91
ing questions. Possible collaborations and associated
projects include:
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Eukaryotes includ-
ing their position within Archaea in collaboration with
Tom Williams at the University of Bristol.
Implementing and applying methods to include trans-
fer derived relative age constraints in molecular clock
estimates with Bastien Boussau and Vincent Daubin at
the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing novel species-tree aware phylogenetic meth-
ods with the guys who make RAxML at Exelixis Lab in
Heidelberg and Nicolas Lartillot at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing new hierarchical probabilistic models of gene
tree-species tree reconciliation with Sebastian H ohna at
LMU in Munich.
Research visits of up to several months are foreseen as
part of potential collaborations.

Vincent Richards' lab in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Clemson University is accepting applications
for a post-doctoral position.
The overarching research theme will focus on the dental
microbiome and the relationship between the bacterial
and fungal components of this community. Specic
questions include how these taxa respond and adapt to
this dynamic environment. Operating over numerous
time scales, multiple host factors such as diet, health,
disease, and host genotype can impact the oral envi-
ronment and hence are strong evolutionary forces that
can shape and select for changes within the commu-
nity. We are particularly interested in the interplay and
co-evolution of bacterial and fungal components of the
community and how these processes are impacted by
immunosuppression. Multiple omic approaches such as
comparative genomics, metagenomics, and metatran-
scriptomics will be coupled with network analyses to
address these questions.
Similar projects focusing on the oral microbiome in gen-
eral are possible and the postdoc will be free to explore
and lead such projects. The postdoc will take a se-
nior position within the laboratory and contribute to
the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate research.
The candidate should have a strong publication record
and a background in microbial community dynamics.
Ideally, the candidate should have experience analyz-
ing next-generation sequence data and be versed in
Linux/bash. Although desirable, experience with metra-
transcriptomics and network analyses are not required.
The successful applicant will be trained in multiple
bioinformatic approaches.
The position is available immediately and review of ap-
plications will continue until the position is lled. Up
to four years of support are available (with the possibil-
ity for extension). Starting salary is $50,000/year plusbenets. Applicants should contact Vincent Richards
directly at vpricha@clemson.edu. Please provide a cover
letter (describing research interests, experience, and
career goals), a CV that includes links to authored pub-
lications, and contact information for three references.
Clemson University is ranked 27th among national pub-

Cornell University
Please apply via https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/-
jobs/15773 The position is in the Plant Breeding and
Genetics Section at Cornell University, and is part of a
USDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative grant
to breed more nutritious oat. Oat is uniquely valued
among grain crops for the health-promoting composi-
tion of its seeds. This position seeks to apply novel
machine learning methods to extensive genomic, tran-
scriptomic, and metabolomic datasets. Results should
generate eective methods to improve the composition
of oat seed.
The Plant Breeding & Genetics Section, within the
School of Integrative Plant Science, trains interdisci-
plinary scientists in the elaboration of new breeding
methods, the discovery of genetic mechanisms impor-
tant for economically important traits, and the creation
of genetic stocks, germplasm, and varieties. We promote
a collaborative and interactive workspace to improve
learning, cross connectivity, and mutual support be-
tween basic and applied researchers. Cornell University
plant breeders are world leaders in innovative plant
breeding research, teaching, and extension, and we col-
laborate globally.
The Jannink lab works with several crop species (wheat,
oat, barley, cassava, and the brown algae sugar kelp) to
develop genomic prediction methods and integrate them
optimally into breeding schemes. We work together to
discover, build on, and share new ideas and tools from
across computational disciplines that lead to successful
applied breeding outcomes. With the Jannink lab, Dr.
Michael Gore and Dr. Mark Sorrells provide leadership
on the multiomic oat selection project.
In research for this project, the postdoc will collaborate
with oat breeders at Universities in Minnesota, Wiscon-
sin and South Dakota, as well as a postdoctoral associate
currently working on the project. We have characterized
an oat diversity panel of 384 genotypes with high-density
DNA marker data, RNA-seq gene expression data, and
non-targeted LC-MS, GC-MS, and targeted fatty acid
methyl ester data of mature oat seed. We will analyzeFebruary 1, 2020 EvolDir 95
these data to identify important genomic drivers of the
mature oat seed metabolome. We will test whether re-
sults from this analysis can improve prediction accuracy
in a series of 18 biparental crosses. We will also sequence
a population of 1,500 oat TILLING (Targeted Induced
Local Lesions In Genomes) lines at putative causal loci
to determine if their metabolomes are indeed aected.
We seek a candidate with machine learning expertise,
specically deep learning neural network methods, and
interest in applications relating to genetic variation and
complex biological systems. The datasets described
have rich structure and are amenable to machine learn-
ing analyses to identify patterns eluding linear models.
Aided by other project personnel, the postdoc will iden-
tify patterns in the metabolomic and transcriptomic
assays and their associations with genetic variation. The

processes-modeling The Institute
The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an inter-
national research institute based in Barcelona, Spain,
with more than 400 scientists from 44 countries. The
CRG shares principles of an interdisciplinary and cre-
ative scientic team that is supported by high-end and
innovative technologies and a exible and ecient ad-
ministration.
In 2013, the CRG received the 'HR Excellence in Re-
search' logo from the European Commission. This is in
recognition of the institute's commitment to developing
an HR Strategy for Researchers designed to bring the
practices and procedures in line with the principles of
the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of
Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers.
The Group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population genet-
ics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity. Our
lab has recently demonstrated that coding sequences
of cancer tumors not only exhibit positively selected
mutations that drive cancer (www.biorxiv.org/content/-
10.1101/485292v1), but that there exist genes that the
tumor cannot aord to lose to the mutational pres-
sure (www.nature.com/articles/ng.3987). In addition
to genes, we have also identied cancer driver loci in
the non-coding part of the genome (www.nature.com/-
articles/s41467-017-00100-x). Both coding and non-
coding selection can act to promote cancer defense mech-
anisms against therapy, which can be unveiled through
the analysis of time-sequence data of cell-free DNA and
of patient survival data.
Our lab is particularly interested in how the evolution
and survival of cancer cell populations relies on mu-
tation inux and in the selection inference from allele96 EvolDir February 1, 2020
frequency information. To this end, we develop statisti-
cal and computational approaches to estimate mutation
rates and selection. We use whole-exome sequencing
and whole-genome data repositories to analyze selection
on coding and non-coding sequences. In addition, we
analyze cell-free DNA from tumors and their tempo-
ral evolution in response to therapy. Estimates of the
strength of selection in cancer allow for a prioritization
of genes and non-coding regions by their disease rele-
vance, with the ultimate goal of promoting therapeutic
advances.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling lab was es-
tablished in October 2018 and is part of the
^A^AoBioinformatics and Genomics ^A^Aprogram at the
CRG. Further information can be found at https://-

HOW WILL SEASONAL CLOCKS IN WILD AND
AGRICULTURAL PLANTS ADAPT TO CLIMATE
CHANGE?
Shifts in the seasonal timing of owering is a commonly
observed eect of climate change. Flowering time is pri-
marily controlled by temperature and day length and,
as a result of evolution, plant responses to these cues
are often genetically adapted to the local climate. Will
future climates render such evolved controls suboptimal
and if so, what will evolution replace them with? As
part of an ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration, the
postdoc will develop and test ecological and genetically
informed life-history theory to understand how plants
should adapt their owering time strategies to climatic
changes. The project focuses on annual plants which,
due to their short generation times, are particularly
likely to exhibit rapid evolutionary responses to envi-
ronmental change. Annual plants furthermore include
important crops, invasive weeds and pollen-allergy caus-
ing plants. The theoretical work will be related to data
from barley growth experiments at dierent latitudes
across Europe and to data on plant phenology from the
Swedish Phenology Network. By improving our under-
standing of owering time adaptations in annual plants
the results of this project may nd applications in for
example plant breeding to address food security and in
predicting and managing invasive species in a changing
climate.

Postdoc - Theoretical evolutionary biology and evolu-
tionary genomics
A position for postdoctoral researchers with a PhD age
of 2-10 years is available for three years in the eld of
evolutionary genomics with the Max Planck research
group \Environmental Genomics" headed by Prof. Eva
H. Stukenbrock (see more: http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/-
envgen/<http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/envgen/ >). The
Max Planck group is aliated with the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl on and the Christian-
Albrechts University of Kiel in the North of Germany.
The position is compensated at TV-L 14 (depending on
qualications), covers 39h/week. Start of the position
is June 1st 2020.
Background
Research in the Environmental Genomics group focuses
on adaptive evolution and speciation of fungal plant
pathogens. A key question in our research is the impact
of plant domestication and agro-ecosystem structure
on plant pathogen evolution. To this end we study
large-scale datasets of fungal plant pathogens from dif-
ferent crop plants and their wild relatives. Research
in the group is highly interdisciplinary and integrates
computational and experimental approaches.
Position
The successful candidate will lead analyses of multiple
population genomic datasets, including changes in diver-
sity, admixture, signatures of selection, comparisons of
impacts and changes across species, and conduct analy-
ses to understand processes of speciation. The post doc
will supervise student projects at various levels and have
the possibility of contributing to teaching in evolution-
ary biology and population genetics at Kiel University.
The position furthermore provides extensive opportuni-
ties for collaboration within our own interdisciplinary
team, as well as at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology (https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en
<https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en >) and Kiel
Evolution Center (http://www.kec.uni-kiel.de).
The candidate should have a PhD in the eld of popu-
lation genetics/evolutionary biology. No experience in
fungal biology or genetics is required, though experi-ence with population genomic modeling, Approximate
Bayesian Computation, and database management is
a plus. Prociency in Linux scripting, in a major pro-
gramming language and in handling large datasets is a
requirement. A promising record of publication is ex-
pected. The successful applicant will be an independent,
motivated problem solver who communicates well and
enjoys working in a collaborative setting.

Postdoctoral Position, Integrative Modeling of Species
Range Shifts, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife,
Michigan State University
A postdoctoral research associate position in popula-
tion genetics and demographic modeling is available in
the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at Michigan
State University. The successful applicant will join an
established collaborative network of researchers across
ve institutions (Michigan State University, the Mor-
ton Arboretum, the College of Charleston, the Missouri
Botanical Garden, Mount Royal University) and con-
tribute to an NSF-funded data integration project fo-
cused on quantifying species' historical range shifts and
population sizes using multiple data types (for more
information see: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID=1759759). Although multiple
data types contain information on species' range shifts
(i.e., fossil pollen data, occurrence data and ecologi-
cal niche models, and population genetic data) these
datasets do not always result in equivalent inferences
(e.g., on the speed of range shifts). This project seeks to
integrate these data types in a coherent analytical frame-
work to infer demographic parameters (migration rates,
population sizes, etc.), the location of glacial refugia, and
the pace of post-glacial range movement (see Hoban et
al 2019 Ecography). The statistical framework provided
by Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a ma-
jor component of the integrative modeling approaches
we are developing. Our project team currently includes
individuals with expertise in Mathematics, Statistics,
Ecology, Biogeography, and Population Genetics, and
we look forward to welcoming a new collaborator to the
project.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Genetics, Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology, Bioinformatics, or a similar eld
with demonstrated experience in population genetics
and a robust computational skillset. In particular, ex-
perience with programming (R, Python, C++), Ap-
proximate Bayesian Computation, cluster computing,
and analysis of population genomic data is desirable.
Other desired qualications include a strong work ethic,
problem-solving and time management skills, and ex-
perience communicating scientic results. Applicants
should demonstrate an interest in joining an establishedFebruary 1, 2020 EvolDir 103

face of statistics and ecology, and in contributing to
an open-source software development project. This po-
sition includes opportunities (and funding) to engage
in a wide variety of professional development activities
(depending on areas of interest) and to participate in
planned outreach eorts associated with this project.

Montpellier
ButteryPopulationGenomics
2-year Postdoc in population genomics - CNRS Mont-
pellier, France
A 2-year post-doctoral fellowship is available to work on
the evolutionary genomics and demography of inversion
polymorphism in tropical butteries (Heliconius), in the
group of Mathieu Joron (http://joron.cefe.cnrs.fr) at the
Centre for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology (CNRS
CEFE) in Montpellier, France
Inversion polymorphisms often act as Mendelian loci
(or supergenes), switching between dierent ecological
strategies coexisting within populations, such as alter-
native social organisations in ants, mate acquisition
tactiques in birds, pollination syndromes in owering
plants, or mimicry associations in butteries. Our re-
search focuses on the spectacular wing pattern poly-
morphism of the tropical buttery Heliconius numata,
famous for its distinct mimetic forms controlled by a
series of adjacent chromosomal inversions. We study the
evolution of this genetic architecture using theoretical,
genomic, and ecological approaches.
The postdoc will lead genomic research aiming at under-standing how inversions establish and spread through
populations across the distribution range. The project
allows for much exibility in the direction taken depend-
ing on the skills and interests of the person hired. Major
objectives include, for instance, deciphering how super-
gene evolution aects population demography and dif-
fernetiation, the dissection of deleterious mutations and
antagonistic tness eects associated with inversions,
and the factors underlying disassortative mating, etc.
Datasets available include 120 resequenced genomes,
multiple independent reference assemblies, transcrip-
tomes and annotations, and will be expanded during
the project.
The postdoc will join a lively consortium of teams
(CEFE Montpellier and Museum of natural history in
Paris) and will interact with team members working on
the ecology of inversion polymorphism, the modelling of
balancing selection, or the functional dissection of wing-
patterning. Our partner institution INRIA Genscale
in Rennes is a major bioinformatics institute, so the
postdoc will enjoy direct support from a bioinformatics
team.
The CEFE is a major institute in Europe for evolu-
tionary ecology and genetics. Within CEFE, our team
comprises 12 CNRS researchers whose research combines
genetics and evolutionary ecology to address a diver-
sity of topics on adaptation and natural variation. Our
group focuses on buttery wing patterns as a model
to decipher how diversity is shaped by natural selec-
tion and other processes at the phenotypic and genomic
level. Montpellier is a major hotspot for evolutionary
and environmental research worldwide and has a vibrant
research community with several hundred researchers in
this domain, and highly praised graduate programmes.
The University of Montpellier ranked 1st in the 2018
and 2019 Shanghai ranking in Ecology. Montpellier lies
near the Mediterranean region in the South of France
and enjoys pleasant weather, fantastic nature and great
cultural and city life.
Starting date : ideally before the summer 2020, and no
later than Oct. 2020. Net salary: between 25 k ^A/year
and 35 k ^A/year depending on experience, including
social benets and public health insurance.
Candidates should have a PhD or equivalent in biologi-
cal sciences or computational biology (by the starting
date), advanced knowledge of population genetic theory,
a keen interest in understanding biodiversity. Candi-
dates should have experience with genomic datasets,
population genomics and/or demographic inferences us-

We are looking for a highly motivated postdoc to join the

group at the University of the Witwatersrand (Johan-
nesburg). The postdoc is paid via a grant of the South
African NRF for two years from Prof. Neville Pillay at
the University of the Witwatersrand. The postdoc is
expected to spend most of the time at the Succulent Ka-
roo Research Station, conducting eld work, analysing
and publishing data.
We have two possible projects for a postdoc. Both
projects are of similar interest to us. When applying,
please state for which of the two projects you apply.
Project 1: Reproductive Competition (Seasonal Unpre-
dictability and Social Flexibility)
For this project, a long-term dataset on social organisa-
tion of striped mice will be available for analyses (from
2003 to present) and further data collection will extend
to 2021. Sociality (% of solitary versus group-living
striped mice) will be studied in relation to population
density and the intensity of reproductive competition,
which is (i) very high during the spring breeding season
when all females breed, (ii) absent during most summer
dry seasons, (iii) low during summers with unexpected
rains when few females breed (6 out of 17 summers in
the current data set).
Questions and predictions: We expect that reduced re-
productive competition during summer breeding will
lead to more social instability in spring compared to
summer, i.e. groups to be more stable in summer. We
will also study which factors dier between females that
breed during the summer vs. females that don't. Fi-
nally, the impact of rare summer breeding on population
dynamics will be studied.
Time planning: Preferred start is June / July 2020 and
the position must be started in 2020. The postdoc is
expected to be in the eld for most of the time but
can plan two slots of 3 months each to spend at the
University of the Witwatersrand.
Project 2: Environmental harshness and social stress in
a biodiversity hotspot: corticosterone might not be the
only nor the best measure
Animals have to cope with harsh environments and
with stress but these phenomena are not synonymous.
Stress is the activation of the sympathetic nervous sys-
tem (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary (HPA) axis,
leading to the secretion of catecholamines and glucocor-
ticoids, providing extra energy to overcome the stressor
inducing stress. Environmental conditions are termed
harsh when they are long-lasting and life threatening,such as seasonal food shortage. Thus, while harshness
demands energy saving, stress demands increased en-
ergy expenditure, predicting that the stress response
will change as environmental harshness changes. In our
study model, the African striped mouse Rhabdomys
pumilio, we will measure several indicators of stress
under varying conditions of harshness, some for the rst
time in an eco-physiological framework. We will evaluate
three dierent aspects to dierentiate between eects
of harshness (dry season) and social stress (reproduc-
tive competition during the moist season) on survival,
and tness. These include: 1) neuropeptide y as an
indicator of sympathetic activity and thus short-term
stress; 2) corticosterone as an indicator of mid-term in-
vestment in increased energy expenditure; 3) Measures
of resting metabolic rate and how these are related to
corticosterone levels. Our study will be the rst to as-
sess how the stress response adapts to environmental
harshness, predicting that in the harsh dry season, the
HPA axis will be downregulated, while the response
of the SNS will not change seasonally, allowing for an
immediate response to life threatening events such as
predation. Thus, we predict an adaptive desynchroniza-
tion of the SNS and the HPA axis, a phenomenon so far
only described as pathology in humans. This project
will contribute fundamentally to our understanding of
how to distinguish harshness from stress and how an-
imals can cope with these two phenomena adaptively
via dierent mechanisms.
Time planning: Preferred start is June / July 2020 and
the position must be started in 2020. The postdoc is
expected to be in the eld for most of the time but can
plan to spend 1-2 months in Strasbourg (France) for
laboratory analyses and 4 months at at the University
of the Witwatersrand.
Key requirements: Strong statistical skills. Strong CV
with 3 publications from the PhD and at least 1 publi-
cation per year from postdoc studies, some of them in
high ranking journals (impact factor >3). Willingness
to spend considerable time in the eld in South Africa.

POSTDOC POSITION: Landscape genomics, Temple
University, Philadelphia, USA
The Integrative Ecology Lab (iEcoLab) at Temple Uni-
versity is seeking creative and productive applicants
for a postdoctoral researcher to lead research into the
landscape genomics of the invasive spotted lanterny
pest (Lycorma delicatula). The spotted lanterny is an
Asian planthopper that was rst introduced to the US
just outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2014, and
has since spread to ve nearby states. In addition to nat-
ural dispersal, human-assisted dispersal occurs during
all lanterny life stages: adults and nymphs hitchhike
on cars and it can spread long distances in the egg stage
because it lays eggs on mobile outdoor objects like trains
and landscaping materials. It feeds on over 70 plant
species, sometimes at very high densities, including eco-nomically important species like maples, apples, hops,
and grapes. Invaded vineyards have lost entire crops,
aecting wine production. We are just beginning to
understand its ecology and potential to cause economic
and ecological impacts, but there is still more to learn.
You can be at the forefront of cross-disciplinary research
on this emerging invasion.
The postdoctoral researcher will be mentored by Jocelyn
Behm (https://www.iecolab.org/jocelyn-e-behm/) and
will be part of a larger collaborative team of postdocs,
graduate students, and faculty at Temple University
studying and modeling spotted lanterny spread and
impacts from the labs of Matt Helmus (Biology) and
Benjamin Seibold (Math) (for a brief overview of the
project see: https://www.iecolab.org/projects/spotted-
lanterny/).| The postdoc will also interact with a
USDA-funded multi-university team of cross-disciplinary
scientists and public stakeholders and will regularly at-
tend working groups and meetings on this invasive pest.|
The anticipated start date for the landscape genetics
postdoc position is May 2020. The position is for one
year, with the possibility for renewal upon satisfactory
performance and funding. Salary is commensurate with
experience and benets are included.
The role of the landscape genetics postdoc will be to
develop research using genomic techniques to explore
the relative contributions of human-assisted versus nat-
ural dispersal to spotted lanterny spread, as well as
elucidate dispersal corridors and pathways in its invaded
range, and other noteworthy spatial genomic patterns.
There will be opportunities for the postdoc to develop
and pursue additional research questions based on their
interests.
Qualications: A PhD in Biology, Ecology, Evolution,
Genetics or other related eld Expertise in landscape
genetic and/or genomic lab and statistical methods and
associated software A competitive publication record

under carefully controlled naturalistic conditions to: 1)February 1, 2020 EvolDir 119
quantify how increased investment in competition aects
parental behaviours in either sex, according to compet-

We will also utilise behavioural variation to compare
genome-wide gene expression patterns, determining: 3)
if a high level of parental care by males is associated
with 'de-masculinisation' of gene expression, constrain-

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW POSITION IN POPU-

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, UNI-
VERSITY OF MANITOBA, CANADA
POSITION START DATE: We're targeting a start be-
tween March and July 2020, but we may be able to be
exible with start dates. Funding is for two years
CLOSING DATE FOR APPLICATIONS: We will begin
review of applications 9 Feb 2020 and the position will
remain open until lled
RANK: Post-doctoral fellow
SALARY RANGE: $45,000- $55,000 per annum (plus
benets), commensurate with qualications and experi-
encePROJECT OVERVIEW: Sea lamprey (Petromyzon mar-
inus) are native to the Atlantic Ocean and invasive in
the Great Lakes, where they cause signicant damage
to the ecosystem and shery. The objectives of this
project are to use whole genome re-sequencing data to
1) model the invasion history of the Great Lakes system
and 2) search for signatures of selection in the freshwater
populations. Sea lamprey likely moved into Lake Erie
and the upper Great Lakes following completion of the
Welland Canal which allowed passage around Niagara
Falls. Current population connectivity among the upper
Great Lakes, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario, and between
the marine and invasive freshwater populations is not
well characterized. Our goal is to use whole genome
re-sequencing of individuals sampled across 20 sample
sites within the Great Lakes, the Finger Lakes, and
Lake Champlain, and along the Atlantic coast to model
the demographics of the invasion history and gene ow
within this system.
The primary management tool currently in use to con-
trol the invasive sea lamprey populations is lampricide
treatment. The use of lampricides has reduced and held
adult sea lamprey abundance to ~10% of that observed
prior to the start of control eorts thus potentially ex-
erting strong selection. We are in the position to test
for the evolution of lampricide resistance at a suite
of candidate genes associated with physiological and
transcriptomic responses to experimental lampricide ap-
plications identied in ongoing related work. Given the
very dierent environmental conditions experienced in
marine and freshwater environments, we also may nd
evidence for selection associated with selection pressures
other than lampricide applications (e.g., associated with
osmoregulation and life history trait variation).
Please send any additional questions about the position
to colin.garroway@umanitoba.ca
JOB DESCRIPTION: The primary task of this position
will be to model gene ow and the demography of the
invasion at the best resolution our data aords, and to
test for signatures of selection associated with candidate
loci for lampricide resistance. We also want to stress
that the PDF will have the opportunity to develop and
pursue other research questions of their own interests.
You will be joining a well funded sea lamprey research
program that is jointly led by Margaret Docker, Ken
Jeries, and myself Colin Garroway, and comprised of 2
postdocs, 2 PhD students, and 2 MSc students with ad-
ditional students working on related questions in other
species.

UppsalaU MetagenomicsAntimicro-
bialResistance
A postdoctoral researcher position in metagenomics with
focus on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
in wild mammals is available in the group of Katerina
Guschanski at the Department of Ecology and Genet-
ics, Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University,Sweden. The project is funded by the Carl Tryggers
Foundation and the Swedish Research Council, FOR-
MAS.
Our group is broadly interested in understanding how
long-term evolutionary and short-term human-mediated
processes shape biological diversity. To achieve this
goal, and in particular to quantify the human impact on
the environment, we take a temporal approach, study-
ing time-spaced museum-preserved specimens of focal
animal species and their associated microorganisms.
Project: We aim to understand the eect of human activ-
ities on host-associated microbiomes of wild mammalian
populations. This project focuses on identifying antimi-
crobial resistance factors from ancient microbial com-
munities derived from host-associated oral microbiomes,
as preserved in dental calculus, a bacterial biolm that
builds on the teeth of vertebrates. Only few decades
after the advent of the antibiotics mass production in
1940s, AMR has become a major global health threat.
Yet, we know very little about the role of wild animal
populations in the global AMR dynamics and the poten-
tial of wildlife to act as reservoirs for AMR genes. To
provide a baseline of natural AMR prevalence, we will
characterize na ve host-associated bacterial communities
from time periods that predate the mass production of
antibiotics. Subsequently, we will evaluate in how far
human-produced antibiotics have changed the composi-
tion, functional proles and particularly antimicrobial
potential of host-associated microbiomes using several
Scandinavian mammals as models. The project has the
potential to expand into the study of oral pathologies,
diet and population genomics of wild mammals. Thus,
depending on the candidate's interests and experience,
links can be built to pathogen evolution, conservation
biology and ecology.
Qualication: The successful candidate must have a
doctoral degree, or a foreign degree equivalent, in evo-
lutionary biology, metagenomics, medical microbiology,
bioinformatics or a related eld. We are looking for
a highly motivated, creative and skilled postdoctoral
scientist to drive large-scale metagenomic data genera-
tion and analysis. Large parts of the data are already
available, but additional data needs to be generated.
Therefore, the ideal candidate will have both wet lab
and bioinformatics skills. Experience with ancient DNA
techniques will be an important asset. The candidate
should have a solid background in evolutionary metage-
nomics, familiarity with AMR databases, experience
with AMR analyses from metagenomic datasets, and
bioinformatics skills to handle large-scale genomic data.
A passion for science, good interpersonal skills, and
strong writing skills are prerequisites for the position.
We are looking for a candidate with an open-minded,128 EvolDir February 1, 2020
cooperative attitude, who can work both independently
and in a team, and is open to training junior group
members. This project is carried out in collaboration
with a number of researchers in Sweden and worldwide.
Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to communi-
cate clearly across disciplines are required. Prociency
in English is a requirement.
The environment: The Evolutionary Biology Centre is
one of the world's leading research institutions in evo-
lutionary biology and part of Uppsala University - the
oldest university in Scandinavia. Uppsala University,
ranked 7th in the world in evolutionary biology (CWUR
2017), attracts approximately 40.000 students from all
over the world, creating an international and stimulat-
ing research environment. The research themes at the
Department of Ecology and Genetics (www.ieg.uu.se)
spans the scope from evolutionary ecology to genetics
and metagenomics to studies of ecosystems. The city of
Uppsala is a vibrant college town, conveniently situated
40 minutes by train from Stockholm (and even closer to
the Arlanda International Airport), with beautiful and
easy accessible surroundings.
Appointment: The postdoc is funded by a tax-free 2-
year scholarship from the Carl Tryggers Foundation,
amounting to 25,000 SEK per month. It is a require-
ment from the funding agency that you are an incoming
postdoc (i.e. that your Ph.D. is not from Uppsala Uni-
versity). Start date is negotiable, but strong preference
will be given to candidates that can start by May 2020.
How to apply: The application should include (1) a
cover letter of max 2 pages that clearly states the can-
didate's research interests, qualication, and relevant
experience, (2) CV including a list of publications, (3)
copy of the doctoral degree, and (4) contact information

Postdoctoral Position Available in Plant Evolutionary
Ecology, Sultan Lab
Transgenerational plasticity
The Sultan lab at Wesleyan University is seeking a
postdoctoral research associate with greenhouse experi-
ence who is scientically creative, a capable statistician,
and interested in current ideas regarding inclusive in-
heritance and plasticity, for a grant-funded study of
inherited environmental eects.
The position can begin any time between December
2020 and early 2021, and will continue until October 15
2022 (up to 22 months full-time salary).
Familiarity with molecular approaches is a plus but is
not essential.
The project will continue the lab's work on transgener-
ational eects of parental light vs shade conditions in
the generalist annual Polygonum persicaria.
The goal is to examine how genotype, parent environ-
ment, and current environment interactively inuence
phenotypic outcomes and hence adaptive variation in a
natural system.
Using inbred genotypes raised in factorial combinations
of previous and current environments, we will collect
data across the life cycle on phenotypic trait expression,
transcriptome changes, and site-specic methylation
changes, though a combination of greenhouse growth
experiments and molecular work (which will be carried
out by graduate students and another postdoc in the
lab). Depending on the post-doc's interests and toolbox,there is plenty of opportunity to add elements to the
project, such as an ecophysiology or eld study, a model-
ing dimension, additional greenhouse or demethylation
experiments, etc.
This work is part of a $2 million consortium grant
from the Templeton Foundation to investigate how
environmentally inuenced, real-time regulatory, de-
velopmental and behavioral processes in organisms
may lead to adaptation and trait innovation (https:/-
/agencyinlivingsystems.com/). The overall project in-
cludes 4 research labs including Armin Moczek (Indiana
Univ), Jukka Jernvall (Helsinki) and Deborah Gordon
(Stanford), with each lab investigating a dierent level
of biological organization.
A philosophy of biology group (led by Denis Walsh at
Univ of Toronto) is working on theoretical implications.
The grant includes collaborative travel among team PI's
and postdocs as well as international workshops. For
a young scientist who is keen to explore new ideas in
evolutionary biology, this should be an exciting oppor-
tunity.
Wesleyan is a small, selective Liberal Arts university
with a diverse student and faculty community, outstand-
ing arts and culture (especially music and the performing
arts), and a tradition of excellence in both research and
teaching. The Sultan lab is a supportive, high-energy
group that currently includes 3 grad students and 4
undergrads.
The campus is located in the small city of Middletown
on the Connecticut River in central CT, close to many
hiking and kayaking options. It is 30 minutes from Yale
and University of Connecticut, and 2 hours' drive to
Boston or New York City.
To apply or for further information, please contact Prof.

pipeline.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at students, researchers and profes-
sionals interested in learning the dierent steps involved
in a GWAS study using them to build a structured
pipeline for semi-automated and reproducibile GWAS
analyses. It will include information useful for both
beginners and more advanced users. We will start by
introducing general concepts of GWAS and bioinfor-
matics pipeline building, progressively describing all
steps and putting there seamlessy together in a general
workow. Attendees should have a background in biol-
ogy, specically genetics; previous exposure to GWAS
experiments would also be benecial. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using

laborator and sponsor of the Genome 10K project. To-
gether with the collaborators, BGI-Qingdao contributed
to a number of conservation genomics projects including
genomes of oyster, proteus, bamboo shark, and atsh.
The course will host 25-30 participants dedicated to the
conservation of animals and plants and about 20-25 dis-
tinguished faculty from around the world. The course is
directed by its founder, Dr. Stephen J. O' ^ABrien, and

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the course 'FINITE EL-
EMENT ANALYSIS APPLIED TO LIFE SCIENCES'.
Instructors: Dr. Josep Fortuny (Institut Catala de Pa-
leontologia M. C., Spain) and Dr. Jordi Marce-Nogue
(Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Spain) Dates: June 8th-
12th, 2020 Location: Crete, Greece Early-bird deadline:
April 30th, 2020
COURSE OVERVIEW: Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
is a great tool for biologists, palaeontologists, doctors,
veterinarians, and other life sciences specialities in which
researchers face questions about biomechanics of living
and extinct organisms. Elements like bone, arthropod
exoskeleton, mollusc shells, or the stems and leaves of
plants can be analysed using this technique. FEA is a
non-invasive modelling technique, based on the princi-
ple of dividing a system into a nite number of discrete
elements where the equations are applied. Although
static and dynamic analysis can be solved using FEA,
in this course only static analysis will be covered.
In this course, there will be an introduction to the Fi-
nite Element in order to model biological structures and
understand how they work. We will cover all the steps
involved in FEA (for static analysis) except the creation
or reconstruction of the model. After the theoretical
introduction, we will build and analyse 2D and 3D -
nite element models of skeletal elements and deepen on
the methods and software's required to perform FEA.
Key questions as mesh size, boundary conditions, ap-
plied forces, scaling and numerical singularities will be
thoroughly addressed.
PROGRAM: Monday
An introduction to the use of Finite Element Analysis
(FEA): - Mathematical model, features and practical
procedure.
Basic continuum mechanics: - Stress, displacements,
strain, constitutive equations. - Failure criteria on elas-
tic materials.
Tuesday
Theoretical approach to Meshing: - Types of mesh. -
Mesh generation. - How to evaluate a mesh (quality and
reliability). - Recommendations for a good practice.Material Properties: - Biomechanical properties of the
bones to be used in FEA. - Considerations for non-lineal
materials to understand the modelling of soft tissues. -
Boundary conditions and Forces in biological systems.
Wednesday
2D Plane models reconstruction: - Theoretical tools for
the creation of 2D plane FEA models of biological struc-
tures. - A practical guided example in an Artiodactyla
jaw.
Thursday
3D models: - Theoretical tools for the creation of 3D
FEA models of biological structures.
CASE STUDY: - Alligator jaw: Biological Implications.
Interpretation of the results.
Friday
Working with real examples. Creation of a complete
FEA model.

This workshop has been given yearly since 2011. Since
2017 it has been given at the Friday Harbor Laborato-
ries of the University of Washington, located at Friday
Harbor on beautiful San Juan Island.
The workshop will review the basics of theory in the eld
of evolutionary quantitative genetics and its connections
to evolution observed at various time scales. One aim
of the workshop is to build a bridge between the tradi-
tionally separate disciplines of quantitative genetics and
comparative methods.
Quantitative genetic theory for natural populations was
developed considerably in the period from 1970 to 1990
and up to the present, and it has been applied to a wide
range of phenomena including the evolution of dier-
ences between the sexes, sexual preferences, life history
traits, plasticity of traits, as well as the evolution of
body size and other morphological measurements.
Phylogenetic approaches to comparative biology were
developed in the 1980s and 1990s, including inferring
how traits covary in evolution and how optimum values
of traits vary between species.
Textbooks have not kept pace with these developments,
and currently few universities oer courses on these
subjects aimed at evolutionary biologists.
Evolutionary biologists need to understand this eld
because of the ability to collect large amounts of data
by computer, the development of statistical methods for
changes of traits on evolutionary trees and for changes
in a single species through time, and the realization that
quantitative characters will not soon be fully explained
by genomics. This workshop aims to ll this need by re-
viewing basic aspects of theory and illustrating how that
theory can be tested with data, both from single species
and from multiple-species phylogenies. Participants will
use R, an open-source statistical programming language,
to build and test evolutionary models.
The workshop involves lectures and in-class computer
exercises. You can consult the 2019 workshop website
for examples, using the links found at the 2019 schedule
mentioned above.
The intended participants for this workshop are grad-
uate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty
members in evolutionary biology. The workshop can
accommodate up to 30 participants. Guest instructors
are:
* Patrick Carter, Evolutionary Physiology, Washington
State University, Pullman * Adam Jones, BiologicalSciences, University of Idaho * Michelle Lawing, Ecol-
ogy and Conservation Biology, Texas A&M University *
Brian O'Meara, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, Univ.
of Tennessee, Knoxville * Samantha Price, Biological
Sciences, Clemson University * Josef Uyeda, Biological
Sciences, Virginia Tech,
Cost: $1000, to be paid to Friday Harbor Laboratories.
This fee will cover housing and meals at FHL and all
other workshop expenses except travel. Participants
who have been admitted to attend will make their pay-
ment prior to arrival at FHL. Details of payment by
credit card or check will be provided once the applicant
has been admitted to attend.
We have also applied to several scientic societies for
additional support which would enable a 20% refund
of the workshop fee to participants who are members
of those societies, if the societies agree to provide this
support. We will know whether this will be available
by the time that we notify people of acceptance to the
Workshop, and details will also appear on the Workshop
web pages by then.

SLiMEvolutionaryModeling
May18-22
Hi all.
First of all, as background: SLiM is a software package
for creating evolutionary models/simulations that areindividual-based and genetically explicit. It is script-
able, exible, fast, and includes an interactive graphical
modeling environment. You can read more about it on
its home page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
May 18-22, 2020, a ve-day SLiM workshop will be of-
fered at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA, USA). It
will be hosted by Daren Card and Timothy Sackton, of
Harvard. It will be free, and open to participants outside
of the university. HOWEVER, registration is required,
a limited number of seats are available, and a set por-
tion of seats will be given to registrants aliated with
Harvard. To apply, please send an email to ALL OF
Daren, Timothy, and myself (dcard@fas.harvard.edu,
tsackton@g.harvard.edu, bhaller@mac.com) with the
info below. Priority for Harvard applicants will end
on 15 February; after that date it will be rst-come-
rst-served for all remaining seats so that we can notify
everyone of their acceptance in time to make travel
arrangements. Early application is advised; these work-
shops have been lling to capacity.
For this workshop, your application email should include:
(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any other
forward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM that
you hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted.
The plan is to cover all the major topics in the SLiM man-
ual, starting with lots of introductory material to get be-
ginners up to speed with SLiM and its associated script-
ing language Eidos, and ending up at advanced topics
like non-Wright-Fisher models, tree-sequence recording,
continuous-space models, and nucleotide-based models.
We won't cover everything in the manual \ that would
be overwhelming! " but we'll try to cover all the big
topics. There will also be time for attendees to work on
their own models with help from me, and we may also
have time to explore some optional side topics that are
of particular interest to those attending each workshop.
The workshop will be taught principally using SLiMgui
on macOS. Every attendee will need their own Mac
laptop. Loaner Mac laptops are unlikely to be available
for this workshop; running macOS inside VirtualBox
on another operating system is also possible, but please
make sure that this works for you before registering. (A
Mac is required to run SLiMgui, which is necessary for146 EvolDir February 1, 2020
teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).
Cheers,

MADPHYLO: Madrid Workshop in Statistical Phyloge-
netics
Where: Real Jardin Botanico (CSIC), Madrid, Spain
When: 10-20 March 2020
www.madphylo.com Course overview:
We are proud to announce the third edition of MAD-
PHYLO, Madrid Workshop in Statistical Phylogenetics.
Darwin founded the eld of evolutionary biology on the
concept that all organisms are related to one another
through an unknown evolutionary tree. Phylogenetic
or evolutionary inference has become an essential tool
in many disciplines across the life sciences, from molec-
ular epidemiology to paleontology. In this workshop,
the participants will learn the theoretical and technical
basis of stochastic modeling in evolutionary biology and
phylogenetics. The workshop will also provide full train-
ing in the open software RevBayes, an R-like interactive
environment based on graphical model concepts for the
modeling of complex evolutionary problems. At the end
of the workshop, the student will have an understand-
ing of the assumptions behind state-of-the-art methods
used in modern phylogenetic analysis, as well as being
able to build up new models from existing functions in
RevBayes.
Instructors:
The lecturers are prominent analytical systematists and
evolutionary biologists, who are behind the develop-
ment of many of the methodological and computing
tools routinely used in modern phylogenetic inference
and evolutionary biology.
Workshop details:
The course will be taught from March 10 to March 20
2020. Lectures and practicals will be tightly linked,meaning that you will learn the theory and also how
to apply the theory on the same day. Students are en-
couraged to bring their own laptops. The tuition for
the course has been lowered this year to 400 Euros. It
includes coee breaks and a light lunch. However, this
tuition does not include room and board during the
course. You will be required to nd a place to stay if
you are from outside of Madrid.

EvolvingMicrobialCommunities
Apr27-30
This small workshop ( ~50 participants) will take place
at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology,
in Pl on, Germany, from April 27th to April 30, 2020.
The realisation that evolution can be fast enough to
aect microbial species interactions and abundance has
changed the eld of community dynamics. Scientists
have started integrating methods from population biol-
ogy and evolutionary biology to understand how micro-
bial communities may change under dierent conditions
and spatial scales. Although progress has been made, it
is yet quite challenging to understand microbial commu-
nities in their natural complexity. With our workshop
\Evolving Microbial Communities" we aim to discuss the
recent advances in the eld and new concepts for under-
standing and predicting how and why communities are
changing over time. We aim to invite top researchers
that investigate the area from dierent elds (experi-
ment, theory) and promote dialogue among them. We
would be very excited if you could join us as a leader
in this conversation. We would ask you to prepare a 30
min talk plus 10 min discussion.Here is a link to register to our workshop. https://-
workshops.evolbio.mpg.de/event/26/registrations/25/
We are looking forward to welcoming you in Pl on, lo-
cated within a beautiful lake region not far from the
Baltic Sea. Please send your abstract no later than
March 6th, 2020.

scientists in computational methods used in evolutionary
and ecological research.
EMSI brings together internationally recognized experts
in evolutionary biology with students and health prac-
titioners who want to apply these perspectives to can-
cer, infectious disease, evolution of microbial resistance,
neurology, autoimmune disease, the microbiome, and
more. Lectures on key concepts are complimented with
hands-on computational exercises. Our goal is to give
participants the background on evolutionary principles
and the tools to apply evolutionary biology to questions
of medical and veterinary importance.

ScienceMediaTrainingSchool
Apr14-16
EuroScitizen COST Action is organizing a Science-
Media Training School directed at young journalists
and young scientists. By joining these two groups we
aim to improve the quality of the communication and
understanding between scientists and media, thus to
contribute to the increase of the quality of science com-
munication.
Our goal is to create a new wave of eective communi-
cation between scientists and journalists to demonstrate
that by working together, those groups have power to
create meaningful, understandable and open science
messages for the public. We hope to provide a founda-
tion for developing ecient links between the scientic
and media communities counteracting the increase in
fake news, the plummeting quality of journalistic out-
puts, in this complex, constantly changing landscape
of scientic evidence. In fact we believe that this will
empower the society and raise science awareness among
people because knowledge has the power to improve our
surroundings and quality of life. This Training School
will oer you an extensive practice, conducted by a
diverse and experienced trainers with scientic and me-
dia background. The Training School has three main
objectives:
1. Information sharing - to spread awareness across
trainees who are interested in disseminating reliable sci-
entic information in media, by providing them with
skills and tools to communicate science eectively; 2.
Discussion - to exchange perspectives on topics fromtwo dierent angles and two, not so dierent, attitudes
represented by journalists and scientists, promoting the
communication between these two groups; 3. Commu-
nity building - to help scientists and journalists nd best
ways of engaging in science communication together,
bringing to it the best of the two worlds.
The event will take place from 8AM of 14th of April to
17PM of the 16th April 2020.
We welcome both young journalists and young sci-
entists to our training school. For more details and

Instructor: Siavash Mirarab (University of Califor-
nia, US), Sabrina Simon (Wageningen University, NL),

The group \Systematics, Biogeography and Diversity"
of the German Zoological Society (DZG) will host a
workshop named \The battle of species tree estimation
- a coalescent-based approach or concatenation?" from
February 28th to March 1st 2020 at the University of
Freiburg. The workshop pays particular attention to the
practical application and comprises some short lectures.
Time is reserved for practical exercises and genomic
data analyses of your own or provided datasets covering
zoological research questions. As guest speaker and
teacher Siavash Mirarab (University of California, US),
the international expert and developer of the ASTRAL
algorithm, conrmed his attendance. The number of
participants is limited to 25 to ensure eective support
during the workshop. The places will be allocated ac-
cording to the \rst come, rst served" principle. No
participation fee will be charged. Board and accommo-
dation are at your own expenses.
Workshop information: Nowadays, systematic studies
are characterized by the analysis of large molecular data
sets (phylogenomics). With the generation and increas-
ing availability of large sequence data by e.g. genome or
transcriptome sequencing eorts, phylogenetic system-
atics faces the challenge of adapting traditional analysis
methods. The traditional phylogenomic approach is the
analysis of multi-gene matrices, in which dierent loci
are combined into a single supermatrix (concatenation).
In recent years, this approach has been increasingly con-
troversial discussed because it does not take into account
biological processes such as gene duplication and loss,
horizontal gene transfer and incomplete lineage sorting
(ILS). In this context, the multispecies coalescent (MSC)
model has proven to be a highly eective method for
evaluating phylogenies, since it involves ancestral poly-
morphisms and conicts between species and gene trees.
However, since the coalescence method is also based on
the assumption that the examined locus always has a his-
tory, but this is not always the case due to far-reaching
splitting events and / or high recombination rates, this
method is again critically discussed. As a result, a
critical evaluation of both phylogenetic reconstruction
methods and their resulting phylogenetic relationships
is more important than ever. During the 2 ^A1
2day work-February 1, 2020 EvolDir 151
shop, a theoretical and practical introduction to both
reconstruction methods will be given, whereby the par-
ticipants should work on their own or provided reduced
genomic data sets. The dierent approaches and the
methods used for phylogenetic reconstruction are then
discussed, compared and critically examined. For the
multispecies coalescent (MSC) method, ASTRAL (Ac-
curate Species TRee Algorithm) has been established
in recent years as the preferred and proven method for
estimating a species tree under the MSC model. Siavash
Mirarab (University of California, US), Sabrina Simon
(Wageningen University, NL), Manuela Sann (Albert
Ludwig University of Freiburg) and Karen Meusemann
(Albert Ludwig University) provide an introduction to
the multispecies coalescent (MSC) method (ASTRAL-
Pro, ASTRAL-MP), the analysis of multi-gene matrices,
and methods for evaluating resulting family trees, e.g.
quartet scores.
The following requirements are necessary for participa-
tion: Participants must bring their own laptop for the
analyses (preferred operating system is Linux or Mac
OS). Alternatively, we ask the participants to install a
virtual machine with Ubuntu 18.04 (e.g. VMWare or
Virtual Box) ahead the course. It is explicitly requested
that the participants bring their own genomic data
sets (reduced to approx. 10 genes and 10-20 species).
However, we will also provide sample datasets. The
workshop will be held in English.
Please register for the workshop by February 1st, 2020

SLiMEvolutionaryModeling
Mar6-10
Hi all. I'm posting this workshop a second time, sincethere are still a couple of spaces free. THIS IS THE
ONLY WORKSHOP I AM LIKELY TO RUN IN EU-
ROPE UNTIL MID-2021.
March 6-10, 2020, a ve-day SLiM workshop will be
oered at the University of Iceland (Reykjav k, Ice-
land). It will be hosted by Sn ~Abj orn P alsson and Arnar
P alsson, of the University of Iceland (H ask oli  slands).
It will be free, and open to participants outside of
the university. HOWEVER, registration is required,
and a limited number of seats are available. To apply,
please send an email to BOTH Sn ~Abj orn and myself
(snaebj@hi.is, bhaller@mac.com) with the info below.
Admission is now rst-come-rst-served so that we can
notify everyone of their acceptance in time to make
travel arrangements.
As background: SLiM is a software package for creating
evolutionary models/simulations that are individual-
based and genetically explicit. It is scriptable, exible,
fast, and includes an interactive graphical modeling en-
vironment. You can read more about it on its home
page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
The dates for it have been chosen to dovetail with
the Oikos conference in Reykjav k, which is March 3-
5 (https://www.oikos2020.org); we hope that this will
make the workshop more convenient for many to at-
tend, but the two events are not aliated (in other
words, attendance at Oikos is not required to attend
the workshop).
For this workshop, your application email should include:
(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any other
forward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM that
you hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted.
The plan is to cover all the major topics in the SLiM man-
ual, starting with lots of introductory material to get be-
ginners up to speed with SLiM and its associated script-
ing language Eidos, and ending up at advanced topics
like non-Wright-Fisher models, tree-sequence recording,
continuous-space models, and nucleotide-based models.
We won't cover everything in the manual - that would
be overwhelming! - but we'll try to cover all the big
topics. There will also be time for attendees to work on
their own models with help from me, and we may also152 EvolDir February 1, 2020
have time to explore some optional side topics that are
of particular interest to those attending each workshop.
The workshop will be taught principally using SLiMgui
on macOS. Every attendee will need their own Mac lap-
top, but running macOS inside VirtualBox on another
operating system is also possible. (A Mac is required to
run SLiMgui, which is necessary for teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).
Cheers,
Benjamin C. Haller Messer Lab Cornell University

Vienna MIC-Phy May25-27
Meeting: Mathematical, inferential and computational
phylogenomics (MIC-Phy)
Date: 25-27 May 2020
Location: Vetmeduni Vienna, Austria
Scope: Phylogenomics aims at reconstructing the evolu-tionary histories of organisms considering whole genomes
or large fractions of genomes. The abundance of genomic
data for an enormous variety of organisms has enabled
phylogenomic inference of many groups, and this has
motivated the development of a myriad of models and
methods. The MIC-Phy meeting intends to stimulate
a larger debate focus on the main advances and chal-
lenges of the current phylogenetic models, methods and
algorithms that are permitting to make sense of phy-
logenomic data.
Cost: The meeting is sponsored by WWTF and there
is no registration fee.
Workshop: The meeting includes a workshop entitled
*New approaches and methods to phylogeny inference*
that will focus on the polymorphism-aware phylogeny
estimation, including practical exercises based on the
software IQ-TREE and RevBayes.
Keynote speakers: * Ziheng Yang (University College
of London, UK) * Tracy Heath (Iowa State University
of Science and Technology, USA)
Important dates: * Deadline for workshop registration
and abstract submission: March 31, 2020 * Notication
of oral presentation and/or workshop acceptance: April
15, 2020 * Registration deadline: May 1, 2020
Registration: Please visit https://-

The 2020 Workshop on Molecular Evolution at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mas-
sachusetts, USA, will be held *** MAY 31 to JUNE 10
*** (note that this is earlier than past years).
Deadline for applications is *** FEBRUARY 12,
2020 *** : see https://ws2.mbl.edu/studentapp/-
studentapp.asp?courseid=mole Founded in 1988, the
Workshop on Molecular Evolution is the longest-running
workshop of its kind. The Workshop is the premier
program for integrating the methods, theory, and appli-
cations of molecular phylogenetics, statistical genetics,
molecular evolution, and related disciplines. Students
work closely with internationally-recognized scientists,
receiving: (i) high-level instruction in the principles of
molecular evolution, phylogenetic inference, and evo-
lutionary genomics; (ii) advanced training in statisti-
cal methods best suited to modern datasets; and (iii)hands-on experience with the latest software tools (often
from the authors of the programs they are using). The
material is delivered via lectures, discussions, and bioin-
formatic exercises motivated by contemporary topics
in molecular evolution. A hallmark of this workshop is
the direct interaction between students and eld-leading
scientists. The workshop serves graduate students, post-
docs, and established faculty from around the world
seeking to apply the principles of molecular evolution to
questions of both basic and applied biological sciences.
A priority of this workshop is to foster an environment
where students can learn from each other as well from
the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to use
the following software to address questions concerning
the origins, maintenance, and function of molecular vari-
ation: ASTRAL, BEST, FASTA, FigTree, IQTree, MI-
GRATE, MAFFT, MP-EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML,
PAUP*, SVD Quartets, and SNaQ. Students will have
the opportunity to work with software on their own
laptops as well as receive training on how to use the
same programs on a computer cluster.
In 2020 the course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joe
Bielawski, Jeremy Brown, Minh Bui, Belinda Chang,
Scott Edwards, Deise Goncalves, Kelley Harris, Tracy
Heath, John Huelsenbeck, Lacey Knowles, Laura Ku-
batko, Aki Laruson, Paul Lewis, Emily Jane McTavish,
Claudia Solis-Lemus, Ed Susko, David Swoord, Katie

InstructionsFebruary 1, 2020 EvolDir 155
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
