AsilomarCalifornia.ASN Symposium Call.2023
The American Society of Naturalists
Proposals for Symposia at the ASN stand-alone meeting
in Asilomar 2023
Due July 01, 2022
The American Society of Naturalists will be going back
to Asilomar in Pacic Grove, California, to hold our
stand-alone conference Asilomar 2023 on 6-10 January
2023!
Have an idea for a special symposium? We want to hear
it!
The ASN Symposium Committee invites you to submit
proposals for a special symposium. Proposed sympo-
sium topics should support the Society's goal to advance
the conceptual unication of the biological sciences and
to further knowledge in evolution, ecology, behavior,
and organismal biology. Topics could center around
important emerging issues in evolution, ecology, or be-
havior or focus on a pivotal historical paper, tracing
its impact and exploring current cutting-edge research
inspired by this work. A budget of up to $8,000 is avail-able to defray travel, registration, and lodging costs for
speakers.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (up to one page); (3) a list of six
speakers, including institutional aliations, who have
agreed to participate in the symposium; (4) a justica-
tion for the symposium, explaining why the topic and
speakers are appropriate for an ASN symposium (up to
one page).
Please submit proposals by email
(rachel.spigler[at]temple.edu) no later than mid-
night Eastern Time on July 01, 2022. Send your
proposal as a single pdf attachment, under subject
heading 'ASN Asilomar 2023 Symposium Proposal'. A
conrmation email will be sent within 1-2d of receipt.
In line with the ASN's commitment to diversity, we en-
courage including speakers from groups who have been
historically excluded from STEM. Therefore, proposals
that include a diverse list of speakers from a range of
backgrounds, institutions, career stages, geography, gen-
der, race etc.are especially encouraged. The Society's
selection committee will evaluate proposals based on
their potential to attracting substantial audience and
stimulate discussion, the signicance and timeliness of
the topic, and on the topic's diering substantively from
recent symposia hosted by the Society. Applicants will
be notied of the decision before the end of July 2022.

SMBE Satellite Meeting on Evolutionary Rescue Kiel
University, Germany, 11-14 September 2022
Conference website: https://-
workshops.evolbio.mpg.de/event/57/ We are currently
living in the Anthropocene and thus an era shaped by
human impact. The environmental conditions imposed
by these human-driven rapid environmental changes
exert selective pressure on natural systems and can
result in an evolutionary mismatch between slowly
evolving organisms and their new environment, and
rapid adaptation of many short-lived species. Evolution-
ary rescue, which occurs when populations subjected to
stress avoid extinction by adaptation through natural
selection, is relevant to both consequences: it can help
to overcome the evolutionary mismatch and is at the
basis of rapid evolution of pathogens.
In this SMBE Satellite meeting we aim to focus on evo-
lutionary rescue in three main elds: species conserva-
tion, agriculture, and medicine. These three main eldscurrently face unforetold challenges due to evolution-
ary processes invoked by the dramatic human-mediated
changes of the Anthropocene, including:
- Risk of species extinction and thus dramatic reduc-
tions in biodiversity due to an evolutionary mismatch
caused by climate change, globalization, and pathogen
evolution - Risk of dramatic yield reductions in food
production due to an evolutionary mismatch caused
by climate change, globalization, and pathogen evolu-
tion - Major threats to human health because of rapid
pathogen evolution and increased pathogen spread due
to globalization - Rapid evolution of pathogens, para-
sites, and pest species and especially fast evolution of
resistance to chemotherapy and pesticides
By incorporating diverse perspective from multiple elds,
we hope to identify knowledge gaps and putative novel
research directions in the context of evolutionary rescue
in the Anthropocene.

Dear colleagues,
We are organizing a 3-day workshop on the \Mathe-
matical modelling of microbiomes" at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen (Germany)
in the fall. This will happen on 14-17th September 2022.
We want to invite you to this meeting. Below we detail a
bit better what we have in mind for the workshop. You
can check register and check other details at: https://-
workshops.evolbio.mpg.de/event/60/ The deadline for
registration is July 1st.
We look forward to welcoming you in Ploen in Septem-
ber!

Abstract
Most multi-cellular organisms do not live in isolation,
but cohabit with a set of micro-organisms in a nested
ecosystem called the microbiome. Host-associated mi-
crobiomes can be essential to host health, and attempts
have been made to manipulate them for therapeutic
purposes. Yet, we still have little understanding of the
ecological and evolutionary processes involved in micro-
biomes dynamics. Mathematical modeling is a powerful
tool to address the biological questions that arise:
- What determines microbiome composition? - How do
microbiomes evolve with their hosts? - How is micro-
biome diversity maintained? - How do microbiomes
help the host adapt to its environment? - What are the
physical and immunological constraints imposed by the
host in various anatomical compartments?
In this workshop, we aim at discussing advances in
microbiome modeling, identifying open questions and
specicities, as well as framing these topics in the larger
eco-evolutionary theory. The emphasis will be on the
technical questions that emerge from these works, in
particular how to identify relevant assumptions in the
building of models. To this eect, we will invite the
presenters to adopt a chalk talk format. We encourage
the application of researchers at any career stage, work-
ing with mathematical tools on any microbiome system.
We will strive to create an inclusive and interactive
environment with a restricted number of participants(30-40), reserving some time to discuss the pressing open
questions of this research eld.
Conrmed speakers include:

Abstract deadline 15 June 202210 EvolDir July 1, 2022
Bauhin symposium, Basel, Switzerland 15-16 September
2022. Call for contributions
An ever widening array of research disciplines require
access to plant specimens preserved in herbaria, be-
cause they provide data calibrated in absolute time. In
an era when land use and the global climate rapidly
change, technological innovations, such as ancient DNA
sequencing and digital specimens, are opening new av-
enues for timely research, leveraging the the specimens
that were accumulated over more than four centuries
of plant collecting. This year, 2022, marks the 400th
anniversary of one of the rst regional oras, published
by Caspar Bauhin (1560-1624) based on his herbarium
that survives to today.
To celebrate the deep history of plant collections, and
to explore the cutting edge of herbarium-based research,
we are organizing a two-day international symposium
in Basel, Switzerland, in honor of Caspar Bauhin: \400
Years of Botanical Collections ' Implications for Present-
Day Research".
Please submit your abstract for talks and posters on any
topic in any discipline that leverages herbarium spec-
imens. We particularly encourage contributions that
make use of specimens in non-standard ways and that
push the boundaries of what is currently possible.
The deadline for abstract submissions is 15 June 2022
Please consult the symposium website for all details.

Dear Colleagues,
We invite you to join us at the rst community meeting
of the Island Systems Integration Consortium (ISIC)!
We are a new NSF-sponsored Research Coordination
Network (RCN) focusing on interdisciplinary science
in the Galapagos. With this meeting, we will bring
together geologists, biologists, and climate scientists
to identify and pursue innovative, interdisciplinary
questions for the next chapter of Galapagos research.
We have planned our rst \All-Hands" meeting to take
place October 24-28 in Cincinatti, Ohio. ISIC aims to
bring together a community of scientists working in the
Gal apagos from across the natural sciences to imagine
and investigate research questions at the intersection
of geology, biology, and climate science that transcend
single disciplines. We seek to create a network that is
self-sustaining and constantly improving our ability to
answer these questions into the future. Our meeting

for a 4 years PhD stipend (Integrated PhD stipend).
The Integrated PhD stipend is only open for appoint-
ment with starting date 1 September 2022. The De-
partment consists of two sections with research and
teaching in Biotechnology, Chemistry, Chemical Engi-
neering, Environmental Technology and Biology. Place
of employment of the position is Section for Chemical
Science and Engineering in Aalborg. The Section of Bio-
science and Engineering consists of 90 people of which
about 30 is associate- and full professors. The section's
conducts internationally competitive research within a
range of topics within Biology and Biotechnology and
publishes more than 100 peer reviewed publications an-
nually. The section is responsible for the educations
in Biology, Biotechnology, Medical Biotechnology and
Environmental Science and is mostly located in Aalborg,
but also conducts research and teaching at Esbjerg Cam-
pus.
JOB DESCRIPTION
The PhD student will be working on a project entitled
\Integration of the Drosophila melanogaster Microbiome
and Transcriptome for Enhanced Prediction of Late-
Life Events" and will be positioned in the Bioscience
and Engineering section. The project is nanced by
the Independent Research Fund Denmark and will be
a collaborative eort between multiple researchers at
Aalborg University, Denmark and Clemson University,
South Carolina, USA.
The PhD student will be working on a panel of in-
bred and genome sequenced fruit y lines (Drosophila
Genomic Reference Panel) exposed to either a caloric-balanced or caloric-enriched diet. At multiple age-points
during the life of ies we will assess age-related decline
in locomotor activity. Whole-genome RNA transcrip-
tomic analysis and 16s rRNA quantication of the gut
microbiome will be performed on young ies from the
two environments. Using publicly available genotype
information of all lines and the generated transcriptomic
and microbiome data, we will develop models for pre-
diction of longevity and healthspan within and across
nutritional exposures.
We seek a candidate with a strong interest in experi-
mental work and analyses om omics data and who has
knowhow within one or more of the following areas:
molecular biology, bioinformatics, physiology, evolution-
ary biology, or quantitative genetics and genomics. The
project can to some extent be tailored to the candidate's
interests and expertise.
The PhD student is expected to engage in teaching
within genetics and evolutionary biology and will follow
courses according to the university's PhD program. As
part of the PhD study, it is expected that the candidate
spends 4-6 month abroad, likely in laboratories of our
collaborators at Clemson University.
Application:
The application must contain: (1) Cover letter of 1-2
pages describing the motivation for applying and an

Project: \Symbiont adaptation in response to host
shifts"
A majority of arthropod species harbour specialised
bacterial symbionts that may inuence many aspects
of arthropod biology, and are transmitted from moth-
ers to ospring (hence termed \inherited symbionts").
Occasionally, inherited symbionts are transmitted be-
tween unrelated individuals. Such host shifts are key
to symbiont spread and evolutionary success, yet this
process is poorly understood. The goal of the project
is to determine how symbionts evolve in adaptation to
novel hosts, and to ascertain the factors involved in
successful spread of inherited symbionts in novel hosts.
The project will employ the Spiroplasma / Drosophila
model, use articial host shifts to create novel host sym-
biont combinations, and investigate genomic evolution
of symbionts. Symbiont spread in host populations will
further be investigated using experimental evolution.
The work will thus comprise handling and manipulation
of Drosophila populations, as well as microbial genomics
and bioinformatics. The candidate will work in an in-
ternational research environment and will benet from
excellent laboratory infrastructure.

contract. Duration 3 years. Monthly net salary about

Thesis summary The variability of reproductive modes
is a long-standing conundrum in evolutionary biology.
Yet, it conditions the evolutionary trajectories of popu-
lations and the morphological or physiological charac-
teristics of the individuals that compose them. The phy-
topathogenic fungus Melampsora larici-populina, caus-
ing poplar rust, is particularly interesting for the study
of the polymorphism of reproduction modes. Indeed,
like most Pucciniales, this species presents a life cycle
that alternates between an asexual multiplication phase
and a sexual reproduction phase. Besides, we have
demonstrated that lineages of the fungus do survive
strictly asexually over decades.
The thesis proposes to address the issue of variability
in reproductive modes along three complementary axes:
1. An evolutionary ecology approach that will allow us
to determine the geographical distribution of the asexual
lineages of M. larici-populina using population genetics.
2- A phenotypic approach that will aim to experimen-
tally demonstrate the level of investment of asexual
lineages in sexual reproduction.
3- A genomic and evolutionary transcriptomic approach
that will aim to elucidate the functional basis of the
cycle and to nd the determinants of the variation of
the sexual and asexual reproduction modes.

5. excitement to perform research in an international

6. good level of spoken and written English
Project in brief:
As endotherms, mammals and birds have evolved the
capacity to thermoregulate, an evolutionary achieve-
ment with profound impact on biology and ecology.
Endothermy, however, does not necessarily entail a con-
stant body temperature throughout a day, a year or
a life time. Instead, many mammals are known to hi-
bernate seasonally or enter torpor, reducing their body
temperature by a few ^AoC to several tens of ^AoC be-low the normothermic level. Birds are known to also
become torpid or and reduce body temperature during
the night by rather a few ^AoC with some exceptions
of up to two tens of ^AoC. These on rst sight small
temperature drops may, however, have profound eects
on enzymatic activity. The rate of biochemical reactions
in general, and enzymatic reactions in particular are
highly temperature dependent, which also applies to
enzymes that act as antioxidants against free radicals.
They protect against the negative eects of oxidative
stress through free radical scavenging and if this protec-
tive enzymatic action is reduced in its rate, free radicals
may remain unchecked and lead to oxidative damage of
biomolecules. Such oxidative damage risks functional
integrity of biomolecules and is currently one of the
most frequently forwarded driver of aging. Our research
is designed to understand how regulation of body tem-
perature may be hampered by increasing age and how
this impaired thermoregulatory capability may lead to
increased oxidative stress when animals grow old.
While it is well established for mammals, including us
humans, that body temperature and the capacity to
thermoregulate declines with increasing age, such data
are virtually absent for birds, and in addition were never
linked to oxidative stress. Our research project will pro-
vide thorough understanding how age in the context of
senescence inuences thermoregulation in birds. The
second goal of our research is then to relate the ther-
mogenic capacity of birds of dierent age to oxidative
stress to test the hypothesis that body temperature is
related to the rate of oxidative damage.

Expression of interest: PhD scholarship behavioural
adaptation to climate change in fairy-wrens
I'm looking for outstandingcandidates who wish to ap-
ply for a competitive PhD scholarship at James Cook
University (Townsville, Australia) to study topics re-
lated to behavioural adaptation to climate change using
fairy-wrens as a study system. The project involves a
combination of eldwork in south-west Australia with
analyses of long-term datasets.
Summary: It has been suggested that social species have
evolved in harsh environmental conditions, allowing for
successful reproduction and survival in environments
where pairs alone cannot succeed. This implies that
social behaviour may buer against adverse weather
conditions. However, an overlooked issue is that social
behaviour itself will also be aected by adverse weather.
This project will study the dynamic interplay between
ecological conditions and social behaviour through new
experiments and detailed behavioural observations using
an iconic Australian bird as a model system.
You need to be eligible to apply for an (International)

ground information: The recruitment concerns Polish
National Science Center project - summary of the project
idea:
https://www.ncn.gov.pl/sites/default/les/listy-
rankingowe/2021-09-15okipi34a/streszczenia/538567-
pl.pdf Maintaining biodiversity is one of the most
important problems of our time and forests are
particularly aected by human activities because they
are used for timber production. At the same time, wood
is a microhabitat that is home for numerous organisms
called saproxylics. The availability, quality and quantity
of deadwood in many forests are severely limited what
forces many species to live only in some remnants ofnatural forests. Other saproxylic organisms benet
from forest management and some of them might even
be detrimental to forestry, especially during outbreaks.
For proper protection of rare and threatened taxa, and
for eective management of eruptive species (called
'pests'), it is necessary to understand what determines
the viability and structure of their populations. Thanks
to the development of modern DNA sequencing and
genotyping techniques, it is now possible to study
genetic polymorphism in detail to understand the
factors and microevolutionary processes that shape
population structure. The addition of environmental
features to genetic data (via landscape genetics) makes
it possible to nd answers to the question of which
features of the environment (e.g., availability and
connectivity of old-growth forests, quantity and quality
of deadwood, etc.) determine the genetic polymorphism
of saproxylic beetle populations. The main question to
be addressed in the project: In this project saproxylic
beetle species will be examined, both relicts of primeval
forests and common taxa (including those with eruptive
populations), with dierent species-specic traits (such
as phylogenetic and trophic relationships, habitat and
food specialization) to nd answers to the following
questions:
1) how genetic polymorphism of saproxylic beetles varies
in forests with dierent habitat quality and microhabitat
quantity? 2) how the duration of protection preserves
the high genetic variability of saproxylic beetle's popula-
tions? 3) how the spatial distribution of suitable patches
determines the dynamics of meta-populations of saprox-
ylic beetles? 4) how distance to refuges in old-growth
forests reduces genetic polymorphism of saproxylic bee-
tles? 5) how population genetics of saproxylic beetles are
inuenced by traits such as specialization, abundance,
and phylogeny?
Information on the methods/description of work: Se-
lected saproxylic beetle species will be sampled from
multiple sites in old-growth, protected and managed
forests. Sampling will focus on Polish forests, as there
are still primeval forests in this country known to be hot-
spots for relict for deadwood beetle species. The sam-
pled beetles will be genotyped using next-generation se-
quencing technology and modern bioinformatics, which
will allow the description of molecular polymorphism.
Next, we will combine the genetic data with information
on the environmental conditions of the sampled sites
and species-specic traits. The PhD student will be
involved mostly in laboratory (nucleid acids isolation,
DNA barcoding, genomic library preparation, sequenc-
ing), bioinformatics and statistics. Sample collection
and habitat measurements in the eld will be done in
cooperation with specialists.20 EvolDir July 1, 2022
Additional information (e.g., special requirements from
the student): Requirements: - an M.Sc. degree in bi-
ology, biotechnology or related elds; - strong interest
in use of molecular data in ecological and evolutionary
studies (experience in next generation sequencing, SNP
genotyping and bioinformatic analyses are welcome); -

ComputationalPhylogenetics
PhD Position in Computational Phylogenetics
I invite applications for one doctoral position in
computational-phylogenetics in my research group at the
GeoBio-Center of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at
(LMU), M unchen. The position is part of my ERC
Starting Grant \MacDrive". This is a research-only
PhD position funded for 3 years (no classes and teach-
ing required but possible). The starting date is exible
between 1st September 2022 and 1st September 2023.
This position focuses on computational research but I
strongly encourage applicants with a biological back-
ground too.
The Project MacDrive aims to test which factors drive
diversication rates, e.g., species-specic factors such
as body size, habitat and diet, versus external factors
such as the environment. To answer this question, we
will estimate several species-level phylogenies with ex-
tant species and fossil species. Additionally, we willdevelop new statistical methods to estimate these time-
calibrated phylogenies with fossil taxa based on both
molecular and morphological data, as well as new sta-
tistical methods for diversication rate estimation. The
methods will be integrated into our software RevBayes
(https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes).
In this part of the project MacDrive, you will be re-
sponsible for developing and testing new approaches to
estimate phylogenies for extant and fossil species from
morphological data. Methods for estimating phylogenies
from molecular data are currently much more mature
and tested than methods for morphological data. Specif-
ically, in this project we need to develop better models
and methods for correlated morphological character and
morphological clock models. Your work is focused on

MemorialU CaribbeanBiogeography
I am seeking a motivated PhD student to test the role
of dierent hypotheses (e.g. Cenozoic vicariance, over-
water dispersal, the GAARlandia colonization route,
in situ speciation) on the evolution and assembly of
Caribbean ora. The Caribbean is important to con-
serve because it is one of the world's top ve biodiversity
hotspots. We will compile divergence times and ances-
tral areas of Caribbean endemic plant lineages from
the literature or from our own analyses (dated phylo-
genetic trees and biogeographic modeling). With these
data we will estimate colonization and speciation rates
through time. We hypothesize that dierent speciation
rates through time could explain the absence of a time-
for-speciation eect in the Caribbean as we previously
demonstrated, and a decreased colonization rate intothe Caribbean because islands will reach carrying ca-
pacity with time. In addition, the systematics of the
genus Copernicia (Arecaceae), a radiation of 21 palm
species mostly endemic to Cuba, will be conducted using
Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS). The student will con-
duct eldwork in Cuba. We expect to nd phylogenetic
splits reecting the history of fragmentation and rejoin-
ing of Cuban paleo-archipelagos, and between Cuba and
Hispaniola. Other research questions of interest to the
student are welcome. The PhD student will work under
the mentorship of Dr. Julissa Roncal at Memorial Uni-
versity of Newfoundland in Canada, and will collaborate
with Raul Verdecia from Las Tunas University in Cuba
for the systematics of Copernicia.
Student's qualications: - A MS degree in a related
discipline (e.g. biology, botany, systematics, ecology,
molecular biology, bioinformatics) - Experience in organ-
ismic botany, phylogenetics and/or population genetics
analyses, biogeographic modeling, and bioinformatics is
highly desirable. - Excellent writing, analytical, orga-
nization and communication skills. Attention to detail.
- Written and oral prociency in English is mandatory
for international students. TOEFL or IELTS test is
required for admission to the university.
Position characteristics: Project start date is September
2022 or January 2023. The PhD program comprises
four years with an annual stipend of CAD $22,500 and
the possibility to obtain the Dean's Doctoral Award of
CAD $5,000 per year. The student is expected to teach
60 hours during the fall and winter semesters (Sept
through April) but not in the spring. The department
of Biology at Memorial University has 25 faculty mem-
bers and 74 graduate students. Memorial University is
Atlantic Canada's largest university oering a multicul-
tural environment. Screening will begin immediately
and will continue until the position is lled. Position

Doctoral Researcher (m-f-d)
on the project &ldquo;A comparative population ge-
nomic approach to address the eects of habitat loss
and fragmentation on South American Centris oil-
bees&rdquo;
The salary is according to national norms, i.e. 65% of
13 TV-L.
The project: Landscape fragmentation and habitat loss
are among the major threats to global bee diversity.
However, it is still not well understood if certain func-
tional traits render some bee species more vulnerable
to environmental change than others. We seek a highly
motivated PhD student to investigate whether South
American oil bees of the genus Centris that vary in
functional traits also dier in their population genomic
response to fragmentation and habitat loss. Moreover,
the PhD student will study the eects of such habitat dis-
turbances on Centris bee- oil plant-interactions as well as
on the ecosystem service of pollination. This will allow
to link habitat disturbance, population genomics, ecolog-
ically relevant traits, species interactions and ecosystem
services (pollination). The research work includes large
scale sampling of bees in Brazil (3-4 months), wholegenome sequencing to generate single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) data, landscape genomics, building
plant-pollinator networks and conducting pollination
experiments. The selected PhD candidate will work in
an ambitious international research team with modern
lab facilities.
Requirements:
MSc/Diploma in Biology or related subject Knowledge
on population genetics/genomics and SNP data Field
work experience (especially in collecting insects) Knowl-
edge on wild bee biology, using GIS, R and Linux is
an advantage but not mandatory Experience in speak-
ing and writing in English Knowledge of German and

ation represents the fastest known sustained rates of
speciation in vertebrates. The cichlid species-ock of
Lake Victoria is incredibly diverse phenotypically and
ecologically, and thus is an exciting and dynamic system
to study the processes underlying speciation, ecological
diversication, coexistence and extinction. You will be
working alongside group members who are focused on
various aspects of the evolution of this radiation such
as: ecology, morphology, taxonomy, paleolimnology, and
genomics.
Requirements: A background in molecular genetics. Ex-
perience with linux and coding in R and/or Python. Ex-
perience handling NGS data and bioinformatics. Prior
experience in morphometrics is desirable but not re-
quired. Ability to work independently but also syner-gistically with other group members is important. The

PolygenicAdaptationPleiotropy
Two PhD positions in theoretical and computational
genetics
We are looking for two PhD students for a collabo-
rative project between the groups of Prof. Joachim
Krug (Institute for Biological Physics) and Dr. Markus
Stetter (Institute for Plant Sciences) on the roles of
polygenic adaptation and pleiotropy in the evolution ofJuly 1, 2022 EvolDir 27
plant populations under changing environments. The
project combines analytic theory, simulations, and the
analysis of large-scale empirical data from dierent plant
species, and is part of the new Collaborative Research
Center TRR341 \Plant Ecological Genetics" funded by
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). The focus of
the project is the joint adjustment of multiple pheno-
typic traits, so-called adaptive trait syndromes, which
play an important role in ecological specialization.
PhD1 (Krug lab): The student will develop and study
analytical models for the adaptation of single and multi-
ple traits under dierent environmental scenarios. The
mathematical framework is based on Fisher's geometric
model (Hwang et al. 2018), which combines an additive
genotype-phenotype map with a nonlinear phenotype-
tness map displaying a unique optimal trait combi-
nation. The project is suitable for applicants with a
background in theoretical population genetics, theoreti-
cal physics or mathematics.
PhD2 (Stetter lab): The student will employ forward-
in-time simulations to study the adaptation of single
and multiple traits under dierent environmental sce-
narios. Building up on previous research (Stetter et
al 2018) you will apply these models to explicit plant
populations and compare them to empirical data. The
project is suitable for applicants with a background in
(theoretical) population genetics, quantitative genetics
or mathematics.
What we expect and what we oer: We are looking for
highly motivated individuals with a basic knowledge in
population and quantitative genetics, good computa-
tional skills, and a degree in biology, physics, mathe-
matics or computer science. Previous experience with
population genetic simulations is an asset but not a re-
quirement. Successful candidates will be integrated into
the newly established Graduate School in Ecological
Genetics (GEcoGen). Salary will be based on 65% of
the level E13 of the German public service salary scale

description
The quantitative genetic paradox of stasis, and its rele-
vance for sustainable pest control.
Pathogens provide some of the strongest selection pres-
sures in nature, driving continual dynamic coevolution-
ary interactions with their hosts. While such strong
selection might normally erode genetic variation, ge-
netic variation for resistance to pathogens is typically
high, because hosts can usually only resist a subset of
pathogens circulating in a population (i.e., pathogens
tend to show specicity in their ability to infect hosts).
As soon as particular pathogen strains or host genotypes
become prevalent, they experience negative frequency-
dependent selection that favours other strains or geno-
types, and thereby maintains genetic variation in the
wider population.
These phenomena are relevant for the sustainable use
of biopesticides, a welcome new technology that enlists
living organisms in the ght against crop pests. Syn-
thetic chemical pest control can be problematic because
it often conicts with other sustainable development
goals by damaging non-target organisms and disrupting
natural food webs. Moreover, despite intensive research
and development, insects continue to evolve resistance to
synthetic pesticides with predictable regularity, eluding
even the most ingenious attempts to prevent resistance
evolution.
The fact that insect pathogens rarely engender resistance
is therefore an alluring aspect on the side of biopesti-
cides. However, unlike natural enemies, industrially
produced biopesticides cannot coevolve with pests, and
most research and development has focussed intensely
on a small number of highly pathogenic strains. We
therefore urgently need to nd alternative ways to pre-
vent pest resistance to biopesticides.We have recently proposed an innovative and evolution-
arily sustainable approach to pest control that harnesses
rather than resists the enormous evolutionary potential
of pest populations. It relies on the observation that
strong pathogen-induced selection in nature does not
always produce evolutionary responses, the so-called
\paradox of stasis". The paradox can arise for multi-
ple reasons, including trade-os between characters or
across habitat patches, and it could conceivably allow
farmers to vary selection in subtle ways that preserve
genetic diversity

Fully funded PhD position in evolutionary genetics of
Drosophila-transposon interactions at the University of
Ulm, Germany.
Title - FlyInnovation - Are telomere specic retroele-
ments an innovative solution to the end-replication prob-
lem?
This PhD project in evolutionary insect genetics studies
potential conict and collaboration between transposons
and their Drosophila hosts. The position is funded for
three years as part of the project FlyInnovation at the
University of Ulm, Germany, and is part of the large in-
terdisciplinary DFG funded Priority Programme GEvol.Eukaryotes face a challenge: they must protect cod-
ing DNA from getting shorter with each round of cell
replication. Telomeres are a widespread solution to this
challenge. These repetitive DNA motifs cap chromo-
some ends and protect coding DNA. Because telomeres
and telomerase (the enzyme that maintains telomeres)
are vital to chromosome integrity they are highly evolu-
tionarily conserved. This makes the Diptera unusual '
ies have lost telomeric repeats and telomerase. Among
the Diptera, Drosophila are unique: they are the only
genus we know of where transposable elements (TEs)
are the sole means of maintaining chromosome ends.
These TEs act like telomerase, extending telomeric re-
gions by successive transposition. This system has been
heralded as a clear-cut example of TE domestication
but evidence in support of this idea is lacking. We will
unite theoretical and empirical approaches to determine
if telomere-specic TEs are an innovative means of pre-
serving chromosome ends in the absence of telomerase,
or selsh genetic elements avoiding host-silencing in a
genomic safe-site.
This project works alongside a theoretician who will
apply methods from ecology to model the evolution-
ary dynamics of TEs. This studentship will test these
models, and link TE abundance and diversity to phe-
notype to understand if TEs and hosts are cooperating,
or in conict. This will involve large scale laboratory
experimentation with multiple insect species, molecular
analyses (qPCRs, preparing samples for sequencing) and
cytological analyses (oligopainting and Fluorescence in
Situ Hybridization). The project will also entail analyz-
ing molecular data and phylogenetic analyses.
This PhD studentship is part of a collaborative project
with Dr. Pete Czuppon (University of M >1
2nster), work-
ing within the DFG funded Priority Programme GEvol.
The goal of GEvol is to collaboratively and interdisci-
plinarily exploit new computational and OMICS meth-
ods to reveal the history of genomes in the insect taxon
by comparative genomics. At the institute of Evolu-
tionary Ecology and Conservation Genomics, an inter-
active and international team studies diverse topics in
evolutionary ecology, including host-pathogen interac-
tions (Prof. Wilfert), insect evolutionary genetics and
metabolomics (Dr. Ruth Archer), conservation genomics
(Prof. Sommer) and pollinator ecology (Profs. Ayasse
and Tschapka), with the possibility to collaborate with
Prof. Niessing (Institute of Pharmaceutical Biotechnol-
ogy) on FISH analysis.
Applicants will possess a relevant Master degree in evo-
lutionary biology or a related eld of study. The suc-
cessful applicant should have expertise in the elds of
evolutionary ecology, genetics or evolutionary genomics.
Applicants should ideally have expertise in experimen-36 EvolDir July 1, 2022
tal quantitative genetics, molecular techniques and/or
bioinformatics. Experience in working with live insects
would be desirable. The successful applicant will be able
to work autonomously but also collaboratively and will
have excellent oral and written English language skills.
The position will be based at the University of Ulm,
at the Institute of Evolutionary Ecology and Conser-
vation Genomics. Ulm is a delightful historic city on
the Danube in Southwestern Germany; it is one hour
from the Alps, Lake Constance, Munich and Stuttgart.
Additionally, the position includes work in partner labs
in Cologne, Freiburg and Hannover.

AppliedEvolutionaryBiology
We are seeking a PhD student to join us (Prof. Anna
Lindholm & Dr. Andri Manser) in a research project at
the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environ-
mental Studies at the University of Zurich, Switzerland,
assessing the potential of a naturally occurring selsh
genetic element (called t haplotype) as a tool to control
invasive mouse pests on islands where they harm en-
demic wildlife. The t haplotype is a supergene in housemice with two seemingly ideal characteristics for pest
control. First, males that carry two copies of the gene
(t/t homozygotes) are completely sterile. Second, males
that carry only one copy of the t (+/t heterozygotes)
pass the gene on to 95% of their ospring rather than
the 50% expected under Mendelian inheritance (gene
drive), allowing the genetic propagation of the sterile t
in a population. Preliminary work suggests that sterile
t releases could oer a powerful, versatile, and humane
tool to eradicate target populations due to a lack of
fertile males. The aim of the project is to assess the
potential of the sterile t as a pest control tool from a
wide range of methodological angles.
What will you be doing?
The applicant will study the impact of sterile males on
ospring production in settings of increasing complexity,
from a laboratory experiment, to enclosure populations,
to releases into a semi-natural population where sterile
males have to integrate into a preexisting complex social
environment. Additionally, the applicant will have the
opportunity to contribute to analysis of relevant large
datasets, and/or modelling.
What are we looking for?
You are passionate about evolutionary biology and keen
to explore how evolutionary concepts could be applied
to solve a major practical problem. You enjoy working
with animals as well as designing and implementing ex-
periments to test your ideas. You are highly motivated,
collaborative and an excellent communicator, and have
a demonstrable desire to learn new skills. Experience
with animal experiments, data analysis, and modelling
will be viewed as a bonus. You bring a relevant MSc
degree or equivalent.
What we oer
The great majority of your time will be spent on re-
search. We oer excellent experimental facilities, great
collaborators, and strong support in developing your
scientic skills and abilities. Participation in teaching
activities, and taking classes, is part of your training.
The project has four years of funding, with a generous
salary. We provide a highly international largely English
speaking environment.
How to apply
Please submit applications as a single pdf le, including
a letter of motivation that highlights your interest in
and suitability for the project, your CV, and recom-
mendation letters or contact details of 2 references, by
email to Dr Anna Lindholm (anna.lindholm@ieu.uzh.ch).
Screening of applicants is ongoing and continues until
the end of July 2022. Starting date: Autumn 2022 (toJuly 1, 2022 EvolDir 37
be negotiated)

MolEcolPrize Nominations Jun06
DeadlineReminder
Nominations for the Molecular Ecology Prize: June 6th
deadline approaching!
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scien-
tic society, so there is no body that actively promotes
the discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial
board of the journalMolecular Ecologytherefore created
the Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void,
and recognize signicant contributions to this area of
research. The prize selection committee is independent
of the journal and its editorial board.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to molecular ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previous
winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf, Louis Bernatchez,
Nancy Moran, Robin Waples, Scott Edwards, Victoria
Sork, and Fuwen Wei.
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words (longer submissions
will not be accepted) and the candidate's CV directly to
Anne Yoder (anne.yoder@duke.edu) by Monday, June 6,
2022. Organized campaigns to submit multiple nomina-
tions for the same person are not necessary and can be
counterproductive. Also, note that nominations from
previous years do not roll over.

nomics. Interested candidates should please contact
jerey.d.jensen@asu.edu by June 30. The start date
is exible, and the position will have secure funding
from an NIH MIRA award. Lab research interests and

SpeciationGenomicsMadagascar
NSF-funded postdoc in speciation and/or computational
genomics THE POSITION: The Yoder Lab at Duke Uni-
versity seeks to hire a postdoctoral research associate
with skills in computational and speciation genomics.
You will become a member of a research team that takes
an integrative approach to speciation biology by combin-
ing computer science, eld ecology, and genomic analysis.
The project is a collaboration with Ziheng Yang (Univer-
sity College London; computational biology) and Marina
Blanco (Duke Lemur Center; behavioral eld ecology).
Starting annual salary will be $53,760, along with sched-58 EvolDir July 1, 2022
uled annual increases. Funding is available for up to four
years with renewal determined annually. The position
will remain open until lled. This is a reposting of the
position as it was being held until a hiring decision was
made for the initial candidate. He has indeed been hired
for his dream permanent job (congratulations to Jordi!),
so the search continues.
THE PROJECT: The project will focus on southeastern
Madagascar where habitat fragmentation is threatening
the survival of unique and irreplaceable biodiversity. In
addition to generating important new knowledge about
the processes that drive and delimit speciation, the
project will include training and mentorship of both
Malagasy and American students across a range of edu-
cational levels. The research focuses on mouse lemurs,
which are the world's smallest primates and are unique
to Madagascar and builds on current research that in-
dicates that they have experienced episodic bursts of
lineage diversication consistent with the climatic cycles
of the Pleistocene. Key outcomes of the collaborative
project will be the development of genomic data and
computational tools for identifying the magnitude, di-
rection, and rate of genetic exchange among lineages
as well as a unique understanding of the roles of ecol-
ogy, metabolism, and sensory communication play in
inhibiting reproduction among the targeted species. The
advertised postdoctoral position will be devoted to il-
luminating the role of genomic architecture in driving
and maintaining species boundaries.
ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY & GENOMIC RE-
SOURCES: Mouse lemurs are fascinating creatures of
special biological interest given that they are genetically
highly distinct though morphologically and ecologically
similar. Notoriously, their taxonomy has exploded
over the past 25 years, with more than 20 species
described since 1994. Mouse lemurs reach sexual
maturity within the rst year of life, and typically
reproduce annually within a highly constrained seasonal
timeframe that is often correlated with the duration of
a hibernation season. Female receptivity can be as short
as several hours in a given year. During the austral
winter, individuals of both sexes may enter periods
of inactivity, ranging in duration from hours (daily
torpor) to weeks (hibernation). The project will focus
on a region of Madagascar where ve distinct lineages,
currently described as species, occur in patterns of both
sympatry and allopatry. Divergence time analysis using
a pedigree-derived measure of the de novo mutation
rate (Campbell et al., 2021; Heredity) indicates that
they achieve reproductive isolation extremely rapidly
for a mammal which is a driving motivation for the
research (Poelstra et al., 2022; bioRxiv). The project
will benet from a number of existing genomic resourcesincluding a reference genome for one of the target
species (Larsen et al., 2017; BMC Genomics) as well
as a newly released transcriptomic cell atlas (The
Tabula Microcebus Consortium; bioRxiv). In-country
outreach activities will build upon previous eld-based
genomics and associated workshops (Blanco et al., 2020;
Conservation Genetics).
QUALIFICATIONS: Applicants should have a PhD in
evolutionary genetics/genomics and strong computa-
tional skills. We seek an independent and collaborative
scientist with an interest in team-based science and a
generous approach to student training across a range of
educational levels. Applicants should be familiar with
the latest developments in genome assembly, population-
level resequencing, and statistical analysis of population
genomic data. Experience with single-cell genomics is a
plus.
WORK ENVIRONMENT: Duke University is located
in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina. It
is a short drive from other top universities, including
UNC - Chapel Hill and NC State University, and has
rich programs in evolution, ecology, and genomics. The
region has diverse cultural resources and is conveniently
situated between the Appalachian Mountains to the
west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. As we like
to say: \turn right, and within 2.5 hours you can be
hiking in the Smokies; turn left, and in 2.5 hours you
can be lounging on some of the world's most beautiful
beaches." The Yoder Lab welcomes individuals of all
identities and backgrounds. We believe that the best
science comes from an environment that includes

EvolutionaryGenomics
As part of a maternity leave replacement, a 4-month
postdoc position in evolutionary genomics is available
at the Weber Lab, Department of Aquatic Ecology,
Eawag, Switzerland. The Weber Lab focuses on adap-
tation and conservation genomics of freshwater inver-
tebrates (https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/eco/-
main-focus/adaptation-conservation-genomics/).July 1, 2022 EvolDir 59
Genomic and epigenomic data are available for analysis
in two dierent projects: 1) Epigenomics of pollution
in natural populations Whole-epigenome (MethylSeq)
sequencing data of populations from polluted and unpol-
luted localities are available for two widespread invasive
species: the Asian clam (Corbicula uminea) and the
Zebra mussel (Deissena polymorpha). The aim of this
project is to compare the methylomes of populations
from dierent habitats and dierent species from the
same habitat to uncover epigenetic signatures of adap-
tation to pollution. 2) Sex determination in invasive
mussels Whole-genome sequencing data of males and
females are available for two emblematic invasive species
of freshwater mussels: the Zebra mussel (Dreissena poly-
morpha) and the Quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis).
The aim of this project is to uncover if there is a ge-
netic sex determination system in these species and to
describe it (chromosome; extent of dierentiation; sex lo-
cus candidate). The postdoc can work on either project,
depending on interests and experience.
We are looking for an independent, motivated, recently
graduated postdoc (ideally less than 3 years) with a
PhD in evolutionary biology, genomics, bioinformatics

The Riddell Lab in the Department of Ecology, Evolu-
tion, and Organismal Biology at Iowa State University is
seeking to hire a postdoctoral researcher with an exper-
tise in avian physiology, ecology, and/or evolution. The
postdoc will be hired to study the ecology and evolution
of birds through the lens of physiology and will work
directly with Dr. Eric Riddell. We are open to dierent
types of backgrounds and interests, but we are hoping
for a postdoc with experience in any of the following
areas: physiology, ecology, and evolution of birds, cod-
ing in R or Python, biophysics, phylogenetic analyses,
eld experience, or species distribution modeling. The
position is for 2 years, with annual reappointment.
The postdoc will contribute to multiple ongoing projects
in the lab, including exciting datasets on feather re-
ectance that are ready to be published. In addition,
the postdoc will assist in a long-term monitoring project
of a tree swallow population in Ames, IA.

LMU Munich PaleoPhylogenetics
2 Postdoc/PhD Positions in Paleo-Phylogenetics
I invite applications for two postdoctoral or doctoral po-
sitions in paleo-phylogenetics in my research group at the
GeoBio-Center of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at
(LMU), M unchen. The positions are part of my ERC
Starting Grant \MacDrive". The positions are tem-
porary research positions for 4 years (no classes and
teaching required but possible). The starting date is
exible between 1st September 2022 and 1st Septem-
ber 2023. For these two positions, I invite applications
for both postdoctoral and PhD level. I am specically
looking for applicants with a taxonomic background to
complement the existing expertise in my group.
The Project MacDrive aims to test which factors drive
diversication rates, e.g., species-specic factors such
as body size, habitat and diet, versus external factors
such as the environment. To answer this question, we
will estimate several species-level phylogenies with ex-
tant species and fossil species. Additionally, we will
develop new statistical methods to estimate these time-
calibrated phylogenies with fossil taxa based on both
molecular and morphological data, as well as new sta-
tistical methods for diversication rate estimation. The
methods will be integrated into our software RevBayes
(https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes).
In this part of the project MacDrive, you will be re-
sponsible for estimating a time-calibrated phylogeny of
two of these four groups: Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla,
Squaliformes and Crocodyliformes. Since there are two
positions, all four groups should be covered although
similar groups for additional case studies can be ex-
plored. The goal is to build a dataset that includes
up to 75% of known fossil species. You will be respon-
sible for building the morphological dataset, which is
likely to include collecting the data from the primaryJuly 1, 2022 EvolDir 65
sources. Then, you will be responsible for performing
the phylogenetic analysis to estimate the time-calibrated
phylogenies. During the project MacDrive, we will de-
velop new approaches to estimate phylogenies for such
datasets (done by another PhD student) and you will
get the opportunity to contribute to this method de-
velopment (e.g., testing these new methods on your
data). Once these phylogenies are available, you will
perform macroevolutionary analyses to test for drivers
of diversication rates. The necessary skills to perform
the phylogenetic and macroevolutionary analyses can
be learnt during this project. Ideally, we will be able to
identify common patterns shared across all study groups,
such as the impact of mass extinction or the environ-
ment vs species-specic factors. This part of the project
is in collaboration with Graham Slater (University of
Chicago) besides our large group of local collaborators
in Munich.
Applicants should have a PhD degree (if applying for
the postdoctoral position) or a Master's degree (if ap-
plying for the PhD position), completed or completion
imminent, in paleontology, zoology, evolutionary biology
or a related eld. The key skills required are taxonomic
expertise of the study groups and good communication
skills (oral and written English). Basic knowledge in
phylogenetics, macroevolutionary analysis and statisti-
cal inference (especially R and Bayesian statistics) is
benecial but not required. Training in these skills will
be provided depending on need. No knowledge of Ger-
man is required but some basic knowledge will be helpful
outside of work. Enthusiasm, determination and the
capacity to work independently are essential. The candi-
date is highly encouraged to develop their own research
ideas complementing the current research direction.
My group is broadly working on theory and compu-
tational methods for Bayesian inference of phylogeny
(https://hoehnalab.github.io). Our research directions
include phylogeny inference, divergence time estimation,
diversication rate estimation and model testing. All
of our methods are implemented in the open-source
program RevBayes (http://www.RevBayes.com) which
is the successor software of the popular program Mr-
Bayes. The successful applicant will be part of our
vibrant RevBayes group. There will be opportunities
for the successful applicant to work with and visit the
research groups of my collaborators in Europe and the
USA. Furthermore, I expect the candidate to become
actively involved in our RevBayes workshops as a lecture
or teaching assistant.
My group is located at the GeoBio-Center of the LMU
Munich, one of Germany's and Europe's top Univer-
sities (#32 world-wide; #8 in Europe; #1 in Ger-
many; https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/lmu-munich). The GeoBio-Center

intra- and inter-specic data.
This work will be based on the theoretical work by Kaj &

EvolComparativeGenomicsTicks
Post-doctoral position (18 months) to work on the com-
parative and evolutionary genomics of ticks.
Starting date: September 1st, 2022. Applications are
possible until July, 8th, 2022, or until the position is
lled.
Context: Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods that repre-
sent a signicant health concern for humans and domes-
tic animals due to the potential transmission of bacterial
pathogens and parasites. Emerging knowledge on tick
genomics (Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016, Nat. Comm., Jia et al.
2022, Cell) is beginning to help understand the specics
of tick genomes and the genetic bases for some of the
unique history traits of ticks. In this context, our group
(INRAE, Nantes, France), through a partnership with
the Genoscope (CEA, Evry, France) has sequenced the
genomes of four species of the genus Ixodes, includingIxodes ricinus, which is a widespread, wide host range,
and potentially problematic species, being the vector of
Lyme disease in Europe.
Project: The post-doc will lead the comparative ge-
nomics studies of the four genomes produced by our col-
laboration with Genoscope (the four annotated genomes
are already available), and also publicly available
genomes produced by other research groups. Its main
mission will be to study the evolutionary dynamics of
tick genomes, with a focus on the genus Ixodes: identi-
cation of gene expansions/contractions and association
with specic functions, patterns of gene order conser-
vation, detection of events of horizontal gene transfers,
evaluation of evolutionary rates and atypical patterns
(positive selection). In addition, depending on skills and
time, a populational study of genetic variation, at the
genome (or exome) level, can be considered.
Location: the position is available for 18 months starting
from September 2022, at the BIOEPAR lab in Nantes,
in the TIBODI group, a team of 5 searchers and 3 tech-
nicians working on ticks and tick-borne diseases. Nantes
is a vibrant city on the French west coast, known for
its quality of life. The post-doctoral searcher will work
closely with Claude Rispe (PI), while interactions will
be pursued with the Genoscope and with bioinformati-
cians of BIPAA (a platform that manages arthropod
genomes of agronomical importance, in Rennes).
Candidate: - PhD or previous post-doc in the eld of
comparative/evolutionary genomics, - Skills/experience
in phylogenetic analyses, evolutionary rates, evolution
of gene repertoires, - Skills in bioinformatics tools and
scripting (bash, R, python or perl), - Excellent abilities
in data analyses, writing of scientic papers, communi-
cation, teamwork.
Monthly net salary: between 1905 euro and 2346 euro
, depending on experience (duration of research time
post-thesis).
All applications must be sent by email to Claude Rispe
(claude.rispe@inrae.fr). Please include a CV, explain
the motivations of your application and your adequacy
with the description of the position. The names and
email addresses of at least two referees are required.
The documents must be in pdf format, fused in a single
le, and can be written in French or English.

Modeling Gene Drives for Controling Mosquito-Borne
Infections
We are looking to hire two postdocs to work on an NIH-
funded project on modeling gene drives for controlling
infections transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
BACKGROUND: Interest in using genetically-altered
mosquitoes to combat mosquito-borne infections has
grown rapidly in the wake of recent development of
CRISPR-based gene editing technology. Gene drives
can be used to spread specic transgenes into a mosquito
population either to reduce its size or to render it unable
to transmit a particular pathogen. In some situations,
uncontrolled spread of a drive could be a concern, so
there is interest in developing drives that are temporally
or spatially limited.
OUR WORK: Our group uses modeling techniques to
explore the likelihood of success of dierent approaches.
We use a range of models, from simple through to com-
plex, in order to understand the dynamics of proposed
drives and how various biological complexities (such as
density dependent population dynamics, spatial struc-
ture and mating behavior) will impact gene drive-based
control.
Our most detailed model simulates the spatial popula-
tion dynamics and population genetics of Ae. aegypti
in a city, Iquitos, in the Amazonian region of Peru.
There are rich data sets on both mosquito dynamics and
dengue epidemiology that have been collected in this
city. One important characteristic of this mosquito is
limited among-house movement and strong population
structure.
JOB DESCRIPTIONS: We are looking for applicants
with a solid background in population biology and pop-
ulation genetics who have experience with modeling and
who want to do applied research. We have some exi-
bility in these positions, but ideally would like to hire
one person who would work on conceptualizing novel
drive strategies and another who would focus more on
exploring the success of drives in ecologically-rich mod-
els. For the second position, experience with C++ or
related languages would be desirable. For both positions,
the ability to work independently and to communicate
eectively as a member of a team is essential.Our project is strengthened by collaborations with a
number of labs in the US and in Peru, and activity
in the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at NC
State that examines societal aspects of novel genetic
technologies. The postdocs will interact with members
of these other research groups. If desired, there will be
an opportunity for some work in Peru and for mentoring
undergraduate and graduate students. The appointment
is for two-years with the potential to write new grants
for extension beyond that period.

Paris MicroalgaeAdaptations
A postdoctoral position is available for 24 months the
project is funded to study the genetic innovations in
photosynthetic-related activities in diatoms. Flexible
start between January and March 2023, in the heart
of Paris at Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, in
the team Evolution of Photosynthetic Functions and
Genome Dynamics in Microalgae of the Laboratory of
Chloroplast Biology and Light-sensing in Microalgae
http://www.ibpc.fr/UMR7141. The post-doctoral as-
sociate will benet from the environment of experts in
sequence analysis and genome evolution, diatoms biol-
ogy and functional genomics, chloroplast biology and
photosynthesis, which should allow him/her to imagine
and design new experiments as she/he progresses in thisresearch project.
Requirements: - PhD in the eld of compara-
tive/evolutionary genomics
- Skills/experience in phylogenomics, molecular evolu-
tion, evolution of gene repertoires
- Strong skills in programming and statistics
- Excellent abilities in data analyses, writing of scientic
papers, communication, teamwork.
Keywords : Comparative genomics; endosymbiosis; ge-
netic innovations Description
Diatoms are the world's most diverse group of algae,
comprising at least 100,000 species. Found in many dif-
ferent aquatic zones (marine and freshwater ecosystems,
intertidal ats, soil, glacier and sea-ice ^A), these algae
would be responsible for about 20% of the global carbon
xation and oxygen production on earth. Evolutionar-
ily, diatoms are only distantly related to green algae
and plants (Archaeplastida). Whilst these latter organ-
isms are derived from the primary endosymbiosis of a
cyanobacterium into an heterotrophic protist, diatoms
and related organisms within the Stramenopila group,
are derived from a secondary endosymbiosis, involving
the capture of at least a red alga and green algae by
another eukaryote (Falciatore et al., Plant Cell 2020).
Diatoms therefore display distinctive genomic, cellular
and metabolic features compared to organisms of the
green lineages and appear particularly suited from an
evolutionary point of view to study the dynamics of
intracellular genomes communication, and the genetic
determinants of photosynthetic adaptation to dierent
aquatic lifestyles.
This in silico project aims at shedding light on the ge-
netics innovations of diatoms with regard to chloroplast
functions, either in its biogenesis or in its metabolic
activities. In the context of secondary endosymbiosis,
paradigms established for Archaeplastida need to be
revisited, in particular as regards (i) intracellular trans-
port of proteins and metabolites between the cytosol
and the chloroplast and (ii) the coordination of gene ex-
pression between the nucleo-cytosol and the chloroplast.
Addressing these questions requires a comprehensive ex-
ploration and identication of chloroplast-targeted pro-
teins or whose expression prole correlates with those
of known chloroplast genes in diatoms. The focus will
be made on genes possibly involved in the regulation
of diatom chloroplast gene expression and those genes
that are likely specic of the new genetic context of
secondary endosymbiosis, among which should be a sub-
class that arose de novo in diatoms, i.e. from previously
non-coding sequences.72 EvolDir July 1, 2022
For this aim, the post-doctoral associate will perform
comparative genomics analysis to exploit the ~10 com-
plete genomes of diatoms already published and addi-
tional genomic resources, soon available, from the 100
diatoms project consortium, from which the host lab is a
member. He/she also will have access to transcriptomics
and proteomics data and resources generated in the host
laboratory (e.g, DiatOmicBase platform to mine diatom
omics data) and publicly available data such as the
MMETSP- Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome
Sequencing Project (Keeling et al. Plos Biol 2014) and
metadata of the Tara Ocean project (Carradec et al.,
Nat comm. 2018).

CropDomesticationGenomics
We have an exciting opportunity for a Post Doc to work
on the NERC funded project \Evolutionary dynamics of
vegetative agriculture in the Ethiopian Highlands: inte-
grating archaeobotanical and genomic science" (https://-
gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FW005689%2F1). You
will work with Dr James Borrell and Dr Philippa Ryan
at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in collaboration with
Prof Dorian Fuller at the Institute of Archaeology, Uni-
versity College London.
Enset is a giant perennial herb that provides the sta-
ple food for 20 million people, but outside of Ethiopia,
this remarkable banana relative is virtually unknown.
Like many tropical clonal crops, which tend to preserve
poorly in the archaeological record, enset's domestica-
tion history is poorly understood. Yet today we observeover a thousand unique landraces, many with traits
specialised for disease tolerance, taste, co-products and
other useful attributes.
The successful applicant will make a major contribution
to understanding how farmers selected and cultivated
this diversity, and over what time period, helping to
unravel the mystery of enset domestication. This has
signicant applications in supporting the adaptation of
enset and other clonal crops to climate change. The
successful applicant will also form part of a vibrant,
dynamic and cross disciplinary scientic environment,
with access to Kew's state-of-the-art laboratory facilities
and opportunities to develop professional skills for the
next stage of their career. This role coincides with a
major new collaboration between Kew and the UCL
Institute of Archaeology as we apply novel approaches
combining genomics and archeobotany.
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in genomics or
a related discipline, together with a strong interest in
crop evolution and domestication and a track record of
research publications commensurate with their career
stage. They will be excited at the opportunity to inte-
grate archeobotanical evidence (e.g. phytoliths, macro
remains) from sites across the Ethiopian highlands, to-
gether with environmental and cultural diversity data
to help parameterise genomic models. They will also be
condent with developing novel methodologies, bioinfor-
matic analysis, data management and communicating
their research through publications and conferences. We
particularly welcome applicants that wish to contribute
their own ideas and help to shape our research direction.
For informal enquiries please contact Dr James
Borrell (j.borrell@kew.org) or Dr Phillipa Ryan
(p.ryan@kew.org).
This role is based at Kew with the option of regular
home working, subject to operational requirements.
The salary will be pounds 34,933 per annum (pro rata).

AncientSedimentaryDNA
Open call for a post-doctoral researcher on ancient sedi-
mentary DNA
Interested in studying our evolutionary past using an-
cient DNA recovered from sediments?
We are looking for a motivated post-doctoral researcher
to develop computational approaches for the analysis of
ancient hominin DNA extracted from sediments
Project description:
In this project, we plan to develop analytical pipelines
to the study of ancient hominin nuclear DNA retrieved
from sediment samples, and apply them to samples of
interest, in order to address questions pertaining to our
evolutionary history in novel ways.
The project is a collaboration between the Moorjani
lab (https://moorjanilab.org/) at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Berkeley, and the Slon lab (www.slonlab.com)
at the University of Tel Aviv, Israel, and will involve
exchange of ideas and travel between the two labs.
The Moorjani lab focuses on using statistical and com-
putational approaches to study questions in human ge-
netics and evolutionary biology. A central aim in the lab
is to understand the impact of evolutionary history on
genetic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
The Slon lab studies the genetic makeup of prehistoric
and proto-historic populations, by implementing and
pursuing the development of state-of-the-art methodol-
ogy suited to face the challenges of DNA preservation
over time. One main focus of the laboratory is the
recovery of ancient DNA from sediments deposited at
archaeological sites - as doing so provides the possibility76 EvolDir July 1, 2022
to study the genomes of ancient humans even in the
absence of their physical remains, and to study the en-
vironment in which they lived. We strive to develop
laboratory and analytical techniques to improve the
usability of sediments as a source of paleo-genetic data.
Required qualications:
- PhD in biology, computational sciences, genomics, pop-
ulation genetics, or a related eld
- Experience with programming (in C, Python, R, or
language of your choice) and data analysis
- Experience working with ancient DNA is an advantage,
but not required.
Timelines and contract:
The position will be fully-funded for a minimum of two
years. Starting date is exible, and the position will
remain open until lled. The chosen applicant will be
hired through the Slon lab at Tel Aviv University.
The Slon Lab at Tel Aviv University is part of the
Departments of Anatomy and Anthropology and of
Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry at the
Sackler Faculty of Medicine; and is aliated with the
interdisciplinary Dan David Center for Human Evolu-
tion and Biohistory Research. Tel Aviv University is
the largest research university in Israel, with world-class
researchers across the spectrum of science, humanities
and art studying all aspects of the human past. Tel
Aviv itself is a lively beachside city.
Interested?

The Postdoctoral/Project Researcher will participate in
experimental research that aims to clarify the mecha-
nisms of cryptic female choice in humans. Depending
on the expertise of the researcher your^ a emain responsi-
bilities^ a ecan include e.g.:
* Clarifying molecular (RNA, DNA, or protein) level
mechanisms of cryptic female choice, * Conducting
sperm chemotaxis/selection (cryptic female choice) as-
says, * Phenotypic measurements (e.g. motility, mor-
phology and DNA integrity) of ^ a' and ^ a-selected' sperm,
or * Identication of candidate genes for male female
reproductive incompatibility and cryptic female choice
from genomic databases.
Fertilization is one of the most complex and enigmatic
biological processes, which severely hinders our under-
standing about reproduction, evolution and beginning of
life. It has traditionally been assumed that fertilization
is a completely unbiased process, leading to random
fusion of gametes. Against this assumption, our recent
ndings have indicated that gametes often combine non-
randomly, which bias fertilization towards particular
(compatible) reproductive partners (see e.g. https:/-
/doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.0836 and https://doi.org/-
10.1098/rspb.2020.1682). However, the molecular-level
mechanisms of such gamete-level sexual selection have
remained unclear. The primary aim of our research is to
clarify these mechanisms in humans and this way also
gain better understanding of the mechanistic basis of
fertilization and infertility (see https://doi.org/10.1093/-
humrep/deab221).

nomics/bioinformatics/behaviour
University of Lausanne, Department of Ecology and
Evolution
We are looking for PhD students and postdoctoral re-
searchers to work on three lines of research: 1. Evolu-
tionary comparative genomics. We have sequenced and
generated RNAseq data for queens and workers of ca.
80 ant species (Romiguier et al. 2022 Current Biology).
These data are available for a range of analyses related to
social evolution and the study of the genetic regulations
of dierences between castes. 2. Ant evolutionary ge-
nomics. We previously identied a supergene controlling
social organization in the re ant Solenopsis invicta. We
recently sequenced ve closely-related species and found
that the same genomic element also controls variation
in social organization in these species. Our next goal is
to use bioinformatic tools to study how this large non-
recombining region has evolved. 3. Ant behaviour. To
study the evolution of division of labour, we use a newly-
developed automated behavioural tracking system. This
system can reliably track the position, behaviour andinteractions of hundreds of ants many times per second
over multiple months. We have also developed a robotic
system which allows targeted interaction with individual
ants within the tracking system. We are also developing
an automated behavioural quantication system based
on body pose estimation of the ants which, together
with deep learning methods, will yield large scale data
on several types of behaviour-types.
These positions are funded by ERC and Swiss NSF
grants. Other projects on social behaviour are also pos-
sible if they t the research interests of our group: http:/-

Fraser River Salmon (see Executive Project Summary:
https://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/evsc/PDFs/-
Employment/Executive%20Project%20Summary.pdf
). The landslide blocked the Fraser River to salmon
passage, potentially having signicant impacts to
salmon populations in the Northern Basin. The project
is led by a large group of multi-disciplinary investigators
from Simon Fraser University, University of Northern
British Columbia, University of Victoria, Durham
University, and University of Massachusetts-Amherst,
working in collaboration with the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Hakai Institute, Fraser
Basin Council, and the Fraser Salmon ManagementCouncil.
We seek a candidate who can lead research on the fol-
lowing topic:
Genetic selection by hydraulic barriers. The post-doc
will lead molecular genetics work to prepare hundreds of
Pacic salmon samples for whole genome resequencing.
They will also lead bioinformatic analyses that use the
resulting sequence data. The goal of this work is to
understand the eect landslides may have had on popu-
lation genetic composition of sites above the landslide,
and to nd specic alleles that may have been selected
for or against from this migration blockage.
The PDF will be part of a larger cluster of post-docs
and research sta appointed at Simon Fraser University
investigating the impacts of landslides and ow dynam-
ics on salmon migration and evolution. Other PDFs
on the project will lead research on i) The chronology
of landslides in the Fraser Basin; ii) Linkages between
bedrock canyon geometry and landslide susceptibility;
iii) Flow dynamics in bedrock canyons; iv) Linkages
between ow dynamics and sh migration; and v) Fish
migration and hydraulic barriers.
Funding is available for one year with a possible exten-
sion for up to three years. Candidates should have
experience with molecular genetics, genomics, next-
generation sequencing data, and bioinformatics. The
project provides opportunities for candidates to gain
experience working at the intersection of genomics, evo-
lutionary biology, salmon ecology and life history, and
geomorphology, within a large group of 15 research col-
laborators. With this comes additional opportunities
to mentor graduate students, lead presentations and
discussions within a variety of settings and platforms,
and gain experience communicating complex science
with real-world implications.

Systematics and Evolution of Marine Invertebrates
Time and place: Sep. 26, 2022-Oct. 7, 2022 5:00, Bio-
logical Institute (BIO), University of Bergen
Course scope: Systematics and Evolution of Marine In-
vertebrates is a voyage through the tree-of-life of meta-
zoans oering a comprehensive overview of the diversity
of invertebrate phyla, morphological traits, and latest
hypotheses of evolutionary relationships based on molec-
ular phylogenetics. A suit of laboratory activities gives
students a truly hands-on experience and opportunity
to explore the morphology of a large ensemble of major
representatives of the Animal Kingdom, through the
observation of life and preserved specimens, anatomi-
cal dissections, interpretation of anatomical slides, and
optical microscopy.

ABOUT THIS COURSE
This community analytics course is designed for students
who have recently started their projects or researchers
who are starting using the R ecosystem. During this
three-day course, we will cover the basic concepts of
multivariate analysis and their implementation in R.
This course is a complement to the PR Statistic oering
allowing also beginners and non-programmers to dis-
cover the statistical tools needed to analyze an ecological
dataset in research, natural resource management or
conservation context. This course is not geared toward
any particular taxonomic group or ecological system.
We will cover diversity indices, distance measures and
multivariate distance-based methods, clustering, classi-
cation, and ordination techniques. We will focus on
the concept of the methods and their implementation
on R using dierent R packages. We will use real-world
examples to implement analyses, such as describing pat-
terns along gradients of environmental or anthropogenic
disturbances, quantifying the eects of continuous and
discrete predictors, data mining. The course will consist
of lectures, work on R code scripts, and exercises for
participants.

Online SeascapeGenomicsInR
Nov31-Oct4
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 3rd edition of the
Physalia course on \Seascape Genomics", which will
take place ONLINE from October 31st to November
4th.
Instructors: Dr. Laura Benestan (CEFE-CNRS, FR)
and Oliver Selmoni (EPFL, CH).
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course70/ )
In this course, students will learn the basics of this ap-
proach and train using state-of-the-art methods. Firstly,
students will learn how to extract environmental data
from publicly available databases and how to use it to
characterize the seascape structure and conditions. For
instance, students will learn how to use remote sensing
data to describe seawater temperature oscillations or
seawater movements. Next, the course will focus on
genomic analyses: students will learn how to evaluate
genetic structures in the marine environment and calcu-
late and display connectivity between populations. The
combination of environmental and genomic data will
also lead to the study of local adaptation. Students
will learn dierent methods to discover genetic/genomic
signatures potentially involved in adaptation against
specic environmental constraints. The course will also
cover the critical task of the interpretation and valida-
tion of the results, particularly in an applied conserva-
tion and management context. Finally, the workshop
will consider the crucial aspects and good habits to ac-94 EvolDir July 1, 2022

TransposableElementDetection
Oct3-7
Dear colleagues,
Registration is open for the course Introduction to
Transposable element detection using sequencing data
- 2nd edition. This course will be held live online (syn-
chronous). Max 20 participants.
Dates: October 3rd-7th, 2022
Instructor: Dr. Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier (Institut des
Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier, France) & Dr.
Emmanuelle Lerat (Universit >1
2Lyon 1, France)
COURSE OVERVIEW
Transposable elements (TEs) can be major components
of eukaryotic genomes. Such repeated sequences, which
can make up very large proportions like about 50% of
mammalian genomes to more than 80% in the genomes
of some plants, can promote various types of muta-
tions, from gene interruption and expression alteration
to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. They can
also promote the formation of new genes. Despite their
deleterious eects, TEs are currently considered as ma-
jor actors in genome evolution due the genetic and
epigenetic diversity they can generate.
Even if they have a fundamental biological role, detec-
tion and analysis of TE sequences are still technologi-
cally challenging. The length and quality of sequenced
reads make their detection and annotation dicult (40%
detection error). Moreover, the presence of TEs in a
genome can also lead to important assembly errors due
to rearrangement and the merge of repeats, and to di-culties in the identication of splicing events and in the
estimation of gene expression in transcriptomic analy-
ses. It is thus important to be able to identify these
sequences in genomic and transcriptomic data.
Since several years, a large number of bioinformatic tools
have been developed allowing a better identication of
TEs in genomes. New tools are released regularly to
follow the progress of sequencing technologies but also
to answer particular biological questions allowing to go
from the TE annotation in assembled or unassembled
genomes, to insertion polymorphism detection in natu-
ral populations. The result is a particularly large choice
for users leading to diculties in the determination of
the best tool(s) to use according to the case.
In this course, we aim at proposing an introduction of
selected bioinformatic tools for the detection and analy-
sis of TEs in genomic data (RepeatMasker, DnaPipeTE,
T-lex).

Methods and Software for Analysing Complex Trait
GWAS Data
Course Leaders
David Balding, Melbourne Integrative Genomics, Uni-
versity of Melbourne , Australia, and UCL Genetics
Institute, London.
Doug Speed, Center for Quantitative Genetics and Ge-
nomics, Aarhus University, Denmark.
Cost
GBP 90, which is currently about EUR 105. This in-
cludes lunch, refreshments and Eventbrite fees.
Course outline
This workshop will cover genome-wide association anal-
ysis, including latest developments in heritability analy-
ses, both using individual-level genetic data (e.g. GCTA
and LDAK software) and using summary statistics
(LDSC, SumHer). The workshop will also cover assess-
ing heritability enrichment in functionally-annotated
regions, genetic correlation and risk prediction (poly-
genic risk scores, BLUP and MultiBLUP). The common
elements of these methods will be emphasised, high-lighting a modelling framework that has emerged for
genome-wide SNP analysis, while also contrasting the
dierences in modelling assumptions underlying the dif-
ferent software.
The practicals will provide step-by-step details for
analysing genetic data, starting either with individual-
level data (e.g. PLINK les or the output from IM-
PUTE2) or summary statistics (p-values from a GWAS).
There will be worked examples; to take part in the prac-
ticals, participants should bring a laptop computer with
a recent version of R installed. LDAK and other scien-
tic software require the Linux Operating System, which
is available under MAC OS using Terminal.app, and
under Windows 10 or later using Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL), see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/windows/wsl/install Prerequisites
Participants should be procient in statistics including
maximum-likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing,
preferably some familiarity with random-eects regres-
sion models and experience of computer-based data
analysis. In genetics, knowledge of SNP genotyping and
Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibria will be assumed.
Computer scripts and output will be discussed that as-
sume some familiarity with scientic computing using
Linux. Some familiarity with PLINK would be helpful
but is not essential.

StockholmU EvolutionBehaviour
Aug3
Dear all,
We're organising a workshop in association with the
ISBE-meeting in Stockholm:
What is the inuence of personal experiences on un-
derstandings of sex dierences in behavioural ecology
research?
3 August 10-12:30 at Stockholm University.
As researchers, we all bring biases to our research ' by
our theoretical frameworks, our human senses (which
enable certain insights into animal behavior but hin-
der others), our study species, our geographic locations
and experiences. Accordingly, science historians and
philosophers have found connections between those who
have conducted science and the knowledge produced and
not produced. In this workshop, behavioural ecologist
Pietro Pollo will present his and Michael Kasumovic's
recent paper (2022) about the eect of the researchers'
experiences on their understanding of \sex roles". In
addition, evolutionary biologist and gender researcher
Malin Ah-King will present her research on how dierent
researchers' perspectives have contributed to shifting
perceptions about females in sexual selection research.
What can we learn from science philosophers about
these dierences in understandings and the development
in the eld? Given these diverging interpretations of
sex dierences and \sex roles", how should empirical
researchers in animal behaviour go about to increase
awareness and ameliorate handling of biases in this re-
search area?
In preparation for the workshop we will read two phi-
losophy of science papers.
This interdisciplinary workshop invites behavioral ecol-
ogy researchers and other researchers interested in this
topic. The workshop will take place at Stockholm Uni-
versity (location will be announced later), for those98 EvolDir July 1, 2022
who cannot be on site the talks will be available on
Zoom. Registration: please send an e-mail to Malin.Ah-
King@gender.su.se by June 30. Additional later regis-
trations will also be possible.

WashingtonDC UrbanEvo-EcoOmics
Nov4-5
We are pleased to announce the Society for Molecular
Biology and Evolution (SMBE) Satellite Workshop on
Urban Evolutionary and Ecological 'Omics in Washing-
ton, D.C., November 4-5, 2022.
This workshop will bring together individuals from the
rapidly growing eld of urban evolutionary ecology with
molecular and genome evolutionary biologists to share
perspectives on challenges and solutions at the inter-
section of these disciplines. As these elds grow, their
integration provides opportunities for shaping funding
initiatives and publications focused on how molecular
evolutionary \omics" (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics,
epigenomics) can shed light on the impact that our
growing urbanized world has on biodiversity and human
health.
This two day in-person workshop will bring together ~40July 1, 2022 EvolDir 99
individuals with brief introductory presentations and
rotating smaller break-out groups. The immediate goal
is to provide opportunities for open discussion across
diverse evolutionary sub-elds in outlining proposals
for multiple activities post-workshop, such as invited
symposia at international meetings and multi-authored
collaborative manuscripts in relevant journals.
Applications: Please ll out this Google survey
by July 1, 2022 (11 PM EST): https://forms.gle/-
UR7xXktJZm63odSZA In addition to general infor-
mation, the survey asks for a \statement of demon-
strated interest" relative to the goals of the workshop
(no more than 250 words). Specically, address how
you could personally contribute to discussions on how
molecular evolutionary \omics" research can shed light
on the impact that our growing urbanized world has on
biodiversity and human health.
Criteria: We will evaluate applications based on back-
ground in urban evolutionary ecology or molecular evo-
lutionary genetics/genomics, with a preference for a
demonstrated interest in both. The workshop will con-
sist of break-out and working groups, and preference
will be given to those who are able to join in person. We
will also look to maximize diversity across demography,
discipline, and career stage.Venue & Lodging: The Washington, D.C. area has easy
access via ights into three airports (Dulles, Reagan,
& Baltimore/Washington). The two day workshop will
take place at a hotel with conference space and lodging.
Ample food/beverage opportunities and a DC Metro
stop (which connects to the downtown National Mall
and airports) are in very close walking distance.
Funding: There is no registration fee. The organizing
committee plans to accommodate three nights of lodging
per person for those in need. In addition, we anticipate
providing funds to defray travel costs. The survey above
asks if you would require these funds to attend. We
ask that you please consider your need so that we can
maximize involvement.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.100 EvolDir July 1, 2022
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
