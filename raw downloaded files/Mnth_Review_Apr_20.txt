nia June 16-18, 2020
The time is approaching for the rst biennial meet-
ing of the North American Forest Genetics Society
(NAFGS) at the Asilomar Conference Center (https://-
treegenesdb.org/nafgsconference). A block of 125 beds
(single or double rooms) has been reserved at Asilomar
but once this is reached it may not be possible to enroll
for the meeting. Thus, it is timely to register for the
meeting and book your accommodation.
Aside from the program and eld trip shown at the
conference web site, there will be ample opportunity for
ad hoc groups to meet while at the conference. Asilomar
is a world class facility for this type of creative opportu-
nity. For example, see (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-
Asilomar Conference onRecombinant DNA), Asilomar
holds a very special place for an important moment in
the history of genetics/genomics research. So please
make your plans to attend the NAFGS conference and
make your contribution to the history of forest genetics
research in North America. We encourage everyone to be
a member of the NAFGS and there are no membership
fees (https://treegenesdb.org/user/registermulti/step1).

Due to uncertainties regarding COVID19, we plan to ex-
tend the abstract submission and registration deadlines
for MASAMB 2020.
For recent updates, or if you have questions about the
event, please use #masamb2020 on twitter or email
ssolo@elte.hu!
The 30th Workshop on Mathematical and Statistical
Aspects of Molecular Biology (MASAMB) will be held
in Budapest on April 18 and 19, 2020.
For details see http://masamb2020.elte.hu and below.
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running series of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression, pro-
teomic, metabolomic and single-cell genomics technolo-
gies. These immense data resources, and the underlying
complexities of molecular and cell biology, provide ex-
citing research opportunities for numerate scientists.
With typically around 80-120 participants from mathe-
matics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics, biol-
ogy and related elds, the MASAMB meetings provide
an intimate setting for exchanging ideas in method-
ological and applied research. Research students and
scientists newly entering the eld of genomic research
are particularly welcome and encouraged to submit ab-
stracts. Details of previous meetings are available at the

ICE Helsinki InsectDiseaseEvolution
Jul19-24
We would like to invite submissions to our symposium
addressing the eld of self-medication in social and
solitary insects. The symposium will be held during
the International Congress of Entomology (ICE 2020),
Helsinki, Finland, July 19-24, 2020.
Symposium: Self-medication in insects (organised by
Michael Lattor and Silvio Erler): Insects show remark-
able abilities to choose and balance their diet. They are
avoid the uptake of pathogens from the environment
with their food. When becoming infected insects are
able to shift their diet and use plant derived chemicals
to therapeutically heal themselves. Some insect species
might even be able to use such secondary plant prod-
ucts as prophylactic medication to prevent any infection.
There is the need to identify common mechanisms across
insect orders that promote prophylactic or therapeutic
self-medication.

We are happy to announce that the \*III International
Rupicapra Symposium*" will be held in *Makarska,
Croatia, 21-23 April 2021*.
The Symposium aims to disseminate and exchange sci-
entic knowledge on chamois species and subspecies and
to promote their conservation and sustainable manage-
ment. The two-days scientic programme will cover
topics related to Genetics and Systematics, Physiology
and Disease, Behaviour and Ecology as well as Manage-
ment and Conservation.
We encourage the participation of early career scientists
and we aim at inclusive collaboration with a good gender
balance and wide geographical representation. The Sym-
posium is open to researchers, experts, managers and to
everybody interested in this species, hoping to bridge
the gap between science and practical implementation.

24th Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles Septem-
ber : 22-25 2020
The Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Marseilles is an
annual congress which gather together International sci-
entists interested in the mechanisms of evolution that
generate the incredible diversity of living things found
on Earth (and possibly beyond)
If the congress was initially a local meeting, it quicklygained an important weight in the scientic life. Indeed,
whereas the number of participants has been increas-
ing, the geographical origin of the researchers has been
diversifying and widening year by year.
Today, the Evolutionary Biology Meeting at Mar-
seilles has reached a worldwide dimension and plays a
paramount role in the international scientic life: allow-
ing the gathering of high level specialists, it encourages
the exchange of ideas and stimulates the works of the
researchers all through the world.
The following subjects will be discussed:
* Evolutionary biology concepts and modeling; * Biodi-
versity and Systematics; * Comparative genomics ans
post-genomics (at all taxomic levels); * Functional phy-
logeny; * Environment and biological evolution; * Origin
of life and exobiology; * Non-adaptative versus adapta-
tive evolution; * The minorphyla: their usefulness
in evolutionary biology knowledge; * Convergent evolu-
tion * Evolution of complex traits (Evo-Devo)

Antwerpen CichlidGenomics
Application deadline extended due to the current situa-
tion. New application deadline: 25 March 2020
Fully funded PhD position in cichlid sh Evolutionary
Genomics available in the Svardal lab at the University
of Antwerp
The hundreds of closely related but ecologically diverse
species of Lake Malawi cichlid shes provide an excep-
tional model to study the genomic mechanisms involved
in rapid adaptation and diversication. We have recently
shown that hybridisation in an ancestral population of
Lake Malawi cichlids promoted their adaptive radiation
https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz294 In this project
you will use genomics and transcriptomics to investi-
gate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. You will
apply these techniques in hybrid crosses of divergent
cichlid species in our sh facilities. Furthermore, you
will investigate short and long-read whole-genome se-
quencing data of wild populations. You will use these
data to test for the role of dierent genomic mechanisms
in adaptation and diversication.
Strong prior knowledge in bioinformatics is a plus for this
position, but also candidates with a dierent background
will be considered, if they can demonstrate strong moti-
vation to develop in this direction.
You will need to apply through the University of
Antwerp Job portal providing a cover letter (1 page),
an academic CV and the name of two references. The
cover letter should clearly lay out your motivation to
engage in this project.

FoxPopulationDynamics
A funded PhD position in population dynamics of the
fox in Dorset is available at Bournemouth university.
We are seeking an outstanding PhD candidate to lead on
this exciting project which aims to understand how the
predation pressure experienced locally by bird species of
conservation concern may be determined by the popula-
tion dynamics of a key predator across a large region.
Studies of declining wading bird populations throughout
Europe have typically found that, because of breeding-
season predation, productivity is insucient to replace
natural mortality of older birds (Macdonald & Bolton
2008). Several of the predator species such as the fox
implicated are generalists that thrive in modern human-
dominated landscapes to become disproportionately nu-merous relative to individual prey species.
This is a fully-funded PhD studentship which includes a
stipend of 15,225 each year to support your living costs.

FUBerlin InsectImmunEvolution
Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany Open PhD posi-
tion: Damage, immune defence and pathogen virulence
evolution Application deadline: 30th March 2020
The Evolution and Ecology of Insect Defences group at
the Institute of Biology, Freie Universitaet (FU) Berlin,
Germany, would like to invite applications for a Ger-
man Research Foundation (DFG) funded doctoral candi-
date position (TV-L E13, 65%) for the research project:
\Damage, immune defence and pathogen virulence evo-
lution: From the wild to the lab". The position is
xed-term and available for 4 years and it will start in
June 2020, or as soon as possible thereafter.April 1 2020 EvolDir 11
Project background Our research lies in the eld of eco-
evo-immunology (https://armitagelab.com/). To fully
understand immune defence variation and function it
is essential to consider the ecological context in which
defences are used and the evolutionary pressures placed
on them. Much of our extensive knowledge is from
carefully controlled laboratory-based studies, which is
quite dierent from the complex environments under
which the defences have evolved. Given rapid adap-
tation rates to lab conditions in short-lived insects, it
is relevant to connect insight from the lab with that
from wild organisms. To address this, in this project,
the successful candidate will sample ies (Drosophila
melanogaster) from the wild and examine their \natural
state", in terms of the degree of wounding that they
have been subjected to and their cuticular microbiota.
The latter will be identied and quantied using e.g.
16S rRNA metabarcoding. They will also ask how im-
mune defences of wild- and lab-bred D. melanogaster
dier in terms of resistance to bacterial pathogens, and
whether their associated cuticular microbiota aect the
virulence evolution of bacterial pathogens. A mathemat-
ical/statistical analysis will provide an understanding of
the drivers of the virulence data. The results will give
insight into variation in the natural selection pressures
placed upon the host, and inform us about how they
aect insect defences and pathogen virulence evolution.
The position is part of the \Insect Infect" Research Unit
funded by the DFG. The Research Unit will give the
opportunity for the candidate to interact with a diverse
group of doctoral candidates, post-docs and PIs, to
obtain methodological training, to collaborate with the-
oreticians, and to receive bioinformatics support. There
will be yearly retreats for Research Unit members and
access to a graduate training programme.
Requirements A completed University Master's degree
in biology.
Desirable - We would like applications from enthu-
siastic and highly motivated students with a back-
ground/strong interest in evolutionary ecology. - Lab-
oratory experience with bacteria and insects. - Good
basic knowledge of statistics and experimental design. -
Procient in spoken and written English. - Good team-
working and communication skills. - Ability to work
independently. - A European driving licence would be
an advantage. - Experience in collecting insects from the
wild. - Experience in molecular biology. - Completed
projects/internships on topics relevant to the research
area are advantageous.
How to apply Applications should be written in English
and include the following documents: (1) a cover letter
detailing your suitability and motivation to join theresearch project (no more than one page), (2) a CV in-
cluding details of your research experience, the abstract

eld: WiMi InsectInfect SA. The deadline for applica-
tions is the 30th March 2020. Interviews will take place
as soon as possible after this date. The working lan-
guage of the group is English. For further information,

Iceland for 2020:
\What shapes diversity within a species? Insight from
an Arctic sh
Organisms in the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas are faced
with unprecedented frequent uctuations in their envi-
ronment. In those geographical areas, diversity is mostly
seen within a species (also called intraspecic diversity)
rather than across species. Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpi-
nus), a Northern freshwater sh, has colonised rapidly
freshwater ecosystems after the last glaciation, and pop-
ulations of Arctic charr can be found in various forms
inhabitaing very various habitats (from anadromous
type to small benthic sh living underground). Bulk of
our work at H olar University (North Iceland) has been
to understand the interactions between the environment
and development in shaping phenotypic variation in this
species (e.g. Sk ~Aolason et al. 2019).
We conducted a plasticity experiment manipulating the
diet (benthic versus pelagic) of juveniles sh originating
from 5 populations of Icelandic Arctic charr, as well as
some of their hybrids. Individual growth trajectories
and behaviour of this sh are also known.
We are looking for two motivated students at the MSc
level to characterise brain size/shape and meristic char-
acters dierences (gut length, gut complexity, sex, etc...)
in these sh. Ideally the two students will work hand
in hand collecting data, but each will have a separate
project:
- The interplay of genetic and environmental factors in
shaping brain size and shape in sh12 EvolDir April 1 2020
- The interplay of genetic, developmental and environ-
mental factors in shaping sh phenotypes (focusing on
internal organs and anatomy)
Knowledge on the analysis of shape (geometric morpho-
metrics) and basic coding in R software are good assets,
but not compulsory.
MSc study:
These two research projects are ideal research projects
for a Master in Aquatic biology at H olar University.
This Master is taught in English, with courses available
on site as well as in other Icelandic universities. The
Master is 120ECTS divided into 90ECTS of research
and 30ECTS of courses. We preferably look for MSc
students that will start in the Fall 2020 in our Depart-
ment of Aquaculture and Fish Biology, Sau ~Aoarkr okur
Iceland. These two projects are self-funded but there
are opportunities to secure some small fundings once
the studies have started.
Application: please send a CV and a cover letter indi-
cating why you want to pursue a MSc of research and
why this research topics motivates you? Please indicate

HostParasiteCoevolution
Evolutionary ecology of congeneric monogeneans One of
the research topic of the group of evolutionary ecology of
host-parasite interactions represents the studies of host-
parasite coevolution using the systems of monogenean
parasites and their associated sh hosts. Phylogenetic
and cophylogenetic approaches have been applied to in-
fer the patterns of parasite speciation and diversication
and to reveal historical routes of dispersion of freshwa-
ter sh with current fragmented dispersion. The actual
project of A. Vete ~A^An~A^A'kov ~A^A~A|imkov ~A^A focused
on the investigation of diversity and phylogeny of host-
specic congeneric monogeneans parasitizing cyprinid
sh in Middle East representing the important place of
historical contacts of fauna among three continents. Ac-
tually there is the open position for PhD student within
the above mentioned project. The main objective of
the PhD thesis will be to analyze the diversity and
phylogeny of monogeneans exhibiting dierent level of
host specicity (Dactylogyrus, Gyrodactylus and Diplo-
zooidae). These parasites will be used as supplementary
tool to infer the historical contacts of cypriniform sh
between Middle East and Mediterranean areas using
cophylogenetic approach.
Funding: fellowships of Masaryk University and par-
tial salary covered by a grant project of supervisor.
The successful candidate will follow PhD program at
Masaryk University in Brno. The starting date is
second half of September 2020. Qualication: Ap-
plicants with master degree in biological elds prefer-
ably with the previous experiences in parasite determi-
nations (more specically, working with sh monoge-
neans) and molecular analyses are invited to apply. The
PhD study with the above mentioned topic is open by
Masaryk University (program Evolutionary and Eco-
logical Biology, specialization: Parasitology). Before
submitting an ocial application to Masaryk University
(deadline 30 April, 2020), the candidates are requested
to contact Andrea Vete ~A^An~A^A'kov ~A^A~A|imkov ~A^A

Coexistence of hybrid and polyploid forms of cyprinids:
the role of parasitism
One of the research topic of the group of evolution-
ary ecology of host-parasite interactions represents the
studies of genetic disruption in hybrid and polyploid
sh hosts. Even natural hybridization in cyprinids is
common phenomenon, the frequency of hybrids are rel-
atively low. In contrast, the coexistence of the forms
with dierent ploidy level is extraordinary evolution-
ary phenomenon in sh. Basically,research group of
A. Vete ^A1n kov a ^A ©imkov a focused on genetic disrup-
tion in sh hybrids hypothesizing the potential broken
host-parasite co-adaptation especially for host specic
parasites missing their closely associated hosts. How-
ever, the genes involved in metabolism and reproduction
are in obvious interest as their pattern of expression
may explain the mechanisms of current coexistence of
hybrid and polyploid forms in cyprinids.
Actually there is the open position for PhD student
within the above mentioned research topic. More specif-
ically, the aim of the PhD thesis will beto analyze the
transcriptome prole of diploid-polyploid complex of
cyprinid sh and to search for the over expression and un-
der expression of genes involved in growth, metabolism,
reproduction and immunity. The PhD project will also
include the experimental parasite infection; the quan-
tication of the dierentially expressed genes associ-
ated with parasites will be analyzed in diploid, triploid
and tetraploid forms of hosts. Funding: fellowships of
Masaryk University and partial salary covered by a grant
project of supervisor. The successful candidate will fol-
low PhD program at Masaryk University in Brno. The
starting date is second half of September 2020. Qual-
ication: Applicants with master degree in biological
elds preferably with the previous experiences in molec-
ular analyses including library preparation, qPCRand
NGS bioinformatics analyses (sh transcriptome) are
invited to apply. The PhD study with the above men-
tioned topic is open by Masaryk University (program
Evolutionary and Ecological Biology, specialization: Par-

Sociality and convergent evolution: insights from eco-
morphology and transcriptomics in cockroaches
The Museum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris in-
vites applications for a 3-year PhD position in evolu-
tionary biology. The PhD project will be conducted
under the supervision of Fr ed eric Legendre and Philippe
Grandcolas within the Institut de Syst ematique, Evolu-
tion, Biodiversit e (http://isyeb.mnhn.fr).
Description Despite progresses made in particular
through kinship selection, understanding the circum-
stances of the emergence of integrated social systems
remains a major challenge. In diploid organisms, unlike
haplo-diploid organisms, kinship selection is, however,
not the primary evolutionary cause. Ecological or mor-
phological factors may have played a major role in the
origin of sociality, but their relative importance remains
suggested rather than quantied, without any formal
phylogenetic test. This project aims to study, in a com-
parative framework, the inuence of ecomorphological
factors on the evolution of eusociality in the Blattodea
(cockroaches and termites), a group of diploid insects
with several subsocial convergent lineages and a single
eusocial lineage. These tests will be conducted in the
shift-in-dependent-care hypothesis framework, which
emphasizes the importance of a wood diet and a sub-
social behaviour. In parallel, transcriptomic analyses
will be carried out on four targeted species, in order to
assess the dierential gene expression between wood-
eating (or not) and subsocial (or not) species. Those
transcriptomic data will also be used to assemble the
genomic data acquired elsewhere (out of the scope of
the PhD project) in the framework of the ANR PRCI
SOCIOGENOMICS (PIs: F. Legendre and E. Bornberg-
Bauer; 2020-2024). The PhD student will thus work in
collaboration with our partner, specialized in compara-
tive genomics of insects.
Methods The ecomorphology of the cockroach species
and their social behaviours will be dened on the basis ofliterature and natural history collections. Several mor-
phological features will be characterized: general shape,
shape and ornamentation of the pronotum, leg ornamen-
tation, shape of the mandibles, eye size, presence and
length of wings. Parental behaviours will be identied
from a pre-established list of 11 behaviours. Due to the
broad comparative framework, an initial focus will be
made on four essential lineages (and their sister-groups)
and then progressively extended to other lineages, start-
ing with those present in our 2015 phylogeny, which
will serve as a basis for comparative phylogenetic analy-
ses. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods will be used
(e.g. phylogenetic path analysis, morphospace, ancestral
state modeling).
Skills required - Master degree in evolution, system-
atics, biodiversity or any project- related discipline. -
Established knowledge in phylogenetics and modern
comparative methods (including skills in R). - Ability
to work in an international collaboration. - Knowledge
in comparative anatomy (of insects). - Expertise in
transcriptomic analysis or in the evolution of sociality
would be an asset, as would a naturalist background.
Application submission Applications must be submit-
ted before the 5th of April 2020. The PhD will begin
between May and October 2020. Please send your appli-
cations to both supervisors: detailed resume, motivation
letter, grades (including M2 if possible), contact details
of your current and previous surpervisors. Do not hesi-
tate to contact us before sending your application if you

Job description Applications are invited for a 4 year
position in a Research Fellowship as a PhD Candidate
in Comparative Genomics to be based at the Natural-
History Museum, University of Oslo. The purpose of
the fellowship is research training leading to the suc-
cessful completion of a PhD degree. The fellowship
requires admission to the PhD program at the Faculty
of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Appointment to
a research fellowship is conditional upon admission to
the Faculty's research training program. A plan for the
research training must be submitted no later than two
months after taking up the position, and the admission
approved within three months. Compulsory service,
duty work, shall represent 25% of the total hours of
work.
More about the position The subject of the PhD project
will part of the recently founded RCN-project \Inver-
tOmics - Phylogeny and evolution of lophotrochozoan
invertebrates based on genomic data". The origin and
evolution of Bilateria is controversially discussed in sev-
eral biological disciplines such as systematics or evo-
lutionary developmental biology. In one hypothesis,
evolution in Bilateria advances from a simple body or-
ganization similar to atworms towards more complex
forms several times independently. In the other one, the
evolution progresses in the opposite direction from a
complex ancestor more like an annelid to simple organi-
zations by several separate reductions. Support for one
or the other depends on the phylogeny and evolution of
Lophotrochozoa, one of the major bilaterian taxa, but
a robust phylogeny is still lacking despite recent phy-
logenomic studies. This is due to both low coverage by
genomic data and misleading biases in data of lophotro-
chozoan taxa. In this project, high-quality reference
genomes shall be generated and new procedures to both
ameliorate negative eects of biases and establish a new
support measurement, which is entirely dierent from
all recent support measurements. Due to both the large
genomic dataset and these thorough analyses, a robust
phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa shall be provided allowing
contributions to discussions about the origin and evolu-
tion of Bilateria as well as of lophotrochozoan taxa and
character traits. The aim of this PhD project as part
of InvertOmics is to concentrate on the problem of re-
constructing the phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa from the
data side. Therefore, new high-quality genomes for 50
lophotrochozoan species covering all 16 lophotrochozoan
phyla shall be generated. Modern genome sequencing
strategies combining long and short reads will be em-
ployed. As several lophotrochozoan species have very
small body sizes ( <500 length) this is challenging,
but existing protocols for single-cell genomics shall beoptimized for single small-sized individuals collected
from natural populations as part of the project. These
data together with publicly available genomes will be
used to reconstruct the phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa
and address possible biases in the dataset using newly
developed approaches as part of this project (see the ac-
companying advertisement for a PostDoc position). The
phylogenetic reconstructions will be used to trace the
evolution of dierent character traits within Lophotro-
chozoa and Bilateria, which also take into account the
uncertainty of relationships. Therefore, modern macro-
evolutionary tools to reconstruct ancestral states will
be used. The Natural History Museum has a modern
DNA laboratory as well as access to the Norwegian Su-
percomputer facilities. The PhD will be associated with
the research group \Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology",
specically Torsten Struck (Professor of Evolutionary
Genomics).

Master's degree or equivalent in biology or related disci-
plines like bioinformatics. - A good command of English
is required. - We seek a person with strong motiva-
tion for research in genomics. - The candidate must

PhD position in conservation genetics: The importance
of inbreeding and genetic drift in conservation of frag-
mented populations16 EvolDir April 1 2020
A fully-funded 4-year PhD position in basic conserva-
tion genetics research is available at the Centre for
Biodiversity Dynamics, Department of Biology, Nor-
wegian University of Science and Technology (http://-
www.ntnu.edu/cbd).
About the position: A major challenge in conservation
biology is the lack of information needed to properly
evaluate genetic risks of population extinction. Speci-
cally, there is great need for a better understanding of
the mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression and
loss of genetic variation in nature, and how these pro-
cesses aect the dynamics and viability of fragmented
populations. The PhD project is part of a research
project recently funded by the Research Council of Nor-
way (RCN) that aims to provide such insight. First,
the PhD candidate will integrate genomic analyses of
inbreeding and genetic drift with high-quality demo-
graphic data to identify the causes of spatio-temporal
variation in inbreeding and inbreeding depression, and
examine the occurrence and strength of drift load in sub-
divided house sparrow (Passer domesticus) populations
at the coast of Norway. Second, data from both nat-
ural and experimentally-manipulated populations will
be used to examine the genetic architecture of inbreed-
ing depression and heterosis. Third, novel quantitative
genetics and genomics approaches will be used to quan-
tify the eect of inbreeding and drift for the adaptive
potential in subdivided populations. These results will
be combined with results from other parts of the RCN
project to evaluate the importance of genetic processes
and spatial structure for the short- and long-term via-
bility of fragmented populations.
The PhD student will work closely with two postdocs
and national and international collaborators and will
be supervised by Professor Henrik Jensen (main su-
pervisor), Professor Jane Reid and Associate Professor
Stefanie Mu (co-supervisors) at CBD, NTNU.
Job description: The PhD project will involve sophis-
ticated statistical analyses of extensive genomic data
(genome-wide high-density SNP genotypes and whole
genome sequences) and eld data (individual data on
phenotypes, survival and reproduction). The PhD stu-
dent is expected to participate in eldwork and further
research training in house sparrow populations at the
coast of mid- and northern Norway. The project would
suit a highly motivated and numerate student with
enthusiasm for working on fundamental questions in
conservation genetics using empirical data. Full training
in key aspects of the project, and associated transferable
skills, will be provided. The position provides an excel-
lent opportunity for students who wish to qualify for
future work in both basic and applied research positions
and/or wish to pursue a career in academia.Qualication requirements: We seek candidates with
a keen interest in conservation genetic questions and
a strong academic record in quantitative evolutionary
ecology and/or population genetics (including quanti-
tative genetics and genomics). Good competence in R
and/or other statistical programming languages is also
important. The qualication requirement is completion
of a master's degree or second degree (equivalent to
120 credits) in biology or equivalent education, with
a grade of B or better in terms of NTNU's grading
scale. Applicants with no letter grades from previous
studies must have an equally good academic foundation.
Applicants who are unable to meet these criteria may
be considered only if they can document that they are
particularly suitable candidates for education leading
to a PhD degree. MSc students who expect to com-
plete their master's degree studies by summer 2020 are
also encouraged to apply. Employment will then be
postponed until the master's degree is nished.
Other desired qualications: - Fundamental knowledge
or very strong interest in relevant topics in conservation
genetics and evolutionary biology, for example inbreed-
ing depression, heterosis, genetic rescue, quantitative
genetics - Willingness to learn and use novel statistical
and/or mathematical analysis methods - Good writ-
ten and oral English - Some experience with eldwork
and/or molecular genetic laboratory work is favourable -
Experience working with large genomics data sets would
be advantageous
Personal characteristics: - Highly motivated and en-
thusiastic about conservation genetics - Excellent team-
working and written and verbal communication skills -
An independent, self-driven working style
We oer: - An exciting and stimulating project that is
part of a strong international academic research environ-
ment - An open and inclusive work environment with
dedicated and interactive supervisors and colleagues,
fostering gender equality and international mobility in
science

Stockholm ButteryPlantEvolution
PhD position in Evolutionary genomics of buttery-
plant associations (deadline April 23)
A PhD position has been announced at the Department
of Zoology, Stockholm University, Sweden, as part of
the project \Evolving modularity in the adaptations
of phytophagous insects to their host plants", newly
funded by the Swedish Research Council.
The Department of Zoology is a vibrant international
community, consisting of ve interactive and collabora-
tive divisions: Ecology, Ethology, Functional Morphol-
ogy, Population Genetics, and Systematics and Evolu-
tion. The advertised PhD will be part of the Division
of Ecology.
The project aims to improve our understanding of the
causal mechanisms behind the evolutionary patterns
observed in insect-plant associations, and is based on
the idea that adaptations to specic host plants can
best be understood as \modules" of co-expressed genes
and the corresponding phenotypes { in particular larval
performance on dierent hosts.
Work in the PhD project will focus on butteries, and
will involve eld collection and laboratory rearing of in-
sects, including short-term selection experiments, as well
as genomic analysis of in particular RNA-sequencing
data. Experience from rearing and genomics of non-
model insects is thus particularly meriting.
The position is for four years full time, with salary and
social security. To be eligible you need a degree cor-
responding to at least four years of higher education,
including an independent project at an advanced level in
animal ecology, evolutionary biology or similar subject
(i.e. a Master's degree or similar).
The project will be supervised by Prof. S oren Nylin:
https://www.su.se/english/proles/snylin-1.183643
and co-supervised by Prof. Niklas Janz:

YeastExperimentalEvolution
Fully funded 4-year PhD position available in Population
Genetics: Dynamics of Adaptation using Experimental
Evolution with Yeast, Fitness Landscape Theory, and
Machine Learning
Supervisor: Rike Stelkens Start date: October 2020
(negotiable) Application deadline: 23 April 2020
A PhD position in experimental evolution with the bud-
ding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is available in the
Stelkens lab. We are generally interested in the role
of hybridization - the interbreeding of individuals from
genetically divergent populations or species - in adap-
tive evolution. Hybridization instantly increases the
genetic variation of the populations, which can be ex-
ploited for adaptation through natural selection, and
help hybrids succeed in ecological niches where parents
cannot survive. At the same time, hybridization is a
serious conservation concern because hybrid ospring
usually have poor tness. We are excited by this 'dou-
ble agent' role of hybridization with both detrimental
and benecial eects on biodiversity, especially under
environmental stress.
Topics of this PhD thesis include (but are not limited) to
1) the dynamics of adaptation to changing environments
with and without hybridization, 2) the construction of
empirical tness landscapes using DNA barcodes to
track the evolution of lineages over time, 3) understand-
ing the genetic architecture of (hybrid) tness using
machine learning and statistical modelling. This posi-
tion is part of a paired PhD programme between the
Zoology and Mathematics Department at Stockholm
University. The goal of this programme is to scruti-
nize mathematical theory with experimental data, and
to combine population genetics, machine learning and
statistical modelling.
Qualications: We are looking for a highly motivated
person with a strong interest in evolutionary biology,18 EvolDir April 1 2020
ideally with experience in experimental evolution and
quantitative/molecular/population genetics. Prior train-
ing in Saccharomyces yeast cultivation, statistics and
programming (e.g. R, Python, Perl) is a plus. Appli-
cants should be able to think quantitatively, be well-
organized, good communicators, and happy to work in
our very international team. The applicant is expected
to be uent in English. Training will be provided in
experimental evolution, forward and reverse molecular
genetics, statistics, bioinformatics, genomic data anal-
ysis, and microbiology. There is exibility within the
project for the student to develop their own interests.
The graduate program covers four years of full-time
study. The position can be combined with teaching
(maximum 20%), which prolongs the employment with
the corresponding time. The successful candidate will
receive salary and full social benets according to local
agreements.
Environment: The campus is located four metro stops
from the center of Stockholm, one of the most beautiful
and dynamic capitals in Europe. The campus is home
to a vibrant scientic community, including the Science
for Life Laboratory (genomics and bioinformatics core
facility) and the Swedish Museum of Natural History.
Sweden is a free and open society, and strives to be one
of the world?s most innovative and research-intensive
nations. We enjoy a respected system of democracy and
individual rights, free health care, freedom of speech, a
free press, the right to scrutinize those in power, and
access to beautiful nature. Most Swedes speak English.
Application: Please send formal application, including

PhD opportunity in Evolutionary Biology at the Uni-
versidade de Lisboa, Portugal
We are seeking one PhD candidate to apply to the 2020
Doctoral Program of the Portuguese Science and Tech-
nology Foundation (Funda c ao para a Ci^ encia e Tecnolo-
gia) to conduct research on the mechanisms underlying
divergence and speciation of a seabird complex that has
seasonal breeding populations isolated by time.
Project: A possible mechanism of sympatric speciation
is allochrony, in which dierences in breeding times
lead to temporal assortative mating and limit gene ow
among asynchronous breeders. With this project we
propose to characterize the genomic architecture of re-
gions of evolutionary signicance in temporal divergence
and speciation. The project will focus on the Madeiran
Storm-petrel complex, which showcases one of the only
known avian example with divergence and cryptic specia-
tion driven by isolation by time (Friesen et al. 2007, Silva
et al., 2016, Taylor et al. 2017, 2019). The sympatric
but allochronic populations of this species complex span
the speciation continuum from complete reproductive
isolation in the Azores, where seasonal (ie, summer and
winter) populations have speciated, to those weakly dif-
ferentiated in Madeira, and genetically admixed in Cape
Verde and the South Atlantic. The pattern of replicated

Graduate Position in Conservation and Evolutionary
Genomics
University of Louisiana at Lafayette
The Cassin Sackett Lab at the University of Louisiana
is looking for a highly motivated graduate student to
study population and conservation genomics in prairie
dogs or associated species (e.g., other rodents and eas).
We use ancient DNA, eld sampling, next-generation
sequencing and bioinformatic approaches to answer fun-
damental questions in evolutionary biology, especially
those with practical conservation applications. Some
major questions being asked in the lab are:
§How do humans inuence the evolution of wildlife? We
study the ways in which climate change, habitat alter-
ation, and introduced diseases impact the distribution of
genetic variation, rates of gene ow, and the probability
of adaptation.
§What is the genomic basis of rapid adaptation to novel
pathogens? We examine the demographic and environ-
mental constraints to adaptation and whether genomic
architecture of rapid adaptation diers from that of
more gradual adaptation (e.g., to climate).
Please visit the lab website for more details on cur-
rent projects: www.cassinsackett.com The student will
work in a collaborative environment on aspects of a
project that uses genomic approaches to investigatethe potential for resistance to *Yersinia pestis*, the
bacteria causing plague. Projects could include: 1) sys-
tematics, co-evolution and vector competence in eas,
2) landscape genetics, phylogeography and adaptation
in prairie dogs, 3) molecular evolution in prairie dogs,
4) evolution in co-occurring rodent species, or 5) other
relevant topics.
The position is supported by a teaching assistantship,
with the possibility of future RA support pending fund-
ing. The position will be based in UL's Department
of Biology (https://biology.louisiana.edu/). Interested
applicants should contact cassin.sackett@gmail.com for
inquiries. The desired start date is spring 2021.

TWO PHD POSITIONS IN PLANT EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NAPLES
1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The selected student
will work with Dr. Salvatore Cozzolino (https://-
www.docenti.unina.it/salvatore.cozzolino) on a research
project entitled \The contribution of plastic and hered-
itable components in scent emission for shaping species
distribution and speciation in sexually deceptive or-April 1 2020 EvolDir 23
chids"
We are interested in how diversity evolves and under-
standing the processes and factors that determine the
spatial distribution of species on the planet. By us-
ing one of the most evolutionary successful families of
owering plants, the orchids, as a study system, we
are addressing a set of inter-related questions about
species sorting/species coexistence and competition. In
particular, by focusing on sexually orchids, oral scent
traits modulating adaptations to pollinators as well as
their molecular bases will be studied using selection
analysis, phenotyping (particularly for oral volatiles)
and segregation analyses. We are particularly interested
in how plasticity and hereditability of scent emission
in sexually deceptive Ophrys allows the potential for
rapid adaptation to local pollinator. This is a central
issue for species radiation but also for rapid adaptive re-
sponse to climate changes. POSITION CHARACTER-
ISTICS: The Department of Biology in Naples (http://-
www.dipartimentodibiologia.unina.it/) oers excellent
research facilities and a stimulating working environment
for graduate students in plant ecology and evolution.
The project will also involve strict collaboration with
orchid researchers in Germany (Prof. Philipp Schlueter)
and Switzerland (Prof. Florian Schiestl). Salary is
according to the University of Naples PhD guidelines.
Funding, including for laboratory and eld costs, is
available for 3 years.
REQUIREMENTS: Applicants should hold a Master
degree in plant systematics, biodiversity, plant ecology
or evolutionary biology. Prior experience with plants
and/or pollinators is an advantage, expertise in pro-
ling scent emission by GC-MS and solid preparation
in biostatistics are highly appreciated. Prociency in
English both orally and written is a must; for a project

will work with Dr. Salvatore Cozzolino (https://-
www.docenti.unina.it/salvatore.cozzolino) on a research
project entitled \ The potential for rapid pollinator
niche diversication is fueled by ancestral lineage hy-
bridization"
We are interested in how diversity evolves and under-
standing the processes and factors that determine the
rapid sorting of species in some radiating clades. By
using one of the faster owering plant radiating group,
as the Mediterranean sexually deceptive Ophrys, we
are addressing a set of inter-related questions about
species sorting/radiation by ancestral hybridization. In
particular, we focus on two recent species groups that
presumable sorted out and quickly radiated following
hybridization of ancestral lineages. The PhD project
will focus on testing the tempo and mode of origin by
hybridization of the these radiating Ophrys lineages by
using genomic tools and in-depth phylo-/population-
/pan-genomics analytical approaches.

\Surveillance of invasive xylophagous beetles using DNA
metabarcoding" Biological invasions represent the third
most important global threat to biodiversity and a ma-
jor risk for the economy, the environment and society.24 EvolDir April 1 2020
A major nding in the last few years is the sharp in-
crease in interceptions of emerging exotic species, not
previously known as invasive and sometimes unknown
to science. It is therefore essential to develop genomic
tools that will allow to detect and identify exotic species
potentially invasive to be able to set up measures to
eradicate them at an early stage.
The main aim of this thesis is to develop a non-
destructive metabarcoding approach to detect newly
arrived exotic xylophagous cerambycid beetles collected
with automatic pheromone traps set up across the ma-
jor European ports of entry. We will develop DNA
barcoding reference libraries for Holarctic Cerambyci-
dae beetles with a focus on China as a major source of
invasive species into Europe.
This thesis is part of the European project HOMED
(http://homed-project.eu/) The position is available
from 1st October 2020 and limited to 3 years. We are
seeking a student who is highly motivated and passionate
about Genomics and Entomology. Preferred candidates

autosome fusions are common in Lepidoptera, which
makes them ideal model system for investigations into es-

The project aims at investigating drivers of lepidopteran
neo-sex chromosome evolution and a role of sex chromo-

Job Oslo: Associate Professor in environmental DNA
https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/-
184311/associate-professor-in-environmental-dna The
Natural History Museum is recruiting an Associate
Professor in environmental DNA. The appointment is a
fulltime, permanent position with a starting date no
later than 1 January 2021.
The Natural History Museum (NHM) at the Univer-
sity of Oslo holds Norway's most extensive collections
of animals, plants, and fungi. These natural history
collections are invaluable repositories because they en-
able the scientic community to answer key questions
about geographical and temporal variation in biodiver-
sity. As a museum, we seek to be at the forefront of
developments in biology and adapt our infrastructure to
the needs of science and society today. To develop our
position at the cutting edge of modern biodiversity re-
search, we are recruiting an associate professor in eDNA.
This person enters a vibrant research environment in
which ve out of eight research groups at the museum
apply and develop metabarcoding and metagenomics
approaches for various research questions. These in-
clude molecular biodiversity assessments, applied work
on the authentication of food and medicine, as well asecological or evolutionary questions using aquatic envi-
ronmental DNA, trophic material, bulk invertebrate and
plant samples, soil DNA, and sedimentary ancient DNA.
Traditionally, the museum ^As strategy emphasizes the
use and collection of individual specimens for morpholog-
ical or molecular research. The collection infrastructure
requirements of environmental samples calls for a re-
assessment of our workows, including physical sample
storage, DNA bank storage, in-silico repositories, and
reproducibility of analysis pipelines.
The appointed associate professor will lead the devel-
opment of the museum ^As capacity in the eld of envi-
ronmental DNA. This capacity includes the initiation
of new research programs, teaching and supervising stu-
dents, and curating and developing scientic collections
of eDNA samples based on the applicant's taxonomic
expertise.
We seek an active researcher with a relevant and strong
publication record, and with a clear vision for devel-
oping an independent museum-based research program
in eDNA. The successful candidate should be on an
upward trajectory and is expected to have strong poten-
tial to execute competitive research projects at a high
international level. He or she should have the ability
to create an attractive research environment and per-
form research that inspires synergistic interactions with
current research at the museum. The ideal candidate
would focus on using environmental DNA to study fun-
damental questions in biology, rather than applying or
developing methods for monitoring purposes.
An attractive start-up package is available. However,
the successful applicant will be expected to obtain extra-
mural research funding, and a proven record of acquiring
such funding is essential.
NHM has a collaborative agreement with the Depart-
ment of Biological Sciences about teaching and supervi-
sion of students at the bachelor and master's level, and
with the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences
for supervision of doctoral candidates. NHM also hosts
an international research school in biosystematics (For-
Bio). The successful candidate is expected to participate
in teaching at all levels and be a capable and enthusias-
tic supervisor of master's and PhD students. Relevant
background in working with museum collections will be
an advantage in building up a physical infrastructure for
eDNA samples. Up to 50% of the working time will be
devoted to curating collections (main activity), teaching
and supervision of students, outreach and administra-
tive tasks at NHM. Lectures and tuition are given in
Norwegian and English. Foreign language speakers are
expected to be able to teach in a Scandinavian language
within two years after being hired.April 1 2020 EvolDir 37
Qualication requirements
The successful applicant must have
- A PhD or an equivalent doctoral degree in biology - A
postdoctoral research prole with relevant experience
in environmental DNA, e.g., biodiversity assessments
using molecular approaches - Experience with relevant
sample types, e.g., bulk samples, aquatic eDNA, fae-
cal DNA, soil DNA, sedimentary ancient DNA and the
analytical challenges associated with these samples - Ex-
perience with bioinformatic analyses of high-throughput
sequence data, statistical analyses and visualization of
results of metabarcoding/metagenomics data - Actively
publishing scientic papers of high quality - Excellent
English language skills (written and spoken)
The successful applicant should have
- Coherent taxonomic expertise relevant to their eDNA
research - Proven ability to attract external research

University SUNY)
Overview:The Prior Lab at Binghamton University
SUNY is seeking one undergraduate student for a Re-
search Experience for Undergraduate (REU) intern-
ship this summer. The successful applicant will de-
velop an independent project that contributes to NSF-
funded research investigating how insect host para-
sitoid communities are altered under global change in
the Pacic Northwest. Please see the Prior Lab web-
site for the type of research projects that we work on
(www.priorecologylab.com).
We seek a highly motivated and enthusiastic undergradu-
ate student for a 10-week full-time, paid internship. The
majority of the time ( ~8 weeks) will be spent conducting
eld research in the Pacic Northwest (northern Ore-
gon, Washington State, and Vancouver Island, British
Columbia), with the remaining ( ~2 weeks) in the lab
at Binghamton University, NY analyzing results and
writing a report. Dates are somewhat exible, between
mid-May and mid-August 2020.
The selected students will conduct independent research,
mentored by Dr. Kirsten Prior, in conjunction with an
NSF-funded research project: Uncovering the role of
altered cryptic interactions in driving the demographic
success of a range-expanding species.? This project fo-
cuses on how insect communities (oak gall wasps and par-
asitoids) are altered under range expansions. One gall
wasp species recently expanded its range from mainland
western North America to Vancouver Island, British
Columbia, where it's outbreaking and has become a tree
pest. We're investigating how interactions with other
gall wasps (competitors), parasitoids (enemies), and the
host plant (oak) are altered when this species' expands
its range, and how these altered interactions facilitate
outbreaks. We combine eld surveys and experiments
in the species' native and expanded ranges, along with
molecular tools to understand how interactions are al-
tered and contribute to outbreaks. There are several
independent research project ideas that the selected stu-
dent could develop within this study system, and will
work with Dr. Prior to develop a project.
Benets:The selected student will receive a $5000stipend and housing during the 10-week program. Ad-
ditionally, up to $700 will be provided to travel to the
Pacic Northwest. There are also modest funds for sup-
plies. The student will live in a shared residence with
Ph.D. students and eld technicians. The student will
pay for their own food with the use of a eld vehicle that
can be used to get groceries and a kitchen to prepare
food.
Eligibility:Applicants must be rising sophomore, junior,
or senior undergraduate students currently enrolled in a
degree program. Due to NSF funding restrictions, only
U.S. citizens, nationals, or permanent residents are eli-
gible. Students must have a valid passport and driver's
license. Applicants should be willing and able to work
under sometimes strenuous eld conditions, work and
live will with others, and be able to adapt to exible
and irregular hours that are needed when conducting
eld research.
To Apply:Applications should be submitted to Dr.
Kirsten Prior by email ( kprior@binghamton.edu). Ap-
plications are being considered now, and will be consid-
ered up to?March 27, 2020. Applications should include

Looking For 16s
MicrobiomeSequence DataSets
Dear List:
I am teaching a research course this semester that was
to generate 16S sequence data to characterize the gut,
oral, and skin microbiomes of wild frogs and turtles. It
now seems likely that this lab class will not meet again
in person this semester, leaving us without sequence
data to analyze. I am therefore looking for any 16S
sequence data sets out there that I could use to con-
tinue this course online. This would preferably be from
herps but not necessarily. One aim of this course is to
expose students to authentic research so unpublished

Spain VolFieldAssist PlantEvolEcol
JunJul
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and
Technology (IST) Austria is recruiting volunteers to as-
sist with eldwork on plant adaptation in the Pyrenees
(Spain) this coming summer (June-July).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary processes
underlying population divergence in wild Antirrhinum
majus (snapdragons). We focus on natural hybrid zones
between two subspecies with dierent ower colours.
Most of the eld work is contributing to a long-term
pedigree project aimed at establishing a direct link from
genotype to phenotype to tness. With tens of thou-
sands of samples collected over ten years so far, this
provides an exciting and powerful system to examinemany outstanding questions about adaptation and quan-
titative genetics in wild populations.
The work: We are seeking volunteers to assist with the
eld research, which involves mapping the location of
individual plants (GPS), tagging and sampling them for
leaves and owers, measuring quantitative traits, and
processing samples back at the eld station. There may
also be opportunities to be involved in other projects
on plant-insect interactions. The work is highly team-
orientated, typically in groups of 2-3. This is a great
opportunity for anybody looking to obtain experience
in eldwork relating to evolutionary biology and plant
ecology.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia).
We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a pic-
turesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(WITHIN EUROPE) are covered. However, we cannot
oer any further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students/graduates with a strong
interest in working outdoors with plants. You must be
meticulous with recording data and also be comfortable
working as part of a team. Experience with eld-based
projects and plants is preferred but not essential.
We require a minimum stay of 3 weeks between May
28 and July 30. To apply, send your CV or resume by
March 15. Include a few sentences about your back-
ground and why you are interested, and include the ap-
proximate date range you are available. Send any ques-
tions and your application to carina.baskett@ist.ac.at.

Tunisia VolFieldAssist
AntBehaviour
Volunteer eld assistant for navigational research with
desert ants in Tunisia
Navigation plays a major role in animal behaviour. The
desert ant Cataglyphis fortis, inhabiting the open salt
pans, has an extraordinary navigational system which
guides it during its long-lasting foraging trips. The
ant uses a so called path integration vector that, based
on a sun compass and a step counter calculates the
ant'^As relative position to the nest. In addition, homing
ants learn and use visual and olfactory cues to nallyApril 1 2020 EvolDir 45
pinpoint their nest entrance.
Our group explores the role of olfaction in the behaviour
of Cataglyphis fortis ants. While we could already show,
that the ants use food and nest odours for pinpointing
their targets, and learn olfactory landmarks to navigate
between nest and food, we will now explore, whether
and how olfaction regulates the high aggression between
neighbouring ant colonies. The project includes eld-
work in a Tunisian saltpan where we investigate the
behaviour of ants in their natural environment (from
mid-June to mid-August 2020). We will stay at a sh-
erman' ^As town called Mahar ^A^As and drive daily to a
desiccated salt lake where we perform our experiments
(approx. 60 km from Mahar ^A^As). Based on the level
of interest, the eld assistance may also be expanded to
a master' ^As or bachelor' ^As thesis.
These requirements should be fullled: Heat and sun
resistant, t enough for exhaustive days in the salt
pan, interested in insects and animal behaviour. A
driving license would be good but is not a necessary
condition. We oer in exchange a rare possibility to
gain eldwork experience and an intense insight in the
eld of behavioural biology of the fascinating desert ant
Cataglyphis fortis. We cover travel costs and accom-
modation (for a minimum of four weeks stay however,
longer is desirable).

The NSF-funded Visible Ape Website has nally been
launched, at www.visibleapeproject.com Details about
it are given below: One of the major questions in bi-
ology is how small genotypic dierences can underpin
striking phenotypic dierences in anatomy, physiology,
development, and behavior, like those seen between hu-
mans and apes. Indeed, we share nearly 99% of our
DNA with chimpanzees, our closest living ape relatives,
despite having substantially dierent appearances and
behaviors. In order to study these genotype-phenotype
relationships across humans and apes, detailed phe-
notypic data, including anatomical data, are needed.
The Visible Ape Project (VAP) includes a comprehen-46 EvolDir April 1 2020
sive, user-friendly and freely available website on ape
anatomy and evolution, the Visible Ape Website.The
website will serve as a valuable cross-disciplinary re-
source and create interdisciplinary connections between
medical/veterinary education and biological anthropol-
ogy, and support public interest in science, drawing fur-
ther attention to and awareness of apes, whose continued
existence in the wild is seriously threatened. A number
of outreach activities, including US and internationally-
collaborative workshops, educational, and conservation
activities, will reach the public, students from the high
school level through graduate levels, and researchers and
medical/veterinary practitioners, around the globe,as
well, crucially, rural communities living near apes.

Bilbao Spain DiseaseGenomics
Postdoc position available at the Integrative Genomics
lab
The recently created Integrative Genomics lab led by
Urko M. Marigorta at the CIC bioGUNE in Bilbao
(Basque Country, Spain) seeks a motivated candidate
to join as a postdoctoral researcher to work in the area
of complex disease genomics.
About your position and the project You will apply
statistical and bioinformatics expertise to spearhead
a project exploring the genetic architecture of com-
plex disease, with a focus on the molecular mecha-
nisms that drive heterogeneity in symptoms as well
as on developing new predictors for longitudinal track-
ing of disease. This work involves dealing with large
omic datasets generated in-house (e.g. we are gener-
ating genomic and longitudinal transcriptomic proles
of patients to investigate the underpinnings of drug
response in Crohn ^As disease), and/or gathered fromlarge-scale public biobank databases. The specics of
the project should remain within the focus areas of the
lab (https://www.cicbiogune.es/people/umartinez), but
can be adapted according to your research goals and ex-
pertise (including experience in other disease domains).
Financial support for this position is available for up to
three years (32.3k euro /year gross salary). Start date
is negotiable, but the position is immediately available.
The requirements This postdoctoral position suits best
a researcher with a background in complex trait genet-
ics, including experience with statistical genetics and
genetic epidemiology, being acquainted with the analy-
sis of large omic datasets. Candidates coming from a
quantitative eld (with a PhD in areas such as statis-
tics or computer science) and that have a demonstrated
interest in disease genomics are also welcomed to apply.
Strong bioinformatic skills, with uency in R, Python or
similar languages, and an ability to work independently
and an inquisitive mind are a must. Experience in im-
munology, and/or other areas in computational biology,
are desirable but not essential.
The lab Our lab addresses emerging questions in dis-
ease biology and tackles them using a combination of
statistical genomics and medical transcriptomics. This
integrative approach, based on analyses of multilayer
-omic proles from clinical cohorts, improves our un-
derstanding of complex disease etiology and permits to
rene the estimation of disease risk. Our long-term goal
is to gear this knowledge towards development of new
precision medicine-based solutions that can improve dis-
ease and patient management. More details about our
research are available at https://www.cicbiogune.es/-
people/umartinez . How to Motivated candidates should
apply with a package that includes (i) a detailed CV, (ii)

*Start (negotiable): autumn 2020 *Duration: 2 years
(with possibility for an extension) *Place: Department
of Botany, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic,
EU
We seek a highly motivated, independent early career re-
searcher interested in leading a research program within
the context of an ERC-funded project focused on the
evolutionary consequences of whole genome duplication
(for details see below). The successful candidate will join
the team of Ecological Genomics lead by Filip Kol a (
https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen). This project will
involve close collaboration with other labs focused on
ecological and evolutionary genomics of polyploidy, Levi
Yant (University of Nottingham, UK) and Christian
Parisod (University of Bern, Switzerland).
**Requirements - innovative thinking, enthusiasm for
evolutionary biology - keen interest in leading an inde-
pendent research program and collaborating both within
the group and internationally - a strong background
in structural, statistical, and/or population genomics -
PhD in evolutionary biology, genetics, bioinformatics,
or related elds
**We oer - competitive monthly salary of 2,400 EUR
(note that average gross salary in the Czech Republic
was~1,350 EUR monthly in 2019 and living expenses
are generally lower in CZ) - work in a young, dynamic
and international environment, situated in an inspiring
city centre - co-supervision of a PhD student in the
same project - involvement in international collabora-
tion including stays in collaborating labs
**Optional - further possibilities for strengthening aca-
demic career - take part in teaching relevant courses -
supervision of master project(s) in the Bioinformatics or
Evolutionary Biology program - participate in eldwork
in Europe or North America - opportunity to develop
independent research follow-up project - support for
seeking additional self-funded projects in national (e.g.
Junior Researcher projects within The Czech Science
Foundation) and international funding schemes (e.g.
Marie Curie, EMBO fellowship)
***Project details Whole genome duplication (WGD,
polyploidization) is a dramatic genome-wide mutationwhose ubiquity across eukaryotes suggests an adaptive
benet, although the underlying mechanism remains un-
known. In the project, the successful applicant will test
the hypothesis that WGD promotes formation and/or
later accumulation of structural changes in a genome
(gene duplications, inversions, repetitive DNA prolifer-
ation), potentially providing adaptive benets when
facing novel environmental challenges. The project
will build on our research in Arabidopsis arenosa that
demonstrated that WGD can increase the capacity of
its natural populations to accumulate adaptive varia-
tion, but the candidate will extend well-beyond this
system to additional species to discern the generality of
initial ndings from the A. arenosa system. The core
work will focus on analysis of population genomic data
from eld surveys of ploidy-variable systems (diploid-
autotetraploid), providing replicates of the WGD pro-
cess in natural conditions. There will be possibility to
expand to analyses of variation in experimental popula-
tions involving newly synthesized polyploids. General
conclusions will be drawn taking advantage from repli-
cated ploidy-variable plant species, which are partly
already sampled and sequenced. Alongside the head -
start with available data, the candidate is expected to
be fully involved in the overall project design and lead
the analytical part of the project. For overall info on the

GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel is
a foundation of public law jointly nanced by the Federal
Republic of Germany (90%) and the state of Schleswig-
Holstein (10%) and is one of the internationally leading
institutions in the eld of marine sciences. Currently
GEOMAR disposes over an annual budget of approx.
80 million Euro and has approx. 1000 employees.
The research unit Evolutionary Ecology of Marine Fishes
of the research division \Marine Ecology" is oering a
position as
Postdoc (m/f/d) in Comparative Genomics
starting on May 1st, 2020 or upon agreement.
In the Research Group \Parental investment and im-
mune dynamics", we study the evolution of pregnancy
focusing on syngnathids (pipeshes and seahorses) with
their unique male pregnancy. This reproduction strat-
egy evolved from carrying eggs loosely attached to the
body to full pregnancy encompassing several intermedi-
ate forms. Thus, syngnathids present an ideal system
to identify changes associated to the evolutionary steps
from egg laying towards advanced pregnancy. Experi-
mentally, we investigate changes in the immune system
that allowed male pregnancy to evolve and assess the
molecular basis associated to the evolution of syng-
nathids' increasingly complex brooding structures and
pregnancy. To do so, we combine a diversity of molecu-
lar and developmental biological methods, genetic en-
gineering (CRISPR/ cas9) with comparative genomics
and transcriptomics. We have recently sequenced 13
genomes of pipeshes and seahorses.Job Description
Using comparative genomics, we aim to elucidate the
coevolution of the immune system with male pregnancy.
We recently determined that parts of the adaptive im-
mune system have been lost during the evolution of
male pregnancy. Comparative analyses of specic im-
mune gene families and developmental pathways will
permit to gain insight into how the immune system
has been remodeled and how this relates to male preg-
nancy evolution. We furthermore aim to identify gene
co-option accompanying the evolution of pregnancy and
the establishment of new genes with subsequent neo-
or sub-functionalization. To do so, transcriptomic anal-
yses of genes that are dierentially expressed during
male pregnancy should be combined with genome-wide
selection analyses. The project will be conducted in
close collaboration with the experimental PhD students
and postdocs in the laboratory that are focusing on
genetic engineering of pregnancy genes, gene expression
visualization and tissue transplant experiments.
Qualication The successful candidate is required to
have a PhD in Natural Sciences (Biology, Bioinformat-
ics or a related discipline). We expect a highly motivated
Postdoc with a keen interest and background in compar-
ative genomics, transcriptomics and evolutionary biol-
ogy, that will allow the candidate to eciently analyze
the available data-sets and prepare manuscripts to be
submitted to respected peer-reviewed international sci-
entic journals. Knowledge of programming languages
(Perl/Python/R) is thus required. Experience with gene
annotation, orthologous gene identication and methods
of detecting selection would be a plus. Also, familiar-
ity with genes of the immune system, developmental
pathways, and basic knowledge of sh biology would
be desirable. Close interactions with the other PhD
students and postdocs in the project at GEOMAR and
with our collaboration partners at the Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Synthesis (University of Oslo,
Norway) will stimulate intellectual exchange and facili-
tate collaborations. Prociency in spoken and written
English is expected.
The position is available for a funding period of three
years. The salary is up to the class E13 TV oD-Bund
of the German tari for public employees. This is a
full-time position. The position can be split.
The position is embedded in a Starting Grant from the
European Research Council focusing on male pregnancy
(MALEPREG) and is in close collaboration with the
Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis at the
University of Oslo. Several visits and longer research
stays in Oslo are planned for the successful candidate.
The genomes are already sequenced and assembled, theApril 1 2020 EvolDir 55

ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF NUPTIAL GIFTS IN
SEXUAL CONFLICT
Postdoctoral Research Position (1 year)
Salary: $43,000 per year
Applications are invited for an NSF-funded Postdoc-
toral Researcher to join the labs of Scott Sakaluk (bi-
ology.illinoisstate.edu/sksakal/Dr. Scott Sakaluk/) and
Ben Sadd (about.illinoisstate.edu/bmsadd/) in the
School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University.
The position is part of a project leveraging experimental
evolution lines in the decorated cricket Gryllodes sigilla-
tus (see Sakaluk et al. 2019) to understand the evolution
of sexual conict surrounding the provision of nuptial
food gifts. We are seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher
for a 1-year position to lead the bioinformatic analysis
of existing and future gene expression datasets, starting
May the 1st or as soon as the position can be lled.
Renewal of the position may be possible contingent on
continued external funding.
Sexual conict, in which the interests of males andfemales diverge, is widespread, and males in various
insects provide nuptial food gifts at mating that can
inuence female mating behavior, often against females'
own reproductive interests. Prior studies in decorated
crickets suggest that the food gift is an agent of sexual
conict. The current research project takes an experi-
mental evolution approach, and evaluates the eects of
intensied sexual selection on the chemistry of gifts and
their ecacy in evoking female behavioral and physio-
logical responses. Behavioral studies are ongoing, but
this position will focus on dierential gene expression
in females upon nuptial gift feeding and how gifts from
dierent selection line treatments inuence female tran-
scriptomic responses. The postdoctoral researcher will
set up and analyze the RNAseq data. This includes
the analysis of an existing dataset and involvement and
design and subsequent analysis of future experiments
incorporating the selection lines. Other major responsi-

independent events of male-specic modications of the
antennae into grasping traits (Rowe et al. Can. Ent.
2006). While these modications converge functionally,
there is a striking divergence in their morphology. This
project includes three primary parts:
1- Behavioural analyses of how males of three Rheumato-
bates species use their antennae to grasp females during
pre-mating struggles
2- Test, using RNA interference, the role of the gene
distal-less in these modications (Khila et al. Science
2012; Crumiere and Khila, Biology Letters 2019)

Postdoctoral Position, Integrative Modeling of Species
Range Shifts, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife,
Michigan State University
Application Review Date Extended to April 23rd!!
A postdoctoral research associate position in popu-
lation genetics and demographic modeling is avail-
able in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife
at Michigan State University. The successful ap-
plicant will join an established collaborative net-
work of researchers across ve institutions (Michigan
State University, the Morton Arboretum, the Col-
lege of Charleston, the Missouri Botanical Garden,
Mount Royal University) and contribute to an NSF-
funded project focused on quantifying species' histor-
ical range shifts using multiple data types (for more
information see: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID=1759759). Although multiple
data types contain information on species' range shifts
(i.e., fossil pollen data, occurrence data and ecologi-
cal niche models, and population genetic data) these
datasets do not always result in equivalent inferences
(e.g., on the speed of range shifts). This project seeks to
integrate these data types in a coherent analytical frame-
work to infer demographic parameters (migration rates,
population sizes, etc.), the location of glacial refugia, and
the pace of post-glacial range movement (see Hoban et
al 2019 Ecography). The statistical framework provided
by Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a ma-
jor component of the integrative modeling approaches
we are developing. Our project team currently includes
individuals with expertise in Mathematics, Statistics,
Ecology, Biogeography, and Population Genetics, and
we look forward to welcoming a new collaborator to the
project.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Genetics, Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology, Bioinformatics, or a similar eld
with demonstrated experience in population genetics
and some coding experience. In particular, experience
with programming (R, Python, C++), Approximate
Bayesian Computation, cluster computing, and/or anal-
ysis of population genomic data is desirable. Other de-
sired qualications include a strong work ethic, problem-
solving and time management skills, and experience
communicating scientic results. Applicants should58 EvolDir April 1 2020

part of the recently founded RCN-project \InvertOmics
- Phylogeny and evolution of lophotrochozoan inverte-
brates based on genomic data". The origin and evolution
of Bilateria is controversially discussed in several bio-
logical disciplines such as systematics or evolutionary
developmental biology. In one hypothesis, evolution in
Bilateria advances from a simple body organization sim-
ilar to atworms towards more complex forms several
times independently. In the other one, the evolution
progresses in the opposite direction from a complex an-
cestor more like an annelid to simple organizations by
several separate reductions. Support for one or the otherApril 1 2020 EvolDir 59
depends on the phylogeny and evolution of Lophotro-
chozoa, one of the major bilaterian taxa, but a robust
phylogeny is still lacking despite recent phylogenomic
studies. This is due to both low coverage by genomic
data and misleading biases in data of lophotrochozoan
taxa. In this project, high-quality reference genomes
shall be generated and new procedures to both ame-
liorate negative eects of biases and establish a new
support measurement, which is entirely dierent from
all recent support measurements. Due to both the large
genomic dataset and these thorough analyses, a robust
phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa shall be provided allowing
contributions to discussions about the origin and evolu-
tion of Bilateria as well as of lophotrochozoan taxa and
character traits. The aim of this PostDoc project is to
concentrate on the methodological problems of the recon-
struction of the phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa. Thegoal
is to develop a new approach to assess the support for
specic phylogenetic hypotheses and determine a priori
the best procedure to ameliorate the eect of mislead-
ing biases. Therefore, the eects of misleading biases
shall be simulated in a phylogenomic setting based on
parameter spaces derived from empirical data and also
include confounding eects of reticulate evolution, adap-
tive radiations and incomplete lineage sorting. Based
on these simulated data both a best-practice procedure
and new support measurement on how likely a recon-
structed relationship is true shall be derived. These
approaches will be used to address possible biases in the
dataset compiled from genomic data to reconstruct the
phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa (see the accompanying
advertisement for a PhD position). The Natural History
Museum has a modern DNA laboratory as well as access
to the Norwegian Supercomputer facilities. The postdoc
will be associated with the research group \Frontiers
in Evolutionary Zoology", specically Torsten Struck
(Professor of Evolutionary Genomics).
Qualication requirements - We seek a person with
strong motivation for research in phylogenomics. - The

PopulationGenetics
Two post-doctoral positions in Population Genetics and
Quantitative Genetics at Institut Pasteur in Paris60 EvolDir April 1 2020
The Quintana-Murci laboratory (Unit of Human Evo-
lutionary Genetics, CNRS UMR2000) is recruiting two
post-doctoral researchers in population genetics and
computational biology at Institut Pasteur, Paris. Our
research is focused on how natural selection, human
demography and lifestyle have shaped the patterns of
diversity of the human genome, to understand how this
may impact phenotype variation and disease. Speci-
cally, our projects aim to increase our understanding of
(i) the demography history of human populations, with
a focus on Africa and the Pacic, (ii) the occurrence of
natural selection, in its dierent forms, and the relation-
ship between population demography and the burden of
deleterious alleles; (iii) the genetic and epigenetic deter-
minants of immunity-related traits, with an emphasis
on molecular phenotypes; and (iv) the relationship be-
tween genetic diversity, epigenetic patterns and changes
in lifestyle and habitat of human populations.
The current postdoc projects will focus on:
(i) Population genetics. Dissecting the genetic and epi-
genetic history of human populations, with a focus on
demographic inference, admixture patterns, dierent
forms of genetic adaptation (polygenic adaptation and
adaptive admixture) and interactions between genetic
variation and DNA methylation. The project aims to
delineate evolutionary mechanisms that aect genetic
diversity, to obtain insight into phenotypes having partic-
ipated in human adaptation and maladaptation, thereby
aecting human health. This proposal, which combines
population genetics, computational modelling and de-
velopment of statistical frameworks, will shed light into
the genetic history of neglected populations, such as the
Yakut from Siberia and Polynesian islanders.
(ii) Quantitative genetics. Dissecting the contribution of
rare/common variants, together with other non-genetic
factors (including sex, age, lifestyle habits, latent infec-
tions, etc.) to variation in molecular phenotypes (gene
expression, alternative splicing and DNA methylation)
related to infection and immune stimulation. It aims to
dene the genetic architecture of expression phenotypes
in the context of GxE interactions, and explore the
(causal) relationships between genetic, epigenetic, and
environmental factors accounting for immune response
heterogeneity, in a cohort of 1,000 healthy individuals.
Requirements: - Ph.D. in population genetics, quan-
titative genomics, statistical genomics, bioinformatics,
or computational biology - Strong programming and
bioinformatics skills (R and Bash scripting, cluster com-
puting) - Prociency in English.
Duration: 2 years funding are available, and support will
be provided to become self-nanced through competitive
fellowship applications.Application Procedure: E-mail a CV, motivation let-
ter and three reference names (in a single pdf le) to

We are seeking an exceptionally talented post-doctoral
computational biologist to join Richard Mott's group in
the UCL Genetics Institute.
A fundamental question is how the control of protein
expression in plants diers from that of gene expression,
and under what circumstances is variation in protein
abundance a more relevant driver of phenotype. To this
end, we will resequence the genomes of a large Arabidop-
sis population, and then measure the epigenomes (DNA
methylation and open chromatin), transcriptomes and
proteomes in the same individuals. Your role will be to
interpret the data and answer these questions.
You will be expert in bioinformatics, quantitative ge-
netics, and in the analysis of dierent types of sequence
data, with a proven track-record from publications. The
post is a key part of a major 5-year BBSRC programme
BB/T002182/1 to understand the relative impacts of
genetic, sequence, epigenetic, transcriptomic and pro-
teomic variation on phenotype in the plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. The project is a collaboration between UCL,

GutMicrobiomeEvolution
Postdoc in Ecological Hologenomics at The GLOBE
Institute We are looking for a highly motivated and
dynamic researcher for a 3-year position to work on
studying the relationship between ecological niches and
gut microbiomes of vertebrates integrating eld work,
spatial and molecular analyses at the Centre for Evolu-
tionary Hologenomics, GLOBE Institute, University of
Copenhagen.
The continuous interaction between hosts and microor-
ganisms associated with them is known to shape and
even drive many biological processes of complex or-
ganisms, including vertebrates. The capacity to host
dierent microbial communities (metagenomic space)
as well as to enable or promote community variation
(metagenomic plasticity) can shape multiple biological
features of complex organisms. Current molecular and
spatial methods enable nuanced analyses of microbiota
composition and variation across physical, ecological
and phylogenetic spaces, which could contribute to cast
further light into the relationship between gut microor-
ganisms and ecological features of their hosts.
In this regard, your position would be working
alongside the research groups of Assoc Prof Ant-
ton Alberdi, and Prof Tom Gilbert on studying
how metagenomic space varies among vertebrate in-
dividuals/populations/species/clades, by estimating the
metagenomic spaces of 10 closely related species pairs in
light of their ecological and genomic features. Metage-
nomic space and plasticity of host-associated microor-
ganisms will be measured through extensive eldwork
across animals' full distribution ranges. In a second
phase, captivity experiments in which environmental
factors will be modied will be conducted with selected
species to better approximate species' metagenomic
spaces, and directly measure metagenomic plasticity.
This project is embedded within the Earth HoloGenome
Initiative, which you will also contribute to by managing
sampling logistics, sample processing and data analysis.
Your tasks would therefore be research, including pub-
lication/scientic communication of research results,
project management, as well as research-based teaching.

3817591jNg&LANG=USA About the role
Host-parasite interactions oer fascinating opportunities
to study coevolution, local adaptation and rapid evolu-
tionary change. Our work uses a unique experimental
system of up to 50 species of Drosophila and naturally
occurring RNA viruses to ask fundamental questions
about pathogen host shifts 'V where a pathogen jumps
from one host species to another. Host shifts are a major
source of emerging infectious diseases, with HIV, Ebola
virus and SARS coronavirus having all jumped into hu-
mans from other host species. By taking a comparative
approach, with a strong set of hypotheses from ecologi-
cal and evolutionary theory, we can provide insights into
the factors underlying host shifts that will be generally
applicable to any group of hosts or viruses.
Understanding pathogen host shifts is critical, especially
in light of environmental change. Our model system
has provided key insights into host shifts, namely the
importance of genetic similarity between hosts. Based
on work in Drosophila melanogaster, we know the inter-
actions between host antiviral immunity and the ability
of the virus to supress this immune response, can play
a role in explaining dierences in susceptibility. The
initial aim of the postdoc is to examine why virusescan infect some hosts and not others by looking at how
the viral suppressor of immunity functions in dierent
host species, and how this inuences patterns of suscep-
tibility across the host phylogeny, but there are many
opportunities to develop new projects to explore the
ecology and evolution of pathogen host shifts.
Applicants will possess a relevant PhD or equivalent
qualication/experience in a related eld of study.
The successful applicant will be responsible for leading
experimental work, data collection and analysis, working
closely with the PI and collaborators. The post will be
based at the University of Exeter in the internationally
excellent Centre for Conservation and Ecology
https://www.exeter.ac.uk/cornwall/research/-
facilitiesandcentres/cec/. The centre has a huge
number of researchers working in ecology and evolution,

host-parasite interactions (including Prof Angus
Buckling, Prof Camille Bonneaud, Prof Edze Westra,
Prof Robbie McDonald, Dr Alex Hayward and Dr
Stineke Van Houte) and provides an exciting and
stimulating research environment.
Please highlight in your cover letter why you would
like to work in our group (www.benlongdon.com),
why you are interested in this project, and how your
skillset/experience is relevant. If you think you might
be a great t for this position but are unsure on whether
you have relevant experience, please get in touch before
applying, happy to consider applicants from dierent

Project descriptions in brief:
Project 1. Despite the importance of recombination
in determining the faith of novel mutations and seg-
regating alleles, our understanding of the mechanisms
determining where in the genome recombination occurs,
and the evolutionary consequences of regional variation
in recombination rate, is limited to a small set of model
organisms. The proposed project aim is therefore to
characterize the ne-scale recombination landscape in
wood white (Leptidea sp.) buttery populations with
dramatic karyotype variation. The data will be used to
assess:
1) the conservation/turnover rate of the recombination
landscape in holocentric organisms and if recombination
is associated to any specic genomic features2) the eect of regional recombination rate variation on
maintenance/loss of genetic diversity
3) the eect of recombination on the evolutionary rates
of sex chromosomes and autosomes when recombination
is restricted to the male germline
4) the eect of chromosome ssions/fusions on the global
recombination landscape and the adaptive potential of
populations
Project 2. Migration is a widespread phenomenon in
animals. It is a behavior that allows organisms to adapt
to variation in resource availability throughout the year,
but migration can also be associated with high risks.
The study of evolutionary advantages of migration and
the cost-benet balance associated with this behavior
is specially needed in insects, for which our knowledge
to date is very limited. A fundamental dierence exists
between vertebrate and insect migrations. As opposed
to vertebrates, insect migrations are often multigenera-
tional, meaning that not the same individuals, but their
ospring complete migratory circuits. Migratory strate-
gies vary signicantly and may include long and/or short
distances, seasonal diapause or year-round migrations,
and dierent numbers of generations can be involved.
In this project, the aim is to develop a theoretical mod-
elling approach to characterize the impact of migratory
behavior on maintenance/loss/gain of genetic diversity
for a variety of migratory strategies found in butter-
ies. The modelling will be combined with analysis
of large-scale population genomic data with particular
focus on the painted lady (Vanessa cardui), a nearly
cosmopolitan species with complex migratory patterns.

See full description and how to apply here: https://-
www.uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/details/?positionId=-
322255 Closing date: April 10, 2020
Project description: How have eukaryotes diversied
over geological time and across large geographic re-
gions? In this project, we aim to look at this broad and
important question by combining aspects of macroevo-
lution and macroecology to better understand patterns
of microbial eukaryote diversity and the processes that
led to this diversity. The focus organisms are microbial
eukaryotes (protists), which represent the vast bulk of
eukaryotic diversity in all environments. In the last
decade, the study of protist diversity and distribution
has been dramatically improved by high-throughput
metabarcoding. While powerful to reveal novel diver-
sity, this approach is typically limited by its current
low phylogenetic resolution. To overtake this limitation,
we have recently developed an approach that makes
use of long-read sequencing (PacBio) to generate much
longer sequences ( ~5000pb) directly from environmental
samples (Jamy et al. 2019. Longread metabarcoding
of the eukaryotic rDNA operon to phylogenetically and
taxonomically resolve environmental diversity. Mol Ecol
Resour). This approach oers the key advantage to
improve the phylogenetic resolution of environmental
diversity, thus allowing to eciently address evolution-
ary and ecological questions especially when combined
to the much wider breadth of short-read data already
available. In this project, we will analyse a large dataset
of long environmental reads that we have generated
from a wide array of environments (marine and lake
environments, tropical and boreal soils, bogs, etc).
Duties: Most of the work will be bioinformatic in na-
ture since the main datasets are either already available.
Thus, the main duties are to perform bioinformatic
analyses within the broad framework of this project,
compile and disseminate the results orally and in writ-ing in scientic publications. Importantly, while the
general framework is dened, we encourage participa-
tion and independence of the position's holder to develop
specic lines of inquiry in consultation with the super-
visor. Training of junior group members might also be
involved, as well as other standard tasks related to a
research group.
Requirements: To qualify for an employment as a post-
doctor you must have a PhD degree or a foreign degree
equivalent to a PhD degree in Biology or equivalent.
The PhD degree must have been obtained no more than
three years prior to the application deadline. The three
year period can be extended due to circumstances such
as sick leave, parental leave, duties in labour unions,
etc. Highly motivated, enthusiastic and hard-working
individual with strong academic prociency within the
elds of microbial eukaryote evolution and/or ecology.
We are looking for a candidate with an open-minded,
cooperative attitude, who can work both independently
and in a team. Documented experience in analysis of
high-throughput metabarcoding datasets of environmen-
tal DNA and phylogenetics is required. Experience with
biogeographical approaches and phylogeography is de-
sired, as well as experience with Bayesian methods for
character evolution. You should be procient on the
command line and with an advanced knowledge of at
least one scripting language and R. Fluent in English
both in spoken and written.
Additional qualications: Although this position is cen-
tered around bioinformatic methods, visualisation tech-
niques of environmental diversity might be desirable.
Thus, experience with uorescence in-situ hybridization
(FISH) methods will be seen as an asset.
Terms of employment: The position involves full-time
employment for a maximum of two years, with the pos-
sibility of extension under special circumstances. Start
date: June 1, 2020, or as otherwise agreed
Contact: Further information about the position can be
obtained from Dr. Fabien Burki, telephone: +46 18-471

rina.mugal@ebc.uu.se
Project description: Stochastic models have a strong
tradition in population genetics. Diusion and branch-
ing processes are frequently used to describe evolution
forward-in-time. At the same time, birth-death pro-
cesses such as the coalescent are used to track evolu-
tion backward-in-time. Duality relationships between
forward-in-time and backward-in-time models have been
established and analysed. Together, such mathematical
treatment has led to a large body of theoretical popula-
tion genetics and promoted our general understanding
of evolution.
Building on concepts of theoretical population genet-
ics, we have formulated a time-dependent Poisson ran-
dom eld model that permits describing allele fre-
quency trajectories in nonstationary populations (doi:
10.1016/j.tpb.2016.06.003). This has, for example, en-abled us to formulate an analytical description of the
joint allele frequency spectrum of two populations dur-
ing the process of speciation, and investigate the impact
of incomplete lineage sorting on genomic signatures of
natural selection.
The project prots from an interdisciplinary collabora-
tion between the Department of Ecology and Genetics
and the Department of Mathematics at Uppsala Univer-
sity.
Duties: Several extensions of the basic model of allele
frequency evolution are of interest, such as dependence
among allele frequency trajectories due to physical link-
age and recombination. A relevant body of population
genetics models that address recombination exists the
sequential Markovian coalescent, the ancestral recom-
bination graph and diverse branching process models.
The Postdoc project will start by investigating possibil-
ities of integrating such models of recombination into
the forward-in-time model of allele frequency evolution,
which has been formulated by our group. In particu-
lar, analytical results on the allele frequency spectrum
(AFS) in the presence of physical linkage are of interest.
Ultimately, the derivation of such an AFS shall form
the basis to analytically investigate the relationship be-
tween the recombination rate and measures of natural
selection, which is a central question in evolutionary
biology.
Qualications required: For this position, the candidate
must hold a PhD degree within mathematics, evolu-
tionary biology, bioinformatics or another relevant eld.
The Postdoc candidate must have experience in mathe-
matical biology and interest in population genetics. The
candidate must be able to express themselves uently
in spoken as well as written English. In addition, the
applicant must be able to work independently, have
good collaborative skills and be able to communicate
(both spoken as well as written). The applicant must
have integrity and personal maturity, be able to take
initiative and to handle setbacks.
To be eligible the candidate must have a PhD degree, or
a foreign degree equivalent to this, completed less than
three years before the application deadline. The three
year period can be extended due to circumstances such
as sick leave, parental leave, duties in labour unions,
etc.

tations, whether it ultimately xes the causative vari-
ants. We focus on local adaptation among Drosophila
melanogaster populations from contrasting natural envi-
ronments, which provides a powerful and ecient system
for investigating these questions. One particular oppor-
tunity is to make statistical inferences about the genetic
architecture of adaptation, in part from existing QTL
mapping data.
* Fundamental Population Genetics We are interested
in leveraging big data (such the >1000 genomes from
our Drosophila Genome Nexus) to ask basic population
genetic questions. Our lab is especially interested in
leveraging genetic dierentiation between populations
to address classic but unresolved questions about the
inuence of natural selection on genomic diversity.
* Quantifying Adaptive Potential It is widely recog-
nized that genetic diversity is a primary determinant
of whether populations can rapidly adapt to new chal-
lenges. Yet in spite of its relevance to basic evolutionary
biology and conservation, our understanding of adaptive
potential is still quite lacking. Our lab is interested
in which types of genetic diversity are most important
for adaptive potential (e.g. within vs. between popula-
tion) and how best to quantitatively estimate adaptive76 EvolDir April 1 2020
potential within and among populations.

Amphipods are among the most common invertebrates
in streams, rivers and lakes. They play a key role in
the functioning of these ecosystems and are regularly
used for monitoring and bioindication. While the di-
versity and distribution of the epigean (above ground)
amphipods is well documented, there is a signicant and
largely unknown diversity of amphipods in hypogean
(below ground) habitats. The project AmphiWell will
establish scientic baseline data about the diversity
and distribution of amphipods (especially genus Niphar-
gus) in Swiss groundwaters. The Postdoc project willApril 1 2020 EvolDir 77
establish eDNA metabarcoding methods to monitor
groundwater from a biological perspective. The tools
will be developed in close collaboration with respec-
tive stakeholders, such that they can be directly used
and implemented by water providers. The project is
aligned with a parallel PhD project that focuses on
biogeography and species diversity of amphipods in
groundwater. Goals of the Postdoc project are: 1) Es-
tablish environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques as a
monitoring tool for groundwater amphipods to t into
existing drinking water monitoring frameworks. 2) Us-
ing a metabarcoding eDNA approach to describe whole
communities of groundwater habitats (e.g. including
molluscs, isopods, possibly bacteria). 3) Analyse the
occurrence of groundwater amphipods with respect to
chemical parameters/descriptors of the groundwater.
The postdoctoral fellow will use our established collec-
tion of groundwater amphipods (genus Niphargus sp.)
to build a reference barcode library, develop appropri-
ate primers for eDNA analyses, and plan, conduct and
analyse an eDNA sampling campaign in collaboration
with drinking water providers to assess biodiversity of
groundwater amphipods. The project builds on exist-
ing data from an ongoing project (www.amphipod.ch).
The project is co-funded by the Swiss Federal Oce for
the Environment (BAFU/FOEN) and some interest in
stakeholder interactions would be wanted. Competitive
applicants have previous experience in eDNA analyses,
metabarcoding and bioinformatics. Strong expertise in
spatial ecology, biodiversity sciences and statistics is
desired. Applicants will be highly motivated, enthu-
siastic and independent scientists. They must have a
good conceptual understanding of ecological theory and
strong laboratory skills. Excellent communicational and
writing skills in English, experiences with publishing
scientic articles, good work ethics, and creative think-
ing are a must. A PhD in Ecology or related subject is
necessary for admission.
To apply, you must have a PhD degree in Ecology, Molec-
ular Ecology or a closely related science eld and should
have a valid driver licence. The successful applicant
will be based in the group of Prof. Dr. Florian Al-
termatt (www.altermattlab.ch) at Eawag and UZH in

BielefeldU EnvironmentalChange
Dear evoldir community,
Understanding and managing the ecological conse-
quences of global environmental change is a key chal-
lenge for the 21st century. Starting in fall 2020, Bielefeld
University is oering a new Master programme Ecology
and Environmental Change. The Master programme
brings together dierent elds of ecology (animal and
plant ecology, chemical ecology, conservation ecology
and theoretical evolutionary ecology) to explore how
individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems
respond and adapt to environmental change.
Over the course of the Master programme, students learn
to design and conduct laboratory and eld experiments,
acquire chemical-analytical methods, learn how to build
eco-evolutionary models, and strengthen their statisti-
cal analysis and scientic communication skills. In the
rst year, students take classes including Ecosystem
Wadden Sea (with excursion), Environmental change
and chemical communication, Models in conservation
biology, Animal Ecology in a changing world, Eects of
environmental change on plant chemistry, Plant ecology
in a changing environment, Nature conservation and
environmental protection (with excursion). The second
year consists of individual research modules and the
Master thesis.
All classes are taught in English and international appli-
cants are very welcome! German skills are not required,
but free German classes are oered for students at Biele-
feld University.
The application deadline is July 15, 2020.

Advanced Python for biologists (APYB04)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/advanced-
python-biologists-apyb04/ This course will be delivered
by Dr Martin Jones from the 29th June - 3rd Julyin
Glasgow City Centre.
Course overview:Python is a dynamic, readable language
that is a popular platform for all types of bioinformatics
work, from simple one-o scripts to large, complex soft-
ware projects. This workshop is aimed at people who
already have a basic knowledge of Python and are in-
terested in using the language to tackle larger problems.
In it, we will look in detail at the parts of the language
which are particularly useful in scientic programming,
and at the tools Python oers for making development
faster and easier. The course will use examples and
exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics
work. After completing the workshop, students should
be in a position to (1) take advantage of the advanced82 EvolDir April 1 2020
language features in their own programs and (2) use
appropriate tools when developing software programs.

Python for data science, machine learning, and scientic
computing (PDMS02)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/python-for-
data-science-machine-learning-and-scientic-computing-
pdms02/ This course will be delivered by Dr Mark
Andrews from the4th - 8th May in Glasgow City
Centre.
Course Overview:Python is one of the most widely used
and highly valued programming languages in the world,
and is especially widely used in data science, machine
learning, and in other scientic computing applications.
This course provides both a general introduction to pro-
gramming with Python and a comprehensive introduc-
tion to using Python for data science, machine learning,
and scientic computing. The major topics that we
will cover include the following: the fundamentals of
general purpose programming in Python; using Jupyter
notebooks as a reproducible interactive Python program-
ming environment; numerical computing using numpy;
data processing and manipulations using pandas; data
visualization using matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot, bokeh,
altair, etc; symbolic mathematics using sympy; data sci-
ence and machine learning using scikit-learn, keras, and
tensorow; Bayesian modelling using PyMC3 and PyS-
tan; high performance computing with Cython, Numba,
IPyParallel, Dask. Overall, this course aims to provide a
solid introduction to Python generally as a programming
language, and to its principal tools for doing data sci-
ence, machine learning, and scientic computing. (Note
that this course will focus on Python 3 exclusively given
that Python 2 has now reached it end of life).

Bioinformatics with Linux and Python (BILP01)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/bioinformatics-
with-linux-and-python-bilp01/ This course will be
delivered by Dr Martin Jones from the11th-15th May
in Glasgow City
CentreCourse Overview:A fundamental part of bioin-
formatics (in contrast to simply computational biology)
is the idea of scaling and automation. We want to ar-
range our tools into pipelines which can be executed
with minimal supervision. Reliable automation of this
type is key to many of the things that we want from
our analyses; chiey the ability to reproduce our results,
and to extend them to other datasets.In this course we
will examine two dierent systems for automating bioin-
formatic analyses. For situations where we are mostlyrunning existing command line tools, bash scripting
will allow us to build pipelines with minimal overhead.
We'll start with simple command lines and see how the
Linux environment ' though not designed with biology
in mind ' is well suited to the type of automation we
need.For situations where we don't have an existing
tool available, and hence need to implement our own
logic, bash quickly becomes unwieldy ' it's theoretically
possible to write complex programs in bash, but the
experience is painful! It's much better to use a more
modern programming language, and for most biological
tasks Python ts the bill.

Update due to COVID-19: We are currently still plan-
ning to go ahead with the workshop. In mid-June we
will make a nal decision, based on how the situation
develops.
Abstract submission is now open for the above meeting,
to be held at Kloster Lehnin, close to Berlin, Germany.
For more information and abstract submission pleaseApril 1 2020 EvolDir 83
see here: https://fu-berlin.de/xmed313 The meeting is
the next installment in a loose series of workshops on
ecological & evolutionary immunology / insect immu-
nity, that started in 2001 in Sheeld, the most recent
one being in Blossin (close to Berlin) in 2017. These
meetings bring together researchers with dierent back-
grounds but with a shared interest in immunity and
host-microbe interactions, and where we encourage the
presentation of unpublished results.
The hallmark of these workshops is the open atmosphere,
fostering free exchange by keeping it an aordable, small
meeting ( ~85 participants). The format consists of in-
vited speakers, contributed talks and a dedicated poster
session. Long breaks provide plenty of opportunity for
informal exchange. Past workshops have initiated new
collaborations and ideas focusing on frontier research.
The premises are basic but in a beautiful location con-
ducive to the success of the meeting. We will be located
at a lakeside, which during August oers great swim-
ming and canoeing, and a small caf e on the lakeside.
Our invited speakers are: Alex Best (University of
Sheeld, UK) Nicholas Buchon (Cornell University,
USA) Delphine Destoumieux-Garzon (University of
Montpellier, France) Laura Fl orez (University of Mainz,
Germany) Andrea Graham (Princeton University, USA)

Course Overview: This course provides a general intro-
duction to nonlinear regression analysis, covering major
topics including, but not limited to, general and gener-
alized linear models, generalized additive models, spline
and radial basis function regression, and Gaussian pro-
cess regression. All of these methods are encountered fre-
quently in the analysis of evolutionary/biological data.
We approach the general topic of nonlinear regression
by showing how the powerful and exible statistical
modelling framework of general and generalized linear
models, and their multilevel counterparts, can be ex-
tended to handle nonlinear relationships between pre-
dictor and outcome variables. We begin by providing
a comprehensive practical and theoretical overview of
regression, including multilevel regression, using general
and generalized linear models. Here, we pay particular
attention to the many variants of general and general-
ized linear models, and how these provide a very widely
applicable set of tools for statistical modeling. After
this introduction, we then proceed to cover practically
and conceptually simple extensions to the general and
generalized linear models framework using parametric
nonlinear models and polynomial regression. We will
then cover more powerful and exible extensions of this
modeling. framework by way of the general concept
of basis functions. We'll begin our coverage of basis
function regression with the major topic of spline regres-
sion, and then proceed to cover radial basis functions
and the multilayer perceptron, both of which are types
of articial neural networks. We then move on to the
major topic of generalized additive models (GAMs) andApril 1 2020 EvolDir 85
generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), which
can be viewed as the generalization of all the basis func-
tion regression topics, but cover a wider range of topic
including nonlinear spatial and temporal models and
interaction models. Finally, we will cover the power-
ful Bayesian nonlinear regression method of Gaussian
process regression.
Monday 25th ' Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Module 1:
General and generalized linear models, including mul-
tilevel models. In order to provide a solid foundation
for the remainder of the course, we begin by providing
a comprehensive practical and theoretical overview of
the principles of general and generalized linear models,
also covering their multilevel (or hierarchical) counter-
parts. General and generalized linear models provide
a powerful set of tools for statistical modeling., which
are extremely widely used and widely applicable. Their
underlying theoretical principles are quite simple and
elegant, and once understood, it becomes clear how
these models can be extended in many dierent ways
to handle dierent statistical modeling. situations.
For this module, we will use the very commonly used
R tools such as lm, glm, lme4::lmer, lme4::glmer. In
addition, we will also use the R based brms package,
which uses the Stan probabilistic programming language.
This package allows us to perform all the same analyses
that are provided by lm, glm, lmer, glmer, etc., using an
almost identical syntax, but also us to perform a much
wider range of general and

concepts and demonstrating good practice in hierarchi-
cal models. All methods are demonstrated with data
sets which participants can run themselves. Participants
will be taught how to t hierarchical models using the
Bayesian modelling software Jags and Stan through the
R software interface. The course covers the full gamut
from simple regression models through to full gener-
alised multivariate hierarchical structures. A Bayesian
approach is taken throughout, meaning that participants
can include all available information in their models and
estimates all unknown quantities with uncertainty. Par-

Online LandscapeGenomics Jun8-12
Dear all,
due to the current COVID-19 outbreak, we de-
cided to move the Landscape Genomics online:
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course17/ )
When: 8-12 June 2020
Instructors: Dr. St ephane Joost and Dr. Elia Vajana
(EPFL, Lausanne, CH)
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, the course
will discuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic
data and subsequently show how to study genetic vari-
ation and population structure across space in the R
environment. Students will be given an overview of thedierent statistical approaches to study local adapta-
tion, and will be trained in using two of them, Sambada
and LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task
of the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-
nally, the workshop will consider the crucial aspects and
good habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).

ONLINE PopulationGenomics
May18-22
Dear all,
the 5th edition of the Population Genomics course
will be held online: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course9/ Instructors: Dr. Martin
Taylor and Dr. Lewis Spurgin (University of East Anglia,
UK)
The course will cover the basics of population genomic
analysis from SNP data onwards and will cover the key
analyses that may be required to successfully analyze
a population genetic data set. The course will NOT
cover steps prior to generation of a .vcf le or SNP
data set such as NGS data demultiplexing, clustering
and SNP calling (This is covered in detail in the Intro-
duction to RADseq course). This course will introduce
Linux and the command line environment, basic perl
and python usage, le conversions and manipulation,
population structure and dierentiation in R, outlier
analysis, landscape / seascape genomics and introgres-
sion. The course will use a range of software including
the Linux operating system and R.
This course is aimed at postgraduate students and early
career researchers who are interested in using population
genomic tools in their research. No previous experience
of bioinformatics is required, but an underpinning in
evolutionary biology and basic population genetics con-
cepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and FST areApril 1 2020 EvolDir 87
desirable.
Having completed the course, students should have a
good understanding of the software and methods avail-
able for population genomic analysis and be competent
in population genomic analysis.

QuebecCity SeascapeGenomics
Oct12-16
Course: Seascape Genomics
Where: Laval University, Quebec City (Canada)
When: 12-16 October 2020
Instructors: Dr. Laura Benestan (University of Mont-
pellier, FR) and Oliver Selmoni (EPFL, CH)
In this course , students will learn the basics of this ap-
proach and train using state of the art methods. Firstly,
students will learn how to extract environmental data
from publicly available databases and how to use it to
characterize the seascape structure and conditions. For
instance, students will learn how to use remote sensing
data to describe sea water temperature oscillations or
sea water movements. Next, the course will bring its
focus on genomic analyses: students will learn how to
evaluate genetic structures in the marine environment
and how to calculate and display connectivity between
populations. The combination of environmental and
genomic data will also lead to the study of local adapta-
tion. Students will learn dierent methods to discover
genetic/genomic signatures potentially involved in adap-
tation against specic environmental constraints. The
course will also cover the critical task of the interpre-
tation and validation of the results, particularly in an
applied conservation and management context. Finally,
the workshop will consider the crucial aspects and good
habits to account for designing a seascape genomics ex-
periment (e.g. sampling design) from a relevant scientic
question.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note thatApril 1 2020 EvolDir 89
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
