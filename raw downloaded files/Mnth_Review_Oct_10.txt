Dear colleagues,
Just a reminder that the international symposium
“Frontiers in Biodiversity: a Phylogenetic Perspective”,
will be held in Barcelona, Spain, in three weeks from
today (1st and 2nd of October 2010). There are still
some seats available for registration and few slots left
for poster presentations.
For further information please visit http://-
www.phylofrontiers2010.com/ (please, ﬁnd below
the original posted message)
Hope to see you in Barcelona!
The organizing committee: Miquel A. Arnedo, Marta
Riutort and Julio Rozas (Biodiversity Research Insti-
tute, University of Barcelona), and Salvador Carranza,
Jose Castresana and Ignacio Ribera (Evolutionary Bi-
ology Institute, CSIC-University Pompeu Fabra)
>>The symposium is co-organized by the Biodiversity
Research Institute of the University of Barcelona (Ir-
Bio), the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE, CSIC-
UPF) and the Zoological Systematics and Evolution re-
search group on the occasion of the International year
of Biodiversity.
These are exciting times to conduct research on Bio-diversity. The last years have witnessed the develop-
ment of new theoretical, computational and technolog-
ical tools for Biodiversity research at an unprecedented
rate. The symposium aims to explore the impact of
some of these new conceptual and methodological ap-
proaches on our current understanding of the origins
and the processes that shape Biodiversity. Research on
Biodiversity has multiple facets. In this symposium we
will emphasize the perspective and contributions com-
ing form the phylogenetic and phylogeographic front.
The symposium will focus on a selected list of “hot
topics” under the headings of Statistical phylogenetics
and phylogeography, Biogeography, Time, Key Innova-
tions, Adaptive radiations, Diversiﬁcation, Community
phylogenetics and Phylogenomics.
The symposium will consist of two morning sessions
with invited talks and an afternoon poster session open
to participants. The symposium will close with a round
table with the invited speakers on the topic “Biodiver-
sity in the omics era”. The list of conﬁrmed speakers
include Richard Brown (Liverpool John Moores Uni-
versity, UK), Fr´ ed´ eric Delsuc (Universit´ e Montpellier
II, France), Steven W. Kembel (University of Oregon,
US), L. Lacey Knowles (University of Michigan, US),
Brian R. Moore (University of California, Davis, US),
Daniel L. Rabosky (University of California, Berkeley,
US), Isabel Sanmartin (Real Jardin Botanico, CSIC,
Spain) and Ziheng Yang (University College London,
UK).
The symposium will be held at the Institute of CatalanOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 3
Studies (Institut d’Estudis Catalans, IEC), located at
the heart of Barcelona’s old town, in the 17th century
Santa Creu Hospital building.
The registration fee is 80EUR. There is no deadline
for registration and poster abstract submission, but at-
tendance will be limited to 100 participants and the
number of posters to 30. Both registration and poster
contributions will be accepted on ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served
basis, and will close once we reach the maximum num-
ber of contributors.

Dear colleague,
Speciation 2010, theﬁrst European conference on spe-
ciation research, will take place in Laxenburg, near Vi-
enna, Austria, during December 13-15, 2010. We would
be most grateful to you if you could kindlyshare this in-
formation with potentially interested colleaguesin your
research group or department.
The conference will be held in the former summer
palace of the Habsburg family, home of the Interna-
tional Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),
and will be organized as part of the European Science
Foundation’s Research Networking Programme Fron-
tiers of Speciation Research (FroSpects), funded by 18
national research agencies.
The aim of Speciation 2010 is to bridge between dif-
ferent approaches to speciation research and to pro-
mote integrative perspectives that interface empirical
insights with theoretical advances and bring together
developments in ecology, systematics, and genetics. In-
dicative topics include, but are not limited to, the di-
versity of diversiﬁcation processes, signatures of speci-
ation, species cohesion, speciation models for speciﬁc
systems, the role of interspeciﬁc interactions, specia-
tion and bioinvasions, hybridization and adaptive radi-
ations, genetics and genomics of speciation, biodiversity
losses through reverse speciation, speciation in ecosys-
tems, evolutionary biogeography, and macro-ecological
explanations of biodiversity.
Participation is open to everyone. Thanks to supportby ESF and IIASA, we only charge a small registration
fee to cover lunches, coﬀee breaks, and bus transfers.
In addition to about 20 invited presentations, the con-
ference will feature contributed talks and a poster ses-
sion. Conﬁrmed invited speakers include Nick Barton,
Austria; Louis Bernatchez, Canada; Dan Bolnick, USA;
Jerry Coyne, USA; Tatiana Giraud, France; Andrew
Hendry, Canada; Chris Jiggins, UK; Kerstin Johan-
nesson, Sweden; Eva Kisdi, Finland; Isabelle Olivieri,

Lund GeneticsMigration Dec6
CAnMove symposium ˆ a Genetics of Migration Centre
for Animal Movement, Lund University, 6th December
2010
The aim of this symposium is to provide a plenum for
scientists to present key studies and state-of-the-art in-
sight into the ﬁeld of migration covering diﬀerent taxa
and using various approaches. We want to provide a
platform to merge and discuss the current state of the
ﬁeld of genetics of migration and identify future di-
rections and methodological approaches to be focused
upon.
The symposium will be centred on a backbone of sixtalks presenting case studies across a variety of taxa,
and introducing diﬀerent methodological approaches.
We will close the symposium with a plenary discus-
sion to synthesise future directions, methodological ap-
proaches, and assess possibilities and pitfalls thereof.
With this symposium we hope to encourage dialogue
and the exchange of ideas, and to foster collaboration
and promote debate.
Registration: Attendance of the symposium is free,
if you want to attend, please register here. The
deadline for applications is October 22nd. (Link
to online-registration: http://canmove-dev.ekol.lu.se/-

12th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS FORUM
Wednesday 1 December 2010, starting at 9 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre, Natural History Mu-
seum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists Forum represents an
exciting setting for postgraduate students and young
postdoctoral researchers to present their data, often
for the ﬁrst time, to a scientiﬁc audience interested
in taxonomy, systematics and phylogenetics. This
well-established event provides an important oppor-October 1, 2010 EvolDir 9
tunity for budding systematists to discuss their re-
search in front of their peers within a supportive en-
vironment. Supervisors and other established system-
atists are also encouraged to attend. Note that this
Forum is held the day after the Molluscan Forum
(www.Malacsoc.org.uk ), also at the Natural History
Museum. This has been arranged so that both meetings
can be attended.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE. Send applications by e-mail to
David Bass (d.bass@nhm.ac.uk), supplying your name,
contact address and stating whether or not you wish
to give an oral or poster presentation. Space will be
allocated subject to availability and for a balanced pro-
gramme of animal, plant, algal, microbial, molecular,
and other research. Non-participating attendees are
also very welcome - please register as above.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than 15th November 2010. The body text should
not exceed 150 words in length. If the presentation
is co-authored, the actual speaker (oral) or presenter
(poster) must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
All registered attendants will receive by e-mail fur-
ther information about the meeting, including ab-
stracts, one week in advance. This information will
also be displayed on the Systematics Association web-
site ( www.systass.org ).

PuertoRico EvolutionClimate
Feb11-18
Dear colleagues and friends,
We would like to invite you to attend to our session
on our “Evolutionary rules in the brave new ocean -
Climate change and life-history strategies” session (see
below for description) at the upcoming ASLO Aquatic
Sciences Meeting, being held 11-18 February 2011 in
San Juan, Puerto Rico. The deadline for submission
is the 11 October 2010. For more information and
abstract submission, please visit the meeting website:
http://www.aslo.org/meetings/sanjuan2011/ Please donot hesitate to contact me if you have any question re-
garding the session. Looking forward meeting you in
Puerto Rico for stimulating discussions on life-history
and climate change.
Best regards Sam Dupont, Frank Melzner and Mike
Thorndyke Sam.dupont@marecol.gu.se;
–
Session Description: Among anthropogenic stressors,
global warming and ocean acidiﬁcation - the decrease
in the pH of the oceans caused by their uptake of
anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere -
are of great concern and are believed to be a ma-
jor threat for near-future ecosystem health. Rates of
change are increasingly fast and we can only guess at
the kinds of organisms that will suﬀer (“losers”) or ben-
eﬁt (“winners”) from this mayhem that is radically al-
tering ecosystem structure. The aim of this session is to
summarize recent ﬁndings suggesting that a life-history
strategy is a major parameter determining species sen-
sitivity. A variety of life history strategies exist that
enable marine species to reproduce successfully across
a wide range of habitats. These include planktotro-
phy, lecitothrophy, brooding, asexual reproduction, hy-
bridization, etc. The proportion of each strategy is
believed to be a consequence of a range of selective
pressures and recent ﬁndings suggest that these rules
may be change in near-future oceans. To understand
near-future ocean, we need to understand these new
evolutionary rules that will shape ecosystems.

SYMPOSIUM: Genes & Environment: Finding the
Missing Heritability of Complex Traits
Stanford University, October 14 & 15, 2010
Generously supported by Society in Science, theBranco Weiss Fellowship - http://www.society-in-
science.ethz.ch/ Public registration to attend this one
and a half day symposium is now open at http://-
www.gxe2010.org - admission is FREE and will be han-
dled on a “ﬁrst come ﬁrst serve” basis. Space is limited
and pre-registration is required.
Why is it that humans vary in their susceptibility to
major diseases, such as cancer, depression, schizophre-
nia, and HIV/AIDS? What determines complex human
traits? Is it genes, the environment, a combination of
both, or something else? These questions lie at the
heart of a debate that has been raging for decades,
namely the nature vs. nurture debate. Modern tech-
nology has allowed us to dig deep into the genetic varia-
tion in human populations and associate that variation
with traits of interest. However, the results of these so-
called genome wide association studies (GWAS) have
been sobering: While some traits are clearly associated
with particular genetic variants, most variation in traits
cannot be explained by variation in genes. This poses
a paradox: Many traits cluster in families, but genetic
variation seems to explain little variation. Where does
the missing heritability come from?
At Stanford University, 9 world-renowned experts on
these questions and leaders in their ﬁelds will speak at
the GxE 2010 symposium. At this one and a half day
event, talks will be alternating with moderated discus-
sion in a medium-sized setting that allows and fosters
personal interactions.

The Evolutionary Genomics Group in the Compar-
ative and Computational Genomics program of the
IBE ( http://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/ ) is willing to recruit
a PhD student.
The research group that the successful candidate will
join studies genomic variation at both the intraspe-
ciﬁc and interspeciﬁc levels in hominids. Besides
several other research projects, the group runs the
Population Genomics Node of the Spanish National
Bioinformatics Institute ( http://www.inab.org ), work-
ing in close collaboration with the National Genotyp-
ing Centre ( http://www.cegen.org ). The group is lo-
cated at the Evolutionary Biology Unit of the Pom-
peu Fabra University ( http://www.upf.edu ) and is part
of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park ( http://-
www.prbb.org ), a renowned centre for Biomedical re-
search that hosts, besides the University, other insti-
tutions such as the CRG (Centre for Genomic Regula-
tion) or the CMRB (Barcelona’s Centre for Regenera-
tive Medicine). All these organizations share a thrilling
and dynamic scientiﬁc atmosphere, driven by leading
groups in ﬁelds such as bioinformatics, molecular bi-
ology and evolution. The PRBB is located close to
Barcelona’s City Centre (right in front of the beach).
The PhD project will be directed by Dr. Tomas
Marques-Bonet.
http://www.upf.edu/ibe/research/research-groups/-

analysis and ﬁne characterization of copy number
variants in primate genomes.
Candidates should hold a Bachelor’s degree (or equiv-
alent) in Biology, Computer sciences or similar. Can-
didates with strong programming, knowledge on next-
generation sequence methods (454 and Illumina) andexperimental background are especially encouraged to
apply.

PhD position in evolutionary ecology at Colorado State
University
The Hufbauer lab is ﬁlling PhD position in evolution-
ary biology to work on a collaborative project between
CSU and CU Boulder at the interface of demography,
modeling and ecological genetics.
The project focuses on the contributions of demogra-
phy and genetics in the founding and spread of new
populations, combining a model biological system (Tri-
bolium ﬂour beetles) and quantitative models. The stu-
dent at CSU will conduct the experiments in the lab of
Ruth Hufbauer at Colorado State University ( http://-
lamar.colostate.edu/ ˜ hufbauer/ ). We will collaborate
closely with mathematical biologists at CU Boulder in
Brett Melbourne’s lab (ttp:// www.colorado.edu/eeb/-
facultysites/melbourne/ ).
Previous experience conducting lab experiments using
insects or other model organisms would be helpful, and
a strong background in evolutionary ecology is vital.
The ability to start as early as January 2011 would be
a bonus, but at the latest summer 2011.October 1, 2010 EvolDir 15
Please get in touch with Ruth for additional de-
tails. When you write, please send a CV that in-
cludes information on coursework and grades. Ap-
plications can either go through BSPM ( http://-

CRI-FEM Evolutionary Genetics
Conifers
PhD opportunity on “Evolution of regulatory elements
of adaptive genes in Conifers” Project code: PJ10 AM
03
Contact person: VAROTTO CLAUDIO, PhD clau-
dio.varotto@iasma.it
Institutions: Edmund Mach Foundation - Environment
Department (IT), University of California at Davis -
Department of Plant Sciences (USA)
The project is a collaboration between the group of Dr.
Claudio Varotto at the Research and Innovation Cen-
tre (CRI) of the Edmund Mach Foundation ( http://-
www.iasma.it/ ), and the group of Prof. David Neale
(http://dendrome.ucdavis.edu/NealeLab/ ). The suc-
cessful candidate will carry out the project mainly at
CRI-FEM with a stage of at least 6 months at at the
University of Davis, California (USA).
We oﬀer a competitive scolarship, subsidized meal ben-
eﬁts, a foreign oﬃce providing support for accomoda-
tion search and bureaucratic aspects. We aim to help
our candidates to develop their creative abilities of stu-
dents to carry out original scientiﬁc research. The
training environment of CRI oﬀers an integrated ap-
proach on problems related to the domain of natural
resources, biodiversity, genomics as well as food pro-
duction, health, and biotechonologies.
The Institute is located in the wonderful setting of the
Eastern Italian Alps, a few Km north of Trento, a
renowned location for both summer and winter holy-days (hiking, climbing, biking, skiing).
PROJECT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION The aims of
this project are: 1) the identiﬁcation of regulatory ele-
ments (REs) in the promoters of genes involved in adap-
tive responses in conifers; 2) the analysis of patterns of
REs nucleotide variation in conifers; 3) the assessment
of the adaptive potential of polymorphisms aﬀecting the
REs identiﬁed in natural populations of selected conifer
species.
Conifers are extremely important tree species, both
from an ecological and an economical point of view.
Several candidate genes for stress adaptation have re-
cently been identiﬁed in conifers or characterized in
model species. While most of the studies currently fo-
cus on the identiﬁcation of signals of selective pressure
acting on the coding sequences, little is known about
regulatory regions.
We are looking for a highly motivated and dynamic can-
didate to carry out a PhD project aimed at the identiﬁ-
cation of regulatory elements (REs) in the promoters of
genes involved in adaptive responses in conifers. Nat-
ural genetic variation aﬀecting the REs identiﬁed will
be assessed in natural populations of selected conifer
species and associated to adaptive diﬀerences among
them. Population genetics studies will then provide
the framework for the statistical identiﬁcation of nat-
urally occurring regulatory variation in adaptive genes
in selected conifer species.
FELLOWSHIP DESCRIPTION FEM - Research and
Innovation Centre welcomes applications for a 3-year

Dalhousie MicrobeDiversity
The Doolittle, Bielawski and Beiko labs at Dalhousie
University, in collaboration with Olga Zhaxybayeva
(West Virginia) and Marc Ereshefsky (Calgary) are
looking for several PhD students and postdocs to join
the project “Modeling and mapping microbial diver-
sity and function with marker genes, genomes and
metagenomes”, recently funded by the Canadian In-
stitutes of Health Research as part of the Canadian
Microbiome Initiative. The main aim of this project
is to understand human-associated microbial commu-
nities not only in terms of who is there, but also in
terms of what key genetic and metabolic processes are
characteristic of diﬀerent clinical scenarios. This purely
bioinformatic project involves the analysis of large ge-
nomic and metagenomic datasets from public reposito-
ries and from several collaborating research groups.
Key elements of the project include
(i) Analysis of publicly available microbial genomic and
metagenomic datasets to delineate appropriate units
of diversity. To what extent is it useful to consider
microbial species and speciation as key determinants
of a microbiome? (ii) Uncovering the determinantsof phenotype for microbes and microbial communi-
ties. What important genes, metabolic and evolution-
ary processes (particularly neutral evolution, adapta-
tion, recombination, and lateral gene transfer) are char-
acteristic of complex individual and community pheno-
types (pathogen vs. commensal, healthy vs. diseased)?
(iii) Development and deployment of software. We will
build a modular suite of software tools that incorpo-
rates insights gained from (i) and (ii), and from other
sources. The main software framework and graphical
interface will be implemented in Python, but manage-
ment and analysis of large data sets will require certain
modules to be written in C/C++.
Individuals with backgrounds in population genetics,
microbial genomics, molecular evolution, phylogenet-
ics, bioinformatics, computer science, mathematics or
statistics are encouraged to apply. Applications will
be considered on an ongoing basis, with positions be-
ginning immediately. Successful applicants will join a
thriving multidisciplinary team that is already devel-
oping and applying bioinformatics software (see http:/-
/kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software for examples), and will have
access to several high-performance computing clusters
as well as conference travel opportunities, and be ac-
tive participants in Dalhousie’s Centre for Comparative
Genomics and Evolutionary Bioinformatics ( http://-
cgeb.dal.ca/ ).
Interested and qualiﬁed applicants should send a cur-
riculum vitae and a one-page statement of interest to

Duke University Deep-Sea Population Genetics We seek
at least two exceptional graduate students interested
in population genetics and connectivity to join us at
Duke in an NSF- recommended study of deep-sea in-
vertebrates from chemosynthetic environments. Our
study sites include seeps in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mex-
ico, and Atlantic seaboard and 7 research cruises, at
least one of which will use the deep-diving research
submersible Alvin. Our team includes oceanographers
and modelers at NC State (Roy He and Dave Eggle-
ston) and larval biologists at the University of Oregon
(Craig Young and Svetlana Maskalova). Together, this
team will integrate biophysical and genetic data in a
seascape approach to understanding connectivity. WeOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 17
are looking for students who already have some research
exposure to genetics, have great hands in the lab, will
embrace the at-sea experience, have experience in sci-
entiﬁc writing, and (ideally) have started programming
in “R”. Students accepted to Duke’s PhD programs are
guaranteed full support for 5 academic years through a
combination of fellowships, teaching assistantships and
research assistantships. In addition, we oﬀer 4 years
of summer support for each student and a dive to the
seaﬂoor in Alvin.
US students are encouraged to apply for a prestigious
NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for work at Duke.
The website is: http:// www.nsfgrfp.org/ . Deadline for
life sciences is 22 November.
Exceptional international students are encouraged to
apply for Fulbright and national fellowships for study
in the US.
Because Cliﬀ and I are in diﬀerent parts of Duke, an ef-
fective strategy for admission is for potential applicants
to consider submitting to the Duke Graduate School
through the Biology Department, through the Division
of Marine Science and Conservation, and through the
University Program in Genetics and Genomics. My un-
derstanding is that this strategy will improve chances of
acceptance and of a fellowship for qualiﬁed applicants.

Two PhD Positions in Experimental Microbial Ecology
The Molecular Microbial Ecology Group at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology-Z¨ urich (ETH-Z) and
the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and
Technology (Eawag) has two PhD positions available
in experimental microbial ecology. Both positions
seek to understand the evolution and implications of
cross-feeding, whereby one microorganism consumes
metabolic intermediates produced by another microor-
ganism. The objectives of the project are to better
understand why cross-feeding sometimes occurs within
microbial communities and how cross-feeding can pro-
mote diversity within these communities. Denitriﬁca-
tion of nitrate to nitrogen gas is used as a model cross-
feeding pathway, which has important implications for
water quality, air quality, and global warming. The po-
sitions are expected to largely focus on experimental
work, but may incorporate theoretical components as
well. Both positions will begin January 1st, 2011, but
this is to some degree negotiable. The positions are
funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation for
three years, include an annual salary of approximately
57,000 CHF, and cover all tuition costs.
The Molecular Microbial Ecology Group provides a
unique opportunity to conduct research in microbial
ecology. The group is located at Eawag, which has
a broad range of expertise in environmental sciences,
including ecology, microbiology, chemistry, and toxicol-
ogy. The group is also part of the Department of En-
vironmental Sciences at ETH-Z and maintains strong
interactions with various groups in experimental and
theoretical biology. Both Eawag and ETH-Z are lo-
cated within the Z¨ urich metropolitan area. The city of
Z¨ urich is continuously ranked among the top cities in
the world for quality of life and is within close proximity
to the Swiss Alps.
Interested applicants should have a Masters degree or
equivalent in biological or environmental sciences and
have a strong background in experimental microbiol-
ogy, microbial ecology, and / or microbial evolution.
The ability to conduct research independently and to
communicate in English is essential. Those interested
should send (as PDFs) a cover letter outlining their mo-
tivation to work on the project, a CV, a brief summary
of research experiences and interests, and contact in-18 EvolDir October 1, 2010

PHD AND POSTDOC POSITIONS IN POPULA-
TION BIOLOGY AND GENETICS OF INFECTIOUS
DISEASES AT THE ETH ZURICH
Positions for two PhD student, a junior and a senior
postdoc are available in the groups of Sebastian Bon-
hoeﬀer and Roland Regoes at the ETH Zurich. In our
groups we study the population biology and genetics
of infectious diseases. For more information on our
groups see www.tb.ethz.ch . One of the PhD students
and the senior postdoc would work in the group of Se-
bastian Bonhoeﬀer. The broad research area of these
two positions will be the theoretical population genet-
ics of infectious disease (see www.tb.ethz.ch/research/-
Bonhoeﬀer ). Applicants for the PhD position should
have strong quantitative skills. We therefore encourage
people with a background in mathematics, biostatistics,
bioinformatics or physics to apply. For applicants for
the senior postdoc position a track-record in studying
the emergence and the control of drug-resistance is an
advantage. The postdoc position comes with a high
degree of independence, and it would be great if you
developed your own projects, possibly also involving
the more junior members of the group. A strong back-
ground in mathematical modelling and computation is
required for this position.
The other PhD student and the junior postdoc would
work with Roland Regoes, studying the population bi-
ology of immune responses against viruses. In the
last years Roland Regoes and his group members stud-
ied the dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing in
vivo, and the neutralization of HIV by antibodies (see
www.tb.ethz.ch/research/Regoes ), and the PhD stu-
dent and the postdoc could work on some of these top-ics initially. While our research is conducted in close
collaboration with experimental immunology and virol-
ogy laboratories (eg Annette Oxenius and Alexandra
Trkola), we are seeking candidates with strong quanti-
tative skills (for example, trained mathematicians, bio-
statisticians, or physicists).
The starting dates of these positions are fairly ﬂexible.
We envisage some time at the end of this year.
Our groups are strongly linked with the experimental
ecology group of Paul Schmid-Hempel, and the micro-
bial evolution group of Martin Ackermann at the In-
stitute of Integrative Biology of the ETH Zurich (see
http://www.ibz.ethz.ch/ for more details).
Zurich is a great place to live and to do research. It
is the home of two big universties (the University of
Zurich and the ETH), and is an attractive city in beau-
tiful surroundings with a multinational population and
many educational and recreational opportunities.
To apply send a letter describing your interest in
this position, a CV and the names and contact ad-
dresses of two referees by email to our secretary Rita
Jenny: rita.jenny@env.ethz.ch. Please write “Applica-
tion for postdoc/PhD position with Sebastian Bonhoef-
fer/Roland Regoes” into the subject line of your email.
The deadline of the application is October 31, 2010.
Informal enquires to roland.regoes@env.ethz.ch or se-
bastian.bonhoeﬀer@env.ethz.ch are also welcome.

A PhD position is available at ETH Zurich under the
supervision of Dr. Jan Engelst¨ adter. The aim of the
project is to develop mathematical models for the evo-
lution of genetic exchange in bacteria, with the over-
arching goal of gaining a better understanding of why
sex and recombination are so abundant in nature. An
important applied aspect in this project concerns the
evolution of resistance to antibacterial compounds in
pathogens, which is a major problem in public health.
Starting date of the position is January 1st 2011, but
this is to some degree negotiable. The position is funded
by the Swiss National Science Foundation for threeOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 19
years.
The successful applicant will be based at the main cam-
pus of the ETH Zurich close to the town center. She
or he will belong to both the Molecular Microbial Ecol-
ogy group, led by Prof. Martin Ackermann, and to
the Theoretical Biology Group, led by Prof. Sebas-
tian Bonhoeﬀer. This environment provides ample op-
portunities for collaborations with other theoreticians
as well as experimental biologists. The groups are
very international and the working language is English.
(Some knowledge of German may be helpful for living in
Zurich but is not necessary.) Zurich is a beautiful city
that oﬀers many cultural and outdoor activities and a
high general quality of life.
Applicants should have a keen interest in evolutionary
questions and be highly motivated to address such ques-
tions with mathematical models. A strong background
in either evolutionary biology (including population bi-
ology and genetics) or mathematics is essential, as is
the ability to conduct research independently and to
communicate proﬁciently in English. Knowledge of a
programming language (e.g., C/C++ or R) is desir-
able, but not necessary. A Master degree in biology,
mathematics, physics or a related ﬁeld is required for
the position.
Applicants should send (as PDFs) a cover letter out-
lining their motivation to work on this project, a CV,
a brief summary of research experiences and interests,
and contact information of at least two academic ref-
erees to jan.engelstaedter@env.ethz.ch. Reviewing of
applications will start on October 18th. Informal in-

IguanaPopulationGenetics
The Welch Lab at Mississippi State University is look-
ing for graduate students to work on the population
genetics of Caribbean rock iguanas. We are interested
in recruiting both MS and PhD students that would
like to pursue a degree in Biological Sciences. Students
will also be able to choose between applied conserva-
tion genetics research projects as well as more basic
research projects focused on the evolutionary dynamics
of natural populations. Island populations of iguanas
are particularly useful for these types of studies because
gene ﬂow between islands is typically low, and popula-
tion sizes vary providing natural replicates for study.
This research is facilitated by extensive collaboration
with leading conservation biologists in the ﬁeld. Par-
ticipants in the Welch lab will primarily be asked to
conduct molecular genetic analyses. However,ﬁeldwork
is highly encouraged. Three students working on one
project have already conducted extensive work in the
Turks and Caicos Islands. Funding for students will ini-
tially be provided by means of teaching assistantships
with the potential for research assistantships dependent
on the availability of external funding. We are looking
for students to start at any point in 2011.Please con-
tact Mark Welch at welchATbiologyDOTmsstateDOT-

*PhD position in Ecology/Evolution* **Coevolution in
tritrophic systems** **
At the Department of Botany, Stockholm University,
ref. no. 2/2010Coevolution underlies the diversity of life, and is there-
fore an essential process in evolutionary research. In
food webs, evolution may be aﬀected by several species
and the understanding of underlying processes necessi-
tates a multifacetted approach. This project aims to
explore coevolution in tritrophic food webs associated
with the plant purple loosestrife (/Lythrum salicaria/).
The project will explore the complexity of coevolution-
ary processes through a collaboration between plant
ecology, insect ecology, insect immunology and chem-
ical ecology. This collaboration is needed to provide a
more complete picture on the ecological and evolution-
ary eﬀects of species interactions. As a PhD-student in
this project, you will therefore get a broad experience
on modern coevolutionary research.

UBasel Biogeography
PhD Position in Biogeography 2010, Basel, Switzerland
Project title: Life history and Biogeography: a com-
parative evolutionary study of the Terrestrialisation of
African amphibians September 7, 2010
PhD-POSITION IN Biogeography. We are looking for
a highly motivated graduate student interested in bio-
geography. The research of our group is focussed on
diversiﬁcation patterns - and the processes that gov-
ern them. The research in our group has focused pri-
marily on the phylogenetic diversiﬁcation of amphib-
ians (our model group), and mainly on the continent
of Africa (our model area). The research is charac-
terized by the integration of a broad range of tech-
niques - ﬁeldwork, taxonomy, molecular and morpho-
logical systematics, traditional descriptive and modern
biogeographic approaches - used to interpret patterns of
diversity in Africa, particularly in rainforest habitats.
The SNF funded project seeks to address fundamen-
tal questions on how life history strategies in African
amphibians have developed over time and space. We
address this question by looking at the biogeographi-
cal correlates that might explain the evolution of the
diversity of developmental terrestrialization in African
amphibians. This will be investigated through state
of the art methods and novel approaches that combine
ecological and evolutionary approaches. We will look
for signiﬁcant correlations between life history strategy
traits and environmental parameters (e.g. climate and
habitat). Complementing this we will conduct phyloge-
netic analyses to reconstruct evolutionary trees (time-
trees). Understanding the overall patterns by which
life histories have changed through evolutionary time
will elucidate potential mechanisms of how, and un-
der what circumstances key innovations, such as terres-
trialization, have developed spatially and temporally.
BACKGROUND. Applicants should have a MSc de-
gree (or equivalent) in a relevant ﬁeld, and a strong
background and keen interest in systematics. Previous
experience in molecular systematics is necessary, and
an interest in learning GIS and climatic niche mod-
elling techniques would be important. RESEARCHOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 23

UEdinburgh PopulationQuantitative
Ph.D. Studentship at The Roslin Institute (University
of Edinburgh)
We are currently recruiting a Ph.D. student (ONLY
UK RESIDENTS) to evaluate and apply novel statisti-
cal techniques for diversity-based gene mapping. This
four-year studentship is funded by a Genesis Faraday
CASE BBSRC award with an enhanced stipend and
other beneﬁts provided by Genesis Faraday and the
CASE partner, Aviagen Ltd.
The rationale for this gene-mapping approach is that
variation will be reduced in regions of the genome sub-
ject to positive selection. Patterns of genome-wide di-
versity may reveal regions that have been under strong
selection and contain genes with large phenotypic ef-
fects. This project will focus on the development, eval-
uation and application of methods of testing for selec-
tion using both simulated and genomic poultry data.
This studentship will thus provide training in popula-
tion and quantitative genetics, statistical methods, sci-
entiﬁc computing and bioinformatics.
The student will be based at The Roslin Institute and
the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IEB) at the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh. The Edinburgh genetics research
community is thriving, with strong expertise in pop-
ulation and quantitative genetics, making it an excit-
ing place to study. The student will also spend time
at Aviagen Ltd (Edinburgh), one of the major poul-
try breeders in the world with a strong commitment to
research.24 EvolDir October 1, 2010
We are seeking an enthusiastic individual with an in-
terest in population and evolutionary biology or animal
genetics and aptitude with computer-based numerical
analyses. The UK-based candidate should possess a
good quality ﬁrst degree in a relevant subject. En-
thusiasm, dedication and aptitude are the most impor-
tant characteristics; additional training in genetics and
genome analysis are available at IEB.
The project involves a collaboration between Pam
Wiener (Roslin), Chris Haley (MRC Human Genet-
ics Unit), Brian Charlesworth (IEB) and Kellie Wat-
son (Aviagen). Applications including a full CV with
names and addresses (including email addresses) of two
academic referees, should be sent to:

that diet can directly inﬂuence jaw morphology in some
African cichlids, however the epigenetic mechanism by
which this occurs remains uncharacterized. The project
combines animal physiology with a range of modern
molecular biology techniques to test the theory that
strain-mediated remodeling plays a fundamental role
in the observed phenotypic plasticity. This PhD stu-
dent position is a part of a newly funded DFG-project
in our laboratory, and will provide a Ph.D. salary forthree years. The candidate should have experience in
one or more of the following techniques: cloning, mi-
croarray, QRT-PCR or in situ hybridization.
This project is being conducted within the laboratory of
Prof. Axel Meyer, which combines both world-class ﬁsh
breeding and molecular laboratory facilities. The Ph.D.
student will have the opportunity to join the newly
formed International Max Planck Research School in

UOtago NZ Genetics Cryptic
Female Choice
Ph.D. Project Opportunity Available to Investigate the
Genetic basis of Cryptic Female Choice in Chinook
Salmon
We are currently seeking a student with interests in
genetics, evolution, and/or behavioural ecology to con-
duct research into the genetic basis of possible cryptic
female choice in Chinook salmon.
Project Description In many species females can con-
trol fertilisation after mating via behavioural, morpho-
logical, and physiological mechanisms - a process called
cryptic female choice (CFC). While widespread, it is
generally unknown, if and how CFC might be exerted
in external fertilisers, where eggs and sperm are shed
simultaneously into the surrounding water. We demon-
strated in salmon that ovarian ﬂuid, a viscous substance
released with eggs during spawning, diﬀerentially alters
male sperm function in a female-dependent fashion, and
thus that females may exert cryptic control of male re-
productive success (Rosengrave et al.2008. A mecha-
nism for cryptic female choice in chinook salmon. Be-
havioral Ecology 19: 1179-85). The rationale for this
CFC is unknown, but our hypothesis is that ovarian-
ﬂuid-mediates sperm selection promoting favoured ge-
netic combinations that enhance oﬀspring ﬁtness. We
will test this hypothesis using a novel combination of
computer assisted sperm analysis, compositional anal-
yses, replicated paired-male competitive in vitro fertil-
isation experiments that mimic the gametic microen-
vironment, and genetic screens of MHC class I, class
II and microsatellite loci to establish parentage. Us-
ing these approaches we will determine (i) the eﬀects of
a given female’s ovarian ﬂuid on a male’s sperm func-tion, (ii) how this male x female interaction inﬂuences
male reproductive success, (iii) whether particular male
and female genotype combinations (MHC I, II and mi-
crosatellites) are associated with greater or lesser sperm
performance and male reproductive success, and (iv)
whether any compositional diﬀerences among gametic
ﬂuids explain the patterns we observe. Our expectation
is that the successful PhD student will focus on tasks
ii), and iii), while contributing to the others.
The Ideal Candidate The ideal candidate will possess
experience in molecular genetics, evolutionary genetics
and behavioural ecology. They will be motivated and
organised, with a demonstrated capacity to master the
broad skill set necessary for the successful completion of
a research programme. They will be a competent labo-
ratory worker, with experience of all routine molecular
genetic techniques, particularly microsatellite genotyp-
ing and sequencing, and should be computer literate
with familiarity with database management and statis-
tical analyses. Minimum qualiﬁcations: B.Sc. (Hons)
and/or M.Sc. in Genetics, Molecular Biology, Molecu-
lar Ecology or equivalent with and A- average or better.

Riccardo Papa: I am a new Faculty member starting
a lab at the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras.
Since I was an undergraduate student, I was attracted
by the incredible diversity of shape and color of each
living organism. With my research, I try to understand
the origin and evolution of natural diversity. My re-
search interests focus on the interaction between the en-
vironment and its living organisms, with particular em-
phasis on understanding how new phenotypes arise and
evolve in association with the surrounding ecosystem.
My work explores phenotypic plasticity as a source of
variation for natural selection and adaptation to work
upon. To investigate what governs pattern diversity,
what limits it, and what promotes its potentials, I com-
bine methods of pure genetics, phylogenetics, develop-
mental cell biology, and functional genomics. I am es-
pecially interested in butterﬂy wings patterns, because
I am attracted to the possibility of combining popu-
lation biology (natural selection and adaptation), with
genetics and developmental biology.
I am seeking a Ph.D. student interested in working on
an interdisciplinary project in the area of evolution-
ary biology. Speciﬁc project can be discussed with the
applicant. The candidate should have a strong back-
ground in molecular and evolutionary biology and be
highly motivated. Ability to work in a team is essential.
The project is expected to be very demanding but re-
warding and asks for an independent and creative mind.
The candidate should have a strong interest in experi-
mental molecular work on insects and a good working
knowledge of bioinformatics. Proﬁciency of the English
language is required. The study will involve ﬁeld and28 EvolDir October 1, 2010
laboratory work and will present the possibility to carry
out part of the study at UC Irvine (California) or at the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. A
stipend for at least the ﬁrst two years is guaranteed, but
the applicant has to meet the following requirement:s
a) Hispanic origin, b) USA resident.
Additional information: My work is in collaboration
with an extended group of colleagues that creates a vi-
brant and enjoyable scientiﬁc community. My lab is
located at the University of Puerto Rico- Rio Piedras

USheﬃeld BehaviouralEvolution
Ph-D position in Behavioural Ecology of House Spar-
rows - Univ. Sheﬃeld, UK
The PhD student will work in a team on our house
sparrow population on Lundy Island - on “personality
and ﬁtness consequences”.
Requirements: We are a seeking motivated and inde-
pendent team player to join our house sparrow research
group. The ﬁeldwork on Lundy Island will conducted
for 4 months per year, requiring a committed and col-
laborative individual. Ideally, you have previous re-
search experience, ﬁeldwork experience, and are inter-
ested in birds and behavioural ecology. Experience in
handling birds and/or a ringing licence are an advan-
tage. The graduate position is for 3 years, with a ﬂexi-
ble starting date before January 2011. The supervisors
are Prof. Terry Burke, Dr. Julia Schroeder (Sheﬃeld
University) and Dr. Shinichi Nakagawa (Otago Uni-
versity, NZ). For any questions and to apply, contact
julia.schroeder@sheﬃeld.ac.uk.
This is a re-advertisement and if you applied before you
do not need to apply again.
Project description: In behavioural and evolutionary
biology, there has been a recent explosive interest in
the phenomenon known as behavioural syndromes (i.e.,
animal personality or consistent behavioural diﬀerences
between individuals across diverse contexts). A re-
alisation of the ubiquity of behavioural syndromes in
the wild has shaken the traditional view of animal be-
haviour in which behavioural phenotypes are expected
to be inﬁnitely ﬂexible so as to be adaptive in any given
context. Despite much interest in animal personality re-
search, very little is yet known about how diﬀerent per-
sonalities can aﬀect the ﬁtness of animals. We will use
a long-term monitored population of house sparrows
on Lundy Island to investigate the link between ﬁtness
and personality in the wild. There are ﬁve personality
traits recognised: activity, boldness, exploration, ag-October 1, 2010 EvolDir 29
gressiveness and sociability. We will particularly fo-
cus on the ﬁrst three personality traits. Our previous
studies have demonstrated that two behavioural traits,
parental care and ﬁdelity (quantiﬁed by extra-pair mat-
ing), are repeatable within individuals, meaning, for ex-
ample, that some individuals express consistently high
parental care or that others are successful at gaining
extra-pair paternity through their lifetime. Obviously
these two traits have signiﬁcant ﬁtness consequences.
A critical feature of this study is that al individuals are
monitored through time and DNA proﬁling will be used
to conﬁrm the pedigree. Consequently, it will be possi-
ble to attach precise ﬁtness measures to alternative be-
haviours. The project will therefore be among the ﬁrst
to investigate intricate interactions among these ﬁtness-
related behavioural traits (parental care and mate ﬁ-
delity) and personality traits (e.g., activity, boldness
and exploration).

UZurich Phylogenetics
Integrative phylogenetic/niche modeling Ph.D. position
at the University of Zurich
Project description: The selected Ph.D. student will
participate in a broad collaborative project entitled
ˆ aEﬀects of climate change on past, recent, and fu-
ture biodiversity of alpine/arctic plants: Integrative ev-
idence from phylogenies, population genetics, ecologi-
cal niche modeling and new insights for conservationˆ a,
funded by a ProDoc grant from the Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation (SNF) within the Z¨ urich-Basel Plant
Science Center (PSC).
Recent improvements in our ability to reconstruct the
history of biodiversity through timed phylogenies, es-
timate changes in genetic diversity, and predict the
potential distribution of selected species with ecolog-
ical niche models (ENMs) now allow us to infer the
evolution of ecological preferences and distributional
ranges at diﬀerent temporal scales, from the present,
to the past and the future. The Ph.D. student based
at the University of Z¨ urich will use a combination of
phylogeny and ENM to test (i) the model of allopoly-
ploid speciation by secondary contact in arctic/alpine
plants; (ii) whether island colonization by plants with
specialized breeding systems is associated with a change
of reproductive strategy, ecological preferences, and ge-
netic variation. The biological model system used to
address these questions is Primula section Aleuritia, be-
cause it includes a range of ploidy levels and phylogeny-
based hypotheses of polyploid species origins are avail-
able (see Guggisberg A., Mansion G., & Conti E. 2009.
Disentangling reticulate evolution in an arctic-alpine
polyploid complex. Systematic Biology 58:55-73). The
project stems from a direct collaboration between Elena
Conti (phylogeny-biogeography; University of Zurich)30 EvolDir October 1, 2010
and Christoph Randin (ecological niche modeling; Uni-
versity of Basel), with additional expertise provided by
Stephen Smith (National Evolutionary Synthesis Cen-
ter, USA) and J ˜Ac/circlecopyrtr˜Ame Goudet (University of Lau-
sanne). Position characteristics: We oﬀer a highly co-
operative and stimulating working environment in mo-
tivated teams, interdisciplinary collaboration with lead-
ing research institutions, and opportunities for publica-
tion in highˆ aranking scientiﬁc journals. Salary accord-
ing to the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)
guidelines. Funding is available for 3 years. Require-
ments: Applicants must hold a master degree in biology
or related disciplines. Practical experience in molecular
techniques and phylogenetic analysis (or phylogeogra-
phy/population genetics) highly desirable. Excellent
knowledge of the English language, written and oral,
required. High motivation, ability to work in an inter-
disciplinary team and social competence are expected.

LOCATION: Department of Entomology, The Ohio
State University, Ohio Agricultural Research and De-
velopment Center (OARDC), Wooster, Ohio ( http://-
entomology.osu.edu/, http://oardc.ohio-state.edu).
QUALIFICATIONS: Ph.D. in Entomology, Zoology, or
related ﬁeld with focus on biology, genetics, and ecology
of honey bees or other insect pollinators, including but
not limited to, functional genomics, metabolomics, neu-
rophysiology, behavior, pathology, or toxicology. Ex-
perience with pollinating insects is required, and ap-
plicants with prior experience relevant to honey bees
will be strongly considered. Other qualiﬁcations in-
clude excellent oral and written communication skills,
evidence of scholarly research and productivity, demon-
strated potential for quality teaching, and willingnessto collaborate. Desired qualiﬁcations include teaching
and post-doctoral experience, and experience with ex-
tramural funding opportunities.
POSITION DESCRIPTION: Assistant Professor, 9-
month tenure-track appointment focusing on honey
bees and/or other pollinating insects, 80% research /
20% teaching.
For four decades, the Department of Entomology at
The Ohio State University led research in honey bee
genetics. At the forefront of these eﬀorts was Dr. Wal-
ter Rothenbuhler, the preeminent honey bee geneti-
cist in the country who made signiﬁcant contributions
to our understanding of honey bee biology and their
importance to modern agriculture. Currently, 30% of
Ohio crops depend on bees and other insects for polli-
nation. The Department of Entomology at The Ohio
State University wishes to reclaim the Rothenbuhler
legacy and regain our ability to perform world-class
research on pollinators. With the sequencing of the
honey bee genome, we believe that molecular biology
will make important contributions to understanding
honey bee physiology and ecology, including their inter-
actions with the pesticides, pathogens, and arthropod
pests that impact the health of hives. Current meth-
ods in physiology, proteomics, metabolomics and struc-
tural and functional genomics-including recent second-
generation sequencing technologies-hold great promise
for signiﬁcant advances in biology and ecology of the
insects that provide critical pollination services to sup-
port agricultural production. This position is central to
addressing these vital issues and to fulﬁll the OARDC’s
mission to enhance the well-being of the people of Ohio,
the nation and world through research on food, agricul-
ture, family and environment.
Research (80%): The successful applicant is expected to
develop an internationally renowned research program
focused on insect pollinators relevant to food produc-
tion. Research areas include but are not limited to:
- molecular biology and functional genomics; - neuro-
physiology, learning, and behavior; - health of honey
bee and other pollinators including interactions with
pathogens, arthropod pests and pesticides; - ecology
of honey bees and other pollinator populations in agri-
cultural and urban ecosystems; - pollinator services to
economically important plants.
Teaching (20%): The successful applicant will con-
tribute to innovative undergraduate and graduate level
curricula in entomology and related disciplines. Addi-
tional responsibilities include graduate seminar courses
and the advising of graduate students.
OARDC/OSU COLLABORATION: We encourage
close collaborations with existing teaching, extension,October 1, 2010 EvolDir 47
and research programs within the Department of En-
tomology including a world-class extension program in
apiculture, research programs in functional genomics,
population genetics, physiology, behavior, chemical
ecology, plant-insect interactions, biological control,
modeling, landscape ecology, and ecosystem manage-
ment. Strong candidates would show interest and abili-
ties in building intra-departmental expertise on projects
to scale understanding of insect biology from genes to
ecosystems. Opportunities also exist for collaboration
with departments across the OSU campuses including
Horticulture and Crop Science, Plant Pathology, and
Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology, as well
as interdisciplinary programs in Molecular, Cellular, &
Developmental Biology, Agroecosystem Management,
Organic Food and Farm Educational Research, and Ur-
ban Landscape Ecology. There exists potential to inter-
act with the highly active Wooster Area Molecular Bi-
ology Association (WAMBA) that builds partnerships
among departments on the OARDC campus and inter-
institutional collaborations with molecular biologists at
the College of Wooster.
FACILITY SUPPORT: The successful applicant will
have access to existing bee hives and apiculture facili-
ties, as well as ample greenhouse space and land

Dear colleagues,
the University of Paris South (Orsay, France) invites
applications for a tenured academic position (Assistant
Professor) in Biological Conservation/Population Dy-
namics, with a research focus on invasion biology in a
context of climate change.
The drawbacks of such French positions, is that the
teaching load is quite heavy (192h/year). Hence the
importance of having a group backing you up when
you are A. Prof., which will be the case here. There is
also a need to at least show you are willing to be able
to teach most of your classes in French in the coming
years. Otherwise, we work in English in the lab.
The good sides, beside working with a great groupin a great lab on a great campus, obviously, is that
these positions are tenured, with ample liberty on re-
search themes. And croissants for every breakfast for
life... Deadline for administrative applications is Octo-
ber 28th, deadline for scientiﬁc application is December
17th.

SouthAmerica FieldAssist
Field assistant to study a cooperative breeding system
in South America
We are looking for a highly motivated ﬁeld assistant
to join us working on the breeding system of the en-
dangered El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi). The ap-
parently cooperative breeding system is studied for the
ﬁrst time in this species. Until now cooperative be-
haviour has been seldom observed in parakeets and
our work focuses on the factors underlying the de-
velopment of delayed dispersal and cooperative breed-
ing. More details about the project can be looked up
at:www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/data/bio1/schaefer/-
Fieldwork will take place at Buenaventura reserve
(www.fjocotoco.org ) near Pinas, southwest Ecuador.
Fieldwork includes capturing birds with mist nets and
inside artiﬁcial nest boxes, taking morphometric mea-
surements and blood samples, banding of birds and ﬁeld
observation of parakeet ﬂocks. The parakeet ﬂocks are
distributed throughout the whole reserve and adjacentareas, therefore long and exhausting daily treks across
the foothills of the Andes are unavoidable. Fieldwork
will be done during rainy season. Moreover, batteries
(~3kg) for nest cameras have to be changed every two
days. The project will cover the costs for ﬂight and
accommodation at the reserve. If required, a letter of
recommendation will be draw up. The position is avail-
able from January until April 2011.

chewing herbivore of the reference plant Arabidopsis
thaliana. This herbivore is a Drosophila species that
mines the leaves of this plant and so we seek to leverage
genomic tools to study the plant-insect interaction from
both sides of the host and parasite equation. Finally,
we are developing a co-evolutionary genomics model for
studying plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions in the
ﬁeld and greenhouse.

UGothenburg EvolutionaryEcol
LECTURESHIP, the ﬁeld of animal terrestrial evolu-
tionary ecology
Senior Lecturer in Animal Ecology
at the Department of Zoology, Univ of Gothenburg
(G¨ oteborg), Sweden
Research in Animal Ecology at the Department deals
with basic ecological and evolutionary questions as well
as applied ecology, including biodiversity and environ-
mental aspects in terrestrial and aquatic environments.
We combine ecological theory and modelling with ﬁeld
observations and experiments to generate and address
hypotheses where the focus is to understand the ecol-
ogy of animals as a result of natural selection and other
evolutionary pro-cesses. This approach increases the
understanding of animal populations and communities,
and provides background knowledge for biodiversity-
and other applied work. The open position should be
integrated with, and enhance, the development of this
successful activity at the Department.
Responsibilities The successful candidate is expected to
conduct research, supervise Ph.D. students and actively
apply for external research funding within the ﬁeld of
animal terrestrial evolutionary ecology. Other impor-
tant responsibilities are to support and develop our re-
search and teaching activities in molecular ecology and
conservation ecology. Further, the successful candidate
is expected to plan, teach, lead and develop courses at
the basic and advanced levels, especially in animal evo-
lutionary ecology. The position as Senior Lecturer may
also include various leadership- and/or administrative
responsibilities.
Qualiﬁcation requirements A Ph.D. in animal ecology
or related subjects is required. The qualiﬁcations re-quirements as stated in the Higher Education Ordi-
nance are applied for the position. The position also
requires an ability to teach in Swedish and English.
The successful applicant is expected to be able to teach
in Swedish within two years.
Assessment grounds Scientiﬁc and pedagogical proﬁ-
ciency are considered to be equally important for the
assessment of the applicants. When assessing scientiﬁc
proﬁciency, special weight is given to documented com-
petence in the ﬁeld of animal terrestrial evolutionary
ecology with high-quality publications in internation-
ally renowned journals. A background in evolutionary
ecology, molecular ecology and conservation biology is
meriting, as is experience of leading research groups.
When assessing pedagogical proﬁciency weight is given
to successful supervision of Ph.D. students, and doc-
umented experience of teaching in animal ecology and
related subjects. Experience of course leadership, de-
velopment and organization is meriting, including doc-
umented experience of teaching administration. After

University Lecturer in Evolutionary Biology
Department of Zoology
University of Oxford
The Department of Zoology proposes to appoint a Uni-
versity Lecturer in the broad area of Evolutionary Bi-
ology with eﬀect from 1 January 2011 or as soon as
possible thereafter. The post is associated with a Tu-
torial Fellowship at Magdalen College, under arrange-
ments described in the further particulars. The com-
bined University and College salary will be on a scale
up to £57,201 per annum, and an additional College
housing allowance of £10,250 per annum is available if
the successful candidate chooses not to reside in Col-
lege. Other allowances are detailed in the further par-
ticulars.
Preference will be given to applicants with a strong
background in Evolutionary Biology. The successful
candidate will be expected to lead a research pro-
gramme and research group in Evolutionary Biology,
to give undergraduate lectures and tutorials, to super-
vise graduate students and to carry out examining and
administrative duties in the Department and the Col-
lege.//
Further particulars, containing details of the applica-
tion procedure and of the duties, may be obtained
from paul.harvey@zoo.ox.ac.uk or by visiting http://-
www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/jobs . The closing date for applica-
tions is noon on 25 October 2010.Applications are particularly welcome from women and
black and minority ethnic candidates, who are under-
represented in academic posts in Oxford.
The University is committed to equality and valuing
diversity. Detailed information about the Department
of Zoology may be found at http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/ .
The Department of Zoology is the country’s foremost
Department researching whole organism biology from
an evolutionary perspective. Research focuses on as-
pects of behaviour, development, disease, ecology and
evolution, though most members of the Department
work at the interface of two or more of those top-
ics. The Department incorporates three research In-
stitutes: The James Martin Biodiversity Institute, The
Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology and the
Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU). The
main Department is located in the Tinbergen Building
in the University’s Science Area. The Department also
runs the John Krebs Field Station in Wytham Woods
and Tubney House, which houses WildCRU. Linked to
the Tinbergen Building is the multi-disciplinary Peter
Medawar Building for Pathogen Research with high-
grade containment facilities.
The Department is unusual in having about the same
number of independently funded Research Fellows as
Faculty. 58 members of the Department were included
in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, resulting in
a year-on-year increase in funding of 42% from that
source.
In 2010 the Department was given an Athena Swan Sil-
ver award in recognition of its success at promoting the
careers of women.
Evolutionary biology has been an historical strength of
the Department (W.D. Hamilton and Richard Dawkins
were former members). In addition to the contin-
ued presence of Professor Alan Grafen and Professor
Paul Harvey CBE FRS, its research presence has been
strengthened in recent years by several new faculty
appointments (for example Professor Charles Godfray
FRS, Professor Peter Holland FRS, Dr Judith Mank,
Dr Oliver Pybus, Professor Stuart West and Professor
Kathy Willis), the recruitment of many research fel-
lows (for example Drs Tom Bell, Craig MacLean, Andy
Gardner, Ashleigh Griﬃth, and Stuart Wigby), in-
creased grant income (particularly from the ERC), and
continued investment in sequencing facilities. Taken
together, there are many potential collaborators in the
Department who might assist the development of the
successful applicant’s own research group. Outside the
Department, many Departments and research groups
in the Medical Sciences Division oﬀer further opportu-
nities for collaboration and access to facilities.October 1, 2010 EvolDir 61

Hello,
In an old posting from Evoldir I found someone pointing

solution around this.

deployment, training requirements, etc. After we draft
it, the position paper will be put forth for a period of
public comment before ﬁnal recommendations to GBIF.
In order to put together the position paper, we solicit
your opinions, experiences, needs, and information on
resources you already in place about Knowledge Orga-
nization for biodiversity research. Please go to http:/-
/surveymonkey.com/GBIFKOSurvey to participate in
the survey.
We especially value your input about points you feel
the survey doesn’t cover.

Original query:
I would be interested to know whether anyone has tried
extracting DNA from molted insect cuticles.
Responses:October 1, 2010 EvolDir 69
I have done it a few times, with variable success. The
main issue is to keep PCR analyses restricted to short
fragments, at least at ﬁrst until you prove it works! I
tend to put the whole cuticle in a suitable volume of
the following buﬀer (enough to cover)
10mM Tris
10mM NaCl
5mM CaCl
2.5mM EDTA
10% ﬁnal volume Prot K solution (may be overkill to
use this much) 40mM DTT 2% ﬁnal volume SDS
Then incubate for some hours/overnight at 55C. The
cuticle won’t dissolve, but should yield some DNA.
I then purify the liquid using something like a Qiaquick
PCR clean up kit (you just pretend the buﬀer is a
PCR....) and elute into a small amount of EB (say
50ul).
>
Many years ago we did some tests on molted butter-
ﬂy cuticles (I don’t even remember the species) using a
Guanidium/silica particles method byGerloﬀ et. al. (I
guess this is the primary reference).
Results were very good, but we tested just a few sam-
ples. I would deﬁnitely do some more test if I was on
such a project.
>
We have had OK DNA from larval butterﬂy head cap-
sules, and from Onychophoran shed skins.
>
Try searching google scholar for “exuviae DNA”. Ex-
traction protocols have been developed for many diﬀer-
ent arthropods/insects.
>
My lab has tremendous success in getting mitochonrial
sequences from empty ﬂy puparia from various families.
Getting nuclear genes appears to be more diﬃcult, as
you might expect, and we haven’t yet done much. We
are in the ﬁnal stages of manuscript preparation on the
mitochondrial data.
>
I have successfully extracted DNA from the pupal ex-
uviae of bees. I had hoped to use these for non-
destructive genotyping at microsatellite loci. However,
I ﬁnd that the genotyping results are highly inconsis-
tent - I was getting diﬀerent allele calls on each separate
run. I did not invest too much energy in troubleshoot-ing before giving up. You might be able to get bet-
ter consistency with more replicates, as is standard for
mammalian fecal samples. Best of luck!

DNA from FormalinFixedBone
answers
Dear list:
My request for protocols for getting DNA out of bone
and formalin-ﬁxed generated lots of response. Thanks
for your time and information! Below is a collection of
all the responses so far. I can’t comment on the eﬃcacy
of any one of them yet, but I’m working on it.
Thanks, Steve
**
If you are not having success I suspect your problems
are one/some of the below
a) There is absolutely no DNA in the samples - in par-
ticular if the material was in formalin for more than ca.
12-24 hours it will have been heavily crosslinked, and
even fragmented if it was in unbuﬀered formalin
b) There is DNA but the primers you are using are
targeting too big a fragment.
How old are the samples and how long were the ﬁxed
ones ﬁxed, and how long ago where they ﬁxed?
In general, a simply and eﬀective bone protocol is that
by Rohland et al, attached. If that doesn’t work, and
you are using really short PCRs (ca 100bp) my guess is
it won’t work.
For formalin, I once did a lot of work on it. Please see70 EvolDir October 1, 2010
the extremely tedious paper that I wrote as a result. As
you will gather from it, heat + alkali can help matters
(the Shi 2004 paper I cite), but in general by increasing
yield only. If there is no DNA...it won’t do much.
Happy to help with any speciﬁc questions.

Hi Steve,
Dealing with formalin-ﬁxed material is not an easy task,
as you might already know. We recently published a
paper using a new method based on Tetramethylsilane
(TMS)-Chelex to reduce costs compared with Fang et
al. (2002). Most importantly, we observed that nei-
ther an indigestible matrix of cross-linked protein nor
soluble PCR inhibitors impede PCR success when deal-
ing with formalin-ﬁxed material. Instead, ampliﬁcation
success from formalin-ﬁxed tissue appears to depend on
the presence of unmodiﬁed DNA in the extracted sam-
ple. We were not able to get DNA sequences out of ev-
ery sample, but we provide a ’test’ to check if DNA will
be useful for PCR. You can obtain a pdf of our paper
athttp://www.icm.csic.es/scimar/index.php/secId/6/-
IdArt/3907/ I hope this helps. Cheers,
**
Dear Steve, Take a look on this article ( http://-
www.pnas.org/content/105/40/15464.ﬁgures-only ).
The authors extracted DNA from museum specimens
(mostly bones) of the giant tortoises of Galapagos.
Take care

Hi Steve,
I think you’re wasting your time with formalin-ﬁxed tis-
sues, as this issue has appeared on EvolDir about twice
or thrice a year for ﬁfteen years...but you should be able
to get DNA from the carapace. For ideas, see

Steve,
I saw your message this morning on Evoldir. Coinci-
dentally, I am working on a very similar problem with
the goal of extracting DNA from turtle claws. We have
had success with fresh tissue and we have been able to
amplify a 630 bp fragment from the mtDNA control re-
gion of painted turtles. During the past month, we have
been conducting experiments where we expose claws
to buﬀered formalin for 48 hours followed by 4-5 days
in 70% EtOH (modeling museum protocol), and then
attempting extraction using a modiﬁed protocol from
the Qiagen blood and tissue kit (basically the addition
of DTT, additional proteinase K, and longer digestion
times). So far the results are not too encouraging but
we are actively trying some diﬀerent things and have
some claws from specimens of diﬀerent collection date
from the Field Museum that we will test once we’re
conﬁdent in a protocol.

Euglenozoa primers
Dear all,
I am looking for non-18S primers suitable for Bodonidae
(Euglenozoa). They need not be very speciﬁc, but they
should preferably be known to amplify something not
too far from Bodonidae. I aim to look upon supposedly
closely related species from mostly pure cultures.
I am aware of this paper
http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org.ep.fjernadgang.kb.dk/-
content/23/3/615.full.pdf+html?sidja3816f-d6a8-4f7e-

elongation factor 2 (EF-2), cytosolic heat shock protein
70 (HSP70), and cytosolic heat shock protein 90
(HSP90)) for one Bodonidae species (Rhynchomonas
nasuta) found with degenerate primers.
However, I would like to hear any good suggestions for
more rapidly evolving loci and/or useful nondegener-
ate primers, too. Any suggestions or direction towards
useful literature on the subject would be greatly appre-
ciated.

EvoDevo funding
Dear Colleague,
This email is to announce a new funding and network-
ing opportunity for researchers in evolutionary and eco-
logical developmental biology: a National Science Foun-
dation Research Coordination Evo-Devo-Eco Network
called EDEN ( http://edenrcn.com/ ).
The major aims of EDEN are the following: To fund
research exchange grants allowing active interchange of
tools and techniques among labs working on emerging
model systems. To fund undergraduate internships in
the ﬁeld of Evo-Devo-Eco with an emphasis on emerg-
ing model systems. To document the tools and tech-
niques being used and developed in these organisms
and make them publicly available for future users. To
promote interactions across the Evo-Devo-Eco commu-
nity through conference funding and the sponsorship
of workshops. EDEN’s ﬁrst deadline for funding ap-
plications is October 31, 2010. You can read about
the funding available at http://edenrcn.com/funding/
. If you are working at the interface of the ﬁelds of
development, evolution, and ecology, and/or with non-
traditional model organisms, you have probably found
yourself developing new techniques and tools. Perhaps
you have used well-established protocols from tradi-
tional model organisms as a starting point, but have
had to modify these protocols by painstaking trial and
error, without the beneﬁt of a large research community
to support work on your organism.
If you are working with well-established model organ-October 1, 2010 EvolDir 73
isms, perhaps you would like to add an evolutionary
or comparative dimension to your work, but have not
worked with other organisms before.
With the support of the National Science Foundation,
we have developed a new research coordination network
called EDEN (Evo-Devo-Eco Network) to help address
these challenges. You can read about EDEN’s activi-
ties and opportunities at http://edenrcn.com/ . Please
consider “joining” EDEN by ﬁlling out a brief survey
about your lab’s areas of expertise. You can complete
the survey on our website at
http://edenrcn.com/join/ or by clicking here
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JoinEDEN This
survey will allow your lab to be added to a searchable
database of scientists, organisms and techniques that
will soon be available on the EDEN website. With this
database, other researchers in development, evolution
and ecology will be able to to learn about your work,
hopefully facilitating new and useful networks and col-
laborations.
We encourage you to go to EDEN’s website to read
more about it, and to check back frequently for future
calls for applications, protocols, and workshop and sym-
posia announcements.
Please feel free to email us at edenrcn@fas.harvard.edu
with questions about the program, and forward this
email to colleagues who you think would be interested
in EDEN.

Evolution textbook Nonmajors
Hello all!
I am teaching a non-majors evolution course ( http:/-
/www.christopherxjjensen.com/teaching/courses/-
evolution/ ) and have been using the McGraw-Hill
textbook “An Introduction to Biological Evolution”
by Kenneth Kardong. This book is working but I am
considering a switch to a diﬀerent book.
For those of you who teach non-majors evolution, what
textbook are you using? Do you like this textbook?
What are its strengths and weaknesses?
Also, I am curious if anyone has thought about using
the newly-released book by Carl Zimmer “The Tangled
Bank”. It’s not exactly a textbook, but seems fairly
accessible to non-majors.
Finally, if anyone knows of an analogous list for evolu-
tionary biology where I might post this, let me know
that as well.
Looking forward to and also very grateful for any help
you can give.
Thanks, Chris http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/

Fecal DNA degradation
Hello all.74 EvolDir October 1, 2010
I appreciate all the replies. It seems other have similar
issues, and protocols have been adapted to circumvent
the problem, but no one has pinpointed why this would
happen. Does the DNA actually degrade? Or, does
something that co-extracts modify the DNA so it be-
comes inaccessible to PCR?
I have also contacted QIAGEN technical support on the
matter, but they have not given me an answer yet.
I pasted below the responses.
Cheers.
Anders.

Hi Anders,
Here in the lab we have had the same problem with pri-
mate fecal DNA. We collect fecal samples in RNA later
(1:1 ratio) but I suspect that post-extraction degra-
dation will be similar regardless of the conservation
method. We also use the QIAamp Stool Kit.
I’m not aware of any reagent you can add to the DNA
eluate to delay DNA degradation and not prevent (e.g.
EDTA) downstream enzymatic reactions.
Here is what I usually do in order to get the most from
my DNA extractions.
I do my ﬁnal eluate in two elution steps of 75 ul (AE
buﬀer) to collect a ﬁnal volume of 150 ul of DNA (the
two 75 ul aliquots are mixed together in the same tube
so as to have a homogeneous eluate). I follow Morin
et al. (2001), so I quantify the DNA with a qPCR
to determine how many repetitions will be necessary
for microsatellite genotyping. I then split the eluate
in either one 50 ul + one 100ul aliquots or three 50 ul
aliquots. I keep the ﬁrst 50 ul aliquot in the fridge to
run PCRs. The other aliquots (one 100-ul or two of
50-ul) is kept frozen to be used after the ﬁrst aliquot is
gone. I also try to run as many loci as possible (with
repetitions) within the ﬁrst week of extraction. With
these precautions I avoid too many freeze and thaw cy-
cles, which seems to increase DNA degradation. At the
bench, I also keep the DNA extracts on ice.
Finally, if I have, say 200 poop samples, I usually work
on small batches (multiples of 8 - e.g. 16 or 24 - because
it ﬁts well the 96-well plates) from DNA extraction to
result. Thus my DNA extracts will not be kept frozen
for several weeks before PCRs.
I hope this helps, Abra¸ co. Paulo.
PS: We collect fresh scats and keep them at -20 oC.

HI, Anders,
I have a student working on Asiatic black bear and en-
countered similar problem. DNA stopped working after
a few months, but not a few days. She is now drying
DNA on PCR plate once they passed the DNA quality
test, to prevent further degradation.
Thanks!

Hi Anders, Before extraction, the best is to put the
faeces in alcohol for max. 24 h. and then to transfer
in silica until extraction. this will enhance the qual-
ity of the extract. then it depends what you are doing
with the sample: If the goal is to assess the herbivore’s
diet look at the mat & meth of the valentini (MolEcol-
Res 2009) and Pegard (JAFC 2009) papers for DNA
extraction. if your goal is to got the herbivore’s geno-
type look at the Naderi (PNAS 2008) and Rezaei (MPE
2010) papers
good luck cheers

Hi Anders, I have seen degradation, but not over this
short a time period. I’d suggest a couple of things:
1) In the ﬁeld, I’d suggest she use Queen’s College
Buﬀer (some call it DETS) to preserve as much as she
can of the cellular material she’s collecting. The proto-
col for making 1000 ml is:
Queens College Buﬀer (20% DMSO, 0.25 M EDTA, 100
mM Tris, pH 7.5, saturated with NaCl):
Per Liter:
200 mL DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE (DMSO) 250 mL
1 M ETHYLENEDIAMINETETRAACETIC ACID
(EDTA) 100 mL 1 M TRIS, pH 7.5
Saturate with SODIUM CHLORIDE (Salt, NaCl).
Add sterile water to 900 ml and add NaCl until the
solution is saturated again, then add sterile water untilOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 75
you reach 1 L.
I add only enough to each sample to fully cover it. If
using the buﬀer isn’t feasible, she could try drying her
samples in the ﬁeld using silica gel. I only use Longmire
buﬀer for blood or good tissue samples.
2) We start our extractions with an overnight incuba-
tion with Proteinase K - that might help.
3) How large are the fragments you’re amplifying? If
they’re nuclear fragments over about 250 bp, I’d suggest
you break them up into multiple overlapping fragments
which might increase your success on new and older
extractions.
4) I aliquot about 25 µl of extracted DNA for PCR, and
keep the rest frozen. If she’s not already doing that, it
might retard degradation.
5) If she’s not already adding BSA to her PCR, she
might add that to see if her extracts still contain some
kind of inhibitors.

Fecal DNA extraction
Hello all.
I have a student working on a tropical herbivore. She
collects samples in longmire buﬀer, and has extracted
DNA using the QIAGEN Stool Kit, following the hu-
man stool protocol, with only a short 10min proteinase
K incubation step. PCRs work in about 60-70% of the
samples, but the DNA stops amplifying after only a
few days from extraction, even while storing at -20 oC.
I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience,
or ideas on how to reduce this rapid degradation.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Anders.

Genotyping DNAsample preparation
Hello all,
I am graduate student preparing DNA samples to
be genotyped for about 6 SNPs using TaqMan. I’mhaving trouble quantifying the samples using a Nano
drop. These samples were extracted from saliva, whole
genome ampliﬁed, and stored at -80 for about 2 years. I
took them out this summer and stored them in a normal
freezer. My attempts to determine the concentration
of the samples using a Nanodrop have failed as some
of the samples have a white residue at the bottom of
the tubes and Nanodrop readings indicate a substantial
amount of impurities and give really low conc. These
samples worked ﬁne two years ago, I’m not sure what
the problem is now.
I’m trying to ﬁgure out ways to clean the samples. I
heard that heating the samples to 95C could dissolve
the residue. I am limited by amount for each sample,
roughly 25ul. If any of you have any suggestions on
how to clean the samples, I would be most grateful.
Thanks,

George Williams 1926-2010
Hi all. George C. Williams died on Wednesday, Septem-
ber 8th. I and many others would say that at the time
of his death, he was the greatest living evolutionary
biologist. His 1966 book “Adaptation and natural se-
lection” is a cornerstone of contemporary behavioural
ecology, evolutionary psychology, and much else, and
is still very much worth reading. Below is a lovely au-
tobiographical piece that George wrote a few years ago
(lifted from Edge; I didn’t just give the link ’cuz there’s
a lot of blather to wade through before this gem, but
if you want the link it’s <www.edge.org/documents/-
williams index.html >. George was extremely self-
eﬀacing. Don’t be fooled by this! Gather ye rosebuds
while ye may. Martin
—–
My interest in evolution started in the summer of 1947,
when I spent six weeks in the Painted Desert with a
paleontologist named Sam Welles, who had a group of
students there, oﬃcially in a summer course, but we
spent most of the time swinging picks and shovels, dig-
ging fossils, as part of Welles’ research project. He was a
specialist in Triassic amphibians. Evenings were spent
sitting around the campﬁre talking about things like
evolution. For the ﬁrst time in my life, people - real
biologists, real scholars - were willing to sit and listenOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 77
to my opinions. I was twenty one years old. I cer-
tainly became interested in many aspects of evolution
then, and shortly after that I signed up at the Univer-
sity of California at Berkeley for a course in evolution
with Ledyard Stebbins, who at the time, and for quite
a while thereafter, was the world’s primary expert in
evolution with respect to things botanical. Stebbins’
course introduced me to Theodosius Dobzhansky’s Ge-
netics and The Origin of Species. Stebbins was great,
but Dobzhansky’s book was what got me interested in
natural selection as a process.
At the University of Chicago, my job was strictly teach-
ing. I was in their early-entrant undergraduate program
- taught freshmen and sophomores biology. They had
a great-books approach. We read Darwin, Mendel, and
others. Also I attended seminars by people such as
Alfred Emerson, the termite specialist and recognized
authority on things evolutionary. I found his ideas ab-
solutely unacceptable. That motivated me to do some-
thing. If it was biology Emerson was discussing, I would
be better oﬀ selling insurance.
I remember especially his lecture on the role of death
in evolution. He was all in favor of death, and said
that the reason we grow old and die is to make room
for successors, so that they can have a chance. This
seemed so totally impossible, given that evolution pro-
ceeds by natural selection. There was absolutely no
logical way you could reconcile his ideas with Darwin-
ism, even though he claimed to be a Darwinist.
This initiated my ﬁrst theoretical obsession: the evo-
lution of senescence - the decline in adaptive perfor-
mance with age. You can’t run as fast at sixty as you
could at thirty. On the way home that evening, talk-
ing about the problem with my wife, I independently
came up with an idea that Peter Medawar is chieﬂy re-
sponsible for and published in 1952, although he may
have published something that foreshadowed it in the
1940s - and that is that the eﬀectiveness of selection
in maintaining adaptation is essentially the product of
reproductive value and survival.
The survival factor is easier to appreciate. If you’re
more likely to be alive at thirty than at sixty, then
selection will be more eﬀective at maintaining adapta-
tion at thirty than at sixty. At an age you’d be ex-
tremely unlikely to survive to, such as one hundred
years old, adaptation would be a lost cause, and se-
lection wouldn’t be concerned with it.
As the eﬀectiveness of selection declines, the eﬀective-
ness of its products declines. This explains the rising
mortality rate that comes with age. It seemed to me at
the time, and still does, that this is an inevitable con-
clusion, arising from just the simple fact of mortality. Ifthere’s any possibility of dying, at any age, then you’re
less likely to be alive at a later age than you are at an
earlier age.
Another one of Alfred Emerson’s ideas was that evo-
lution is much more concerned with cooperation than
with competition. It seemed to me to be very much
the other way around, and that there was something
very special about the social insects which accounted for
their extreme cooperativeness. That special thing was
their kinship - high levels of kinship within the colony.
This was the focus of a theoretical paper I published in
1957. It was a model of natural selection between fam-
ilies; now I think that’s a silly way to do it, but at the
time I wasn’t smart enough to think of the kin-selection
idea, which was some years later worked out by William
D. Hamilton. In extreme models, this kind of selection
can lead to things like forgoing reproduction, if in

GeorgeWilliams death
George C. Williams, 1926-2010
George C. Williams, a renowned evolutionary biologist
and Professor Emeritus of Ecology and Evolution at
Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York,
passed away on September 8, 2010.
Professor Williams is widely regarded by peers in his
ﬁeld as one of the most inﬂuential and incisive evolu-
tionary theorists of the twentieth century, internation-
ally respected for having shaped conceptual progress
and new ﬁelds of research in evolutionary biology. He
advocated and helped to build a “science of adapta-
tion” that addresses the evolution of animal and human
behaviors, organisms’ life histories, and other complex
features. Together with Randolph Nesse, professor of
psychiatry at the University of Michigan, he launched
the ﬁeld of “Darwinian medicine,” an evolutionary ap-
proach to human health and disease.
The study of evolution in the 1950’s was based on ad-
vances in the previous two decades that had established
a powerful, very general theory of evolution by natural
selection, cast in terms of genetic change of species. It
applied to organisms’ features in the abstract; what was78 EvolDir October 1, 2010
lacking, for the most part, was analysis of the causes of
evolution of various puzzling features that vary among
species. Why, for example, do some organisms repro-
duce sexually and others asexually? Why do some
species have a short life span, whereas tortoises and
redwoods can live for more than a century? How do we
account for cooperation in social animals, when natu-
ral selection is based on selﬁsh, individual advantage?
To the extent that biologists addressed such questions,
they generally supposed that these traits beneﬁt the
species as a whole, even if they are harmful to the
individual. Senescence and death, for example, were
thought to provide space and resources for a vigorous
new generation, and so promote the species’ welfare.
Although Williams’s research area was the ecology and
life history of ﬁshes, he started to address such ques-
tions in 1957, when he published a theory to account
for the evolution of senescence and short life span; this
paper is now recognized in all major biological works
on gerontology as a foundation for understanding the
genetic and evolutionary bases of the age distribution
of mortality. In the same year, he and his wife Doris
were among the ﬁrst to advance the modern theory
for the evolution of cooperative behavior that is harm-
ful to the cooperating individual but beneﬁcial to the
group. Williams, adhering to Darwin’s conception of
natural selection, sought explanations based on the re-
productive success of individual organisms and their
genes, and rejected hypotheses based on “group selec-
tion” that promotes the “good of the species.” He de-
veloped these ideas at length in Adaptation and Natu-
ral Selection: A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary
Thought (1966), which had enormous inﬂuence and im-
mediately established his reputation as one of the most
original, incisive thinkers in evolutionary biology. In
this book, in other publications, and in conversation,
Williams had a gift for clear thinking about complex
problems, and for explaining them in disarmingly sim-
ple terms.
Although much of evolutionary theory takes the form
of mathematical models, Williams made sparing use
of math, and developed almost entirely verbal the-
ory. Nonetheless, he helped to establish the founda-
tions for new subdisciplines within modern evolutionary
biology, including behavioral ecology and sociobiology,
sexual selection, and the evolution of sexual reproduc-
tion and reproductive systems, to which Williams de-
voted another book (Sex and Evolution, 1975). Richard
Dawkins and others credit Williams with pioneering a
reductionist approach to evolution, by analyzing how
mutational changes in a characteristic would aﬀect the
reproductive success (ﬁtness) of an individual organism
or of the gene itself (i.e., the “selﬁsh gene” paradigm).Despite some controversy, this approach is widely con-
sidered to have enhanced the explanatory power of evo-
lutionary theory. Williams published ﬁve other books,
including Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Dar-
winian Medicine, with Randolph Nesse (1994), that
shows why an understanding of evolution is helpful
and even necessary in the health sciences. Since then,
Darwinian medicine has been the subject of numerous
books and symposia, and is beginning to inﬂuence some
medical school curricula.
Williams was born on May 12, 1926. After serving in
the U.S. Army, he enrolled in the University of Cal-
ifornia at Berkeley and received a B.A. in zoology in
1949. He received his M. A. (1952) and Ph.D. (1955)
at UCLA, held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Univer-
sity of Chicago for one year, and became an Assistant
Professor at Michigan State University in 1955. In 1960
he moved to the nascent State University of New York
at Stony Brook as

Goat Sheep hair DNAExtraction
Dear colleagues,
Does anybody knows a good protocol for DNA extrac-
tion from goat and sheep hair? (commercial or pref-

from the animals’ tails. In addition, Id like to know if
anybody could suggest me the best way of storing these
kind of material. I’ll appreciate any information on this
topic.

How to break crosslinks
Dear evoldir members,
Last month Steve Kimble posted a message entitled
“Other: Extraction of genomic DNA from bone and
formalin-ﬁxed”. Steve kindly posted all the responses
he had received. One of them mentioned ways to break
crosslinks. Here is the exact response: “The other
form of damage is cross-links which can occur between
the DNA and other molecules like metals and proteins
(amongst others). There has been some research to de-
velop methods of cleaving these cross-links oﬀ to allow
the DNA to be analyzed”.
I don’t know if this referred to using heat or enzymatic
treatments but I am curious to know if members here
have any idea on how to break cross-links without dam-
aging nucleic acids any further.
Thank you

To experienced ABI 3730XL users,
I am requesting some guidance regarding the use of in-
ternal size standards for microsatellite genotyping on
the ABI 3730XL.
In our lab we have been using two diﬀerent size stan-
dards (McLab500 and Applied biosystem’s, GeneS-
can600). When creating bin sets for markers there
seems to be around a 2bp diﬀerence between these size
standards (has anyone else noticed this?). We can eas-
ily get around this problem by setting up two seperate,
standardised bin sets.
We would prefer however, if we could just stick to using
the McLab500 alone (because it is much cheaper), but
we are unsure if this size standard is accurate enough.
In the 3730xl the 250bp fragment within size standards
is inaccurately called and so it is recommended that it
be excluded when analyzing samples.This means that
there is a 100bp jump from the 200 to the 300bp frag-
ment. Is this an acceptable distance between reference
fragments for accurate allele calls? We also have some
alleles that occur beyond 500bp (up to 590bp). The re-
sults from an in-house test suggest that there is nothing
to worry about as alleles are accurately called within
established bins for controls, but this has only been as-
sessed for a small number of individuals.
Any input would be greatly appreciated

Multiplexing ﬂuorophores
Has anyone used IDT’s MAX ﬂuorophore in multiplex
with AB’s LIZ size standard? I can’t ﬁnd data on the
abs/emission spectra for LIZ. VIC (538/554) is compat-
ible with LIZ, but IDT doesn’t oﬀer VIC, and recom-
mend either HEX (538/555), JOE (529/555), or MAX
(524/557), instead. The Yale sequencing center says
that while HEX is not compatible with LIZ, JOE is; this
is perplexing given that HEX and VIC have nearly iden-
tical spectral characteristics. I’d prefer to buy HEX or80 EvolDir October 1, 2010
MAX because they’re considerably cheaper than JOE.
Anyone want to weigh in on this? Thanks, Bob Marra

SGS analysis inbreeding plant
Hello,
I am a PhD student working on an annual plant which
is highly inbreeding and seeds are dispersed either pas-
sively or by ants. I would like to perform some ﬁne-scale
spatial genetic structure (SGS) analyses on mapped
samples collected at very close distances to each other,
using microsatellites, to infer ’neighbourhood size’, the
scale of gene ﬂow by rare pollination events and seed
dispersal, and to see if habitat changes correlate with
genetic diﬀerentiation.
Could anyone recommend any software programs
for such SGS analyses that do not require the
species/populations to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium?

Dear Crichton, I suggest to use Spagedi 1.3. ( http:/-
/ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/Software.html ). This is very good
program and, actualy all using this program. Regard-
ing the Hardy-Weiwberg equilibrium, I suggest to use
the Loissele et al. (1995) method. This method not
assume HW equilibrium.
Best regards, Alexandre

Dear Rhiannon,
software for analysis of spatial genetic structure by
essence do not assume that the genotype frequencies
correspond to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, as spatial
genetic structure is a deviation from random mating,
a major hypothesis of H-W model. If your markers
are co-dominant, then you can use any software for
SGS analysis, including Spagedi by my colleague Olivier
Hardy and myself (see Vekemans & Hardy 2004 Molecu-
lar Ecology 13:921- for practical considerations on SGS
analyses and a review of the empirical literature consid-
ering among others the eﬀect of mating system on pat-
terns of SGS; and Hardy & Vekemans 2002 Mol. Ecol.

athttp://ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/Software.html ), but there
are many others.

Hi,
Depending on how many plants & markers, and par-
ticularly what proportion of the (local) population you
are surveying in each generation, you could presumably
take a pedigree-based approach (and infer the relation-
ships between all the sampled plants)?
For example, Masterbayes:
http://wildevolution.biology.ed.ac.uk/jhadﬁeld/-
software.html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/-
doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03050.x/abstract

8137.2010.03438.x/pdf http://cran.r-project.org/-
web/packages/MasterBayes/vignettes/Tutorial.pdf I
imagine this might work if you are looking at (e.g.) all
candidate parents in an area plus several seeds from
each mother in that area.
Regards!
Darren

I’d suggest spatial autocorrelation. It can be done
on the Genalax package and has been used on lots of
botanical species. It’s particularly appropriate where
you have individuals (rather than populations) spread
across an area and want to make inferences about con-
nectivity.
I’ve attached a paper I’ve used it on (although it’s not
a perfect example of it’s use by any means. However, it
should give you the references you need to investigate
further!

Software MetaPIGA2
Dear all,
We are glad to announce the release of *MetaPIGA2*
(BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11: 379), a robust imple-
mentation of the Metapopulation Genetic Algorithm
(metaGA) for large phylogeny inference under Maxi-
mum Likelihood (PNAS, 99: 10516-10521 (2002))
In MetaPIGA2, the metaGA is implemented together
with: -Complex substitution models (including GTR),
-Discrete Gamma rate heterogeneity, -The possibility
to partition data.
Importantly, MetaPIGA2 will make you happy if you
like using a graphical user interface (GUI) BUT it
should also make you happy if you hate using a GUI.
Indeed, MetaPIGA provides BOTH: - An extensiveOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 83
GUI for parameters setting, following run progress, and
manipulating result trees, and - High customization
through manual batch ﬁles and command line process-
ing.
Furthermore, if you need to use batch ﬁles (for example,
to run them on a distant server) but hate to type the
commands yourself, MetaPIGA2 allows you to generate
batch ﬁles through the GUI.
MetaPIGA2 also implements the Likelihood Ratio Test
(LRT), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for auto-
mated selection of substitution models that best ﬁt the
data ... such that you don’t need using 3 softwares
before starting analyze your data.
MetaPIGA2 uses standard formats for data sets and
trees, is platform independent, runs in 32 and 64-bits
systems, and TAKES ADVANTAGE OF MULTIPRO-
CESSOR & MULTICORE COMPUTERS.
MetaPIGA2 is described in: Helaers & Milinkovitch;

Software TREEFINDER Update
Dear Colleagues,
It might be necessary to update my Treeﬁnder soft-
ware, to recompile it for newer computers and to de-
velop newer installation procedures. I could also imple-
ment deeper search levels and some other extensions.
But so far the academic system has been unable to of-
fer me some adequate compensation for my work. My
questions are:
1. Is there anybody interested in having updated
Treeﬁnder software?
2. If so, is there anybody willing and able to motivate
me to do such updates?
According to my cultural background, an “adequate”
compensation for good work would be something that
enabled me to buy a nice house with a garden and raise
a big family HERE AT MY HOME PLACE. A tradi-
tional permanent income. And I am not interested in
working on somebody else’s projects as long as I have
more useful ideas of my own.
But the acedemic system selects people who are good at
doing what they are told and good at migrating from
place to place all the time. It selects people who ac-
cept miserable salaries that neither allow raising a big
family nor buying a nice house with a garden. The aca-
demic system produces too many professors and hardly
any inventors, thinkers. In the academic system one
hardly has any time to THINK. The academic system84 EvolDir October 1, 2010
discriminates against people like me. This raises further
questions:
3. Is there any advantage in selecting cheap and ﬂexible
but possibly incompetent scientists?
4. Is such an academic system useful?
5. If so, for whom?
6. If not, what are good strategies to get rid of such a
system?
7. Do we need an alternative academic system that
supports free scientists with own ideas?
I know that most of you are what the system has se-
lected so far and will therefore agree with the estab-
lished system in many aspects. Whereas those who
would not agree have already been excluded. But I
nevertheless ask.
The other point is that updating Treeﬁnder requires
several new computers, compiler software, internet ser-
vices etc. that I cannot aﬀord because somebody else
gets my income.

Solanaceae phylogeny
Dear Evoldirians,
I would like to ﬁnd the phylogenetic relationships
among some Solanaceae, which are hostplants for
neotropical butterﬂies. I see from recent publications
that there is a myriad of available markers (eg COSII
gene set, various ITS, ndhF, trnLF, matK...). I need
to select a combination of loci that would enbale to re-
cover both shallow and deep relationships. Most of my
plants belong to the Solanum and Cestrum genera, but
I also have Lycianthes, Markea, Juanulloa, Physalis,
Larnax. In addition these loci should be easily ampli-
ﬁed, because my material is old, stored in silica at room
temperature and possibly degraded.
Could someone advise me on the best combination of
markers?
Many thanks,
Marianne

SouthAfrica Volunteers
EvolutionSmallMammals
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
2 open positions from January 2011 onwards
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relat-
ing to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting
graduate school, an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility
in the striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the
habitat is open, direct behavioral observations in the
ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are also expected to help with
maintenance of the research station (water pump, solar
power, etc.)
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to theOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 85
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 110 Euro) must be paid for accommo-
dation at the research station. For students with their
own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250 (approx.
135 Euro) per month applies. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2250 or
250 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 400 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
two volunteers starting January 2011. The volunteer
project is ongoing, i.e. positions will also be available

Working as a ﬁeld assistant in Goegap Nature Reserve
A report by Romy H¨ oppli, student at the University of
Zurich, who staid in Goegap June to August 2008
Blue skies without a single cloud for six weeks rocky
mountains with little vegetation yellow, orange and
pink ﬁelds of ﬂowers in whatever direction you look
small mammals, lizards and birds in our front yard
and Mountain Zebras, Springbok and Ostrich right next
door...
This was my time at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-
tion in Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa! During
six weeks from the beginning of July until the middle of
August I’ve been living here, studying mice, experienc-
ing nature like never before and being part of a small
community where there was always something to laughand joke about!
After arriving in Goegap, right the next morning my
scientiﬁc adventure in South Africa began: Setting and
checking traps, nest observations and radio-tracking
were our daily routine. While I got bitten by the mice
quite often in the beginning and my right middle ﬁn-
ger was scarred all over, I improved quickly shaking the
mice out of the traps, weighing them and checking the
number of the ear tag. Other duties like cleaning the
cages of the mice in the captive colony, washing the dirt
from probably several months out of the traps, painting
the new Wendy House and putting in a ﬂoor

Spatial autocorrelation analysis
Dear evoldir members,
We have carried out a spatial autocorrelation analysis
using GenAlEx software. We have analyzed a “puta-
tive plant population” that include two clusters of sep-
arated individuals by 50 meters. When we considered
all the individuals of the population the genetic struc-
ture detected was 50 meters. But, when we analyzed
each group of individuals separately, the genetic struc-
ture were 5 and 7 meters, respectively. So, should we
consider the whole “population” or each group sepa-
rately in order to determinate the genetic structure of
the species?
Thank in advance,

TreeAnnotator branch problem
Dear all,
I run BEAST to construct the phylogentic tree of 138
orthologs , with the chain length of 6E7. However, there
existed some branches with 0-posterior probability in
the tree generated by treeanotator, and if I run the
GMYC on it, a problem will be showed as following:
> tree <- read.nexus(“C: \\Documents and
Settings \\sli\\My Documents \\phoB \\gamma 138\\138original treeannotator.out.tree”)
> test1 <- gmyc(tree,method =
“single”,interval=c(0,138)) node T loglik 2 -0.2634113
778.7273
Error in optim(c(1, 1), l.min2, method = “Nelder-
Mead”, control list(fnscale = -1)) : function cannot be
evaluated at initial parameters
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In optimise(l.null, interval = interval, maximum =
1) : NA/Inf replaced by maximum positive value
2: In log(lik) : NaNs produced
No idea which step I did wrong.
The tree ﬁle and and the screenshot of part of the tree
(demonstrated with FigureTree) are attached here.
Another question:
If I don’t want such a long chain length and such a
huge trees ﬁle in the end, can I just simply combine the
trees ﬁle from multiple runs using Logcombiner with a
shorter chain length? For example, Now I’m running
BEAST on 3 computers each with the chain length 2E7.
But will the ESS vaules decrease a lot after the combi-
nation of the 3 results? Is it necessary for me to choose
one analysis step, e.g.“Bayesian skyline reconstruction”
to combine the results?
Thanks a lot!

perennial relative, and switchgrass, a potential peren-
nial biofuel grass. They will conduct analysis and de-
velop software for an ongoing research program focused
on the natural variation inherent in perennial grass
genomes for the dissection of complex traits. The re-
search will focus speciﬁcally on (1) identifying the novel
genes in perennial grasses that are lacking in maize, (2)
identify the alleles involved in adaptation of perennial
grasses to North American environments. Our longer
term goal is to support the development of high perfor-
mance perennial grass crops.
Responsibilities:
* Develop the analysis pipelines for genotype by se-
quencing without the aid of a reference genome, using
next generation sequencing libraries from Tripsacum
and switchgrass. * Construct high density genetic, di-
versity, and QTL maps of Tripsacum and switchgrass
to facilitate the identiﬁcation of key genes. * Develop
analytic approaches for combining next generation se-
quencing with higher ploidy organisms.

Dalhousie MicrobeDiversity
The Doolittle, Bielawski and Beiko labs at Dalhousie
University, in collaboration with Olga Zhaxybayeva
(West Virginia) and Marc Ereshefsky (Calgary) are
looking for several PhD students and postdocs to join
the project “Modeling and mapping microbial diver-
sity and function with marker genes, genomes and
metagenomes”, recently funded by the Canadian In-
stitutes of Health Research as part of the Canadian
Microbiome Initiative. The main aim of this project
is to understand human-associated microbial commu-
nities not only in terms of who is there, but also in
terms of what key genetic and metabolic processes are
characteristic of diﬀerent clinical scenarios. This purely
bioinformatic project involves the analysis of large ge-
nomic and metagenomic datasets from public reposito-
ries and from several collaborating research groups.
Key elements of the project include
(i) Analysis of publicly available microbial genomic and
metagenomic datasets to delineate appropriate units
of diversity. To what extent is it useful to consider
microbial species and speciation as key determinants
of a microbiome? (ii) Uncovering the determinants
of phenotype for microbes and microbial communi-
ties. What important genes, metabolic and evolution-
ary processes (particularly neutral evolution, adapta-
tion, recombination, and lateral gene transfer) are char-
acteristic of complex individual and community pheno-
types (pathogen vs. commensal, healthy vs. diseased)?
(iii) Development and deployment of software. We will

Genetic diversity is a key characteristic of biological sys-
tems. Diversity allows populations to adapt to chang-
ing environments, or, for example, to evolve resistance
to parasitic infections. Technological advances have
made the measurement and analysis of genetic diversity
faster and more eﬃcient. The Genetic Diversity Centre
(GDC) at ETH Z¨ urich provides a technology, knowl-
edge, and education platform that meets the needs of
researchers from many diﬀerent ﬁelds. The GDC fosters
an academic community where students and peers from
various academic institutions meet, work, and discuss
their results and ideas. To strengthen these activities
the Velux Foundation oﬀers stays at the GDC as:
Velux Foundation Fellow at the Genetic Diversity Cen-
tre (GDC) ETH Z¨ urich
The Fellow will have the opportunity to work freely at
GDC on topics of mutual interest and can beneﬁt from
the academic environment of ETH and the University
of Zurich. Work can either be empirical, theoretical,
or conceptual. Possible topics are in the broader ﬁeld
of genetic diversity studies, including various extensions
such as expression study, proteomics, or community ge-
nomics. The Fellow will receive oﬃcial guest researcher
status at ETH Z¨ urich and ﬁnancial support for travel,
working expenses, and a modest honorarium during
his/her stay. The fellow will be expected to support
GDC’s training and education activities by sharing the
expertise in his/her ﬁeld. Post-graduate researchers at
all levels are eligible for this fellowship. It can cover
time periods from one month to a maximum of one
year. The fellowship program is available starting from
January 2011.
Applications can be made at any time. Please send
your CV, publication list, and a short statement (1-2
pages) on your planned activities at GDC to the: Direc-
tor (Prof. P. Schmid-Hempel), Genetic Diversity Cen-
tre (GDC), ETH Z¨ urich CHN E55, Universit¨ atsstrasse

PHD AND POSTDOC POSITIONS IN POPULA-
TION BIOLOGY AND GENETICS OF INFECTIOUS
DISEASES AT THE ETH ZURICH
Positions for two PhD student, a junior and a senior
postdoc are available in the groups of Sebastian Bon-
hoeﬀer and Roland Regoes at the ETH Zurich. In our
groups we study the population biology and genetics
of infectious diseases. For more information on our
groups see www.tb.ethz.ch . One of the PhD students
and the senior postdoc would work in the group of Se-
bastian Bonhoeﬀer. The broad research area of these
two positions will be the theoretical population genet-
ics of infectious disease (see www.tb.ethz.ch/research/-
Bonhoeﬀer ). Applicants for the PhD position should
have strong quantitative skills. We therefore encourage
people with a background in mathematics, biostatistics,
bioinformatics or physics to apply. For applicants for
the senior postdoc position a track-record in studying
the emergence and the control of drug-resistance is an
advantage. The postdoc position comes with a high
degree of independence, and it would be great if you
developed your own projects, possibly also involving
the more junior members of the group. A strong back-
ground in mathematical modelling and computation is
required for this position.
The other PhD student and the junior postdoc would
work with Roland Regoes, studying the population bi-
ology of immune responses against viruses. In the
last years Roland Regoes and his group members stud-
ied the dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing in
vivo, and the neutralization of HIV by antibodies (see
www.tb.ethz.ch/research/Regoes ), and the PhD stu-
dent and the postdoc could work on some of these top-
ics initially. While our research is conducted in close
collaboration with experimental immunology and virol-
ogy laboratories (eg Annette Oxenius and AlexandraTrkola), we are seeking candidates with strong quanti-
tative skills (for example, trained mathematicians, bio-
statisticians, or physicists).
The starting dates of these positions are fairly ﬂexible.
We envisage some time at the end of this year.
Our groups are strongly linked with the experimental
ecology group of Paul Schmid-Hempel, and the micro-
bial evolution group of Martin Ackermann at the In-
stitute of Integrative Biology of the ETH Zurich (see
http://www.ibz.ethz.ch/ for more details).
Zurich is a great place to live and to do research. It
is the home of two big universties (the University of
Zurich and the ETH), and is an attractive city in beau-
tiful surroundings with a multinational population and
many educational and recreational opportunities.
To apply send a letter describing your interest in
this position, a CV and the names and contact ad-
dresses of two referees by email to our secretary Rita
Jenny: rita.jenny@env.ethz.ch. Please write “Applica-
tion for postdoc/PhD position with Sebastian Bonhoef-
fer/Roland Regoes” into the subject line of your email.
The deadline of the application is October 31, 2010.
Informal enquires to roland.regoes@env.ethz.ch or se-

Engineering biosynthetic pathways in bacterial consor-
tia. One of the major promises of the nascent ﬁeld of
synthetic biology is to engineer bacteria for the produc-
tion of biomolecules that are relevant for therapeutic
and technological use. Currently synthetic engineering
of bacterial metabolism relies heavily on intuition and
experimental tweaking: we are still far from being able
to rationally engineer metabolic capabilities of bacteria.
Focusing on the biosynthetic pathway of Mitomycin C
(in Streptomyces Lavendulae), this project aims to in-
crease our ability to rationally design metabolic path-
ways. Our speciﬁc goals are to (i) increase Mitomycin
yields in S. Lavendulae by rational engineering of path-
way structure and enzyme regulation, (ii) improve im-
plementation of the Mitomycin pathway in other bac-
teria through segmentation over several microbial sub-
populations that can function as a consortium, and (iii)
to explore alternative Mitomycin-producing metabolic
network designs through sampling of the network space
[Bar-Even, A. et al PNAS 107, 2010] and in silico evo-
lution [Pfeiﬀer, T. et al PLoS Biol 3(7), 2005].
This project is part of the Engineering a Semi-Biotic
Immune System, a multi-lab, integrated project funded
by the EPSRC Flashlight Funding in Synthetic Biol-
ogy. Our long-term goal is a semi-biotic immune de-
vice, which will detect and react to the onset of disease
in its host subject. The outcomes of this advertised
post will interface and feed-in to experimental work.
In particular, the metabolic pathways resulting from
this theoretical work will be implemented in bacterial
consortia that will be housed in speciﬁcally designed
microﬂuidic devices.
The team behind Engineering a Semi-Biotic Immune
System comprises expertise in cell biology (Tavas-
soli Lab, University of Southampton and Huang Lab,
Sheﬃeld University), microﬂuidic devices (Yin Lab,
University of Glasgow), functional peptides (Miller
Lab, University of Manchester), antibody production
(Kontoravdi Lab, Imperial College) and theoretical net-
work analysis (Soyer Lab, University of Exeter).
We are looking for postdoctoral researcher to join this
team under the mentorship of Dr. Orkun Soyer at the
University of Exeter. The ideal candidate is a moti-
vated individual with a PhD in computational biology
(or a related ﬁeld). Experience in network analysis, dy-namic systems, FBA and object-oriented programming
is beneﬁcial but not necessary.
Scientiﬁc Beneﬁts: As part of a ambitious, innovative
and multi-lab endeavor, this project oﬀers a unique ca-
reer opportunity for the chosen candidate. S/he will
be exposed to a highly diverse set of expertise within
the team and will beneﬁt from the broader mentorship
structure which includes world-renowned senior scien-
tists. This will allow the PDRA to develop his/her
own ideas both within the context of this project and
that of the larger one. Duration and Salary: This posi-
tions is initially for one year with possible extension to
18 months. Salary will be circa 25,500. Exeter: Uni-
versity of Exeter is well positioned among the leading
research-intensive universities in the UK. The Univer-
sity is undergoing a strategic development with con-
tinuing investment in excess of 40 million. Within this
development, Systems and Synthetic Biology are recog-
nised as growth areas and there are now several leading
research groups at Exeter. Exeter oﬀers excellent stu-
dent living and the University is ranked number one in
the UK for student satisfaction. Exeter is in the south-

AbaloneGeneticDiversity
Postdoctoral positions available in the Department of
Genetics, Stellenbosch University (1 September 2010)
Two postdoctoral positions are available in the Aqua-
culture Division, Department of Genetics, Stellenbosch
University with the project title “Genetic improvement
of the abalone Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the shores of South Africa and is the only one of
the ﬁve endemic species that is commercially exploited.
Haliotis midae displays a very slow growth rate, tak-
ing two to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an
obstacle for proﬁtable farming and global competitive-
ness. In order to increase the productivity and the prof-
itability of the commercial abalone industry, a research
program has been designed which makes use of mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. Two key outputs of this program for which
two postdoctoral positions are available include: 1) The
production of a transcriptome sequence of Haliotis mi-
dae utilizing next generation sequencing technologies
including the Illumina Genome Analysis platform and
the GS FLX platform and utilizing this for amongst
others marker development. 2) The generation of com-
prehensive linkage maps and identiﬁcation of QTLs uti-
lizing microsatellite and SNP markers.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for: 1) Bioinformatic data analysis within this frame-
work. This will include developing an in-depth under-
standing of tailored genomic analytical software pack-
ages for EST, transcriptome and gene expression anal-
ysis in order to conduct research and provide post-
graduate students with bioinformatics support; keeping
abreast of new developments in the areas of bioinfor-
matics, transcriptome analysis and abalone research;102 EvolDir October 1, 2010
the maintenance of a comprehensive sample tracking
system; assisting laboratory staﬀ and students with
their research data output requirements. 2) Link-
age and QTL mapping analysis within this framework.
This will include utilizing currently available marker
and data resources as well as initializing further link-
age and QTL mapping design; providing postgraduate
students with data analysis support; keeping abreast of
new developments in the areas of linkage mapping, QTL
mapping and abalone research in general; the mainte-
nance of a comprehensive sample tracking system.
Minimum requirements: 1) PhD with specialization in
Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Genetics, Genomics or
a closely related discipline. Candidates should have a
strong computational background (DNA sequence anal-
ysis, evolutionary genetics/biology and gene expression
data analysis) and proﬁciency in relevant software pack-
ages. 2) PhD with specialization in Biotechnology, Ge-
netics, Genomics or a closely related discipline. Candi-
dates should have a strong computational background
(DNA sequence analysis, linkage mapping, QTL map-
ping) and proﬁciency in relevant software packages.
Recommended requirements: Proven experience with
SNP analyses (bioinformatic or mapping analysis).

StellenboschU Kob GeneticDiversity
Postdoctoral position available in the Department of
Genetics, Stellenbosch University (1 September 2010)
A postdoctoral position is available in the Aquaculture
Division, Department of Genetics, Stellenbosch Univer-
sity with the focus on Genetic Diversity and Population
Structure of farmed kob, Argyrosomus japonicus andArgyrosomus inodorus, and the potential genetic im-
pacts of farmed ﬁsh on associated wild ﬁsh populations.
This project is a collaborative eﬀort with Marine and
Coastal Management (Dr Brett Macey) and the Uni-
versity of Pretoria (Prof Paulette Bloomer).
Exciting new industry initiatives are presently under-
way that are exploring the culture potential of indige-
nous marine ﬁnﬁsh in South Africa. Two such species
currently under investigation are the dusky kob Argy-
rosomus japonicus and silver kob A. inodorus. The pro-
posed cage farming operations along the South African
coastline have, however, raised concerns from both the
public and conservation management authorities about
the potential genetic impacts of farmed ﬁsh on wild
populations. The current project is therefore aimed
at the identiﬁcation of populations or stocks along the
southern African coast followed by the establishment of
a broodstock management programme that can assist
in the appropriate placement of farms and hatcheries
as well as and minimize the potential negative genetic
impact of farmed animals on wild ﬁsh populations.
The successful candidate will primarily be responsible
for: 1) The development of molecular genetic markers
that enable the detection of ﬁne-scale patterns of ge-
netic variation in populations with potentially shallow
genetic sub-structure. 2) The identiﬁcation of popu-
lations/stocks of A. japonicus and A. inodorus along
the southern African coast based on species-speciﬁc mi-
crosatellites. 3) Assisting with the formulation of rec-
ommendations for kob farming along the South African
coast.
Minimum requirements: PhD with specialization in
Population and/or Evolutionary Genetics or any closely
related discipline. Candidates should have proﬁciency
in the relevant population analysis software packages
and experience with microsatellite data will be an
added advantage. The ideal candidate should also have
proven project management experience and ability to
set deadlines and meet milestones.
This position is available for 3 years and commence-
ment of duties is set for January 2011.

PhytophthoraGenomics
Postdoctoral Fellowship in ancient Phytophthora infes-
tans genomics
A two-year postdoctoral fellowship (with possibility of
extension) is available at the Centre for GeoGenetics,
Natural History Museums of Denmark, University of
Copenhagen. Funded by Lundbeckfonden (The Lund-
beck Foundation), the position will be available to com-
mence following January 1st, 2011.
Project area: The oomycete Phytophthora infestans is
one of the most destructive commercial crop pathogens.
As the causative agent of potato late blight, the most
important disease of the worlds fourth largest food crop,
conservative estimates suggest it carries an annual eco-
nomic cost of 6.7 billion USD. First observed in the US
in 1843, it rapidly spread to Europe, and within 2 years
had gained notoriety for causing the Irish potato famine
of 1845, which played a signiﬁcant eﬀect on western
history, due to the mass famine and population dis-
placement caused - an estimated 1.5 million Irish died
from starvation, and a further 1.5 million were forced
to emigrate. Phytophthora infestans exhibits a remark-
able speed of adaptation to control strategies such as
genetically resistant cultivars, and the recent appear-
ance of strains resistant to the phenylamide fungicide
metalaxyl, and the continual arisal of increasingly viru-
lent genotypes has lead it to reach epidemic proportions
globally.
Placed jointly within the Bioinformatics group headed
by Professor Anders Krogh (Institute of Biology), and
the Pathogen Paleogenomics group headed by Assoc.
Professor Tom Gilbert (Natural History Museum), the
role of the successful applicant will be twofold. Firstly,
the applicant will be expected to develop computa-
tional tools with which to assemble and analyse an-
cient genomic sequences. Secondly, the applicant will
be expected to apply these (and other tools) to genome
level sequence analysis of historic Phytophtora infestanssamples in order to reconstruct 150 years of its genomic
evolution.
Qualiﬁcations: For consideration, applicants must have
the following key skills: a) PhD in bioinformatics or a
related ﬁeld b) Demonstrated experience in the analysis
of Next Generation DNA Sequencing data (in particu-
lar Illumina platform) or genome assembly c) Ability to
program in PERL or Python, or similar d) Having pub-
lished in high-quality international peer-reviewed jour-
nals Skills of additional, although not requisite, interest
include: a) Understanding of molecular biology, evolu-
tionary biology, ancient DNA b) Ability to work with
LINUX and program in other languages (e.g. C, C++)
c) Genome sequencing centre experience d) Experience
with target-capture sequence data
As the members and collaborators of the Centre are
international, the working language of the Centre is
English, thus excellent English speaking, reading and
writing skills are required.
Application: The application must contain: Curricu-
lum vitae (incl. the applicants email address) List
of publications Motivation for applying (0.5 A4-page)
Transcript of university examinations (in English) Con-
tact details of 2 persons for references (note references
are welcome, but not explicitly needed, at time of sub-
mission)

Comparative genomics to study the emergence of eu-
caryotic pathogens
Opportunistic fungal infections, and in particular can-
didiases, have become major nosocomial infections
since the 1980’s. /C. glabrata/ now ranks as the second
cause of candidiases after /C. albicans/. It belongs to
a group which includes 3 species isolated in the envi-
ronment (ie non-pathogenic), and 3 pathogenic species.
Thus this group constitutes an excellent model for the
study of the evolution of pathogenicity in phylogeneti-
cally related species. The genome of /C. glabrata/ was
sequenced in 2004 and we have now obtained the se-
quence of the ﬁve other species’ genomes.
The aim of this post-doctoral project is thus to com-
pare the characteristics of the yeasts’ genomes in rela-
tion to their way of life and their capacity for adapta-
tion. Orthology tables will be constructed. Absent and
ampliﬁed genes, and genes subjected to positive selec-
tion pressure will be searched for. Gene maps (syn-
teny maps) will be constructed in order to test the
hypothesis of massive chromosome rearrangements in
pathogenic yeast species.
The candidate should have a strong background in
bioinformatics and genomics. He/she will work in close
partnership with O. Lespinet (IGM), and, with regards
to the positively selected genes, with G. Aguileta (CRG,Barcelona, Spain) and T. Giraud (ESE, Orsay).
The Postdoctoral position is funded for 18 months by
the R´ egion Ile-de-France (DIM Malinf). Net salary will
be around 2000EUR per month. The applicant should
have defended his/her PhD thesis no more than 5 years
before the beginning of this position, and not have al-
ready had a post-doc of 18 months or more, funded by
the R´ egion. Potential candidates should send a C.V.,
the names of three references and a letter of motivation
by email to cecile.fairhead@u-psud.fr. The deadline for
application is November 1, 2010.

UPierreMarieCurie Bioinformatics
Post-doctoral position in yeast genomics, at the Uni-
versit´ e Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) ’CNRS, 75006
Paris, FRANCE
A CNRS-funded position in bioinformatics is available
for two years, to be ﬁlled before December 2010. The
post-doctoral fellow will join an interdisciplinary labo-
ratory gathering biologists, mathematicians, physicists
and computer scientists around the unifying theme of
microorganism genomics.
This position is part of a large collaborative project
funded by the ANR, which relies on a unique combi-
nation of comparative, functional and population ge-
nomics to comprehensively describe, both at the inter-
and intra-speciﬁc levels, an entire eukaryotic clade,.
The objective is to unravel the molecular mechanisms
driving the evolution of major cellular processes such as
replication, recombination, phenotypic diversiﬁcation
and genome dynamics, through the study of a poorlyOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 109
explored monophyletic group of yeasts. This clade of-
fers an outstanding compromise between a broad evo-
lutionary range, a good conservation of genome organi-
zation and major heterogeneities in GC-content. This
unique combination associated with a remarkable ex-
perimental ﬂexibility will provide the opportunity to
decipher the molecular bases of major evolutionary
changes, both at the structural and at the functional
levels.
The post-doctoral fellow’s main project will be to ex-
plore the mechanisms of genome evolution through
the combined analysis of large data sets issued from
whole genome sequencing and resequencing data, an-
cestral genome reconstruction and genome-wide repli-
cation/recombination patterns. This work will permit
to answer long-standing questions about the interplay
between replication/recombination and the dynamics of
chromosome structure, gene birth, mutation rate and
GC-content in eukaryotic genomes.
The post-doctoral fellow should be qualiﬁed in data
analysis, programming and statistics. A good experi-
ence in genomics is required. We are looking for highly
motivated candidates who have an interest for funda-
mental biological questions related to genome evolu-
tion.

Group
A two-year postdoctoral fellowship is available imme-
diately in the Robinson lab to study molecular cytoge-
netic relationships of bovids, and African antelope in
particular. The Bovidae are noteworthy for the dom-
inance of Robertsonian (Rb) chromosomal fusions in
shaping the genomes of many species. Our recent work
on this group shows the use of these rearrangements in
determining evolutionary relationships is problematic,
and that homoplasy predominates in the chromosomal
dataset. In sharp contrast, variation in the morphol-
ogy of the X chromosome appears to hold considerable
promise for resolving some of the persistent problems
associated with the classiﬁcation of this group of mam-
mals.
We propose to: (i) Identify intrachromosomal rear-
rangements of the X chromosome using high density
BAC mapping and analysis by microdissected painting
probes and FISH. (ii) Develop high-resolution compar-
ative maps that deﬁne the borders and orientation of
rearranged segments in a species-rich taxonomic sam-
ple, and test these data for deﬁning evolutionary rela-October 1, 2010 EvolDir 111

underlying the transposition and inversion of reshuﬄed
segments.

record in the use of chromosome painting or gene map-
ping by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and
experience in using bioinformatic tools and methods of
genome analysis is required. A strong interest phyloge-
netics would be an advantage.

otic stress, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular

Fares Project title: The Impact of Genome Duplication
in the Evolutionary innovation of functional traits Brief
Project Description: It is widely accepted that genome
duplication has played a major role in the emergence
of biological diversity. This is particularly noticeable
in plants (for example in Angiosperms) where both
the emergence and persistence of genome duplication
are heavily correlated with the evolution of novel eco-
logical capabilities. Gene duplication is an important
generator of genetic variability, which is the source of
phenotypic variation. How important a mechanism is
genome duplication in the emergence of functional nov-
elties? What genome-wide changes are accompanying
the emergence of these novelties? How gene/genome
duplication synergizes with other mechanisms to facil-
itate functional innovation? In this project we will ad-
dress all these questions and other related ones follow-ing theoretical (computational) and experimental ap-
proaches. The computational approaches will be based
on the analysis of genome-wide functional divergence
after gene duplication using full genomes from organ-
isms that have undergone one or more genome dupli-
cation events during their evolution. The second com-
putational approach will consists on simulation studies
of models of gene duplication in digital organisms. The
experimental approaches will simulate in vivo duplica-
tion processes in model bacterial and yeast cells, which
will be followed by the experimental evolution of these
cells. Candidates should hold a PhD in a discipline of
life sciences (Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, etc.).
No previous experience in computer programming is re-
quired, although it is preferred. Our group is young,
enthusiastic and is experienced in several areas such as
experimental evolution, bioinformatics and evolution-
ary ecology. The candidate is also expected to have a
strong interaction with members of the group based in
Ireland (TCD). Interested candidates please contact me

cal knowledge and practical skills required to carry out
molecular evolutionary analysis on their own data, as
well as on data drawn from sequence databases. The
course will combine basic assumptions and ideas fun-
damental to the ﬁeld with discussion of cutting-edge
methodologies, and is therefore relevant to researchers
with a range of diﬀerent experience levels.
This course is essentially the same as that which was

The successes, challenges and prospects for next
generation GWAS analyses for complex diseases
15.Oct.2010 Edinburgh http://www.allpower.de/-
pages/ICSB2010.html The hopes for personalized
medicine reached new heights with increasingly
detailed SNP-arrays and aﬀordable large scale se-
quencing, however these hopes were tempered by the
relatively low predictive power for the observed disease
heritability by the resulting genome wide association
studies (GWAS). With this special topics workshop
titled The successes, challenges and prospects for next
generation GWAS analyses for complex diseases, we are
aiming to identify new statistical and computational
methods to overcome the current roadblocks in medical
genomics.
The workshop takes place in Edinburgh as part of
this years International Conference on Systems Biology
(ICSB2010) on the 15. October and features a fantas-
tic list of high proﬁle researchers from a wide range of
disciplines and institutes around the world. The work-
shop will create a productive environment, where new
collaborations are formed and new experimental setups
discussed. Please visit the workshops web page for more
details of the program and information how to register.

Phyloseminar MSalemi Sept20
Please come to a free online seminar this coming Mon-
day:
Marco Salemi speaks Monday, September 20th at 15h
PDT (3:00pm) on “Phylogenetic challenges in the retro-
viridae branch of the tree of life”
The representation of all virus families within a sin-
gle phylogenetic tree may be a misleading description
of their evolutionary history. First, it is unlikely that
all viruses originated from a unique common ancestor.
Second, viruses (retroviruses in particular) can inte-
grate into the host genome and be transmitted verti-
cally as well horizontally. Third, diﬀerent viral genera
can evolve according to dramatically diﬀerent molecularclocks. Three paradigmatic examples from the retro-
viridae family will be considered here: the simian foamy
viruses (SFVs); the primate T-lymphotropic viruses
(PTLVs), which include HTLV and STLV, and the pri-
mate lentiviruses (PLVs), which include SIV, HIV-1
and HIV-2. SFV is an example of an ancient virus that
has been co-evolving with its primate hosts over the last
30 million years. PTLVs emerged around 300 thousand
years ago and are characterized by frequent interspecies
transmissions and multiple introductions into human
populations since prehistoric times. PLVs have a much
more recent origin and only within the last 200 years
have been able to spread successfully within the human
population. The complex relationship between popu-
lation dynamics and evolutionary time-scale of these
retroviruses, as well as the challenge of their integra-
tion within the tree of life will be discussed.

Phyloseminar PLemey Sept9
Note that we ended up having a technical diﬃculty
last presentation, and this is an announcement for the
rescheduled talk.
Philippe Lemey speaks Thursday September 9 at 9am
PDT on “Phylogenetic diﬀusion models and their ap-
plications in viral epidemiology”
Emerging infectious diseases continue to appear all over
the world, and importantly, they have also risen signif-
icantly over time after. Having the potential to quickly
adapt to new hosts and environments, RNA viruses are
prime candidates to emerge as global threats to human
health. Their rapid rate of evolution, however, also
turns viral genomes into valuable resources to recon-
struct the spatial and temporal processes that are shap-
ing epidemic or endemic dynamics. In this seminar, I
will highlight recent developments in phylogenetic dif-
fusion models that tie together sequence evolution and
geographic history in a coherent statistical framework.
Both discrete and continuous phylogeographic models
have recently been implemented in a Bayesian statis-
tical approach. I will position this approach among
other popular phylogeographic methods, and then fo-
cus on applications in viral molecular epidemiology to
demonstrate their use. Finally, I will hint at future ex-
tensions that may provide entirely new opportunities116 EvolDir October 1, 2010
for phylogeographic hypothesis testing.

InstructionsOctober 1, 2010 EvolDir 117
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
