This is to inform you of two meetings hosted by the
UK-based and EPSRC-funded network MMEMS:
The ﬁrst takes place on 20-21 Jan, 2011 in Bath, Eng-
land entitled “Evolution of Microbial Cooperation”.
The second, entitled “Mathematics of Microbes: Bi-
ological Details of the Evolving Cell” takes place at
Imperial College London, 27-29 April, 2011.
Registration for the former is open now, registration for
the latter will open in January.
As can be seen from prior meetings organised by the
same group,
seehttp://www.mmems.org/index.php?id pag their
purpose is to provide a forum for researchers interested
in the application of mathematical models to phenom-
ena in evolutionary microbiology. From within-cell to
the population level, plenary speakers are drawn from
both theoretical and experimental communities and we
would be glad if you could join us in either Bath or
London.
The advertised registration fee of £60 covers local costs
associated with hosting the event.

Apr28-30
Science meeting
“Evolutionary and plastic responses of animal growth
to diﬀerent temperatures: adaptations and constraints”
will be held in Tartu, Estonia from April 28 to April
30, 2011. The meeting is organized by the European
Science Foundation research networking programme
“Thermal adaptation in ectotherms: Linking life his-
tory, physiology, behaviour and genetics”.
For further information and registration, see
http://www.ut.ee/ ˜ tiited/thermadapt/ SUMMARY:
The symposium aims to bring together evolutionary
ecologists and physiologists working on temperature-
driven a) plastic and b) evolutionary changes in 1)
growth rates and 2) body sizes of various (inverte-brate and vertebrate) ectothermic animals. Responses
to temperature is a topic in which the interplay of dif-
ferent evolutionary forces (primarily, selection and con-
straints) is particularly obvious. Interdisciplinary ef-
forts in this ﬁeld are therefore likely to contribute sub-
stantially to an improved and more integrated under-
standing of evolutionary processes. Furthermore, clar-
ifying conceptual and terminological problems would
serve the needs of both theoretical and applied research
on thermal adaptation, and beyond.

AmericanU EvolutionaryBiol
The Department of Biology at American University en-
courages applicants for our MS and MA in Biology pro-
grams.
Our faculty have a broad range of research interests
spanning genetics, evolution, and disease processes.
American University is located in northwest Washing-
ton, DC, and aﬀords students exceptional opportuni-
ties for collaboration with neighboring research insti-
tutions, such as NIH, the Smithsonian Natural History
Museum, the National Zoo, and many others. Teaching
assistantships and tuition remission are available on a
competitive basis.
Applicants should have completed a bachelor1s degree
in the biological sciences. Applications for Fall 2011
will be considered on a rolling basis, but those re-
ceived by March 1 will given priority. GRE scores are
required, and the Biology or Biochemistry, Cell and
Molecular Biology subject test are encouraged. Suc-
cessful applicants will complete a course of study and
conduct independent research. More details are avail-
able on the AU Biology Department website ( http://-
www.american.edu/cas/biology/MS-BIO.cfm ). To ap-
ply, visit AU College of Arts and Sciences Graduate Ad-
missions ( http://www.american.edu/cas/admissions/-
apply.cfm )
Featured Labs: ** Development, Genes and Diversity
The Angelini Lab is broadly interested in the develop-
mental and molecular genetic aspects of morphological
evolution (“evo-devo”). Using a combination of devel-
opmental, genetic and phylogenetic methods, we seek
to understand the roles of genes in the evolution of an-
imal diversity. Insects and other arthropods have been
our study organisms. Current projects are examining
the evolution of size regulation in the bodies and ap-
pendages of beetles and true bugs. Student-designed
projects are also possible. For more details, please visit
the lab website ( http://nw08.american.edu/˜angelini/ )
or e-mail Dr. Angelini (angelini@american.edu).
** Biology of Caves and Other Subterranean Habitats
The Culver Lab is looking for students for two projects.One is the mapping of subterranean biodiversity in the
middle Atlantic region. There are many records, often
scattered, of subterranean species, with poorly deﬁned
locations. The project involves gathering these records,
ﬁnding the best estimate of the location, mapping the
results, and making recommendations about areas to
protect. It involves using Excel and ArcGIS. The sec-
ond is on the ecology and natural history of species
living in seeps and other superﬁcial subterranean habi-
tats in the region. For more information, please contact
Dr. Culver (dculver@american.edu).

BostonU Biodiversity
Opportunities for Graduate Study in Ecology, Behav-
ior and Evolution at Boston University. The graduate
program in Ecology, Behavior and Evolution (EBE)
at Boston University invites applications from out-
standing students interested in the integrative study
of biodiversity. Graduate students in the EBE pro-
gram study a broad diversity of organisms and ecosys-
tems, and employ a wide range of methods in stud-
ies of basic and applied questions. Student research
is often highly integrative and typically includes both
laboratory and ﬁeld-based components. Our faculty
have signiﬁcant strengths in the areas of animal be-
havior, comparative genomics, ecosystem ecology, evo-
lution, molecular ecology, and tropical ecology (see
EBE website at http://www.bu.edu/biology/research/-
ecology/index.shtml ). Because of the diversity of inter-
ests represented, students are generally accepted into
the PhD program to work with a speciﬁc faculty mem-
ber. Prospective students are thus strongly encour-
aged to directly contact those professors with whom
they might like to work. Support for graduate study is
available through multiple sources, including research
assistantships, teaching assistantships, and UniversityDecember 1, 2010 EvolDir 7
fellowships. Graduate students admitted to the PhD
program are guaranteed academic year stipend support
and tuition waivers for ﬁve years.
The closing date for consideration is December
7th, 2010; exceptional students may be accepted
on a rolling basis. Direct general inquiries to

BrownU IGERT EvolutionaryBiol
Brown University and the Marine Biological Labs in
Woods Hole are accepting applications for a PhD pro-
gram in the application of next- generation sequencing
technologies to questions in ecology, evolution and en-
vironmental sciences.
This program is supported by an NSF IGERT award
and will give special consideration to applicants inter-
ested in integrating genomics, ecology and evolutionary
biology and computational biology as the foundation of
their doctoral training. Highlights of the program are
a core course in reverse ecology where natural popula-
tions at NSF LTER sites will sampled to test speciﬁc
ecological or evolutionary questions, high throughput
sequencing will be carried out to identify informative
genes and genomes, the data will be analyzed with the
latest computational tools, and the results will be pre-
sented in joint- authored manuscripts for publication.
Research themes in 1) microbial and comparative ge-
nomics, 2) adaptation to environmental gradients, and
3) computational challenges of community genomic as-
sembly will organize rotation and eventual dissertation
projects.
Details can be found at:
http://brown.edu/Research/IGERT-reverse-ecology/
Applications should be submitted online through the
Brown Graduate School web site:
http://www.brown.edu/gradschool/ Feel free to con-
tact David Rand at Brown (David Rand@brown.edu)
or Zoe Cardon at MBL (zcardon@mbl.edu) with ques-
tions.

BrownU PopGenetics adaptation
SEEKING PH.D. STUDENTS INTERESTED IN
THE POPULATION GENETICS OF ADAPTATION.
Graduate research opportunities are available at Brown
University under the supervision of Professor Daniel
Weinreich to commence September 2011.
The Weinreich lab is broadly interested in how ge-
netic novelty fuels evolution by natural selection. Us-
ing tools from computer science and mathematics we
model the evolutionary consequences of epistasis (func-
tional interactions) within the genome. This moti-
vates complementary experimental work using tech-
niques of molecular biology, microbiology and pro-
tein biology to measure patterns and causes of epis-
tasis within genes and genomes of bacteria and bac-
teriophage. This experimental work in turn drives
novel theory. Please see http://research.brown.edu/-
myresearch/Daniel Weinreichfor further details on cur-
rent work in the lab.
The ideal candidate will be intellectually curious, ma-
ture, creative and highly motivated. Comfort with
quantitative reasoning is perhaps more important than
any particular biological training or coursework.
Professor Weinreich accepts students through the
Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy ( http://www.brown.edu/Departments/EEB/-
graduate/index.htm; deadline: Dec 8), the Cen-
ter for Computational and Molecular Biology (
http://www.brown.edu/Research/CCMB/PhD.htm;

sion into wild sunﬂower. This USDA-funded project
investigates the response of crop-like traits and persis-
tence of cultivar alleles in the wild after several gen-
erations of natural selection. Students with interest
and training in quantitative genetics and evolutionary
biology are particularly encouraged to apply. Inter-
ested students should contact Dr. Jennifer Dechaine
(dechaine@cwu.edu) for more information.

ConservationGeneticsA position for a PhD student at the Graduate Center,
City University of New York is available through the
Conservation Genetics / Molecular Ecology and Evo-
lution laboratory of Eugenia Naro-Maciel, College of
Staten Island, starting Fall 2011.
Compatible candidates should be interested in investi-
gating relationships among and within species in order
to understand patterns and processes of molecular evo-
lution, and to inform conservation strategies. In this
laboratory we use a comprehensive analytical approach
to population genetics and systematics, and focus on
globally endangered sea turtles as well as other marine
animals and chelonians. This combination approach al-
lows assignment of individuals to their unknown source
populations, reveals relationships and diﬀerentiation
among groups, and explores genetic variation within
groups. This research provides unique insights into
temporal and spatial patterns of genetic variation, dis-
persal, and migration, while enhancing basic biological
knowledge of population structure and molecular evolu-
tion. By investigating population connectivity, or link-
ages among groups, and evolutionary history in endan-
gered species, this program advances understanding of
central questions in evolution and conservation biology.
To ﬁll this position the student must be accepted to
the Graduate Center (please click to see information
for prospective students: http://www.gc.cuny.edu/-
prospective students/index.htm ).
Interested students are requested to visit the
website ( http://web.me.com/enaromaciel/Naro-
Maciel Laboratory/Home.html ) then email a cv and
cover letter, including research interests and GRE
scores, to Eugenia.NaroMaciel@csi.cuny.edu
Some examples of ongoing or past research follow.
POPULATION STRUCTURE
Protected areas form the cornerstone for conservation
planning worldwide; however, protecting an area does
not automatically achieve conservation outcomes. Sea
turtles and other highly migratory organisms protected
in one area may face threats when moving to other lo-
calities. Understanding the linkages between groups
in protected areas and outside them is key to eﬀec-
tive conservation. We are therefore investigating the
population distribution of highly migratory sea turtles
throughout the worlds oceans (Naro-Maciel and Fomia
2006; Naro-Maciel et al. 2007; Caraccio et al. 2008;
Monzon-Arguello et al. 2010). Identifying migratory
connections is particularly challenging in the case of
highly migratory organisms such as sea turtles, which
spend much of their lives hidden from view moving
throughout the oceans. We are using genetic analy-December 1, 2010 EvolDir 9
sis to understand the connections between sea turtle
populations. By determining the unknown linkages be-
tween feeding grounds and other regional breeding or
feeding sites, we will better understand the range of
these turtles, identify regional management partners,
and determine conservation priorities.
DNA BARCODING
DNA barcoding is a global initiative that provides a
standardized and eﬃcient tool to catalogue and inven-
tory biodiversity, with signiﬁcant conservation applica-
tions ( http://www.barcoding.si.edu/whatis.html ). To
obtain DNA barcodes of marine turtles, we sequenced
a segment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)
gene from eighty turtles of all seven species in the At-
lantic and Paciﬁc Ocean basins. To further investigate
genetic variation, we sequenced green turtles (Chelonia
mydas) from nine additional Atlantic/Mediterranean
nesting areas and from the Eastern Paciﬁc. We estab-
lished character-based DNA barcodes for each species
using unique combinations of character states. DNA
barcoding of marine turtles is a powerful tool for species
identiﬁcation and wildlife forensics, which also provides
complementary data for conservation genetic research
(Naro-Maciel et al. 2010). The project is currently be-
ing expanded to include DNA barcodes for other threat-
ened turtles listed on the IUCN Red List of threat-
ened species, which should assist with identifying cryp-
tic species and contribute signiﬁcantly to the global
database.
EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS
Marine chelonians have inhabited the earth for over 100
million years (Hirayama, 1998). To address the linger-
ing controversies and to recover a deﬁnitive marine tur-
tle phylogeny, we sequenced ﬁve nuclear DNA markers
and two mitochondrial genes in the seven widely recog-
nized marine turtle species, the taxonomically ambigu-
ous Eastern Paciﬁc green turtle, and four outgroups.
Using this approach we tested hypotheses about the
evolutionary relationships of marine turtles, including
the placement of the geographically restricted ﬂatback
turtle, and the origin of the rare spongivorous dietary
habit of hawksbill turtles. Our phylogenetic

Position Description: A PhD position is avail-
able within the molecular genetics group ( http://-
www.eva.mpg.de/primat/ﬁles/genetics.htm ) in the Pri-
matology Department at the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.
This project, ?Genetic Analysis of Social Structure in
Hamadryas Baboons,? will use genetics to articulate
the role of kin selection in structuring hamadryas soci-
ety, with a particular focus on the core behaviors unique
to hamadryas and humans. Hamadryas baboons are
one of the few primates to share core aspects of social
structure with humans, such as a multilevel social struc-
ture, pair bonds, and female-biased dispersal, making
them a particularly relevant model species for human
social evolution. This research is part of an ongoing
collaboration with Dr. Larissa Swedell (Queens Col-
lege, New York) and will focus on a population of wild
hamadryas baboons at her ﬁeld site at Filoha, Ethiopia
(http://www.baboonsonline.org/ﬁloha/ ) that has been
the subject of observational research since 1996. Over
600 noninvasive genetic samples have been collected be-
tween 2003 and 2010, and DNA has already been suc-
cessfully extracted from them. Preliminary genotyping
was begun in the fall of 2010. The Ph.D. could be
either wholly focused on lab work or could include a
ﬁeldwork/behavioral data collection component.
This position falls within the Leipzig School of Human
Origins ( http://imprs.eva.mpg.de/start.html ), a joint
graduate program of the University of Leipzig (Ger-
many) and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology. This program provides interdisciplinary
training and research opportunities for university grad-
uates who wish to work towards a Ph.D. in anthropol-
ogy, biology, evolutionary genetics, primatology, pale-
oanthropology and related ﬁelds. Our Ph.D. program
is conducted in English, open for international students
and designed as a 3-year-program.
Qualiﬁcations/Experience: We invite applications fromall countries. Applicants must have a Bachelors degree
before the start of the program.
Candidates have to be ﬂuent in written and spoken En-
glish. German is not required but international stu-
dents will be oﬀered opportunities to take German
courses.
Salary/funding: Ph.D. students are supported by fel-
lowships which are provided either by the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology or the Univer-
sity of Leipzig.
Start Date: Available beginning in mid-January 2011,
ﬂexible start date.

Switzerland BirdEvolution
A PhD position is available at the Swiss Ornithological
Institute in Sempach to study ecological and evolution-
ary aspects of breeding dispersal in birds. The study
species will be the little owl (Athene noctua) and the16 EvolDir December 1, 2010
study area is W¨ urttemberg, Germany. This ongoing re-
search project in cooperation with the Max-Planck In-
stitute of Ornithology is funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation.
The project will investigate the individual life history
traits, ecological trade-oﬀs and evolutionary processes
shaping dispersal behaviour. These remain elusive be-
cause dispersing or unreproductive individuals are very
diﬃcult to follow. We study dispersal as the inter-
face between individual traits and fates, and the demo-
graphic processes and gene ﬂow at a meta-population
scale. The meta-population of the little owl in south-
ern Germany is an ideally suited model system for this
study. Advanced very high frequency (VHF)tracking
technology will be used to track survival and move-
ments of large samples of individuals. Emphasis is on
clarifying the eﬀects of ecological factors (such as habi-
tat structure and food availability) and life history vari-
ables (such as reproductive success, sex, age) on adult
dispersal rates and survival. Under the general hypoth-
esis that variation in habitat quality and reproductive
success will cause diﬀerential dispersal rates, experi-
ments with food supplementation will disentangle the
eﬀects of intrinsic and environmental determinants of
breeding dispersal.
We invite applications for a 3-year PhD program from
students holding a master’s degree in biology. We are
looking for a creative and highly motivated biologist
with a strong background in behavioural, population,
and evolutionary ecology and with a keen interest in
doing ﬁeld work at night, under all weather conditions
and working in a team.
Closing date for application is 26 November. The
position is envisioned to start January 1, 2011.

UBarcelona GeneNetworkEvolution
Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Department of Ge-
netics and Microbiology
We are looking for a student, preferably a biologists, to
start a PhD in systems biology and evo-devo about:
-Gene network simulation in pattern formation, mor-
phogenesis and morphological evolution.
One of the current challenges of evolutionary biology
is to understand how genetic variation leads to spe-
ciﬁc morphological variation (the genotype-phenotype
map) and how that process aﬀects the direction of mor-
phological change in evolution. Our group is devoted
to address this question by using gene network mod-
els of pattern formation and morphogenesis in embry-
onic space. The idea, developped in previous work,
is that morphological variation arises as variation in
those developmental processes and that then by under-
standing those one can understand which morphological
variation is possible in each generation. The direction
of morphological change in evolution is determined by
both which morphological variation arises and which of
this variation is ﬁltered out by natural selection. Our
goal is to understand this process by making in silico
evolution of developmental gene networks able to pro-
duce pattern formation and morphogenesis (thus mor-
phological variation). This wil l also be applied to study
the evolution and development of speciﬁc mammalian
and Drosophila organs.

UFlorida Evolution SexAllocation
Ph.D. position, University of Florida. Evolution of sex
allocation.
The Hoy and Miller labs at the University of Florida,
Gainesville, are seeking outstanding applicants for a
Ph.D. position to investigate the evolution of sex al-
location using parahaploid mites. The production of
male or female oﬀspring and the amount of resources
allocated to these oﬀspring are important life history
decisions and provide an excellent venue for studying
natural selection. Metaseiulus occidentalis is a member
of an important family of mites (Arthropoda: Chelicer-
ata: Acari: Phytoseiidae) that are eﬀective natural en-
emies of pest mites in agricultural systems around the
world. Females must mate to produce viable eggs, but
paternal chromosomes are inactivated and eliminated
during early development in embryos destined to re-
sult in haploid sons, while daughters are diploid. Work
on other mites suggests that sex allocation may be an
adaptive decision by females and may vary according
to environmental context. This work could potentially
have broad applications to both basic and applied re-
search.
The successful applicant will be co-advised by Marjorie
Hoy ( http://entnemdept.uﬂ.edu/hoy.htm ) and Chris-
tine W. Miller ( www.millerlab.net ) and will have ex-
cellent facilities to conduct this research including on-
going technical support in mite breeding. This mite is
currently being developed as a genetic model organism,
with a variety of inbred and outbred lab lines available
as well as molecular genetic tools. Transcriptome and
genome sequencing of this species is underway.
A Ph.D. student achieving a University Fellowship will
receive four years of guaranteed support, including a
competitive stipend. Teaching assistance in an intro-
ductory entomology lab for three semesters over the
four years is expected.
The University of Florida has excellent expertise in
evolutionary biology, genetics, behavior, and entomol-
ogy and has a highly collaborative atmosphere across
departments. Gainesville is a pleasant mid-sized city
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville, Florida ) innorth-central
Florida, with a wide variety of outdoor recreational op-
portunities and a vibrant cultural life. The Atlantic
and Gulf coasts are each within a 90-minute drive.
More information on the UF Entomology and Nematol-
ogy Department and Graduate Program can be found
at:http://entnemdept.uﬂ.edu/index.html . Applicants
should send a cover letter, CV, GRE scores, and an un-
oﬃcial transcript to Dr. Hoy or Dr. Miller. Promising
candidates will then be asked to submit full applica-
tions to the graduate program at UF for entry into the
program in Fall 2011.

UFlorida LifeHistoryEvolution
Are you interested in mechanisms underlying adap-

oﬀs, and sexual competitiveness? I am currently seek-
ing graduate students to join our research group at
the University of Florida (Dan Hahn’s Lab, http://-
entnemdept.uﬂ.edu/hahn/lab/ ). We take an integra-
tive approach to understanding life history plasticity
and life cycle evolution in insects that includes combin-
ing analyses of costs and beneﬁts in organismal perfor-
mance, organismal and cellular physiology, functional
genomics, and population genetics. Our two current
main projects are:
1) Using the famous apple maggot sympatric speciation
system to study how seasonal adaptation (overwinter
diapause) can drive allochronic isolation and genetic
divergence between populations. For this project we
will integrate ﬁeld collections with laboratory physiol-
ogy, functional genomics, and high-throughput popula-
tion genetics and QTL analyses to identify the genes
and physiological pathways that matter for speciation
in Rhagoletis ﬂies and their wasp parasitoids that also
appear to be diverging in parallel. This project is a col-
laboration with Jeﬀ Feder’s lab at Notre Dame ( http:/-
/federlab.nd.edu/ ) and there are angles for speciation,
cascading speciation between hosts and their parasites,
seasonal adaptation, stress biology, geographic varia-
tion, and adaptation to climate change.December 1, 2010 EvolDir 21
2) Using the Caribbean fruit ﬂy lek mating system
to study the eﬀects of oxidative stress on reproduc-
tive physiology and performance. Oxidative stress is
ubiquitous and can have serious eﬀects on male-male
competition, female choice, and life-history tradeoﬀs.
This project will include a mix of lab and ﬁeld be-
havior with lab physiology and functional genomics
(e.g., gene expression, RNAi, and transgenic overex-
pression of antioxidants in Caribﬂies and Drosophila)
and will be performed in collaboration with Chris-
tine Miller at UF ( http://www.millerlab.net/ ) and Al
Handler at USDA ( http://www.ars.usda.gov/pandp/-
people/people.htm?personid=2278 ).
Interdisciplinary training at UF could include course-
work, research, and interactions across campus includ-
ing the Department of Biology, the USDA Center for
Medical and Veterinary Entomology, the UF Genetics
Institute, various departments in the medical school,
and more. Tuition, health care, and a competitive
salary are included.
Interested students please contact Dan Hahn (da-
hahn@uﬂ.edu) right away including a copy of your re-
sume and a short statement of interests and I will be
happy to send you papers or talk more about it.

UGeneva PopulationGenetics
PhD Position in Population Genetics and Demographic
Modeling
The Laboratory of Molecular Phylogeny and Evolution
in Vertebrates, leaded by Dr. Juan Montoya-Burgos,
and the Laboratory of Anthropology, Genetics and Peo-
pling History, represented by Dr. Mathias Currat, Sec-
tion of Biology of the University of Geneva, seek for
a PhD candidate with strong interest in evolutionary
biology and good skills in population genetics and/or
demographic modeling. RESEARCH PROJECT: Bio-
diversity loss by interspeciﬁc hybridization and inva-
sive species. Current global climate changes will impact
rainfall regimes resulting in a reduction of river ﬂow, es-
pecially in small tributaries and headwaters. As a con-
sequence, freshwater organisms will have to respond bydownstream population displacements leading to new
interactions among populations and species.
This research project aims at modeling the impact of
entropic modiﬁcations on the genetic integrity of fresh-
water organisms and the evolutionary consequences.
The ﬁshes of the family Cyprinidae will be used as
model organisms as they represent most of the ﬁsh
biodiversity in European continental waters and be-
cause they are particularly subjected to interspeciﬁc
hybridization. The research program will include two
steps: (1) the development of a simple model based
on two well studied species inhabiting the river Rhˆ one
and which display natural and viable hybrids (Rutilus
rutilus X Abramis brama). This model will allow an
assessment of the eﬀects on the genetic diversity of the
predicted increase of spatial and temporal overlap of
the spawning period. (2) Then, the inﬂuence of non-
native invasive species that compete or hybridize with
local species will be added to the model.
Ideal candidates will have an M.Sc. degree in biology
with special focus on evolutionary or ecological biology
(phylogenetics, population genetics, ecological model-
ing), should be experienced in bioinformatics and/or
programming, with good skills in demographic analyses
and/or in population genetics. The position is initially
for three years. CLOSING DATE: Open until ﬁlled, but
application ﬁles, including a CV, a letter of motivation,
copies of published or in-press papers, and at least one
letter of recommendation should be received by 30 of
November 2010 to ensure full consideration. The posi-
tion will start at the earliest possible date. Candidates
should indicate in a cover letter when they could take
up the position.

jleebensmack@plantbio.uga.eduUGreifswald MyxomyceteEvolution
At the Institute of Botany and Landscape Ecology,
Greifswald, Germany, we invite applications for a
PhD position (3 years)
to work within a project funded by the Deutsche
Forschung Gemeinschaft (DFG) entitled: Reproduc-
tive systems of myxomycetes (slime moulds, amoebae):
How does evolution shape the relative proportion of sex-
ual and asexual reproduction in species that are able to
do both? We will investigate this question using the
acellular slime-moulds (Myxomycetes, Amoebozoa), a
group of common and widespread unicellular organisms
that have a sexual as well as an entirely asexual life
cycle. Both culminate with the formation of macro-
scopic fruiting bodies. Because they represent the oﬀ-
spring of two parents, the millions of spores released
from the fruiting bodies will be a tool to identify which
modes of reproduction occur in nature. We will use
cell-cycle analysis and molecular tools to investigate the
rate of sexual versus asexual reproduction in selected
species. New insights into the balance between sex-
ual and asexual reproduction, one of the fundamental
questions in biology, will be gained. Prominent pub-
lications are expected, in which the PhD student will
take part. Requirements The job will combine classi-
cal biology (ﬁeld work, microscopy, cultures), molecu-
lar work (sequencing and ﬁngerprint methods), statis-
tics and bioinformatics. You will work in a small team
(General Botany and Plant Systematics), under the su-
pervision of Prof. Martin Schnittler and Dr. Anna
Maria Fiore-Donno. We are looking for a highly mo-
tivated student interested in broad questions in evo-
lution, able to develop molecular methods, showing
initiative and able to work independently. To apply,
you must have a masters degree in biology, natural
sciences or biochemistry and have acquired some ex-
perience in molecular methods. Fluency in English is
required. We also welcome experience in bioinformat-
ics, such as knowledge of Perl/BioPerl, Linux/Ubuntu;
cultivating protists or fungi, or being familiar with
Myxomycetes. What is oﬀered Greifswald is a small
but expanding city in North-Eastern Germany, on the
Baltic Sea. The University is one of the oldest in
Germany and is steadily growing, with many facili-
ties for the ca. 13 000 students.( see http://www.uni-
greifswald.de/en.html andhttp://www.greifswald.de/-December 1, 2010 EvolDir 23
en/englisch/tourism.html ). The position is paid ac-
cording to TV-L 13, 50% (plus fringe beneﬁts like con-
tributions to health insurance).The salary should cover
cost of living and the rent for a small apartment. There
are no university fees. The contract is initially for one
year, with the possibility of an extension for up to three
years. The Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greif-
swald, an equal opportunity employer, seeks to pro-
mote careers of women and therefore explicitly encour-
ages women to apply. Qualiﬁed disabled persons are
also encouraged to apply. The position is open to can-
didates of all nationalities. Application expenses can-
not be refunded by the state of Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania. Application Please send a short letter ex-

UHongKong ClimateAdaptation
Postdoc and Graduate position Vacancies in Ecological
Demography
The University of Hong Kong is looking to recruit at
the postgraduate and postdoctoral levels with projects
which seek to understand how wildlife populations re-
spond and adapt to environmental change.
The projects will be based in the Laboratory of Wildlife
Demography, School of Biological Sciences, but will in-
volve interactions with other departments in the Fac-
ulty of Science and beyond. The projects will combine
insights from several disciplines, most notably ecology,
evolutionary biology, demography, statistics, and cli-
matology. There will be an emphasis on understand-
ing how changing climatic conditions can aﬀect wildlife
population processes. Attention will be given to the
ecological consequences of change in not just average
temperatures but also in other aspects of climate such
as inter-annual variability. The projects will involve
analysis and interpretation of long-term wildlife popu-
lation data, including data on wetland birds. More in-formation can be found at http://www.biosch.hku.hk/-
dthomson/home.html . Applicants should have good
academic track records with a relevant university de-
gree. The projects will require the ability to develop
not just an interest in ecology, but also strong ana-
lytical skills and the full range of abilities needed to
follow an interdisciplinary research project through to
fruition. Versatility and excellent communication will
be required as the projects will involve the comprehen-
sion, synthesis and presentation of ideas from quite dif-
ferent ﬁelds. The University of Hong Kong operates in
English, and language ﬂuency is a requirement.
Applications should include a CV with a statement of
academic interests and relevant experience, full aca-
demic transcripts for all qualiﬁcations, a list of any pub-
lications, and the contact details of 3 referees. Appli-
cations should be submitted by e-mail (apply-wildlife-
demography-2010@hku.hk) to Dr. David L. Thomson.
Review of applications will begin right away, continuing
until decisions have been made and recommendations
on all available positions have been passed to the re-
spective university committees for approval.
Postdoctoral appointments: funding is already avail-
able and appointments can commence as soon as possi-
ble after a formal oﬀer has been made by the university
and once the candidate has been awarded their degree
of PhD. Postdoctoral appointments will be of 1 year du-
ration with further extension being dependent on the
availability of funding.
Postgraduate appointments (funding already avail-
able): in some cases, funding has already been allocated
to these projects and appointments can commence as
soon as possible after a formal oﬀer has been made by
the university and after an appropriate undergraduate
degree has been awarded. MPhil appointments can be
completed in two years, PhD appointments can be com-
pleted in four years though this can be reduced to three
if the candidate already holds an appropriate Masters
degree.
Postgraduate appointments (funding available in com-
petition): as well as postgraduate positions for which
funding is already allocated to the above research line,
further scholarship positions are also available from the
university in open competition, and strong candidates
will receive the necessary endorsement and assistance
with that process. That endorsement should be sought
now as the applications for those scholarships need to
be submitted by 1st December for the main round.
There are further clearing rounds in May and Septem-
ber. Those appointments will normally be taken up at
the start of the coming academic year after a formal
oﬀer has been made and after award of an undergradu-24 EvolDir December 1, 2010

Some of the questions we hope to answer include: How
does the loss of sex inﬂuence genome-wide patterns of
genetic diversity within populations? Do sexually re-
producing plants exhibit faster adaptive molecular evo-
lution than asexual plants? Is asexual reproduction an
evolutionary dead-end?
Students will have the opportunity to work on an inter-
national collaboration and to learn new (second genera-
tion) sequencing technologies, bioinformatics tools, and
statistical tools for analyzing genomic sequence data.

CONSERVATION GENETICS OF PRAIRIE-
CHICKENS. A GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIP
is available for a student to pursue a Ph.D. degree
with Drs. Peter Dunn and Linda Whittingham at
the Department of Biological Sciences, University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
We are currently looking for a graduate student to
study the introgression of genes following a translo-
cation of prairie-chickens from Minnesota to Wiscon-
sin. The Wisconsin population of prairie- chickens went
through a population bottleneck during the late 1950’s
causing a decrease in genetic variation (Bellinger et al.
2003. Con. Biol. 17:717-724). Through a collaborative
project with the WI Dept. of Nat. Resources, birds
were moved to Wisconsin to restore genetic variation
that was lost during the bottleneck. This project will
determine the success of the translocation in restoring
genetic variation at neutral and functional (eg, MHC)
genes. Support during the academic year is provided by
Teaching Assistantships, and in the summer by NSF
grant support. More information about our research
and graduate studies at UWM can be found at: http:/-
/www.uwm.edu/People/pdunn/info.html .
Qualiﬁcations: B.S. in relevant ﬁeld, strong work ethic
and motivation, ability to work as part of an interdis-
ciplinary team and strong interest in conservation ge-
netics.
Interested students should send an email detailing their
interests, relevant background and GPA and GRE
scores by 15 Dec 2010 (preferably asap) to:
PETER DUNN (pdunn at uwm.edu) or LINDA WHIT-
TINGHAM (whitting at uwm.edu), Department of Bio-

UZurich MaternalEﬀectsBirds
PhD Position in Avian Evolutionary Ecology - Univer-
sity of Zurich
A 3-year PhD position on the causes and evolution-
ary consequences of prenatal maternal eﬀects in birds
is available in Barbara Tschirren’s group at the Univer-
sity of Zurich, Switzerland.
The environment a mother provides for her oﬀspring
before birth can have signiﬁcant and long-lasting conse-quences for her oﬀspring’s morphology, physiology and
behaviour later in life. Such prenatal maternal eﬀects
are therefore considered to be an important mediator of
phenotypic plasticity and a major source of variation in
evolutionary ﬁtness. Yet, we still know very little about
how the environment shapes the adaptive value of ma-
ternal eﬀects, and how maternal eﬀects inﬂuence the
evolutionary dynamics of natural populations.
In this project, we investigate how environmental vari-
ation and environmental predictability inﬂuence mater-
nal reproductive investment, as well as its consequences
for oﬀspring performance, and what role maternal ef-
fects play in the adaptation of natural populations to
environmental change.
Applicants should have a keen interest in doing ex-
perimental work with wild birds in the ﬁeld (nestbox-
breeding great tits, Parus major, will be the main
study system), and in performing molecular analyses
and physiological assays in the lab. The ideal candi-
date for this project has a background in evolutionary
ecology (or a related ﬁeld), is highly motivated, creative
and independent. A MSc (or equivalent) in biology is
required.
The successful applicant will be based at the Institute
of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of
the University of Zurich, providing ample opportuni-
ties for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary ﬁelds ( http://-
www.ieu.uzh.ch/index.html ). The groups are very in-
ternational and the working language is English. The
student will participate in the PhD program in Evo-
lutionary Biology of the University of Zurich ( http://-
www.evobio.uzh.ch/index.html ).
Zurich is a beautiful city that consistently ranks
amongst the cities with the highest quality of life.
While it oﬀers all the pleasures of living in a bigger
city, thanks to it’s central location and excellent public
transport connections, it is very easy to get out of the
city and head for the mountains for outdoor activities
such as hiking, climbing or skiing.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlining
why you want to work on this project, 2) a detailed
curriculum vitae, 3) the contact details of two academic
referees, and 4) a 1-page summary of your MSc project
or undergraduate work. Send the above as a single .pdf
ﬁle to barbara.tschirren@zooekol.lu.se
Review of applications will start on January 6 2011, but
candidates will be considered until the position is ﬁlled.
Preferred starting date is March 1 2011, but this is to
some degree negotiable. For more information, feel free

WashingtonU MicrobialSociality
David Queller and Joan Strassmann are moving to
Washington University in St. Louis and are seeking
new students interested in studying social evolution (es-
pecially microbes) in a superb graduate program. We
work primarily on cooperation and conﬂict in the so-
cial amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. This amazing
species has highly altruistic (suicidal) altruism, cheat-
ing, kin recognition and more! Compared to more stan-
dard social organisms (animals), it has the advantage
of a sequenced genome, genetic manipulability, and the
ability to do many-generation selection experiments.
This allows us to apply and test social evolution theo-
ries in new ways, and to uncover genetic mechanisms.
A major reason for our move to Wash U is the
graduate program, which is extremely ﬂexible for
both students and faculty, with programs reaching
across the Biology Department, the Medical School,
and beyond. The program in ecology and evolution
is highly ranked (#1 in one of the recent NRC
rankings). Admitted students are well supported and
graduates from the program do well on the job market.

Advice public presentation
Dear Evoldir Colleagues,
I teach the Evolution class in my department, and the
Secular Student’s Alliance on my campus has asked me
to give a presentation on evolution in January. The
presentation will be open to the public. I don’t know
what to expect with respect to whether there will be
creationists there and, of more to the point, how rabid
they will be.
I’d appreciate any advice or pointers from anyone who
has given similar public talks as to what I might expect
and what I should be prepared for.
Thanks in advance.

llarkin@paciﬁc.eduCommercial microsatellites answers
Dear EvolDir people,
Many, many thanks to all that sent information and
recommendations for my inquire about microsatellite
primers commercially designed.
I have summarized the information I received :
(1) The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in USA
was mentioned several times and it really is the best
price/product option. They use 454 sequencing fol-
lowing the enrichment step, producing a large num-
ber of primers : http://www.srel.edu/microsat/ Mi-
crosat DNA Development.html
(2) Other companies were mentioned: Genetic ID
Services, but they do not yet have 454 sequenc-
ing: http://www.genetic-id-services.com/ Microsynth
(www.microsynth.ch ) Genetic Marker Services, a mi-
crosatellite development service based in the UK
(www.geneticmarkerservices.com ). This one still has54 EvolDir December 1, 2010
elevated prices
(3) The general overview was to have 1/8 to 1/2 of a
454 plate (depending on the number of sequences-total
primers needed) done through the commercial com-
pany of choice; doing multiple species is a good idea
at not much extra cost. With the many (tousands)
of reads (sequences) obtained, one can then perform
’at home’ the identiﬁcation and design of primers using
free software (msatcommander the most recommended)
and continue with the testing of polymorphism and am-
pliﬁcation, as the cheapest way to go.
See below:
- You could have 1/4 of a plate of 454 done for each of
the species, and then use msatcommander to identify
and design primers. Macrogen has competitive prices
on pyrosequencing, but shop around as many univer-
sities have a fee for service too, and may be cheaper.
When you shop around, make sure they guarantee a
certain number of sequences, or bases, as that will give
you some indication as to how conﬁdent they are in
their service. Contact them, and talk about your prob-
lem, I am sure you can get the sequencing done for a
fraction of the 24K, and a 1/4 plate each species should
yield you enough sequences to obtain at least 10 loci (I
wouldn’t be surprised if you managed to get more).
- If you have no sequence data, you need to get that
and there will be your biggest cost. We used 1/2 of
a 454 plate using DNA from 2 individuals (1/4 plate
each) ( ~$5000 a year ago but probably less now). You
may be able to get away with 1/8 plate for each species
if you only need 10 microsats. Once you have the se-
quence data, there are free programs that will search
the sequence and identify repeats. Then, it is just a
matter of testing them in several individuals to see if
they are polymorphic. We had about a 60% success rate
so if you designed 20 primer sets, you should get at least
10 good ones. I would guess that the costs would be
closer to $7000 including the sequencing, primers, and
testing.
- We have used 454 sequencing and done the searches
and primer design ourselves, which is quite easy with
free software (msatcommander) and the searching pro-
cess for candidate microsatellites took us about a week.
The more time-consuming part is testing the primer
pairs to ensure they amplify and then screening sam-
ples of individuals to assure polymorphism, allele size
ranges, and lack of null alleles. Our initial 454-
sequencing was conducted with several individuals com-
bined in each DNA sample and and the three DNA
samples were fragmented, coded and multiplexed. The
sequencing cost was about $4100 USD and used 1/4
plate. We got approximately 250,000 reads with an av-erage length between 400 and 500 bp and from this we
were able to ﬁnd several thousand candidate di-, tri-,
and tetra-nucleotide microsatellites with forward and
reverse primers. We ordered 40 primer pairs and about
75% of them amplify and so far about one- quarter of
them microsatellites amplify in three putative species
and are polymorphic in at least two of them
- You could have 1/4 of a plate of 454 done for each of
the species, and then use msatcommander to identify
and design primers. Macrogen has competitive prices
on pyrosequencing, but shop around as many univer-
sities have a fee for service too, and may be cheaper.
When you shop around, make sure they guarantee a
certain number of sequences, or bases, as that will give
you some indication as to how conﬁdent they are in
their service. Contact them, and talk about your prob-
lem, I am sure you can get the sequencing done for a
fraction of the 24K, and a 1/4 plate each species should
yield you enough sequences to obtain at least 10 loci (I
wouldn’t be surprised if you managed to get more).
(4) Several papers were included that describe 454 se-
quencing used to develop microsatellite primers, which
are of great help!!

Drosophila hypercapnic lines
Dear Evoldir,
Available immediately to a good home or for possible
collaborative projects: 4 control and 4 hypercapnic-
evolved populations of D. melanogaster from a 40+ gen-
eration evolution experiment.
Hypercapnic populations have been housed continu-
ously (i.e. throughout their life cycle) in a mixture
of 99% air and 1% CO2, control populations under the
same conditions but in 100% air. All were derived from
a common lab-adapted and outbred stock. No previous
work has been done on these populations.
For additional details contact Howard Rundle (hrun-
dle@uottawa.ca).

Eeelbase transcriptome
Dear Evoldir member,
This message is just to let you know that Eeel-
base, the European eel transcriptome database, is
on line ( http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/eeelbase ). The
paper describing the database and the ﬁrst high-
throughput transcriptome analysis for the endangered
eel (Anguilla anguilla) has been published on Novem-
ber 16th ( http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/-
11/635 ). This is the ﬁrst result of a collaborative eﬀort-
between researchers from University of Padova, KULeu-
ven, Aarhus and Laval (now forming the virtual An-
guilla Genome Consortium or AGC).
EeelBase is freely available and will be updated 1-2
times a year, each time signiﬁcant novel data is gen-
erated. Considering the multiple factors potentially in-
volved in the decline of the European eel, including
anthropogenic factors such as pollution and human-
introduced diseases, the resources presented here will
provide a rich source of data to discover and identify
new genes, characterize gene expression, as well as for
identiﬁcation of genetic markers scattered across the
genome to be used in various applications (conserva-
tion genetics, genetic stability, functional analysis, re-
production, etc...).
We hope this new resource will be of broad use amongst
scientists. Don’t hesitate to contact us (see contacts at
the links provided) if you would need additional infor-
mation.
Sincerely,
The Anguilla Genome Consortium members

Ghana volFieldAssist BirdEvolution
* BIRD FIELD ASSISTANT, Ghana *
A volunteer is needed to study wintering ecology of Pied
ﬂycatchers in Ghana, West-Africa from 1 febr V (be-
ginning/mid) April 2011. This expedition is part of a
project of the University of Groningen within the Cli-
mate Change Ecology group of Dr. Christiaan Both in
which we study the possibilities and constraints in life-
cycle adaptation of long distance migrants to climate
change. Our study species, the Pied ﬂycatcher Ficedula
hypoleuca spends an important part of the annual cycle
on the wintering grounds in sub-Saharan Africa, like
many other Palearctic migrants. However, very little
is known about how timing of migration depends on
environmental conditions on the wintering grounds or
whether these conditions carry over to aﬀect individual
survival or performance later in life.
We seek an adventurous and enthusiastic volunteer to
complete our research team (3-4) for this winters ex-
pedition to help studying the ecology and spring de-
parture of Pied ﬂycatchers at the sub-Saharan win-
tering grounds. We plan to visit at least two (wood-
land) areas in the Savanna zone in Ghana. Field-
work will include: mist-netting, (color)banding, bio-
metric measures, blood sampling, transect bird sur-
veys, insect sampling, foraging behavior observations,
color ring reading (with binoculars & scope) and data
entry. The applicant should be willing to spend long
hours in the ﬁeld (under hot weather conditions!) and
have good social skills. Experience in handling birds,
mist-netting, ringing OR being a keen ﬁeldworker is re-56 EvolDir December 1, 2010
quired. All participants will work usually 6-7 days a
week. Although the work focuses on Pied ﬂycatchers,
many other cool (resident) bird species will be seen and
caught during the ﬁeldwork! We provide housing, ﬁeld
equipment and local transport. Volunteers must pay
own airfare and food expenses (3-4 Euros per day). A
refund of ﬂight cost might be possible (depending on
pending grant applications).

Microsatellite AlleleBining
Hi all,
I am currently working with microsatellite markers in
an invasive plant to reconstruct its history and having
problem with allele rounding of. Does anyone know
of any allele bining methods other than using softwares
like TANDEM or Optbin, and also the rationale behind
them? Thanks in advance

on microsatellite allele binning; here goes the combined
feedback, hope this helps

MSatAllele Alberto F. 2009 MsatAllele 1.0: an R pack-
age to visualize the binning of microsatellite alleles
/Journal of Heredity./ 100(3):394–397 I used it now
for severeal years. Easy to use and you get a clear
picture of most possible allele size and if alleles haveunexpected sizes (diﬀerenent sizes not consisiten with
the motif size).

There were a few methods published these
past few years: http://tinyurl.com/3aj9mac <

I’m analyzing the microsattelites for my samples with
genemapper from Applied Biosystems (I also run my
samples on a sequenzer of Applied Biosystems). There
you create allel ranges, before the program reads the
allel size and you create them by using your samples as
calibration. The programm detects where the the peks
are and asigns those ranges to allel names (or num-
bers,letters). This way, I always got integer allel sizes.
I don’t know whether this helped. Cheers, Susanne

have worked with microsatellites, mostly on salmonids,
for about 13 years. We have always run our samples on
Applied Biosystems instruments (377, 3100, 3730) and
used AB’s software to call genotypes. We struggled for
several years to resolve the binning problem. Finally
I constructed an Excel spreadsheet to do it, and I am
willing to share it with you if you would like.
Conceptually, it identiﬁes allele clusters by looking for
gaps in the distribution of electrophoretic mobilities.
We can enter a minimum gap size and it will adjust the
allele clusters to satisfy the gap requirement that we
specify. We import data by pasting-in columns from
Genemapper output ﬁles. The mechanics are accom-58 EvolDir December 1, 2010

MonkeyBible book
Evoldir:
If you haven’t seen it yet, I strongly recommend you
check out the “Monkey Bible” project, with a book
and music CD. The author’s laudable goal is to pro-
mote understanding and acceptance of evolution, even
by those “burdened” with religious belief. It is written
in a wonderful style and is focused on a half-human-
half-ape protagonist’s spiritual and intellectual journey.
The book is available via Amazon.com and has received
rave reviews from many sectors, including clerics.
Also, if you are an educator, you may want to

Phenotype Network
Dear colleagues:
We are pleased to inform you that NSF has re-
cently funded a Research Coordination Network for
researchers who are interested in searching and com-
paring phenotypes across species and in developing
the tools and methods needed in making this possi-
ble ( http://phenotypercn.org ). The representation of
morphology, behavior and other phenotypic features us-
ing computational methods such as ontologies and con-
trolled vocabularies is in its infancy. Integrating pheno-types with data across all levels of the biological hierar-
chy, however, is possible if standards are co-developed
and coordinated.
This RCN envisions building a broad base of commu-
nity knowledge and resources so as to maximize the
research potential of web-based data. Funding for par-
ticipation in meetings, presentations and laboratory ex-
changes for students, postdocs and faculty from ontol-
ogy and taxonomic domains (initially plants, arthro-
pods, and vertebrates) is available through the RCN
(see http://phenotypercn.org/opportunities/ . We
are eager to have you join us! Please sign up for
our participant and mailing lists for further informa-
tion ( http://phenotypercn.org/participants/add/ ) and
feel free to contact one of the PIs (Paula Mabee,

Software DAPC
Dear colleagues,
We have recently developed a new multivariate ap-
proach, the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Com-
ponents (DAPC), for inferring genetic clusters and de-
scribing between-groups genetic diversity. Simulations
reveal that DAPC is as accurate as STRUCTURE in
simple island models, while performing largely better in
more complex situations. The method is ﬂexible, oﬀers
unique features, and is faster than Bayesian clustering
approaches by several orders of magnitude.
DAPC is presented in the following paper: http://-
www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/94
or, for a pdf: http://www.biomedcentral.com/-
content/pdf/1471-2156-11-94.pdf The method is im-
plemented in the adegenet package for R, in the func-
tion ﬁnd.clusters and dapc. Further information, doc-
umentation and support can be found from the ade-
genet website: http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/

functional annotation of published plant genomes to-
gether with a large set of interactive tools to study
gene function and gene and genome evolution. Pre-
computed data sets cover homologous gene families,
multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, in-
traspecies whole-genome dot plots, and genomic co-
linearity between species. The Workbench provides
an eﬃcient environment to analyze user-deﬁned gene
sets^through PLAZA’s interface incl. GO enrichment
analysis for all species.
The second release of the platform integrates struc-
tural and functional annotation from 23 plants cover-
ing 11 dicots, 5 monocots, 2 (club-)mosses and 5 al-
gae (>840,000 genes). New features include: - Ex-
plore orthologous genes in other species (through the
integration of a complementary set of data types and
methodologies) - functional gene clustering based on
GO annotations - GenomeView genome browser - in-
teractive Syntenty Plots to explore local gene organi-
zation - interactive Whole-Genome Dotplot viewer to
explore gene colinearity between multiple species (on a
genome-wide scale)

Softwarer SOFSOG
Dear all,
A new software is freely available on my web page (see
below). SOFSOG is a suite of programs that helps to
design conservation or breeding plantations. The pack-
age contains three programs: Coancestry, to calculate
molecular coancestry between individuals (probability
of Identity By State or AIS); Divide, to distribute can-
didates among diﬀerent available sites (if more than
one); and Sofsog, to determine the plantation scheme
within plots to avoid inbred oﬀspring, following ei-
ther the classical neighbourhood design or the recent
method by Fern´ andez & Gonz´ alez-Mart´ ınez (Conserva-
tion Genetics 2009 10, 45 57). A more detailed descrip-
tion of the characteristics and possibilities of the soft-
ware can be found in Fern´ andez & Gonz´ alez-Mart´ ınez
(Molecular Ecology Resources 2009 10, 45 57). Advan-
tages of the new allocation method from the classical
one are that it considers all individuals in a plantation
(not only the neighbours), it includes diﬀerent pollen
dispersal kernels,
and it takes into account other sources of information
too (for example coancestry estimations between indi-
viduals).
Although specially designed for forest species, the ﬁrst
two modules (Coancestry and Divide) can be used with
any species (either, plant or animal). For example,
when we have to distribute ﬁshes into diﬀerent tanks
where they will mate randomly. Or when creating sub-
populations in diﬀerent locations within a ex situ con-
servation program.

SouthAfrica VolunteerFieldAssist
MiceEvolution
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Open positions from March 2011 onwards
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility
in the striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the
habitat is open, direct behavioral observations in the
ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are also expected to help with
maintenance of the research station (water pump, solar
power, etc.)Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 110 Euro) must be paid for accommo-
dation at the research station. For students with their
own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250 (approx.
135 Euro) per month applies. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2250 or
250 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 400 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for volunteers for the period March / April to June and
from July / August to November / December. Volun-
teers are expected to stay at least 2 months, but longer
periods of up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch.

This was my time at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-

six weeks from the beginning of July until the middle of
August I’ve been living here, studying mice, experienc-

community where there was always something to laugh
and joke about!
After arriving in Goegap, right the next morning my
scientiﬁc adventure in South Africa began: Setting and
checking traps, nest observations and radio-tracking
were our daily routine. While I got bitten by the mice
quite often in the beginning and my right middle ﬁn-

Graduate Positions and Postdoc Opportunities: Worm-
Net II: Assembling the Annelid Tree of Life
An international collaborative research team is seek-
ing graduate students and postdocs to participate in
a large-scale project on annelid phylogeny under a re-
cently awarded NSF Assembling the Tree of Life grant.
The team includes Ken Halanych and Scott Santos
(Auburn University), Damhnait McHugh (Colgate Uni-
versity), Sam James (Kansas University), Anja Schulze
(Texas A&M Galveston), Frank Anderson (South-
ern Illinois University), Christer Ersus (University of
Gothenberg), Torsten Struck (University of Osnabr1ck)
and Christoph Bleidorn (University of Leipzig). The
public summary for the project is listed below.
Potential study areas include molecular and morpholog-
ical phylogenetics, phylogenomics, bioinformatics, an-
nelid biology, taxonomy and macroevolution.
There is the possibility to work between the above lab-
oratories for cross training.
Public Summary:
The>16,000 recognized species of annelids exhibit im-
mense morphological diversity and include such distinct
groups as ﬁreworms, earthworms, bloodworms, leeches,
and many more. As sediment feeders, scavengers, and
predators, annelids occupy terrestrial and aquatic habi-
tats worldwide and are the most abundant fauna (larger
than 1 mm) in the deep sea, Earths most extensive habi-tat. Annelids have economic importance as bait, pests,
invasive species (e.g., oyster borers), and ecosystem
engineers. Nonetheless, many fundamental questions
about annelids remain unresolved because knowledge of
their diversity and evolutionary history is lacking. To
ﬁll this gap, this international project will assemble the
annelid family tree using a large-scale, multi-tiered ap-
proach. The oldest relationships will be examined with
high-throughput genomic techniques. Recent relation-
ships will be resolved with traditional DNA approaches
and a community-based sequencing service that will ex-
amine approximately 3,000 species.
As one of the few segmented phyla, annelids are integral
to the understanding of animal evolution. This project
has signiﬁcant interdisciplinary implications in ﬁelds
such as developmental biology, paleontology, marine bi-
ology, physiology, and evolution. Specimens, data, and
educational resources will be publicly available. Exten-
sive human resource development includes training >25
undergraduates, >5 graduate students and >4 postdoc-
toral researchers at four institutions, and recruitment
of underrepresented groups. K-12 outreach will foster
broad scientiﬁc participation with the general public.

EvolutionaryPhyloinformatics
RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AT THE AUS-
TRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
Three research positions are available in the Evolution-
ary Phyloinformatics Group in the Evolution, Ecology
and Genetics Division of the Research School of Bio-
logical Sciences at the Australian National University
in Canberra.
1. Exploring evolvability: its causes, consequences and
practical applications in a changing environment. Does
evolution result in traits that increase the generation
of variation or the eﬃciency of selection? Does the
tempo and mode of evolution increase in particular
times, places or lineages? The emphasis of this re-
search program is to frame questions such as these in
a way that allows them to be tested and applied to
important practical case studies. The postdoc will de-velop and extend a broad-scale comparative approach
to these questions, in particular making use of the
analysis of large molecular phylogenies and patterns of
molecular evolution. For more information see http:/-
/jobs.anu.edu.au/PositionDetail.aspx?p=3D1644 . 2.
Origins of a biodiversity hotspot ﬂora: diversiﬁcation
of the Australian Proteaceae. Mediterranean-climate
regions, such as Australiaˆ as southwest, often have spec-
tacular botanical diversity, despite poor soils and low
rainfall. Using the family Proteaceae as a case study, we
will test hypotheses to explain the origins of the richly
diverse ¨ ıof the southwest, exploring the contributions of
lineage age, diversi¨ ırate and ecological ’carrying capac-
ity’ to species richness. The postdoctoral researcher will
be responsible for generating a species-level molecular
phylogeny of the Proteaceae, constructing databases of
geographic and ecological information, then using these
to analyze patterns of macroevolution and macroecol-
ogy in the Proteaceae
3. Evolution of halophytes: a phyloinformatic ap-
proach to understanding and exploiting the traits un-
derlying salt-tolerance in plants. This project takes a
novel biodiversity-based approach to the global prob-
lem of increasing environmental salinity, by asking what
traits or preconditions underlie the evolution of salt-
tolerance across >1500 naturally salt-tolerant ﬂower-
ing plant species? We can use this as a model system
for understanding the evolution of complex traits and
adaptation to harsh environments. A research assistant
is required to undertake DNA sequencing and phyloge-
netic analysis. The position includes collaborative work
that may involve interstate travel.
If you are interested in any of these positions,
please send an email with a brief description
of your interests and experience, along with
a CV, to lindell.bromham@anu.edu.au or mar-

An NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available im-
mediately (ﬂexible start date) to work with Sean Mullen
on the comparative genomic basis of butterﬂy wing pat-
tern variation.
Butterﬂies display a massive array of color patterns,
but much of this diversity appears to be a result of
variation in the elements of a conserved wing pattern
ground plan. Consistent with this hypothesis, emerg-
ing research is revealing that the genetic basis of color
pattern mimicry is conserved, at least among closely-
related species. Current work in the lab is aimed
at identifying the genes responsible for color pattern
mimicry in Heliconius, Limenitis, and Papilio butter-
ﬂies using a novel strategy that utilizes bulk segregant
analyses paired with Illumina sequenced RAD tags, ﬁne
mapping, BAC contig sequencing, SNP discovery via
genome resequencing, and array-based SNP genotyp-
ing.
Toward this end, the lab is currently searching for a
post-doc with a strong background in evolutionary ge-
nomics and/or bioinformatics to assist with analysis of
large genomic and population genomic datasets. Signif-
icant opportunities exist for collaborative interactions
with the lab of Marcus Kronforst at Harvard University
as well as with other members of the broader Heliconius
butterﬂy community.

Dear Evoldir members,
As detailed below, a 3-year postdoctoral position in evo-
lutionary biology is available in the lab of Christophe
Pelabon in Trondheim to work on on the quantitative
gentics of allometry in close collaboration with Thomas
Hansen in Oslo and David Houle in Florida.
Sincerely,

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGY (EVOLVABILITY OF ALLOMETRY)
A 3-year postdoctoral fellowship in quantitative genet-
ics is available at the Department of Biology, Norwegian
University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trond-
heim, Norway. The position is related to the project
of Allometry, funded by the Research Council of Nor-
way. The project involves both theoretical and experi-
mental research in quantitative genetics related to the
evolvability of allometry. Morphological allometry de-
scribes the relationship between the size of body parts
and the total body size. Its evolution has recently been
questioned in a series of experimental works aiming at
changing parameters of the allometric relationship. The
project aims at testing some hypotheses by the use of
artiﬁcial selection and comparative study, but also by
developing theoretical models to explore the capacity
of allometry to evolve. The project is managed by
Christophe Pelabon at NTNU, but the Post-doc will
also work in close collaboration with Thomas F. Hansen
(Oslo University) and David Houle (Florida State Uni-
versity, USA).
Evolutionary interpretations of existing empirical re-
sults on the evolution of allometry have been hampered
by the lack of models on allometry solidly grounded intoquantitative genetics theory. The post-doc will have a
main responsibility to develop realistic biological mod-
els deﬁning the relative growth of various traits into
the quantitative genetics theory, with the aim to help
understanding evolution of allometry and replace it in
the mathematical framework of evolutionary quantita-
tive genetics. The work is a close collaboration between
NTNU and University in Oslo and the post-doc is ex-
pected to work with the teams at both institutions as
well as visiting Florida State University where part of
the empirical work is conducted.
The successful candidate should hold a relevant PhD
and have solid knowledge in evolutionary biology and
modelling, but she or he would be also able to develop
some experimental work with the diﬀerent model or-
ganisms studied in the project.
The postdoc will be formally employed by the Faculty of
Natural Sciences at the NTNU, and will become a mem-
ber of the Department of Biology. The Department
of Biology has 36 members of faculty (professors and
associate professors), 22 research scientists and about
70 PhD students and post docs. The department has
research programs in evolutionary biology, population
genetics, aquatic and terrestrial ecology, conservation
biology and biodiversity, ethology, molecular biology,
cell biology, plant and animal physiology, toxicology,
aquaculture, and marine biology. There is considerable
collaboration between the disciplines. More informa-
tion about the Department of Biology can be found at:
http://www.ntnu.edu/biology As NTNU would like to
increase the representation of females in academic po-
sitions applications from female scientists are encour-
aged.
The appointment of the postdoctoral fellow will be
made according to Norwegian guide for universities and
university colleges and to the general regulations re-
garding university employees.
The annual salary of the postdoctoral position is NOK
448.200 per year according to the government pay-scale
for university employees. There is 2% deduction for su-
perannuation.

Roscoﬀ Algal SexChromosomes
Evolution
Post-doc position on the evolution of genetic sex deter-
mination in brown algae
A one-year post-doc position is open at Roscoﬀ’s Bi-
ological Station (France) to work on the evolution of
sex chromosomes in brown algae. The project builds
upon preliminary work that has identiﬁed a 1 Mbp non-
recombining genomic region involved in sex determina-
tion in the model brown alga /Ectocarpus/ /siliculo-
sus/ (whose complete genome sequencing has been co-
ordinated by the host lab, /Cock et al. Nature 2010/).
This corresponds to the ﬁrst data on the genetic basis of
sex determination in macroalgae. The aim of the post-
doc is to explore the molecular evolution of this sex-
determination system (history of divergence between
the male and female regions, evolutionary consequences
of the loss of recombination, conservation of the system
in other brown algae). A collection of strains from /E.
siliculosus/ and closely related species is already avail-
able in the host laboratory; other strains may be col-
lected during the project. The work will involve choos-
ing and obtaining sequences of interest to explore the
evolution of this system, and bioinformatic analyses.
The work will be done in collaboration with Su-
sana Coelho and Denis Roze at Roscoﬀ’s Biological
Station ( www.sb-roscoﬀ.fr/en/genetique-algues.html <
http://www.sb-roscoﬀ.fr/en/genetique-algues.html >;

Marais at the University of Lyon ( http://lbbe.univ-
lyon1.fr/-Marais-Gabriel-.html ). Candidates should
have a PhD degree in genetics/genomics, and a strong
interest in population and/or evolutionary genetics.
Experience with /Ectocarpus/ or other algae is not re-
quired. Fluency in English is essential, as are excellent
oral and written communication skills. French is not
required, although it will help for everyday life.

FlagellumEvolutionaryDynamics
Postdoc experimental evolutionary dynamics of the
bacterial ﬂagellum
A postdoctoral position to study the evolutionary dy-
namics of the bacterial ﬂagellum is available in Huber-
tus Beaumont1s lab at the TU Delft Department of
Bionanoscience (The Netherlands).
Research in this new department employs the tools of
molecular biology, nanotechnology, experimental ecol-
ogy & evolution, biophysics and synthetic biology to
study fundamental biological questions. The Beaumont
Lab seeks insight into the mechanisms behind the cre-
ative potential of evolution by mutation and selection -
from molecules to ecology.
Evolutionary adaptation and innovation are believed to
be facilitated by the hierarchical modular architecture
of organisms. Although this notion is very well sup-
ported by comparative evidence, understanding of the
real-time evolutionary dynamics of complex phenotypes78 EvolDir December 1, 2010
is limited.
The project, which started recently, uses the bacterial
ﬂagellum as a model to quantify the evolutionary mod-
ularity of a complex phenotype and examine the evolv-
ability it aﬀords. Our approach combines experimental
evolution, directed protein evolution, microbial physi-
ology and single molecule biophysics to explore the ex-
tent to which mutation & recombination aﬀect modular
phenotypic change, and to determine the patterns of
adaptive trajectories under diﬀerent regimes of genetic
variation. The postdoctoral researcher will develop a
research line within this theme in collaboration with
the PI and with the support of a technician.
Qualiﬁed candidates have a PhD in experimental evo-
lution, microbiology, biochemistry, biophysics or a
closely related ﬁeld, and have a strong interest in the
multidisciplinary investigation of evolutionary dynam-
ics. The appointment will be for an initial period
of 1.5 years. To apply or to request additional in-
formation, please send an email to Hubertus Beau-
mont (h.j.e.beaumont@tudelft.nl). Formal applications
should include: i) a curriculum vitae, ii) a description
of why you are interested in this speciﬁc research topic,
and iii) contact information of two potential references.

Universit´ e catholique de Louvain (UCL), Belgium
Postdoc on the evolution of dispersal and life history
traits in relation to phenotypic plasticity
A two-year postdoctoral position is available at the
Biodiversity Research Centre, Earth and Life Insti-
tute, University of Louvain-la-Neuve (UCL) in Bel-
gium ( http://www.uclouvain.be/en-bdiv.html ). Focus
will be on the evolution of life styles by means of artiﬁ-
cial selection performed in lab-controlled environments.
The framework of this position is a collaborative 5-
year project by a highly active and integrated set of
three collaborating research teams, including faculty
(Profs. Hans Van Dyck, Nicolas Schtickzelle and Car-
oline Nieberding), other postdocs and PhD students.82 EvolDir December 1, 2010
The project aims for a better understanding of the role
and mechanisms of plasticity for present and future
adaptation and survival in changing environments in a
series of model organisms (Pararge aegeria & Bicyclus
anynana butterﬂies, Tetranychus urticae mite, and uni-
cellular eukaryotic ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila).
According to the model organism, life styles that can
be studied involve suits of interrelated plastic traits re-
lated to dispersal, sexual selection, kin selection... The
work will use GxE experiments to quantify the slope
and range of variation of plasticity, and will study the
functional signiﬁcance of plasticity in terms of adap-
tation and adaptability through a set of experimental
evolution experiments. Of particular interest are: (1)
the evolution of dispersal, sociality and demographic
traits in Tetrahymena thermophila; (2) the evolution
of dispersal in Tetranychus urticae; and (3) the rela-
tive role of female preference versus male display in the
evolution of sexually selected traits (sex pheromone) in
Bicyclus anynana. In addition to these lines, the suc-
cessful applicant will also have the opportunity to de-
velop additional questions related to the main research
program, and to participate in more conceptual and
review works.
We are looking for a strongly motivated candidate
with a PhD in the ﬁeld of Evolutionary Biology and
Ecology with successful experience in one or several
of these aspects: experimental evolution, quantitative
genetics, life history trade-oﬀs analysis, design and
implementation of large scale lab experiments, statis-
tics. Strong written and oral communication skills are

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER sought by the
Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at
the UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD to carry out
experimental ecological research on the ORIGIN
OF AGRICULTURE. For informal enquiries about
the job and department, contact Colin Osborne
(c.p.osborne@sheﬃeld.ac.uk or +44 114 222 0146). We
seek a highly motivated and dynamic individual tocarry out experiments examining the role of plant eco-
logical processes in the origin of agriculture. The post-
holder will work with Dr. Colin Osborne and Profes-
sor Mark Rees, as part of an interdisciplinary project
that is held jointly with colleagues in the Department
of Archaeology (Dr. Mike Charles and Professor Glynis
Jones). The project aims to develop a new ecological
model for crop domestication, integrating the roles of
environmental change, plant traits, and human agency,
under the constraints of the archaeological record. The
project has parallel experimental and archaeobotani-
cal strands that will together consolidate the evidence
necessary to develop and reﬁne this model. The post-
holder will be responsible for experiments comparing
the ecological traits of multiple plant species under a
range of glasshouse and controlled environment condi-
tions. These experiments will characterise the suite of
traits associated with seed size in the wild progenitors
of crop species, and wild grain species that were never
domesticated, using experiments that manipulate sub-
ambient CO2 levels, soil fertility, shoot defoliation, and
germination conditions. The central goal of the project
is to test the hypothesis that specialisation on a limited
range of large-seeded species, and selection for larger
seed size within these species, were both driven by an
interaction between human diet choice and ecological
processes. The project is funded by NERC and the post
has an initial ﬁxed-term of one year, with an immediate
start date of 1 January 2011. It is renewable for up to
three years in total. Further details about the position
and the university, and information about how to ap-
ply, can be found at: http://www.sheﬃeld.ac.uk/jobs .

Graduate Course New Frontiers in Microbial Ecology,90 EvolDir December 1, 2010
12-17 December, Groningen (Netherlands)
Under the auspices of the Research Schools Ecology
& Evolution (RSEE), Production Ecology & Resource
Conservation (PE&RC) and Socio-economic and Natu-
ral Sciences of the Environment (SENSE), the depart-
ment of Microbial Biology of the Centre for Ecological
& Evolutionary Studies, University of Groningen or-
ganizes a 6-day course on New Frontiers in Microbial
Ecology.
Aim:
To provide students with key insights in current devel-
opment in the area of microbial ecology.
Contents and structure Microbes are everywhere on the
globe. They were the ﬁrst to develop and will be the
ultimate survivors at the ﬁnal collapse of the solar sys-
tem. Microbes are also key drivers of a range of ecosys-
tems, from whole complex ecosystems to systems as
small as the human intestine or the skin of an insect.
The area of microbial ecology is in great turmoil, as
we are explosively enhancing our understanding of the
genomics of single organisms as well as of whole ecosys-
tems. This exciting development has opened up a pan-
dora box of new and challenging questions as to the
ecological drivers of function and evolution in the mi-
crobial world.
This course will deal with a range of topics in the area
“The implication of advanced genomics in Microbial
ecology”. Key people in the area will serve as lecturer’s
to illustrate recent highlights in their area. Moreover,
they will challenge the students with questions about
developments in their area, which will be dealt with in
(interactive) discussion sessions.
Key Topics (impact of genomics in):
- Metagenomics - Bacterial communication - Interac-
tions with hosts - Microbial diversity - function - Mi-
crobial evolution and horizontal gene transfer - Applied
microbiology
Speakers and Topics include:
Soil actinobacteria and genomics (Liz Wellington, UK)
Rhizosphere and genomics (Hans van Veen, NL)
Microbial communication in soil and rhizosphere (Ines
Mandic-Mulec, Slovenia)
Soil microbial systems - functional assessments (George
Kowalchuk, NL)
Marine microbial systems (Lucas Stal, NL)
Microbial diversity and function (Joana Salles, NL)
Metagenomics: analysis and application (Pascal Si-
monet, France)Bioinformatics (Rory Michellaind, France)
Microbial evolution (Arjan de Visser, NL)
Horizontal Gene Transfer (Dick van Elsas, NL)
The role of microbial DNA - persistence and transfor-
mation (Pascal Simonet, France)
Applied microbial ecology: The human microbiome
(Julian Marchesi, UK)
Applied Microbiology: Wastewater treatment (Gijs
Kuenen, NL)

WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGENETICS
at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, California
March 5-12, 2011
Sponsored by the
University of California, Davis and Bodega Marine Lab-
oratory
(additional ﬁnancial support provided by the Univer-
sity of Rochester)
http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/2011 Workshop In-
troduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized
modern systematics and become indispensable tools in
evolution, ecology and comparative biology, playing an
increasingly important role in analyses of biological
data at levels of organization ranging from molecules
to ecological communities. The estimation of phyloge-
netic trees is now a formalized statistical problem with
general agreement on the central issues and questions.
A nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
In March 2011, for the twelfth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-
vances in phylogenetic methodology, and then focuses
on methods and tools that can be brought to bear on
these “applied” issues in the context of a given phy-
logeny.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Lab
on the Northern California coast, which has extensive
computing resources and on-site housing. Our newly
increased bandwidth and access to computing clusters92 EvolDir December 1, 2010
allows us to utilize computer-intensive approaches even
in a one-week course. The course format will involve
equal parts of lecture, discussion, and hands-on soft-
ware training. One afternoon during the week will be
left free for ﬁeld trips to local natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Estimating, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees
* Recent advances in Bayesian and Maximum-
likelihood estimation of phylogeny
* Estimation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree
conﬂicts
* Divergence-time estimation from sequence data: re-
laxed clocks, fossil calibration
* Analysis of character evolution: maximum likelihood
and Bayesian approaches, ancestral-state estimation,
character correlation, rates of trait evolution
* Analysis of morphological form, function of complex
character systems
* Inference of diversiﬁcation rates: detecting rate shifts,
testing key innovation hypotheses
* Model speciﬁcation issues: model selection, adequacy
and uncertainty
* Diagnosing MCMC performance

Prerequisites. Students should have some familiarity
with phylogenetic methods through previous course-
work or research experience.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $600. This includes
room and board at BML for duration of the course (ar-
riving March 5, leaving March 12) and transportation
from Davis to BML.
Application Deadline. Applications are due by Decem-
ber 15, 2010. Please send a completed application
form (available at http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/-
2011 Workshop ) and one letter of recommendation
from your major advisor. Applications should be sent
via email as PDFs to pqspinks@ucdavis.edu. Sorry, but
due to the limited size of the class, postdocs and fac-
ulty are discouraged from applying. Students will be
notiﬁed via e-mail by 1 January 2011 of acceptance.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.December 1, 2010 EvolDir 93
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
