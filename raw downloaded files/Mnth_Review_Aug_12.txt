Apr12-14
CUNY Graduate Center CFP: Philosophy & Theory in
Biology Young Investigators Symposium Theorists have
long probed, and often crossed, the boundaries between
biology and philosophy through conceptual reection,
mathematical modeling, and the analysis of complex
empirical patterns.
>From Aristotle to Darwin and beyond the growthof biological theory has gone hand-in-hand with philo-
sophical inquiry into biological phenomena. The work
done at these frontiers by theoretically-minded biolo-
gists and scientically-informed philosophers is of mu-
tual benet to both disciplines.
These frontiers are often most evident in the next gen-
eration of researchers who are open to new possibilities
and aware of novel perspectives or innovative tools. We
therefore invite the emerging next generation of the-
orists to catalyze this dialogue with a symposium in
New York City, one of the nations thriving centers of
research in both biology and philosophy of biology, to
be held on April 12-14, 2013 at Lehman College, part
of the City University of New York.
Attendance is open to all, but we accept papers by
young investigators in theoretical biology or philoso-
phy of biology, dened as graduate students, postdocs,
or non-tenured faculty. Papers should be of a maximum
length of *5,000 words* (including references) and need
to be submitted at the latest by *November 25, 2012*.

Symposium: Genomic Adaptation to Ecological Niches.
12.October.2012
Invited speakers: Prof. Diethard Tautz - MPI for Evo-
lutionary Biology, Pl on. Prof. Walter Salzburger - Evo-
lutionary Biology, U. of Basel.
Hosts: Prof. Markus Pfenninger - BiK-F, Frankfurt/M.
Prof. Axel Janke - BiK-F, Frankfurt/M.
We are organizing a one-day workshop to discuss cur-
rent projects and possibly common interests in the
rapidly expanding eld of adaptive genomics of ecolog-
ical niches. Adaptation is one of the corner stones of
evolutionary and adaptation to dierent niches provides
the bridge to ecology. Rapidly falling sequencing prices
make it possible to study this process at the genome
level, triggering a methodogical revolution extending
also to non-model organisms. However, bioinformaticsAugust 1, 2012 EvolDir 5
and research strategies are becoming increasingly chal-
lenging for single groups and therefore progress may
benet from coordinated eorts.
The aim of the symposium is bringing researchers to-
gether to present and discuss current developments in
this eld, and possibly nd common strategies concern-
ing infrastructure and funding. Besides for the pre-
sentations of the invited speakers a number of short
talks will be available for presenting own research and
projects. We invite the submission of abstracts with
the registration. Attendance is free.
The symposium is organized by the project area D
(Laboratory Centre & Adaptive Genomics) of the BiK-
F centre (www.bik-f.de) and is aimed at everyone - stu-
dent to professor - interested in this rapidly expanding
eld.
The meeting starts at 9 o'clock and is planned to end
in the late afternoon (ca. 5 o'clock), with a possible
extension to discuss projects over dinner.

Madison EvoSysBio Jul30-Aug1
Dear All,
For those with an interest in interdisciplinary meetings,
here is a perfect excuse to visit beautiful Madison, Wis-
consin at short notice.
>From July 30 to Aug 1, 2012 will be the rst meeting
on Evolutionary Systems Biology with an associated
workshop on modeling languages at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison:
http://evolutionarysystemsbiology.org/meeting/2012-
Madison/ The purpose of the EvoSysBio meeting is
to explore, how to best bring together evolutionary
biology and current systems biology and what new
insights might result from this. Evolutionary systems
biology analyses critically depend on our ability to
build and analyze quantitative models of dynamicalsystems. Many important questions will require
such quantitative analyses on scales that demand
full automation. Appropriately designed problem
specic programming languages are a powerful way
for achieving such automation. The purpose of the
associated workshop on modeling languages is to
collect examples for what analyses might be desirable
and how a modeling language might look like that
could facilitate this. This is a place where you can
say what you want! This discussion will inform future
development of evolvix, a new user friendly model de-
scription language currently under development in the
Evolutionary Systems Biology Group at UW-Madison.
The meeting is free, but registration is required for
catering and other reasons. Registration will be open
until July 21 and is easy, see link on website.
Posters can be contributed until July 21 and there is
still the possibility to compete for a very small number
of talks.
We expect many exciting interdisciplinary discussions
and look forward to seeing you in Madison!
All the best, Laurence Loewe

Cooperation and the Evolution of Multicellularity Co-
ordinators: David Bensimon, Pierre Durand, Cassan-
dra Extavour, Greg Huber
Cooperation between individuals occurs throughout the
biological world. It is one of the most intriguing and
least understood phenomena despite its profound con-
sequences and its enduring impact on the history of
life. Strikingly similar patterns of cooperative behavior
appear across the hierarchies of biological structures:
genes have cooperated to form genomes, cells can be
organized into multicellular organisms, organisms into
societies, and species into ecologies. While analogies
between mechanisms of cooperation at dierent levels
of organization suggest themselves, general principles
have been dicult to pin down. The evolution of bi-
ological complexity, the premier example of which is
the origin of multicellularity, involves countless inter-
actions between individuals and the fundamental ques-
tion remains: Why and how do individuals at one level
cooperate to form increasingly more complex levels of
biological organization?
There are signs that the study of cooperation and its
evolution is entering a new period, as theoretical ad-
vances meet with advances in molecular biology, ge-
nomics and cell biology. The new tools and technolo-
gies available to observe and manipulate genes, cells,microorganisms and collectives have resulted in new ex-
perimentally tractable systems and new data to probe
classical ideas of tness, the structure of communities,
and the evolution of cooperation. To integrate these
advances, this conference brings together eminent re-
searchers in a variety of disciplines; from philosophers
and theorists, to genomicists, physicists and molecu-
lar biology empiricists. The aim is to draw on a range
of expertise revolving around the central notion of co-
operation, where we hope the interplay of theory and
experiment can provide the foundation for new collabo-
rative work in the eld. The conference is provisionally
divided broadly into 5 groupings: (i) Cooperation and
major evolutionary transitions; (ii) Origin and evolu-
tion of genomes: selsh genes, cooperative genes and
the origin of life; (iii) Co-evolution of protein inter-
actions; (iv) Mutualisms and molecules: Mitochondria
and chloroplasts; and (v) Evolution of sex/ insect soci-
eties.

PhD position: Understanding the microbial (metage-
nomic) biodiversity underpinning the release of carbon
from peatland ecosystems.
Applications are invited for a PhD studentship, fully
funded for three years by the HPC Wales/Fujitsu
collaboration (http://www.hpcwales.co.uk/) for full-
time study based in the Molecular Ecology and Fish-
eries Genetics Laboratory (http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk),
School of Biological Sciences, supervised by Dr Simon
Creer (http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/si.php) in collabora-
tion with Prof. Peter Golyshin, Prof. Chris Freeman,
Dr. Nathalie Fenner and Dr. James McDonald, to start
on the 1st October 2012.
Summary of project: Peatlands constitute the most im-
portant, long-term, terrestrial organic carbon store on
our planet. Moreover, because production rates ex-
ceed decomposition rates, peatlands in many regions
are still actively sequestering carbon, highlighting both
the historical and contemporary global ecological im-
portance of these fragile ecosystems. Thus, in their
natural waterlogged, low-oxygen state peatlands repre-
sent an unrivalled terrestrial carbon store. However, it
has been shown that under cycles of drought conditions,
the stored carbon is released as gaseous CO2 into the
atmosphere and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into
surrounding waterways, contributing to global warm-
ing, net loss of C from peatland and reduced drinking
water quality. Although it has been shown that the
microbial community underpins the cascade of events
responsible for drought-induced carbon emission, the
composition of microbial communities driving the min-
eralization of organic matter and the underlying mech-
anisms responsible for the biogeochemical cascade re-
main unknown.
Aims and objectives In this PhD programme,
we will use combinations of shotgun environ-
mental metagenomic Illumina sequencing (http://-
www.illumina.com/index.ilmn) and biogeochemical as-
says to identify links between both the taxonomic com-
position and functional diversity of the microbial com-
munities and drought-driven carbon loss from a range
of experimental peatland ecosystems.
Summary of research environment The successful appli-
cant will join the large, thriving team in the MEFGL
(http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/) within the School of Bi-
ological Sciences Molecular Ecology and Evolution
Group, one of the largest research areas within the
University. Housed within the new Environment
Centre Wales Building, the MEFGL benets from
fully equipped molecular labs and close proximity to
the Wolfson Carbon Capture Laboratory (http://-
wccl.bangor.ac.uk/index.php), second and third gen-eration sequencing capability at the Liverpool Centre
for Genome Resarch (http://www.liv.ac.uk/genomic-
research/) and access/bioinformatic development ca-
pability on the HPC Wales supercomputing genomics
gateway.
Area Bangor is located in North West Wales, situated
in an area of outstanding natural beauty between
Snowdonia National Park and the sea (http://-
www.bangor.ac.uk/bangortv/bangorandthearea.php).
International links are facilitated easily via both
Liverpool and Manchester airports.
Funding and eligibility The studentship is open to all
applicants and includes a tax-free maintenance grant of
$14k per annum, but with full-time fees paid for UK
and European residents only. International fee appli-
cants will be required to pay the dierence between the
UK/EU fee of $4,009 per annum and the international
fee of $12,800 per annum.

A fully funded PhD studentship in tropical plant ecol-
ogy and conservation genetics, ETH Zurich, Switzer-
land
Project: Demographic and genetic processes underly-
ing regeneration in coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica)
the largest seeded plant in the World
Start Date: November 1st, 2012
Summary: The endangered Seychelles palm Lodoicea
maldivica (coco de mer), is a truly remarkable plant
species, producing the largest seeds in the plant king-
dom. The nuts are traded commercially being the most
valuable in the world, with virtually all nuts harvested
for commercial use. Despite its extraordinary ecologi-
cal and economic signicance, very little is known about
the reproductive ecology and regeneration of the coco
de mer. With virtually no seed dispersal (the seeds
fall directly below the mother plant), it can be seen
as an evolutionary endpoint in a spectrum of dispersal
strategies among higher plants. This project will apply
molecular ecological methods and detailed eld ecolog-
ical surveys to investigate the role of dioecy, pollen dis-
persal and restricted seed dispersal in shaping the pat-
terns of genetic diversity, demographic structure and
tness in this extraordinary species. The results of this
study with contribute directly to the conservation and
management of coco de mer, but will also have broader
relevance to our understanding of the genetic conse-
quences of habitat fragmentation in plant species with
limited seed dispersal.
Location: ETH Zurich, Switzerland, with eldwork on
Praslin Island, Seychelles. The Primary aliation of
this project will be the Ecosystem management Group,14 EvolDir August 1, 2012

ducted in close collaboration with the Seychelles Islands
Foundation (SIF <http://www.sif.sc/ >), with local
co-supervision from Dr Frauke Fleischer-Dogley.
Requirements: Highly motivated, with a desire to work
on tropical plant ecology and conservation as part of a
dynamic team. You will have a good B.Sc and M.Sc
degree, in Ecology, Evolutionary biology, or a related
eld, with experience in experimental ecology, statis-
tics, and molecular laboratory work. Spoken and writ-
ten English required, knowledge of German and French
would be advantageous. Applicants should enjoy work-
ing in a challenging tropical eld conditions as well as

Graduate Assistantship available in Plant Evolutionary
Ecology and Conservation Biology
Description:
My lab is broadly interested in the evolution and
conservation of plants, often focusing on plant hy-
bridization and mating patterns. My research program
broadly aims to understand the evolutionary conse-
quences of global climate change, species invasions, and
species rarity. More specically, I study (1) the mech-
anisms regulating genetic diversity, phenotypic evolu-
tion, and population demography in rare and inva-
sive plants and (2) how evolutionary processes (hy-
bridization, adaptation) and properties (mating sys-
tems, genetic diversity) aect the ecological function
of plant populations (e.g., reproduction, extinction).
As such, my research touches on a variety of sub-
disciplines, including conservation biology, agricultural
ecology, and population dynamics using a combination
of eld, greenhouse, and eco-informatic approaches.
Students are expected to develop their own indepen-
dent projects but will also have opportunities to collab-
orate on funded investigations of hybridization, plant
evolution, and ecological conservation in North Ameri-
can agricultural and natural plant ecosystems.
Ryerson's Chemistry and Biology department program

UAntwerp EvolutionaryEcolBegging
The Faculty of Sciences of the University of Antwerp is

in the Department of Biology-Ethology
PhD student by the University Research Fund (BOF)
in the area of Behavioural and Evolutionary Ecology
Job description You prepare a doctoral thesis in the
eld of Behavioral Ecology. The PhD project focuses on
the evolutionary ecology of begging at the interface be-
tween mechanisms and function/evolution using avian
model species (e.g. blue tits, gulls, starlings, canaries).
Begging, the solicitation of food from parents the o-
spring, has a direct and signicant eect on growth, sur-
vival, and thus ultimately on tness. Obviously, beg-
ging for food from parents should elicit the transfer of
resources, typically a greater amount than parents are
selected to provide, since parents and ospring are, at
least in birds, not genetically identical. Furthermore,
when ospring seeks parental investment, their begging
exerts a selective pressure on the parents. But begging
is at the same time also a target of selection, because it
is inuenced by the parental response. Both behaviours
should, therefore, ultimately become co-adapted. Being
a agent and a target of selection, begging follows a com-
plex evolutionary trajectory, avoured by evolutionary
conicts of interest. Possible lines of research are: -
To test important evolutionary ecological predictions in
the context of evolutionary conicts of interest, scram-
ble competition and the honest signalling of ospring
requirement - To impose (articial) selection on begging
(a) to investigate genetic covariances and correlated re-
sponses in traits that generate trade-os or that are
co-adapted and (b) to identify underlying control mech-
anisms via a correlated selection on physiological traits
- To study the regulating role of testosterone and cor-
ticosterone, since physiological mechanisms may aect
or even constrain the response to selection by linking
the expression of dierent traits across contexts or life-
history stages - To investigate what mechanisms make
begging adaptive and thus improve our understand-
ing of the evolutionary ecology of life- history traitsAugust 1, 2012 EvolDir 17

UBasel EvolutionarySociogenomics
A fully funded PhD-position (3 years) is available at
the Department of Environmental Sciences, Univer-
sity of Basel, Switzerland. The project is on the so-ciogenomics of parent-ospring co-adaptation in insect
families using the European earwig (Forcula auric-

parental care can aect development, behavior, and t-
ness of ospring while the ospring can in turn inuence
parental care, reproduction and life-history. Such recip-
rocal feedback leads to selection for traits that reect
optimal - co-adapted - combinations of parent and o-
spring traits. The project will test this key prediction of
co-adaptation models at the level of gene expression in
earwigs, and it will combine manipulative experiments
with modern genetic technologies (RNA-Seq and gene
expression analysis)
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD-student who is
fascinated by working and thinking scientically, and
who has a keen interest in the research topic and the

UBourgogne AvianSexualSelection
*PhD PROPOSAL*
*Post-copulatory sexual selection in the houbara bus-
tard*
/A three year PhD position is available to work on a
collaborative project dealing with the post-copulatory
sexual selection in the houbara bustard./
In most animal species, females mate with multiple
males giving rise to the potential for sperm competition
and cryptic female choice. These post-copulatory com-
ponents of sexual selection add to those acting on males
to attract mates (pre-copulatory sexual selection).
Although the study of post-copulatory sexual selection
has ourished in the last decade, there are very few bi-
ological systems that are amenable to the experimental
study of sperm competition and cryptic choice.
Houbara bustards are endangered bird species living in
North Africa (/Chlamydotis undulata/), Middle East
and Central Asia (/Chlamydotis macqueeni/). In or-
der to restore and reinforce natural populations of
houbara in Middle East, the National Avian Research
Center (NARC) has promoted a captive breeding pro-
gram in Abu Dhabi (EAU) under the leadership of the
International Fund for Houbara Conservation. This
breeding program is based on the collection of sperm
which is subsequently used to articially inseminate fe-
males under standardized conditions (Saint Jalme et al.
1994). This allows investigating several aspects related
to sperm competition and cryptic choice, in a species
where both pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection is
supposed to be a strong selective force. Indeed, males
harbor extravagant sexual displays (Charg e et al. 2010,
2011; Preston et al. 2011) and females have been shown
to mate with multiple males in the wild, where the pro-portion of clutches sired by multiple fathers is fairly
high (60%) (Lesobre et al. 2010).
In the rst stage of the PhD thesis, we expect to better
characterize sperm traits that determine the likelihood
to successfully fertilize eggs. Then, experimental work
could be conducted to explore the following questions:
1)Is there a trade-o between pre- and post-copulatory
components of sexual selection?
2)Is fertilization success mostly driven by sperm com-
petition or cryptic choice?
3)Is there a scope for sexual conict in this system?
In addition to their fundamental interest, the obtained
results could also be valuable with respect to the genetic
management of the captive breeding. On one hand, in-
seminating with a mix of semen could facilitate insem-
ination procedure by reducing the time spent to select
precise pedigree and by optimizing semen utilization
(mixture of small ejaculates that are usually discarded
could be easily used). On the other hand, sperm com-
petition might result in severely biased paternity with
a potential for strong involuntary selection acting on
breeding males.
This is a collaborative project involving the NARC
(Yves Hingrat, Loic Lesobre, Tony Chalah) where all
the experimental work will be carried out and where
the successful applicant will spend most of the time,
the French CNRS in Dijon (Gabriele Sorci) and the Mu-
seum of Natural History in Paris (Michel Saint Jalme).
Interested applicants should send a CV and

Novel Routes for Environmentally Benign Control of
Agricultural Food Insects
A NERC CASE PhD studentship is available for
October 2012 start with Tracey Chapman in the
School of Biological Sciences at UEA (http:/-
/www.uea.ac.uk/bio) with CASE partner Oxitec
(http://www.oxitec.com)funded through the NERC
open CASE award scheme.
INTRODUCTION: Safeguarding world food supplies
is a grand challenge. Central to this is the need to
develop new methods for tackling pests of agricultur-
ally important crops such as the medy (Ceratitis cap-
itata). Traditional approaches include pesticides, inte-
grated pest management and biological control. How-
ever, each has serious drawbacks. In light of this there
has been increasing interest in applying genetic modi-
cation (GM) techniques for insect control, such as the
promising Release of Insects with a Dominant Lethal
(RIDL) invented by the CASE partner (Oxitec). RIDL
ecacy is expected to vary with key environmental (e.g.
food and water availability, temperature) and intrin-
sic (e.g. sex ratio, frequency of resistance) factors of
known importance encountered in the eld. The aim
of the studentship is to test hypotheses of the eect of
these key factors on control via RIDL, using laboratory,
glasshouse and eld cage experiments.
RESEARCH PROGRAMME: Eect of diet, tempera-
ture, sex ratio and resistance on the ecacy of RIDL.
The student will test in laboratory (atUEA) in glass
house (at Oxitec) and in eld cage experiments (inGreece), the predictions that (i) reductions in resource
levels (diet and water) will alter RIDL suppression, (ii)
rising temperature will elevate then decrease male sup-
pression potential, and (iii) a male biased sex ratio will
decrease control when wild type competitor males are
present. The student will also conduct novel tests for
(iv) the evolution of biochemical resistance to lethal
RIDLtransgenes. It is anticipated that the student will
spend years 1 and 3 based at UEA and year 2 based
with the CASE partner, Oxitec.
TRAINING: The studentship provides a wide-ranging,
topical and challenging project with excellent training
potential. Training in technical and generic skills will
be supported by UEA's Personal and Professional De-
velopment (PPD) programme.
FUNDING STATUS: Directly Funded Project (UK

HostParasiteInteractions
The evolutionary ecology of biological rhythms in host-
parasite interactions
http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/-
biology/postgraduate/phdproj?tags=2&cw xml=-20 EvolDir August 1, 2012
projects institute.php#SReece 7 The discovery of
biological rhythms, such as circadian rhythms, in
parasite behaviours [1] and host immune responses
[2] suggests that timing matters for how hosts and
parasites interact with each other. However, to date,
the study of parasite biological rhythms has rarely
considered whether parasites are organising their
own schedules or whether parasites are passive and
scheduled by aspects of host physiology with circadian
rhythms. Furthermore, the study of circadian immune
responses has largely occurred without involving
disease or links to parasite behaviours. This project
will bridge this divide to investigate 'what roles do
the rhythms of hosts and parasites play in disease'
and 'what are the consequences for host-parasite co-
evolution'?
Specically, the project will use an established disease
model (rodent malaria [3-5]) to link parasite and host
biological rhythms to ask the following questions: (a)
What impact do circadian rhythms in immune factors
have on protecting the host from disease? (b) How do
host rhythms inuence how successfully parasites ex-
ploit their hosts and transmit to new hosts? (c) Have
parasites evolved time-keeping mechanisms to better
exploit host resources or to evade immune killing? (d)
Do the developmental schedules of parasites inuence
the outcome of competitive interactions between co-
infecting parasites?
This project will synergise several disciplines across
biology including the systems biology of circadian
rhythms, behavioural and evolutionary ecology, evolu-
tionary immunology. The approach will begin by col-
lecting data from conducting experiments in the lab
[e.g. 1] to elucidate the daily schedules of host-parasite
interactions during infection. Depending on the stu-
dent's interests, the project could develop into focusing
on further experiments and/or could involve using com-
putational biology to undertake statistical inference of
disease processes [e.g. 6] to quantify the costs and ben-
ets of rhythms to hosts and parasites, and investigate
whether host rhythms drive the evolution of parasite
rhythms and vice-versa.

projects institute.php Genomes from nothing:
generating good genomic sequences from minute
amounts of DNA
The new generation of sequencing technologies, such
as Illumina, have revolutionised genetics and genomics.
The cost of sequencing has dropped several thousand-
fold, and large-scale sequencing is now an essential part
of many biological research programmes. There is a
movement to sequence the genomes of a wide range ofAugust 1, 2012 EvolDir 21
species in order to better understand biodiversity, to
drive eorts at control or mitigation of parasite, pest
and pathogen activity, and to better contextualise the
human genome. For many species (for example mam-
mals) obtaining large quantities of material and thus
DNA for sequencing is not an issue, or is relatively un-
problematic - one small part of a mammal yields su-
cient DNA for many genomic sequencing experiments.
However, for most species, the amount of DNA in an
individual is tiny (picogrammes) and so many individ-
uals have to be pooled to generate enough for sequenc-
ing, raising the issue of sequencing many dierent vari-
ant genomes - not a problem if the target species is
colonised or inbred, but hugely problematic if the or-
ganisms are taken from the wild. Being able to sequence
from miniscule amounts of starting materials will also
be of use to forensics, and in genomic epidemiology, as
well as in clinical genetics.
This project will investigate and develop best prac-
tice methods for the generation of de novo genome
sequences from single animals (with small genomes)
using Illumina and other technologies. By optimis-
ing whole genome amplication methods [1,2] and se-
quencing library preparation we will take miniscule
starting DNA amounts and produce good genome se-
quence. The whole genome amplication process will
introduce its own classes of errors in the data (due to
mis-amplication, chimaeric fragment production, and
others) and thus the second theme of this project will be
the development of optimal bioinformatics routines for
the identication of errors and production of highly con-
tiguous assemblies. The target species for this project
will be model (C. elegans) and new Nematoda, which
have genomes of 20-200 Mb, and are easily obtained.
These sequences will be veried by comparison to the
growing roster of completed nematode genomes gener-
ated by both 'last-generation' technology an d newer
approaches.
Ideal candidate: This project would best suit a biolo-
gist interested in both molecular biology and bioinfor-
matics. The informatics component of the project will
likely dominate. At the end of the project you will have
learnt best practice in genome analysis, programming,
use of high-performance computational resources, and
developed key technologies for genomics of neglected
organisms. You will be based in the Blaxter lab, Insti-
tute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh,
and will work closely with his team of evolutionary ge-
nomicicsts and the GenePool Genomics Facility.

Graduate position:
PhD Position in Evolutionary Genetics / Adaptive Evo-
lution
The laboratory of Molecular Phylogeny and Evolu-
tion in Vertebrates, leaded by Juan Montoya-Burgos,
Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of
Geneva, seeks for a PhD candidate with a strong inter-
est in evolutionary biology and advanced knowledge in
molecular techniques, gene expression analysis and/or
DNA-sequence analyses.
RESEARCH PROJECT:
A signicant part of the functional diversity of life
on earth is thought to have evolved through multiple
bursts of adaptive speciation. The process of adap-
tive evolution is therefore central in the eld of evolu-
tionary biology and the understanding of the genetic
mechanisms underlying the evolution of adaptive traits
remains a challenging task.
This project is aimed at investigating the evolution of
genes that are involved in adaptive responses. The can-
didate will analyze the transcriptomes established in
our laboratory to identify and characterize genes in-
volved in the evolution of adaptive traits and to de-
termine whether particular biological processes are en-
riched in positively selected genes. The candidate will
establish correlations between the emergence of pos-
itively selected mutations and particular phenotypes.
The role played by lineage-specic positively selected
genes will also be assessed, in particular by the anal-
ysis of the expression pattern of non-annotated posi-
tively selected genes. To these aims, the candidate will
participate in the development of new combinations of
state-of-the-art techniques to obtain homologous DNA
sequences of interest in a large panel of closely related
species.
We will use as model organism the Loricariinae catsh
subfamily as it is highly diversied in terms of morphol-
ogy, ecology, behavior, and in number of species.
This project is founded by a Swiss National Science
Foundation (SNSF) grant.
The Department of Genetics and Evolution hosts re-
search groups working on regulation of vertebrate devel-
opment (Denis Duboule), articial and natural evolu-August 1, 2012 EvolDir 23

ology of sensory systems in mammals (Ivan Rodriguez),
development and regeneration in Hydra (Brigitte Gal-
liot), regulation of development in Drosophila (Fran cois
Karch), sex determination and early development in
Drosophila (Daniel Pauli).
Ideal candidates will have a Ms degree in biology with
a specialization in evolution, developmental genetics,
or phylogenetics, should be experienced in laboratory
techniques (e.g. DNA, RNA extraction, PCR and RT-
PCR, DNA sequencing, cDNA library, cloning, In Situ
Hybridization), with advanced skills in DNA sequence
analysis and in gene expression analysis. The position is
initially for three years. The selected candidate will be
enrolled in the doctoral program Ecology & Evolution
(http://biologie.cuso.ch/ecologie-evolution/welcome)
CLOSING DATE: Open until lled, but all application

versity of Lausanne.
The general focus of the group is the diversity of repro-
ductive and genetic systems in animals and the prox-
imate and ultimate mechanisms underlying this diver-
sity. Particularly interesting are the factors underly-
ing transitions between genetic systems, and the pro-
posed projects will investigate causes and consequences
of transitions from sexual reproduction to (female-
producing) parthenogenesis. The students will combine
tools from cytology and molecular genetics, experimen-
tal evolution and genomics to investigate genetic and
genomic implications of transitions between sex and
parthenogenesis in one (or both) of two dierent study
systems: orthopteroid insects, mainly stick insects of
the genus Timema, and thrips. The projects are likely
to also involve a combination of eld-work and model-

PhD Position in Behavioral Ecology (f/m)
Project title
Plasticity of multimodal communication under sexual
selection in a buttery,/Bicyclus anynana/August 1, 2012 EvolDir 25
Available position
A full time four-year PhD position is available at the
Biodiversity Research Centre, Earth and Life Insti-
tute, University of Louvain-la-Neuve (UCL) in Belgium
(http://www.uclouvain.be/en-bdiv.html). Description
of the project
Individuals often show large phenotypic variation in
sexual traits (signals and preferences), which aect
their reproductive success. Phenotypic variation may
be due to their genotype, to the environment(s) in
which their phenotype is present, and to genotype-by-
environment interactions (GEIs). The impact of GEIs
on sexual selection has only recently drawn the at-
tention of researchers. The project aims at assessing
the role of GEIs on the variation observed in sexual
traits and tests whether such variation has an adap-
tive value in mate choice. An integrative approach
will allow investigating: 1) multiple phenotypic (vi-
sual, olfactory, gustatory) traits to grasp the full phe-
notype of the organism, forming its \lifestyle", and
2) the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity in both
sexual signals and preferences in both sexes. More
specically, the project will aim at identifying the ex-
tent of plastic and genetic eects in male-female in-
teractions due to signaling and preference for signals.
Methods will include behavioral, chemical and sta-
tistical analyses to test the extent with which sex-
ual signals and preference depend on individual qual-
ity, experience and on environmental conditions (e.g.[1
<#ENREF 1>,2<#ENREF 2>]). The species un-
der focus is anAfrican tropical buttery/Bicyclus any-
nana/, in which mutual mate choice and ornamen-
tation has recently been shown[3 <#ENREF 3>].
This species is a model lab-reared system for stud-
ies in phenotypic plasticity, sexual selection and multi-
modal sexual communication [4 <#ENREF 4>]. Sev-
eral sexually selected signals have recently been identi-
ed, namely male sex pheromones[5 <#ENREF 5>,6
<#ENREF 6>] and the UV-reectance of male and
female forewing eyespot centres[3 <#ENREF 3>,7
<#ENREF 7>]. We expect the results to contribute
signicantly to our understanding of the role pheno-
typic plasticity in sexual traits and other life history
traits may play population or species adaption to re-
produce in their environment.
Tasks
The successful applicant will have the opportunity to
develop various theoretical and technical skills in an
integrative manner while carrying out thescientic re-
search as detailed in the project description.She/hewill
have the opportunity to develop additional questions re-
lated to the main research project. She/he is expectedto produce several manuscripts for publication in in-

Evolution of chordate regeneration mechanisms
The cephalochordate amphioxus is the basal-most chor-
date, and as such shares many features with vertebrates
including a notochord, segmented musculature and a
hollow nerve cord. It is therefore ideally placed for un-
derstanding the evolution of vertebrate characters from
an invertebrate ancestor (Bertrand and Escriv a 2011).
It is also emerging as a good system for regeneration
studies, since it can faithfully regenerate the postanal
tail with all its complex morphology (Somorjai et al
2012).
As part of an ongoing project to understand the genetic
basis of amphioxus tail regeneration, we have generated
transcriptome data of bud-stage blastemas and normal
tails (generated by Dr Nori Satoh, OIST, Japan). The
rst goal of this project will be to analyse commonal-
ities and dierences between the two datasets. Inter-
esting candidates will then be analysed for expression
during regeneration. A long-term aim of the project
is to determine gene function using knock-down tech-
niques. This project will contribute to the regeneration
eld by developing a new model for regeneration biol-
ogy that occupies a key position for understanding the
evoluton of chordate regeneration.
This appointment is a MASTS (Marine Alliance for Sci-
ence & Technology for Scotland) studentship, and the
research will largely be conducted at the University of
St Andrews Scottish Oceans Institute (Scotland UK).
Applicants must be enthusiastic and ready to accept
the challenge of working with a new regeneration model
system, ideally with relevant experience in one or more

PhD-student position in Molecular Evolution with spe-
cialization in metagenomics
at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology Apply
no later than 2012-06-29
Starting date: September 1, 2012.
We study the molecular evolution of genomes from in-
fectious disease causing bacteria as well as symbiotic
and free-living bacteria using bioinformatic analyses of
next-generation sequencing data (NGS). The knowl-
edge is important to understand the early evolution of
life as well as the mechanisms and selective forces that
drive adaptations to dierent environments. Metage-
nomics is a new area of research in which all DNA
present in a particular environment is sequenced and
analyzed. With the aid of metagenomics it is possi-
ble to identify and study previously unknown microor-
ganisms that have not been cultivated in the labora-
tory. Another new exciting technology is single cell ge-
nomics, which enables the genomes of single cells to be
sequenced. By combining metagenomics and single cell
genomics, it is possible to perform an in-depth investi-
gation of the microora, in a way that was not possible
with conventional technologies.
The overall aim of this project is to study how bacterial
populations evolve using metagenomics and single cell
genomics. Samples will be taken from many dierent
environments, such as lakes, fossils, earth, humans and
insets. The work will be conducted in silico and consists
of bioinformatics, comparative genomics and phyloge-
neticts. Using single cell genomics, the PhD student
will reconstruct the genome from individual cells in the
environment. Metagenomic reads will be recruited to
the reconstructed genomes, with the aim of inferring
the natural sequence variation, and more specically to
compare mutation versus recombination frequencies for
dierent species and environments to better understand
the evolutionary forces that drive changes and adaptive
processes in nature.
The candidate should have a Master of Science degree
in Biology or similar qualications with specialization
in bioinformatics, molecular sequence analysis, micro-
biology or comparative genomics. Knowledge in bioin-
formatics analyses of sequence data is desirable, as is
prior research experience and high grades. The can-didate should be able to work well as part of a team
but also independently, and be procient in both writ-
ten and spoken English. In lling this position the
university aims to recruit persons who, in the com-
bined evaluation of competence, skills and documented
qualications, are judged most suitable to carry out
and develop the work-in-hand and to contribute to the
positive development of the department. Departmen-
tal work, mostly teaching, will constitute at most 20%
of the position. Information about research education
can be found at the web site of the Faculty of Science
and Technology, http://www.teknat.uu.se/cms/. Ap-
plicants must be eligible for PhD studies at Uppsala
University.
The application should include a letter describing re-
search interests and relevant experiences (maximum
one page), CV, copies of grades, exams, master project
thesis (or parts thereof) and additional documents.
Please provide contact information reference persons
and recommendation letters from prior research super-
visors.

UmeaU ForestPopulationGenomics
Ume a Plant Science Centre is looking to ll a PhD stu-
dent position in the population genomics of forest trees.
The project involves the assessment of diversity and
connectivity of spruce stands, pristine and managed,
exotic and native, through Genotyping By Sequenc-
ing (GBS) and other high-throughput approaches. The
chosen candidate will by co- advised by Stacey Lee
Thompson and Nathaniel Street, and will collaborate
broadly with numerous research groups at UPSC (e.g.
P ar Ingvarsson, Stefan Jansson, Rosario Garc a-Gil),
Skogforsk and our industrial partner Bergvik Skog.
This project utilizes the resources generated by The30 EvolDir August 1, 2012
Spruce Genome Project, ongoing here in Ume a (http:/-
/www.congenie.org/ ).
How do dierent reforestation methods impact genomic
variation within spruce stands? Clear'cut and continu-
ous cover forestry are contrasting natural resource man-
agement practices that have been broadly employed
through Sweden for hundreds of years. Although each
practice has dierent theoretical expectations for re-
sulting diversity (e.g. allelic richness, relatedness, age
structure, spatial dynamics), little is known about re-
alized patterns within the reforested spruce stands of
Sweden. This project will ll this knowledge-gap by
using high-throughput genotyping and next genera-
tion sequencing to prole genomic diversity within for-
est stands under contrasting management and silvicul-
tural practices, including the use of exotic provenances.
Comparisons will be made with pristine forest sites, as
well as with island populations of dierent ages and
sizes that have recently uplifted from the Baltic and
been colonized by spruce. Site selection will be done
in collaboration with our industrial partner, Bergvik
Skog, with additional contributions from Skogforsk.
The chosen candidate will perform top-tier research
and be exceptionally mentored as a member of the
Industrial Research School in Forest Genetics, Biotech-
nology and Breeding. http://www.upsc.se/News/-

been ranked as one of the top places in the worldfor doctoral studies. About half of our sta are
non-Swedes, and the composition of employed sta
and students at UPSC is highly dynamic, representing

a requirement. The successful applicant should possess
creativity, autonomy and a dedicated team spirit. The
working language of UPSC is English and thus high
competencies are required.
A full application consists of cover letter, your CV,
certicates from higher education, copies of Bache-

dierent countries. Researchers are organized in 17
research groups. The working atmosphere is vibrant
and enthusiastic, and CIBIO is regularly visited by
many scientists from abroad. Porto is a world-heritage
town, capital of Port wine, and the Northern region of
Portugal provides rich cultural and outdoor activities.
The Centre has fully equipped molecular laboratories
(multiple PCR rooms, automated sequencers, real-time
PCR machines, etc), as well as technicians and adminis-
trative sta, and the necessary equipment for eldwork.
Research projects are performed at a global scale. We
are now advertising two 30-months full research con-
tracts (www.eracareers.pt) primarily funded by a FP7
CAPACITIES programand expect to recruit enthusias-
tic and highly motivated researchers in the areas indi-
cated below. The positions are expected to start by
September 1st.
1. Plant Biology
A 30-months research position is available at CIBIO
(http://cibio.up.pt ), University of Porto, Portugal, in
the area of plant metal homeostasis and hyperaccumu-
lation. The candidate should have a solid research back-
ground in the analysis of physiological and molecular
mechanisms underlying metal homeostasis and accumu-
lation in plants, and it is desirable experience with both
an hyperaccumulator and non-hyperaccumulator plant
model species.
The candidate should master molecular biology tech-
niques allowing forward and reverse genetic approachesfor identication and analysis of genes of interest. Ad-
ditionally experience with genetic approaches, develop-
ment of molecular markers and use of natural vari-
ation in traits of interest (metal accumulation) will
be valued. Within this research, the candidate will
also study the regulatory and evolutionary mechanisms
of the metal/micronutrient homeostasis network, thus
previous work in this area will be considered an advan-
tage.
It is appreciated if he/she already started to build a
worldwide network of collaborators for future research
in plant metal homeostasis and hyperaccumulation.
The candidate should have a PhD in biology, plant sci-
ences or related elds, a minimum of 3 years as Post-
doc and a Curriculum vitae proving solid knowledge in
plant metal homeostasis and hyperaccumulation. The
candidate should additionally have a signicant publi-
cation record in SCI journals for the above-mentioned
topics and supervised or co-supervised academic theses
(both MSc and PhD theses). Experience in teaching in
this eld will also be considered valuable. The candi-
date is expected to build his/her own research group,
establish solid international collaborations, and be able
to attract national and international funding. The can-
didate should be a good communicator and speak and
write uent English, and will be invited to participate
in teaching at the MSc and PhD levels. The ranking of
candidates will result from a global appreciation of the
Curriculum vitae followed by a job interview. Salary
will correspond approximately to a gross annual income
of 50.000 EUR (before taxes).
2. Human Evolutionary Genetics
A 30-month research position in the eld of human
evolutionary geneticsis available at CIBIO ( http://-
cibio.up.pt ), University of Porto, in the research group
headed by Professor Jorge Rocha. The work will cover
dierent research topics related to the evolutionary his-
tory of human genes and populations. A strong focus
will be devoted to the demographic history of African
populations and to the origins and spread of adaptive
variation. A particular emphasis will be given to the
analysis of spatial patterns of genetic variation. The
candidate is expected to have an interdisciplinary atti-
tude, more oriented towards research topics and data
analysis than to lab techniques and data generation.
Accordingly, he/she is expected to have a sound knowl-
edge of population genetics theory and master dierent
kinds of data analysis software currently available to
interpret human population genetic data. Additional
computer programing skills will be considered an ad-
vantage. Applicants should havea PhD degree, a min-
imum of 3 years postdoctoral experience, and a signif-
icant publication record in SCI journals. Fluency in38 EvolDir August 1, 2012

as variance in the rate of aging among individuals, or
heritabilities of aging biomarkers. Further we aim at
outreaching to the public by informing about aging re-

Bacterial AncestralSequence
Reconstruction
Hello,
I have a genome based tree of 48 bacterial taxa us-
ing a concatenation of 52 putatively orthologous genes.
Quite a few gene tree topology diers from the genome
tree.
Now I want to reconstruct the ancestral sequences for
each of the orthologs. It needs an input of tree topologyand branch length. Since many gene tree topology are
dierent from genome tree topology, how can I choose
the topology for ancestral reconstruction?
There are two strategies here. (1) I would use the
gene tree topology and associated branch length. (2)
I would use the genome tree topology and re-estimate
the branch length for each ortholog. Which one should
I use?

Current Zoology
Dear Colleague,
The journal CURRENT ZOOLOGY is planning two
special colums for the 1st issue of 2013. One special
column is Conservation Genomics/Genetics of Amphib-
ians, and the other is Evolutionary Genomics. The
guest editors for the rst column are Dr Menghua Li
(menghua.li@ioz.ac.cn) at the Institute of Zoology, Chi-
nese Academy of Scieces and Dr. Juha Meril at Uni-
versity of Helsinki, the guest editor for the other col-
umn is Dr. Wen WANG (wwang@mail.kiz.ac.cn) at
the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. We am now inviting active scientists to con-
tribute to these special columns, and am wondering if
you, either independently, or in conjunction with your
students or colleagues, would consider contributing an
article to this upcoming special column.
The journal CURRENT ZOOLOGY (formerly Acta
Zool Sinica, founded in 1935, changed to be an English
journal and covered by SCOPUS in 2009, covered by48 EvolDir August 1, 2012
SCI and Current Contents, BIOSIS Preview beginning
from 2010, indexed by Zoological Records and Biolog-
ical Abstracts for dozens of years), is an international
journal focused on ecology, evolution and behavior.
CURRENT ZOOLOGY seeks to publish research that
explores the interface between zoological disciplines,
and is truly integrative by illuminating the greater
picture. Submissions in the research elds of ecol-
ogy, behavioral biology, biogeography, conservation bi-
ology, evolutionary biology and ecological/evolutionary
genomics are especially welcome. International contrib-
utors accounted for 83% of the annual total authorship
in 2010 and 76% in 2011.
It is a longstanding commitment for the journal to pub-
lish Special Columns. A special column typically in-
clude three to eight peer-reviewed papers on the same
theme. We encourage proposals for Special Columns
on topics that reect the current trends and hot stud-
ies in related research elds. All the manuscripts sub-
mitted to special columns are subject to peer review.
Authors are not charged for paper handling and publi-
cation including color pages; the papers will be put on-
line immediately after the papers have been accepted.
Published papers can be read and downloaded free of
charge. Previous special columns/issues and their links
are attached below.
I^All await your reply as to whether you see yourself
contributing a paper. Beow is the time schedule for the
special columns:
Deadline for manuscript submission: Oct 20,2012; End
of manuscript reviewing and revision:Dec. 20, 2012;
Dec 21-Jan 10,2013: paper nalizing Jan. 11-Feb. 20:
typesetting, proof reading and correction, paper online;
Feb. 20, 2013: paper printing.
You may send your manuscript now or by deadline.
Manuscripts should be submitted to the special
column via ScholarOne ManuscriptsTM http://-

Distance between protein sequences
Dear Evoldir Members,
I would like to calculate distances (distance matrix)
between protein sequences using my own predened
aminoacid substitution matrix. Do you know a soft-
ware that allows this? The phylip protdist may allow
it but I was not able to nd a description about the
format of the substitution matrix.
Thanks for the suggestions!

Drosophila transpositionsDrosophila
transpositions
Dear Evo-Devo community,
I am working with Drosophila melanogaster and I would
like to have an easy read-out for transposition events in
the germline.
I was thinking about using a line that has a transposon
inserted in the gene white so that frequency of trans-
position is >or = to frequency of red eyed ies in the
next generation. For this purpose I was planning to use
the wDZL stock but it had lost the transposon.
Can anyone help me with a stock or an idea to solve
the problem?!
Thank you very much in advance!
All the very best

*For immediate release*
*Oxford University Press launches /Evolution,
Medicine, and Public Health/*
Oxford University Press (OUP) and the Evolution,
Medicine, and Public Health Foundation are pleased to
announce the launch of the open access journal /Evo-
lution, Medicine, and Public Health/ (EMPH).
EMPH//publishes original, rigorous applications of
evolutionary biology to problems in medicine and pub-
lic health, and research that advances basic evolution-
ary biology by studying issues that arise in the medical
sciences. Knowledge will ow in both directions, with
emphasis on work with the potential to reduce suering
and save lives. Because evolutionary biology is a basic
science that reaches across many disciplines, EMPH is
open to contributions on a broad range of topics.
The President of the Foundation, Randolph Nesse, <
http://nesse.us >said: \Evolutionary biology is a sci-ence whose applications in medicine and public health
are nally being recognized. Articles published in
EMPH will bring new recognition to these applications
and to studies of disease that advance basic science.
The Foundation is grateful to the distinguished evo-
lutionary biologistProfessor Stephen Stearns <http:/-
/www.yale.edu/eeb/stearns/ >of Yale University for
agreeing to lead the journal as Editor-in Chief. He
has recruited eighty-nine of the most respected schol-
ars in their elds to serve as Associate Editors; they
include, as Senior Editors, David Haig (Harvard Uni-
versity), Carlo Maley (University of California, San
Francisco), Angela McLean (University of Oxford), An-
drew Read (Pennsylvania State University), and Gre-
gory Wray (Duke University). The Foundation looks
forward to working with Oxford University Press and
appreciates its willingness to make EMPH fully open
access and to provide for publication by authors with
limited funding. The launch of EMPH marks the com-
ing of age of evolutionary medicine. Its content will
transform our understanding of the body and disease
in ways that improve human health."
Cathy Kennedy, Senior Publisher, Life Sciences, at
OUP said: \We are extremely proud and excited to
announce the EMPH launch. We see the new journal
as a great tool to promote dialogue between the disci-
plines of evolutionary biology and medicine, acting as a
catalyst for research that will make a serious impact on
humankind. Professor Stearns has gathered together a
rst-class team of editors who will help to ensure that
the new journal is of the very highest quality."
/The rst papers in //Evolution, Medicine, and Public
Health//will be published by OUP in late 2012. /The
journal is now open for contributions on a broad range
of topics and is designed to be of interest and accessible
across a broad spectrum of biological and medical disci-
plines. No author's fees will apply in the rst year, and
arrangements are in place for on-going publication of ar-
ticles by authors with limited funding. /Visit the web-

Genome amplication kits
I am looking for a whole genome amplication kit to
basically \make more" DNA from quantities extracted
from small amounts of starting material (small insect
legs and buttery wing fragments). I am using the DNA
for genotyping purposes and have had issues of running
out of template before I can amplify all of my microsat
loci (which happens even with extensive multiplexing).
Commercial kits have recently gone up in price (the il-
lustra GenomiPhi V2 kit now costs $491 USD for 100

MarineConservation volunteers
Volunteer Divers wanted -Marine Protected Areas
(Philippines), for Sept/Oct or March/April
Project Seahorse and its NGO partner in the Philip-
pines are seeking volunteer, certied SCUBA divers
(minimum 15 logged dives) who are interested in partic-
ipating in a long-term monitoring program for marine
protected areas (MPAs) in northern Bohol, Philippines.
The surveys are conducted biannually, one in the
dry season (March/April) and one in the wet season
(Sept/Oct). An eight-week commitment is required
comprising approximately two weeks of training and
six weeks of survey work. Surveys are easily inuenced
by weather and other unpredictable events, so the du-
ration of the eldwork may vary. If completed quickly,
volunteers will be asked to assist with other conserva-
tion work, such as data encoding or assisting with other
biological eld programs.
For applications visit the following - note the deadline
for Sept/Oct has been extended to July 15th:
http://seahorse.sheries.ubc.ca/node/315 ADDI-
TIONAL INFO:
Diving Survey Work
In the dry season, sites are surveyed for sh communi-
ties and seahorses. In the wet season, benthic communi-
ties, coral complexity and seahorses are censused. Div-
ing will involve shallow dives, generally 3-10 m, rarely52 EvolDir August 1, 2012
to a maximum of 14 m, both during the day (benthic,
coral and sh surveys) and during the night (seahorse
surveys). Photography is used in the benthic surveys;
although benecial, no prior experience with underwa-
ter photography is required. We will select 3-4 interna-
tional volunteers for each survey.
Requirements for volunteering
The Project Seahorse Foundation requires a donation
of $2700 USD to help cover survey costs, local travel,
accommodation, and food. Volunteers must also pro-
vide their own SCUBA gear and are responsible for
the cost of their return airfare to the Philippines, visa
costs, travel/health insurance and appropriate vaccina-
tions, together with providing proof of a current dive
medical and dive insurance.
A working knowledge of coral reef sh families and ben-
thic fauna (esp. corals) and ora would be an advan-
tage.
Volunteers will be supervised by the Project Seahorse
Foundation Survey Biologist and based in Handumon
(Jandayan Island). On arrival in Cebu City, the Project
Seahorse Foundation sta will organize a comprehen-
sive orientation on its programs and projects, MPA
survey schedule, safety protocols, and community and
team living.
Application timeline
Interviews will be conducted in the last week of June
2012 by phone.
Payment of donation: 50% of the required donation
should be paid after selected applicants have been noti-
ed, and the remaining 50% at start of the programme.

Background information
Long-term monitoring of Marine Protected Areas
In 1998, Project Seahorse initiated the long term mon-
itoring programme for assessing MPA eectiveness innorthern Bohol. The motivation behind the programme
is three-fold:
(1) to provide up-to-date monitoring data to inform
shing communities about the status of their reefs, (2)
to catalyze community interest in managing and estab-
lishing additional MPAs, and (3) to provide scienti-
cally robust data for assessing the impact on MPAs on
the recovery of coral reefs.
Trial surveys were conducted in the late 1990s, and the
full design of the programme was established in 2001.
Over the past decade, over 70 international volunteers
have participated in the programme, and it is with their
hard work and commitment that we continue to meet
our objective of quantifying the response of seahorses,
shes and benthic organisms (e.g. live coral) to protec-
tion.
Currently a total of seven MPAs are being monitored,
each with a control site situated just outside the MPA.
In addition, four more distant control sites have also
been selected (see table). The MPAs are located in
four municipalities in Bohol.

NERC studentships
*Prestigious NERC funded studentship. Genetic pedi-
grees and individual trait variability:Ecological and
evolutionary consequences for wild sh populations.*
Recent advances in genetic data analysis have provided
the tools so that evolutionary processes in wild popu-
lations can be inferred from molecular data. Molecular
based pedigrees can be used to estimate reproductive
success of individuals or phenotypes and for quantita-
tive genetic analysis. The resulting information on her-
itability of ecologically signicant life history traits or
behaviours is crucial in accurately predicting responses
to selection and is therefore a key element of evolution-
ary models. Here we will use sophisticated maximum-
likelihood and Bayesian approaches for parentage anal-
ysis (e.g. molecular pedigree reconstruction) to produce
eld based heritability estimates. Important aspects of
population structure such as geographic or behavioural
barriers to migration to gene ow between subpopula-
tions and the eective population size, can be inferred
from these molecular data and as such provide both a
framework for understanding micro-evolutionary pro-
cesses and key information for the validation of evolu-August 1, 2012 EvolDir 53
tionary models.
In this PhD, we will use a riverine pike Esox lucius
population from the River Frome as a model for our
predictions. The River Frome is a chalk stream with
a total length of approximately 15km where pike are
present. Since no freshwater connections exist to other
river catchments it constitutes a closed system regard-
ing non-migratory freshwater sh populations. The
core investigation area covers approximately 4km of
river length (33% of the available pike habitat) includ-
ing seven discrete spawning sites. Data on growth, diet
and sampling location are available for a large propor-
tion of E. Lucius, whose population has been studied
on the river since 1976. These data have enabled quan-
titative measures to be made of population changes in
terms of abundance, age structure, mortality, individ-
ual growth and diet, but a collection of tissue material
also provide the opportunity to obtain genetic data and
link them on individual life-history traits, providing an
important temporal component for the project.

Software SBEToolbox54 EvolDir August 1, 2012
Dear all,
We present SBEToolbox (Systems Biology and Evo-
lution Toolbox), an open-source Matlab toolbox for
biological network analysis. It calculates a variety
of centralities and topological metrics, clusters nodes
into modules, and interactively displays the network
using dierent graph layout algorithms. Ecient
lightweight design allows large-scale networks to be
handled. Straightforward implementation and the in-
clusion of high-level functions allow the functionality to
be easily extended or tailored. SBEGUI, a menu-driven
GUI of SBEToolbox, is highly interactive, enabling easy
usage of most network and graph algorithms without
prior knowledge of programming. The stand-alone ex-
ecutable SBEGUI, running on all major operating sys-
tems, does not require the installation of Matlab sys-
tem. Availability: Pre-compiled stand-alone executable
for all major operating systems and source code are
freely available at http://sbetoolbox.sourceforge.net .
Your comments are always welcome.

CharlesU ReptileSexDetermination
Evolution of sex determination and sex chromosomes
in squamate reptiles
Reptiles possess variability in sex determining systems
ranging from environmental sex determination, where
sex chromosomes are not present, to well-dierentiated
XY or ZW sex chromosomes. This variability is partic-
ularly substantial in squamate reptiles, the group en-
compassing lizards and snakes. Study of the processes
responsible for variability in sex determination in some
squamate lineages versus conservatism in others, as well
as the possibility of comparison of genome organization
in closely related lineages or species with and without
sex chromosomes, may allow signicant contribution to
the evolution of sex determination and dierentiation
in vertebrates as well as our understanding of sexual de-
velopment in general. The aim of the project is to test
homology of sex chromosomes across major lineages of
squamate reptiles to uncover the phylogeny of sex de-
termining modes in this group and to determine rates
of sex chromosome dierentiation within particular se-
lected groups. The project is based on the techniques of
molecular cytogenetics including cell cultivation, FISH,
chromosome laser microdissection and ow sorting, and
single gene mapping and various kinds of molecular ap-
proaches. The work will be done in the laboratories
in Prague (Charles University) and Libechov (Czech
Academy of Science), Czech Republic. The prospective
candidate should have experience in molecular genetics
and cytogenetics, evolutionary genetics and genomics.
Demonstrated expertise in molecular cytogenetics mas-
tering at least some of the above mentioned techniques
is essential.The position is funded through the internal grant of the
Charles University in Prague. The position is available
from 1 January 2013 for up to two years. To apply,
please send a CV including the list of publications, re-
search statement and contacts of two previous super-
visors/colleagues willing to write a reference. The call
will be open until 20 August 2012. Shortlisted candi-
dates will be interviewed during the last August week.
The nal decision will be made in October.

EmoryU FlagellaEvolution
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW POSITION, EMORY
UNIVERSITY
A postdoctoral fellow position is available in the Wright
laboratory at Emory University starting fall/winter
2012 (http://electronmicroscopy.emory.edu). Research
in the lab is focused on bacterial and viral structural
biology, with emphasis on 3-D structure/function rela-
tionships between host cells and viruses. Areas of inter-
est include cryo-electron tomography of bacteria, bacte-
ria ' bacteriophage interactions, paramyxoviruses, and
HIV-1. Technology development interests are in the
areas of correlative microscopy and phase plate cryo-
microscopy.
The postdoctoral position is to study the structure of
agella and type IV pili from several bacterial species
and correlate the structural information with environ-
mental and biodiversity patterns. The long-term goal
of the project is to understand 1) the structural impli-
cations of the incorporation of multiple agellins into
the agellar lament and 2) the structural variation
between T4bP and Flp-type pili at the macromolecu-
lar level. The main rationale is that the architectural
complexity of agella and pili (critical virulence factors
for many bacterial species) is an important indicator
of environmental adaptations responsible for bacterial
biodiversity.
Candidates should have an interest in structural biol-
ogy and bacteriology, and should enjoy working as part
of an active research team. Background experience in
one (or more) of the following elds is desirable, but
not required: bacteriology, (cryo-) electron microscopy,58 EvolDir August 1, 2012
and/or image processing/analysis techniques.
The wet laboratory is within the Division of Pediatric
Infectious Diseases and is fully equipped for all aspects
of microbiology, molecular biology, molecular virology,
and protein biochemistry. The Wright lab has com-
plete access to a JEOL 2200FS 200 kV FEG TEM with
an in-column energy lter, Zernike-style phase plates,
and high-resolution 4kx4k CCD camera; a JEOL 1400
120 kV TEM with 2kx2k camera; and an FEI Vitrobot
and a manual grid plunge freezer. Emory is a vibrant,
multidisciplinary campus with strong ties to Georgia
Tech and other universities within Georgia. Access to
facilities in NMR, Mass Spectrometry, and X-ray crys-
tallography are available.
Applicants should include a cover letter describing re-
search experience and interests, curriculum vitae, and
names and contact information for three references.

Phenoscape Bioinformatics
Postdoctoral fellow: Bioinformatics, Phenotypes
We are recruiting a postdoc with training in bioinfor-
matics who is interested in studying phenotypic evolu-
tion by combining model organism genetic data with
comparative anatomical data from throughout the ver-
tebrates.
One of the biggest challenges in systems biology is
the inclusion of whole organism phenotypes. In the
Phenoscape group, we have developed ontology-based
methods for representing phenotypes of diverse species
in order to integrate them with model organism devel-
opmental and genetic data,. We have collected theseAugust 1, 2012 EvolDir 61
data in a sophisticated Knowledgebase, which has an
initial focus on the diversity of phenotypes in ostar-
iophysan sh, including zebrash (kb.phenoscape.org).
We are currently scaling up our approach to the verte-
brates as a whole, with a goal of allowing similarities
to be identied between phenotypes from sources as di-
verse as dinosaur fossils and mouse knockout mutants.
We invite postdoctoral applicants to propose an inde-
pendent project that uses the Phenoscape Knowledge-
base as a research platform. In particular, we are inter-
ested in projects that will leverage functional genomic
data to study the evolution of whole-organism pheno-
type in nonmodel organisms.
The postdoc will work under the direction of Paula
Mabee (University of South Dakota) and Todd Vision
(University of North Carolina), as part of a distributed,
multidisciplinary team that includes evolutionary bi-

The control networks that drive cell division have
changed extensively during evolution to adapt to the
needs of myriad modern organisms. We aim to under-
stand this process of change.
One important signaling currency is phosphorylation.
Protein kinases such as the Cyclin-dependent kinase
(Cdk1) coordinate hundreds of cellular processes during
cell division by phosphorylating proteins and thereby
altering their activity. During evolution, kinases have
duplicated and diverged, adding complexity to cell divi-
sion signaling networks. For example, Cdk1 duplicated
about 800 million years ago and the duplicate gene di-
verged to give rise to a related kinase, Ime2. The ad-
dition of the Ime2 kinase enabled the conversion of the
single mitotic division to the double meiotic divisions
(seeMol. Cell. 2007 <http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/-
holt/PDFs/holt 2007.pdf >).
We aim to understand how cellular networks adapt
when a new kinase diverges and alters its specicity.
This event will incur a large cost, due to toxic phospho-
ryaltion events, and therefore must confer great bene-
ts to be selected for and xed in evolution. Our recent
work suggests that this benet can be readily obtained
for the simple reason that mechanisms of phosphoregu-
lation are quite simple and therefore easy to evolve (see-
Science 2009 <http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/holt/-
PDFs/holt 2009.pdf >). However, these ideas have yet
to be empirically tested. We aim to use synthetic biol-

UEdinburgh EvolutionDisease
Two full-time Research Fellowships are available in the
Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution at the
University of Edinburgh, UK.
The Wellcome Trust-funded Centre for Immunity, In-
fection and Evolution (CIIE; http://ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/-
) has become a major centre for interdisciplinary re-
search into infectious disease since its inception in 2008.
This thriving Centre is now looking to attract dynamic
and enthusiastic researchers, eager to operate at the in-
terface between disciplines (e.g. infection biology, im-
munology, evolutionary biology, ecology, epidemiology
and mathematical modelling) to create new research
paradigms to tackle infectious diseases.
CIIE is hosted within the Institute for Immunology
and Infection Research (http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-
departments/biology/immunology-infection) and Insti-
tute for Evolutionary Biology (http://www.ed.ac.uk/-
schools-departments/biology/evolutionary-biology),
these being part of the 'Edinburgh Infectious Disease'
research community, one of the largest groups of
infection biologists world-wide.
As part of our development, and with funding support
from the Wellcome Trust, we have launched a Fellow-
ship Programme. The 2-year Fellowships will full a
unique role in pursuing research projects designed be-
tween two complementary laboratories aimed at pro-
viding innovation and new insight into major questions
in infection, immunity ecology and evolution. An ex-ample set of proposed projects is available from the
Centre (http://ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/), although applicants
are encouraged to contact members of the Centre with
their own ideas or suggestions for a new project. The
projects are designed to provide proof-of-principle to
underpin new project grant applications or, ideally, fel-
lowship applications for follow-on funding beyond the
Centre's 2-year provision. The Fellows will work be-
tween two or more Principal Investigators one of whom
will be primarily responsible for providing mentorship
as well as research space and facilities required for the
Fellow's project, while consumables and other running
costs for the project (up to $10,000 per annum) will be
met by the Centre itself.
Successful candidates will hold, or expect to hold, a
PhD qualication, will have a good publication record
and the ability to design and lead an interdisciplinary
research programme in collaboration with others.

DiatomEvolution
A 1.5 year postdoctoral research position is available
with S. Collins (University of Edinburgh) and U. Riebe-
sell (GEOMAR, Kiel). Time will be spent at both in-
stitutions. Possibility of a further 2 year extension to
project.
In-situ and laboratory evolution of diatoms in response
to high light and CO2 levels.
Because marine phytoplankton have large population
sizes and reproduce quickly, they have the potential
to evolve over months or years, and there is evidence
that both freshwater microalgae, and calcifying marine
phytoplankton can evolve in response to CO2 enrich-
ment. Laboratory studies are done on single genotypes
or species in isolation, in an articial and very simple
environment, whereas all species evolving in the wild
must do so in the context of a community, which aects
evolutionary outcomes. We will use eld manipulations
and laboratory selection experiments to measure evolu-
tionary responses of diatoms to ocean acidication in
their natural communities, and compare this with the
evolution of those same diatoms in single-species lab-
oratory cultures. By combining eld and laboratory
evolutionary ecology studies, we will quantify the evo-
lutionary response of diatoms to ocean enrichment for
the rst time, as well as describe the relationship be-
tween laboratory and in situ evolutionary responses.
The postdoctoral research assistant will follow the win-
ter to summer seasonal succession of natural plank-
ton communities in sea-going mesocosm systems sub-
jected to dierent levels of CO2 enrichment as part of
the ongoing BIOACID program (Theme 1). http:/-
/www.bioacid.de/ They will participate in the meso-
cosm enrichment experiment near Kristineberg, Swe-
den (Feb-July 2013). They will gather data to quan-
tify the evolutionary response of diatoms to elevated
CO2 in situ. If the project is extended, diatoms iso-
lated from the mesocosms will be used for a laboratory
selection experiment so that evolution in situ and in
single-species microcosms can be compared.
A PhD in marine biology or phytoplankton physiology,
with lab experience, is required. Candidates who also
have experience with eldwork will be given preference.
A basic understanding of evolutionary biology is help-
ful, but most can be learned on the job, so long as thecandidate demonstrates a strong interest in the topic
along with a willingness to dive in.

UExeter ParasiteEvolution
We are looking to hire a postdoctoral research asso-
ciate on a 3-year project on parasite modulation of
metabolism.
An astonishing outcome of the antagonistic coevolu-
tionary dynamics between host and parasite is the evo-
lution of parasite ability to interfere with host phys-
iology. The molecular details of such interference is
poorly understood, limiting our ability to decipher par-
asite virulence and its evolution.
A major component of parasite mediated 'host repro-
gramming' targets host metabolism and thereby results
in improved parasite growth. A particularly striking
example of this is the ability of several viruses to in-
crease the rate of glycolysis in infected cells by up to
370%. More elaborate modulations include, for exam-
ple, the alteration of lipid and GTP biosynthesis. These
ndings strongly indicate that a full understanding of
host-pathogen interaction and pathogen-caused disease
states require a holistic view that considers host and
the pathogen as a single system.
This project will concentrate on the interaction of
Burkholderia pseudomallei and Francisella tularensis
with human macrophages. Utilizing metabolic mod-
eling together with phenotypic proling and ux mea-
surements, we will achieve a better understanding of
how these parasites manipulate their host and cause
disease. The ultimate aim is to develop better strate-
gies of combating intracellular parasites and developing
robust analysis approaches at the host-parasite systems
level.

ing your motivation) and the details of three referees

EvolutionSexualRecombination
A 3-year PDRA position is now available at the Univer-
sity of Hull as part of a large project entitled 'The Evo-
lutionary Genomics of Sexual Recombination'. This
ad refers to the 2nd of two postdocs on this project
who will carry out the molecular evolutionary analy-
ses. Using modern evolutionary comparative genomics
approaches we aim to study the rate and pattern of
genome sequence change with and without the action of
meiosis, and across dierent levels of inbreeding. The
project will be carried out in a phylogenetic design,
on a newly generated nematode multi-genome data set,
leading to advances in understanding the role of repro-
ductive mode in shaping the structure and diversity of
genomes.
The puzzling predominance of sexual reproduction
amongst animals has been repeatedly identied as one
of the major outstanding questions in biology and has
received an enormous amount of study. Meiotic recom-
bination is one of the fundamental forces of evolution
and plays a very signicant role in both generating and
mixing the genetic diversity present in sexual organ-
isms. Recombination is also suggested to be instru-
mental in shaping the content of eukaryotic genomes.
We are embarking on a three year project to study the
role of breeding system and recombination in shaping
the content and diversity of animal genomes using an
exceptionally powerful natural system - the Root Knot
Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). We will, for the rst
time, be able to take a comparative genomic view of
radically dierent reproductive modes in a phylogenetic
design. Together these studies will give us a novel and
powerful understanding of the role sexual reproduction
plays in shaping genome content.
This project is a collaboration between Dr Dave Lunt
at the University of Hull and Prof Mark Blaxter at
the University of Edinburgh. The goals of the project
are to generate complete, annotated genome sequences
for a set of Meloidogyne species (at least 16 genomes),
carefully chosen to represent independent evolutionary
contrasts in reproductive mode, and then to use these
whole genome data to characterise the eect of organis-mal breeding system on abundance, diversity and distri-
bution of transposable elements between amphimicts,
automicts, and apomicts. We will also test for adap-
tive evolution of genes and gene families using statisti-
cal models of gene family evolution, and test sequence
based signatures of adaptive evolution, relating these
to loci involved in reproduction and plant-parasite in-
teractions.
PDRA2- MOLECULAR EVOLUTIONARY ANALY-
SIS; UNIVERSITY OF HULL
Applicants with a strong background in evolutionary
biology, bioinformatics and population genetics are
invited for this PDRA position to analyse the new
genome datasets. The post-holder will use modern
evolutionary bioinformatic approaches to analyse trans-
posable elements, gene families and the type of muta-
tional patterns found across the phylogeny of nematode
genomes being generated in Edinburgh.
The PDRA will be based in the Evolutionary Biology
Group at Hull University. The group is a large and
interactive community of evolutionary biologists, with
excellent facilities, and provides a great environment for
investigating questions in genomics and breeding sys-
tem.
We anticipate the successful candidate will work proac-
tively and exibly across the research groups to gain
most from this enormous data set, address fundamental
biological questions, and produce some very substantial
publications.
You must have, or shortly obtain, a PhD in evolu-
tionary biology, bioinformatics, population genetics or
other directly relevant subject. An excellent under-
standing of the genetic consequences of sexual repro-
duction and the bioinformatic skills suitable to analyse
large datasets would be advantageous.

POSTDOC-position in ADAPTIVE MOLECULAR
ECOLOGY
Project on molecular evolution of olfactory communi-
cation under sexual selection in a buttery, Bicyclus
anynana
A two-year postdoctoral position is available at the
Earth and Life Institute, University of Louvain-la-
Neuve (UCL) in Belgium (http://www.uclouvain.be/-
en-bdiv.html). The position is part of a collabora-
tive 5-year research project on the role and mecha-
nisms of plasticity for present and future adaptation
and survival in changing environments using 4 model
organisms (two butteries Pararge aegeria and Bicy-68 EvolDir August 1, 2012
clus anynana, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae and
the unicellular eukaryotic ciliate Tetrahymena ther-
mophila). The research project is a collaboration be-
tween 3 dynamic research teams at UCL (Profs. Hans
Van Dyck (spokesman), Nicolas Schtickzelle and Caro-
line Nieberding) and their international partners.
Focus of the advertised Postdoc position will be on
the identication of the molecular bases for olfactory
communication evolution between males and females
in the model buttery Bicyclus anynana. The male sex
pheromone has been identied in this species and is un-
der sexual selection (1,2), and large-scale diversication
of the Bicyclus genus is associated to sexual selection
on the male blend (3). Recently, a transcriptome was
produced for investigating the molecular bases of male-
female olfactory interactions which provides material
for candidate genes analyses in an ecologically relevant
framework (4). The postdoc will be in charge of the
molecular work for candidate gene identication and
validation, aiming at unravelling the molecular bases
of olfactory communication and of its plasticity in the
rst buttery studied to date. Importantly, a molecu-
lar technician will be hired for the same period of time
and will be partly dedicated to process the lab work for
the postdoc. This position is under supervision of Prof.
C. Nieberding (UCL) who works in collaboration with
Dr. P. Beldade (Gulbenkian Institute of Science, IGC,
Portugal). In addition to his/her main research project
on Bicyclus, the successful applicant will also partici-
pate in helping to design other molecular projects (tran-
scriptome ananalyses) related to Pararge butteries and
Tetrahymena ciliates in collaboration with Profs. Van
Dyck and Schtickzelle. There are possibilities for ex-
tension of the postdoc position on alternative national
or international funding in case of shared interest.
We are looking for a strongly motivated candidate with
a PhD in the eld of Molecular Evolutionary Ecol-
ogy with successful experience in RNA work, candidate
gene searching and quantitative real time PCR. Inter-
est or experience in olfactory communication, sexual
selection, phenotypic plasticity and Lepidoptera are a
plus. Strong written and oral communication skills are
essential.
Salary ranges between 2000-2200 euros net per month
plus benets (health insurance,...) which are included
in the Belgian system. The successful applicant must
not have stayed in Belgium more than 24 months
out of the last three years. For practical informa-

BioinformaticsPhenotypes
Postdoctoral fellow: Bioinformatics, Phenotypes
We are recruiting a postdoc with training in bioinfor-
matics who is interested in studying phenotypic evolu-
tion by combining model organism genetic data with
comparative anatomical data from throughout the ver-
tebrates.
One of the biggest challenges in systems biology is
the inclusion of whole organism phenotypes. In the
Phenoscape group, we have developed ontology-based
methods for representing phenotypes of diverse species
in order to integrate them with model organism devel-
opmental and genetic data,. We have collected these
data in a sophisticated Knowledgebase, which has an
initial focus on the diversity of phenotypes in ostar-
iophysan sh, including zebrash (kb.phenoscape.org).
We are currently scaling up our approach to the verte-
brates as a whole, with a goal of allowing similarities
to be identied between phenotypes from sources as di-
verse as dinosaur fossils and mouse knockout mutants.
We invite postdoctoral applicants to propose an inde-
pendent project that uses the Phenoscape Knowledge-
base as a research platform. In particular, we are inter-
ested in projects that will leverage functional genomic
data to study the evolution of whole-organism pheno-
type in nonmodel organisms.
The postdoc will work under the direction of PaulaAugust 1, 2012 EvolDir 75
Mabee (University of South Dakota) and Todd Vision
(University of North Carolina), as part of a distributed,
multidisciplinary team that includes evolutionary bi-
ologists, computer scientists, model organism experts,
and bioinformaticists. It will be based in South Dakota,
with opportunities to travel to other sites, including the
National EvolutionarySynthesis Center (NESCent), the
University of Chicago, and the California Academy of
Sciences.
Starting date: This two year postdoctoral position is
available to be lled as early as September 2012.
Required qualications: Ph.D. degree with strong
background in bioinformatics; previous experience with
ontologies preferred
* Experience in functional genomics or developmen-
tal biology * Demonstrated communication and writing
skills, in English * Demonstrated ability to work in a
team setting
How to apply: Please contact Dr. Mabee
(pmabee@usd.edu) for inquiries. Applications should
be directed to Dr. Mabee and include a cover letter,
CV, a brief statement detailing your research interests
and career goals, and three letters of reference.

WORKSHOP DEADLINE (for the lecture) HAS
BEEN EXTENDED!!!
The Organizing Committee would like to invite you to
attend a 3-day international workshop on the \Evolu-
tion and Ecology of Host-Associated Microbiota" to be
held at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel,
Switzerland on September 12- 14, 2012. The major
aim of this workshop is to provide a synthesis of the
emerging evolutionary and ecological patterns govern-
ing the complex interactions of host-microbiota across
dierent biological systems. We have invited leaders
in the eld of host-associated microbiota and micro-
bial ecology to share their insights on the evolutionary
and ecological principles that shape bacterial commu-
nity structure and host-microbiota interactions.
This workshop is intended for undergraduate students,
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early
career investigators (100 slots available) who wanted to
be exposed to the evolutionary and ecological concepts
and bioinformatics tools being applied on the study of
host-associated microbiota systems and microbial ecol-
ogy. Together with the lecture, a hands-on tutorial
(bioinformatic tools and approaches encompassing mi-
crobial ecology, comparative genomics, molecular evo-
lution) will be provided on the analysis of complex se-
quence data sets derived from next-generation sequenc-
ing.
Thanks to the generous funding from ProDoc of the
Swiss National Science Foundation and the University
of Basel, we are only charging a minimal fee of CHF
150 for registration (includes 3 lunches, 1 social
dinner, 2 social mixers and snacks during the entire
workshop) or CHF 250 (+ tutorial on the analysis of
next-generation sequences; 50 slots available). We also
have arranged for a number of rooms around Basel
ranging from youth hostel dormitories (CHF 32-79/
day) to 3-star hotels (CHF 160- 250/ day). Moreover,
Basel/Mulhouse Airport is a hub for Easyjet, a budget
airline in Europe. Application deadline for the tutorial
is May 30 and for the lecture series is July 15, 2012.

Course Description Overview Technological advances inDNA sequencing have led to the adoption of sequence-
based typing methods as the standard techniques for
bacterial identication at strain level, specially due to
their portability and reproducibility. The widespread
use of remotely accessible databases oering dierent
typing data and the development of diverse data analy-
sis techniques show the impact of Bioinformatics in this
eld, and the need for understanding how to operate
with the databases and algorithms. Recently, the ca-
pability of sequencing whole bacterial genomes in a few
days using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method-
ologies, opened a new door for the development of more
sophisticated strain identication tools.
Objectives This training course is directed for the data
analysis of sequence based typing methods, from the
raw-data to the identication of a strain type by sev-
eral typing methodologies, and the use of analysis al-
gorithms to create groups of related strains. It will
span from Single Locus Sequence Typing methods, such
as spa typing or emm typing, to the now established
MultiLocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Multilocus
Variable Number of Tandem Repeats Analysis (MLVA)
methodologies. The course will also cover methods that
apply to whole genome sequence data, and show how
NGS data can be analyzed and made sense of, in this
context. The course will be essentially hands-on. Short
presentations will be interweaved by tutored assited ex-
ercises. The participants are expected to gradually gain
user independence by acquiring new analytical skils in
using software and online databases for specic typing
methods. Special attention will be given to methods
that can use NGS datasets.
Target Audience This course is aimed to anyone work-
ing in molecular epidemiology, that wants to develop or
consolidate skills in the use and analysis of sequence-
based typing methods. The course will be illustrated
with examples from dierent bacterial species, but the
concepts are applicable to any species and to other
sequence-based typing methods, not explicitly referred
to in the course.
Course Pre-requisites Basic understanding of molecular
biology, namely in microbial typing methodologies and
elementary computer interaction skills are expected.

Dear All,
We are pleased to announce an \Ecology Meets
Medicine" retreat on the 14th to 17th of August
2012 at Gregynog Hall in Mid Wales, http://-
www.wales.ac.uk/en/UniversityConferenceCentre/-
GregynogHall.aspx The retreat will centre around two
key topics, \Evolution" - examining issues relating to
drug resistance and parasite / pathogen virulence and
\Co-infection" - examining the role of parasite-parasite
interaction in driving infection dynamics. The retreat
will bring together researchers to identify the current
progress in these elds and to facilitate the formation
of collaborative research teams to address the \big
issues". We also hope that the retreat will lead on toreview papers led by the participants.
Numbers are restricted to 40 delegates. If you would
like to attend please contact Dr. Jo Lello, lel-
loj@cf.ac.uk with your name and aliation, career
stage, and a few lines explaining why you wish to attend
and what your expertise is.
Costs are $215 for faculty member and $100 for fel-
lows, post-docs and students. Costs are subsidised by
the British Ecological Society and include accommoda-
tion and all meals.
The closing date for registration is the Sunday the 15th
July 2012
We look forward to seeing you there.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.August 1, 2012 EvolDir 83
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
