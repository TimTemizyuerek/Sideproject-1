SMBE Satellite Meeting on Evolutionary Rescue Kiel
University, Germany, 11-14 September 2022
Conference website: https://-
workshops.evolbio.mpg.de/event/57/ We are currently
living in the Anthropocene and thus an era shaped by
human impact. The environmental conditions imposed
by these human-driven rapid environmental changesexert selective pressure on natural systems and can
result in an evolutionary mismatch between slowly
evolving organisms and their new environment, and
rapid adaptation of many short-lived species. Evolution-
ary rescue, which occurs when populations subjected to
stress avoid extinction by adaptation through natural
selection, is relevant to both consequences: it can help
to overcome the evolutionary mismatch and is at the
basis of rapid evolution of pathogens.
In this SMBE Satellite meeting we aim to focus on evo-
lutionary rescue in three main elds: species conserva-
tion, agriculture, and medicine. These three main elds
currently face unforetold challenges due to evolution-
ary processes invoked by the dramatic human-mediated
changes of the Anthropocene, including:
- Risk of species extinction and thus dramatic reduc-
tions in biodiversity due to an evolutionary mismatch
caused by climate change, globalization, and pathogen
evolution - Risk of dramatic yield reductions in food
production due to an evolutionary mismatch caused
by climate change, globalization, and pathogen evolu-
tion - Major threats to human health because of rapid
pathogen evolution and increased pathogen spread due
to globalization - Rapid evolution of pathogens, para-
sites, and pest species and especially fast evolution of
resistance to chemotherapy and pesticides
By incorporating diverse perspective from multiple elds,
we hope to identify knowledge gaps and putative novel
research directions in the context of evolutionary rescue
in the Anthropocene.

Title: A compendium of uniformly processed human
gene expression and splicing quantitative trait loci
Abstract:Many gene expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) studies have published their summary statistics,
which can be used to gain insight into complex human
traits by downstream analyses, such as ne mapping
and co-localization. However, technical dierences be-
tween these datasets are a barrier to their widespread
use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide
association study (GWAS) signals have still not been
identied. In the present study, we present the eQTL
Catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl), a resource of
quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expres-
sion and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We nd that,
for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL eect sizes
are highly reproducible between studies. Although most
QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identi-
ed a greater diversity of cell-type-specic QTLs from
puried cell types, a subset of which also manifested as
new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are
freely available to enable the systematic interpretation
of human GWAS associations across many cell types
and tissues.

Dear all,
Next speaker: Wednesday, May 4th, 12-13 CET, Lind-
say Hall, Professor, Quadram Institute will be present\Exploring the delicate balance of the early life gut mi-
crobiota"
This will be an online event. Contact us <https://-
cigene.no/contact/ >to receive the meeting link.
Abstract: Initial colonisation of the gut by pioneer bac-
terial species is the rst key step for host well-being.
The process of initial gut microbiota colonisation in
preterm babies is radically interrupted due to a variety
of factors including mode of delivery and antibiotics.
This aberrant colonisation of premature infants appears
pivotal to the development of a number of diseases, in-
cluding necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). I will discuss
how the microbiota 'balance' in the preterm gut impacts
NEC outcomes - exploring the role of both benecial
and pathogenic microbiota members.

Title: Divergence and convergence of Uralic languages
and Finnish dialects
Abstract:
Both in biological species and languages, the process of
divergence is counteracted by population convergences.
In biology, the degree of convergence can be measured
as gene ow indicating direction and intensity of genetic
contact between populations. Adapting the populationJune 1, 2022 EvolDir 11
genetic admixture model BAPS for language data, we
calculated 'language ow' values for Finnish dialects to
measure linguistic contacts. The 'language ow' values
were further used to study the drivers of linguistic con-
tacts. I will discuss the potential of population genetic
admixture models to measure independently language
divergence and convergence.

search), Alejandro Couce (Polytechnic University of
Madrid)
Lead Organizers: James Horton (University of Bath)

tory)
Abstract submission deadline: June 28, 2022
Registration deadline: July 5, 2022
Abstract: Dierent types of mutations vary in their
rate of occurrence, a phenomenon known as mutationbias. Such biases are well understood to exert direc-
tional inuences on patterns of neutral genetic variation.
However, mounting evidence also supports a role for
mutation bias in guiding the direction of adaptive evo-
lution. Theoretical modeling has shown that adaptive
evolution can enrich for mutationally-favored but selec-
tively sub-optimal alleles, and recent empirical studies
have found biases among documented adaptive sub-
stitutions consistent with these theoretical predictions.
In particular, these studies have shown that mutation
types favored by a handful of specic biases, such as
transition-transversion bias and CpG hotspots, are also
statistically overrepresented among adaptive amino acid
substitutions. However, a number of key questions re-
main unanswered regarding how mutation and selection
interact during adaptive evolution. For instance, the
roles of dierent types of mutation bias in adaptation are
not well understood. These include context-dependent
biases involving anking nucleotides, spatial heterogene-
ity in mutation rates across the genome, idiosyncratic
mutation signatures driven by either endogenous pro-
cesses or external environmental exposures, and her-
itable variation in mutation biases as often observed
in mutator strains or even in dierent human popula-
tions. This symposium will showcase recent advances
in understanding the complex interplay between muta-
tion and selection in shaping molecular adaptation, and
will include contributions from a wide array of systems
including experimental evolution, protein evolution, par-
allel adaptation and evolutionary prediction, evolution
of drug and pesticide resistance, and cancer.

SpeciesDistributions Aug1-10
CallAbstracts
Biological dispersal: connections at continental and in-
tercontinental scales.
For a long time, scientists have been fascinated by the
idea that species might disperse long distances, and how
dispersal might underpin distributions; the \grand game
of chess with the world for a board" as Charles Darwin
wrote in one of his letters. We now have a wealth of
powerful methods to investigate where, when and how
biological dispersal occurs. Understanding the processes
and patterns of species distribution and ecological and
genetic connectivity of populations is particularly rele-
vant in the geographically isolated and rapidly warming
Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. How will species in
these regions respond to environmental changes? Which
can or can't shift their distributions through dispersal?Where are the biogeographic barriers, and where are
the primary dispersal pathways? What mechanisms
do dierent species use to disperse? This session will
bring together recent research on active and passive
dispersal of Antarctic organisms at regional, continental
and intercontinental scales. We particularly welcome
talks that bring together dierent sources of evidence
to investigate dispersal and the processes that drive it,
and / or that shed light on species distributions and
population connectivity, in and around the Antarctic
and sub-Antarctic.

Graduate position: AMUPoznan BehavioralEcology
PhD position in the project \Linking immunogenetic
variation, microbiome and personality" is available for
three years starting from 1st October 2022. The project
is led by Magdalena Herdegen-Radwan (Adam Mick-
iewicz University, Poznan), and is funded by Polish Sci-
ence Centre (NCN). The student will receive a stipend
of 5000 PLN/month for three years. In addition to car-
rying out research, the student will have opportunity to
attend specialized courses for PhD students in English.
The candidate should hold MSc degree in biological sci-
ences. Interested candidates should sent their CV and a
motivation letter (via email) to the project leader, who
will provide further information about the project and
application procedure (email: magher@amu.edu.pl).
Project summary:
During the last decades, the eld of animal personalities
ourished bringing signicant advances in our knowl-
edge of their importance for individual tness, but the
mechanisms maintaining variation in those traits are still
not clear. In parallel, research on animal microbiome
advanced bringing strong evidence for complex inter-
actions between microbial communities harboured by
animals and host behaviour, including personality, and
resulted in revealing links between host gut microbiome
and various behaviourally expressed decits in humans
and animal models of human behaviours. However, stud-
ies on undisturbed populations of non-model species are
rare, leaving open the question of the importance of mi-
crobial variation in such populations. Even more scarce
are studies testing microbiome eects on tness, and
those few that do measure some tness-related traits
did not incorporate the personality dimension, leaving
open an important question of whether microbiomes
can aect tness via their eects on personality. The
rst aim of this project is to ll this gap of knowledge
by testing (hypothesis I) that gut microbiome aects
a personality trait with documented eect on tness,
using both correlational and manipulative approach.
Additionally, I will test another intriguing hypothesis
(II), that it is the sperm microbiota that aects thetness-related personality trait. A tempting indication
for such an eect is the correlation between male bold-
ness and sperm number reported in guppy - the species
and personality trait I plan to use here.
An important reason for variation in microbiome com-
position is immunogenetic variation. One of the hy-
potheses links the genetic variation at MHC, a complex
of immune molecules of the adaptive immune system
responsible for antigen presentation, to microbiome vari-
ation. While there are some hints as to the links of
MHC separately with either microbiome or personali-
ties, the integration of those MHC-related processes in
microbiome-personality framework is missing. There-
fore, the other aim of the project will be to investigate
the eect of MHC genotype on personality via micro-
biome (hypothesis III).
I will use a large, outbred guppy population in which
I previously showed that male boldness is a highly re-
peatable personality trait and positively associated with
reproductive success 1. In the correlational approach, I
will correlate the boldness level in untreated males form
the general population with the microbiome found in
their gastro-intestinal tract (hypothesis I) or on their
sperm (hypothesis II). These correlational analyses, un-
like the manipulation-based studies of microbiome ef-
fects, will allow to conclude if the putative association
is strong enough to have ecological meaning in non-
manipulated, healthy populations, which is one the
strengths of the present project. Incorporating indi-
vidual MHC proles into these analyses will allow to
assess its association with both the microbiome and the
personality (hypothesis III).
In the test of hypothesis I using experimental manip-
ulation I will check if transfer of bold- and shy-guppy
derived gut microbiome into the gut of guppies from two
respective treatments will aect their boldness. While
performing microbiome transplantation, I will choose
individuals so as to obtain groups of MHC-similar and
-dissimilar individuals, which will allow me to test if
immunogenetic prole determines boldness level via its
eect of host microbiome (hypothesis III). The integra-
tion of the three dimensions of animal phenotype mostly
studied in tandems, i.e. the microbiome, personality
and immunogenetics, in relation to their eect on t-
ness, will constitute the innovative value of the present
project.16 EvolDir June 1, 2022

PhD position: Predicting the eects of hybridization
on forest adaptation in the context of global climate
disruption
Summary: Climate change threatens our forests and
the multiple services they provide. Hybridization is
one of the possible genetic mechanisms for resilience
and adaptation of natural and plantation-based forest
stands to this threat. We propose to model the adaptive
impacts of hybridization of the native silver r (Abies
alba Mill.) in mainland France, a species vulnerable to
climate change, by more drought-resistant species of the
genus Abies. To this end, we will modify a physio-demo-
genetic model (PDG) developed at INRAE, simulating
tree growth, survival, reproduction, migration and ge-
netic evolution at the population level, to integrate
gene ow between \sister" species of dierent adaptive
potentials.
We will focus on tree traits related leaf phenology (bud
break date) and response to water stress (stomatal clo-
sure and xylem vulnerability to cavitation). These traits
determine drought and late frost susceptibility, which
are the two main climatic risks aecting Mediterranean
r trees.
The thesis will contribute to the development of a generic
modeling tool, allowing to evaluate the evolutionary
consequences of hybridization between sister species.
The thesis will also address the possible positive conse-
quences of hybridization (genetic enrichment, mitigation
of the risk of decline), but also its potential negative
consequences (risk of maladaptation, of loss of local
genetic diversity) associated with climate change.

At the University of Greifswald's DFG-funded Research
Training Group RTG 2010 - \Biological responses to
novel and changing environments - RESPONSE", sub-
project 4, there is a job vacancy expected to be available
from 1 July 2022, subject to the allocation of funds, for
a part-time (65 %)
Doctoral researcher The employment is limited until 31
March 2024. We will try to secure a follow-up nancing.
Payment will be made according to pay group 13 TV-L
Wissenschaft.
The ability to respond to novel and changing environ-
mental conditions, either by phenotypic plasticity, ge-
netic adaptation, or range shifts, is pivotal to the longer-
term survival of all organisms. Owing to increasing con-
cerns about the consequences of human-induced global
change, such responses have attracted increasing interest
in recent years. RESPONSE focuses on the plastic and
genetic capacities for in situ responses (cluster A) and on
the factors limiting or facilitating dispersal to new habi-
tats (cluster B). The RTG aims at deepening our under-
standing of the limits to population persistence, enabling
more accurate predictions regarding the fate of popu-
lations under changing conditions. Our research pro-
gramme spans dierent levels of biological organisation,
ranging from molecular and physiological mechanisms
to ecological population-level responses, and a wide vari-ety of organisms including lichens, myxomycetes, plants
(trees), and animals (snails, crustaceans, insects, spiders,
bats). The proposed project adds to the overall aims of
RESPONSE by investigating the factors underlying the
dispersal and colonization pattern of the buttery Pieris
mannii - a species showing a rapid range expansion
across Central Europe.
Work tasks: In the proposed project B4, the dispersal
and colonization patterns of the Souther Small White
(Pieris mannii) will be investigated. This buttery
species is currently undergoing a rapid northward ex-
pansion and is therefore ideally suited for RESPONSE's
research program. The candidate will not only focus on
the genetic and morphological analysis of the expand-
ing populations, but also investigate their physiological
potential in comparison to their original ranges. A
teaching programme accompanies the interdisciplinary
research strategy. It covers dierent scientic topics
and techniques relevant to the RTG as well as soft skills
relevant to career development, and includes summer
schools, journal clubs, practical courses, lectures, as well
as individualised education and mentoring programmes.
Each doctoral project involves research stays at dier-
ent laboratories, partly abroad. The participation in
the teaching programme is mandatory. Tasks will be
transferred that are conducive to the preparation of a
doctorate.
Requirements: We invite applications from highly mo-
tivated candidates with above-average qualications, a
passion for and experience in research, and the willing-
ness to make active contributions to the RTG. Successful
applicants must 1) hold a M.Sc. degree (or equivalent)
in Biology or another relevant discipline, 2) have a solid
background in ecology and evolutionary biology, 3) ex-
perience with methods and/or organisms relevant to the
RTG, 4) have an excellent command of English, which is
the ocial language of the RTG, and 5) be motivated to
join an interdisciplinary research training environment.
The position is open to all persons, irrespective of gender.
The University would like to increase the proportion of
women in areas in which they are underrepresented and
thus applications from women are particularly welcome
and will be treated with priority if they have the same
qualications and as long as there are no clear reasons
which make a fellow applicant more suitable. Severely
disabled applicants with the same qualications will
be considered with preference. According to  c 68(3)
PersVG M-V, the Sta Council will only be involved in
sta matters of the academic or artistic sta on request.
Please only submit copies of your application documents

COLLABORATIONS AND NETWORKING The PhD
student will be able to interact with our network of
collaborators. Locally, strong interactions already ex-
ist with Veronique Decrooq & Quynh-Trang Bui (BFP,
INRAE Bordeaux). They work on the genomic bases
of adaptation and domestication in apricot trees and
share the same interest in SV and tree pan-genome
dynamics. Thus, a long term collaboration is ongoing.
The candidate will also collaborate with national ex-
perts in genome assemblies and annotations (Jean-Marc
Aury from G enoscope, William Marande from CNRGV,
INRAE URGI sta members), structural variation anal-
yses (Olivier Panaud, from Perpignan University), com-
parative genomics and population genetics (within the
BIOGECO and BFP).
FULL SUMMARY WITH OBJECTIVES: Structural
variation (SV) - i.e. pieces of DNA being deleted, in-
serted, or rearranged among chromosomes - strongly
inuences gene content and genome structure within
and between closely related species. SV may have strong
impacts on phenotypes of ecological and agronomical
interest but are poorly captured when genotypes are
produced in comparison to one single reference genome.June 1, 2022 EvolDir 21
Consequently, the evolutionary dynamics of SV in nat-
ural populations (mutation rate, role of selection in
shaping genetic variation) and their role in local adap-
tation remain poorly documented compared to that of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), especially in
forest tree species. Hence, in order to capture variation
of SV and its impact on phenotypic variation, compara-
tive and evolutionary genomics areas are now turning to
pan-genome based analyses of genetic variation. White
Oaks are species of ecological, economic and cultural
importance in Europe, accounting for a third of the
metropolitan French forests (i.e. 5M ha). These popu-
lations display signs of stress or even decline related to
biotic and abiotic stresses and their adaptive potential
in the context of climate changes is uncertain. The
genome of the pedunculate oak was sequenced recently,
providing the blueprints to discover genes underlying
adaptive variation in these keystone species. However,
given the complicated speciation history of white oaks
(with a recent secondary contact between species), it is
highly likely that

Ph.D. Student position: The diversity and evolution of
insect microbial symbionts
We are looking for a motivated and enthusiastic candi-
date for a Ph.D. Student position in Biology at Jagiel-
lonian University in Krakow, Poland. The Student will
be involved in the NCN Opus project \The patterns,
factors, and drivers of insect microbiome variability".
The project is a collaboration between dr Anna Michalik
(Institute of Zoology and Biomedical Research) and dr
hab. Piotr ukasik (Institute of Environmental Sciences;
symbio.eko.uj.edu.pl).
The Student will address a series of questions about the
diversity, specicity, transmission, and roles of insect
microbial symbionts. The research will focus on hoppers
(Auchenorrhyncha), a diverse and ecologically and eco-
nomically signicant clade of hemipterans (true bugs)
that includes planthoppers, leafhoppers, treehoppers,spittlebugs, and cicadas. Their nutrient-limited diet of
plant sap is supplemented by specialized heritable bac-
terial symbionts that produce amino acids and vitamins.
These symbionts co-diversify with hosts - but in many
insect lineages, they were joined or replaced by other
microbes that contribute nutritional functions. Many
of them also host heritable facultative endosymbionts
such as Wolbachia and Rickettsia that may aect insect
reproduction, resistance to natural enemies, or abili-
ties to vector plant pathogens. All these microbes can
play critical importance in insect biology, but there is
rapidly accumulating evidence that the infections may
vary among insect clades, species, populations, and even
individuals sampled at the same time, at the same site.
Unfortunately, we know very little about these diversity
patterns or their biological importance.
The Student will address these questions using a com-
bination of eld collections across Central Europe and
Baltic countries, high-throughput sequencing and bioin-
formatic analysis of host and symbiont marker genes
and metagenomes, and microscopy (light microscopy,
transmission electron microscopy [TEM], uorescence
in-situ hybridization [FISH]).
The Student will be encouraged to work closely with
other team members and project collaborators in Poland
and abroad, and supported in pursuing their related
ideas. The Student will be based at one of the top
research institutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolu-
tion in Central Europe, in a medieval city known as
the cultural capital of Poland, with good access to out-
door recreation opportunities and well-connected to the
rest of Europe. A competitive stipend is available for
the suitable candidate. We have generous funding for
research and research travel.
The successful candidate will have an M.Sc. degree
in a relevant eld by September 2022; a demonstrated
interest in Evolution, Entomology, Microbiology, and/or
Genomics; experience with, or a keen interest in learning,
Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Microscopy
techniques; and strong English language, communica-
tion, and organizational skills. Previous experience
with insect diversity, ecology, evolution, and especially
symbioses, molecular biology, microbiome surveys, phy-
logenomics and/or comparative genomics, as well as
willingness to travel are advantageous.
The candidates are asked to e-mail a cover letter explain-
ing their background, skills, and interest in the project,
a CV, and contact details of two academics who can
provide a condential reference, to Dr. Anna Michalik
(a.michalik@uj.edu.pl). Informal inquiries are welcome.
The review of applications is ongoing; please apply by
15th June 2022 to ensure full consideration. The se-22 EvolDir June 1, 2022
lected candidate or candidates will be assisted with a
formal application for the Ph.D. Program in Biology at

Expression of interest: PhD scholarship behavioural
adaptation to climate change in fairy-wrens
I'm looking for outstandingcandidates who wish to ap-
ply for a competitive PhD scholarship at James Cook
University (Townsville, Australia) to study topics re-
lated to behavioural adaptation to climate change using
fairy-wrens as a study system. The project involves a
combination of eldwork in south-west Australia with
analyses of long-term datasets.
Summary: It has been suggested that social species have
evolved in harsh environmental conditions, allowing for
successful reproduction and survival in environments
where pairs alone cannot succeed. This implies that
social behaviour may buer against adverse weather
conditions. However, an overlooked issue is that social
behaviour itself will also be aected by adverse weather.
This project will study the dynamic interplay between
ecological conditions and social behaviour through new
experiments and detailed behavioural observations using
an iconic Australian bird as a model system.
You need to be eligible to apply for an (International)

Doctoral research on evolutionary genetics of human
cold adaptation
Human Evolutionary Genetics lab at KU Leuven is
a dynamic team of driven, enthusiastic and inclusive
scientists. We use genomic information from human
populations to address questions about demographic
history and selection. In this position, you will play a
key role in the FWO-funded research on cold adaptation
that strives to expand our knowledge of the regions of
the genome that have been targets of selection and to
functionally study the role of such genes in Drosophila
model.
Project Genetic adaptations are important in determin-
ing long-term survival and distribution of species across
a range of dierent environments. Humans are a trop-
ically adapted species that expanded only recently to
high latitudes. The genetic basis and the molecular
mechanisms that govern human adaptation to high lati-
tude environments, including adaptations to diet and
cold, remain incompletely understood. We previously
identied genomic regions with evidence of positive se-
lection in human populations living in the extreme cold
conditions in Central and Northeast Siberia. Many of
these genomic regions include genes of unknown functionJune 1, 2022 EvolDir 23
while showing a signicant enrichment of liver-expression
consistent with the proposed role of the liver as an im-
portant metabolic hub. Your role in this project will be
to consolidate the list of human cold adaptation candi-
date genes by further selection scans on human genomic
data. In parallel to the work on human genes, and in
collaboration with Prof. Patrick Callaert's team in the
same department, we will use Drosophila melanogaster
as a genetic model for the functional annotation of
poorly annotated genes associated with cold adaptation
in humans to gain a better understanding of the genetic
basis and the molecular mechanisms behind human cold
adaptation.
Prole You ideally have:

SalmonClimateAdaptation
Graduate Student Position (Ph.D.): Characterizing
mechanisms of rapid adaptation to predict responses to
climate change in Atlantic salmon
We are seeking a graduate student (PhD funded for 4
years) to work on thermal tolerance and climate adapta-
tion in wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Newfound-
land, Canada. The position will be held at Memorial
University of Newfoundland and Labrador (MUNL) in
St. John's and will be co-supervised by Dr. Sarah
Lehnert of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and Dr.
Ian Fleming of MUNL's Department of Ocean Sciences.
The position is fully funded through NSERC and DFO.
Major scholarship holders will receive generous top-ups
to their awards.
Atlantic salmon is a culturally, economically, and ecolog-
ically important species, and many populations range-
wide are experiencing declines in abundance with climate
change being identied as one potential contributing
factor. In Atlantic Canada, warming river tempera-
tures continue to result in sheries closures and mor-
tality events for Atlantic salmon. These events are
expected to become more frequent under future climate
scenarios. Currently, there is limited knowledge on how
Atlantic salmon populations will respond to climate
change. While evidence suggests that salmon can adapt
to warmer temperatures, there are upper limits to this
capacity that depend on both environmental and ge-June 1, 2022 EvolDir 25
netic factors. To understand and predict the eects
of climate change on salmon in freshwater, this PhD
project will use eld and tank-based experiments to
measure thermal tolerance and stress in Atlantic salmon
from populations spanning a thermal gradient. The
project will also employ both genomic and transcrip-
tomic approaches to identify key genes and mechanisms
underlying thermal adaptation and will build on cur-
rent forecasting methods to understand and predict the
eects of climate change on salmon populations.
Prospective students should be prepared to share their
enthusiasm for research and associated skills openly
within and among the research groups, and by doing so,
contribute to a dynamic research environment. While
they will be based in the respective laboratories in St.
John's at MUNL and DFO, students should be prepared
to travel to rivers around Newfoundland for eldwork.
Qualications: The ideal candidate will possess an MSc;
have research interests and training in the areas of sh
ecology or physiology and molecular biology; be capable
of designing and undertaking both eld and laboratory
research; and have reasonable facility with the analysis
of large data sets.
Start date: The ideal start date is on or before Septem-
ber 2022, although later dates are possible.
How to apply: Prospective candidates should email a
cover letter, CV, unocial transcripts, and contact in-
formation for three people who can serve as references.
Review of applicants will begin June 1 2022 and con-
tinue until the position is lled. An email can be sent
to both Drs. Sarah Lehnert and Ian Fleming.
We are committed to promoting equity, diversity, and in-
clusivity in sheries research. We encourage people from
historically underrepresented groups to apply for this
position, including women, Indigenous peoples, persons
with disabilities, members of visible/racialized minori-

Title: Interactions between the human and dengue virus
genomes
Supervisor: Vincent Pedergnana, CRCN, vin-

Subject description:
Our main objective is to identify new genes in the host
and virus genomes that explain the pathogenicity of
the dengue virus. We will also aim at identifying new
targets to potentially develop a new therapy and a vac-
cine against dengue. Indeed, the targets identied over
the last 15 years have not been able to control the epi-
demic. Drug development needs the support of genomics
to identify promising new targets, as these have been
shown to be more likely to lead to eective therapeutics.
However, to date, only two human targets have been
identied for dengue.
We propose to apply the new genetic analysis techniques
that Dr. Pedergnana and colleagues have recently de-
veloped to identify more targets and more important
interaction points between the viral and human genomes
at the same time. This approach represents a signi-
cant improvement over current solutions by integrating
the genomes of both interacting organisms in the same
analysis.
In addition, we will explore, through phylogenetic re-
construction, inter- and intra-host viral diversity during
acute infection, which will allow us to better understand
the revealed genomic interactions.
PhD student role: Dr. Pedergnana and Dr. Guindon
will co-supervise the PhD student. Their laboratories
are both located in Montpellier, which will be an asset
for this double supervision, allowing frequent interac-
tions with both supervisors for the PhD student as well
as providing a stimulating and complementary environ-
ment and scientic communities. Thus, the doctoral
student will share his/her time between the two sites,
depending on the specic objectives of his/her thesis.
The PhD student will have a strong background in math-26 EvolDir June 1, 2022
ematics, population genomics and statistical genetics,
and be able to code and work on a cluster. He/she
will be primarily responsible for the genetic analysis
and the development of statistical methods under the
supervision of Drs Pedergnana and Guindon. He/she
will rst reconstruct viral genomes from the viral se-
quences obtained by full genome sequencing. He/she
will then construct consensus genomes and call the viral
variants. Based on these data, she/he will reconstruct
viral phylogenies and estimate intra- and inter-host vi-
ral diversity. Dr. Guindon will supervise this rst part.
She/he will then cut the human genetic data and deduce
the missing genotypes and HLA alleles. Finally, he/she
will be able to integrate the human clinical and genomic
data and perform a genome-to-genome analysis under
the supervision of Dr. Pedergnana.
The PhD student will be fully involved in the develop-
ment of statistical methods. He/she will also participate
in national or international conferences to present the
results of this project. Finally, he/she will be the rst au-
thor of any manuscript resulting from this work. He/she
will be able to attend any courses that may help in the
development of his/her career.
Expected Prole: This position is ideal for someone
with a combination of interest in theory, real world data,
and public health. Curiosity and the ability to learn
are more important than specic training. Essential
requirements include. - Master's degree in statistical
genetics, genetic epidemiology, evolutionary genetics or
statistics and strong analytical and quantitative skills. -
Prociency in at least one programming language (e.g.,
R, Python). - Excellent written and oral communication

ParasiteDormancyCoevolution
Dear Evoldir community,
The Professorship for Population Genetics welcomes
applications for one PhD position.
Title: \Causes and consequences of dor-
mancy/quiescence evolution in parasites
Topic: Quiescence and dormancy evolve as a bet-hedging
evolutionary strategies in many plants, animals, and
micro-organisms (including parasites or pathogens) in
unpredictable environments. Dormancy/quiescence de-
termines the rate of genomic evolution (see work by the
Tellier lab) but is also of practical relevance for diseaseJune 1, 2022 EvolDir 31
management. Indeed, dormant/quiescent parasites have
the ability to escape drug treatment. It is therefore
of interest to understand the evolutionary mechanisms
promoting dormancy/quiescence in parasites. The cen-
tral hypothesis of the project states that coevolution
between hosts and their parasites promotes bet-hedging.
We have previously shown that 1) seed banking and
dormancy can evolve in hosts due to coevolutionary dy-
namics, and 2) depending on the germination function,
the seed bank itself can slow down or even damp o
the coevolutionary oscillations. As allele frequency os-
cillations are critical to promote bet-hedging evolution,
a complex eco-evolutionary interplay occurs between
the evolution of dormancy and coevolutionary dynamics
(Verin and Tellier, Evolution, 2018). The goal of this
theoretical project is to understand and predict the con-
ditions for parasites to evolve dormancy or quiescence
as bet-hedging strategies in response to coevolution and
hosts' life-history traits. We will study the conditions
for bet-hedging to evolve under coevolutionary (epi-
demiological) dynamics by using models of short and
very long dormancy. We will use analytical methods of
adaptive dynamics to derive analytical solutions for the
ESS of dormancy/quiescence under dierent parameter
regimes.
We look for a PhD candidate with strong foundations
in mathematics/theoretical physics (deterministic and
stochastic modelling) and/or theoretical population ge-
netics. The doctoral candidates will be part of the TUM
Graduate School (www.gs.tum.de) and work in an in-
terdisciplinary project team. The PhD candidate will
be based in the Professorship for Population Genetics

Following the 2019 Nobel prices for Profs Major and
Queloz, the University of Geneva is developing a Cen-
tre for Life in the Universe. Within this new Centre 2
PhD positions are available to study experimental evo-
lution of life forms from Earth under conditions found
on planets elsewhere.
Life is dened by the capacity of Darwinian evolution.
Experimental evolution has proven to be one of the most
powerful tools to study the mechanisms of evolution on
Earth. Evolution that drove the diversication of life
from a simple and homogenous beginning. We aim to
perform experimental evolution and observe which geno-
and phenotypic traits will be favored under conditions
found on dierent planets. For this we assume that there
is a core to life that is similar on Earth and elsewhere,
so that presently the best model system to study Life
in the Universe are life-forms found on Earth. There
are many organisms(facultatively) adapted to life in the32 EvolDir June 1, 2022
absence of oxygen (e.g. methanogens, yeast). Some of
these function with very simple substrates, for example
methane production occurring fromhydrogenotrophic
processes, where the substrates could be from expelled
biogases of other organisms or by carbonate rock ero-
sion (4H2 + CO2 - CH4+ 2H2O). These processes also
alter the balance of the stable C isotopes in the system
(^A~A13C). From this perspective, we propose conducting
experiments on organism evolution in alternative envi-
ronments (various substrates and initial atmospheres,
such as H2 + N2 mixture or CO2). Besides quantifying
the organism' ^As evolutionary trajectory, we propose
to monitor - usingexisting equipment in Department
Forel - the various gases consumed or produced by these
organisms, i.e. to investigate what types of atmospheric
gascompositions could suggest the presence of life on
extra-terrestrial worlds. Studies have shown growth
of unicellular prokaryotes and eukaryotes under condi-
tions found on other planets, like the H2 dominated
atmosphere of rocky exoplanets, so the potential for
experimental evolution is present. Questions of main
interest:
What are the key traits that evolve when life adapts
to non-earth like conditions and what is the nature
ofthe underlying mutations? What are the biosigna-
tures foundas a consequence of the evolution of new
traits? Are they unique signatures of life? The 2 PhD
positions are available for 4 years. A 50 % technician
is available to support the work. Salary ca 3,000 CHF

PhD opportunity at the University of Glasgow fully
funded for UK residents (stipend, tuition fees, research
budget).
Supervisors: Prof Kathryn Elmer Prof Maureen Bain
PhD project summary: Reproduction is key to the phys-
iology, development, and life history of animals and
the biological bases are deeply shared across amniotes.
Viviparity has evolved more than 100 times in mam-
mals and reptiles and its evolutionary novelty is how
mothers modulate duration of pregnancy and reduc-
tion in ospring number. These are presumed to be
genetic but are also aected by proximate and long-
term environmental context. To date, experiments to
deconstruct environmental from intrinsic and extrinsic
genetic components of female reproductive investment
were not possible and therefore the molecular basis of
pregnancy duration and its evolution is not known.
In this project we will identify genetic determinants
of reproductive investment and pregnancy duration,
including partitioning the inuence of maternal vs
paternal eects. This is uniquely possible using an
emerging model organism for amniote live-bearing
- the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara. We will
quantify the variation in gestation time using a
combination of developmental biology and genetic
approaches. Further, we will use genome-wide pedigrees
to determine the contribution of paternal genetic
variation on i) maternal reproductive strategies and ii)
ospring investment and outcome. The experiments
will involve new eld collections, microscopy and
developmental biology, and genomic analyses for high
resolution parentage reconstruction. Demonstrating
the genetics of reproductive timing and investment is
key to identifying how major changes in reproductive
mode occur, resolving genetic and evolutionary con-
icts between sexes and generations, and improving
knowledge of inuences to pregnancy outcomes.

PlantVirusBioinformatics
The Evolutionary (Meta-)genomics group in the Bioin-
formatics Group at Wageningen University invites ap-
plications for a bioinformatics PhD student in 'Virus
diversity and evolution in natural plant ecosystems'.
You might share our view that wild plant communities
might act as viral reservoirs that are also connected to
agricultural plants. Since viruses can spill over from
natural to agricultural systems, it is highly relevant to
characterize virus diversity in wild plants. Plant virus
genomes are highly diverse and evolve rapidly. To know
which role plant viruses play in shaping natural plant
communities, we must characterize their biodiversity
and evolution.34 EvolDir June 1, 2022
You might be familiar with the phenomenon that plant
virus infections are often asymptomatic, i.e., they do not
cause overt disease, and can even be benecial for the
host. Recently, plant virus research expanded from the
study of individual virus-host systems into characteriz-
ing global diversity using metagenomics, i.e., sequencing
the genetic content of environmental samples without
the need for prior virus isolation. Metagenomics led
to the surprising observation that virus infections are
ubiquitous, that there is a high incidence of mixed infec-
tion, and that most plant viruses identied in crops also
occur in wild plants. There is growing evidence that
viruses can impact plant ecosystems, which calls for a
reappraisal of the role of viruses in natural ecosystems
and accentuates the need to understand virus genomes
and their function and evolution.
The aim of this project is to develop bioinformatics meth-
ods to analyze plant virus metagenome data that has
been sampled from wild plants in the Netherlands. This
(and potentially your) project will contribute to under-
standing plant virus diversity and evolution in natural
Dutch ecosystems. You will contribute to developing
bioinformatics methods to discover and reconstruct virus
genomes from high-throughput plant virus sequencing
data and to analyze ecological and evolutionary proper-
ties of these viruses. To this end, we aim to analyze the
eect of host range and mixed infections on intra-host
diversity and estimate how recombination and selection
impact virus genome evolution.
Beyond the scientic and potentially application merits,
you will build a wide network for your future careerboth within and outside Wageningen University.
The research is embedded within the chair group of
Bioinformatics at Wageningen University which is led by
Prof. Dick de Ridder (https://www.bioinformatics.nl/).
You will be supervised by Dr. Anne Kupczok (https://-
annecmg.github.io/). The research will be carried out in
close collaboration with Dr. Mark Zwart at the Nether-
lands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) (https://-
nioo.knaw.nl/nl/employees/mark-zwart). The position
is for four years and funded by the graduate school Ex-
perimental Plant Sciences (https://www.graduateschool-
eps.info/).
We ask - a successfully completed MSc degree in bioin-
formatics or a related eld; - excellent background in
high-throughput sequencing analysis and comparative
genomics; - anity with ecology, evolution, and popu-
lation genomics; - interest in close collaborations with

Clermont France 5yr Eco-Evolution
Announcement: 5 years Position in Eco-Evolution
The Laboratoire Micro-organismes: Genome et Environ-
nement (UMR-CNRS 6023 LMGE, Clermont Auvergne
University) seeks to ll a 5 year position to developp
research at the interface of Ecology and Evolution in
the eld of microbial aquatic ecology, at the interface of
the environment and human health.
https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Ores/CPJ/CPJ-2022-018/-
Default.aspx?Lang=EN
Context The position aims at strengthening the syner-
gies between evolutionary ecology and functional ecology
to investigate, understand and quantify the functioning
of our environments under multiple constraints (climatic
and anthropic) and predict their evolutions in the con-
text of two major societal challenges: Climate Change
and Health & Environment.
The Lab Focussing on the microbial compartment, the
LMGE (Micro-organisms: genome and environment)
consists in the association of competences from the lev-
els of genomics and post-genomics to population and
ecosystem to investigate the relationships between en-
vironmental changes and the dynamic of communities
diversity to better understand microbial processes that
govern the functioning and sustainability of our environ-
ment. Our approach aims at bringing together genome,
environment and health, by putting the concepts and
tools of genomics and post-genomics at the service of sci-
entic questions related to the functioning of ecosystems
and health ecology. The scientic strategy of the unit
is built around 3 main scientic elds: (i) parasitism
and microbial ecosystems, (ii) trophic and functional
ecology, (iii) health ecology and ecotoxicology.
Within the lab, the research activities of the MEB team
focusses on the dynamics and structuring of microbial
assemblages in aquatic ecosystems, their functional in-
teractions over space and time and their emerging prop-
erties within ecosystems. To achieve this goal, we use
environmental genomics (e.g. metagenomic coupling,
single cell genome, metatranscriptomic, culturomic) and
bioinformatics.Scientic projet The recognition that evolutionary pro-
cesses can occur on time scales as short as ecological
processes, promotes the development of integrative ap-
proaches coupling ecological and evolutionary dynamics,
in times of marked environmental change and loss of
biodiversity on a planetary scale, which strongly aects
multiple dimensions of both ecological and evolutionary
dynamics, with repercussions on resilience, conserva-
tion and management of populations, communities and
ecosystems. The applicant will develop such an integra-
tive approaches, through the analyzes of their reciprocal
retroactions, in the context of lake ecosystem function-
ning in link with climate changes or at the interface of
the environment and human health.
Teaching project The recruited candidate will be in-
volved in teaching units combining Ecology and Evo-
lution, covering topics in link with i) adaptations of
aquatic organisms to their environments, ii) Emergence
and diusion of pathogenic microorganisms, iii) Ge-
nomics of microbial communities iv) Bioinformatics and
integrative omics.
Do you recognize yourself in the job prole? Please
contact us for further discussion to built a convincing
scientic project.

Mammalogist Survey
Good Afternoon,
If you are a former member of the American Society of
Mammalogists (ASM), please ll out the survey below.
The Membership Committee of the ASM wants
to understand the reasons that some society mem-
bers decide to join for one or a few years before
deciding not to renew their membership. We
would also like to know what the Society could
do dierently to retain members or increase our
membership. To help us understand these reasons,
we are asking former ASM members to complete
this survey: https://fhsucahss.co1.qualtrics.com/-

MolEcolPrize Nominations Jun06
deadline
Nominations for the Molecular Ecology Prize: We are
soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular Ecology
Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scien-
tic society, so there is no body that actively promotes
the discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial
board of the journalMolecular Ecologytherefore created
the Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void,
and recognize signicant contributions to this area of
research. The prize selection committee is independent
of the journal and its editorial board.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to molecular ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previous
winners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf, Louis Bernatchez,
Nancy Moran, Robin Waples, Scott Edwards, Victoria
Sork, and Fuwen Wei.
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words (longer submissions
will not be accepted) and the candidate's CV directly to
Anne Yoder (anne.yoder@duke.edu) by Monday, June 6,
2022. Organized campaigns to submit multiple nomina-
tions for the same person are not necessary and can be
counterproductive. Also, note that nominations fromJune 1, 2022 EvolDir 55
previous years do not roll over.

Seminar ESEB STN Speciation
May10
Dear colleagues,
A reminder that the next session of the monthly on-
line seminar series organised by the ESEB-funded STN
networkIntegration Of Speciation research ( [
https://speciation-network.pages.ist.ac.at/ ] ) will be
held on Tuesday 10th of May 2022, 5 pm CET.
The upcoming session is the second in a series of three
addressing the general topic of how to understand the
relative importance of dierent barriers to gene ow and
outline best practices to measure them, with a focus on
phenotypes and traits.
This session will focus on \The role of geography in
generating reproductive isolation". We will welcome as
speakers Clarisse Palma-Silva (University of Campinas,
Brazil) and Rosemary Gillespie (University of California,
Berkeley, USA).
The session will last 1.5 hours, with the rst hour dedi-
cated to talks from our speakers followed by questions.
The last half-an-hour is dedicated to a more general
discussion.
To attend the session live, please follow the link on our
website: https://speciation-network.pages.ist.ac.at/-
seminar-series/ . Talks (but not the discus-
sion session) are recorded and made avail-
able here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/-
UClEkDdE 5sDw70SQq78DIAA . The IOS network
does not only aim at scientic integration, but also
integration of the community. A main objective on this
front is to foster diversity and inclusion across the eld.
The seminar series and subsequent discussion is open
to everyone, from students to established researchers
and non-scientists alike. In order to maximise the
geographic diversity of attendees, we will alternate
between two time slots every other month: 5 pm CET
and 9 am CET. Please help us to circulate this email
to anyone who may be interested, especially those
in countries that are typically underrepresented in
scientic discourse.The programme of the seminar series is announced by
email, on Twitter (@Speciation net) and on the IOS
network website. People who wish to automatically
receive the programme and other news from the IOS
network can sign up to the network mailing list from
the IOS website.
We look forward to seeing you there!

and Access) task force, aims to address all forms of
exclusion in our society. With this in mind, a budget of
up to $25,000 per year will be dedicated to initiatives
that help reduce inequities in molecular biology and
evolution research. The task force would therefore like
to invite members of SMBE to propose initiatives that
would take place in the year 2022/2023. Examples of ini-
tiatives could include, but are not limited to, workshops,
symposia, training opportunities, stand-alone featured
talks, or inequity data collection in particular groups,
countries, or regions (to name a few).

EvolutionaryBiology
Dear Colleagues,
We are conducting a survey of ecological scientists that
participate in research to gauge their attitudes and per-
ceptions towards the dierent sectors of their ecological
research community. Our target audience includes evo-
lutionary biologists, population biologists, systematists,
etc and hence we would love to hear from you!
Have you heard opinions about which sector of your
ecological research community is the most productive
or impactful? Or which sector produces the highest
quality research? Is it academia, government, industry,
or the not-for-prot sector? Our survey aims to collect
data to explore if any of these claims, among others, are
justied. The results of our survey will be paired with
scientic publication data to assess if peoples attitudes
and perceptions of dierent sectors of their ecological
research community match objective publication met-
rics. The results of our research will be published as
one or more scientic journal articles.
The survey can be found here https://-
www.surveymonkey.com/r/MVXRY7Y, it takes a
maximum of 10 mins to complete and we would very
much appreciate if you could take the time to complete
it.
Lastly, we would also greatly appreciate it if you could
distribute our survey amongst your networks, to ecolog-
ical scientists that participate in research.
Thank you for engaging with our survey and our re-
search.
Kind regards and best wishes,
Pat

CityTech NewYork LizardGeneFlow
The Blair lab at NYC College of Technology (City
Tech/CUNY) focuses on using genomic data and so-
phisticated computational methods to understand evo-
lutionary patterns and elucidate the processes giving rise
to such patterns. Specic areas of focus include popula-
tion genomics, molecular phylogenetics, phylogeography,
species delimitation, and DNA barcoding. The lab is
currently seeking a postdoctoral scholar who will work
on an NSF funded project that uses multiple species
of phrynosomatid lizards to understand the inuence
of gene ow during the diversication of arid-adapted
organisms distributed throughout the major deserts of
western North America. A second major goal of the
project is to combine genomic data, mtDNA, morphol-
ogy, and ecology to rene species limits and describe
new taxa. Data will be collected from approximately
10 species/species complexes from multiple phrynoso-
matid genera. This project is a collaborative eort with
researchers from multiple institutions with expertise in
genomics, phylogenetics, and morphological analysis.
The successful candidate will be given some degree of
exibility to explore related interests within the overall
scope of the project. The initial appointment is for
one year, with the possibility of a second year given
satisfactory progress. Although the PIs laboratory is in
NYC, there will be some exibility regarding the loca-
tion of postdoctoral position. However, the successful
candidate must be able to periodically spend time in
NYC to perform laboratory work and potentially assist
in the eld throughout the western US.

EvolutionaryGenomics
A 24-month postdoctoral position in evolutionary ge-
nomics at CNRS (French National Center of Scientic
Research) is available.
Location: lab Ecology and Biology of Interactions (UMR
7267 EBI), Poitiers, France. Team \Ecology Evolution
Symbiosis" (EES).
Starting date: September 1st, 2022. Applications are
welcome from now on until the position is lled.
Funding: ANR project \SymChroSex" led by Jean Pec-
coud.
Project title: Evolutionary genomics of a neo sex chro-
mosome derived from a feminizing endosymbiont
Context: The mechanisms leading to the appearance of
new sex chromosomes and the genes controlling sex in
are unknown in most bisexual taxa. Thus, the origin
and turnover of genetic determinants of sex are still mys-
terious. Woodlice (terrestrial isopod crustaceans) are
prime models to ll this gap. Their sex chromosomes
are undierentiated (homomorphic) and heterogamy
systems (XY, ZW) vary between related species. The
dynamic evolution of sex determinants in these species
may result in part from the action of feminizing endosym-
biotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia. The common
woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare is a particularly in-
teresting result to this evolution (Cordaux et al. 2011,
Trends Genet.). In addition to Wolbachia, this species
comprises, depending on the population: one pair of
ZW-type sex chromosomes, another pair of XY-type sex
chromosomes, and a fascinating feminizing element thatarose from an insertion of the bulk of the Wolbachia
genome into the nuclear genome (Leclercq et al. 2016,
PNAS). This element, called the \f-element", feminizes
its carrier in the manner of a W chromosome. Although
it is of very recent origin, the f-element is already com-
mon in natural populations. The f-element is the focus
of the SymChroSex project.
This project aims to: (i) characterize the f-element in
terms of sequence, (ii) understand its origin and charac-
terize its evolution in natural populations, (iii) locate
the specic feminizing gene it contains, a gene probably
derived from Wolbachia whose feminization mechanism
is still unknown.
Missions: Working closely with Jean Peccoud, the post-
doc will conduct tasks aimed at meeting these objectives.
She/he will have access to important genomic resources
(pacbio, ONT, Hi-C) to contribute to the new genome
assembly of A. vulgare, in particular the f-element, and
to analyze the transmission patterns of the f-element
in controlled crosses. She/he will conduct population
genomics analyses (including eld samplings) to under-
stand the origin and rapid rise of the f-element (search
for selective sweep signals) and to locate the feminiz-
ing gene of the f-element (and potentially other sex
determinants (ZW, XY)). Depending on the anities
of the recruited person, other areas of research may be
explored, such as modeling the evolution of the dierent
sex-determining elements in natural populations and
gene expression analyses of candidate feminizing genes.
Requirements: PhD in the eld of evolutionary genomics,
Deep understanding of evolutionary concepts, more
specically population genetics, Skill in phylogenetic
and genomic analyses, Skills in bioinformatics tools and
scripting (bash, R), Ability to perform basic molecular
analyses (DNA extraction, PCR), Excellent abilities in
data analyses, writing, communication, teamwork and
creativity.
Monthly net salary: between 2200 euro and 2450 euro
according to experience.
All applications must be sent by email to Jean Peccoud
(jean.peccoud@univ-poitiers.fr). They must include a
CV, explain the motivations of the applicant and the
adequacy with the prole sought. The names and email
addresses of at least two referees are required.

The Institute
The Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) is an in-

Barcelona, Spain, with more than 400 scientists from
44 countries. The CRG is composed of an interdisci-
plinary, motivated and creative scientic team which is
supported both by a exible and ecient administration
and by high-end and innovative technologies.
In November 2013, the Centre for Genomic Regulation
(CRG) received the 'HR Excellence in Research' Award
from the European Commission. This is in recogni-
tion of the Institute's commitment to developing an HR
Strategy for Researchers, designed to bring the practices
and procedures in line with the principles of the Euro-
pean Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct
for the Recruitment of Researchers (Charter and Code).64 EvolDir June 1, 2022
The Role
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join
the 'Evolutionary Processes Modeling' group. We use
computational analysis of sequencing data together with
population genetics predictions and statistical modeling
to answer questions about mutational processes and
selective pressures in cancer cells and in the human pop-
ulation. The ideal candidate should be highly motivated
and eager to work on evolutionary and biological prob-
lems through the use and development of computational
and statistical approaches.
About the Group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population genet-
ics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity. Our
group is particularly interested in how the evolution and
survival of cancer cell populations relies on mutation
inux as well as in selection inference from observed
mutation data. To this end, we develop mathemati-
cal and computational approaches to estimate muta-
tion rates and selection. Coding sequences of cancer
tumors not only exhibit positively selected mutations
that drive cancer (www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-
0572-y), but there also exists a small fraction of genes
that the tumor cannot aord to lose (www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3987). In addition to genes, cancer driver
loci can occur in the non-coding part of the genome
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00100-x). Esti-
mates of the strength of selection in cancer allow for a
prioritization of genes and non-coding regions by their
disease relevance, with the ultimate goal of promoting
therapeutic advances.
We are also interested in mutation rates and selection
inference in the context of human genetic variation,
including polymorphisms (http://www.nature.com/-
articles/ng.3831; academic.oup.com/mbe/article-
abstract/36/8/1701/5475505) and de novo variants
(www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17162-z). Here,
a particular focus of the group lies on the description
of purifying selection in humans and across species,
accounting for mutational processes as well as the
eects of genetic drift.
The Evolutionary Processes Modeling lab was estab-
lished in October 2018 and is part of the 'Bioinfor-
matics and Genomics' program at the CRG. Further
information can be found at https://weghornlab.net/
and at www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/weghorn-

Kevin Parsons and Colin Selman in collaboration with
James Windmill (Strathclyde University), Bjarni Krist-
jansson (Holar University) and Brian Metscher (Vi-

We aim to investigate stickleback populations from
geothermally-warmed habitats and how they have
evolved and metabolically adapted to this challenging en-
vironment. So far, our investigations suggest that these
populations exhibit phenotypic variation in line with
the symptoms of metabolic syndrome (including dia-

This includes evolutionary divergence in appetite levels,
body composition, and glucose tolerance. The project
will leverage these ndings as well as wealth of exist-
ing genomic data to determine the mechanistic basis of
these traits. However, this project will also embrace the
reality that these populations are exposed to environ-
mental variation which will be considered throughout
our experiments.
The successful candidate should ideally have a back-
ground in one of evolutionary biology, genomics, molec-
ular biology, animal physiology or developmental biology
and will be expected to contribute to experiments and
the formulation and submission of research publications
as well as helping to manage and direct this project as
opportunities allow. The successful candidate will also
possess teamwork skills as they will work with a full-

LEMAR MARBEC France
PopulationGenomics
Post-doctoral project: Population genomics of common
dolphins in the NE Atlantic
A 30-months post-doctoral position in population ge-
nomics is open at the University of Western Brittany
as part of the DELMOGES program. The objective of
the post-doctoral project is to evaluate the population
structure of common dolphins in the Bay of Biscay and
adjacent regions by using SNPs obtained through RAD
sequencing, and using an eDNA approach. The hired
post-doc will be spending the rst 18 months at the
LEMAR research unit located in Plouzan e (RADseq
approach), and the last 12 months at the MARBEC
research unit in Montpellier (eDNA approach).
Scientic context: Since the 1990s, signicant dolphin
mortality events have occurred during the winter in
the Bay of Biscay, which result in stranding peaks on
the French Atlantic coast. During these events, most
stranded dolphins on this stretch of coast are com-
mon dolphins (Delphinus delphis), which present marks
caused by shing gear, indicating these dolphins were
incidentally caught. Over time, this level of incidental
catch could constitute a signicant threat to the com-
mon dolphin population in the northeastern Atlantic.
The DELMOGES program aims at providing knowledge
(from ecological data to management strategies) that is
necessary to remedy the issue of common dolphin by-
catch. One of the rst fundamental questions that must
be addressed, is the existence of distinct populations in
neritic versus oceanic zones. With that aim, the post-
doctoral project will evaluate population structure using
two approaches: 1) by analyzing SNPs obtained through
RADseq, using tissue samples collected from recently
stranded neritic dolphins and biopsy samples collected
in the oceanic zone of the Bay of Biscay, and 2) by
developing non-invasive sampling strategies to delimit
and study observed populations (eDNA approach using
ltered seawater collected during the biopsy campaign).
Post-doctoral project: At the LEMAR, the hired post-
doc will be in charge of DNA extractions, molecular
sexing of biopsied dolphins, RAD library preparation,
bioinformatic analysis of RADseq data using a calcula-
tion cluster, analyses of SNPs to evaluate population
structure, and writing a scientic publication synthetiz-
ing the results. During his/her year at MARBEC, thepost-doc will analyze eDNA sequences targeting pre-
viously dened SNPs obtained in the rst part of the
project. For this work, the post-doc will also use a
calculation cluster for bioinformatic analyses and will
investigate the relevance of using an eDNA approach in
this type of population genomic study. The post-doc
will be in charge of writing a publication or a report on
this second approach.
Candidate prole: Appointment to a post-doctoral po-
sition requires that the applicant has a PhD, or an
international degree equivalent to a PhD, within the
subject of the position, at the time for employment deci-
sion. The candidate must have a strong background in
population genomics and bioinformatics. Experience in
genomic library preparation would be a plus but is not
required. Knowledge in the management of protected
marine species would also be appreciated.
Working place: The postdoc will be located at the
LEMAR (Laboratory of Environmental Marine Sciences)
during the rst 18 months. The LEMAR is situated
within the IUEM (European Institute for Marine Stud-
ies) of the University of Western Brittany. The IUEM
is located in Plouzan e, about 8km away from the center
of Brest. The LEMAR is an interdisciplinary laboratory
that gathers a total of ca. 150 researchers and techni-
cians and 50 PhD students. The LEMAR includes a
molecular ecology lab, with all the necessary equipment
to conduct basic labwork (DNA extraction, PCR ampli-
cation, etc..) and to construct DNA libraries. The last
year of the project will be spent at the MARBEC labo-
ratory. The postdoc will benet from the experience in
eDNA analysis of the team at MARBEC, and from the
bioinformatic infrastructure from Ifremer. Both French
and English are used as spoken languages in the two
laboratories.
Salary: The salary is 1917 euro /month net and 46
days-o/year.
Application: The application must include: 1) a cover
letter presenting the research interests and relevant ex-
perience of the applicant (max. 2 pages), 2) a curricu-
lum vitae including the list of publications, 3) copies
of academic diplomas, and 4) the names and e-mail ad-

Norwich Bioinformatics
Postdoctoral Research Scientist (Bioinformatics)
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Researcher
to join the Laboratory of Dr Falk Hildebrand at the Earl-
ham Institute & Quadram Institute based in Norwich,
UK.
The Hildebrand group is researching microbial communi-
ties, specically interested in decoding the diversity, com-
munity interactions, and evolution of pro- and eukaryotic
microbes. The group develops and maintains various
metagenomics software tools (see www.falk.science).70 EvolDir June 1, 2022
Background:
How quickly can microbes adapt to newly colonized
environments?
The Hildebrand group develop tools to reconstruct novel
species and delimit even closely related strains. These
enable mapping the gut microbial persistence, disper-
sal and evolution of microbes in microbial communities
(doi:10.1016/j.chom.2021.05.008) or the relative distribu-
tion of fungi & bacteria (doi: 10.1111/1462-2920.15314)
in thousands of metagenomes. However, past work
often pointed to the crucial impact of the bacterial
pan genomes and species interactions in communities
(doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0386-6, 10.1136/gutjnl-2018-
317715). These are often captured at insucient quality
with the current generation of sequencing platforms &
metagenomic tools (doi: 10.1128/mSystems.00881-21).
The role:
In both human gut and soil microbiomes, typically hun-
dreds to thousands of microbial species can be found.
By all accounts, their genome architecture seems to
be incredibly dynamic, with genes frequently lost or
introduced. This process is part of the constant adap-
tion to the microbe's environment. To understand
such processes better, the postholder will develop novel
pipelines in metagenomics, that can automatically com-
bine data from PacBio, single cell and Hi-C sequencing.
This will enable ultra-resolution metagenomics and be
used for comparative genomics based on thousands of
metagenomes.
This post will therefore require a highly motivated
and experienced bioinformatician, with an interest
to compare microbial genomes reconstructed from
metagenomes. For this, existing pipelines will be
adapted and new pipelines implemented. Datasets the
candidate will conduct research are diverse, e.g. gut
metagenomes or soil metagenomes. These will be se-
quenced using 2nd and 3rd generation sequencing plat-
forms and advanced protocols, such as illumina, PacBio,
ONT, Hi-C & single cell sequencing data. The analysis
will be published in research papers that the candidate
should be leading.
The ideal candidate:
Candidates should have a PhD in Bioinformatics or
related eld, with experience in either: metagenomics,
population genetics, comparative genomics (eukaryotic
or prokaryotic), binning algorithms, single cell sequenc-
ing and/or sequencing technologies. The candidate will
work independently, with other group members, and
with national and international collaborators to gener-
ate and analyse data.Previous experience in publishing scientic results as
well as bioinformatics expertise are essential. An interest
in community microbiology (such as gut microbiome),
genetics and evolution will be advantageous, but prior
experience or knowledge of metagenomics is not a re-
quirement. Good organisational skills and the ability to
communicate and work productively within a multidis-
ciplinary team will be crucial. Training will be available
for multiple aspects of the work.
Additional information:
Salary on appointment will be within the range 32,578
to 39,938 per annum depending on qualications and
experience.This is a full-time post for a contract of 3
years.

The Schenk Lab at Ohio University is looking for a Post-
doctoral Researcher to start an NSF Funded project
in August 1st 2022. The position will be in person in
Athens, Ohio for two years and includes travel support
for research and conferences.
Brief Project Overview: Flowers have experienced ex-June 1, 2022 EvolDir 71
traordinary morphological changes through evolutionary
time that includes multiple origins of novel, non-fertile
structures. Because owers are a complex network of
interconnected parts, they provide an ideal system for
studying integrated-trait evolution in response to func-
tional cooption. We are investigating coopted oral
structures called staminodes, which are sterile stamens
that can perform novel functions, such as nectar produc-
tion, pollinator attraction, or enhanced pollen dispersal
or deposition. Staminodes provide an exceptional op-
portunity for revealing the evolutionary consequences of
functional cooption in an integrated system. The project
will study staminodes in Mentzelia (Loasaceae) to an-
swer the question: Is there an evolutionary response to
compensate for the loss of reproductive function when
a structure is coopted to perform a novel function?
Research tasks: The postdoctoral research associate will
be expected to conduct experiments, including genomic
library preparation and sequencing, phylogenomics, phy-
logenetic comparative approaches, morphological char-
acterization of oral traits, oral manipulation exper-
iments with natural pollinators, and eld work in the
western U.S. The successful candidate will have the op-
portunity to attend and present work in national and
international meetings and publish research results. The
postdoctoral research associate will co-mentor under-
graduate students and collaborate with a Ph.D. student,
research associates, and the PI.
Qualications: The Postdoctoral Scholar must have
earned their Ph.D. in Botany, Biology, or a closely re-
lated eld before August 2022. Successful candidates are
preferred to have research experience in plant evolution,
phylogenetic comparative approaches, oral morphology
and evolution, and/or pollinator ecology.
Application process: Please submit a cover letter that
outlines your previous research experiences, CV, contact
information (name, phone number, email, and mailing
address) for three professional references, and one publi-

will work with Dr James Borrell and Dr Philippa Ryan
at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in collaboration with
Prof Dorian Fuller at the Institute of Archaeology, Uni-
versity College London.
Enset is a giant perennial herb that provides the sta-
ple food for 20 million people, but outside of Ethiopia,
this remarkable banana relative is virtually unknown.
Like many tropical clonal crops, which tend to preserve
poorly in the archaeological record, enset's domestica-
tion history is poorly understood. Yet today we observe
over a thousand unique landraces, many with traits
specialised for disease tolerance, taste, co-products and
other useful attributes.
The successful applicant will make a major contribution
to understanding how farmers selected and cultivated
this diversity, and over what time period, helping to
unravel the mystery of enset domestication. This has
signicant applications in supporting the adaptation of
enset and other clonal crops to climate change. The
successful applicant will also form part of a vibrant,
dynamic and cross disciplinary scientic environment,
with access to Kew's state-of-the-art laboratory facilities
and opportunities to develop professional skills for the
next stage of their career. This role coincides with a
major new collaboration between Kew and the UCL
Institute of Archaeology as we apply novel approaches
combining genomics and archeobotany.
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in genomics or
a related discipline, together with a strong interest in
crop evolution and domestication and a track record of
research publications commensurate with their career
stage. They will be excited at the opportunity to inte-
grate archeobotanical evidence (e.g. phytoliths, macro
remains) from sites across the Ethiopian highlands, to-
gether with environmental and cultural diversity data
to help parameterise genomic models. They will also be

access to Kew's state-of-the-art laboratory facilities and
opportunities to develop professional skills for the next
stage of their career. With a major new investment in
this area, this is an exciting time to join the team.
The UK has committed to establishing 30,000 ha of
new woodland annually by 2050. We know that genetic
diversity underpins the resilience and future adaptive
potential of our tree populations, and that maintaining
this diversity is a key goal of the UK Forest Genetic
Resources strategy. However, as we move towards am-
bitious aorestation goals, there is a major knowledge
gap around the resulting genetic diversity in planted
versus naturally colonised woodlands and how this will
inuence resilience to environmental change, pests and
diseases.
Where we rely on tree planting for large-scale aoresta-
tion, a signicantdanger is that commercial seed collec-
tion, germination, nursery cultivation and/or planting
inadvertently introduces genetic bottlenecks or selec-
tionat one or more life stages. On the other hand,
maximising germination and survival through the pro-
vision of highly favourable growing conditions during
nursery production could result in more diverse popula-
tions, which through natural selection are better able to
keep pace with emerging stressors. This project seeks to
provide key evidence to address this knowledge gap and
feed in to best practice for aorestation. The success-
ful candidate will hold a PhD in a relevant discipline,
with a track record of research commensurate with their
career stage. They will lead research seeking to under-
stand the population genetics of planted and naturally
colonised woodlands. They will also be condent with
developing sampling strategies, conducting eld and lab
work, bioinformatic analysis, and communicating their
research through publications and conferences.
This role will collaborate extensively with scientists at

makers via Defra. This position represents an exciting
opportunity to shape future tree planting strategies,
with policy implications both in the UK and interna-

Distribution and diversity of existing UK elm
trees (https://careers.kew.org/vacancy/postdoctoral-
research-associate-485419.html)
Since 1970 Dutch elm disease (DED) has killed an esti-
mated 60-100 million elms in Britain, with the fungal
pathogen O. novo-ulmi spread almost exclusively by two
species of Scolytus bark beetles which feed on healthy
elms andbut use dying elms as breeding material. Nowa-
days, few mature elms remain in the UK landscape
although rare old survivors do occur, some of which
mayhave natural eld resistance. Young elms regener-
ate constantly and tend to survive 10-20 years. This
means that the smaller vector beetle, S. multistriatus
can breed successfully but the larger S. scolytus may
have become scarce. However, there has been little
study of how beetle populations may have changed in
the past 30-40 years. Several breeding programmes in
Europe have crossed resistant Asiatic elms with Euro-
pean species to produce O. novo-ulmi resistant cultivars.
Pure U. minor clones taken from older trees that have
survived DED in Spain have been propagated. Many
of these putativelyresistance elms have been planted in
the UK.
The project aims to do the following: (1) Collect, review
and combine existing key data on resistant elm plantings
and older survivor elms in Britain into a single acces-
sible database and map. (2) Evaluate the durability
of already planted resistant elm cultivars under DED
pressure. (3) Establish the current presence and relative

StockholmU FungalAdaptation
Postdoc-position available at the Department of Ecology,
Environmental and Plant Sciences, Stockholm Univer-
sity
A postdoctoral research position in Fungal Biology is
available at the Department of Ecology, Environmental
and Plant Sciences, Stockholm University. This post-
doc oers an opportunity to explore fungal adaptation
to extreme environments. The postdoc-project can be
developed after the interest of the applicant, and may
involve genome analyses, degradation assays, lab and/or
eld experiments.
Motivation: Crude oil and petroleum products are of
specic concern in pollution studies due to their struc-
tural complexity, slow biodegradability, biomagnica-
tion potential, and the serious health hazards associated
with their release into the environment. Bioremedi-
ation, that makes use of natural microbial biodegra-
dation activity, constitute an attractive alternative to
physicochemical methods for restoration of PHC pol-
luted environments. By the study of fungal genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other
high-throughput methods, it is becoming increasingly
evident that fungi hold a wide array of characters mak-
ing them able to live in extreme environments. In this
project, we will investigate the microbial community
in the underground mining facility in Kiruna (Kiruna
underjordsgruva, KUJ), which is contaminated with pol-
lutants because of the use of petroleum products for
maintenance of machinery. Isolates from the mine are
available in the laboratory, and these can be studies for
their degrading capacity and genomic adaptations.
The research will be conducted within the Johannesson
research group, within the Department of Ecology,
Environmental and Plant Sciences, Stockholm Uni-
versity. Johannesson group is currently moving to
Stockholm from Uppsala University, see the group-infohere: https://www.iob.uu.se/research/systematic-
biology/johannesson/ For more information about the
Department, see here: https://www.su.se/department-
of-ecology-environment-and-plant-sciences/about-the-
department Required qualications for applicants
are 1) a PhD in Biology, Genetics, Evolutionary
Biology, Genomics, Microbiology or related eld, 2)
experience in one or several of the following areas:
bioinformatics, biochemistry, microbiology, mycology,
and 3) demonstrated communication skills in English.
The position is a two-year scholarship, nanced from
Carl Trygger Foundation. Review of applications will
begin immediately and continue until the position is
lled.
To apply, send your CV, including contact informa-
tion for two references, and a cover letter stating
your research interest to: Dr Hanna Johannesson,

TheoryDensityDependence
Postdoc position: density-dependent selection theory
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna
Masel (http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel/-
people/joanna/) at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
The position is amenable to remote work, and eorts
will be made to accommodate all situations. That said,
collaboration with an in-Tucson Ph.D. student is ex-
pected, and Tucson is located in the biodiverse Sonoran
desert, surrounded on all four sides by mountainous
national and state parks, with an attractive climate
for most of the year. Stipend is at NIH rates, and the
cost of living in Tucson is relatively low. Start date is
negotiable; funding is secured through the end of July
2024.
The project is to model evolution not according to a uni-
tary concept of \tness", but according to a small set of
tness-associated traits designed to capture fundamen-
tal distinctions. Previous work in our lab made progress
on this for the case of competition for durable resources
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.11.006. We distin-
guished between absolute fecundity, relative competi-
tiveness of juveniles to secure territories needed to reach
adulthood, and absolute adult mortality. This catego-
rization captured dierences both in whether changes to
a trait changed population density, and whether changes
in density aected selection on the trait.
The postdoc's role will be to apply similar concepts to
consumable resources, including interference competi-
tion during which resources may grow to higher levels
than allowed for within Tilman's R* theory ecology.
Our aim is to produce a robust classication scheme for
tness-associated traits, providing a theoretical basis
both for density-dependent evolution, and for a res-
olution of the \Grime-Tilman" debate from ecology.
We also hope to incorporate plastic resource alloca-
tion strategies into the unied scheme. However, the
exact direction of the work depends on the postdoc's
interests. Our inclusion in a larger initiative https://-
www.biologicalpurpose.org/ oers opportunities for in-
terdisciplinary collaborations, especially with philoso-
phers.
Excellent mathematical modeling skills are required.
Prior knowledge of either theoretical population genetics82 EvolDir June 1, 2022
or theoretical ecology is preferred, but strong candidates
who have worked on other kinds of models will also be
considered.

Postdoc: Population genomics of pollack and red mullet
in NE Atlantic, using RAD sequencing
A 39 months Post-Doc is proposed at the University of
Brest, UBO (LEMAR laboratory) to perform a popula-
tion genomics study of two sh species of high commer-
cial interest in European sheries, the pollack, Pollachius
pollachius, and red mullet, Mullus surmuletus, in the
North-East (NE) Atlantic. A particular attention will
be paid to the population structure in the Bay of Biscay
and adjacent waters. This project is based on a collabo-
ration between UBO, the National Museum of Natural
History (MNHN), Ifremer, and professional shermen.June 1, 2022 EvolDir 83
Background and scientic context: The development
of relevant sheries management plans relies on the
accurate assessment of stock boundaries. In the Bay
of Biscay, the management of a certain number of ex-
ploited species, known as 'Data Poor Species', is largely
hampered by a signicant lack of knowledge concerning
their biology and ecology, notably concerning their pop-
ulation structure. This is particularly the case for the
pollack, Pollachius pollachius, and the red mullet, Mul-
lus surmuletus. In this context, a population genomics
study will be conducted to explore the spatio-temporal
structure of pollack and red mullet populations in the
Bay of Biscay and surrounding waters. With this aim, a
RAD-seq (Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing)
will be conducted on both species, which is highly rele-
vant to discover a sucient number of genetic variants
on non-model species, and in ne to evaluate ne-scale
structuring patterns in populations. These investiga-
tions will be combined with previous data obtained by a
Pool-Seq approach. About 700 individual pollack sam-
ples and 800 red mullet samples collected from Portugal
to northern Scotland are expected to be RAD-sequenced
individually. These samples include temporal samples
that cover a period ranging from 10 years (red mullet) to
20 years (pollack). Additional samples will be collected
in 2023 and added to the dataset.
Detailed post-Doc project: The Post-Doc will be in
charge of conducting the preparation of RAD libraries
and all analysis downstream to sequencing at LEMAR
laboratory. Sequencing will be conducted on external
platforms. Bioinformatic analysis will be conducted us-
ing a calculation cluster located at Ifremer (Datarmor).
This genomic study will aim at addressing two issues:
||| 1. Firstly, the population genetic structure of
both pollack and red mullet will be investigated over
the distribution range of both species from Portugal to
northern Scotland. The goal of this rst task will be to
assess the level of evolutionary divergence among the
populations of both species in their| Atlantic distri-
bution area. ||| 2. Secondly, genomic data will be
applied to assess connectivity patterns between the Bay
of Biscay and surrounding waters. A particular eort
will be conducted to apply genomic data to management
issues of both species in the Bay of Biscay.
Prole of the candidate: The candidate must have a
strong background in population genomics and bioin-
formatics. A signicant experience in DNA librairies
preparation (RAD-seq or other methods) will be ap-
preciated. In addition, the post-doc is expected to be
particularly interested into the application of population
genomics data in sheries management.
Working place: The post-doc will be hosted at Lab-
oratory of Environmental Marine Sciences (LEMAR;https://www-iuem.univ-brest.fr/lemar/?lang=en).
This laboratory is located in the European Institute
for Marine Studies (IUEM; https://www-iuem.univ-
brest.fr/?lang=en), which is a pluridiscisplinary
institute dedicated to the eld of marine and coastal
sciences. The IUEM is located in Plouzan e, about 8km
away from the center of Brest. The LEMAR is an
interdisciplinary laboratory that gathers a total of ca.
150 researchers and technicians and 50 PhD students.
The LEMAR includes a molecular ecology team, with
all the necessary equipment to conduct most of the
labwork (DNA extraction, PCR amplication, etc..)
and construct DNA libraries. Both French and English
are used as spoken languages in the laboratory.
Salary: The salary is 1 917,12 euro /month net and 47
days-o/year.
Application: This will include 1/ a cover letter present-
ing the research interests and relevant experience of
the applicant (max. 2 pages), 2/ a curriculum vitae
including the list of publications, 3/ copies of academic
diplomas, and 4/ the names and e-mail addresses of
tow referees. Applications should be sent as a single
pdf to gregory.charrier@univ-brest.fr. The deadline for
application is May 18, 2022. Short-listed candidates will
be interviewed on May 30th, 2022, in a visio-conference
mode.

Post-doc position in avian social evolution at the Centre
for the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior, Univer-
sity of Konstanz.
The Griesser lab invites application for a postdoctoral
position as part of a project at the interdisciplinary
Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior.
The project investigates the consequences of the inter-
play between individual and group social phenotype
in a wild bird species. Not only individuals but also
groups vary in their social phenotype. Although the
latter component is rarely considered, it is potentially
quite important: successful groups should be better at
coordinating their behaviours, e.g., during foraging or
predator encounters, and thus inuence the tness of
group members.
This project will investigate these links in a wild popu-
lation of Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaustus) in Swedish
Lapland, monitored since 1989. This bird species lives in
stable, enduring groups composed of a breeding pair and
up to 4 non-breeders, and we follow individuals in up to
90 groups throughout their life to collect life-history and
behavioural data. The project will combine eld experi-
ments with existing long-term data to investigate the
interplay between individual and group social phenotype,
and its consequences. A short description of our past
research can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/-
watch?v=JaH6wjAYAiE You will join the Griesser lab
and the interdisciplinary team at the Excellence Cluster
for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour at the
University of Konstanz. The position should begin 1st
July 2022 and will be fully funded for 22 months (salary
scale 13/3 TV-L).
Your qualications: - PhD in behavioural ecology, ecol-
ogy, evolutionary biology, or similar; - Field experience
of behavioural observations and experimental work; -
Bird handling experience (including mist netting); -
Highly motivated and sociable personality; - Project
management skills; - Ability to work both independently
and in a team; - Driver's license (manual transmission);
- Basic knowledge of X-country or downhill skiing is an
advantage.
Deadline: 18 ^th May 2022; application will be reviewed
as soon as received. Applications should be sent tomichael.griesser@uni-konstanz.de and include a short
motivation letter, a CV including publications, and

the origin, evolution, and mechanisms of action of a
supergene controlling social organization across Formica
ants (see http://www.unil.ch/dee/page7000.html). Re-
cent research showed that some species have three su-
pergene haplotypes. F. selysi and F. cinerea commonly
hybridize, raising the possibility of supergene introgres-
sion. The postdoctoral researcher will generate and
analyse population genomics data to uncover key pro-
cesses governing supergene evolution, including selection,
genetic load, drive and introgression. This project will
shed light on how supergenes arise, spread and shape
complex alternative phenotypes.
Your responsibilities: You will study the evolution of
a social supergene. This will involve eld sampling
of multiple ant species, population analyses (e.g. sex-
ratio, male production), sequencing, population genomic,

key determinant of many innate behavioral responses,
from aggression to parental care. A central goal of
our research is to understand how an animal's innate
interpretation of odors drives behavior, how this repre-
sentation evolves, and how genetic variation modulates
the neural architecture of odor information processing
in the mammalian olfactory system. We are seeking to
recruit a highly motivated post-doctoral fellow for an
interdisciplinary project at the interface between evolu-
tionary biology and neurobiology. The project focuses
on performing behavioral experiments in rodents and
proling the sensory responses to stimuli corresponding
to various ethological contexts using high-throughput se-
quencing approaches. The project will be conducted at
GIGA, a cross-disciplinary environment which will pro-
vide the candidate with ample possibilities to learn new
skills and methods ranging from imaging to single-cell
sequencing.
Work duties The main duties involved in this post-
doctoral position is to conduct research. Work duties
include: - Perform behavioral experiments and expose
animals to ethologically relevant cues. - Work in tight
collaboration with the GIGA Genomics platform to co-
ordinate the preparation and sequencing of samples. -
Work in collaboration with the GIGA Bioinformatics
platform to analyze Next-Generation Sequencing data.
- Actively contribute to a positive and creative working
atmosphere in the group. - Possibility to develop own
research questions within the project aims.

within the subject of the position, at the time for em-
ployment decision. The doctoral degree should have
been obtained no more than ve years before the last
date for applications. Extensions are possible under
certain circumstances such as childbirth and adoption.
Importantly, the candidate should be a situation of in-
ternational mobility: he/she should not have worked or
lived in Belgium for more than 24 months during the 3
years preceding his/her start date.
Additional requirements: - PhD certicate in a relevant
eld such as biology, neurobiology, evolutionary biol-
ogy. - Very good prociency in written and oral English.
- Good communication skills. - Ability to work well

UOtago LifeHistorySexualSelection
Seminal uid and life-history responses in mammals
This project seeks to test how seminal uid exposure
during mating inuences a female mammal's future fer-
tility and rate of ageing. Previous research from our
team has shown that female sexual experience, without
pregnancy, enhances fertility and growth but reduces
lifespan in mice. Other research in invertebrates and
humans suggests that seminal uid exposure could be
the cause of these long-lasting eects, which will be
directly tested in this project. The project will use a
number of approaches to manipulate exposure to semi-
nal uid during mating, assessing how this inuences the
gestational development of subsequent ospring, total
female fecundity and eects on ageing. Research in this
project will provide insight into how male seminal uid
proteins inuence female reproductive physiology and
tness, with relevance to both human fertility and the
evolutionary roles of these proteins in sexual selection
and conict
The Candidate is expected to have a background in
evolutionary biology, reproductive biology, ageing or a
related eld. It is expected that they will have experi-
ence working with rodents, or a very strong desire to
learn.
The student will be primarily supervised by Dr. Michael
Garratt, whose interests lie in understanding the links
between reproduction and ageing. They will be housed
within The Department of Anatomy at the University
of Otago, a department with diverse and complimentary
research interests. These interests include reproduction,
genomics, development, neuroscience, neuroendocrinol-
ogy, clinical anatomy and biological anthropology. The
University of Otago is located in the beautiful town of
Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand.

AarhusU GWAS and Prediction Jul
Hi All
In July 2022, Aarhus University is running a 5ECTs
course on Analysis of GWAS data with a Focus on Pre-
diction. The course is aimed at MSC and PhD students.
The deadline for registering is the end of May. The main
objectives are:
1 - teach students the methods being used to analyse
GWAS. These will include both basic analyses (e.g.,
quality control and single-SNP tests of association) and
advanced methods (e.g., heritability analyses).
2 - teach students how to construct prediction mod-
els (i.e., to be able to predict an individual's risk of
developing a disease, given their genetic information).
3 - teach students how to use popular genetic software.
At the end of the course, students should be able to:
1 - Explain the aims of a GWAS, and all the steps
required to perform a basic association analysis.
2 - Discuss how heritability analyses can be used to
improve our understanding of complex traits.
3 - Explain how prediction models are constructed and
used within personalized medicine.
The course involves classroom teaching from 4th to 8th
July, and then approximately two weeks working on an
assignment (to be submitted at the start of August).
Students must be in Aarhus for the classroom teaching
(AU will arrange accommodation), but will generally
complete the remainder of the course remotely.

Workshop: Integrating macro-ecology & macro-
evolution for biodiversity assessment
14-18 October 2022, at Schoodic in Maine
The workshop aims to connect across scales to under-
stand factors dictating patterns of biodiversity. We plan
to address a major gap in our eld, connecting large-
scale understanding of biodiversity at a given time pe-
riod in a spatially variable environment (macroecology)
with the understanding of how the integrated structure
of biodiversity changes through time (macroevolution).
What are the spatial and temporal drivers of biodiver-
sity, and what aspects impart resilience to perturbationssuch as those from invasive species or climate change?
The biggest challenge in studying biodiversity processes
is the spatial and temporal scales involved. However,
there are several research avenues emerging that demon-
strate ways to circumvent these limits, one theoretical
and three empirical. First, several modeling approaches
are under way that provide a predictive framework for
how communities might respond to change. The data to
test such models must come from communities in which
we can actually measure change through extended time
periods and large space. We have identied three such
areas: Paleobiology directly observes at the spatiotempo-
ral scales of biodiversity dynamics of macro-organisms;
island biogeography provides a stage where macroecol-
ogy plays out within islands and macroevolution plays
out between islands; and microbial ecology makes ex-
periments feasible at the spatiotemporal scales of bio-
diversity dynamics for those organisms. The workshop
will bring together researchers from these dierent dis-
ciplines, with the goals of explicitly modeling processes
that bridge macroecology and macroevolution. The
primary goal is to identify commonalities across sys-
tems to build a common framework and unied theory
of the processes that generate, maintain, and conserve
biodiversity and create resilience therein.
The meeting organizers are Rosemary Gillespie, Michael
Hickerson, and Brian McGill, together with Luke Har-
mon, Oskar Hagen, Stephanie Kivlin, Evan Economo,
and Jessica Blois. An additional 15 scientists have been
invited to participate.
We encourage graduate students based in the US toap-

summer school course sponsored by the Werner Siemens
Foundation:*Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics*.
DATE AND SCHEDULE: Online from Monday 1st to
Friday 5th of August from 09:00 to 17:00 (CEST, Leipzig
time zone).
ORGANISERS: Dr. Christina Warinner (Harvard Uni-
versity, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthro-
pology) and James Fellows Yates (Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leibniz Institute for
Natural Product Research and Infection Biology Hans
Kn >1

COURSE OVERVIEW: Ancient metagenomics applies
cutting-edge metagenomic methods to the degraded
DNA content of archaeological and paleontological spec-
imens. The rapidly growing eld is currently uncovering
a wealth of novel information for both human and natu-ral history, from identifying the causes of devastating
pandemics such as the Black Death, to revealing how
past ecosystems changed in response to long-term cli-
matic and anthropogenic change, to reconstructing the
microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, as
the eld grows, the techniques, methods, and workows
used to analyse such data are rapidly changing and
improving.
In this *hands-on summer school (block praktikum)* >1
2
we will go through the main steps of ancient metage-
nomic bioinformatic workows, familiarising students
with the command line, demonstrating how to process
next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data, and showing
how to perform de novo metagenomic assembly. Focus-
ing on host-associated ancient metagenomics, the course
consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on ex-
ercises, allowing participants to become familiar with
the types of questions and data researchers work with.
Round table discussions with experts at each stage of
the workow will be held to allow participants to get
advice on their own projects and research.
By the end of the course, participants will have an un-
derstanding of how to eectively carry out the major
bioinformatic components of an ancient metagenomic
project in an open and transparent manner. Atten-
dees will be eligible for ECTS points (awarded by the
JSMC Graduate School, Friedrich-Schiller University,
Germany) or a certicate of completion (Max Planck -
Harvard Research Center, MHAAM).

registration is now open for the 3rd edition of the Intro-
duction to Deep Learning for biologists.
Dates: online, 26th-30th of September
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers,
and professionals interested in learning what deep learn-
ing is and how to develop a deep learning model for
applications in biology. It will include information useful
for both absolute beginners and more advanced users
willing to delve into some aspects of the implementation
of deep learning. We will start by introducing gen-
eral concepts of deep learning presenting a functioning
model and then we will progressively describe the main
building blocks of a deep learning model and how the
internal machinery works. Attendees are expected to
have a background in biology and the research problems
involving prediction, inference, and pattern discovery.
There will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practical
exercises using mainly Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and
the Linux command line. Some basic understanding of
Python programming and the Linux environment willbe advantageous but is not required.

ONLINE course \Population genomic inference from
low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data"
When: 10-13 October 2022
Instructors: Dr. Nina Overgaard Therkildsen (Cornell
University, US) Dr. Tyler Linderoth (University of Cam-
bridge, UK), Dr. Arne Jacobs (University of Glasgow,
UK) and Nicolas Lou (Cornell University, US)
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course64/ )
In this course, we will explore workows and the underly-
ing rationale behind producing, processing, and analyz-
ing low-coverage sequencing data for population genomic
inference. Given that most species have insucient refer-
ence data to allow reliable genotype imputation, we will
focus on genotype likelihood-based methodology that
can be applied to any system. We will primarily cover
methods and algorithms implemented in the ANGSD
software package and associated programs, providing
best-practice guidelines and discussion of how partic-
ipants can make maximal use of low-coverage whole
genome re-sequencing data for their studies.
The course is aimed at researchers who might have pre-
vious experience with next generation sequencing (NGS)
data (e.g. exome/RAD/pooled sequencing) and wish
to explore the potential for using low-coverage whole-
genome sequencing for their studies.
All hands-on exercises will be run in a Linux environ-
ment on remote servers. Statistical analyses and data
visualization will be run in R.

Online RADSeq Jun6-9
The University of Connecticut's Computational Biology
Core is oering a workshop on assaying genetic vari-
ation using restriction-associated DNA sequencing, or
RAD-Seq.
The workshop will cover basic concepts and walk
through a complete analysis on a high performance
computing cluster. The analysis will start with raw
reads and go through some very basic analyses of pop-
ulation genetic structure. The core learning goal is to
familiarize attendees with the steps necessary to gener-
ate, lter and compare variant call sets using RAD-seq
data, the tools available, common data formats and how
to convert between them, and possible pitfalls they may
encounter.
We'll use data collected from a landscape genetic study
of arctic grayling, a marine sh, using the ddRAD
method (Peterson et al. 2012). All code required to
complete the full analysis will be provided in a pub-
lic github repository, and sessions recordings will be
available to all participants after the workshop.
The workshop will take place over 4 days for 3-3.5 hours
each day.
Dates: June 6-9 2022 Time (ET): Day 1: 8:30am-
12:00pm, Days 2-4 9.00am - 12.00pm Location: On-
line Cost: $350/$483USD for UConn aliated/External
attendees.
Workshop schedule:
Day 1: Introduction to Linux/HPC Day 2: Introduction
to RADSeq, high throughput sequencing data, quality
control, read mapping Day 3: Reference-based and de
novo variant discovery approaches. Day 4: Manipulat-
ing, ltering, reformatting output les. Basic population
genomic analyses.

Online SeascapeGenomicsInR
Nov31-Oct4
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 3rd edition of the
Physalia course on \Seascape Genomics", which will
take place ONLINE from October 31st to November
4th.Instructors: Dr. Laura Benestan (CEFE-CNRS, FR)
and Oliver Selmoni (EPFL, CH).
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course70/ )
In this course, students will learn the basics of this ap-
proach and train using state-of-the-art methods. Firstly,
students will learn how to extract environmental data
from publicly available databases and how to use it to
characterize the seascape structure and conditions. For
instance, students will learn how to use remote sensing
data to describe seawater temperature oscillations or
seawater movements. Next, the course will focus on
genomic analyses: students will learn how to evaluate
genetic structures in the marine environment and calcu-
late and display connectivity between populations. The
combination of environmental and genomic data will
also lead to the study of local adaptation. Students
will learn dierent methods to discover genetic/genomic
signatures potentially involved in adaptation against
specic environmental constraints. The course will also
cover the critical task of the interpretation and valida-
tion of the results, particularly in an applied conserva-
tion and management context. Finally, the workshop
will consider the crucial aspects and good habits to ac-
count for designing a seascape genomics experiment (e.g.
sampling design) from a relevant scientic question.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.June 1, 2022 EvolDir 107
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
