**CALL FOR TALKS AND POSTERS**
If you are a post-graduate or post-doctoral student,
working on any aspect or evolutionary research, you
are welcome at our FREE, one day conference. If you
would like to present a talk or poster, please submit a
title and abstract (100-150 words) by 31st July 2006.
Talk slots are usually booked, so early submission will
increase chance of success. Contact Victoria Herridge
(<mailto:v.herridge@ucl.ac.uk >v.herridge@ucl.ac.uk)
or Emily Hornett ( <mailto:e.hornett@ucl.ac.uk >e.hornett@ucl.ac.uk)
to register and submit abstracts.
This years keynote speakers are Georgina Mace (Direc-
tor, Institute of Zoology) and Steve Mithen (Head of
the School of Human and Environmental Science, Uni-
versity of Reading).
Georgina Mace’s research is in conservation biology,
emphasising evolutionary, ecological and genetic as-4 EvolDir July 1, 2006
pects, for the formulation of conservation policy. She is
particularly interested in the assessment and manage-
ment of populations of threatened species, and in the
dynamics of extinction pressures.
Professor Steven Mithen’s research interests cover from
the origin of Homo c.2 million years ago to the in-
vention and spread of agriculture up to 5000 BC. His
projects fall into three areas: Late Pleistocene and
Early Holocene hunter-gatherers and early farmers, the
evolution of the human mind, and computational ar-
chaeology. He has directed ﬁeldwork in Western Scot-
land and is currently co-directing excavations in Wadi
Faynan, southern Jordan. His authored books include
The Prehistory of the Mind (1996) and After the Ice
(2003), and he has edited volumes on Human Creativ-
ity (1998) and Hunter-Gatherer Landscape Archaeol-
ogy (2001). Steve’s latest publication is The Singing
Neanderthals: The Origins of Music, Language, Mind
and Body.

siﬁcation to reproductive isolation.
The symposium is intended to be a conceptually and
taxonomically broad meeting, aimed to stimulate cross-
disciplinary discussions. The target of the symposium
will be the interface between genetic polymorphisms
and ecological genetics at the intraspeciﬁc level and upto the species level. We have invited a diverse group
of speakers representing diﬀerent research traditions,
organisms and approaches (theoretical as well as em-
pirical). This symposium is open also to researchers
and PhD-students from universities in Sweden as well
as those from other countries. For those who are inter-
ested, there will also be opportunities for short research
presentations (15 minutes), in addition to the plenaries.
Invited speakers:
Scott Armbruster (University of Portsmouth, UK)
Ulf Dieckmann (IIasa, Austria)
Kerstin Johannesson (Gothenburg University, Sweden)
Olle Leimar (Stockholm University, Sweden)

SUBMISSIONS: Successful submissions will be invited
for a 25-minute presentation, and the paper will be
printed in the conference proceedings, which will be
published by Springer in the “Lecture Notes in Bioin-
formatics” series.
Expanded versions of conference papers will be invited
for submission to a special issue of the Journal of Com-
putational Biology.
Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair sys-
tem. Submissions must be received in electronic form
by 11:59pm (Montreal local time) of June 9th, 2006.
Submissions should be no more than 12 single-spaced
A3 or A4 pages with 1.25-inch margins all around, ev-
erything included (title, authors, addresses, abstract,
references, ﬁgures, tables), in at least a 10-point font.
An optional short appendix may contain details or addi-
tional data to be consulted at the discretion of the pro-
gram committee. Note that authors of accepted papers
will have to reformat them for the proceedings using
the Springer LNCS style, which has even wider mar-
gins. It may save the authors’ some work if this format
is used from the outset. The submission must include
the corresponding author’s email address.
Papers submitted for review should represent original,

Triennial meeting of the Malacological Society of Aus-
tralasia
6 - 8 December 2006, University of Wollongong, NSW
plus two day pre and post conference workshops (4-5th
Dec, 9-10 Dec)
The objective of this meeting is to bring together stu-
dents, established researchers, naturalists and members
of government and NGO agencies that have an interest
in molluscs. The meeting will focus on current research
involving molluscs in the Australasian area.
Molluscs are the second largest animal phylum and
many are ecologically and economically important.
They are dominant organisms in marine environments
and have suﬀered more human-induced extinctions on
land and in freshwaters than seen in all tetrapod verte-
brates.
Themes:
* Applied studies (aquaculture, ﬁsheries, parasitology,
invasive species)
* Conservation and ecology (including endangered
species, indicator species, molluscs in experimental
ecology, tracking environmental changes)
* Systematics (including taxonomy, phylogeny, evolu-
tion, faunistics, biogeography)
* Genetics and development (population genetics,
evolution-development, larval development)
Venue: McKinnon Centre, University of Wollongong.
Wollongong is about 1.5 hrs by road or rail south of
Sydney. Details on other options for travel to Wol-longong from Sydney provided on the conference web-

megwebpageStud06.htm Fully Funded PhD Stu-
dentship on the Temporal and Spatial Population
Genetics of Roe Deer in the UK
The roe deer is one of only two deer species indige-
nous to the British Isles (the red deer is the other).
Known roe deer remains in Britain date back to the late
OIS 5 (about 100,000 years ago). They are numerous
in archaeological sites throughout Roman and Saxon
times, but suﬀered a steady decline during the medi-
aeval period. Protected by the Normans, they were
declared beasts of the warren (unworthy of noble hunt-
ing) in 1338. This led to extensive hunting, and by thelate 16th century they had become scarce throughout
England, and extinct in Wales, though populations sur-
vived in some areas of Scotland. The UK population
remained small (though how small is not known) until
a series of re-introductions into the Lake District, East
Anglia and southern England re-established the species
in England in the 19th century. The impact of rein-
troductions on native populations is poorly understood
in mammals, however this species provides an excellent
test case, given the long historical record and availabil-
ity of samples from all relevant time periods.
The project will involve the application of population
genetic analyses to modern and ancient roe deer sam-
ples to help address this question. The student should
have at least a 2.1 undergraduate degree result, and
preferably an MS degree in a related ﬁeld. The stipend
will be £12,000 per year, to cover tuition and living ex-
penses (note that this would be suﬃcient to cover all
expenses for UK and EU nationals, but not for overseas
students). Consumables costs are also fully funded.
Please send your c.v., a cover letter explaining why
you are well suited to this project, your undergraduate
and where relevant postgraduate course records, and ar-
range for three letters of reference to be sent to: Prof.
A. R. Hoelzel, School of Biological and Biomedical Sci-
ences, University of Durham, Durham, DH1 3LE,UK.
These materials should be preferably sent by email to
a.r.hoelzel@dur.ac.uk to arrive before 10 July (for a pre-
ferred starting date of Oct 2006). Applicants should
also complete the application form for postgraduate
studies, which can be downloaded from the Durham
University website.

RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP (PhD) POSITION
(50% RA) IN MOLECULAR ECOLOGY Funding
for a 3-year Ph.D. project is available through the
College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Re-
sources (CTAHR) in the Department of Tropical Plant
and Soil Sciences ( http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/-
ctahr2001/TPSS/Index.html ), to work on the develop-
ment of unique molecular markers for rapid identiﬁ-
cation of potentially invasive weeds in Hawaii. This
project aims to develop molecular markers to identify
invasive weeds from closely related and morphologically
similar desirable species. The objective is not necessar-
ily to identify species per se, but to develop procedures12 EvolDir July 1, 2006
to screen out certain samples of concerned species or
eliminate potential invasive species. The project also
presents an opportunity to use molecular population
genetic methods to address questions related to disper-
sal and gene ﬂow in invasive plants.
This is primarily a lab-based project, therefore, expe-
rience with molecular genetic methods and analyses
(e.g. PCR, gel electrophoresis, automated sequenc-
ing/genotyping) is desirable but not essential. The
candidate will work under supervision of Dr. Ania
Wieczorek ( http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/ctahr2001/-
TPSS/facultystaﬀ/proﬁles/wieczorekA .html). The
Faculty at CTAHR provides an active and inter-
esting research environment housing number of ac-
tive groups of ecologists, geneticists, plant and en-
vironmental management biologists (see: http://-
www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/ctahr2001/ for an overview).
Starting date is ﬂexible, preferably in January 2007,
and the salary is for a 50% RA and includes a tuition
waiver and beneﬁts. Applicants should provide a full
CV, including details of laboratory experience, a list of
undergraduate courses and grades, a maximum 1-page
description of research interests, three letters of refer-
ence, and desired start date. There is no ﬁxed applica-
tion deadline, but position will be ﬁlled once a suitable
candidate is found. Potential applicants are encouraged
to submit their applications as soon as possible. Ap-
plications should be sent (preferably by e-mail) to Dr.

spread of cultural traits using epidemiological and phy-
logenetic approaches, with the goal to investigate thedistribution of cultural variants in non-human primates
and humans. Speciﬁc research aims will be decided
based on the interests of the student, and could include
any of the following: (1) developing an agent-based
model to investigate how diﬀerent social learning mech-
anisms impact the spread of cultural traits; (2) devel-
oping and testing statistical methods for diﬀerentiating
transmission mechanisms in human cultural practices;
(3) using phylogenetic comparative methods to exam-
ine the distribution of cultural traits in non-human pri-
mates and across human societies; and (4) developing
models to compare and contrast cultural transmission
in non-human primates, early humans and modern hu-
mans. The PhD project will include both theoretical
and empirical components and will address fundamen-
tal questions in human evolution. The student should
have some previous experience with modelling, com-
puter programming, and statistics, with an interest in
developing these skills further through a PhD program.

PhD student position in Evolutionary Developmental
Plant Biology, Athens, OH
A PhD student position is available at the Depart-
ment of Environmental and Plant Biology, Ohio Univer-
sity, to study the genetic control of early events in leaf
development in the basal eudicot plant Eschscholzia.
The typical bifacial architecture of angiosperm leaves
with their upper and lower surfaces is determined at
early stages of leaf development. Evidence from the
model plant Arabidopsis indicates that a network of
genetic regulatory elements is responsible for this mor-
phogenetic process. In other plants, some of these genes
are also involved in leaf dissection, a process by which
the leaf blade is subdivided into segments. To better
understand the evolution of development of bifaciality
and leaf dissection, this project addresses the role of
relevant genes in the basal eudicot Eschscholzia califor-
nica, a plant with bifacial and dissected leaves.
The project involves (i) cloning and characterization of
relevant candidate gene families, (ii) characterization
of early stages of leaf development and associated gene
expression patterns, and (iii) the study of phenotypic
eﬀects of modulated expression using a transgenic ap-
poach and virus-induced gene silencing. Candidates for
this position should have a strong interest in plant de-
velopment and evolution, and demonstrable experience
in some of the methods mentioned. The ability to work
independently and self-motivated is essential.
The student will join a new lab in a Department with
vibrant research in plant development, systematics, and
evolution.
Interested candidates should send a cover letter, a cur-
riculum vitae, a statement of research experience, and
the names and contact information of at least two sci-
entists available for reference. Please send your appli-
cation and informal inquiries to Dr. Stefan Gleissberg
(gleissbe@ohio.edu). Review of applications will start
July 15, 2006, and continue until the position is ﬁlled.

SouthernIllinoisU PineBeetle
Graduate position to study dispersal patterns of South-
ern Pine Beetles (Dendroctonus frontalis) using genetic
markers, modeling and GIS.
The population dynamics of most organisms are in-
ﬂuenced by landscape structure, including the size
and arrangement of habitat patches, distance between
patches, and the matrix (non-habitat areas) in which
the habitat patches are embedded. This has been rec-
ognized for SPB, where attempts have been made to
link risk of SPB infestation with features of the land-
scape, including the location of stands of suitable host
pines, their arrangement in space, and possible corri-
dors for dispersing beetles. As part of an ongoing re-
search project we have developed a suite of polymorphic
DNA microsatellite markers for the SPB and demon-
strated that they exhibit heterogeneous allele frequen-
cies across large geographic scales. This project extends
the use of these genetic markers to measure SPB move-
ment through fragmented habitat and on a hierarchy of
spatial scales. The emphasis of this project will be pop-
ulation genetics and modeling based on microsatellite
marker data as well as ﬁeld estimates of SPB dispersal.
Applications will be accepted at either a PhD level (for
which applicants should have a Masters of Science and
competitive GPA and GRE scores) or a Masters level.
For Ph D candidates, previous experience in relevant
lab work and GIS software would be a plus. The start
date will be August, 2006.

Background and project description
Imprinted genes are epigenetically modiﬁed in a par-
ent of origin-dependent manner. This usually results
in diﬀerential expression of maternally- and paternally-
derived alleles. Imprinted genes are few in number but
have important roles in growth, development and be-
haviour, and abnormal regulation of imprinted genes
has been implicated in several human disorders. There
are many unanswered questions regarding the biology
and evolution of imprinting, and extending the study
to novel mammalian orders should help to answer some
of these, as to date most studies have focused on im-
printing in mice and humans.
The dog (a member of the Carnivora) belongs to a dif-
ferent group of mammals than rodents and primates.
This, together with the recent publication of the canine
genome, means that the dog is an important animal for
comparative genome studies. In addition the dog is
fast becoming a valuable model of human disease. This
studentship will investigate the imprint status of the
canine IGF2 receptor.
The IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) is large multifunctionalJuly 1, 2006 EvolDir 15
protein that has an essential role in normal mammalian
development and also acts as tumour supresssor. Its
gene is imprinted in some mammals (including opos-
sum, mice, cattle) but not in others (egg-laying mam-
mals, tree shrews, lemurs, humans). In an eﬀort to
understand how the imprinted IGF2R evolved, we are
studying the regulation of this gene in novel animal
taxa and the investigation of the canine IGF2R repre-
sents an extension of this study. The student will be
based in UCD’s School of Biology and Environmental
Science (Nolan lab). Our collaborators in this research
include other research groups in Dublin and in Duke
University (North Carolina).
Applications for this position are invited. Candidates
should have an honours degree in a biological sub-
ject (minimum 2:1 grade; preferably with experience
in molecular biology). We are seeking highly motivated
individuals, with an interest in genomic imprinting and
epigenetics, an enthusiasm for research and a determi-
nation to succeed.

We are looking for a suitable student with an inter-
est in DNA bioinformatics to work on the phyloge-
nomics of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Lolium
is the most important forage grass species of Ireland and
most temperate regions of the world. We have fund-
ing to sequence its entire mitochondrial and chloroplast
genomes (outsourced to a private company) and investi-
gate them in a phylogenomic context. More speciﬁcally
we would like to investigate their sequence structure
and variation in comparison to other sequenced grasses,
compare them phylogenetically to other grasses, de-
velop molecular markers for both genomes applicable
in plant breeding, and to get ﬁrst insights into the hor-
izontal gene transfer between nuclear and organellar se-
quences of the species.
This project is a collaboration between molecular
laboratories at the Department of Botany, Trin-
ity College Dublin (TCD) and Teagasc and will be
jointly supervised by Dr Trevor Hodkinson (TCD;
www.tcd.ie/Botany/staﬀ/THodkinson ), Dr Susanne
Barth (Teagasc Oak Park; http://www.teagasc.ie/-

UDurham RoeDeer PopGenet
Fully Funded PhD Studentship on the Temporal and
Spatial Population Genetics of Roe Deer in the UK
The roe deer is one of only two deer species indige-
nous to the British Isles (the red deer is the other).
Known roe deer remains in Britain date back to the late
OIS 5 (about 100,000 years ago). They are numerous
in archaeological sites throughout Roman and Saxon
times, but suﬀered a steady decline during the medi-
aeval period. Protected by the Normans, they were
declared beasts of the warren (unworthy of noble hunt-
ing) in 1338. This led to extensive hunting, and by the
late 16th century they had become scarce throughout
England, and extinct in Wales, though populations sur-
vived in some areas of Scotland. The UK population
remained small (though how small is not known) until
a series of re-introductions into the Lake District, East
Anglia and southern England re-established the species
in England in the 19th century. The impact of rein-
troductions on native populations is poorly understood
in mammals, however this species provides an excellent
test case, given the long historical record and availabil-
ity of samples from all relevant time periods.
The project will involve the application of population
genetic analyses to modern and ancient roe deer sam-
ples to help address this question. The student shouldhave at least a 2.1 undergraduate degree result, and
preferably an MS degree in a related ﬁeld. The stipend
will be £12,000 per year, to cover tuition and living ex-
penses (note that this would be suﬃcient to cover all
expenses for UK and EU nationals, but not for overseas
students). Consumables costs are also fully funded.
Please send your c.v., a cover letter explaining why
you are well suited to this project, your undergraduate
and where relevant postgraduate course records, and ar-
range for three letters of reference to be sent to: Prof.
A. R. Hoelzel, School of Biological and Biomedical Sci-
ences, University of Durham, Durham, DH1 3LE,UK.
These materials should be preferably sent by email to
a.r.hoelzel@dur.ac.uk to arrive before the end of June
(for a preferred starting date of Oct 2006). Applicants
should also complete the application form for post-
graduate studies, which can be downloaded from the

Project summary: Colonisation is a crucial process,
shaping almost all biological systems. Understanding
the interaction of evolutionary forces during habitatJuly 1, 2006 EvolDir 17
colonisation is key for many areas in biology from the
applied - environmental research and management - to
fundamental ones - population structure, phylogeogra-
phy, biogeography, ecology and speciation. Despite its
importance, colonisation is not well understood from
an evolutionary point of view. Due to the ﬂeeting na-
ture of colonisation, evolutionary studies in the wild are
diﬃcult, labour intensive, and very rarely have colonis-
ing populations been followed from the initial stages.
Few studies have been able to test experimentally the
interaction of evolutionary forces in new populations,
mostly due to challenges involved in the choice of model
organism. Accelerated global climate change and other
anthropogenic impacts are changing colonisation rates,
increasingly aﬀecting native species distribution ranges
and facilitating biological invasions, making the under-
standing of colonization even more urgent. The PhD
student will be closely associated to an ongoing NERC
funded fellowship awarded to Africa G´ omez to inves-
tigate the interplay of inbreeding, migration and local
adaptation during colonisation in zooplankton popula-
tions. The PhD student, in a separate but comple-
mentary project, will investigate the interaction of evo-
lutionary forces in recently established populations by
using laboratory microcosms of the rotifer (Brachionus
plicatilis). The early stages of population establish-
ment will be examined experimentally to test for i) the
eﬀect of diﬀerent numbers of founding individuals, ii)
the dynamics of inbreeding, iii) the development of local
adaptation, iv) the build-up of neutral genetic diﬀeren-
tiation by using microsatellite loci and vi) the impact
of migration. Therefore the student will gain a broad
knowledge in ecology, genetics and evolution, as well
as transferable skills in experimental design, statistics,
molecular techniques and analysis.

Brief project description: The behaviour and genetics
of reproductive dominance
Much is known about the ultimate causes of social liv-
ing (e.g. kin selection, reciprocity) but little about
the genetic mechanisms underlying diﬀerences in social
phenotype. Advances in genetics and genomics mean
that such investigations are now possible. The com-
mon ant Leptothorax acervorum shows easily scoreable
variation in social phenotype as in multiple queen nests
either all queens reproduce equally (low skew) or only
one queen reproduces (high skew). These social pheno-
types are stable in the lab and are likely to have a ge-
netic basis. The aim of this studentship will be to inves-
tigate the behavioural mechanisms that maintain high
reproductive skew among queens in some colonies and
to uncover genes that are diﬀerentially expressed be-
tween reproductive queens in high and low skew nests.
The work will be highly diverse including ﬁeldwork, be-
havioural observations and experiments, molecular ge-
netic lab work and chemical ecology.

A Ph.D. position in molecular evolutionary biology is
available in the lab of Axel Meyer in the Department of
Biology at the University of Konstanz in Germany. The
evolutionary biology group is an international group of
students and postdocs that consists of about 20 people
from 10 diﬀerent countries. The language in the lab is
English.
We are looking for an energetic Ph.D. student who is
interested in speciation, molecular evolution, bioinfor-
matics/genomics, or evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy. The speciﬁc research projects we are recruiting for
involve (1) research on the patterns of relationships and
population genetics of cichlid ﬁshes (2) as well as the
discovery and functional characterization of (e.g. col-
oration) genes underlying the diversiﬁcation of cichlids
in Africa and in Nicaragua.
The great lakes in East Africa house some of the world’s
most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Lakes Victoria,
Malawi and Tanganyika are particularly well-known
for their adaptive radiations of hundreds of endemic
species of cichlid ﬁshes. We are interested in under-
standing speciation, phylogeography, molecular evolu-
tion and molecular phylogenetics of these cichlid ﬁsh
assemblages. Also, we wish to identify and charac-
terize the function of genes that are involved in the
phenotypic diversiﬁcation and presumably speciation
of cichlid ﬁshes. Several molecular biological, “devo-
evo” and genomic approaches, including candidate gene
approaches, DNA-chip technology, characterization of
ESTs, in situ hybridization in cichlids and transgenics
in zebraﬁsh are used to address these questions. We
are also interested in evolutionary genomic questions
and the evolution of novel gene functions after gene
and genome duplications.
Some recent publications of the lab include: Verheyen
et al. (2003). The origin of the superﬂock of cichlid
ﬁshes from Lake Victoria, East Africa. Science 300:
325-329. Salzburger et al. (2005). Out of Tanganyika:

metric evolution in two ﬁsh-speciﬁcally duplicated re-
ceptor tyrosine kinase paralogons involved in teleost
coloration. Molecular Biology and Evolution 23:1192-
1202.
Funding is available for at least 2 years. A Ph.D. thesis
in Germany is supposed to be ﬁnished within about 3
years. Ph.D. salaries (50% BATII/a government pay
scale) are approximately 20 to 25,000 Euros annually,
(depending on marital status, age, etc.) before deduc-
tions for taxes, health insurance and retirement contri-
butions.
The position is open immediately. The review and invi-
tation of applicants will begin at the end of June 2006
and will continue until the position is ﬁlled. To ap-
ply, please email a curriculum vitae, including a list
of publications, a statement of research interests, and

oﬀered within the competition for PhD fellowships at
University of Rennes 1,France.
!!! Deadline for inscription: 22 June 2006 !!!July 1, 2006 EvolDir 19
Obligatory dates for presentations of short-listed can-
didates: 10 / 11 July 2006.
SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND: Contemporary ecology
is implicitly based on the hypothesis that phenotypes
of species respond to changes of their environment.
These responses happen on the level of diﬀerentiation
of populations within species as well as on the level of
macroevolution of traits across species. Recent stud-
ies, however, indicate that this fundamental hypothesis
often lacks support. Species exposed to changing cli-
mates, for instance, usually redistribute in space, they
migrate with their climate (Ackerly 2003, Int. J. Plant
Scie.). Species that stay will often be displaced by
species that immigrate and are already well adapted to
the novel climate. Consequently, the climate niche of
species usually remains very rigid even across time peri-
ods of millions of years (for instance Prinzing et al. 2001
Proc. R. Soc. B). Adaptive responses of phenotypes are
thus replaced by migrations and invasions. Overall, it is
not obvious how phenotypes of species can respond to
new climates. Recently, several hypotheses have been
proposed to resolve this paradox. These hypotheses
propose that an adaptation or adaptive plasticity is
likely to occur in particular situations:(A) At the mar-
gin of climatic gradients. Two scenarios have been sug-
gested. First, phenotypic responses appear at the mar-
gin where living conditions of established species be-
come increasingly extreme, provided that species that
are already well adapted to these conditions cannot
immigrate from outside or where preadapted invasive
species are not available from the outside. Second, the
response appears at the margin where species face in-
creasingly favorable conditions and can thus expand
their range, leading to founder eﬀects and increased
phenotypic variability. (B) As a function of endemism.
Again, two scenarios have been suggested: First, en-
demics are more responsive as their genotypic adapta-
tions to local conditions are not diluted by genotypes
arriving from outside. Second, the endemics respond
less, as they do not proﬁt from an immigration of geno-
types from regions with a climate resembling the novel
conditions arising at the given locality. These hypothe-
ses will be studied for plant species, at the level of
intraspeciﬁc diﬀerentiation of populations, and at the
level of macroevolution of traits of traits across species.
For the ﬁrst level, we will use a system that is currently
going through major environmental changes, with a
well known history of colonization and a number of
endemic species: the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands.
In the ﬁeld, the student will characterize climate and
soil gradients, will sample diﬀerent species, and culture
plants for two generations in order to verify the heri-
tability of the phenotype. In the lab, the student willmeasure vegetative and reproductive structure, char-
acterize biochemical phenotypes and their response to
environmental conditions (metabolomics, polyamines,
growth regulators contributing to stress tolerance; e.g.;
Hennion et al. 2006; Heat Shock Proteins will be stud-
ied in collaboration).For the second, macroevolution-
ary, level we will proﬁt from the regional ﬂora that
is best known in terms of phylogenetic relationships,
life history traits, and distribution along environmen-
tal gradients; the ﬂora of central Europe. The student
will reconstruct characters of ancestors, i.e. their po-
sitions along environmental gradients and their degree
of endemism, within habitats and regions. The student
will identify macroevolutionary changes of life histories
and certain physiological traits. Finally (s)he will test
whether endemism of ancestors, or their position along
environmental gradients, inﬂuence the evolution of the
life history and ecophysiology of the descendants.
SALARY / ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND:
A PhD fellowship by the Ecole Doctorale Vie,
Agro, Sant´ e( http://www.vas.univ-rennes1.fr/ ) for

Adaptive radiation has long been a central theme in
evolutionary biology and this selection driven process
is thought to be a fundamental engine of biological
diversiﬁcation. Recent years have seen a tremendous
growth in empirical studies and synthetic reviews of
the subject. Our proposed work, however, addresses
an important shortcoming: there are almost no stud-
ies of how species interactions other than competition
promote or hinder adaptive radiation. In particular,
there is a dearth of studies examining how trophic in-
teractions among species spur or inhibit adaptive di-
versiﬁcation. Given that most species are embedded
in complex ecological networks encompassing multiple
trophic and/or symbiotic interactions, the shortage of
work in this area means we currently lack data of gen-
eral signiﬁcance, essential to ground-truth new theory
and predictions concerning the causes and processes of
adaptive radiation and biological diversiﬁcation.The focus of the proposed work is the pattern and pro-
cess of adaptive radiation in a multi-trophic commu-
nity context. Preliminary evidence suggests that the
gall midge Asteromyia carbonifera and its fungal as-
sociate (Botryosphaeria sp.) are undergoing an incipi-
ent, rapid radiation on their goldenrod (Solidago spp.)
hosts. Furthermore, the midges suﬀer extraordinarily
high rates of parasitism by hymenopteran parasitoids,
the distribution of which suggests that these enemies
may inﬂuence adaptive divergence of their midge hosts.
We will focus on understanding how adaptive radiation
in this system is inﬂuenced by geography, interactions
between mutualists, and interactions between trophic
levels. We propose to employ genetic analyses (e.g.,
DNA sequencing, AFLPs, microsatellites) and labora-
tory/ﬁeld studies to reconstruct the recent history and
ongoing population genetic and ecological processes in-
volved in radiation of the midge-fungus species com-
plexes. Cecidomyiid gall midges have long attracted at-
tention for their phenomenal taxonomic and ecological
diversity, and the proposed work will enable a detailed
dissection of the patterns and processes of gall midge
diversiﬁcation in its earliest stages. Most importantly,
the work will provide a tractable model for exploring
how adaptive divergence in complex ecological systems
is inﬂuenced by hosts, mutualists, natural enemies, and
their interactions.

Europe ArabidopsisGrowth
FieldResAssist
Field research assistants needed for Arabidopsis ecolog-
ical genetics project in Europe
We are looking for ﬁeld assistants to participate in a
large-scale investigation of the evolution of ﬂowering
time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our approach includes
analysis of ﬂowering time response to a wide range of
natural and manipulated environments at levels rang-
ing from DNA sequence variation to continental ecotype
distributions. This NSF-funded Frontiers in Biological
Research (FIBR) project – headed by Johanna Schmitt
at Brown University – is a collaborative eﬀort of four
labs in the US as well as Arabidopsis laboratories at
ﬁve research institutions in Europe. Part of this study
entails establishing a set of ﬁve common gardens in Eu-
rope in Valencia, Spain; Oulu, Finland; Norwich, UK;
Cologne, Germany; and Halle, Germany. At these sites
large numbers of European A. thaliana accessions will
be grown in multiple plantings synchronized with local
populations in order to assess geographic and seasonal
variation in selection on ﬂowering time and other life
history traits.
We are seeking research assistants who would be in-
terested in living at one of the ﬁve European ﬁeld
sites and assisting with plant care and measurement
. Applicants should have a bachelors degree in biol-
ogy or a related science. Prior independent research24 EvolDir July 1, 2006
experience (particularly with plants) is necessary, as
research assistants may be largely independent for pro-
longed periods of time. Although the primary duties
involve plant care and measurement, successful appli-
cants will have the opportunity to design and conduct
independent research projects with the host laborato-
ries based on the shared interests of the applicant and
the host lab. These research assistantships involve a
strong training component and were conceived as be-
ing analogous to Fulbright fellowships. Successful ap-
plicants will be awarded an NSF-fellow position. In ad-
dition to a fellowship stipend of $25,000/yr plus health
insurance, a portion of living expenses in Europe, ap-
proximately equal to monthly rent, would be provided
by a cost-of-living stipend.
At the moment our greatest need is for Septem-
ber 2006-2007 in Halle, Germany where we have
a collaboration with Matthias Hoﬀmann of the
Martin-Luther-Universit¨ at Halle-Wittenberg ( http:/-
/www2.biologie.uni-halle.de/bot/boga/hoﬀmann/-
hoﬀmann.html ). There will also be the opportunity
to visit the other European ﬁeld sites as part of the
research team. German language skills would be
helpful for this position.
Additional short-term and year long research assis-
tantships may be available at the other European sites
next summer. This is an excellent opportunity for grad-
uating seniors interested in a research career to obtain
further experience before applying to graduate school

PhD-POSITION IN POPULATION ECOLOGY
Dept. Conservation Biology, Institute of Zoology, Uni-
versity of Berne, Switzerland.
The position is funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation. The general aim of the study is to ad-
vance integrated population models in order to model
the dynamics of local populations. Integrated popula-
tion models are of growing interest as they make simul-
taneous use of diﬀerent kinds of data allowing the es-
timation of otherwise inaccessible demographic param-
eters. The population models shall be developed such
that they are suited to analyse population dynamics
of a typical short-lived passerine bird (pied ﬂycatcher
Ficedula hypoleuca) and of a long-lived species with de-
layed recruitment (white stork Ciconia ciconia). From
both species long time data series are available. The
ideal candidate is a very motivated graduate student
with strong skills in quantitative data analysis and a
deep understanding in mathematics. Ideally the candi-
date has knowledge in Bayesian statistics. The candi-
date does not need to have a biological education, ap-
plications of graduated mathematicians or statisticians
are welcome. The study does not contain ﬁeld work.
The successful candidates will join an active re-
search group consisting currently of 5 advanced
research staﬀ, 3 PhD-students and a varying
number of guest scientists and masters students
(www.conservation.unibe.ch ). Besides the Conserva-
tion Biology group, the ecologically oriented Zoologi-
cal Institute of the University of Bern consists of re-
search groups on Aquatic Ecology (Ole Seehausen),
Behavioural Ecology (Michael Taborski), Evolutionary
Ecology (Heinz Richner), Population Genetics (Lau-
rent Excoﬃer) and Synecology (Wolfgang Nentwig).
Salaries will follow the schemes of the Swiss National
Science Foundation.
Closing date: Open until ﬁlled, but all application ma-
terials, including a letter of motivation, CV and, pos-
sibly, list of publications should be received by July 1,
2006 to ensure full consideration. The positions will
start at the earliest possible date. Please send all ap-
plication material via postal or e-mail. For inquiries
please contact michael.schaub@nat.unibe.ch.

Positions in Ecology and Conservation Biology
The School of Biosciences on the University of Ex-
eter’s Cornwall Campus has now been established for
two years and currently consists of 13 academic staﬀ
(4 professors, 3 readers, 2 senior lecturers and 4 lec-
turers). This represents the end of the ﬁrst phase of
development, we are now seeking to recruit for the sec-
ond phase and are planning for the third phase which
will see the expansion of this group to approximately30 academic staﬀ. The staﬀ on the Cornwall Campus
all work within the Centre for Ecology and Conserva-
tion and future growth will be broadly within this area
of biology. We have buoyant undergraduate and post-
graduate degrees in ecology and conservation (currently
recruiting 50 at undergraduate and 30 at postgraduate
level). The group has a combined research income of
about £1.5M and a research postgraduate population
of 25.
Chair / Reader in Ecology and / or Conservation Biol-
ogy
Following the retirement of Professor Bryant, we are
seeking to recruit someone to provide leadership in ecol-
ogy and / or conservation biology and to inform the
development of the group as we move into future.
We would be interested in considering anyone whose re-
search programme fell within the general areas of ecol-
ogy or conservation biology. However, we would be par-
ticularly interested in recruiting someone with interests
and expertise in ﬁeld ecology. We would also bene-
ﬁt from recruiting someone whose work would utilise
molecular or conservation genetics. The successful ap-
plicant will have a track record of obtaining external
funding from a variety of sources, both governmental
and non-governmental as appropriate for their research
programme. He/she should have supervised research
postgraduate students. Importantly the successful ap-
plicant will have a series of publications in high proﬁle
journals suﬃcient to be considered an international ﬁg-
ure in the ﬁeld by his/her peers.

AFLP Software STRand
I am just getting started with developing AFLP mark-
ers from the forest fungi on which I work, and am hop-
ing to get some help in using the software that’s out
there. Looks like the ﬁle format for 3730 data is diﬀer-
ent that that used for the 3700 and others. I’m await-
ing a version of Genographer that has been modiﬁed
to work with 3730 data. I’ve also downloaded and in-
stalled STRand, but can’t make sense of it. Is there
anyone out there who can give me some step by step
guidance in the use of STRand for 3730 data? I con-
tacted their support but haven’t heard back. I’ve heard
good things about GeneMarker, but it’s pricey ($5K!).

CellLysing DNAextraction
Dear evoldir members,
I am setting up a new lab, including DNA extraction,
and need some advice. In the past I have use grind-
ing in liquid N to lyse cells in plant tissue before us-
ing Qiagen kits, but am not entirely satisﬁed with the
results or the process. I would like to move to some-
thing more mechanized and eﬃcient. I know some folks
use the Mixer Mill 300 (from Reusch or Qiagen), but
others use the Fast Prep Instrument (from qbiogene).
Does anyone have any ﬁrst hand knowledge – or even
hearsay – about which is better or more cost eﬀective?
If so, or you just would like to tell me about your own
experiences with either instrument, please email me at
deborah.overath@tamucc.edu.
I will post a summary of any replies in case others are
interested!

Climate rooms
Hi colleagues, our institute will move to another build-
ing in a few years. Since energy expenditure is high and
only expected to increase, we should take the opportu-
nity to reduce the ecological footprint of our institute.
My question: do you know examples of heat storage
systems, or other types of eﬃcient energetic design for
climate rooms? We could then ask engineers to apply
them in our new site.

Coleoptera nuclearmarkers
Hi,
we are busy with phyolgeographic studies of Scarabs
(Coleoptera) and are struggling to get enough good loci
in a microsatellite library (even using enrichment).
Does anyone have experience with microsatellites in
beetles and would be prepared to share this (especially
encountered problems or special tricks or idiosyncra-
cies)?
Is it possible that Coleoptera (just as Lepidoptera) do
not have that many microsatellite loci?
Could you recommend any other nuclear marker for
phylogeographic and conservation genetic studies inJuly 1, 2006 EvolDir 43

Many thanks in advance, and if need - I will summarize
the responses.

Diﬀ between means
“I have calcuted a large (88-specimen x 88-specimen)
matrix of distance coeﬃcients from comparisons of
RAPD (Random Ampliﬁed Polymorphic DNA) geno-
types (sets of DNA-fragment presences or absences).
From this matrix, I obtained a smaller (11-site x 11-
site) matrix of site-to-site distances by taking averages
of values in the specimen-to-specimen matrix. For ex-
ample, in comparing Site 1 to Site 2, I took the av-
erage of all Site-1-specimen to Site-2-specimen coeﬃ-
cients. Now, I wish to compare pairs of site-to-site dis-
tance coeﬃcients and make statements about whether
the diﬀerences between these values are signiﬁcant. Has
a method been developed for testing the signiﬁcance of
diﬀerences between means in this situation?”

FIS calculations
At the request of many Evoldir members, I will sum-
marize the responses to my original inquiry, which was:
>Does anyone know of a program that will give conﬁ-
dence intervals >from bootstrapping over loci for F-
IS, separately for every >population? > > I would
like to compare F-IS values among populations for
>microsatellite data. Most programs calculate only one
overall F-IS >value for the entire set of populations. >
>It would be tedious to create a set of single popu-
lation input >ﬁles, and then analyze them separately.
Although I have not >explored it thoroughly, I know
that even this option will not work >in some cases.
(Some programs will not calculate any F statistics >at
all for an input ﬁle that has only one population.)
I would add two additional notes: First, in case the
original posting was not clear, the speciﬁc goal is to
have conﬁdence intervals for F-IS for each individual
population. Without these, one cannot say with any
statistical certainty whether one population has more
or less inbreeding than another population.
Second, most software programs test the null hypothe-
sis of no population structure by permuting individuals,
genotypes or gene copies over populations. (Or some
similar “exact test”.) But 1) this method does not
provide conﬁdence intervals, and 2) strictly speaking,I believe that permutation approaches do not test the
same hypothesis as bootstrapping or jackkniﬁng over
loci (when mutiple loci are available). I will leave a
discussion of that distinction for someone to pick up in
another thread....
Please email the group if there are any major correc-
tions to the summary below.
Programs that will calculate population-speciﬁc CIs
for F-IS: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- GDA ( http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/-
plewis/software.php ) Will bootstrap over loci to gen-
erate conﬁdence intervals. To get population-speciﬁc
F-IS values in each population, exclude all but one pop-
ulation in the Misc menu. Very intuitive interface and
menu system.
GENETIX http://www.genetix.univ-montp2.fr/-
genetix/genetix.htm Will both bootstrap over loci and
perform permutation analyses for F-IS values in each
population. The software is in French, so get out your
dictionary if necessary. In the FSTATS menu, TEST
SUR FIS and choose the bootstrap or permutation
option. You can choose all populations as well as all
loci separately.
SPAGeDi http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ecoevol/-
spagedi.html I am told that this program will perform
the desired analyses, but I have not veriﬁed this. The
manual mentions one-delete jackknife procedures for
estimating conﬁdence intervals, but does not mention
bootstrapping,
Programs that will not calculate population-speciﬁc
CIs for F-IS: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - FSTAT
http://www2.unil.ch/popgen/softwares/fstat.htm TF-
PGA http://www.marksgeneticsoftware.net/tfpga.htm
These two programs will calculate signiﬁcance for over-
all F-statistics by bootstrapping over loci. However,
they will not calculate locus-speciﬁc F-IS conﬁdence in-
tervals. They will not perform these calculations on a
ﬁle with only one population.
GENEPOP ON THE WEB http://-
wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/genepop/ Calculates overall
and locus-speciﬁc F-IS values, but does not speciﬁcally
test the signiﬁcance of F-IS, or provide conﬁdence
intervals. (Options 1, 5, 6) Siginiﬁcance is assessed
with permutation tests.
ARLEQUIN 3 http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/-
arlequin3/ Runs permutation tests for an overall F-IS.
Does not calculate locus-speciﬁc F-IS values. Does
not bootstrap over loci. Laurent Excoﬃer has told me
that the next version (late June) will compute FIS for
each population, and test it by permutation, but no
bootstrap CI will be provided.July 1, 2006 EvolDir 45

FourLevel AMOVA
Dear EvolDir members,
I am working on a multi-species phylogeography and I
am looking for a way to perform a hierarchical AMOVA
with 4 levels : within population, among populations
within species, among species and among geographical
regions. Arlequin can handle three levels but not four.
Does anyone know a mean (and a sofware) to do this ?

Fst ConﬁdenceIntervlas answers
Thank you for all the answers. There is a listing of
all the answers I received. Unfortunately, it seems that
no software is able to compute automatically C.I. of
pairwise FST. I checked all the softwares that are men-
tioned in those answers and I can conﬁrm that no one
fulﬁlling my requirements. I decided to use the solution
(the hard and long one...) proposed in the ﬁrst answer
included in this message. With a good work technique
it takes me about 4 hours (instead of 1-2 day) to calcu-
lated CI for 277 pairwise comparisons. Good luck and
many thanks again!Philippe.
Original message:
Does somebody know a software allowing the estima-
tion of conﬁdence intervals for pair-wise Fst using boot-
straps over loci? It seems that both Arlequin 3.01 and
Fstat are only able to estimate conﬁdence intervals for
the overall Fst.
Thank you.
===I asked the same question about 8 months ago
and received a lot of software suggestions, including
GENEPOP, MSA, SPAGEDI, POPDIST, GENETIX
and the ones you’ve already mentioned. However,
browsing through the software I did not ﬁnd any of
them fulﬁlling my requirements (Newer versions might
include what you are looking for). After spending weeks
trying out and searching for appropriate software, I
found that creating FSTAT inputﬁles for each pair of
populations and obtaining 95% CI for the overall Fst
was the best (only?) solution. Know its a very tedious
way around the problem, but with <100 pairs, good
copy/paste skills and music on the ipod it should be
possible to do in a day or two...
===I encountered the same problem in a study of ours.
I decided to use “Resampling Stats” to calculate a boot-
strapped “average pairwise Fst) across all our AFLP-
loci. Maybe this is not the most elegant way how to do
it, but it is at least one way to do it!
===I’m not aware of any software that can perform
that task. I’ve recently had the same problem and
ended up analysing 66 datapools seperately (in FSTAT)
to get the C.I’s on pairwise Fst’s. Just a couple a weeks
ago there was quite a similar question here on Evoldir
concerning C.I.’s on Fis values on subpopulation-level.
It seems to me that there is a big need for a piece of
software to calculate C.I’s on all levels. RSTCALC will
calculate all the desired C.I’s and tests, but only on
Rst values. Guess that wasn’t much help, but if you
get some usefull replies, please post the answers.
===I believe TFPGA (free software) will accom-
plish what you’re looking for. Here is the URL:
http://www.marksgeneticsoftware.net/tfpga.htm TF-
PGA provides ”Theta-P“ values, but these are equiva-
lent to Fst.
===You can do this in GDA (Genetic Data Analysis
- Paul Lewis - free download from Paul’s Web site).
You’ll have to select on pair of populations at the time,
although (easily done within the program, ie you don’t
have to change the input ﬁle). Have you considered
using permutation to test for the signiﬁcance of your
pairwise Fst values? This can be easily done in Fstat46 EvolDir July 1, 2006
or Genetix.
===I have used GDA ( http://-
hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/plewis/-
software.php ) for some of these types of calculations.
In a single dataset with multiple populations, you can
’Exclude’ (using the ’Misc.’ menu) all populations
but two, then calculate an FST and bootstrap over
loci (options within the F-stats menu) to get a conﬁ-
dence interval. In order to change parameters of the
bootstrap, go to F-stats – >Options – >Options for
bootstrap. Unfortunately, you would have to do this
for each pair of populations, but it seems to work well.
Good luck!
===The program GDA (Genetic Data Analysis;
Lewis and Zaykin 1999) will bootstrap over loci to give
conﬁdence intervals for pairwise Fst (theta). You have
a be a little tricky to get the estimate though. Once
you input your data into GDA, it will give you the
option of excluding populations from each analysis.
You have to exclude all populations but the two that
for which you are interested in getting a pairwise
estimate, and then estimate Fst and bootstrap over
loci for the conﬁdence interval. It won’t give conﬁdence
intervals for the estimates in the pairwise theta matrix
it estimates. It takes a bit longer this way, but I
don’t know of other programs that will give conﬁdence
intervals for pairwise estimates. GDA can be found

Genemapper MicrosatellitesDear all,
I am trying to analyse 2 microsatellites with ﬂuorescent
primers, one labelled with 6-Fam and the other with
Ned. I can see strong, clear bands on agarosa gels from
PCR products at 53C and 56C respectively. However,
when I analyse my samples on Genemapper I do not
get any signal at all or, in a few cases, I see many peaks
on a wider range than what I read from the agarosa
gel. Other primers analysed on the same run with the
same label provide clear peaks, so I assume settings on
the machine are ok. Has any of you encountered similar
problems? Thank you very much,

Multivariate SSRsDear EvolDir members: I have genotypes data of >50
microsatellite loci for ~400 samples of three Helianthus
species, one is a homoploid hybrid species, and the
other two are parental. I want to plot the individuals
based on their genotypes, in order to test the relation-
ships between the species. I am not interested in the
phylogeny, just in the relative distances between indi-
viduals in multi-dimensional scale (k=no. of loci). The
goal is to examine the relative position (in k dimen-
sions) of the hybrid species relative to its parents. The
problem with microsatellite data is that it is di-allelic
data, i.e., for each character (=locus) I have two states
for each individual, which could be identical (homozy-
gote) or diﬀerent (heterozygote), and are not indepen-
dent. I assume (for now) that each locus is independent
of the other loci (non-realistic, but it is corrected in a
diﬀerent analysis). Does anyone aware of a method to -
and better: software - that does things like that? Free-
wares are favorable, of course. Thanks in advance for

PopExpansion examples
Hi,
I’m interested in doing a comparative analysis on rates
of evolution in populations which have undergone an
expansion and those that have remained stable. Ba-
sically, I’m looking for examples of populations which
had a small long-term eﬀective population size and then
expanded. For example, island species which colonized
the mainland. I also need sequence from a closely re-
lated species which has not expanded and an outgroup.

Publishing evolution48 EvolDir July 1, 2006
Dear Evolutionary Biologists
The Society for the Study of Evolution is reviewing the
mode of publication of its highly-regarded international
evolutionary biology journal EVOLUTION.
The Society has a commitment to intellectual and hu-
man diversity - one reﬂection of this is its oﬃce of non-
North American Vice President. In that role, I would
like to ask for your opinions on some issues regarding
publication of evolutionary biology.
Please take a minute to answer the following questions.
Please answer irrespective of your opinion - a random
sample of opinions would be the best. Answers will be
kept conﬁdential, unless you specify otherwise.
Q1. If you have to pay page charges to publish in a good
journal (typically in the order of USD60 per page), how
much of a disincentive relative to other factors is this
to submit to that journal?
Q2. Have you ever decided to not submit to a particular
journal on the basis that you would incur page charges,
and if so, how often (eg rarely, usually etc)?
Q3. Have you ever requested a waiver of page charges
from any journal? Was it granted?
Q4. Are you aware that the Society for the Study of
Evolution has low-cost membership fees, and that one
of the beneﬁts of membership is an allowance of 12 fee-
free pages per year if your work is published in EVO-
LUTION?
Q5. Are you a member of the Society for the Study of
Evolution, and if not, why not?
Q6. Have you published in EVOLUTION? How often?
Q7. What is the country/region from which your re-
search funding comes?
Q8. Do your national funding bodies mostly allow ap-
plication for publication charges?
Q9. Do you have any other comments on the subject
of publication of evolutionary biology?
thank you for your time.

ever, on-campus housing is now closed, and oﬀ-campus
housing for 2-4 nights is expensive and will probably
involve renting a car. I can do this, but I would prefer
to save my (nonproﬁt) company some money, and also
avoid commuting, by sharing some on-campus housing.
I would be happy to pay half of the room cost, bring a
sleeping bag and pad and camp out on the ﬂoor. I have
found housing with friends for the ﬁrst 2 nights (the
24th and 25th), but am still seeking it for the nights of
the 26th and/or 27th.
(I work for the non-proﬁt National Center for Science
Education, and we spent much of last year working on
the Kitzmiller v. Dover case where “intelligent design”
was ruled to be unconstitutional. There will be a day-
long session on this case on Monday, June 26, which is
why I was invited. So I might be a not-entirely boringJuly 1, 2006 EvolDir 49
guy to have hang around.)
Email me at matzkeATncseweb.org if you see a possi-
bility for some arrangement. Perhaps a grad student
out there wants to save a few bucks. Thanks!

SSR multivariate analysis answers
Thank you for all the people that responded to my in-
quiry. Down there are the answers. Of all the answers,
I choose GenAlEx6, (thanks to Peter Smouse) and al-
ready tried it. It is a module for Excel, ﬁt to both Mac
and PC, easy and intuitive to use. Based on my three-
days experience, I can recommend it for such analyses,
and perhaps for many more. Yuval
Here is the original question:
>Dear EvolDir members: >I have genotypes data of
>50 microsatellite loci for ~400 samples of three He-
lianthus species, one is a homoploid hybrid species, and
the other two are parental. I want to plot the indi-
viduals based on their genotypes, in order to test the
relationships between the species. I am not interested
in the phylogeny, just in the relative distances between
individuals in multi-dimensional scale (k=no. of loci).
The goal is to examine the relative position (in k dimen-
sions) of the hybrid species relative to its parents. The
problem with microsatellite data is that it is di-allelic
data, i.e., for each character (=locus) I have two states
for each individual, which could be identical (homozy-
gote) or diﬀerent (heterozygote), and are not indepen-
dent. I assume (for now) that each locus is independent
of the other loci (non-realistic, but it is corrected in a
diﬀerent analysis).>Does anyone aware of a method to - and better: soft-
ware - that does things like that? Freewares are favor-
able, of course. >ANSWERS: **************
Data modiﬁcations advices -
You could calculate a genetic distance called DPS,
the proportion of alleles shared between individuals.
This is an individual-based genetic distance suitable
for codominant markers. The computer program MSA
(Microsatellite Analyzer) by Dieringer & Schlotterer
can do this. The software was published in Molecu-
lar Ecology Notes. After you got the individual-based
distance matrix you could resolve this with one of many
multivariate techniques. E.g. you could use MSD (mul-
tidimensional scaling) or PCA (principial component
analysis). Both methods can be carried out with gen-
eral stats software packages, e.g. SPSS or JMP. ———-
(Rodney Dyer:)
I have software on my server (Multivariate Genotypes)

that takes diploid multilocus data and turns it into mul-
tivariatly normal data. You can look at the 2GenerV

overview of how this works, or I would be happy to
discuss it with you directly if you like. ———-

Seeds book
Hi everybody,
This one might be interesting for some of you. A
new popular scientiﬁc book has just been published onseeds. Being literally the only book of its kind on the
subject, the scholarly written but highly readable ac-
count (judged so in an independent review) is a great
educational tool and additional read for university stu-
dents and everybody interested in plant structure and
evolution.
Prepared by artist Rob Kesseler and Wolfgang Stuppy,
Kews seed morphologist, “Seeds - Time Capsules of
Life” is a book woven around the Millennium Seed
Bank Project. It presents a natural history of seeds
illustrated with some of the most spectacular examples
of seeds and fruits found in nature. The story begins
with the evolution of seeds and their structure and
discusses their dispersal through space and time, the
latter ﬁnally leading over to the Millennium Seed
Bank Project which is featured in a separate chapter.
Using seeds collected in the UK and many of the MSB
Partner Countries, the highlight of the book are images
taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) that
have subsequently been artistically enhanced by Rob
Kesseler. For the ﬁrst time ever, Seeds Time Capsules
of Life reveals the minute and breathtaking detail
of seeds to the public eye and presents their natural
history before a scientiﬁcally sound background. The
book has recently been reviewed in the June issue of
the BBC Wildlife Magazine and is now available from
the publisher’s website, ( www.papadakis.net ), amazon
(http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1901092666/-
026-9855724-4062031?v=glance&n&6239 ) and other
book dealers. An American edition will be published
by Fireﬂy in autumn.

Snail Recapture label
We are investigating freshwater snail movements in the
wetland in Northern Indiana (USA) and we want to
support our genetic data with a re-capture study. We
have used a water-proof paint “permapaque” (Opaque
pigment marker, manufactured by Sakura) to mark the
snails in the pond, however the paint goes oﬀ from the
snail shells after a couple of weeks. We are now think-
ing of using tags glued onto the snail shells however,
we have not found suitable one. We will be grateful ifJuly 1, 2006 EvolDir 51
anyone could advise us on any kind of labels (tags and
water-proof glue, paint, etc.) which would not be toxic,
will be water-proof, likely to last for at least several
months (ideally throughout the whole season of about
5 months) and possible to use for marking freshwater
snails of sizes around 5 to 10 mm.

Software IDC
IDC, a simple new Linux/UNIX and Windows/DOS
program for the calculation of independent contrasts,
is now available at:
http://iguana.wustl.edu/ ˜ liam/programs/idc/-
idcmanual.html IDC calculates independent contrasts
for a fully bifurcating phylogeny with branch lengths
and an arbitrary number of quantitative characters.
It outputs the contrasts and the correlation and VCV
matrices of the contrasts.
IDC can also simultaneously process an arbitrary num-
ber of trees and/or data sets which might be useful for
obtaining estimates of error due to phylogeny misesti-
mation and sampling error in the estimation of trait
means.
IDC is available with a detailed manual written in .html
and available from the link listed above and for down-
load.
Please report any bugs, however the source code for
this program is suﬃciently simple that users may also
be able to ﬁx bugs themselves.
Thanks for trying out this software. I hope that it is as
easy to use as is intended.

Structurama 1.0
We are pleased to announce Structurama 1.0, a pro-
gram for inferring population structure from allelic in-
formation sampled from some number of individuals.
The program implements two models for population
structure:
1. We consider the number of populations to be ﬁxed
to some number. This is the same model described by
Pritchard et al. (2000) and implemented in the pro-
gram structure.
2. We allow the number of populations to be a random
variable with a Dirichlet process prior (Pella and Ma-
suda, 2006). Here, the number of populations can be
inferred.
The assignment of individuals is inferred in a Bayesian
framework. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to ap-
proximate the posterior probability of assigning an in-
dividual to a population. The program summarizes
the results of the Bayesian MCMC analysis by using
the ’mean’ partition of individuals to populations. The
mean partition is the partition of individuals to popu-
lations that minimizes the squared distance to the par-
titions sampled by the MCMC algorithm. (We use a
distance on partitions ﬁrst described by Gusﬁeld.)
The program can be downloaded for free (free as in
“free beer”) from:

Subsampling question
Dear Colleagues,
A question:
I am comparing diversity between an adult population
(nR) and a population of oﬀspring made up of half-
sib arrays (n5 (25 arrays of ﬁve individuals each)). To
control for sample size eﬀects, I want to subsample 25
random adults and one random individual from each
of the 25 arrays. I want to perform 100 iterations and
compare the means. My markers are dominant.
Has anyone done something similar and do you know of
an eﬃcient way to perform the subsampling and anal-
ysis? I have been unable to ﬁnd an eﬃcient way to
take random subsamples from my dataset in any of the
common programs (e.g. Popgene).
(Note: I am not using rarefaction in this instance, since
it does not account for the relatedness of the half-sibs.)
Many thanks for any suggestions.

thor@rockisland.comText question
Quick question to the list here regarding an introduc-
tory text for non-bio majors that we are in the process
of adopting.
The text in question is published by McGraw Hill and
is entitled “Essential of Biology” by Sylvia S. Mader.
The text does not contain reference to the Miller/Urey
abiogenesis stuﬀ and has a reference to the Institute
for Creation Research (with such luminaries as Duane
Gish and Ken Cummings).
Is it odd for a Bio 101 text to have references, even
oblique ones, to an organization such as the ICR that
has the moto, “We believe God has raised up ICR to
spearhead Biblical Christianity’s defense against the
godless and compromising dogma of evolutionary hu-
manism. Only by showing the scientiﬁc bankruptcy
of evolution, while exalting Christ and the Bible,
will Christians be successful in ’the pulling down of
strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high
thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedi-
ence of Christ.’ˆ a?
Feel free to reply oﬀ list as this is a bit tangential to the
main focus of this mailing list. If others are interested
in the responses, let me know and I’ll post them on my

Unsuccessful Selection Expts
I am looking for references to artiﬁcial selection exper-
iments (in genetically variable populations) that failed,
i.e. there was no response to selection. I know of only
two: one that I published some years ago on selec-
tion for directional asymmetry in eye size, and May-
nard Smith and Sondhi’s paper on selection for direc-July 1, 2006 EvolDir 53
tion asymmetry in bristle number. If you know of any
others, please email me at j-coyne@uchicago.edu.
Thanks!

Unsuccessful Selection Expts 2
Thanks to all who sent me references to papers on fail-
ures of response to artiﬁcial selection. I’ve compiled a
list of these and will send it to anyone who is interested.
I would like to ask one more (but related) question:
besides the work of Ziljstra, Brakeﬁeld, and their col-
leagues on development time in butterﬂies, does anyone
know of experiments that selected for sexual dimor-
phism in a trait, that is for a trait whose expression
was selected to diﬀer in a consistent way between males
and females?
Please email me at j-coyne@uchicago.edu if you know of
any, or want a copy of the “failed selection experiment”
list.
Thanks, Jerry Coyne

WithinPop Duplications
I am writing to ask some advice about existing empiri-
cal data on within-population gene duplication events.
I am not talking about whole genome duplication. We
have been studying a number of genes in arbusular my-
corrhizal fungi. All the fungal isolates originate from
one population. Recently, we have found that for many
of the genes we looked at (18S, 5.8S, several ATPases,
a gene encoding a binding that has a heat shock func-
tion) there is considerable within-population variation
in copy number of these genes - we have shown this
with real-time PCR and, for some genes, with southern
hybridization.
Some people have commented to me that our ﬁndings
simply weren’t interesting because within-population
variation in gene copy number was already well known
in many other organisms, particularly in plants. How-
ever, in my literature searches I didn’t come up withmuch about within-population diﬀerences in gene copy
number except for some recent papers about among-
individual copy number in the human genome. In this
last case, it seems the publications discussed the ﬁnding
of among individual diﬀerences in gene copy number as
something interesting and relatively unexpected.
So my question is whether it’s true that this is already
well known and well documented in other organisms?
Secondly, it seems that the frequency and common-
ness of among- individual and within-population gene
duplication in organisms could be quite important. I
have read quite a few papers recently discussing among-
species diﬀerences in gene copy number for a wide va-
riety of diﬀerent taxa. It seems that the assumption in
the analysis is that the copy number is constant for a
given species. I wondered whether for those studies the
researchers know that there is little variation in copy
number in the species that they are talking about. If
the within-species variation in gene duplication would
be as large as the variation seen among species com-
pared then this could limit or alter the interpretation
of such studies.
We would be grateful for any comments about this.

First reply:
Dear Uri, 1) The diﬀerence between two databases is
because each group has its own assembly.
2) You may search in Gene database and see this gene’s
record.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=-
gene&cmd=Retrieve&doptfull report&list uids265 In
a Full report page you may chose “Gene Table” from
the “Display” option pull down menu to see the text.
3) Links in the right side of the full report will show
you where you may obtain more information about this
record.
Regards, Simin
Second reply:
My guess is that that sequence you are looking for
has derived from EST (Expressed Sequence Tags), and
translated to complementary DNA (cDNA). This is the
case with many genes in vast amount of species that re-
trieved from mRNA. The RNA has gone splicing before
the reverse-transcription, and only the coding regions
are in the gene-bank. , Yuval
Third reply:
Dear Uri!
Unfortunately I am not able to present the sequence to
you, but I am sure you can ﬁnd what you need. If you
blast your mRNA with the human EST-library and the
Human WGS-library and align the results, you should
be able to ﬁnd the sequence you need. I did that with
several genes in sticklebacks.
Cheers,
Sascha
Fourth reply (complete correspondence):
Hi Uri,I poked around the NCBI site some more, and I never
was able to really see a gene sequence annotated with
the exons. I can see a line drawing of the sequence, but
not the actual sequence. If I am missing something,
please let me know.
I was able to download the gene sequence, unannotated,
plus the sequences of the mRNAs (alternative splicing).
So I aligned them (see attached ﬁle).
You can view this with JalView, BioEdit or any other
multiple sequence alignment editor.
All of the introns begin with GT and end with AG,
which is the rule for most eukaryotic genes.

Hi,
Note that in both cases, the Ras oncogene is on the

the GenBank entry), And no genes are annotated on
either of these chromosome 11 sequences. I found Exon

Two years post-doc position oﬀered at INRA (Mediter-

opment of demo-genetic models for quantitative traits

conditions and detailed selection procedure are de-
scribed on this web site: submission deadline for

Candidates with strong experience in quantitative
genetics and population biology should ﬁrst contact
Fran&ccedil;ois Lefevre (lefevre@avignon.inra.fr),
sending full CV and references.
Objectives: Demo-genetic models, which integrate de-
mographic and genetic processes and their interactions,
are used for a simulation approach of the evolution of
forest tree populations in disequilibrium. Two comple-
mentary modelling platforms of this kind are currently
developed in France: for spatially explicit individual-
based models (CAPSIS, Dreyfus et al., 2005, http://-
coligny.free.fr/ ) and for metapopulation (METAPOP,
Le Corre & Kremer, 2003). These models have been
used to follow the trajectory of neutral genetic diver-
sity and start to be used to follow the evolution of
known QTLs under selection. However, for most adap-
tive traits, we expect that we will never have an ex-
haustive knowledge of all QTLs involved. In such a
situation, given some integrated information on the ge-
netic determinism of a trait of interest (e.g. genetic
variances, heritability, ...), a classical approach consists
in simulating an adequate distribution of QTLs and fol-
low these QTLs. However, this approach still relies on
strong asumptions that can aﬀect the predictions of the
demo-genetic models (Barton & Keightley, 2002; Porter
& Johnson, 2002; Naciri-Graven & Goudet, 2003). The
post-doc will investigate the impact of the modelling
strategy for quantitative traits on the simulations pro-
duced by the demo-genetic models. In particular, the
impact of a non-linear relationship between genotype
and phenotype will be investigated. In a ﬁrst phase
of the project, diﬀerent non-linear models will be com-
pared to simple additivity and compared among each
other for their predictions on the evolution of pheno-
typic diversity in various demograpic and genetic sce-narios. In a second phase of the project, modelling
tools for the relationship between genotype and pheno-
type will be implemented on the CAPSIS platform and
simulation studies will be conducted on demo-genetic
modules that relate to two experimental situations cur-
rently under study in our lab: the micro-evolution of
an exotic species (cedar) that was introduced 150 years
ago and naturalised in 3 generations, the dynamics of
recolonising tree species (beech and ﬁr) along an al-
titudinal cline. In both cases, selection processes will
be added to the other demo-genetic processes that are
already included in the models: dispersal, growth, com-
petition, mortality. Predictions in terms of spatial and
inter-generational patterns of adaptive diversity will be
compared to experimental data. Sensitivity analysis
will also be conducted. This research will contribute to
deﬁne criteria and indicators for monitoring the trajec-
tory of adaptive diversity.

cellence EVOLTREE ( www.evoltree.org ).

frog, Xenopus laevis and the ascidian, Ciona instesti-
nalis using a combination of bioinformatics approaches
including transcription factor binding site analysis. The
aim is to identify and dissect the conserved components
of the underlying GRNs and link the underlying net-
work architecture with network function (see Loose and
Patient 2004, Dev Biol 271:467-78 or Swiers et al, 2006
Dev Biol in press).
The project involves close collaboration with Dr Seb
Shimeld (University of Oxford), who will be carrying
out functional analysis of lens development in Ciona
intestinalis, and with Christine Slingsby (Birkbeck Col-
lege, London) and Nicolette Lubsen (Radboud Univer-
sity, Nijmegen). As a result of these collaborations, it
will be possible to test predictions made from the GRN
analysis in both Ciona and Xenopus.
Candidates must hold a PhD and ideally have an in-
terest in development and gene regulation. Experience
with relevant bioinformatics techniques such as tran-
scription factor binding site analysis and GRN tools
such as mFinder, NetBuilder and BioTapestry will be
useful. Basic HTML skills will be an advantage (al-
though training will be available).
Salary will be within the range £23,457 - £28,850
per annum, depending on qualiﬁcations and experience
(salary can progress to £33,445 per annum, subject to
performance). This post is available immediately and
will be oﬀered on a ﬁxed-term contract for a period
of up to three years, depending on qualiﬁcations and
experience.

ParisVI PopBiol
Postdoc in population biology in Paris, France
Postdoc grants will be delivered by Paris VI Jussieu
University to its laboratories, for foreign (not French)
phd being less than 35 years old. The grants will be
given for 1 year studies on topics selected by a scien-
tiﬁc commission of the University.
Our lab UMR Paris VI-CNRS-MNHN 5173, Conserva-
tion des esp` eces, Restauration et Suivi des populations,
Mus´ eum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France
(director : Denis COUVET) would like to present an
application to this grant. For that purpose, we need an
excellent candidate interested by our topic:
*Assessment of created populations of /Arenaria gran-
diﬂora /L./, /a species on the brink of extinction in the
Parisian region (**France**); *
The successful restoration of plants species in the
wild depends on the knowledge of their habitat re-
quirements and on the consideration of genetic, de-
mographic and ecological traits that increase vulner-
ability to stochastic extinction processes. The experi-
ment we performed on an endangered caryophyllaceae
in the Parisian region (/Arenaria grandiﬂora/ L.) is pre-
sented as an example of experimental restoration plan.
In a case where inbreeding depression was suspected
in the remnant populations, we created, in 1999, in
the Fontainebleau forest near Paris, six replicates of
a new population composed of plants from two diﬀer-
ent origins: Fontainebleau (the local population) and
Chinon (200 km apart). Since the transplantation in
the Fontainebleau forest, individuals have reproduced.
We follow annually the dynamics of the populations.
The aim of this postdoctoral study is (1) to analyse the
demographic data and (2) to use microsatellites to de-
termine the origin of the plantlets born in the created
populations (Fontainebleau, Chinon or both). In other
words, we would like to assess if the plants from both
origins have the same ﬁtness. On a fundamental plan,July 1, 2006 EvolDir 63
this study will give insights on local adaptation phe-
nomena. It will also highlight the possible advantage
to mix populations in the restoration plans.
We thus are looking for a Ph.D in population biol-
ogy. Preference will be given to candidates with a
background in population genetics and dynamics and
have experience in molecular biology (microsatellites).
Knowledge of the French language is not required.
We will select the best applicant among the candidates
that achieve to apply before June the 20 ^th. Please
supply by email (machon@mnhn.fr) (1) a statement of
interest, (2) a curriculum vitae, and (3) letters of rec-
ommendation.
If our ﬁle is selected by the University, the position will
start late 2006.

Postdoc:
Population genetic studies of the origin and early his-
tory of the dog
A 2-year Postdoc position is available in the re-
search group of “Evolutionary biology and forensics”
at the Department of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of
Technology, Stockholm, Sweden ( www.biotech.kth.se/-
genetech/info/savolainen.html ).
We are a small research group (Assistant professor
Peter Savolainen and two PhD-students) performing
world-leading research about the origin and early his-
tory of the domestic dog. We have in earlier studies of
mtDNA shown that the dog probably has a single ori-
gin from wolf somewhere in East Asia (Savolainen et al,
2002, Science: 298,1610-1613), and that the Australian
dingo originates from this population of East Asian do-
mestic dogs (Savolainen et al, 2004, Proc Natl Acad Sci
U S A: 101,12387-12390).
Our studies are based on a unique sample collection
from more than 2,000 dogs representing all major popu-
lations worldwide. This collection is, to our knowledge,
the most comprehensive for any domestic animal, most
other collections consisting mostly of European breeds.This puts us in a very good position for our further
studies.
The over all aim for our work is to describe in detail the
ﬁrst origin and early history of the domestic dog. First
we want to study in more detail the exact geographic
origin and time for the origin of dogs, the number of
founder animals (wolves), and the extent of subsequent
interbreeding between dog and wolf. In the next step
we will describe the spread around the world (routes
and time points) from East Asia to Europe, America,
Africa and Island Southeast Asia/Australia, and the
ﬁrst steps in the development of morphological varia-
tion leading to today’s types and breeds of dog. Thus,
the rather bold goal is to describe more or less every-
thing about the genetic origin and history of the dog,
leaving few fundamental questions unanswered.
Our earlier studies have been based on sequencing of
the mtDNA control region, but we are now analysing
also entire mtDNA genomes as well as Y-chromosome
sequence and microsatellites. Since we have very pow-
erful large-scale systems for DNA analysis, but have
been understaﬀed for the population genetic analyses,
we have at the moment a large amount of genetic data
just waiting to be analysed. This is therefore a good
chance for a Postdoc with a good knowledge in popu-
lation genetics to rapidly generate a number of papers.
We are looking for a Postdoc with a good knowl-
edge and experience in population genetics, phyloge-
netics and statistics, to help us analyse our large data
set. Some practical lab skills would be preferable, but
the important thing is a good knowledge in popula-
tion genetic and phylogenetic methods and ability in
manuscript writing. The applicant should, at the start
of appointment, have obtained a PhD-degree not more
than ﬁve years earlier.
The Postdoc would receive a stipend (tax free) of
17,000-19,000 Swedish crowns per month (exact sum
not ﬁxed at this point), equivalent to 1,800-2,000 euros
per month.
There is no exact deadline for applications, the position
is supposed to be started during the autumn 2006.
If interested in applying for this position, send an email
to Peter Savolainen (savo@biotech.kth.se), containing a
letter describing your previous research experience (in-
cluding a description of your skills in for example popu-
lation genetics, phylogenetics, statistics, computer pro-
gramming and molecular genetics lab work), a CV and
publication list.

UEdinburgh EvolGenomics
Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Genomics
An opportunity is available to work with Peter Keight-
ley (University of Edinburgh) and Adam Eyre-Walker
(University of Sussex) on the evolution of gene regula-
tory elements in mammals.
The great organismal complexity of mammals is be-
lieved to be determined to a large extent by the com-
plexity of gene regulation. The elements that control
the timing and speciﬁcity of gene expression are for the
most part located in noncoding DNA, and are typically
less well conserved than coding sequences. However,
the understanding of the nature of the sequences that
control gene expression is incomplete, and, in particu-
lar, the mode and strength of natural selection that op-
erates on sequence variation is largely unresolved. The
aim of this project is quantify the level of natural selec-
tion acting upon gene regulatory elements. To this end
we aim to (i) more accurately quantify the diﬀerences in68 EvolDir July 1, 2006
constraint in gene regulatory elements in hominids and
murids and (ii) collect polymorphism data from wild
mice with a view to using population genetic methods
to quantify the level of natural selection. The sequenc-
ing component of the project will be undertaken by a
research assistant, so the principle responsibility of the
post-doc will be the analysis of the polymorphism data
and the quantiﬁcation of constraint. The post will be
held at the University of Edinburgh. Applicant should
have a PhD, a record of published research in an area
relating to evolutionary genomics, and strong analytical
and computing skills.

UFlorida Polyploids
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN POLYPLOID RE-
SEARCH
We seek a highly motivated and enthusiastic individ-
ual to pursue studies on the evolutionary consequences
of polyploidy in Tragopogon. Tragopogon has been a
model system for multiple origins of polyploidy in mod-
ern times and is now being used as a model group in
which to study the earliest stages of genome evolution
in polyploids. Our lab has recently resynthesized F1 hy-
brids and polyploids between all three diploid species
that occur in the United States (T. dubius, T. praten-
sis, and T. porrifolius). The successful applicant will
be responsible for maintaining these lines in the green-
house, conducting molecular genetic work (PCR, RT-
PCR, Southerns, cloning, sequencing, etc.) in the lab-July 1, 2006 EvolDir 69

*Post-Doctoral positions in Evolutionary and Ecologi-
cal Genetics*
The University of Hawaii is recruiting two Post-
Doctoral positions in Evolutionary and Ecological Ge-
netics to begin immediately and conclude on May 14,
2009. One Post-Doc will be based at the Hilo cam-
pus (Island of Hawai‘i) and the other at the Manoa
campus (Island of O‘ahu) of the University of Hawai‘i.
The successful candidates will work as a team in the
Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics (EEG) focal area
within the University’s current EPSCoR grant “Collab-
orative Research for Ecology, Evolution and Cyberin-
frastructure”. The EEG focal area has two main re-
search objectives; 1) The study of biogeography and
phylogenetics of marine, aquatic, and terrestrial biota
to better understand the origin, dispersal, and diver-
siﬁcation of Hawaiian taxa, and 2) Evolutionary and
ecological functional genetics.
The islands of Hawai‘i serve as an optimal location to
study the processes of colonization and radiation. Un-
derstanding population structure, the genetics of adap-
tation and environmental eﬀects on gene expression
will be at the core of this research. The extreme cli-
matic diversity found across the islands and especially
the Island of Hawai‘i, where one can ﬁnd virtually ev-
ery climate type, provides ample opportunity to study
these important evolutionary processes. Examples of
the projects presently ongoing in this focal area include:
* Ecological genomics of the model tree species, /Met-
rosideros polymorpha/ * Adaptation of Hawaiian crick-
ets to lava ﬂow and cave habitats from a maritime
species. * Biodiversity assessment of marine, freshwa-ter and terrestrial macroalgae in the Hawaiian islands *
The eﬀects of behavior and extreme climatic diversity
on population structure, local adaptation, and specia-
tion in Hawaiian Picture-winged Drosophila. * Popu-
lation structure of amphidromous gobies in the context
of complex near and oﬀshore currents, and signiﬁcant
upslope weather events.
Creative people who think in terms of interdisciplinary
approaches to answering complex questions and who
have a track record of productive collaborations are en-
couraged to apply.
*Minimum qualiﬁcations*: Ph.D. from an accredited
university. Excellent communication skills. Research
experience using a variety of molecular techniques to
answer ecological and evolutionary questions.
*Desirable Qualiﬁcation*s: Previous experience in gene
expression studies, the use of Beckman CEQ 8000, mi-
croarray spotters and scanners, and real-time PCR. Ac-
tive interest in research questions relevant to the Paciﬁc
Islands especially Hawai‘i.

Two Postdoc positions in molecular evolutionary biol-
ogy are available in the lab of Axel Meyer in the De-
partment of Biology at the University of Konstanz, in
Germany. The evolutionary biology group is an inter-
national group of students and postdocs that consists
of about 20 people from 10 diﬀerent countries. The
language in the lab is English.
We are looking for energetic postdocs who are inter-70 EvolDir July 1, 2006
ested in speciation, molecular evolution, bioinformat-
ics/genomics and/or evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy. The speciﬁc research projects involve research on
the patterns of relationships and population genetics
of cichlid ﬁshes as well as the discovery and functional
characterization of genes underlying the diversiﬁcation
of cichlids in Africa and in Nicaragua.
The great lakes in East Africa house some of the worlds
most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Lakes Victoria,
Malawi and Tanganyika are particularly well-known
for their adaptive radiations of hundreds of endemic
species of cichlid ﬁshes. We are interested in under-
standing speciation, phylogeography, molecular evolu-
tion and molecular phylogenetics of these cichlid ﬁsh
assemblages. We also want to identify and charac-
terize the function of genes that are involved in the
phenotypic diversiﬁcation and presumably speciation
of cichlid ﬁshes. Several molecular biological, “devo-
evo” and genomic approaches, including candidate gene
approaches, DNA-chip technology, characterization of
ESTs, in situ hybridization in cichlids and transgenics
in zebraﬁsh are used to address these questions. We
are also interested in evolutionary genomic questions
and the evolution of novel gene functions after gene
and genome duplications.
Some recent publications of the lab include: Verheyen
et al. (2003). The origin of the superﬂock of cichlid
ﬁshes from Lake Victoria, East Africa. Science 300:

Funding is available for at least 2 years. Postdoc
salaries (BATII/a pay scale) are approximately 45 to
50,000 Euros annually, (depending on marital status,
age, etc.) before deductions for taxes, health insurance
and retirement contributions.
The positions are open immediately. The review and

UParis11 MolEvolGenet
Position Title: Postdoc, Molecular Evolutionary Ge-
netics
Position Location: U Paris 11 (Orsay) France
Position Description: A post doc position is available in
the lab Ecologie, Systematique et Evolution in the Uni-
versity of Paris 11 (Orsay). The targeted starting date
is September 1, 2006, but is ﬂexible. Our lab works on
a broad range of projects in evolutionary biology, e.g.
host-parasite co-evolution, biological invasions, repro-
ductive systems, genome evolution, using experiments
as well as mathematical modelling.
The project aims at detecting and studying the evo-
lution of genes involved in the specialization and the
speciation of a model parasite, Microbotryum vio-
laceum. Microbotryum violaceum is a sexually trans-
mitted disease. This fungus constitutes a complex of
sibling species, specialized on diﬀerent Cayophyllaceae.
This project aims at detecting genes that have rapidly
evolved, and diﬀerently between close species, assuming
that these genes will have important functions in spe-
ciation, specialisation, host-parasite co-evolution. EST
libraries are under construction for 5 sibling species ofMicrobotryum. Signatures of positive or diversifying
selection will be investigated by comparing orthologs
among these genomes, e.g. using the ratio of synony-
mous vs non synonymous mutations. These genes will
then systematically be sequenced in the whole species
complex, and their genealogies will be compared to
those of conserved genes. The variability of these genes
will also be analysed within populations and compared
to neutral markers (microsatellites, SNP, ..).
For this position, a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology,
molecular ecology, or related ﬁeld is required. Pref-
erence will be given to candidates with a background
in population genetic theory, statistical genetics, evolu-
tionary bioinformatics, and have experience in molecu-
lar biology, including standard DNA techniques (PCR
and sequencing). Ideally, the candidate will be involved
in various on-going projects in the lab, but also, he or
she would be encouraged to design and be responsi-
ble for independent research that involves the collec-
tion, analysis and publishing of data. Knowledge of
the French language is not required.

A post-doctoral position to work in protist diversity,

under the supervision of Puriﬁcaci´ on L´ opez-Garc´ ıa and
David Moreira.July 1, 2006 EvolDir 73
PROJECT
The diversity of microbial eukaryotes inhabiting the
deep ocean is still poorly known. Recent SSU rDNA
molecular surveys have revealed the occurrence of di-
vergent protist lineages in deep-sea plankton and, par-
ticularly, deep-sea hydrothermal sediments. However,
these studies remain very fragmentary. We propose in
this project the molecular characterisation of protist
diversity in various deep-sea oceanic samples, includ-
ing plankton and sediments. SSU rDNA will be used
as a reference phylogenetic marker, but additional con-
served genes will be considered. Comparative analyses
will be done to correlate protist diversity with envi-
ronmental features and with geographic data. In addi-
tion, the detection of divergent eukaryotic lineages will
be applied, if possible, to resolve problematic regions
of the global eukaryotic phylogeny. The latter is still
not well established and the incorporation of environ-
mental sequences may have a positive impact in tree
reconstruction by increasing the taxonomic sampling.

Vienna MHC Evol
Title: MHC genetics - Vienna One Postdoc position in
MHC genetics is available in the genetics lab of Franz
Suchentrunk at the Research Institute of Wildlife Ecol-
ogy, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria,
in co-operation with Helmut Schaschl (Konrad Lorenz
Inst. for Ethology, Vienna).
The position is connected to a project on MHC genes
and endoparasites in brown hares, Lepus europaeus, to
understand the meaning and consequences of immuno-
genetic diversity for individual ﬁtness in wild living
mammals. In this project we use brown hares (Le-
pus europaeus) as a mammalian model to assess and
analyse the consequences of sequence variation of two
MHC class II genes (DRB, DQB) on parasite burden
and other ﬁtness parameters in natural populations.
To understand the meaning of allelic MHC variabil-
ity we investigate relationships between sequence vari-
ation at the studied loci and individual endoparasite
load, various ﬁtness parameters such as body condi-
tion and female reproductive success, as well as CD4+
T-cell counts. To account for possible environmental
(e.g., population-speciﬁc parasite communities) or pop-
ulation genetic and phylogeographic inﬂuences on such
relationships, we study populations in Austria and Bel-
gium.
The successful applicant will be responsible for estab-
lishing and characterizing MHC genes in brown hares,
as well as for supervising a lab technician in the rou-
tine lab work. Furthermore, she/he will be responsible
for analysing the data (population genetic, evolutionary
and phylogenetic analyses) and writing manuscripts.
In this context practical experients in genetics are es-
sential (PCR, cloning, sequencing, microsatellite anal-
ysis, SSCP, basic bioinformatic tools, desirable skills:
real-time PCR, TGGE). Most desirably, the candidate
should have a strong immunogenetic and/or population74 EvolDir July 1, 2006
genetic background. Project language will be English.
Funding is available for 3 years. Postdoc salaries (FWF-
Austrian Science Funds- pay scale) are before tax and
NI are 2.878,60 Euro, 14 times per year. Depending on
marital status and chlildren this salary translates into
a net monthly salary of ca. 1750 Euro (14 x per year,
with reduced tax rate for the 13th and 14th salary).

edition of PGBIOINF, the FCUL post-graduate Pro-
gramme in Bioinformatics (2006-2007) and the FCUL
Master course in Bioinformatics according to the new
European rules.
The courses consists of 30 weeks of intensive courses,
steered under the responsibility of the FCUL and with
the participation of the researchers of the Instituto Gul-
benkian de Ciˆ encia (IGC), a service of the Funda˜ ao
Calouste Gulbenkian where some of the courses will
take place. It will train up to 20 specialists in Bioin-
formatics. By complementing PGBIOINF with a dis-
sertation work, students can obtain a MSc or a PhD
in Bioinformatics at FCUL. Students of Biological or
Informatics proﬁle can both apply. All courses are in
English.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
