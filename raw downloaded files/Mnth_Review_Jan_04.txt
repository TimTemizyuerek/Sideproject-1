bsu.cam.ac.uk)
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running se ries of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression mi-
croarrays. These immense data resources, and the un-
derlying complexities of molecular and cell biology, pro-
vide exciting research opportunitities for numerate sci-
entists.
With typically around 60-80 participants from math-
ematics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics,
biology and related ﬁelds, the MASAMB meetings
provide an intimate setting for exchange of ideas in
methodological and applied research. Research stu-
dents and scientists newly entering the ﬁeld of genomic
research are particularly welcome.
The meeting will contain approximately 12 half-hour
talks selected from participants’ submissions, plus a
poster session.
The cost of attendance at the meeting, including dinner
on the Monday evening, will be:
£120 (full residential) or £90 (without accommoda-
tion),
or for full-time students:
£90 (full residential) or £60 (without accommodation).4 EvolDir January 1, 2004

BayreuthU LifeHistoryEvol
Arthropod egg size is a particularly important trait inlife-history evolution because it is positively related to
ﬁtness, but at the same time constrains fecundity. Al-
though egg size has been found to vary among and
within populations, only few empirical studies have pro-
gressed much beyond documenting patterns of varia-
tion. This PhD project aims at disentangling the phys-
iological processes and genetic architecture of the hor-
monal control of egg size, focusing on juvenile hormone.
As hormone systems are primary coordinators for the
organism, their study can be expected to yield evolu-
tionarily relevant patterns of pleiotropy and the archi-
tecture of life history traits in general. This project is
part of a bigger project at Bayreuth University, aiming
at developing a more complete and integrated under-
standing of the evolution of egg size. Successful ap-
plicants are expected to have a keen interest in evolu-
tionary biology and the mechanisms involved in life-
history evolution. Experience with lab-based exper-
iments, analytical (LC/MS) or molecular techniques
would be an advantage. Applications (preferably by
email) should include a CV and a short statement
of research interests and skills. For further informa-

close to Freising (about 40 kilometers north of Munich).
Payment is at the level of BAT IIa / 2.
The DFG-funded (German NSF) project will investi-
gate the genetic basis of lipid metabolism in pigs. It
is based on the analysis of F2 and F3 animals result-
ing from crossing of a lean swine breed (Pi´ etrain) with
a breed having a very high lipid deposition capacity
(Mangalitza). The breeds diﬀer also in their circadian
food intake behaviour. The goal is to identify and anal-
yse genes that play a key role in lipid metabolism and
feeding behaviour using genetic mapping, bioinformatic
data mining and gene expression studies. Such genes
are candidates for human obesity and diabetes type II
and will be analysed further in the context of the human
diseases in the laboratory of Prof. Hebebrand (Clini-
cal Research Group, Clinic for Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry, University of Marburg).

Helsinki EvolImmunocompetence
Position for a Ph.D. student at the University of
Helsinki/ 20042006
Description: The project ’Evolutionary and functional
ecology of immunocompetence’ studies the ecological
consequences of allocation into immunocompetence for
developing organisms. The project deals with avian
model systems, where T-cell-mediated immunocompe-
tence in nestling birds is experimentally manipulated.
Functional ecological consequences include the trade-
oﬀ between nestling growth and immunocompetence.
Evolutionary ecological consequences focus on under-
standing the putative long-term eﬀects of immunocom-
petence for an individuals survival and for sexual or-
namentation. See also Brommer, JE (2003) Immuno-
competence and its costs during development: An ex-
perimental study in blue tit nestlings. Biology Letters(DOI: 10.1098/rsbl.2003.0103). This project is funded
for the period 1.1.2004 31.12.2006. Salary class A18
(c. 1610 euro/month).
Candidate: Applicants are required to have a M.Sc.
/equivalent grade or to be able to obtain such a grade
within four months of the start of the project. Experi-
ence in working with birds, experience with physiologi-
cal techniques (especially for quantifying immunocom-
petence), experience with molecular techniques, and ex-
perience of ﬁeld work are factors that contribute to the
ranking of candidates, but are in themselves not con-
sidered essential.
Responsibilities: The student is responsible for semi-
independently collecting the data from the ﬁeld (c. two
months annually), including carrying out a large part
of the planned experiments and measurements on the
birds. The student will be responsible for the analy-
sis of the physiological and other material collected in
the ﬁeld. Parts of these analyses include DNA work.
Data analysis and writing of articles (a Finnish thesis
consists of at least four articles) is done in cooperation
with J.E.B. and cooperation partners.

Helsinki GMOs
Ph.D. position for 20042007 at the Department of
Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of
Helsinki, Finland10 EvolDir January 1, 2004
ECOLOGICAL RISKS OF GENE MANIPULATED
ORGANISMS
The introduction of gene manipulated organisms
(GMO’s) to agricultural, ﬁsheries and forestry prac-
tices involves risks, such as competitive replacement of
natural species, hybridization between GMO and wild
populations, and cascade of changes in the community
composition through food chains. Despite the great
economic and public interest involved, littl e ecologi-
cal work has been conducted so far to directly address
these questions.
The aim of the present Ph.D. project is to increase un-
derstanding of the beneﬁts and costs of genetic manipu-
lation on individual ﬁtness, which is expected to depend
on the characteristics of the manipulated trait and the
density and frequency of GMO’s and natural popula-
tions. The project will develop life-history theory to
predict GMO introductions’ eﬀects on population dy-
namics, species persistence, and community composi-
tion. The project will also develop new methods for
ecological risk analysis.
We are looking for an individual with the following
qualiﬁcations: - M.Sc. degree (or equivalent) in ecology
or other relevant discipline - broad interest in diﬀer-
ent ecological questions - knowledge of (or motivation
to learn) ecological theory and population modelling -
motivation to obtain a Ph.D. degree in four years
The work is to be carried out at the Department of
Biological and Environmental Science, University of
Helsinki. The work will be supervised by prof. Veijo
Kaitala and Dr. Sami Aikio. Other members of the
team are: prof. Esa Ranta (Univ. Helsinki), prof.
Per Lundberg (Univ. Lund, Sweden), prof. William
Sutherland (Univ. East Anglia, UK) and Dr. Jo-
hanna Mappes (Univ. Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Finland). Our
group is part of the ESGEMO-research programme
(http://www.honeybee.helsinki.ﬁ/esgemo/ ) funded by
the Academy o f Finland.
The salary is approx. 1724 EUR/month (salary bracket
A19).
Send your application (in Finnish or in English), includ-
ing a curriculum vitae, a summary of research interests
and motivation for the project, and letters of recom-
mendation, by January 23, 2004 to:

The Illinois Natural History Survey invites applications
for a two-year Graduate Research Assistant position
with 50% RA ($1682/month plus tuition) to partici-
pate in an NSF-supported project on the behavior, sys-
tematics, and evolution of leafhoppers as outlined be-
low. The student is expected to work toward his or her
M.S. degree at the Department of Entomology ( http:/-
/www.life.uiuc.edu/entomology/home.html ) or in the
Program in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ( http://-
www.life.uiuc.edu/programs/PEEB/ ) of the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The position is avail-
able starting in the Spring of 2004. The requirements
are the B.S. degree in biology and strong interest in
insect biology and systematics or/and evolutionary bi-
ology and behavior.
HOMOPLASTIC EVOLUTION OF A STEREO-
TYPED BEHAVIOR AND ASSOCIATED STRUC-
TURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS IN THE
LEAFHOPPER GENUS CUERNA (INSECTA:
HEMIPTERA, CICADELLIDAE).Some New World
leafhoppers display a unique and little-understood
maternal behavior, egg-powdering: females coat their
eggs with brochosomes, specialized secretory products
of the Malpighian tubules. They also display corre-
sponding structural and physiological modiﬁcations.
Our data indicate that this behavior has been secon-
darily lost or lost-and-restored in particular lineages
multiple times. Among ca. 30 species of the North
American genus Cuerna, some are “powdering” and
some “non-powdering”. The idea of this three-year
project is to reconstruct the evolution of egg-powdering
in Cuerna as a model of decay and loss of a complex
biological function at the species level. The study
will include the following components: -Collecting
Cuerna in multiple trips within the U.S. and to Mexico
and Canada. -Comparative ﬁeld and laboratory
observations of oviposition behaviors. -Comparative
microanatomical study of the Malpighian tubules.
-Morphometrical study of the sexual dimorphism in
the leg chaetotaxy. -DNA sequencing and phylogenetic
analyses. -Comparative morphological study and a
taxonomic revision of Cuerna.January 1, 2004 EvolDir 11

work and in two other components of the study, ac-
cording to his or her interests. Interested persons

PhD vacancy
Eﬀects of environmental stress on the genetic structure
of natural populations of intertidal invertebrates
Function Starting from the ﬁrst of January 2004, a re-
searcher will be recruited for a period of four years on
a BOF-NOI project. The successful candidate will in-
vestigate the population genetic structure of intertidal
organisms in relation to the dynamic environment in
which they live. More speciﬁc the project aims to as-
sess following objectives:
(1) Do anthropogenic and/or natural stressors aﬀect the
genetic structure of natural populations and do they re-
sult in a genetic variability decrease?
(2) Which mechanism(s) are responsible for the ob-
served molecular patterning?
(3) Are these mechanisms initiated through adverse
mutational, physiological or ecological eﬀects and can
they be quantiﬁed?
This research will be performed on intertidal mollusc
species and will mainly be conducted along the Scheldt
estuary (The Netherlands). The genetic structure will
be determined through the use of diﬀerent DNA tech-
niques, while the degree in which adverse mutational,
physiological or ecological eﬀects, aﬀect the molecular
patterning will be assessed in a time-to-event labora-
tory experiment.
Proﬁle
We are looking for a highly motivated MSc in Bi-
ology, Biochemistry, Biomedical Sciences or an Ir in
Biological Sciences, experienced in molecular tech-
niques (PCR, SSCP, Microsatelites, Cloning, Sequenc-
ing) and/or DNA damage assays.
Interested?

Capture recapture data answers
I recently posted an inquiry re ﬁsh tagging and move-
ment on evol dir. Sincere thanks to all respondents.
Several people have also asked for the responses to be
posted back on evol dir. They follow my initial posting.Kind Regards, Leon Meggs
I am working on population genetics of Pagrus aura-
tus (Sparidae) in southeastern Australia. Current stock
recognition is mainly based on capture/recapture data
but I question whether the tagging of ﬁsh has a direct
inﬂuence upon spatial movement. There seems to be
very little literature available that critically addresses
this issue. If anybody knows of any such papers I would
be most grateful to be informed of such.
I do not know. I can only tell that it is very rarely docu-
mented in birds also. Capture inﬂuences movements of
geese (Pradel et al. 1995 Journal of Applied Statistics),
but not of Little Egrets Egretta garzetta (Henry et al.
submitted). I am sure you thought about it, but in case
you did not, my suggestions to look for information are:
- litterature about salmons, an organism on which sev-
eral marking technics have been used for decades (and
comparison of genetic and CMR data may be available
or published, i.e. maybe the best way to detect the in-
ﬂuence of tagging) - I have a colleague who did his PhD
on CMR and genetics of a river ﬁsh. You may locate his
current address via google: Laurent Crespin (he is cur-
rently in Chile) - I also have a friend who worked during
his post-doc on CMR of Bogus (?), I have forgotten the
name of this very common northern Atlantic ﬁsh... Ro-
main Julliard julliard@mnhn.fr I hope this is of some
help for you. Pierre-Yves I do not remind exactly who
were the persons I referred to, but yes you can forward
my reply. Please, add to the e-mail address of Laurent
Crespin (lcre@ceh.ac.uk, laurent.crespin@uio.bio.no; I
do not known what is his current address) the one of
Patrick Berrebi (berrebi@hyd.univ-montp2.fr; he was
his PhD supervisor, and I bet that he would appreci-
ate to be associated in the discussion). Kind regards,

I enclose reference to a review we wrote some time ago
that critically assesses issues on biological conservation
and stress and involves sections on the eﬀects of han-
dling. There may be some references in there that may
be useful to you. Hofer H, East ML 1998 Biological
conservation and stress. Advances in the Study of Be-
havior 27: 405-525. Let me know if you ﬁnd anything
else. Best wishes Heribert
Margaret Patcek asked me to reply to you re: your
tagging question. Most population estimates are based
on the assumption that marking does not eﬀect behav-
ior. This is marginally true, but depends on the mark.
With anadrimous ﬁsh, tagging may result in “fall back”
, or the temporary abandonment of migration. This
generally lasts about two weeks, but may result in the
total abandonment of a run by up to 40% of individ-
uals. With other species, even with invasive taggingJanuary 1, 2004 EvolDir 31
procedures like surgical implantation of transmitters,
the rule of thumb is behavior is normal after about two
weeks. We have conducted extensive studies on striped
bass and other land-locked species and ﬁnd this to be
true. Transmittered ﬁsh are found in schools with non-
transmittered ﬁsh and are caught on hook and line very
soon after implantation. With less invasive techniques,
like Floy or Hallprint T-bar tags, recovery is almost
immediate. We have tagged over 25,000 ﬁsh with Floy
t-bars, 25,000 with NMT VIalpha, 10,000 with NMT
VI elastomer, and 300,000 with NMT coded wire and
have found no diﬀerence in mortality, feeding, habitat
selection, or movement when compared to controls in
the lab or anecdotally in the ﬁeld. Bottom line: tagging
should have little eﬀect on movement related to stock
delineation. If anything, tagged ﬁsh may move more
than untagged ﬁsh, resulting in conservative estimates
of stock boundaries. However, assumptions are based
on either random marks, or random recaptures. If you
are using ﬁshery-dependant data, recaptures are prob-
ably not random, because eﬀort is density dependent.
Fisherman ﬁsh where they know they will catch ﬁsh
at a high rate. Areas between stocks, or in marginal
habitat may not be ﬁshed at all, resulting in a lower
(biased) probability of recapture. This could bias stock
boundaries, but should have little eﬀect on stock def-
inition. Hope that helps. My contact information is
below. I’d be happy to discuss this further with you if
you like. Regards, Jeﬀ Isely

Gel imaging answers
Dear Evoldir members,
Earlier I sent out a request for help with gel documen-
tation systems. Here is my original message followed
by the responses. Thanks to all for their help.
Evan
We are searching for a cheap agarose gel documenta-
tion system using just a digital camera. Has anyone
ever tried this? Is there some simple way to do this
without buying one of the expensive systems?
Thanks in advance, Evan
W. Evan Braswell Laboratory of Ecological and Evo-
lutionary Genetics New Mexico State University Las
Cruces, NM 88003
Be very carefull especially about the camera. I’ve just
bought a system from Biorad. It has rather expensive
digital camera - Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC40 - that is
totally inappropriate for that kind of photography. You
need to try if the autofocus works in this special condi-
tions. In Lumix it doesn’t. I have also tried Casio QV-
R40 (twice cheaper) with the hood supplied by Biorad.
Autofocus works much better, besides it has manual
focus (very useful in case of weak banding). However
the quality of pictures is quite weak. My advice is: 1.
Check autofocus on dark surfaces with weak pattern
(e.g. grey paper with only a few thin lines drawn on
it). 2. Check the picture quality. 3. Buy camera with
manual focus - just in case. 4. Maximum sensitivity
should be about 300-400 ISO. 5. Minimal optical pa-
rameters are: aperture - 2,8; shutter - 1/4 s. The longer
the time can be the better. Usual conditions for EtBr
stained gel are 400ISO, shutter=4 sec, aperture=5,6. It
is better because of bigger focal depth than with shorter
times. 6. The optical resolution should be at least 4January 1, 2004 EvolDir 33
Mln px. 7. You should have choice of level of compres-
sion - cameras with TIFF format are best however good
quality JPEG are also suﬃcient. Look carefully at the
pictures before you buy any camera :)
When I was in lab tech school, we used a UV transillu-
minator deck with a black cone-type thing with a hole
in the top that you would set over the gel and put the
digital camera up to. It seems that’s about the cheapest
one could set it up.
we are using a system you may be interested in. It
consists of Canon PowerShotG1 digital camera, hood
and two Kodak ﬁlters (as we’re using EtBr and SYBR
Green staining). In fact we purchased this system
from Elchrom Scientiﬁc ( www.elchrom.com ) and it was
about 5,000-5,500 EURO. However, I think that it was
due to a gel analysis software included (TotalLab).
We’re using this system over 2 years and haven’t had
any problems with it yet, quality of pictures is very
high. I think that you may assemble a system con-
sisting of some good digital Camera (eg Canon Power-
ShotG5), any hood and the appropriate commercially
available ﬁlters for about 1000 EURO. Hope this helps.
At Victoria University of Wellington a MSc and a Post-
doc documented their gels in this way. We simply
mounted a digital KODAK camera ( ~US$ 1000) on a
tripod and placed it over a transilluminator box. To
avoid diﬀuse UV radiation a plastic shade was cut out
of an old conference satchel, placed on top of the tran-
silluminator, leaving a rectangular window to place the
gels in. To visualise ethidium bromide stained gels we
bought a plastic orange ﬁlter at a photo shop in town.
We put a steel clamp next to the camera, clamped the
orange ﬁlter carefully with a bit of tissue and moved
it underneath the camera lens. Once the settings were
satisfactory, we left the whole set-up like this in our
dark room. The MSc student liked to score his gels
in negative, another useful option when using a digital
camera.
Yes there is such a system: put a cardboard box upside
down over a transluminator (UV), make a hole on what
is meant to be the bottom of the box, use a simple red
ﬁlter as those traditinnaly used with polaroid camera to
take EtBr stained DNA, put your cheap digital camera
over it, ideally on a stand. And Click! I don’t know if
this will work with EtBr but it does with Vista Green
(Amersham rpn5786, 10 ul per 1ml of loading blue; it
ties to the DNA and does not need to be added to the
gel itself).
A few years ago I was looking for the same thing you
are, a good and inexpensive gel documentation system
(price range $1000 - 2000). The cheapest that I know
about is a system from Kodak. One of the good thingsabout it is that the photos can be printed easily on
a laser printer. My understanding is that the paper
is more archival in quality than that found in fancier
systems.
I have used the Dark Reader system with a digital cam-
era. The box emits blue light and it has an orange cover
that goes over it. Cybr gold(Molecular Probes) stains
the DNA and shines through. It is as sensitive as ethid-
ium and less toxic. The box costs around $800(still
a little pricey, but maybe less than what you’ve been
looking at) and if you want to know where to get one,

Isoglossa Clonality Testing
Dear Evoldir members:
I am looking for an appropriate molecular technique to
use to assess the degree of clonality in one of my study
species, Isoglossa woodii (Acanthaceae). As an ecolo-
gist by training, it is diﬃcult to know where to start.
Literature searches have revealed that the only pub-
lished study on clonality in Acanthaceae used RAPDs
(Bush and Mulcahy. 1999. Molecular Ecology 8:865-
870.)
I would appreciate advise on what molecular technique
would be most appropriate for determining how exten-34 EvolDir January 1, 2004
sive clonal growth is in an understorey plant species.
I’ve had allozymes/isozymes and microsatellites recom-
mended to me and been dissuaded from using RAPDs
and ISSRs. I would like to ﬁnd something that is reli-
able but I also don’t necessarily have the funds, time,
laboratory facilities, or skills necessary to develop a re-
ally involved technique.
I’d also appreciate having some advise on how you
would recommend sampling the plants. Number of
plants is not a limiting issue; this species forms a dense
understory layer with about 20 stems per 1 m-squared.
I am working in one speciﬁc 5 km-square area but
the distribution of the species is more-or-less contin-
uous along Indian Ocean from Durban northward to
the Mozambique border (about 800 km). Should I try
to have a target number of samples in all areas along
that distribution? How does one deﬁne a population?
Also what storage techniques work best for that analy-
sis (both for the short and long term). I will be collect-
ing samples from the ﬁeld site. There are no immediate
storage facilities for freezing and it will take 4 hours to
travel between the ﬁeld site and the University where I
work.
Thank you in advance for your time and assistance with
this.

subfamilies: Planchonioideae, Napoleonaeoideae, Scy-
topetaloideae and Foetidioideae. I recognize that there
are diﬀerent ways to classify the Lecythidaceae. My
goal is to obtain samples for species closely related
to Amazonian Lecythidaceae genera such as Cory-
thophora, Lecythis, Couratari and Eschweilera.
Please contact me directly if you might be able to help.
I might be able to trade North American samples in
exchange. I will pay for the shipping. I would acknowl-
edge your assistance in any publications.
Thank you very much

taxonomy question
Mike, I haven’t run into you in a few years. Hope you
are still going strong n Zoology. I have a genetics ques-
tion for you.
I am investigating a lice problem in Oregon deer. It
appears that the deer in western Oregon have an exotic
lice on them and most likely the reason for the hair-loss
syndrome seen over the last few years. I am working
with a morphological taxonomist for biting lice and heJanuary 1, 2004 EvolDir 35
can identify the enus, subgenus, but is relatively certain
this is an undescribed species. I would like to follow up
on the identiﬁcation of this lice with a enetic compari-
son to conﬁrm genus and species.
Would you be able to do this type of work, or would
you be able to point me in the right direction. I realize
it would take some samples of knowns and unknowns
to do this work. These are available.

M13 primer use
Markus Schuelke published in Nature a method for re-
ducing costs of fragment analysis on ABI machines us-
ing a generic “M13” tail to cheap primers. Since it saves
costs, I would like to use this method, but I have a few
questions about its utility. Has anyone out there used
this method enough to give me feedback on some of the
potential pitfalls?
I am running microsattelites to determine parentage
on an ABI 3100. I have 9 primers, that I can divide up
pretty well into the 3 ﬂourescent dyes. Ones that share
a color are separated suﬃciently by fragment length to
resolve as diﬀerent loci in the results. My question is
primarily concerned with the PCR. I will certainly have
to do diﬀerent colors in diﬀerent PCR reactions, but I
was hoping that I might multi-plex single colors. What
this would involve is putting the 3 primers that I would
like to code with one color (say all should be FAM,
and each fragment diﬀers in length - 80bp, 150bp, and
190bp), in the PCR with the M13-dye and the tem-
plate DNA. Do you know of any problems associated
with this approach? My concern is that there will be
a much higher PCR failure due to binding errors be-
tween the M13 and the primers (since there are 3), or
that the primers might bind to eachother with the M13-
tails. With too many errors, I would be better oﬀ buy-
ing each of the primers already labeled so that I might
save on PCR costs (I have lots of samples!!) and can
eﬀectively multiplex in the fragment analysis. Regard-
less the M13 method certainly saves a llot of money in
the identiﬁcation of plymorphic primers (I started with
30 primers) and ﬁguring out the sizes of each in order
to determine how to multiplex them.Thanks for any tips you can give me! Alexis Chaine

Pheidole Ant SpecimensJanuary 1, 2004 EvolDir 37
Request for Pheidole ant specimens:
I am a graduate student at Harvard University under
the supervision of Dr. Naomi Pierce and Dr. Ed-
ward O. Wilson. My dissertation project involves re-
constructing the molecular phylogeny of ants from the
genus Pheidole.
Ants from the Pheidole genus belong to the tribe
Pheidolini (subfamily Myrmicinae) and are distributed
worldwide. In my attempt to sequence the DNA of
this genus, it is imperative that I have as many repre-
sentatives from the genus as possible. My main goal
is to understand the relationships among the species
in the New World Pheidole, although I am very inter-
ested in also attempting to understand the relationship
of the Old World Pheidole with that of the New World
species. I am therefore attempting to solicit the help of
people who have collected Pheidole ants to send them
for DNA work. I currently intend to base my analy-
sis on three gene regions (COI, COII and the wingless
nuclear gene).
In order to do the DNA analysis of the ants sent to
me, the ants need to have been preserved in 95% -100%
ethanol with complete collection information. It has
been my experience that any specimen that is over 10
years old has degraded at the molecular level and is
often unusable for molecular work. Since some Phei-
dole ants are extremely small, it is sometimes necessary
to use more than one ant to extract DNA, as long as
the ants are from the same colony. Again, if you were
able to send more than one individual ant, it would be
greatly appreciated. I would also request that you send
at least one major worker, as well as, several minor
workers, since many of the identiﬁcations rely on the
major caste.
Please help me acquire additional specimens from any
country (including the USA) you have or are planning
on collecting in. Also, I would greatly appreciate if you
would forward this message to colleagues whom you
think may be able to assist in the acquisition of spec-
imens, or supply me with their e- mail, facsimile, or
postal addresses. Ideally, I hope that at least two spec-
imens of each species could be supplied: the ﬁrst spec-
imen as a DNA sample, the second as a voucher for fu-
ture reference. Voucher specimens will be deposited at
the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard Uni-
versity.
Ants should be sent to the following address:

tive Zoology 26 Oxford Street Cambridge, MA 02138

Dear Nir,
we did genetic analyses on Euproctus asper mtDNA
and we never had any problems to extract DNA after
storing samples in 95% Ethanole. Samples were good
for more than 1 year without much loss of quality and
without storage in the freezer.
Another possibility we usedare buccal swabs. This
method works very good on bigger newts. If you are
interested in further information, do not hesitate to ask.

Hi Nir, our samples were stored in 95% EtOH at -

Dear Nir,I have no experience working on Salamandra,
however, from my own experienceworking on corals, I
can tell you that I have used ethanol preserved sam-
ples,for microsat analyses also, and I recommend plac-
ing the samples in the fridge,if you have space, and
change the ethanol regularly, if you can only keep the-
mat room temperature, they should be OK for at least
one year.Good luck!Marie.
Ok, you can prserve your samples best for several years
at -80deg C in 70% ethanol,to prevent degradation of
sample as well as DNA which can be ampliﬁed at anydesirus time,

Dear NirWe keep samples like yours in the fridge,
and they seem to be doing OK forat least >8 years.
In my opinion though, it is very important to make
surethat the tissue is in small enough pieces in a large
enough volume of EtOH,otherwise it will rot in the
tube!Just make sure you don’t hav e a large amount
of tissue stuﬀed in a tubewith only a token amount of
EtOH!!Best wishesSi Creer
Dear Nir,In relation to your DNA preservation ques-
tion, I have preserved rat tissue in 70% ethanol and
stored them in 1ml tubes kept in a cupboard at room
temperature (20-25 degrees Celsius) in our lab. I have
stored them this way for over 3 years and can still ob-
tain good DNA yields from all samples.Cheers,Craig
Dear Nir,I have been keeping and using reptiles and am-
phibian tissues for the last 6years and I allways kept my
tissues in 95% alcohol at room temperature(including
Salamandra) and they work ﬁne. I guess your sam-
ples will besafe just at room temperature. However, if
you have storage space in a 4degrees celsius chamber or
fridge it would be even better.Cheers,Salvi

Software Proﬁle Treeﬁnder
Dear All,
TREEFINDER has now an utility to compute rate pro-
ﬁles along sequence alignments, which might be useful if
one is investigating selective forces on DNA sequences.
Another new tool can calibrate phylogenetic trees in
time using Michael J. Sanderson’s nonparametric rate
smoothing method (NPRS). It outputs a chronogram
and also a ratogram with estimates of absolute evolu-
tionary rates.
Finally, the new version comes with a more informative
documentation on the TL programming interface.
As usual, the new version is available at
www.treeﬁnder.de and runs on Windows, Linux
and MacOS X.
By the way - I am looking for sponsors or a new job.

I have just uploaded a new version of Seq-Gen to our
web site:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software/seqgen/ Seq-Gen
is a program that will simulate the evolution of nu-
cleotide sequences along a phylogeny, using common
models of the substitution process. A range of models
of molecular evolution are implemented including the
general reversible model. Nucleotide frequencies and
other parameters of the model may be given and site-
speciﬁc rate heterogeneity may also be incorporated in
a number of ways. Any number of trees may be read
in and the program will produce any number of data
sets for each tree. Thus large sets of replicate simu-
lations can be easily created. It has been designed to
be a general purpose simulator that incorporates most
of the commonly used (and computationally tractable)
models of DNA sequence evolution.
The new version includes an improved the ran-
dom number generator - now uses the Mersenne
Twister (see http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/˜matumoto/-
emt.html ). Mac OS X version now includes a new
graphical user interface for Seq-Gen called “SGrunner”
written by Thomas P. Wilcox of the Long Key Tropical
Research Center, Florida. This is allows all Seq-Gen’s
settings to be controlled in a dialog box and the set-
tings can be saved as a ﬁle for repeated use. Thanks to

HETERO: A PROGRAM TO SIMULATE THE EVO-
LUTION OF DNA ON A FOUR-TAXON TREEJanuary 1, 2004 EvolDir 41
We present a computer program, Hetero, to simulate
the evolution of a nucleotide sequence on a phyloge-
netic tree with four tips. The program allows the user to
specify the lineage-speciﬁc nucleotide substitution mod-
els used in the simulation, together with information on
the ancestral sequence, and the order and timing of the
divergence events. Hetero has a simple user-interface
and output, making it equally useful in the teaching
and research of phylogenetics.
Hetero directs its output to two ﬁles and to the moni-
tor. One ﬁle contains the alignments of simulated nu-
cleotide sequences; they are stored in the sequential
PHYLIP format, allowing them to be analyzed directly
using the phylogenetic programs from the PHYLIP pro-
gram package. The other ﬁle contains the details used
in order to do the simulation, and information collected
during the simulation that may be used to obtain a bet-
ter understanding of molecular evolution as a dynamic
process and to understand why phylogenetic methods
do not always perform as well as expected.
A description of Hetero is published in Applied Bioin-
formatics 2:159-163 [2003].

Sponge samples
Dear all:
I’m a Ph.D. student and I’m looking for sponge species
of Hymedesmia and Phorbas genera (Poecilosclerida:
Hymedesmiidae) around the world.
I’ll be very greatful to people who can obtain any sam-
ple of these especies, althoug you don’t know exactly
the species name of the sample.
If there is someone who can help me please contact me.
Thank you very much

Tissue storage
Please be so kind and pass on the following message:
I need advice on tissue storage methods for later mRNA
extraction. The tissue I am using (beetle horn pri-
mordia) is small, so I need to accumulate a signiﬁcant
amount before a RNA extraction makes sense. So far
I have been using RNAlater, but with mixed results.
Often the tissue will not soak in the solution and will
not sink, even after centrifugation. As a next step I
will try to store the tissue directly in TRIZOL. I antic-
ipate storing the tissue for about 2-4 weeks. Please let
me know if you have any advice on this or alternative
approaches.
Many thanks

cDNA size
Please be so kind and pass on the message below.
Thank you!
Armin Moczek
I need advice on methods to size select a cDNA
pool. Thus far we have used ClonTech CHROMA spin
columns to size-select, but with mixed success. Often
the columns remove the selected size range only par-
tially, also remove large fragments, and have low yield.
I am dealing with small cDNA quantities and ideally
would like to use a method that minimizes loss of sam-
ple during the procedure. Unless I have no other choice
I would prefer not to use radioactive labeling and a drip
column as I have no experience in that. Any advice on
alternative methods that have worked for you in the
past would be terriﬁc!
Thanks!

cpDNA questions
I have used several of the universal cpDNA primers
published by Weising and Gardner (1999) for analysis
of a polyploid plant (Cerastium alpinum and related
species).January 1, 2004 EvolDir 43
First: For one of the primers (CCMP1) we got NO
products in about half of the individuals. We think
that it is not due to bad DNA template because the
same individuals give good products for all other primer
pairs. Could it be some mutation in the primer region,
though it should be rather conservative (“universal”
primers...)? How common is this phenomenon?
A second question: we got more than one “size-type” of
fragments ampliﬁed for some of these primers. We are
about to test oﬀspring to verify maternal inheritance -but how common is it with duplications in cpDNA? Or
reports of multiple clones of cpDNA in polyploids?

“We believed in the true classiﬁcation, the orgastic phy-logeny that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us
then, but that’s no matter – tomorrow we will sequence
more genomes, make more trees, run PAUP faster,
stretch out our arms further....And one ﬁne morning

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
ceaselessly into the past.”
DukeU Baboon Demography
Postdoctoral position:demographic analysis
An NSF-funded postdoctoral position in demographic
analysis is available in the lab of Susan Alberts at Duke
University. The position is initially for one year but is
potentially extendable to two or more years. Work will
focus on demographic analysis of the Amboseli baboon
population, using long-term data extracted from our
behavioral and demographic database. We have over
30 years of high quality demographic data on this pop-
ulation. We have completed a deterministic model of
population growth but seek to develop stochastic mod-
els; our preliminary stochastic models indicate substan-
tial variance in vital rates over time and we want to
pursue the implications of that variance. We also seek
to develop estimates of individual ﬁtness using demo-
graphic models as proposed by McGraw and Caswell
(1996). Applicants should have extensive experience
with demographic modelling and computer simulations.
The position is laboratory rather than ﬁeld-based, but
a trip to the ﬁeld site is possible. Start date is ﬂexible
but we would like someone to begin as soon as possible.
Please note that this postdoctoral position is diﬀerent
from the genetics position advertised last month. For
information about the research in the lab, visit http:/-
/www.biology.duke.edu/albertslab/, and for informa-
tion about the Amboseli Baboon Research Project visit

ATTENTION: Molecular evolutionists, parasitologists,
entomologists, and persons with GIS skills
We are looking for a person to ﬁll a 3-year NSF-
funded postdoctoral position to pursue molecular-based
investigations of coevolutionary relationships between
pocket gophers and their chewing lice. This project in-
vestigates a particularly complicated and species-rich
assemblage of lice and gophers in Mexico and incor-
porates GIS technology to investigate factors inﬂu-
encing louse distribution on hosts and host distribu-
tion over geography. The experimental design involves
molecular-based phylogenetic analysis, application of
GIS technology to host and parasite distributions, andoccasional ﬁeldwork in Mexico.
The successful applicant must have skills in molecu-
lar evolution (primer design, PCR ampliﬁcation, DNA
sequencing, and knowledge of phylogenetic analysis).
Beyond that, we seek a person with experience in GIS
analysis (ArcView, GARP analysis, etc.) or a gen-
uine motivation to learn these techniques, which will
be important tools in our eﬀort to use GIS to model
host-parasite coevolution. We especially encourage en-
tomologists and parasitologists to apply, as their in-
sect/parasite perspectives will complement the mam-
mal/host perspectives of the PIs on this project.
The position is available after March, 2004 and renewals
for the second and third years will be contingent on
progress and productivity. Review of applications is
ongoing and will continue until the position is ﬁlled.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in biology or a re-

UGeorgia Hybridization
Postdoctoral Associate - Hybridization and Speciation
I anticipate hiring a postdoctoral associate for a two-
four year appointment, with a start date as early as
March 15, 2004. My group conducts research in the ar-
eas of natural hybridization, evolutionary genetics and
speciation. Most of our research studies have involved
plant taxa. Current projects continue to emphasize
both natural and experimental populations, and ad-
dress conceptual issues from evolutionary biology and
ecology.
The successful candidate will have a strong background
in evolutionary biology and technical expertise in DNA
genotyping of plants. They will work with the PI and
graduate students in studying the eﬀects of QTL on the
ﬁtness of plants in natural microhabitats. They will
also carry out genotyping of plants from natural hy-
brid zones between the Louisiana Iris species, Iris fulva
and Iris brevicaulis. Each of the studies is designed
to reveal the factors that promote and limit introgres-
sive hybridization between these species. These studies
will thus test hypotheses concerning the evolutionary
importance of natural hybridization and the processes
leading to speciation.
Applications should arrive no later than February 1,
2004. Applicants should send a CV and a brief sum-
mary of research experience and interests. They should
also have at least two letters of recommendation sent to:

Valencia AsexualReproduction
Apr16-18
The workshop ’Origin and Spread of Asexuals’ will
be held 16-18 April 2004 in Valencia (Spain). The
workshop is organized in the frame of PARThenogen-
esis NetwoRk (PARTNER; http://www.nioo.knaw.nl/-
NETWORKS/PARTNER ), a network funded by the
European Science Foundation. We address to young
scientists starting an independent research career, post-
docs and advanced graduate students for inviting them
to attend the workshop.
The workshop is aimed to study the origin of asex-
ual reproduction from sexual ancestors and their main-
tenance and spread. The focus is on how molecular
mechanisms, reproductive cytological mechanisms, life-
history traits and population features may aﬀect the
origin and maintenance of asexuality. The workshop
will stress the link between proximate and evolutionary
causes of asexuality, using a comparative approach. As
a related topic, the origin, advantages and maintenanceof partial asexuality (e.g., cyclical parthenogenesis) will
be addressed. The following topics will be considered:
(1) Becoming asexual; (2) Cytological mechanisms to
produce asexual eggs and seeds; (3) Avoiding genomic
problems and evolving in the absence of sex (mutational
load, adaptativeness of asexuals to environmental nov-
elties); (4) Partial asexuality: advantage and instabil-
ity; (5) The fate of asexual taxa: dynamics aspects.
The workshop will consist of 12-14 talks given by senior
scientists, followed by discussion sessions. The expected
speakers are: Bengt Bengtsson, Charles King, Fabrice

scription of his/her current research topic (less than 400
words). The selection will be performed on the base of
research record and topic, and the scope of the Euro-
pean network.
The workshop organization will cover the accommoda-
tion costs in the facilities provided by the organization
for the invited attendants, but cannot cover their travel
expenses.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that56 EvolDir January 1, 2004
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
