Adelaide Conference on Mathematical Evolutionary Bi-
ology (April 20-24, 2009) and associated Grad student
Phylogenetics Workshop (April 13-17, 2009) Adelaide,
South Australia
The second annual Adelaide Conference on Mathe-
matical Evolutionary Biology (ACMEB) will be held
on Port Elliot beachfront, South Australia from April
20-24, 2009. This meeting follows the success-
ful inaugural meeting held in Blanche Cave, Nara-
coorte in 2008 ( http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/-
events/biomaths/Biomaths08.html ). The ACMEB se-
ries aims to bridge the current gap between biologists
and mathematicians in Australia, and overseas, by pro-
viding a relaxed, informal setting for the discussion of
new results and formation of trans-disciplinary collab-
orations. The emphasis is on the development and ap-
plication of advanced new analytical methods, and cur-
rent problems in evolutionary biology. The conference
is designed to allow maximum student and academic in-
teraction, and the analysis of datasets during the meet-
ing itself. Topics covered at the previous meeting in-
clude: Mathematical methods and Algorithms; Phylo-
genetics and Networks; Macroevolution; Evolutionary
rates and dates; Genome analysis; Bioinformatics; Hu-
man evolution; Disease. (A full list of abstracts from2008 is available ( http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/-
events/biomaths/biomaths08 abstrats.pdf ).
In a change to the 2008 conference format, there will
also be an associated Phylogenetics Workshop for post-
graduate students, run by the Australian Centre for
Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide from April
13-17 (Easter week). Workshop attendees are also en-
couraged to attend and present at the conference at
Port Elliot. The workshop will feature hands-on train-
ing from 4 international experts, in leading software
packages for the analysis of genetic data:
Prof. Mark Pagel, University of Reading; Dr. Alexi
Drummond, University of Auckland (BEAST); Prof.
Peter Lockhart, Massey University; and Christian An-
derson (Serial SimCoal).
The conference features a day devoted to data analy-
sis/recreation with scheduled activities around the Port
Elliot area including wine tours, beach activities, and
checking out local attractions. Important prizes at the
ACMEB include the highly coveted Napkin Award (for
the best mathematical solution to a biological problem
solved at the conference). Entries must be submitted
on the original napkin to allow artistic merit to be
considered. Check out the winners of the 2008 award

Center for Biodiversity and Conservation Milstein Sci-
ence Symposium American Museum of Natural History
New York City, New York, USA April 2 and 3, 2009
http://cbc.amnh.org/health Health and the environ-
ment are deeply intertwined for populations, species,
and ecosystems, as well as for human lives and liveli-
hoods. Human endeavors in agriculture, energy and
food production, transportation, and infrastructure de-
velopment can have far-reaching and signiﬁcant impact
on the health of humans and the environment. Under-
standing these relationships is increasingly critical in
the context of our changing world and the accelerating
loss of biodiversity.
This two-day conference will present a diversity of view-
points and experiences, spanning the natural, medical,
and social sciences, as well as policy planning. Pre-
senters will discuss knowledge/data gaps and the limi-
tations of current approaches, and examine innovative
methods that move beyond speculation to a grounded
understanding of impacts and realistic solutions. Par-
ticular emphasis will be placed on consideration of mul-
tiple and interacting stressors and decision making for
maximizing beneﬁts to both health and the environ-
ment.
CALL FOR POSTERS A limited number of posters
will be accepted for presentation during the Sympo-
sium. Posters that address any aspect of the relation-ship between health and the environment will be con-
sidered. Topics may include, but are not limited to:
- Links between the health of plants, wildlife, domes-
tic animals, and/ or humans - Anthropogenic drivers of
disease emergence - Environmental change and disease
ecology - Environmental change and pathogen evolution
- Pathogen discovery in natural reservoirs - Ecology of
host-pathogen interactions - Climate change and health
- Health-related ecosystem functions and services - En-
vironmental sustainability and health - Health and bio-
diversity conservation - Capacity building in environ-
ment and health
Poster Abstract Submission Deadline: January 30
Members of a Poster Selection Committee will deter-
mine which abstracts are to be accepted based on their
relevance and general level of interest.

AMERICAN GENETIC ASSOCIATION ANNUAL
SYMPOSIUM 2009
THE GENETICS AND GENOMICS OF ENVIRON-
MENTAL CHANGE 8-11 JUNE 2009 BROWN UNI-
VERSITY, PROVIDENCE RI
OVERVIEW OF THE SYMPOSIUM Environmental
change has been a constant challenge for all organisms
in the history of life on earth. In the thousands of
years since the last glacial maximum, organisms have
been forced to adapt to a changing climate. The strik-
ing environmental variation we observe from the poles
to the equator, from season to season, and from day
to night have been met by both physiological and evo-
lutionary adaptations that enable organisms to survive
and reproduce. In recent years there has been growing
interest and concern over how humans are imposing en-
vironmental change on the planet, and how organisms
are responding to that change. Environmental change
means very diﬀerent things to diﬀerent biologists, yet
few would deny that the genetic and genomic mecha-
nisms of adaptation to this change are central problems
in biology.
The goals of the AGA Symposium for 2009 are to ex-
amine environmental change from the perspective of
genetics and genomics. Leading researchers in evolu-
tionary, population, and quantitative genetics will dis-
cuss how these ﬁelds integrate with ecological and ge-
ological perspectives on climate change. The sympo-
sium will run over three days, with morning and after-
noon sessions featuring invited speakers, and an evening
poster session that is open to all attendees. Sessionswill be reserved for graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers to present their work, as selected from the
list of poster abstracts.
The conference will be held at Brown University in
Providence Rhode Island. A clambake at the Blithe-
wold mansion on the shores of Narragansett Bay will
be held on the second evening and provides an oppor-
tunity for meeting attendees to converse in a relaxed
and pastoral setting.
Some funds will be available to graduate students and
postdocs on a competitive basis to defray the cost of
attending the meeting.

Gainesville SEEC 2009 Mar27-29
The 2009 Southeastern Ecology and Evolution Confer-
ence will feature presentations from undergrad, grad,
and postdoc students in the ﬁelds mentioned in the ti-
tle. Seeing as how you manage a directory full of people
conducing research in these areas, could you please for-
ward the following message to all the email addresses
you have? Thank you.
If you’re an undergrad, grad, or postdoc conducting
research related to ecology and/or evolution, you’re in-
vited to present at the aptly titled Southeastern Ecol-
ogy and Evolution Conference (SEEC).
The SEEC is a professional, regional conference or-
ganized by students, for students. Students from UF
and other southeastern schools will share their research
in talks and poster sessions at this exciting (science!
awards for best talks/posters!) conference as well as
enjoy keynote talks by UF faculty, social events, and
optional ﬁeld trips.
This upcoming conference will be the 6th one and the
ﬁrst to be hosted by UF. It will take place from March
27, 2009 to March 29 with the joint hosting of the 32nd
Herpetology Conference at the Paramount Plaza Hotel
located at 2900 SW 13th Street, Gainesville, FL 32608.
Now that you know what the SEEC is, feel free to
submit your abstracts to seec2009@gmail.com . *Keep
your submissions to no more than 250 words; the ten-
tative deadline is January 6, 2009. Any abstracts even
loosely related to ecology/evolution suﬃce.* We will
then read and categorize them into subjects such as
biodiversity, animal behavior, conservation, functional
morphology, population ecology, etc. and respond once
we’ve approved what we’ve read. Be sure to include
contact info in your email and your preference of an
oral or poster presentation.
Registration should open sometime in the latter half of
December, along with a website with more information
such as costs and procedures. We’ll keep in touch with
you once you’ve submitted an abstract.
SEEC 2009 <seec2009@gmail.com >HumboldtU Innovations in
phylogenetics Mar4-7
The international conference “Celebrating Darwin:
From The Origin of Species to Deep Metazoan Phy-
logeny” brings together mathematicians, theorists,
molecular systematists, and morphologists interested in
a critical review of known pitfalls and in the presenta-
tion of new analytical tools, new types of characters,
and a synopsis of molecular and morphological charac-
ters. It is intended to get a critical and constructive
view of the state of the art. If you want to go beyond
the routine analyses that in the past produced so many
conﬂicting hypotheses, and if you are not a believer but
a critical researcher, this is the opportunity to exchange
new ideas for alternative ways to analyze deep phylo-
genies.
On behalf of the organising committee we would like
to invite you to this conference, which will take place
from 4th - 7th March 2009 at the Humboldt-University
and the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, Germany.
The meeting will consist of sessions with several invited
speakers and open sessions with short presentations. In
addition, there will be the possibility to show posters.
The meeting focuses on three major themes:
1) Innovations in analyses of molecular and morpholog-
ical data
2) Molecular phylogeny: new markers and phyloge-
nomic analyses
3) The indispensability of morphology
The conference is organised by the Priority Program
“Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” of the German Science
Foundation (DFG). The project brings together molec-
ular, morphological and bioinformatic expertise with
the goal to establish a robust (hopefully) backbone
tree of metazoans. Details on the priority program
“Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” can be found at: http://-
www.deep-phylogeny.org/ . For more information and

extended deadlines
Dear Colleagues,
The e-Biosphere 09 International Conference on
Biodiversity Informatics (see www.e-biosphere09.org
<blocked:: http://www.e-biosphere09.org/ >) will take
place in London on 1-5 June 2009. The Conference will
be devoted to:
* Highlighting the accomplishments and capabilities
of Biodiversity Informatics; * Sharing information and
demonstrations of databases and software; and * Gath-
ering input from researchers and users on the directions
that Biodiversity Informatics should take in the next 5-
10 years.
Input from the Conference will go directly into a two-
day planning meeting of major Biodiversity Informatics
initiatives. This input will inform their R&D roadmap
and help them develop priorities for implementation
and funding.
To enable the communities of researchers and users
in Biodiversity Informatics to prepare properly for the
Conference, the organizers announce:
1. Creation of an Online Conference Forum (OCF).
The OCF will be a web-based environment in which
research and user communities can interact, hold e-
discussions, exchange documents, and communicate in
various ways. It will become operational early in Jan-
uary 2009 and we will send an announcement when it
is ready for use. The Forum will begin with the follow-
ing pre-constructed communities, but OCF participants
will be able to merge and split communities and to form
new communities.
* Developing world * Conservation and land use * Agri-
culture, forestry, ﬁsheries, and economic development *
Public Health * Ecology and ecosystems, environmen-
tal sustainability, climate change * Taxonomic groups
* Uses in public, K-12 and higher education * Basic
biodiversity science research * Training in biodiversity
informatics * Citizen science * A future road map for
Biodiversity Informatics
One session at the Conference will be devoted to par-
allel discussion sessions of the ten most active online
communities. These discussion sessions will enable par-
ticipants to ﬁnalize their vision of where BiodiversityInformatics needs to develop. These discussion groups
will be encouraged to submit group-authored Position
Papers to the Conference Proceedings volume.
2. Extension of Conference deadlines. The Conference
organizers hope that the OCF will stimulate lots of
ideas and interactions that will show up at the Con-
ference as innovative poster abstracts, demonstrations
of databases and software, discussion groups, and side-
events. To let this process of communication have
the greatest possible impact, Conference deadlines have
been revised to the latest possible dates:
* 15 January 2009: Launch of the Online Confer-
ence Forum (OCF) * 1 March 2009: Deadline for
submission of poster abstracts <blocked:: http:/-

Dear colleagues,
The International Conference on Polyploidy, Hybridiza-
tion and Biodiversity ICPHB2009 will take place at the
Palais du Grand Large, Saint-Malo (France) on 17-20
may 2009.
The recent years have seen signiﬁcant advances in un-
derstanding the consequences of reticulate evolution
and genome duplication that appear a major feature
of eukaryotic lineages. The meeting aims at promoting
knowledge exchanges and discussions on the latest de-
velopments concerning these major drivers of genome
shaping and speciation. A wide range of topics will
be covered such as the consequences of polyploidy on
biodiversity, hybrid and polyploid speciation, meiosis
and fertility in polyploid species, genome evolution and
structure, transposable elements and DNA methyla-
tion, epigenetics and gene regulation, heterosis, pheno-
typic variation ... Registration is now open at http://-
www.icphb2009.univ-rennes1.fr/ , oral and / or poster
contributions are welcome.
Saint-Malo is a beautiful and well-known medieval city
on the NW coast of France (Brittany region). It is vis-
ited by thousands of tourists every year due to its his-
torical centre, attractive coasts and magniﬁcent land-
scapes. We are looking forward to seeing you in Saint-
Malo, France in May 2009!

Turin ESEB 2009 parasite evolution
Aug24-29
We are inviting abstract submissions for oral and poster
presentations in the symposium “Integrating ecology
with parasite evolution” to be held on August 28
2009 at the European Society for Evolutionary Biology
(ESEB) meeting in Turin, Italy (August 24-29 2009).
Abstracts should be submitted online at http://-
www.eseb2009.it/uk/ by February 15 2009.
DESCRIPTION OF SYMPOSIUM: The enormous
abundance of parasites and their eﬀects on wild popu-
lations, agriculture and human health have given rise to
a rapidly growing ﬁeld centered on using evolutionary
principles to understand infectious disease. This ﬁeld
does not only signiﬁcantly contribute to our general un-
derstanding of evolutionary theory, but also has the po-
tential to provide new ways of tackling disease.The last
few decades have seen much progress in understanding
general evolutionary processes in parasite biology, and
have also revealed the important role of genetic inter-
actions between hosts and parasites. However, much
less attention has been paid to the eﬀect of the ecologi-
cal conditions under which hosts and parasites interact.
This is a serious problem, because empirical studies are
increasingly showing that in-host and external environ-
mental factors (e.g. temperature, host diet and the
presence of competitors) can shape parasite virulence,
life-histories, within-host dynamics and transmission.
The aim of this symposium is to bring together the-
oreticians and empiricists to explore how ecology in-
ﬂuences the evolution of parasites. This will not only
advance understanding of the basic processes by which
parasites evolve, but also provide a basis to predict the
consequences of human interventions on infectious dis-
ease.

Dear colleague,
Mathematical Models in Ecology and Evolution 2009
will be held at the University of Bristol on September
10th-11th 2009. Following the great success of the inau-
gural meeting in 2007 at Sussex, the 2009 meeting will
have a Darwinian ﬂavour, in honour of the bicentenary
of Darwin’s birth, and 150 years since the publication
of The Origin of Species. While not a mathematician
himself, Darwin’s ideas ﬁnd natural expression in the
form of mathematical models, allowing further devel-
opment and reﬁnement of the theory. MMEE 2009
will showcase the latest developments of formal mod-
els in evolution and ecology, and will include keynote
addresses on the mathematical modelling of Darwin’s
key theories and insights from:
- Professor Rob Boyd, Department of Anthropology,
University of California Los Angeles - Professor Alan
Grafen, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford -
Professor Hanna Kokko, Department of Biological and
Environmental Science, University of Helsinki - Profes-
sor Franjo Weissing, Department of Biology, University
of Groningen
Abstracts of no longer than 250 words should be sent
to James.Marshall@bristol.ac.uk by June 12th 2009.
The organisers welcome abstracts for talks and posters
(please indicate your preference if you have one). Regis-
tration details and accommodation information will be
announced in the New Year, and posted on the confer-
ence website: www.cs.bris.ac.uk/mmee2009 As space
at the conference venue is strictly limited, and we ex-
pect a high level of interest, participants will be asked
to register early to avoid disappointment.

INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY, COOPERATIVENESS
AND CONSEQUENCES OF PARTNER CHOICE
Project leader Markus ˜A-st
Like humans, animals too have personalities, some of
them being bold and brave, while others are shy and
softy. These diﬀerences have traditionally been ex-
plained away as noise surrounding adaptive population-
average behaviour. Recent theory has aimed at adap-
tively explaining this variability. However, little is
known about whether personality aﬀects the tendency
to cooperate with others, and whether the mixture of
personality types in socially breeding groups has ﬁtness
consequences. These open questions can best be ad-
dressed by an integrative approach, since genetics and
individual state inﬂuence endocrine mechanisms that
govern behaviour.
This four-year project funded by Academy of Finland
aims to 1) demonstrate the existence of personalities,
2) relate personality and physiological stress response
to parental care strategy and parental quality and state
and 3) explore the distribution of personalities in coop-
erative groups and its ﬁtness consequences. The model
species is the eider duck (Somateria mollissima), where
females show a variety of parental care strategies, rang-
ing from solo care to joint care with other females.Fecal steroid analyses are ideal for studying hormone-
behaviour relationships. It has previously been shown
that stress responses relate to personalities and domi-
nance. We will quantify individual quality, dominance,
boldness, activity, exploratory behaviour and physio-
logical social stress response, as judged by fecal gluco-
corticoid metabolites (GCMs) before and after choosing
parental care strategy. This deﬁnes individuals on the
’boldness-shyness’ personality axis.
Field work will take place at Tv¨ arminne Zoological
Station, SW Finland, in a long-term, individually-
marked study population. The biochemical analyses
(immunoassay) will be conducted abroad. The doc-
toral student will be based at Eken¨ as, Finland, joining
the interdisciplinary ARONIA Coastal Zone Research
Team established in 2008. The new Eken¨ as campus cre-
ates an inspirational setting for supervision and train-
ing, and the candidate will be enrolled at Ebo Akademi
University.
HOW TO APPLY
We are looking for a self-motivated person with a Mas-
ter’s Degree, able to work both independently and in a
team. The position is open from early 2009 (with some
ﬂexibility) until the end of 2012. The thesis work will
be supervised by Dr. Markus ˜A-st together with a post-
doc. The position is open to anyone with an interest
in behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology or physi-
ological ecology. Previous experience of ﬁeld and lab
work, good knowledge of statistics and proﬁcient writ-
ing skills in English are desirable qualiﬁcations. The
salary will be paid according to the guidelines of Ebo

EvolutionaryGenomics
I am seeking a highly motivated graduate student inter-
ested in ecological and evolutionary genomics research.
We have two major ongoing projects in my lab.
1. Comparative Evolutionary Genomics of Physiolog-
ical Plasticity: Some species can change their pheno-
type to compensate for broad changes in environmen-
tal conditions, whereas other species have narrow toler-
ance ranges. Gene regulatory mechanisms are likely to
underpin this physiological plasticity. We seek to de-
ﬁne the transcriptomic basis of a universally important
compensatory response (acclimation to osmotic stress)
for several taxa of ﬁsh that vary in their ability to tol-
erate stress based both on laboratory studies and on
habitat distributions in nature. Evolutionary compar-
ative analyses of variation in transcriptomic responses
are being used test for gene regulatory diﬀerences that
account for species diﬀerences in physiological plastic-
ity.
2. Genomic Basis of Rapid Convergent Pollution Tol-
erance. Multiple populations of the killiﬁsh Fundulus
heteroclitus have independently evolved to tolerate ex-
traordinarily high concentrations of PCB contaminants.
This system provides an excellent template to explore
fundamental evolutionary questions including “what isJanuary 1, 2009 EvolDir 17
the genomic and physiological basis of rapid adapta-
tion?” and “is the genomic basis of adaptation the
same in parallel-evolved populations?”. We are taking
three top-down approaches to addressing these ques-
tions. First, we are using QTL mapping of hybrid
crosses between multiple tolerant and sensitive popula-
tions to determine how many loci involved, and whether
the same loci are implicated in diﬀerent tolerant popu-
lations. Second, we are genotyping many wild individu-
als from multiple populations using thousands of mark-
ers for association studies to determine outlier loci: a
“population genomics” approach. Third, we are using
transcriptome proﬁling of PCB-challenged ﬁsh to de-
termine what the individuals from tolerant populations
are doing diﬀerently at the functional level to enable
tolerance, compared to individuals from sensitive pop-
ulations.
Appropriate tangents to these projects are possible and
encouraged for Ph.D. studies.

OxfordU AvianSignalEvolution
A three-year studentship is available in the Department
of Zoology, Oxford University, starting October 2009.
Project: A global analysis of birdsong to investigate the
role of signal evolution in speciation
Supervisors: Dr Joseph Tobias & Dr Nathalie Seddon
Deadline for application: 16th Feb 2009
Eligibility: UK or EU students only
Animal signals play a central role in mediating mate
choice and reproductive isolation. Understanding the
evolutionary processes shaping these signals, and driv-
ing their divergence, is therefore a key step towards re-
solving a long-standing puzzle in biology: how species
multiply and co-exist.
This PhD will use comparative methods to test evolu-
tionary hypotheses. These include the ecological adap-
tation hypothesis (EAH), which holds that signals and
associated preferences diverge, and reproductive isola-
tion arises, via adaptation to the transmission proper-
ties and/or noise regimes of diﬀerent habitats. Oth-
ers include the cultural evolution hypothesis (CEH),
whereby signal divergence is a by-product of learning,
and the species recognition hypothesis (SRH), which
predicts that species in sympatry will be more divergent
than those in allopatry. Further hypotheses deal with
trade-oﬀs or synergisms between diﬀerent signalling
modalities. These ideas have been examined theoret-
ically, but empirical studies have thus far been limitedby small sample sizes or the inability to control for evo-
lutionary age.
Passerine birds oﬀer an ideal opportunity to overcome
these limitations. Capitalising on recent growth in digi-
tal birdsong archives, sound analysis software and phy-
logenetics, this project involves quantifying song and
plumage traits of 1000+ passerine species and mapping
them onto avian phylogenies. This will allow signal di-
vergence and elaboration to be calculated, and related
to factors such as evolutionary age, ecology, biogeog-
raphy, signal multimodality, degree of song learning,
and rates of species accumulation (i.e. cladogenesis).
The student will receive training in the use compara-
tive methods and meta-analyses to conduct broad-scale
empirical tests of evolutionary hypotheses.
The results will shed light on some outstanding ques-
tions in evolutionary biology, including the dynamics of
multimodal signaling networks, and the relative roles of
deterministic processes (selection) and stochastic pro-
cesses (drift) in signal evolution and speciation.

ULondon GeographicProﬁling
Applications are invited for a PhD studentship in theSchool of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen
Mary, University of London with Dr Steven Le Comber,
on a project entitled Geographic proﬁling and the origin
of invasive species
Invasive species are signiﬁcant drivers of environmental
change and may soon surpass habitat loss as the main
cause of environmental degradation. The most eﬀec-
tive way to deal with invasive species is to attempt to
eradicate or at least contain them before they spread.
Here, we propose the use of a technique from crimi-
nology that has the potential to dramatically improve
the eﬃciency with which invasive species can be located
during the early stages of an invasion, when control ef-
forts are more likely to be eﬀective.
Geographic proﬁling (GP) is a statistical technique that
was originally developed as a tool in criminology. It
uses the location of related crime sites to make infer-
ences about the most likely area in which the oﬀender
might live, and has been extremely successful in this
ﬁeld. Its recent application to biological data was pio-
neered by Dr SC Le Comber at QMUL, in collaboration
with the techniques inventor, Prof DK Rossmo (Texas
State). Here, we aim to extend our earlier work to the
study of the spread of invasive species, by demonstrat-
ing the ability of GP to identify the source of invasions.
Our objectives are: To show how GP may be used
during the early stages of invasion, when control ef-
forts are likely to be most eﬀective, to accurately de-
termine the source of the invasion. To simulate the
spread of invasive species using both spatially explicit
population simulation models (SEPM) and non-spatial
models, and to quantify the improvement relative to
other types of search when data derived from diﬀerent
models are analysed. To determine whether GP can be
used during later stages of invasions, when sites that
have previously been colonised by invasive species act
as multiple sources for colonisation.

UNottingham SnailEvolution
Funding is available for a PhD studentship, to be
awarded on a competitive basis within the School of
Biology, University of Nottingham, to investigate the
evolution and/or development of sinistral snailsSinistral (anticlockwise-coiling) snails make up much
less than 10% of all snail species. Why are sinistral
snails so rare and how do they evolve? Are sinistrals
a perfect mirror image of dextrals, or are there ﬁtness
consequences of being sinistral? How is the left-right
asymmetry of the shell inherited, and at the molecu-
lar level, what is the hypothetical F-molecule that ulti-
mately determines asymmetry?
We are establishing the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis
as a comparative model organism for the understand-
ing of left-right asymmetry. With BBSRC funding, and
in collaboration with Prof Mark Blaxter (Edinburgh,
Solexa/454 sequencing, bioinformatics), we have just
begun a project to characterise the Lymnaea ’chirality’
locus, with the ultimate aim to understand the evo-
lution and development of asymmetry at the molecu-
lar level. As the lab is also investigating molluscan
asymmetry from behavioural, evolutionary and popu-
lation genetic perspectives, there is a wide scope for
PhD project in any of these areas.
Applicants should have, or expect to receive, a good
degree in a relevant subject, and an interest and en-
thusiasm for evolution. Students will experience a va-
riety of ’core’ methods, depending upon interests and
aptitude (e.g. molecular lab techniques, in situ hy-
bridization, micromanipulation, ﬁeld work, ultrahigh-
throughput DNA sequencing).
In the ﬁrst instance, prospective students should send
a CV and an indication of general area of interest to
angus.davison@nottingham.ac.uk.

some theory utilises hormonal reversal of sex and skew-
ing sex-ratio to control animal population size. In this
project, we will investigate the ﬁtness of sex-reversed
individuals and their oﬀspring (trans- generational ef-
fects). We will also conduct behavioural experiments
for mate choice and intra- and inter-speciﬁc aggression
in these individuals. Furthermore, we will use computer
simulations (individual- based modelling) to integrate
all observed parameters to predict outcomes of the ap-
plication of this theory in the real world. The student
will be encouraged to explore their own ideas.

Dear Evoldir,
We are seeking applicants for a PhD position at the
School of Biology, University of St Andrews.
EVOLUTION OF ANIMAL GENE CLUSTERS
There are an increasing number of instances of genes
operating in clusters in animal genomes, particularly
during development. The Hox gene cluster, that pat-
terns animal anterior-posterior axis development, is the
best known example. The rapidly increasing numberof genome sequences provides a valuable resource for
understanding these gene clusters, which will be exam-
ined to better understand genome evolution and its re-
lationship with animal evo-devo. It is expected that the
project will have a strong bioinformatics component, at
least in the initial stages, with the prospect for moving
into the lab as the project progresses.

*PhD position in biodiversity research (3 years, begin-
ning in March 2009)*
*Application deadline: January 15th, 2009 *
*Task* As members in a new Bavarian research network
(BAYFORKAST) we will investigate the threats posed
to plant-pollinator by the ongoing climatic change. The
project will be carried out in close cooperation with
partners from the universities in Bayreuth and Regens-
burg. The project primarily necessitates the develop-
ment of mathematical and spatially explicit simulation
models linking theory with empirical data. To get ac-
quainted with the real system ±the candidate will, how-
ever, participate in ﬁeld studies of pollinating insects
(especially bees, hoverﬂies, and butterﬂies) carried out
with our partners. These studies will take place along
an elevation gradient in the Bavarian national park
“Berchtesgadener Land”.
*Proﬁle* We seek a candidate with a pronounced inter-
est in mathematical and/or computer based modelling
of ecological processes. At least a basic knowledge in
some programming language (e.g. C, Pascal, Basic,
Fortran, R) will be helpful. We expect good commu-
nication skills and the ability to work in a team. The
candidate should have a master (or comparative level)in the natural sciences, preferentially in biology. How-
ever, candidates from physics, mathematics, or infor-
matics with a strong interest in ecology and evolution
may also apply.
The candidate will work at the Field Station Fab-
rikschleichach (a facility of the University W1rzburg,
Germany). A drivers licence (and a own car) will be
helpful for the ﬁeld work .

Ubern: ﬁeld assistants bird evolutionary ecologyWe are seeking 4 enthusiastic ﬁeld assistants inter-
ested in taking part in 2 ﬁeld studies in Bern, Switzer-
land. Applicants will be part of the evolutionary ecol-
ogy team (Zoological Institute, Bern University). Our
study model is a passerine bird, the great tit. The tits
are a good model system as they are hole nesting birds,January 1, 2009 EvolDir 31
breeding in forests near Bern, and as they can be eas-
ily manipulated. We are part of a 10 people lab team,
all working with great tits in natural conditions. We
work with about 300 nest boxes for each, disposed in
several forests close to Bern. The ﬁrst study aims to in-
vestigate the eﬀect of oxidative stress on sperm quality
as well as a potential heritability of these traits in the
great tit. This experiment will be conducted by Sylvain
Losdat (PhD). The second experiment is interested in
the eﬀects of maternal hormones on oﬀspring ﬁtness
and will be performed by Katarzyna Podlas (PhD). We
will require 2 ﬁeld assistants for each experiment that
will help with all the aspects of the work, including
checking nests, ringing the birds, catching adults, per-
forming treatments, and more. Applicants with a Msc
in Biology/Ecology and/or with bird handling experi-
ence would have an advantage. Supervising for poten-
tial Msc analysis and report would be assured by PhD
and Post-doc people from the lab. Motivation will play
a key role: the work is hard and demanding, may take
place in changing weather and requires long hours at
times. The study will start at the end of March 2009
until the beginning of June 2009. Fluent English or
French speaking is required as well as a valid European
driving license.

CNRS France EvolutionaryBiology
Dear all
This is to inform you about an attractive job oﬀer in
France ’ the yearly announcement of researcher po-
sitions ﬁnanced by the French Funding Organization
Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS).
These are *life-time 100 % research* positions of-
fered in an international competition to excellent can-
didates. The web page is http://www.sg.cnrs.fr/-
drhchercheurs/concoursch/default-en.htm . Posts are
available, for instance in Continental Surfaces and In-
terfaces (which includes landscape ecology), Biodiver-
sity, evolution and biological adaptations: from macro-
molecules to communities, and Biological systems mod-
elization, bioinformatics. The deadline, regrettably, is
January, 6.
THE TYPES OF POSTS (see also http://-
www.sg.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/pdf/-
metier-en.pdf, including salaries): There are charg´ es
de recherche, 2nd and 1st degree, 2nd and 1st degree
directeurs de recherch´ e, i.e. Associate Scientists after
dissertation and after some years of postdoctoral
experience, and Senior Scientists after about 8 or more
years years of experience, respectively. *However*,
please note that the announced posts of directeurs
de recherche do not seem to exist (except in the case
of very exceptional applications). These posts are de
facto only for promotion of people that already have
a position of a charg´ e de recherche within CNRS.
According to my experience already the Charg´ es de
Recherche are actually free to do what they wantwithin an overall, very large disciplinary category
(there are some 40 categories deﬁned for all sciences
together).
The competition for such positions is becoming increas-
ingly tough, in particular in the section 29 Biodiver-
sity, evolution and biological adaptations: from macro-
molecules to communities. Even though strange things
are happening, multiple ﬁrst or senior authored pub-
lications per year each with an impact factor of 4 or
more seem to be useful, and Nature, Science, PNAS
are highly appreciated. Further criteria (in French) are
given at http://www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/sections/-
critere/section29.htm THE PROFILES If you
go to http://gestionoﬀres.dsi.cnrs.fr/fo/oﬀres/default-
en.php you will ﬁnd a number of posts oﬀered, e.g. in
the in the sections 20, 29, 45. Note that by further
clicking on the numbers given to the jobs (e.g. N29/02)
you will ﬁnd that the Charg´ e positions (Associate Sci-
entists) are often focused to quite restricted ﬁelds of
research. This is where often science politics comes
into play. But sometimes the proﬁles only indicate a
preference in case two equally strong candidates show
up. Very strong candidates that have little to do with
a published proﬁle may in cases be preferred over weak
candidates that perfectly match a proﬁle, in particular
in competitive sections.
THE RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE.
Deadline for applications is, regrettably, January 6.. A
visit to the lab after having submitted the application
seems to be very much expected in all cases. Generally,
French institutions *do not* reimburse candidates the
travel costs to visit labs or to come to interviews etc..
Yes, this is a shame. I hope we have some funds here
at Rennes, but this is not sure.
After having applied *all* candidates will be invited
to a short presentation and an interview in Paris in
spring 2009. Travel costs will *not* be reimbursed by
the CNRS, but at the level of host Units funds may be
available. Presentations and interviews can be in En-
glish, French is possibly a plus. These interviews are a
major eﬀort for both, the candidates, the local labs and
the national recruitment committees. For people from
abroad it is thus strongly advised to apply only if they
are convinced of their CVs.
I PERSONALLY COULD OFFER help in putting to-
gether an application for qualiﬁed candidates with a
project willing to choose University of Rennes 1 and
to work here (at least partly) on the interface between
ecology and phylogeny (preferably of plants) or, alter-
natively, on the community assembly, diversity and di-
versiﬁcation (preferably of arthropods in the canopy).

and running until around the end of May 2009. Appli-
cants with a BSc/Msc in Biology/Ecology and with bird
handling experience would have an advantage. How-

AFLP protocols
Dear Evoldir members,
I am a Postdoctoral fellow, planning to start a new
project on population genetics on insect pathogens in-
cluding fungi & microsporidia. I have a lot of experi-
ence with genotyping microsatellites with Genotyper,
but I never worked with AFLP. I would appreciate if
anyone send me the working protocol for AFLP and
also advice me about the instruments/software to buy
for AFLP analysis. Please send your reply as soon as
possible
Thanks Johny

Arlequin mismatch answer
Question
I have a question about the calculation of the mismatch
distribution using the Arlequin 3.11 software package.
In their article, Schneider and Excoﬃer (1999), strongly
suggest to take into account rate heterogeneity and nu-
cleotide mutation correction models when calculating a
mismatch distribution. Especially in the case where the
parameters Tau and Theta is going to be used and the
validity of inferring a demographic expansion is tested.44 EvolDir January 1, 2009
However, in Arlequin it seems that the only distance op-
tion available is a Pairwise diﬀerence with no gamma
correction.
Although, I have seen articles that say that they used
correction models such as K2P and modiﬁed alpha
values when calculating mismatch distributions in Ar-
lequin.
Is there a way that one can incorporate these correc-
tions in your data using Arlequin?
Any suggestions will be much appreciated
Thank you
Carina Schlebusch
Answer
I received a reply from one of the developers of Ar-
lequin, which solved my problems. The correction is
not available in the Arlequin package but is available
on request from the authors
Prof. Excoﬃer’s email is pasted below
Thank you very much
—–
yes, this is correct that no correction for multiple hits
is done in Arlequin. However I have a program im-
plementing the computations described in Schneider
and Excoﬃer (1999) that is available upon request
Mismatch analysis take much longer time when mul-
tiple hits are allowed because we need to do some pre-
liminary computations (h coeﬃcients). However, we
have noticed that unless the shape parameter of the
gamma distribution of mutation rates was very small
(i.e. alpha <0.2), the estimations were to those result-
ing from an analysis without any correction.
Some people have asked for it and used it, and you are
welcome to do it
Best wishes

BIOSYS-2 and FREQPARS
Does anyone know where one can get hold of old phylo-genetic programmes (speciﬁcally BIOSYS-2 and FRE-
QPARS) or at least the executables for these? I have
trawled the web and none of the ftps seem to be op-
erational anymore. I am trying to repeat an analysis
of some data using BIOSYS-2 that had worked previ-
ously (and works ﬁne on BIOSYS-1). I’m beginning to
suspect that my executable may be corrupt.

Bryophyte phylogeny genes
Dear all,
I am doing a molecular phylogeny of a bryophyte genus
and for that purpose I’m looking for informative nu-
clear regions expect ITS region. GapC/Cp as well as
GapA/B seem to be promissing regions regarding the
few litterature (e.g. Stone, 2006).
But primers and sequences on NCBI are rare and PCR
do not amplify well !
Do you have any advices using theses genes for phy-
logeny purpose ? Do you know other nuclear regions
that can ﬁt ?
Thanks in advance, and best whishes for this new year,

CytochromeC primers
Dear Evoldir members,
We wish to PCR amplify the nuclear-encoded cy-
tochrome c gene (known as CYC) from various inver-
tebrates. We have looked for available primers with
published sequences, but the results were discouraging.
Are there any people working with this gene? Could
they provide some primers that could serve as a start-
ing point? All responses and suggestions will be greatly
appreciated. Thank you in advance.

alignment
Dear EvolDir,
I’m having problems with the following and hope you
may be able to help.
I would like to identify identical sequences (haplotypes)
in an alignment ﬁle, which contains ca 700 sequences
from the same species, many of which are the same.
I have previously used the program DNAsp on a pc,
but am now a mac user. I found DNAsp problematic
because the program renames the sequences H1-Hx, so
you manually have to ﬁnd the names of the sequences
in the original ﬁle, which takes forever and is prone to
mistakes when working with 700 sequences. Also, the
program does not accept ambiguous nucleotides, which
means the input-ﬁle has to be reformatted every time
one wants to use the program. This is also time con-
suming and prone to mistakes. As I work with ancient
DNA, many sites are initially ambiguous.
So I’m looking for a program for mac which can:
1. deﬁne haplotypes in an alignment 2. convert ambigu-
ous bases in the alignment to N 3. provide an output
ﬁle with the haplotype sequences only (eg in nexus) 4.
provide an output with a list of which sequences belong
to each haplotype
I hope you may be able to help.

DNA preservation liquids
G’day folks
I was wondering if folks have any experience with pre-
serving DNA in the ﬁeld in liquids other than ethanol?
My target organisms are ﬁshes, but I’m sure diﬀerent
liquids work on most groups just ﬁne. It some parts of
the world ethanol can be very diﬃcult and/or expensive
to obtain. Are there any good viable alternatives that
can be obtained in third world countries that should be
ok that people have experience with? Isopropanol is of-
ten available it seems, but I’ve only seen one report that
suggested it should be ok. Also, I guess the isopropanol
one would buy in a pharmacy varies depending on who
makes it and the country (wikipedia says that in the
USA and the UK Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol is made
of ethanol, not isoproyl).
One paper looked at preservation of spiders, and foundRNAlater and propylene glycol worked well. Another
paper on aphids found acetone was good, as was diethyl
ether, and ethyl acetate. I’m not sure though how easy
these are to obtain, or safely these can be transported
though (RNAlater is too expensive to consider).
I also searched the archives, but suprisingly this doesn’t
seem to be a topic that has come up before.
Thanks Peter Unmack

HIV batch sequence queries
HIV evolution colleagues,
Many of us now require large numbers of HIV
sequences with associated clinical and geographic
annotations. The best place to get both se-
quence and annotations has long been the Los
Alamos database ( http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/-
sequence/HIV/mainpage.html ). Unfortunately, the
query interface is rather cumbersome to use, and re-
quires some basic understanding of database organiza-
tion that perhaps not everyone has time to acquire.
I have implemented an alternative interface to the
LANL HIV DB that allows the user to input a simple
query based on the syntax of the NCBI Entrez query
language (for example, “(C)[subtype] (gp120)[gene]
(ZA BW)[country]”) and retrieves annotated sequences
(4019, in this case) in FASTA format direct to your
browser window. You can ﬁnd this tool at http://-
fortinbras.us/hivq . The site is completely free, collects
no information from you, and uses no cookies.
If this is your bag, please give it a try, and send along
comments to the address indicated at the site.

maj@fortinbras.usMeasuring selection coeﬃcients
answers
Here are the responses to my recent enquiry about how
best to estimate the magnitude of selection coeﬃcients
from longitudinal data on allele frequency. My original
query is given below.
Firstly, many thanks to all who responded.
I make no comment on the individual responses but
would note that we intend to track the spread of in-
secticide resistance in large geographic regions; the
presumed intense selection and (unfortunate) large
mosquito population size makes me inclined to ignore
the eﬀects of drift.
*****************original ques-
tion*****************
I want to estimate selection coeﬃcients from a longitu-
dinal series of diploid genotype frequencies. The gene
in question encodes insecticide resistance so selection is
relatively intense.
I intend to use max. likelihood to ﬁt initial allele fre-
quency, selection coeﬃcient and dominance (i.e. P(0),
s and h in standard terminology). Given these three
parameters we can predict genotype frequencies at any
given time point and use the multinomial distribution
to get LL of obtaining the observed number of the three
genotypes.
So I have two questions
(1) Is this a sensible way of doing it, or are there hidden
pitfalls
and/or is there a better way?
(2) Has anyone done it before and published the method
so we can cite
it? It seems like it should be a standard type of analysis
but we
haven’t been able to track a previous one down yet.
(3) Better still, is there a public access programme that
we can
download? If not, we’ll write our own and make it
available.
Comment from myself (you always think of something
straight after you’ve sent the message)52 EvolDir January 1, 2009
Why check ﬁt to the three genotype frequencies? I’ll
track allele frequency so why not count the alleles in
the three genotypes at each time point and then use the
binomial to get LL from the predicted allele frequency.
This also avoids having to assume the genotypes are in
H-W which may be problematic if selection has already
taken place (because, by deﬁnition, selection will cause
deviations from HW)
A sensible procedure, but with one trap. Remember
to condition on your observations, that is, update the
initial allele frequency every time you make an obser-
vation, and evaluate s and h based on each interval of
observation.
A. G. Clark used this procedure around 1980 in publi-
cations in Genetics and Heredity, as far as I remember.

Dear Ian Hastings,
Regarding your question on Evoldir, could you possibly
post the most interesting answers?
I am working at IGC, Portugal in Evolutionary Ge-

populations for which I’ll need the same kind of esti-
mations.

Dear Ian,
I am currently working on a very similar issue, and I
would be glad to know if you got some feedback on your
question. I have a piece of code in R to estimate p(0)
and the relative ﬁtness of 3 possible genotypes using
maximum likelihood, and it seems to work (although it
is very experimental). The algorithm relies on the as-
sumption that the population size is inﬁnite (no drift),
so that all stochasticity comes from sampling. Account-
ing both for drift and sampling requires much more
complex stats, including random eﬀects etc., but it is
not impossible (in theory).In case you are comfortable with R, let me know if you
are interested in beta testing my code. Otherwise, I
am also curious about existing software that can do the
job.
Cheers,

Hi Ian,
John Novembre just made me aware of your post-
ing. You might want to take a look at: http://-

Ian – A major issue with which you will have to be
concerned is sample size. Several years ago, Joel King-

on estimates of selection.

Microstellite technical question
Dear EvolDir members,
I have a very technical question about microsatellites
motifs and how to read them correclty when sequenced.
I explain: If I have a motif (AG)12 it is a dinucleotide
so diﬀerent alleles are at least two base pairs apart (say
genotype 120 - 122)
If I have a motif (AGT)12 it is a triucleotide so diﬀerent
alleles are at least three base pairs apart (say genotype
120 - 123)
(AAGA) is a tetranucleotide ...
however, when motifs are of this kind:(GT)15(AT)3(GT)20 Is it still a dinocleotide?
(CT)12TTCT(GT)18(GA)10 ant this?
(TC)3(TCTG)5 ??
Thanks for your help, it will be very much appreciated

Ne-Nb query
Dear EvolDir,
I am seeking clariﬁcation regarding the correct calcula-
tion and interpretation of eﬀective population size (Ne)
versus eﬀective number of breeders (Nb) within a closed
aquaculture population, and I would be very grateful if
anyone is able to assist me with this query.
In a closed population from a single spawning, if calcu-
lating Ne from actual data (msat parentage data) using:
Ne = 4.Nef.Nem/(Nef + Nem); where Nef = (Nf.Kf-
1)/(Kf-1 + Vkf/Kf), Nem = (Nf.Kf-1)/(Kf-1 +
Vkf/Kf), Nf = Number of female broodstock, Kf =
mean number of progeny per female breeder, Vkf =
variance in progeny number per female, and similarly
for male breeders for Nm, Km & Vkm (Lande & Bar-
rowclough, 1987),
when is it necessary to standardise Km & Kf to 2, as per
Hedrick et al. 1995 Conservation Biology 9:615-624? Is
this only done to avoid potential biases of overestimat-
ing progeny variance when dealing with large, simu-
lated datasets (as in this paper)? This paper assumes
Km=Kf, but how is standardisation implemented when
Km doesn’t = Kf (e.g when uneven broodstock sex ra-
tios are used)? In the literature I have not yet been able
to ﬁnd any such examples of standardisation to 2 when
dealing with actual datasets (i.e. not simulations), but
if anyone can point me towards some examples it would
be great.
Additionally, can anyone conﬁrm, refute or clarify for
me that in a closed population containing only one gen-
eration (e.g. an aquaculture population), the interpre-
tation of Ne is the same as Nb? My understanding
is that it is important to distinguish Nb from Ne in
natural populations with overlapping generations, but
in this instance when considering a single generation
closed aquaculture population, is it incorrect to treat54 EvolDir January 1, 2009
the Nb of this population as Ne (or vice versa for that
matter)?
If anybody is able to shed some light on these queries
for me I would be extremely appreciative and grateful.
Thanks for your time.

Nuclear and mitochondrial
phylogeny answers
Dear Evoldir members, A few days ago I sent some
questions regarding my technical problem on doing phy-
logenies with both mitochondrial and nuclear markers.
I am posting all the answers that I received, since some
people are facing the some problem. Thanks so much
to all that dedicated some time to answer me!
Obs: For now, I am using the MrBayes approach of
partitioning datasets and it is apparently working.

Dear Evoldir members,
I am working with mitochondrial and nuclear sequences
(cytochrome b and the intron b-ﬁbrinogen 5) to try to
delineate population structure and I am trying to do
a phylogenetic tree with these two markers. But I am
experiencing some problems with how to make an in-
put for some programs (I am currently working with
MrBayes and PHYML). For each individual, I have se-
quences of both nuclear and mitochondrial markers.
Should I analyze these two markers as two datasets?
How can I do it?
Should I concatenate them and consider as a single se-
quence and run a modeltest to determinate the best
substitution model?
In a recent paper, Cabanne et al. (2008) concatenated
the nuclear and mitochondrial sequences, and used the
IUPAC ambiguity code for the polymorphic sites. Since
I know the phase of my nuclear sequences, is there a way
that I can use it in the phylogeny with the mitochon-
drial data?
Any comments would be of great help.

Dear Sibelle
You should analyse your data separately. The markers
are not linked, thus will no be co-inherited. The true
tree for these markers would be highly reticulated. You
will also need to account for the fact that there are 2
alleles for the nuclear gene. if you have heterozygous in-
dividuals, then PHASE is a very good software to deal
with this. Cheers Brent
Sibelle, Both the programs you mention allow you to
partition a single data set and use diﬀerent pareme-
ters for each partition in a combined analysis. That
seems a good way for you to proceed here. Check
the respective manuals for details, but it’s not diﬃ-
cult. You can also analyze them together under a sin-
gle model. Using a gamma distribution of site rates
can cover much of the diﬀerence among partitions,
and the results would not be useless. And this would
allow you to use some fast likelihood programs like
RAxML and GARLI. In MrBayes, at least, you can’t
run partitioned analyses using diﬀerent basic models;
only the parameters can vary among partitions. But
all other models are special cases of GTR + I + G,
so MrBayes will approximate whatever model is ap-
propriate for each partition. Here, for comparison, is
a Mr.Bayes block that does partitioned analysis of a
mitochondrial data set, by codon position. begin mr-
bayes; lset nst=6 rates=invgamma; charset 1position =
1-10858 \3; charset 2position = 2-10859 \3; charset 3po-
sition = 3-10860 \3 partition by position 3:1position,
2position, 3position; set partition = by position; unlink
shape=(all); unlink revmat=(all); unlink pinvar=(all);
unlink statefreq=(all); showmodel; mcmcp ngen00000
samplefreqP0 printfreq00 savebrlens=yes nchains=4;
quit; end;
Regards, John H.
Hi,
If the two genes independently show diﬀerent models
to use from model testing, it would be inappropriate to
concatenate them as a single sequence. Good luck with
your analysis.
David Liberles University of Wyoming
It depends on your data, but it’s likely that you’ll
want to partition each gene by codon position and
run a separate model on each. Below is an exam-
ple from a dataset I have, with three genes (28S,
EF1a, and wingless). It’s possible, however, that mak-
ing this many partitions will create problems with
too many parameters. There’s a program called
Tracer (tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) that willhelp check if there are problems (based on MrBayes
output). One nice thing about it is that you can do the
run with it fully partitioned and look at how the pa-
rameters converged in the diﬀerent partitions, so if they
are similar (for example, if ﬁrst and second positions
are both extremely slow-evolving) you might want to
combine them in order to reduce the parameters. The
paper by Praz et al. 2008 (Mol. Phyl. Evol. 49(1):185-
197) gives a good explanation of using it. Here’s how
partitioning is done for a MrBayes block: BEGIN mr-
bayes; charset 28S=1-1599 1600; charset EF101-2176
2428-2703 3017-3268; charset EF1nt101-2174 \3 2428-

Software FigTreev1 2released
FigTree v1.2 is now available for download from its web-56 EvolDir January 1, 2009
site:
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree/ What is
FigTree?
FigTree is designed as a graphical viewer of phyloge-
netic trees and as a program for producing publication-
ready ﬁgures. It was written as a companion program
to BEAST <http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/ >but it can
be used to generate trees from other programs as well.
Mac OS X, Linux/UNIX and Windows versions are
available
FigTree requires a Java Virtual Machine to run. Many
systems will already have this installed. It requires at
least version 1.5 of Java to run (see README ﬁle for
details). Mac OS X version 10.4 or better (Tiger and
Leopard) will already have a suitable version of Java
installed. I am sorry but FigTree simply doesn’t run
on older versions of Mac OS X.
Features Cross-platform graphical tree display. Three
diﬀerent tree styles: rectangular, polar and radial. Dis-
play of node heights, branch lengths, support values
and other annotations. Node height range bars if avail-
able. Collapse of clades into triangles. Colouring of
branches and tip labels. Colouring by annotation (for
example, support values). Quick search for tip labels
or partial tip labels. Printing and export as PDF and
other graphics formats.
What is new in version 1.2?
Added a ’highlight’ button which provides a block
colouring for a clade.
Added a continous colour gradient option to the ’Colour
By’ control in the Appearance panel. Use setup to ac-
tivate (at present it disables the ’Width By’ option.
Added a ’Name’ annotation that can be used to edit
taxon names. It can also be used to name clades (and
these are displayed for collapsed clades).
Added a new drop down ﬁnd panel that is activate by
Find in the Edit menu or the ﬁnd icon in the tool bar.
Font sizes and a few other options can now be set in
the ’Preferences’ box. These act as defaults for new
windows.
Can be run in command line mode to convert tree ﬁles
into graphics formats (useful for workﬂows and web-
server applications).
Bug Fixes: Fixed a problem with branch annotations
being applied to the wrong branches when the tree is
re-rooted.
“Colour By” colours were reversed from those suggested
in the Setup dialog.The “Colour By” setup didn’t work as expected if Auto-
Range was turned oﬀ.
Made the control palette panels slightly more compact.

Postdoctoral Position:
We seek a postdoctoral associate to oversee and coor-
dinate all aspects of geospatial analysis relating to the
investigation of speciation patterns and distribution of
vertebrate species in Madagascar. The research is part
of an NSF-funded project in collaboration with the
Field Museum of Natural History and the University
of Antananarivo, Madagascar. Phylogenetic and bio-
geographic analysis of Malagasy vertebrates, each with
unique life-history and dispersal characteristics, are be-
ing conducted to identify areas of high endemism po-
tentially associated with underlying geological features,
and also to test for the role that rivers have played in
generating patterns of vertebrate diversity and distri-
bution. The postdoctoral associate will focus on Ge-
ographical Information System (GIS) analyses which
will serve as the integrative platform for synthesizing
specimen occurrence data with phylogenetic analyses.
The Yoder Lab is located in Duke’s Biological Sciences
Building where we are a member of the highly dynamic
and interactive Department of Biology. All lab projects
aim to investigate the geological and geographic forces
that drive patterns of vertebrate distribution and en-
demism in Madagascar. Madagascar has been desig-
nated as one of the most critical geographic priorities
for conservation action, retaining less than 10% of the
natural habitats that existed before human coloniza-
tion. Field inventory activities focus on the herpeto-
fauna and mammals occurring at the survey sites. The
lab also has a signiﬁcant focus on capacity-building
through the education and training of both American
and Malagasy students.
Qualiﬁcations:
The successful applicant will have completed their
Ph.D. and is expected to have expertise in ecological
niche modeling (ENM), using some or all of the fol-
lowing GIS tools: OpenModeller, BIOCLIM, GARP,
MODIS, Maxent, etc. The successful candidate will be
highly organized, mature, enthusiastic, and motivated.
Conditions:
This position is funded for two years. Salary is com-
petitive, and the position will carry full beneﬁts. The
position will be given to the most qualiﬁed applicant,
though a start date of February 1, 2009 or sooner isJanuary 1, 2009 EvolDir 61

DukeU PopulationGenomics
The Noor laboratory at Duke University seeks post-
doctoral applicants to help with one or both of two
projects. The ﬁrst project is a collaborative, NIH-
funded research project to help examine the nature
of the association of ﬁne-scale recombination rate and
nucleotide diversity, divergence, and codon bias in
a Drosophila species. Related papers listed below.
Eﬀorts will include computational analyses of multi-
ple new full-genome-resequences and ﬁne-scale linkage
maps as well as some molecular lab benchwork. This
funding is collaborative with Rich Kliman and Laurence
Loewe. Basic computational skills required, preferably
speciﬁcally on analyses of DNA sequences.
The second project is to examine patterns of sex chro-
mosome evolution and sexual selection in an unrelated
species for which a new genome sequence assembly is
being obtained. This species has homomorphic sex
chromosomes, and the sex-determining region is associ-
ated with an active mobile element. Again, basic com-
putational biology skills and basic molecular lab skills
required.
If interested in one or both projects, please contact
Mohamed Noor (noor@duke.edu). DO NOT send
attachments- just send statement of intent and expe-
rience in text of e-mail. Anticipated timing is spring/
summer of 2009, but this is potentially negotiable.

EmoryU 2 DrosophilaSpeciation
Two Post-Doc Positions in Speciation Gene and Mei-
otic Drive in Drosophila in Emory University
Two post-doc positions funded by NIH (pending ﬁnal
approval) are available at April 1, 2009 in the lab of
Yun Tao at Emory University on mapping, cloning and
molecularly charactering genes involved in meiotic drive
and speciation in Drosophila simulans. The start date
is ﬂexible from January to middle summer, 2009. The
initial appointment will be one year but extendable up
to four years. The goals of the project are (1) to charac-
terize two meiotic drive systems (Winters and Durham)
in D. simulans; (2) to characterize the speciation genes
between D. simulans and D. mauritiana; (3) to trace
the molecular evolution of the genes involved in mei-
otic drive and speciation; and (4) ﬁnally to test the
theory that meiotic drive is a major mechanism leading
to speciation.
Some background of the project can be found in the
three publications (Tao et al. 2001 PNAS 98: 13183-8;
Tao et al. 2007a PLoS Biology 5 (11): e292; Tao et al.
2007b PLoS Biology 5(11); e293. )
Candidates for these two positions should have demon-
strated expertise in one or more of the following ar-
eas: Drosophila genetics, standard molecular biology
lab techniques, small RNA, bioinformatics, molecular
evolution, evolutionary genetics (experimental or the-
ory). Candidates are expected to be highly motivated
(i.e., pursuing an academic career), independent, eager
to learn new skills and explore new intellectual terri-
tories. Successful applicants are encouraged to develop
new and independent research projects in the broad
ﬁeld of evolutionary genetics, particularly in genetic
conﬂicts and speciation.
Interested applicants should contact Yun Tao
(ytao3@emory.edu; 404-727-0815) with a cover
letter, CV, a one-page statement of career development
(i.e., research interests), and the names of three or
more references.

The Long-term goal of our research is to elucidate 1)
the molecular basis of spectral tuning of visual pig-
ments and 2) the evolutionary mechanisms of dim-light
and color vision of organisms to various light environ-
ments. To solve these central unanswered questions in
phototransduction and evolutionary genetics simulta-
neously, we perform gene cloning and mutagenesis anal-
yses, cell culture-based functional assays, evolutionary
genetic and synthetic biological analyses, and quantum
chemical analyses for various vertebrate species.

UBasel BehaviouralEvolution
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN BEHAVIOURAL
EVOLUTION ? We are looking for a postdoctoral sci-
entist interested in behavioral/social evolution. The
research of our group focuses on the evolution of fam-
ily interactions by family conﬂicts and parent-oﬀspring
co-adaptation, and we explore experimentally the func-
tions and inheritance of interacting parent and oﬀspring
behavioral phenotypes. The research is carried out
using a (sub-)social insect species, the European ear-
wig Forﬁcula auricularia (Dermaptera). Earwig females
provide food to their early instar nymphs and protect
them against predation. Their oﬀspring interact with
their mothers to inﬂuence food provisioning, and they
compete among each other. Our previous work showed
that insect progeny solicit from their caring parents
by chemical signalling (pheromones), and part of theJanuary 1, 2009 EvolDir 71
project involves analyses and quantiﬁcation of oﬀspring
chemical signals using GC/MS.
BACKGROUND ? Applicants should have a PhD
and a strong background and interest in behav-
ioral ecology and/or evolutionary quantitative ge-
netics. Experience with behavioral experimenta-
tion/observation/quantiﬁcation is required. Experience
with GC/MS for analyses of chemical cues is not a re-
quirement, but a plus.
RESEARCH GROUP AND INSTITUTE ? Our re-
search group is part of the Zoological Institute at the
University of Basel, which hosts various groups that in-
teract on a daily basis, share a common interest in evo-
lutionary questions and work on diverse research topics
and study systems including host-parasite interactions
(Prof. Ebert), speciation (Prof. Salzburger), immune
system evolution (Prof. Du Pasquier), sex-allocation
(Dr. Scharer), and sexual selection and bird song (Dr.

ButterﬂyEvolution
Job oﬀer for a postdoc at the Universite catholique de
Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium:
“Behavioural ecology of butterﬂy movements: a matter
of perception?”
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who could
join us for a period of 12 months starting in Jan-Mar
2009 (exact starting date is negotiable). We aim to
develop new and stimulating behavioural research on
the signiﬁcance of perceptual range within a context of
insect dispersal in fragmented landscapes. Butterﬂies
are used as model system for a series of experiments
in the lab and in the ﬁeld. Earlier work on speck-
led woods (Pararge aegeria L.) has suggested intrigu-
ing diﬀerences in the response distance to target habi-
tat in individuals from continuous forest and individu-
als from fragmented agricultural landscape (Merckx &
Van Dyck 2007. Anim. Behav. 74: 1029-1037). We
want to better understand the nature of environmen-
tal cues butterﬂies respond to during traveling across
the landscape matrix. Therefore we want to develop
a challenging evolutionary ecological research program
with a strong emphasis on perceptual diﬀerences rela-
tive to landscape type. We will also explore some eco-
physiological aspects. Another postdoc will also join
our team to work in this ﬁeld, so it will be a collabo-
rative project. There will be frequent interactions with
the lab-members of other lines of research. You will
earn a postdoc grant from our University (UCL).
Candidates should have excellent CV (i.e., several pub-
lications in outstanding behavioural, ecological, conser-
vation or evolutionary journals, experience with obser-
vational and experimental behavioural research). Only
researchers who have been outside Belgium for at least
the last two years can apply for this position.
You will work within a cluster of two young research
teams at the Biodiversity Research Centre of the Uni-
versit´ e catholique de Louvain (UCL) in Belgium. The
Behavioural Ecology and Conservation Group headed
by Hans Van Dyck ( www.ecol.ucl.ac.be/ecco/en ) and
the Quantitative Conservation Biology Group headed
by Nicolas Schtickzelle ( www.uclouvain.be/quant-cons-
biol). Van Dyck’s lab addresses several issues within
the broad ﬁeld of evolution in anthropogenic landscapesJanuary 1, 2009 EvolDir 73
(combining behavioural ecology, life history biology,
thermal ecology, landscape ecology and conservation).
Schtickzelle’s lab addresses conservation issues using
quantitative approaches like population viability anal-
ysis. Both labs have a common and complementary in-
terest in the process of dispersal and in resource-based
habitat approaches. Our university is in the French-
speaking part of Belgium (Louvain-la-Neuve, close to
Brussels). Lab meetings and other scientiﬁc meetings
are in English, some knowledge of French would be easy.
If you are interested, please send an e-mail message in
which you explain why you would like to join us and
attach your CV (including a full publication list and a
reference person) as a separate document.
Please submit your ﬁle no later than December, 25th

Speciation genetics
A postdoc position is available to study the geneticsof speciation using a natural hybrid zone of pied and
collared ﬂycatchers on the Swedish islands of Oland

more than 10.000 individual birds (collected during the
last 30 years) and a large number of genetic markers
available. This opens the possibility of genetic ap-
proaches ranging from traditional quantitative genetics
to genome-wide association studies. The aim is to an-
swer central questions on the process of speciation from
a genomic perspective. For example, are the genes cod-
ing for ecological and sexual isolation the same genes
that are causing genetic incompatibility? The project
would be suitable for someone with a strong interest
in evolutionary biology in general and in speciation or
genetic related questions in particular. Previous expe-
rience in quantitative genetics, QTL-mapping or bioin-
formatics would be advantageous. Candidates should
be able to work independently and have good organi-
zational skills.

Speciation genomics
Massive parallel sequencing provides outstanding possi-
bilities for detecting the genetic basis of adaptation, in-
cluding those genome characteristics that underlie spe-
ciation. Besides oﬀering a route toward the identiﬁ-
cation of speciation genes or genomic island of specia-
tion, the new technologies can be used to address the
relative importance of structural versus regulatory dif-
ferences in adaptive population divergence. The two
songbird sister species pied and collared collared ﬂy-
catcher are important ecological models for studies of
speciation and life history evolution. We are seeking an
ambitious bioinformatics post-doc who, using a combi-
nation of data from high-throughput short (Illumina
Solexa) and medium (Roche 454) next generation se-
quencing approaches, will analyse transcriptome as well
as full genome sequences from these species, with the
ultimate aim of identifying regions involved in their re-
productive isolation. The successful candidate needs
to have a background in molecular evolution and be
well acquainted with the handling of large-scale DNA
sequence data.

Vienna PopulationGenetics
A postdoctoral position is available, for research into
the genetics of speciation in Antirrhinum. The project
would focus on a hybrid zone between subspecies that
diﬀer in ﬂoral morphology: plants would be genotyped
for major genes that determine ﬂower pattern, and for
multiple microsatellite markers. The aim is to ﬁnd
why the subspecies remain distinct, and how they di-
verged from eachother. This is a joint project between
Nick Barton at the Institute of Science and Technology
(I.S.T. Austria), and Enrico Coen, at the John Innes
Institute in Norwich. The postdoc would be based at
I.S.T., and would be responsible for experimental de-
sign and data analysis; she/he would take part in ﬁeld-
work in the Pyrenees.
The Institute of Science and Technology is a new
multidisciplinary research insttitute, located in theWienerwald, just outside Vienna ( http://www.ist-
austria.ac.at ); the working language is English. There
are close links with other population genetics groups at
the University of Vienna and at the Veterinary Univer-
sity.
The position will be available for three years, with the
possibility of an extension; the salary scale starts at
44,100 p.a. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in a rele-
vant area, with good quantitative and computing skills,
and an interest in evolutionary biology. For further de-
tails, please contact nick.barton@ist-austria.ac.at. Ap-
plications should be sent by January 15th, and should
include a CV, a statement of research interests, and
names of referees. I.S.T. Austria encourages women to
apply, and child-care facilities are available.

EvolutionaryModeling
We are looking for two postdoctoral scientists inter-
ested in developing mathematical models of ecological
and evolutionary processes in communities. Although
the speciﬁc questions to be addressed are open, the ba-
sic aim is to derive systems of diﬀerential or diﬀerence
equations from a description of interactions among phe-
notypically variable individuals for a variety of ecolog-
ical interactions (such as competition, predation, and
mutualism) to model the joint population and evolu-
tionary dynamics of communities. The work is part
of an ongoing collaboration between Scott Nuismer,
Richard Gomulkiewicz, and Michael Doebeli to develop
a theoretical framework for coevolution between multi-
ple species.
One position will be based in the joint research group
of Richard Gomulkiewicz (Washington State Univer-
sity; Pullman) and Scott Nuismer (University of Idaho;
Moscow), and the other will be based in the re-
search group of Michael Doebeli (University of British
Columbia; Vancouver). Applicants should have a PhD,
a background in evolutionary biology or ecology, and
an interest in developing and analyzing mathematical
models of biological processes. For more information
please contact Scott Nuismer, Richard Gomulkiewicz
or Michael Doebeli.

UC Davis WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGE-
NETICS at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay,
California
March 7-13, 2009
Sponsored by the
University of California, Davis and Bodega Marine Lab-
oratory (additional ﬁnancial support provided by the
University of Rochester, and NESCent)
Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
playing an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecological communities. The construction
of phylogenetic trees is becoming a methodology that is
well-deﬁned, with broad agreement on the central issues
and questions. A nearly standard set of topics is now
taught as part of the curriculum at many colleges and
universities. On the other hand, application of phylo-
genetic methods to interesting problems outside of sys-
tematics is an area of special excitement, innovation,
and controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
In March, 2009, for the tenth year, we will teach a work-
shop for graduate students interested in applying phy-logenetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The one-
week course will be an intensive exploration of problems
to which modern phylogenetic tools are being applied.
We cover a range of topics in biogeography, ecology,
conservation biology, phylogenomics, functional mor-
phology, macroevolution, speciation, and character evo-
lution. The course starts with recent advances in phylo-
genetic methodology, and then focuses on methods and
tools that can be brought to bear on these “applied”
issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held entirely at the Bodega Marine
Lab on the Northern California coast, which has ex-
tensive computing resources and on-site housing. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, discus-
sion, and training in software and internet tools. One
afternoon during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips
to local natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Finding, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees; phylogenetic databases * Recent advances in
tree reconstruction: Bayesian inference; stochastic
optimization strategies; divide-and-conquer methods;
Garli; gene-tree species tree resolution * Analysis of
character evolution–theory: parsimony, likelihood and
Bayesian approaches; null models and statistical test-
ing * Analysis of character evolution–form and func-
tion of complex character systems * Phylogeography;
coalescent methods for inferring migration rates and
patterns * Phylogenetic comparative methods * Phy-
logenetic perspectives on biodiversity and conservation
biology * Data mining of sequence databases for phylo-January 1, 2009 EvolDir 81

sequence data, analysis of diversiﬁcation rates * Eco-
logical Phylogenetics, biogeography
Instructors for the main workshop.
* Peter Wainwright * Brad Shaﬀer * Brian Moore *
Michael Donoghue * Bruce Rannala * Jonathan Eisen
* Rich Glor * Justen Whittall * Greg Pauly * Samantha
Price * Stephen Smith * Phil Spinks * Robert Thomson
plus guest lecturers!!
Prerequisites. Students should have some familiarity
with phylogenetic methods through previous course-
work. Some experience with PAUP, PHYLIP, or other
programs for phylogeny reconstruction will be assumed.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $450. This includes

USalzburg Phylogeography Feb12-20
Phylogeographical Analysis - Workshop and
PhD/Master course (course Nr.: 437.112)
Phylogeography literally combines phylogeny with bio-
geography and investigates the geographic distribution
of intra- or interspeciﬁc genetic variation. Observed
patterns reﬂect the biogeographical and evolutionary
history of a species or a species complex. Phylogeo-
graphic studies address questions about colonization
pattern, historical range contractions or expansions in
reaction to past climate change or other environmen-
tal inﬂuences, ice age refugia or hybridization. The
phylogeographic approach has become increasingly im-
portant in taxonomic research as well as in the ﬁeld
of conservation biology. Methodologically, phylogeog-
raphy combines elements of population genetics, phy-
logeny and historical biogeography. Despite its original
focus on genetic lineages and sequence data, also al-
lele frequencies and other types of genetic data are fre-
quently used. In this course we will introduce the the-
oretical basis of phylogeography, genetic markers used,
and data analysis. The main part will be a computer
course in analysing and interpreting phylogeographic
data based on model datasets and/or data sets of stu-
dents.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),84 EvolDir January 1, 2009
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
