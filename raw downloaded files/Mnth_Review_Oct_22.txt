\The key to every biological problem must nally be
sought in the cell, for every living organism is, or at
some time has been, a cell." - E.B. Wilson
You are cordially invited to register for our 2022 Annual
Symposium on Mechanisms of Cellular Evolution, held
on November 4-5, 2022 at the BII Center for Mecha-
nisms of Evolution at Arizona State University in Tempe,
AZ. This event will serve as the inauguration of an an-
nual series of symposia focused on various topics in the
eld of evolutionary cell biology (ECB). This emerging,
interdisciplinary eld of ECB encompasses the elds
of both evolutionary biology and cell biology in col-
laboration with biochemistry, biophysics, population
genetics, molecular biology, mathematics, and other
similar elds. The motivation behind this meeting is
the simple point that the cell and its contents dene
the natural setting within which genes, genomes, pro-
teins, and other molecular features evolve. It follows
that a stronger focus on the molecular features inside
of cells and the constraints under which they function
will lead to an improved understanding of evolutionary
processes. Remarkably, despite well-established elds of
molecular evolution, genome evolution, and evolution-
ary developmental biology, we still have no recognizable
eld of ECB. Our eorts with this symposium seek to
change that. Through these eorts, we aim to facilitate
a diverse, interdisciplinary, and collaborative networkof scholars that seek to understand the evolutionary
mechanisms underlying cellular evolution. This year,
our focus will be on subcellular protein localization and
function in diverse eukaryotes, and we are thus solicit-
ing for abstracts for poster presentations and selected
talks related to these general theme. Attendees of our
in-person symposium will have a chance to engage with
our three keynote speakers, Ross Waller of the Uni-
versity of Cambridge, Lena Pernas of the Max Planck
Institute for Biology and Ageing, and Aaron Turkewitz
of the University of Chicago, develop connections with
other scientists in our poster session, and collaborate
on addressing some of the most pressing issues in ECB
in our roundtable session. We will also be having an
option to engage in the symposium in a hybrid format
to allow for engagement with the invited talks.
Registrations and poster abstracts are due Septem-
ber 30, 2022 @11:59pm Arizona time. Thanks for
your consideration, and we look forward to review-
ing your abstracts. Questions about the symposium
can be sent to the Program Manager, Josh Hoskin-
son, at josh.hoskinson@asu.edu. Sincerely, The BII

| CALL FOR ABSTRACTS NOW OPEN |
The 2022 edition of TiBE - Trends in Biodiversity
and Evolution will be devoted to THE BIOLOGY OF
COLOUR. Colour is a central aspect of the biology of
many living beings, contributing to mediate their rela-
tionship with members of their own species and their
ecosystem. During three days, we will discuss recent
trends in the study of the evolutionary and functional
signicance of colour in nature integrating knowledge
from biologists working on multiple aspects of coloura-
tion. Held in an informal but stimulating scientic at-
mosphere, these conferences provide an excellent oppor-
tunity for strong interaction and brainstorming between
students and more experienced researcher
| PROGRAM |
The conference will be structured in four sessions, cov-
ering dierent topics. Each session will open with a
plenary conference by a leading researcher in the topic,
and will be followed by oral communications. A poster
session will take place at the end of the rst day of talks.
Session 1 - Genetics and Evolution of Colour Plenary
talk: Marie Manceau (Coll >1

Cogne Italy Rupicapra Sep27-30
Dear Rupi-people,
We hope this email nds you all well and safe! The
8th World Congress on Mountain Ungulates (https:/-
/8wcmu.grand-paradis.it/) is approaching fast, and as
you may see from the program embedded below, on
WED 28th, between 18:30 and 19:30h, we have reserved
a slot for a Rupicapra Group meeting. We believe this
will be a good opportunity, for those of us who are
attending the Congress, to meet in person and discuss
some of the hot-topics that emerged during our last meet-
ing online, including -but not limited to- international
research/monitoring collaborations, the possibility to
give the group a clearer structure (see, e.g., the Ibex
European Group), and the participation to initiatives
such as Euromammals. We look forward to meeting in
person in Cogne in a few weeks!

overview
Host-microbe interactions can be positive or negative
for both a host organism and its symbiotic microbes.
Interacting with microbes can allow eukaryotes to ac-
quire crucial functions, like nutrient production, but
interactions can also be pathogenic in nature. This
cross-disciplinary meeting will bring together scientists
using cellular, molecular, ecological, physiological, and
theory-based approaches to explore the evolution of
intimate species-species interactions. Our aim is to un-
derstand the cellular systems and pathways that drive
transitions in symbiotic states, for example, as partner-
ships move from pathogenesis to benecial and back
again.

Dear colleagues,
A reminder that the next instalment of the online semi-
nar series organised by the ESEB-funded STN network
Integration Of Speciation research ( [ https://-
speciation-network.pages.ist.ac.at/ ] ) will be held on
11th October 2022, 9 am CET.
The upcoming session addresses the topic of \Genomic
approaches to identifying barrier loci". We welcome as
speakers Christelle Fraisse (University of Lille, France)
and Stuart Baird (Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech
Republic).
The session will last 1.5 hours, with the rst hour dedi-
cated to talks from our speakers followed by questions.
The last half-an-hour is dedicated to a more general
discussion.
To attend the session live, please follow the link on our

seminar-series/ . Talks (but not the discus-
sion session) are recorded and made avail-
able here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/-
UClEkDdE 5sDw70SQq78DIAA . The IOS network
aims to promote scientic integration and also inte-
gration of the community. A main objective on this
front is to foster diversity and inclusion across the eld.
The seminar series and subsequent discussion is open
to everyone, from students to established researchers
and non-scientists alike. In order to maximise the
geographic diversity of attendees, we will alternate
between two time slots every other month: 5 pm CET
and 9 am CET. Please help us to circulate this email
to anyone who may be interested, especially those
in countries that are typically underrepresented in
scientic discourse.
The programme of the seminar series is announced by
email, on Twitter (@Speciation net) and on the IOS
network website. People who wish to automatically
receive the programme and other news from the IOS
network can sign up to the network mailing list from

Nov17-18
Dear colleagues,
We are Animal behaviour Live, an international online
platform promoting sustainable and inclusive events
fully broadcasted online on YouTube. We aim to bring
together researchers in animal behaviour from all over
the world to discuss the latest research and question
our academic practices. We are glad to announce that
this year we are hosting the third edition of the Animal
Behaviour Live: Annual Online Congress on the 17th
and 18th of November 2022.
In line with our ethos, the event is free of charge to
all researchers from the community, and we strive to
ensure representation from all across the globe and in
line with our communities' composition. To ensure that
everyone can participate, we organise multiple sessions
per day for a holistic coverage of all time zones. In
addition, every presentation is available to replay on our
YouTube channel for at least two weeks past the congress.
You can nd more information about our conference on
our website (https://animalbehaviour.live/aoc.html), or
by watching some of our past videos on the YouTube
channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAcb-
k186yZmalqNJ9JTJw).
Our organisation is small (we are 7 early career re-
searchers working on a voluntary basis) and the success
of this event is based on the support of our community.
For this reason, we would be particularly grateful if
you could spread the word about this event to your
community. To do so, you can nd attached a yer of
the event. In addition, if you have a twitter account,
you can also follow us (@AnimalBehavLive) and RT our
announcement about the congress.

24thYOUNGSYSTEMATISTS'FORUM
Friday 11thNovember 2022, 9:30 am GMT
ZOOM Online
The annualYoung Systematists'Forumrepresents an ex-
citing setting for Master's students, PhD students and
young postdoctoral researchers to present their work, of-
ten for the rst time, to a scientic audience interested
in taxonomy and systematics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors andother established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promisingtalkand-
ashpresentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration isFREE.
https://systass.org/events/future-events/ysf2022/
When you register you will be asked to supply your
name, contact information and tell us whether you wish
to give a full talk or ash presentation.Please also tell
us your academic stage - e.g., Masters, PhD or postdoc
and aliation. Abstract submission and registration
are separate portals, both on the YSF event page.
Spaces will be allocated subject to availability and for a
balanced programme of animal, plant, algal, microbial,
molecular and other research. Non-presenting attendees
are also very welcome - please register as above.
Abstractsmust be submitted by e-mail in English
and in Word format no later thanFriday 14 October
2022. The body text should not exceed 150 words
in length. Title, authors, and their professional af-
liations/addresses should be included with the ab-
stracts.If the presentation is co-authored, the actual
speakermust be clearly indicated inBOLDtext. The le
should be in editable format (.doc or .odt, not pdf) and
titled Surname First-name YSF2022.doc, for example
Doe Jane YSF2022.doc.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we ask
that you submit only for a ash presentation, as speaker
slots are limited and we want to give as many people
a chance as possible. If you are a more senior postdoc,
please be aware that it's unlikely we will be able to give
you a chance to present here, as the aim is to give more
junior researchers their rst experience in a supportive
international setting.
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website

ticity allows organisms short-term adaptation to envi-
ronmental changes. Antipredator plasticity, the abil-
ity of individuals to plastically respond to the pres-
ence of predators with inducible defenses, is one of the
best-studied instances of phenotypic plasticity. The
freshwater gastropod Physella acuta, a simultaneous
hermaphrodite, is a well-established model system for
antipredator plasticity. While there are numerous dif-
ferent chemical predator-related cues that can induce
defenses in this species, little is known about their prop-
erties and their chemical identity. The aim is to study
behavioral and morphological responses of individuals
to dierent predator-related chemical cues and to use14 EvolDir October 1, 2022
chromatographic methods so as to reveal the identity
of the chemical compounds that induce antipredator
plasticity in this model system.

BielefeldU FurSealGenomics
3-year PhD position: Genomic analysis of host-microbe
interactions in Antarctic fur seals
With Prof Joe Homan (Bielefeld University, Germany),
Prof Michael Schloter (Technische Universit at M unchen,
Germany), Dr Jaume Forcada (British Antarctic Survey,
UK) and Dr G abor ~A. Czirj ak (IZW, Germany).
An outstanding opportunity is available for a PhD
student to work on the genomic analysis of host-
microbe interactions in Antarctic fur seals. The po-
sition is available in Joe Homan's research group
(www.thehomanlab.com) at the Department of An-
imal Behaviour at Bielefeld University. The project will
be co-supervised by Michael Schloter (www.helmholtz-
muenchen.de/comi) and carried out in collaboration
with Jaume Forcada (https://www.bas.ac.uk/prole/-
jfor) and G abor Czirj ak (https://www.izw-berlin.de/-
de/gabor-czirjak-de.html). The PhD studentship is fully
funded for three years.
The project. Vertebrates are inhabited by vast numbers
of microorganisms that are increasingly emerging as key
players in their host's biology and evolution. These
microbial communities carry orders of magnitude more
genes than their hosts and support functions that are
not encoded in the host's genome. Consequently, the
microbiome is of fundamental importance to host func-
tion. This PhD project will combine an outstanding
natural system, Antarctic fur seals, with state-of-the-
art multi-omics approaches to investigate the structure16 EvolDir October 1, 2022
and function of the vertebrate gut microbiota and its
eects on host tness in a changing environment. It will
use an exceptionally rich and multifaceted dataset to
investigate how intrinsic and extrinsic factors inuence
the structure and function of host-associated microbial
communities. From there, it will elucidate the tness
consequences of gut microbes by linking microbial com-
munity structure and function to tness components
such as growth, survival and maturation of the immune
system. This project will provide multi-layered insights
into the importance of host-microbe interactions in a
wild vertebrate population that is declining in response
to climate change.
Applicant's prole. We seek a bright and highly mo-
tivated student who holds a good rst degree and an
M.Sc. or equivalent in a relevant topic (e.g. microbial
ecology, molecular ecology, bioinformatics). The ideal
candidate will have some experience of working in a ge-
netics lab as well as strong quantitative skills, including
prociency in working in R and writing custom scripts.
Practical experience of working with next generation
sequence data would be advantageous, but full training
will be provided. The candidate should also be able to
work both independently and as part of a team. A high
standard of spoken and written English is required.
The working environment. The rst 6-9 months of
the PhD will be spent learning and implementing lab-
oratory and data analysis workows in microbiome
analysis in Michael Schloter's group at the Technis-
che Universit at M unchen, Germany (www.helmholtz-
muenchen.de/comi). The group is one of the leading
institutions for microbiome analysis in Germany and
has been involved in the development of various national
and international SOPs in the eld. The group is well
equipped with high throughput sequencing instruments
for long- and short read, sequencing. Subsequent bioin-
formatics are done on a 100 knot server, which enables
the analysis of metabarcoding as well as metagenomics
data. The pre-alpine landscape around Munich makes
this area as one of the most attractive ones in Germany.
Afterwards, the PhD student will be based at the Depart-
ment of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University, Ger-
many (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/vhf/index.html).
The department is the oldest of its kind in Germany
and currently hosts seven principal investigators, nine
postdocs and 15 PhD students. It oers a stimulating,
supportive and highly international environment as well
as an excellent research infrastructure. The working
language of the department is English. Bielefeld is a
city of 325,000 inhabitants with an attractive historical
centre and easy access to the Teutoberger Wald for hik-
ing and other outdoor pursuits. It is an aordable and
pleasant city to live in and is well connected to mostmajor European cities.
The successful applicant will thus benet from an in-
tegrative, multidisciplinary training that will prepare
her/him very well for a scientic career in microbial
ecology / molecular ecology / conservation science.

search (BMBF). In this project, we aim to develop a
new approach to quantify the demographic resilience of
wildlife populations to environmental changes.
Deadline to apply September 23.
The selected candidate will develop this method us-
ing unique long-term datasets from two populations of
free-ranging spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the
Serengeti National Park and in the Ngorongoro Crater
in Tanzania, collected over a period of 35 and 26 years,
respectively. These two populations dier in their ecol-
ogy and in the disturbances they experience, including
anthropogenic ones. The candidate will apply capture-
mark-recapture models to assess survival and transition
probabilities among dierent states and construct ma-
trix population models. These matrices will then be
analysed using techniques from transient dynamics, to
assess and compare the demographic resilience of the
two spotted hyena populations. This method could
potentially be applied to a number of wildlife species
for which long-term data sets are available, and could
therefore lead to numerous collaborations.

DesertRodentEvolution
Project title: Phylogenomics and evolution of speciose
desert rodents (genera: Gerbillus)
We are looking for an enthusiastic student / researcher
to join project and expeditions to the Sahara to col-
lect data and accomplish research / PhD thesis. The
selected candidate will apply with the team for an inde-
pendent research position / PhD scholarship. Several
nancing opportunities exist within the supervisor team
institutions (see below).
Ongoing climate change, and extreme weather events,
raised concern for species survival throughout the world.
Some organisms have long coped with those problems,
by adapting to new conditions and seeking shelter in
suitable patchy areas. Therefore a promising approach
to predict the future of the species is to rst reconstruct
its evolutionary past. North Africa has been exposed to
frequent, and repeated, climatic oscillations. Therefore,
the Sahara desert can serve as a laboratory to study how
species respond to climate change and extreme condi-
tions. We study speciose Gerbillus rodents (estimated >
50 species) that inhabit arid habitats and deserts. Due
to remoteness of the area evolutionary history and ecol-
ogy of Saharan inhabitants has been rarely studied. Our
previous research showed high cryptic diversity within
Gerbillus rodents, and suggested ecological processes
involved in diversication.
With eld work in remote and distinct geographic loca-
tions, expected to host endemic and rare lineages and
species, and sequencing of historical museum samples,
this project aims in reconstructing phylogenetic history
(phylogenomics) to study biogeography and mechanisms
of diversication in harsh and uctuating desert condi-
tions.

for US citizens and permanent residents. Complete
information about the graduate program, including
application instructions, may be found at https://-
biosciences.rice.edu/how-apply-eeb . Prospective ap-
plicants are encouraged to contact potential faculty
advisors before applying. A full list of EEB program
faculty can be found here; in particular, the following
labs are actively recruiting new PhD students to start
in fall 2023:
The Beaudrot lab works at the interface of community
ecology, macroecology and conservation biology with a
particular focus on tropical forest systems and especially
on mammals. We are interested in variation in food
webs over space and time, tropical vertebrate responses
to global change, and determinants of tropical mammal
and bird community composition.
The Evans lab is looking to recruit 1-2 PhD students
who are interested in how complex traits evolve across
space and time in vertebrates. The Evans lab specializes
in the study of phenotypic evolution in shes with a
particular emphasis on the skull and the factors that
inuence its evolution and development.
The McCary lab is looking to recruit 1-2 PhD students
who are interested in understanding how global change
impacts insect communities. The McCary lab uses an
integrative approach, including experiments, modeling,
meta-analyses, and molecular techniques.
The Miller lab studies the spatial and temporal dynam-
ics of natural populations by combining theory, data,
and statistics. We are particularly interested in how
species interactions inuence patterns of distribution
and abundance. Most of our work is focused on plants
and their interactions with mutualists, competitors, and
consumers.
The Saltz lab seeks a PhD student who is interested
in the quantitative and evolutionary genetics of social
behaviors. We use fruit ies as a model system to test
hypotheses about how behavior evolves. We are a highly
collaborative group guided by our lab values.

SouthAfricaGermany
MarineMetabarcodingGenomics
PhD position in metabarcoding and population ge-
nomics of South African microbialite communities (bac-
teria, microalgae and metazoans)
The SSLiME (Supratidal Spring-fed Living Microbialite
Ecosystems) consortium invites applications for a PhD
position in marine metabarcoding and population ge-
nomics. The position is part of the project \Hydro-
logical and geobiological drivers of modern supratidal
microbialite connectivity and formation", and is fully
funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Col-
laborating institutions include the Helmholtz Institute
for Functional Marine Biodiversity at the University
of Oldenburg (HIFMB) and Alfred Wegener Institute,
Helmholtz-Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI)
(Germany), the Institute for Coastal and Marine Re-
search (CMR) at Nelson Mandela University (South
Africa) and the Centre for Ecological Genomics and
Wildlife Conservation in Johannesburg (South Africa).
This is a full-time position limited to 3 years. Can-
didates will be based at Nelson Mandela University
(NMU) in Gqeberha, South Africa (where the micro-
bialite formations to be studied are located), but are
expected to spend research time in Germany. Gqe-
berha (formerly Port Elizabeth) is a vibrant city on
South Africa's warm temperate Indian Ocean south
coast, and candidates will benet from interacting
with marine scientists from numerous disciplines at
NMU's recently established Ocean Sciences Campus.
The scholarship is R175,000 per annum (approximately
euro 10300 p/a). South Africa has a comparatively
low cost of living ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-
living/country result.jsp?country=South+Africa), and
this amount exceeds that of PhD bursaries paid by South
Africa's National Research Foundation. In addition, top-
up funding is available for excellent performance (papers
published).Background Microbialites (or stromatolites) are the old-
est commensal lifeform on Earth, appearing regularly
in the fossil record back to 3.45 billion years. Although
rare on modern coasts, when conditions are right, these
communities built by bacteria and algae may still form
today in the face of much more advanced competitors.
Recent research conducted in South Africa suggests that
instead of destroying them, modern metazoan fauna can
co-exist with microbialite formations. Together, they
create unique but poorly understood coastal habitats.
Research questions on the topic of biodiversity across
taxa and trophic levels (bacteria, microalgae, metazoans)
as well as biological connectivity of modern suprati-
dal microbialite pools will be tackled by comparing
community- and population-level similarities across the
network of microbialite-forming pools along the South
African coast, as well as adjacent estuaries (as much of
the metazoan fauna seems to be identical to, or derived
from, estuaries). It addresses whether the drivers of bi-
ological similarities between the supratidal microbialite
pool communities are spatial (i.e., a function of proxim-
ity to one another) or geographical (i.e. a function of
habitat continuity or discreteness).
Tasks The methods to be applied include metabarcoding
of environmental DNA (eDNA) samples from sediment
and water, and shallow whole genome sequencing of
key species from dierent taxonomic groups. The PhD
candidate will collaborate closely with an international
and interdisciplinary team, and a promising candidate
can thus expect strong support from a team of experts.
Tasks include: - Sampling and processing of eDNA (ex-
tracted from sediment and water) and individual species
(e.g. individually collected metazoans, or microalgal
cultures) with the assistance of local experts - Molecular
genetic analyses (DNA barcoding, metabarcoding, whole
genome sequencing) - Bioinformatic and statistical anal-
ysis of sequence data - Participation in, and, if necessary,
organization of project meetings - Preparation of project
reports and publication of results
Requirements The following requirements are highly
desirable, and the selection of the most suitable candi-
date depends on how many of them apply: - A Masters
degree (or equivalent pre-PhD qualication) in envi-
ronmental/natural sciences, medicine or a related disci-
pline - Experience with eld sampling and, preferably,
sampling of eDNA - Experience in molecular genetic
analysis using unix/linux-based approaches (metabar-
coding, metagenomics, RADseq/GBS or whole genome
sequencing data) - Strong bioinformatics and statistical
expertise - Availability for an international research stay
for sample analysis - Good communication and English
language skills - Publications, preferably as rst author,

UBern CichlidBrainEvolution
Doctoral Research Associate position (100 % or 4 years)
starting 1 Nov 2022 Dr. Zegni Triki, Ambizione fellow
of the Swiss Science Foundation at the institute of ecol-
ogy and evolution, University of Bern in Switzerland, is
oering a xed-term full-time (100%) PhD position for
four years to work on the costs of developing complex
brains and their cognitive benets in a cichlid sh. The
full-time occupancy salary is according to the Swiss
National Science Foundation and the University of Bern
guidelines.
As the main component of the nervous system, the brain
is the centre of information perception, processing, stor-
age, and decision-making. Comparative studies have
shown a strong positive link between cognitive perfor-
mance and indicators of brain complexity (e.g., brain
size, brain part sizes, neuron counts, and brain activ-
ity). However, growing and maintaining neural tissue
is energetically costly, and it is thus constrained by the
individual???s total energy budget. Researchers have
suggested a potential existence of an energy trade-o
manifested by a selective energy investment in the brain.
Although studies on the expensive tissue hypothesis have
made a tremendous contribution to our understanding
of the evolutionary forces of brain expansion by com-
paring dierent species, little is known about how the
hypothesis applies within species. The PhD student will
design and run experiments in the lab and potentially
in the eld (Lake Tanganyika) on the cichlid sh Neo-
lamprologus pulcher to further our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms aecting cognitive performance
by focusing on ontogenetic eects on individuals.
We are looking for a highly-motivated student with a
strong interest in interdisciplinary work. Applicants
should have a Masters??? degree in biology, or equiva-
lent. In addition, a background and ideally some experi-
ence with laboratory experiments (if possible with sh),
physiology, and the ability to ensure the well-being of
studied animals, are highly preferable.
Applicants should have excellent communication skills
and be able to work independently and as part of a
team. The working language of the Institute and the
lab is English; therefore, good prociency in spoken
and written English is a requirement. Also, the appli-
cant should have some experience with statistical data
analyses using programming languages like R.Are you interested? We look forward to receiving your
application, written in English, in one single PDF le.
The deadline is 20th September 2022, but the position
will stay open until lled. Applications in electronic
form or requests for further information should be sent
to Dr. Zegni Triki, email: zegni.triki@gmail.com
Applications should include: (1)a cover letter with a
statement of research interests and motivation (max.
2 pages), (2)a CV including details about research ex-
perience and publications (if any. Preprints are also
accepted), with contact details for at least three refer-
ees, and (3) the masters??? thesis manuscript (if not
already published); if the thesis is not in English, please
add a summary in English (1 page maximum).
Successful applicants will be invited to meet and discuss
with the group. The earliest possible start date is 1
November 2022.

UCCork SalmonEvolution
PhD student position in sh evolutionary ecology (UCC,
Ireland): Linking microevolutionary dynamics of At-
lantic salmon to multiple anthropogenic stressors includ-
ing climate change
We seek a highly motivated graduate who wants to gain
a PhD in the area of evolutionary ecology, working in
collaboration with scientists at University College Cork
(UCC), the Marine Institute of Ireland and Atlantic
Technological University (ATU). This 4-year position is
funded through a Science Foundation Ireland/Ireland
Research Council Pathway grant (https://tinyurl.com/-
SFIIRCEvodyngaas).
Anthropogenic pressures can dramatically alter the de-
mography and phenotypic composition of natural pop-
ulations. Evolutionary dynamics can also be aected,
but we currently lack understanding of patterns and
drivers of contemporary evolution. The objective of
the research programme is to understand the complex
processes of adaptation to anthropogenic impacts in the
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The specic aims are
to (1) evaluate the contribution of climate to historical
population-level genetic and demographic changes in
freshwater and marine environments and (2) assess the
scope for evolution of ecologically relevant traits. Us-
ing ecological genomics and quantitative genetics on a
six-decade long sampling programme on migrating At-
lantic salmon in Ireland, we aim to provide insights into
Atlantic salmon capacity to respond evolutionarily to en-
vironmental change, providing a basis for comprehensive
advice for future conservation and management.
The successful candidate will have the opportunity to be
involved in population genetics, landscape genomics and
quantitative genetics. The successful candidate will be
registered as a full-time research student in the School
of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences at UCC,under the supervision of Dr Joshka Kaufmann, Dr Rus-
sell Poole (Marine Institute), Dr Thomas Reed and Prof
Phil McGinnity (UCC). University College Cork and
particularly the school of BEES are committed to ad-
vance and apply our understanding of the natural world
through excellence in research, teaching and innovation.
The research team is part of a growing team of salmonid
researchers, with a broad network of collaborators across
academic and governmental institutions in Ireland and
abroad (https://sheye.ucc.ie).
The successful candidate will be primarily based at the
Marine Institute Newport research station in Newport,
Co. Mayo, Ireland. The Marine Institute Newport
research station is an international index site for di-
adromous sh, and a world leader in the use of in-situ
automated monitoring systems to track changes in fresh-
water systems. Situated on the west coast of Ireland,
Newport lies between the vibrant town of Westport and
the Wild Nephin national park. Candidates should pos-
sess at minimum a 2.1 BSc (Hons) degree (or equivalent)
in a relevant discipline (e.g. Ecology, Evolution, Zoology,
Genetics). Applicants must be self-motivated with good
communication, organisational and writing skills. Flu-
ency in English (especially for oral communication and
paper writing) is required. Experience working with
quantitative biology would be advantageous but not
essential; as would molecular laboratory and/or bioin-
formatics skills. Programming skills in using R, Perl or
Python is a plus. A driving license is recommended.
Remuneration: This position covers an amount equiv-
alent to fee rates plus a tax-free stipend of E18,500
p.a.
To apply please send by email a CV, details of
two referees, and an accompanying letter of applica-
tion outlining your relevant experience and why you
want to do this studentship to Dr Joshka Kaufmann

PhD Position available at the Institute of Ecology and
Evolution, University of Edinburgh, UK.28 EvolDir October 1, 2022
Rethinking evolution in self-fertilising species. Supervi-
sors: Matthew Harteld, Konrad Lohse.
A major goal of evolution is to understand how selection
acts in the genome. Many species reproduce via self-
fertilisation, where individuals produce both male and
female gametes that can be used to produce ospring.
Although there are many classic expectations on how
selng species evolve, these ideas are being challenged
by emerging population genomic data from selng or-
ganisms that have revealed unusual patterns of genetic
diversity and evolution. As a PhD student, you will
have the opportunity to develop novel computational
methods to understand fundamental evolutionary phe-
nomena, and use the results to make inferences from big
genomic datasets, especially those from Caenorhabditis
nematodes and self-fertilising plants.
Further information and application instructions:

PhD position: Evolutionary response to environmental
change
A PhD position in bioinformatics/evolutionary genomics
is available to study the functional genomic basis of adap-
tation to environmental change (with A/Prof Michael
Knapp at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New
Zealand).
The New Zealand bird fauna is unique in the world and
a key element of New Zealand's natural heritage. In the
absence of mammals, birds have evolved to ll their eco-
logical niches. This unusual situation has for example
given rise to the world's largest raptor, Haast's Eagle,
one of the few alpine parrot species in the world, the
kea, and the world's only ightless parrot, the Kakapo.
The molecular evolution of these adaptations can help
us understand how species respond to changing environ-
ments on the genome level.
We are looking for a PhD student to study the func-
tional genomic basis of adaptations such as island gigan-
tism and ightlessness in a range of New Zealand bird
species. The ideal candidate will have a background
in bioinformatics and genome data analyses. The po-
sition is contingent on the candidate obtaining a PhD
scholarship, either from the University of Otago (please
check eligibility: https://www.otago.ac.nz/graduate-
research/scholarships/phd/index.html) or alternative
international sources.
Selection process: Please apply by email with a cover
letter and your CV (including grade point average or
comparable measure from your qualifying degree) to
A/Prof. Michael Knapp (michael.knapp@otago.ac.nz)
by 02/October/2022. We will select the best applicant

Project Description: It is now well documented that
related species often exchange genetic material in the

tentially important player in biodiversity evolution, yet
poorly quantied and characterised. Modern genomics
oers unprecedented opportunities to ll this gap and
address several questions of great importance for our
understanding of evolution: under what conditions does
introgression occur, what is the role of natural selection
in promoting or impeding it, and the origin selection?
The project will focus on species of south European
hares (genus Lepus) that were aected by introgres-
sion from an arctic/boreal species that they replaced in
this region during the current deglaciation. Analysing
a collection of full genome sequences and additional
population genetics data, this project will aim to de-
tect and quantify all factors modulating introgression,
related for example with sex-linked transmission and
behaviour, the interplay between recombination rate
variation and genetic incompatibilities, positive natural34 EvolDir October 1, 2022
selection, and coadaptation between genomic regions.
This project will allow the acquisition of skills in bioin-
formatics and sophisticated cutting-edge population and
evolutionary genomics, by handling large-scale genomic
datasets. This work is expected to have a general im-
pact on the understanding of speciation and evolution
through genetic exchange, broadening our understand-
ing of biodiversity beyond species inventories. We oer a
dynamic working environment across labs in an interna-
tional collaboration with strong evolutionary genomics
expertise. We value motivation and strong interest in
evolutionary genomics research, teamwork skills and
creative thinking. Prior experience in analyses of high-
throughput sequencing data and bioinformatics skills
are assets.

PhD position: How isolated is Antarctica? Assessing
past and present plant colonisations
Antarctica has long been considered biologically iso-
lated from the rest of the world. Encircled by the enor-
mous Southern Ocean ?>` home to some of the world's
strongest oceanic and atmospheric currents ??" and
with a harsh, cold climate, the continent should be pro-
tected from natural incursions of non-native plants and
animals. However, the development of molecular tech-
niques in recent decades has revolutionised our capacity
to test for past dispersal events, and emerging data
demonstrates that natural incursions into Antarctica by
terrestrial species have occurred; the Southern Ocean is
therefore not the impenetrable barrier to dispersal that
it is often thought to be.
The project aims to discover how, when, and where
natural colonisations of the Antarctic continent have
occurred, focusing on mosses - the dominant Antarctic
plant group. Cutting-edge genomic tools will be com-
bined with environmental, spatial, and ecological data
to assess mechanisms and directions of dispersal to and
around Antarctica, and to predict areas most likely to
be colonised in the future. The research will help us
understand the processes underpinning evolution and
diversity of Antarctic species, and the vulnerability and
adaptability of their ecosystems. Such knowledge is
critical for Antarctic conservation in the face of rapid
environmental change.
We have generated next generation sequencing data from
museum specimens of Antarctic moss and are seeking a
PhD applicant with skills in population genomics and/or
bioinformatics - especially the analysis of exon capture
data - to work on the outlined topic. The successful
applicant will be based at the University of Waikato un-
der the Chief Supervision of Dr. Ang McGaughran, and
will be co-supervised by Assoc. Prof. Crid Fraser (Uni-
versity of Otago). There will be opportunities to spend
time in the Fraser lab and to participate in eldwork
(e.g., in locations such as New Zealand, South Amer-
ica, Australia, sub-Antarctic) to augment the existing
data with fresh collections and/or new locations. The
chosen applicant will need to be successful in an appli-
cation for a University of Waikato Doctoral Scholarship
( https://www.waikato.ac.nz/scholarships/s/university-October 1, 2022 EvolDir 37
of-waikato-doctoral-scholarship) - the closing date for
the next round of these applications is 30 September
2022 and the application (open to New Zealand citizens,
permanent residents, and international students) takes
place as part of the enrolment process. Because we
have some data in hand, an initial remote start could be
facilitated for the right candidate if border restrictions
in New Zealand require this.
To apply for this opportunity to do exciting, cutting-
edge research with real-world applications, pleasesend an interest statement and CV to: *amc-
gaugh@waikato.ac.nz*. Enquiries at the same email
address are welcome.

will address bold questions through rigorous, creative,
and integrative approaches. Beyond this, the range of
possible research areas within or intersecting evolution-
ary biology should be understood as broadly as possible.
We are excited to consider research focused across any
evolutionary timescale, at any level of biological hierar-
chy (e.g., molecules to ecosystems or even human social
systems), and employing any methodological approach
(e.g., empirical, computational, theoretical).

Hispanic Serving Institution Initiative Tenure Track
Assistant Professor Joint in Society and Genetics and
Integrative Biology and Physiology
POSITION DESCRIPTION UCLA's Institute for Soci-
ety and Genetics (ISG) and Department of Integrative
Biology and Physiology (IBP) are jointly recruiting a
tenure-track Assistant Professor faculty member to have
a split appointment in both departments. We are look-
ing for a scholar 1) whose research addresses fundamen-
tal physiological, cellular, and/or molecular processes
in a way that integrates (or plans to integrate) social
or societal dimensions and 2) who can successfully men-
tor Latinx undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral
students and trainees.
Candidates may come from any biological discipline
(including biological anthropology or public health). Re-
search eld, physiological system, and methodological
approach (e.g., wet lab, model systems, computational)
are open as well. Preference will be given to scholars
who creatively articulate how their current or future re-search engages physiological mechanisms that integrate
the biological (e.g., DNA repair, epigenetics, cellular
dynamics, circadian rhythm, hormonal signaling, micro-
biome, or metabolic integrity) and the social or societal
(e.g., touch, care, kinship, networks, foodways, pollution,
housing, migration, or displacement). Special consid-
eration will be given to scholars whose research also
intersects questions of health, wellbeing, and/or disease
aecting Latinx individuals or communities including
indigenous and Black Latinx populations especially in
the USA.
The Institute for Society and Genetics (https://-
socgen.ucla.edu/) is a multidisciplinary department of
social scientists, life scientists, and humanists analyzing
complex problems at the interface of biology and society
and training crossdisciplinary thinkers. The Depart-
ment of Integrative Biology and Physiology (https:/-
/www.ibp.ucla.edu/) employs experimental, computa-
tional, and quantitative approaches to study diverse
physiological systems, this has enabled discoveries of
how molecules, cells, tissues, and organisms solve bio-
logical problems essential for life. Successful candidates
should be able to articulate their research and mentoring
in ways that contribute to both scholarly communities.
This search reects the UCLA Division of Life Science's
commitment to diversify scientic research and training
and to support a new generation of underrepresented
minority scholars and trainees (especially from Latinx,
Black, and Native American backgrounds). UCLA aims
to achieve federal designation as a Hispanic Serving
Institution by 2025. In preparation for this designation,
the Oce of the Chancellor and the Executive Vice
Chancellor and Provost have sponsored this search in
order to recruit exceptional scholars whose teaching,
scholarship and/or mentoring has strong ties to Lat-
inx experiences in the United States. This search is
conducted in partnership between the Chicano Studies
Research Center and three units in the Life Sciences
Division the Institute for Society and Genetics (ISG),
the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology
(IBP), and the undergraduate Neuroscience IDP (uN-
SIDP). Faculty hired through this search are expected to
maintain an active aliation to the Chicano Studies Re-
search Center and encourage the success of Latinx and
rst-generation scholars. The HSI initiative prioritizes
the hiring of exceptional scholars who have connections
to Latinx experiences in the USA through their research,
teaching, and/or mentoring.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in
any relevant discipline. To apply, access the recruitment
via this direct link https://apptrkr.com/3438325 on the
UCLA Academic Recruit website. The following ma-
terials are required: 1) a cover letter introducing theOctober 1, 2022 EvolDir 65
candidate and articulating a vision for research, teach-
ing, and mentorship at the intersection of biology and
society, 2) full curriculum vitae; 3) a description of re-
search plans (2-3 pages); 4) a statement on teaching
and mentoring (1-2 pages); 5) a statement on contri-
butions to equity, diversity, and inclusion (1-2 pages);
6) three letters of reference. Initial review of applica-
tions will begin on October 17, 2022 and continue until
the position is lled. We highly encourage applications
from women, underrepresented minorities, and individ-
uals with a commitment to mentoring underrepresented
groups in the sciences.

theory in population genetics, creation of cutting-edge
statistical tools or software for population genetic in-
ferences, or application of advanced theory or statistics
to empirical data to draw inferences about evolution
or related elds. Candidates may focus on the popu-
lation genetics of single loci, genomes, or evolutionary
quantitative genetics. Empirical research, if any, may

MicrobialEvolution
Research technician in microbial evolutionary ecology
and host-microbiome interactions
Urban Lab: Theory suggests that rapid adaptation can
alter the assembly of communities by allowing the rst
colonists to adapt to novel conditions and limit the
establishment and success of future arrivals. This ef-
fect should be greatest in isolated habitats, where the
initial colonist has substantial time to adapt to local
conditions. We will work with Haloarchaea, which are
a taxa of extremophile microbes found in hot, salty con-
ditions around the world. Moreover, these organisms
can exchange genetic material and thus potentially alter
adaptive dynamics. The technician will participate in
all aspects of the project, including experimental evo-
lution, competition experiments, genomic studies, and
analyses, as well as explore further directions based on
independent skillsets and ideas. Additional responsibili-
ties include written and oral communication of research
results and mentoring undergraduate students. in mi-crobial evolutionary ecology and host-microbiome inter-
actions Bolnick Lab: Microuidic articial guts provide
a promising tool for studying the interactions between
vertebrate intestinal epithelial and immune cells, and
their gut microbiota. These interactions can be experi-
mentally manipulated with greater control than in live
vertebrates, and directly observed in real time. Working
with threespine stickleback (a small sh that is a major
model organism in evolutionary ecology), we have de-
veloped protocols for gut-on-chip experiments, and now
are embarking on experiments using this approach to
test for co-adaptation between gut microbiota and stick-
leback across disparate host populations with distinct
microbial communities.
Minimum qualications: The successful applicants will
have completed a degree in biology, including evolution-
ary biology, microbial biology, and ecology, genetics, or
a related eld prior to the start date. We are looking for
someone with strong laboratory skills working with mi-
crobes. Previous research experience and work records
should demonstrate a commitment to research, good
work ethic, lab skills, and organizational ability.
Preferred qualications: experience working with Ar-
chaeans and/or vertebrate gut microbiota, cell cultures,
and molecular genetics lab work. Strong organizational
and communication skills, as well as a demonstrated

DSN normalization

We plan to perform Expressed Exome Capture Sequenc-

that includes duplex-specic nuclease (DSN) normal-
ization of cDNA libraries. The DSN kit is produced
by Evrogen company (cat.# EA001) that is based in
Russia, and there are currently no options to purchase
the reagent due to the war embargo. After checking
all available options, I still don't have an idea where I
could get it from. Maybe there is someone out there
who could share the kit now so I can rebuy it when it's
possible?
Or maybe someone has experience how the normaliza-
tion step can be replaced?

PROGRESS MEETINGS IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOL-
OGY
We are excited to announce the next round of this ini-
tiative by the European Society of Evolutionary Biology
(ESEB), in partnership with the Journal of Evolutionary
Biology (JEB).
We invite applications for funding to support focussed
conference or workshops on a topical issue where rapid
progress is currently being made in understanding Evo-
lutionary Biology. ESEB will supply funds up to 15,000
Euro to assist with workshop planning (venue, travel or
attendance support). We encourage proposals on any
topic.
We expect these meetings to bring together a range of
researchers focussed around a topic for a \state of the
art" conference, ideally proposing a new synthesis, view-
point or technical or analytical breakthrough facilitating
new avenues of research. Attendees would represent re-
searchers from all career stages and must accord with
our Equal Opportunities guidelines. Attendance should
be open to all, but ESEB members should be prioritised.
Typically, meetings would last 2-3 days.
An important condition of the funding is that the meet-
ing has a clear objective to produce either a Special
Issue or Target Review for JEB. Organisers should aim
to have the manuscript(s) produced within 4 months of
the end of the meeting, and should detail how this will
be done in their applications. In the case of a Special
Issue, the organisers of the meeting or appropriate nom-
inees may serve as Guest Editors (where appropriate),
handling the peer review process for manuscripts arising
from the meeting with assistance from JEB editors.
There will be one call for applications per year, with
this year's deadline being NOVEMBER 15, 2022. Appli-
cants should be members of ESEB or our sister society,
the Society for the Study of Evolution.
There is no ocial application form. The application
document should include
- The title of the conference and why this is suitable for a
Progress Meeting. - Names and addresses of the organis-
ers, with short (1 page each) CVs - List of keynote speak-
ers, with justication (potentially key recent references).October 1, 2022 EvolDir 91
They should have agreed in principle to participate - A
2-page description of the aims and potential scope of
the conference - Conference venue details - Methods of
selecting participants - Publication plans
Queries and applications should be submitted to the
ESEB Oce (oce@eseb.org) by the deadline. Please
contact the ESEB oce again, if we have not conrmed
receipt of your application within a week. The successful
application will be chosen by an ESEB committee.

***ESEB GLOBAL EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY INI-
TIATIVE (GEBI) - Call for projects***
ESEB aims to foster the development and integra-
tion of local evolutionary research communities from
regions outside of the traditional strongholds of the
discipline and their links with the evolutionary bi-
ology community in Europe. To address this need,
we recently transformed the Global Training Initia-
tive, mainly focused on supporting training activities,
to the Global Evolutionary Biology Initiative (GEBI)
which can provide nancial, organisational and strategic
support as required (https://eseb.org/prizes-funding/-
global-evolutionary-biology-initiative/).
GEBI now welcomes applications to support new
projects in line with its aims (examples include meetings
to establish or strengthen local researcher networks, con-
ducting hands-on workshops to disseminate new tools
or methods, or developing curricula for teaching).
THE DEADLINE FOR THE CALL IS NOVEMBER
25th, 2022.
Applications should include a concise (up to two pages)
description of the proposed activity and a detailed bud-
get (in particularly specifying how the requested GEBI
contribution will be used). Actions fostering evolution-
ary biology in the long term are particularly appreciated,
and applicants are encouraged to describe how their pro-
posals may reach this long-term objective. Maximal
allowance is 10,000 euros/project.
Actions based in Western and Northern Europe, USA,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan are not
eligible for support by GEBI. Actions that are al-
ready covered by other ESEB initiatives/committees,
e.g. outreach activities or travel grants to individual
students/researchers for attending workshops or confer-ences are not eligible for support by GEBI.
Proposals should be addressed to oce@eseb.org (sub-
ject: GEBI call for proposals 2022). We will acknowl-
edge receipt of all applications within a week. If you
have not received our conrmation by then, please con-
tact the ESEB oce again!

TheoreticalSciencesVisitingProgram
Please see below regarding an opportunity for sabbat-
ical visits and thematic programs as part as OIST's
Theoretical Visiting Scientist Program. This program
is open to (among others) evolutionary theorists and
those developing quantitative methods for data anal-
ysis in evolutionary biology. The deadline listed as
Sept 30 guarantees full consideration, but applications
received suciently early in October will still be consid-
ered (please contact tsvp@oist.jp in this case to conrm
in advance).
1. Open Call for Visiting Scholars in the Theoretical
Sciences (April 2023-March 2024)
<goog 886830968 > https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp/-
application-visiting-scholars The Okinawa Institute of
Science and Technology (OIST) is inviting applications
for Visiting Scholars through its Theoretical Sciences
Visiting Program (TSVP).
The TSVP was launched in June 2021, with the goal of
bringing leading theoretical researchers to OIST for ex-
tended visits. In keeping with OIST's interdisciplinary
mission, the program spans all theoretical sciences in-
cluding, but not limited to, mathematics, theoretical
physics, computational sciences, and theoretical life sci-
ences.
Visiting Scholars will have the opportunity to carry out
independent research at OIST, and to interact with one
or more OIST Research Units during their stay. Visits
will usually be of 3 to 12 months, with support provided
for travel, accommodation and living expenses at the
level of per diem. No teaching duties come with the po-
sition. However, Visiting Scholars are expected to give
a general-audience lecture about their eld of research
within the rst month of their visit.
Appointment as Visiting Scholar may be taken while on
leave or sabbatical from another university. In excep-
tional situations, where the applicant does not receive
any salary from grants or their institution at the time of
their visit to OIST, successful candidates may be able
to apply for support with salary, where this is necessary
to facilitate the visit, and they can provide evidence of
their need. Visits of 1 to 3 months may also be approved
where special circumstances prevent a longer visit.
OIST is an institution with no departments, which aimsto eliminate barriers between people working in dier-
ent elds. We are an equal opportunity educator and
employer and are working actively toward increasing
the diversity of our faculty, students, and sta. We have
implemented policies to promote a diverse, inclusive,
and family-friendly culture. These include supporting
dual career couples, gender neutral facilities, \stop the
clock" options, and on-site child care. Further details
can be found at https://www.oist.jp/ . 2. Open Call
for Pre-Proposals for Thematic Programs in Theoretical
Sciences
https://groups.oist.jp/tsvp/proposal-thematic-
programs The Okinawa Institute of Science and
Technology (OIST) is excited to launch Thematic
Activity as new part of its Theoretical Sciences Visiting
Program (TSVP), with this call for pre-proposals.
The TSVP was launched in June 2021, with the goal of
bringing leading theoretical researchers to OIST for ex-
tended visits. In keeping with OIST's interdisciplinary
mission, the program spans all theoretical sciences in-
cluding, but not limited to, mathematics, theoretical
physics, computational sciences, and theoretical life sci-
ences.
Thematic Programs (TPs) are expected to be held at
OIST for 2 weeks to 3 months, starting in the second
half of 2023. TPs will be hosted by a group of two or
more researchers (coordinators) who will be invited to
stay at OIST for the duration of the TP. Successful
proposals will be provided with the nancial and admin-
istrative support needed to bring participants to OIST,
4-8 of whom are expected to be present at any one time.
Where it ts the goals and timeframe of the program,
a symposium linked to the program can be hosted at
OIST.

how the complexity of environmental stress (one or
more challenges) impacts genome structures and on
the rate of adaptation. All the groups have evolved
one or several organisms under various environmental
conditions in a replicated design and will generate
genomic sequences of the ancestral and evolved
individuals or populations. The aim of the postdoctoral
project will be to jointly analyze all these datasets,
to reveal the eect of environmental complexity on
the genomics of adaptation, from the rate of genomic
evolution to the molecular targets of adaptation, or the
level of genetic convergence within and across species.

IndianaU EvoDevoPlasticity
Postdoctoral Fellow: evaluating the proximate causes
and evolutionary consequences of developmental plas-
ticity
We are seeking a highly motivated and creative indi-
vidual to join the Led on-Rettig lab as a Postdoctoral
Fellow at Indiana University. We use interdisciplinary
approaches to understand both the proximate mecha-
nisms mediating developmental plasticity and its eco-
logical and evolutionary outcomes. To answer these
questions, we use spadefoot toads, whose larvae exhibit
extraordinary developmental plasticity in response to
dietary and social cues; further, this plasticity is associ-
ated with the evolution of novel and complex traits, such
as predaceous and often cannibalistic behaviors. A suc-
cessful candidate will combine transcriptomic, genomic,
endocrine, behavioral and morphological analyses to un-
derstand (1) how these traits arose evolutionarily, and
(2) how early life responses to the environment carry-
over into adulthood and future generations, through
transgenerational mechanisms.
We use this non-model amphibian because of its uniqueenvironmental responsiveness, yet, the system oers an
abundance of tools for molecular investigation, including
several species with published genomes and transcrip-
tomes. We currently house a colony at Indiana Univer-
sity to facilitate controlled, experimental investigation
of developmental plasticity, and collect our animals from
the eld, both locally and in the Southwestern United
States.
For more information on our group, please visit our lab
website (ledonrettig.com)
Indiana University: Indiana University hosts several
mechanisms for postdoctoral training. We are the home
of CISAB, the Center for the Integrative Study of An-
imal Behavior, which provides laboratory, networking,
and funding resources for behavior research. We are
also home to NCGAS, the National Center for Genome
Analysis Support which provides training and workshops
to those using genomic data. Additionally, our lab is
positioned down the hall from IU's Center for Genomics
and Bioinformatics, which provides library construction
and next-generation sequencing, as well as consulting.
Location: Bloomington is a culturally rich community
in close proximity to outdoor activities such as hiking
and kayaking. Bloomington oers an abundance of live
music, art galleries, a variety of festivals and weekly
farmers markets.
Minimum qualications: A PhD is required by the start
of the appointment; expertise in any area of science will
be considered, as long as the applicant is enthusiastic
towards the goals of our research. Evidence of previous
scientic scholarship is necessary. Experience with next-
generation sequencing data analysis and computational
genomics is highly desirable, but not required. Salary:
Commensurate with qualications and experience, plus
benets.
Best consideration date: November 30.2022
Anticipated start date: April 2023, although specic
start date is negotiable
To apply: Please submit (1) a cover letter explaining

One and a half year post-doctoral research position on
the landscape genomics of forest trees and their ectomy-
corrhizal fungi
This post-doctoral fellowship is available as part of a
collaboration between the French National Research
Institute for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment
(INRAe) Grand Est-Nancy and the Swiss Federal Insti-
tute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL,
within the framework of the ?MAGIC? project nanced
by LABEX-ARBRE and SwissForestLab.
At INRAe, the Ecogenomics of Interaction team seeks
to understand the network of genes, proteins, metabo-
lites, and environmental signals that lead to the complex
ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in forest trees. The team is
investigating the role of mycorrhizal fungi in organic
matter degradation and the mechanisms involved in
nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems using comparative
and functional genomics, biochemistry, bioinformatics,
environmental microbiology and ecology approaches.
At WSL, the Research Unit Biodiversity and Conserva-
tion Biology studies the diversity of life in its various
forms, from genetic diversity to the diversity of species
and ecosystems as well as their interactions. The Eco-
logical Genetics group investigates ecological processes
in populations of plants, mycorrhizal fungi and animals
using genetic methods. It explores how plants and myc-
orrhizal fungi evolve to adapt to changing environmental
conditions, and to what extent mycorrhizal fungi play a
role for the stability of forest ecosystems.
In the joint research project, we aim to identify sig-natures of selection in beech trees to drought periods
and enlarge this knowledge to belowground adaptation
processes. In particular, we want to know whether the
ectomycorrhizal fungi of forest trees are adapted to their
local habitat and whether the tree and the fungi form a
co-adaptation complex that could confer benets under
adverse environmental conditions.
You will lead analyses of fully sequenced genomes to
study population genomics and gene variants involved
in drought resistance of beech trees along a water avail-
ability gradient in Switzerland. In parallel, you will
handle large genomic data of the ubiquitous ectomy-
corrhizal fungal species, Cenococcum geophilum, and
perform genotype?environment association analyses to
unravel the genomic basis of local adaptation. In collab-
oration with both partners, you will publish the results
in international scientic journals and present them
at dedicated conferences. The applied aspects of your
ndings will be disseminated to practitioners via media
dedicated to lay forestry.
You have acquired a PhD in microbiology or plant biol-
ogy, with a strong background in population genomics
and evolutionary biology as well as competences in bioin-
formatics. You should be acquainted with combined
statistical analysis of environmental and genomic data.
Experience with plant?microbe interactions and exper-
imental work would be advantageous. You are eager
to communicate and collaborate in uent English with
a multicultural and international group and are used
to working independently. Moreover, you have a well-
structured working attitude and demonstrate a high
level of team spirit. You are willing to be hired for the
rst 12 months at INRAe and the following six months
at WSL, with supervision from both institutions. Flexi-
bility is expected in this regard.
Deadline for application is October 31, 2022. The posi-
tion is open from January 1, 2023, with possible adjust-
ments for the starting date.
To apply, please send your complete application
in a single pdf le to Annegret Kohler (an-
negret.kohler@inrae.fr) and Benjamin Dauphin (ben-
jamin.dauphin@wsl.ch), including (1) a cover letter de-
scribing your research interests and background (2 pages
max.), (2) a detailed CV (2 pages max.) with full publi-
cation list, and (3) the contact details of two referees (1
page max.). INRAe and WSL strive to increase the pro-
portion of women in its employment, therefore women
are particularly encouraged to apply for this position.

Project description: The aim of the postdoc project
is to ll the gap between classical phylogenetics and
population genetics, and provide a multi-scale approach
for the estimation of natural selection that incorporates
intra- and inter-specic data.
This work will be based on the theoretical work by Kaj &
Mugal (doi: 10.1016/j.tpb.2016.06.003), which provides
analytical solutions for the inuence of polymorphism
on the estimation of selection in classical phylogenetic
approaches. The novel approach will implement the
theory in order to compute the transition probabilities
between polymorphic states and xations among species.
For integration of the population genetics theory into a
phylogenetic setting, the work will also rely on models
of speciation dynamics (starting with the simplest mod-October 1, 2022 EvolDir 103
els of speciation, so-called isolation-without-migration
models).
The novel approach will be implemented in Bio++ li-
braries, which are a set of C++ libraries dedicated to
bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and molecular evolution.
Finally, building on these developments, the postdoc
will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of bat genes
that lie at the core of the BATantiVIr project.
Skills: The candidate has a good knowledge of molecular
evolution, and a solid basis in mathematical modelling.
She/he is familiar with bioinformatics, population ge-
netics and phylogenetic concepts. Last, she/he is au-
tonomous in C++ programming.

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Bioinformatics and Compar-
ative Genomics
A postdoctoral training position is currently available
in the Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch
(CSGB) of the National Human Genome Research In-
stitute (NHGRI). The position is in the laboratory of
Andy Baxevanis, Ph.D., whose research group uses com-
parative genomics approaches to better-understand the
molecular innovations that drove the surge of diversity
in early animal evolution. The overarching theme of
Dr. Baxevanis' research program is focused on how non-
traditional animal models can be used to convey critical
insights into human disease research, in line with the
NIH Intramural Research Program's renewed emphasis
on developing new animal models for the study of basic
biology.
With this translational context in mind, Dr. Baxe-
vanis' group is currently leading international eorts
to sequence two cnidarian species: Hydractinia and
Podocoryna. The regenerative abilities of these colonial
hydrozoans make them excellent models for the study
of key questions related to pluripotency, allorecognition,
and stem cell biology, work that will be signicantly ad-
vanced by the availability of high-quality whole-genome
sequencing data from these organisms. The success-
ful applicant will have the opportunity to develop and
apply bioinformatic approaches to these and other large-
scale genomic data sets, focusing on the evolution of
specic protein families and biological pathways thatOctober 1, 2022 EvolDir 107
have putative roles in disease causation.
Candidates should have or be close to obtaining a Ph.D.
or equivalent degree in bioinformatics, computational
biology, computer science, molecular biology, or a closely
related eld. Candidates with a background in compar-
ative genomics or evolutionary biology are particularly
encouraged to apply. Programming skills and experience
in the application of computational methods to genomic
data are highly desirable. Applicants must possess good
communication skills and be uent in both spoken and
written English. The ability to learn how to use new
software and quickly become expert in its use, critical
thinking, problem-solving abilities, and the ability to
work semi-independently are required.
The NIH Intramural Research Program is on the
Bethesda, Maryland campus and oers a wide array of
training opportunities for scientists early in their careers.
The funding for this position is stable and oers the
trainee wide latitude in the design and pursuit of their
research project. The successful candidate will have ac-
cess to NHGRI's established and robust bioinformatics
infrastructure, as well as a Top 500 high-performance
computing resource available through NIH's Center for
Information Technology.
Interested applicants should submit a curriculum vitae,
a detailed letter of interest, and the names of three poten-
tial references to Dr. Baxevanis at andy@mail.nih.gov.

of the National Natural History Museum, Luxembourg
(MNHNL). The postdoc will work with Alain Frantz (PI)
and Julian Wittische (previous holder of the post-doc),
and is funded by the Luxembourg Research Fund.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION The overall objective of the
ongoing study is to better understand the connectivity
of typical Luxembourg landscapes from the viewpoint
of pollinators. We aim to understand whether urban-
ization has an impact on pollinator dispersal and, if
there is sucient landscape resistance to create isola-
tion, which landscape features facilitate or hinder gene
ow. We will use genetic data to make inferences about
genetic structure and eective dispersal. During the re-
mainder of the project, we want to apply this approach
to two target species in one large area with signicant
urbanization (Southwest of Luxembourg).

DesertEvolutionPhylogenomics
Project title: Phylogenomics and evolution of speciose
desert rodents (genera: Gerbillus)
We are looking for an enthusiastic student / researcher
to join project and expeditions to the Sahara to col-
lect data and accomplish research / PhD thesis. The
selected candidate will apply with the team for an inde-
pendent research position / PhD scholarship. Several
nancing opportunities exist within the supervisor team
institutions (see below).
Ongoing climate change, and extreme weather events,
raised concern for species survival throughout the world.
Some organisms have long coped with those problems,
by adapting to new conditions and seeking shelter in
suitable patchy areas. Therefore a promising approach
to predict the future of the species is to rst reconstruct
its evolutionary past. North Africa has been exposed to
frequent, and repeated, climatic oscillations. Therefore,
the Sahara desert can serve as a laboratory to study how
species respond to climate change and extreme condi-
tions. We study speciose Gerbillus rodents (estimated >
50 species) that inhabit arid habitats and deserts. Due
to remoteness of the area evolutionary history and ecol-
ogy of Saharan inhabitants has been rarely studied. Our
previous research showed high cryptic diversity within
Gerbillus rodents, and suggested ecological processes
involved in diversication.
With eld work in remote and distinct geographic loca-
tions, expected to host endemic and rare lineages and
species, and sequencing of historical museum samples,
this project aims in reconstructing phylogenetic history
(phylogenomics) to study biogeography and mechanisms
of diversication in harsh and uctuating desert condi-
tions.

PrincetonU HostParasiteEvoEco
Postdoctoral Research Associate Position in the Evolu-
tionary Ecology of Host-Parasite Interactions
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in-
vites applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate
or more senior research position to work with ProfessorAndrea L. Graham, for an NSF-funded project in collab-
oration with Professor Clay Cressler of the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln. Graham Group research interests
include immune and parasite dynamics within hosts,
parasite transmission between hosts, and, more gener-
ally, the evolutionary ecology of immunity, infection and
disease. Members of the group collect data both in the
lab and in the eld, and frequently use mathematics to
investigate processes that determine the strength and
ecacy of immune responses. The Cressler Lab develops
novel mathematical models that link within-host and
between-host processes to understand the dynamics and
evolution of infectious diseases.
This project (Ecology of expulsion: Within-host dy-
namics driving nematode infection) focuses on mouse-
nematode-microbe interactions and is designed to test
the hypothesis that feedback loops between induced
immune responses and parasite growth ultimately deter-
mine the duration of nematode infection and therefore
the tness impacts for both hosts and parasites. Our
preliminary mathematical modelling suggests that these
feedbacks lead to immunological Allee eects, such that
subtle dierences in dose, initial T-helper cell bias, or
induction rate can lead to either an acute infection that
is rapidly cleared or else to chronic infection.
The researcher will be primarily responsible for generat-
ing data to test these predictions, using dose-response
and rewilding experiments with multiple readouts. Re-
sponsibilities will include: planning and execution of
experiments, including sampling; development and ex-
ecution of immunoassays; molecular and microscopic
methods to identify and quantify symbionts; cell culture;
optimization and use of ow cytometry; parameteriza-
tion of mathematical models; and data analysis.
The researcher will be encouraged to lead the intellec-
tual development of the project according to their own
vision and skillset, in consultation with the project team.
Depending upon interests of the person recruited, duties
may also include supervision of undergraduate projects;
curation of sample collections; and participation in the
Broader Impacts aspect of this project, which will use
theatre to bring immunology to a wide public.
The appointment is for one year initially, with the pos-
sibility of renewal of an additional year, based on sat-
isfactory performance. Salary is competitive and com-
mensurate with experience, and benets are included.
This position is available immediately and will be open
until lled.
Essential qualications:
- A Ph.D. in an appropriate eld of science (e.g., im-
munology, parasitology, ecology, evolutionary biology) -October 1, 2022 EvolDir 111
Experience in animal handling, optimizing immunoas-
says or sequencing pipelines - Skills in at least one of the
following: eldwork, mathematical analysis, cell biology
- Experience supervising other laboratory personnel
Ability to work independently as well as to lead a team,
attention to detail in laboratory work, and meticulous
record-keeping are paramount. Strong organizational
skills and excellent communication skills are also essen-
tial. Finally, the job will require the ability to review
agreed goals, to analyze processes necessary to achieve
those goals, and to develop techniques and systems to
meet those goals.
Preferred qualications:
Experience with live-trapping of animals in the eld,
statistical analysis, or animal breeding is preferred, as
is training in animal physiology or veterinary medicine.
How to apply:
Applicants should apply at https://www.princeton.edu/-

SangerInst Speciation
We are looking for a postdoctoral Fellow interested in
the role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation to
join theMeier Groupfor 3 years. Chromosomal rearrange-
ments are thought to have the potential to contribute
to speciation as they can cause hybrid sterility and
suppress recombination, potentially linking co-adapted
genes. There is old-standing theory on this, but testing
the hypotheses has been challenging due to the diculty
of identifying chromosomal rearrangements. However,
now it has become possible to assemble genomes at
a large scale at institutions such as the Sanger Insti-
tute. Ithomiini butteries are an ideal study system
to test long-standing hypotheses on the causes and ef-
fects of chromosomal rearrangements as this species-rich
tribe of South American butteries shows very rapid
chromosomal evolution (Brown et al., 2004, Hereditas).
While the vast majority of butteries kept the ances-
tral number of 31 chromosomes, ithomiini species show
large variation in chromosome number, ranging from
5 to 120 chromosomes. In the two very closely related
species we have already analysed, we nd that their
chromosomal dierences are not due to simple fusions or
ssions, but involve complex rearrangements (Gauthier
et al., in review). Ithomiini butteries also show within-
population variation in karyotypes (McClure et al., 2018,
Cytogenetic and Genome Research). Some genera have
radiated rapidly into multiple species, whereas others
show much lower speciation rates. Ithomiini butteries
are thus ideal to test predictions on interactions between
chromosomal evolution and speciation.In collaboration with researchers in Ecuador, Colombia,
Brazil, France and the UK, we are currently collecting
butteries to assemble about 200 reference genomes of
representatives of all ithomiini lineages. Our team mem-
bers and collaborators are currently identifying genes
under selection, such as those contributing to warning
colour patterns in these mimetic butteries. You will
have a background in genomics to use the genome as-
semblies to answer questions on chromosome evolution
and speciation. You will have a collaborative mindset
and good team work skills. Essential Skills:
- PhD in evolutionary genomics, population genetics
or other relevant area - Demonstrated analytical and
problem solving skills - Demonstrated team work skills
and collaborative approach to research - Clear written
and oral communication skills - Experience in processing
large genomic datasets on parallel computing clusters -
Demonstrates Inclusivity and respect for all.

you meet the criteria set out above and in the job

do host abundance, reproduction, age, and condition
dierentially or interactively inuence viral diversity;
(2) how do molecular immune mechanisms respond
to environmental and physiological stressors in wild
populations; and (3) how do gene expression proles
and viral infection inuence one another in the wild?
The postdoctoral researcher at Stony Brook and

nessing population genetic data to predict biodiversity
responses to shifting climates. Evidence is accumulat-
ing that spatially-explicit genetic data from landscape
genetic studies may be instrumental in predicting, track-
ing, and managing biodiversity responses. Nonetheless,
evidence accumulated to date remains idiosyncratic and
poorly synthesized, thus we still lack a unied under-
standing of the link between genetic variation across
space and biodiversity responses in time. This project
aims to integrate existing landscape genetic and epige-
netic data, both within our single core study system and
model system of range shift genetics (the blue-railed
damsely,Ischnura elegans), and across multiple species
in a comparative context, to improve our understanding
of biodiversity responses.
The ideal candidate has a strong background in bioin-
formatics and population genetics, especially under non-
equilibrium demographic conditions, and is interested
in applying this knowledge to data synthesis and model
integration to improve eco-evolutionary forecasting.
The position is supported by a strong team of population
genetics empiricists and modellers (led by Lesley Lan-
caster, Kara Layton, Greta Bocedi, and Justin Travis),
who are embedded within a global collaborative net-
work that will maximize both the impact of the work

of Ecology and Vertebrate Zoology
DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS:
20 0ctober 2022
An exciting postdoctoral position funded by the Pol-
ish National Science Centre (NCN, grant EXILE) is
available at the Department of Ecology and Verte-
brate Zoology of the University of A odAo(Poland)
under the supervision of Philippe Kok (STELLAR Re-
search Group, see http://www.philippekok.com/stellar-
research-group/). The position is oered for one year,
renewable for an additional year (thus 2 years) and is
available from January 2023.
Brief scientic summary of the project: While poten-
tial responses of vertebrateEXobIoLogy on Earth) is
to explore, document and understand how environmen-
tally hostile naturally fragmented paleosurfaces may
have driven/altered peculiar behavioural, bio-physical
and eco-physiological adaptations, and ultimately the
evolutionary trajectories of vertebrates. EXILE fo-
cusses on the \Lost World" moonlike tabletop moun-
tains of northern South America (tepuis). We hypothe-
size that ancient endemic lineages of vertebrates thriv-
ing on these paleosurfaces, such as the toad genus
Oreophrynella and the lizard genus Riolama, have
developed unique behavioural, bio-physical and eco-
physiological traits/strategies to cope with the tepuis'
highly contrasted environmental conditions. EXILE
stems from our previous work in this unique system
and was inspired by unconventional ndings, testimony
to the tremendous research discoveries yet to be made
in this unusual ecosystem. It is well known that body
temperature and water balance are jointly inuenced by
heat and water exchange within the organism and be-
tween the organism and its environment. This exchange
is modulated by (i) the biophysical and physiological
properties of the organism and by (ii) behavioural strate-October 1, 2022 EvolDir 127
gies. Biophysical properties include morphology, surface
properties, and metabolic modes. For instance, skin
colour, thickness, and ultrastructure in reptiles and am-
phibians determine heating capacity and resistance to
water loss. EXILE will specically focus on two main
complementary research axes: (1) thermal biology, and
(2) bio-physical adaptations to dehydration. We will
use selected Pantepui amphibians and reptiles on a sin-
gle tepui summit at ca. 2,800 m elevation. In order
to situate these results in the appropriate ecological
and evolutionary context, we will also investigate non-
insular upland (ca. 1,000 m elevation) closely-related
taxa in the surrounding Pantepui tropical rainforest,
as well as the closest relatives of the tepui taxa living
in a Neotropical post-Pleistocene landscape at similar
elevation (ca. 2,800 m elevation in the sub-paramo in
the Andes). Field expeditions coupled with the use of
advanced techniques such as highly sensitive thermal
imagery, including the use of drones to record thermal
images of the landscapes from the air, will be carried
out to complete our project. We will also run a va-
riety of cutting-edge behavioural tests, either in the
native environment of the animals or in our eld lab-
oratory, and use modern imagery techniques (such as
high-resolution X-ray microcomputed tomography and
electronic microscopy).

UMaryland EvolutionAgingBats
The Wilkinson lab at the University of Maryland, Col-
lege Park, seeks to hire a postdoc to join a new NSF-
funded Biological Integration Institute titled \Discover-
ing the mechanisms and evolution of aging dierences
between females and males." The postdoc will be re-
sponsible for obtaining samples and data from multiple
species of bats that will contribute to complimentary
datasets generated by other members of the institute
and be used to test hypotheses and develop predictive
models.
The goal of the institute is to investigate how genome
architecture, organismal biology, and phenotypic plas-
ticity contribute to sex-specic aging and its evolution.
The postdoc would help capture and sample bats from
at least 12 dierent species and then process samples to
obtain data on DNA methylation, gene expression, trans-
posase accessible chromatin, mitochondrial function and
DNA damage repair. Field, lab and computational work
will be involved. The Institute involves 11 co-PIs at 8
institutions each of whom will collect comparable data
from young and old males and females from a variety
of dierent animals. Cross-training in new techniques
from other members of the institute will be available.
This is a two-year appointment with potential for re-
newal for two additional years.
*Qualications* A Ph.D. in biology or related eld is

ExperimentalEvolution
mostdoctoral position in Montpellier (24 months): Anal-
ysis of evolution meta-experiment
https://tinyurl.com/y4u3njt2 We are looking to hire a
2-year postdoctoral researcher (PDR), starting in Jan-
uary 2023, to analyze a large evolution meta-experiment,
carried out in parallel on a range of model organisms
(from viruses to plants). This work is part of the project
ComplexAdapt, funded by the program BiodivOc from
the region Occitanie, and the experiments are performed
by dierent research groups from the consortium Ex-
pEvolOcc. The objective is to understand how the
complexity of environmental stress (one versus multiple
challenges) aects the rate of adaptation, in terms of
change in absolute tness (population growth rate). All
the groups are measuring tness at dierent time points
along the experiment on their model organisms. The
aim of the postdoctoral project will be to jointly analyze
all these datasets, to reveal transversal patterns that
may be confronted to theoretical predictions from the
literature, as well as identify key drivers of dierences
among systems.
Supervision: The PDR will be based at the CEFE in
Montpellier (GEE team), but with regular visits to the
ISEM (a few hundred meters apart), and will be jointly
advised by Luis-Miguel CHEVIN (CEFE), GuillaumeOctober 1, 2022 EvolDir 129
MARTIN (ISEM), and Emanuel FRONHOFER (ISEM).
All have expertise at the interface of experiments and
theory, with complementary specicities (tness con-
cepts and measurements, demography and evolution
across environments, analysis of meta-experiments). In
addition, the PDR will regularly interact with all mem-
bers of the consortium ExpEvolOcc, to assess the con-
sistency of the analyses in the light of the knowledge
base on each particular system.
Requirements:
- Demonstrated strong expertise in advanced statisti-
cal analyses: (Bayesian) hierarchical models and/or
meta-analysis, time series and/or population dynamics
analysis.
- Solid organizational skills: homogenizing and handling
a database compiled from data collected by dierent
groups using dierent measurement devices (spectrome-
ter, cytometer.).
- Excellent relational abilities: Capacity to work on
a large collaborative project, requiring numerous ex-
changes with network members, so as to ensure the
homogeneity of analysis among datasets collected inde-
pendently
- Interest for ecology and evolution, especially the dy-
namics of adaptation to new environments (theory,
experiments), experimental evolution, microbial ecol-
ogy/evolution, and/or population dynamics.
Broader context: Montpellier is host to an large com-
munity of ecologists. The PDR will directly benet
from this stimulating research environment, by being
based in two of the largest research institutes on ecology
and evolution. The PDR will also interact on a regular
basis with all members of the consortium ExpEvolOcc,
based in institutes with very strong departments in
ecology (SETE Moulis), microbiology (IHPE, LIPME),
or infectious diseases (MIVEGEC), providing a unique
opportunity to build their academic network.
Salary: Wage will follow rules from the University of
Montpellier, and will depend notably on experience.
French salaries include social benets such as health
insurance.
Application process: Applicants should send a sin-
gle PDF le including a cover letter (maximum 2
pages), a CV with a list of publications, and the con-
tacts for 3 references, to Luis-Miguel CHEVIN (luis-
miguel.chevin@cefe.cnrs.fr), Guillaume Martin (guil-
laume.martin@umontpellier.fr), and Emanuel Fronhofer

Project: Connectionist Approaches to Modelling Evolu-
tionary Transitions in Individuality (evo-ego)
Application Deadline: 13th Sept 2022 (hopefully ex-
tended to Sept 25th) Salary: 40,931 to 46,047 GBP*October 1, 2022 EvolDir 131
We welcome applications for a postdoctoral researcher
to build computational models of evolutionary processes,
at the lab of Richard Watson at the University of
Southampton. The position is available, for a dura-
tion of up to 19 mths, starting Oct 2022 or as soon as
possible thereafter.
About the project:
This project (funded by the John Templeton Founda-
tion) investigates the evolutionary transitions in individ-
uality, such as the transition from unicellular life to mul-
ticellular organisms. The approach will build on recent
developments unifying evolutionary theory with learning
theory (Watson & Szathmary, 2016, TREE, 31(2), 147-
157). This work converts (connectionist) models of dis-
tributed learning and cognition, already well-developed
in computer science/neural networks/machine learning,
to deepen and expand our understanding of natural evo-
lution. The candidate will use computational modelling
to explore the evolution of network structure and its
eect on ecological/developmental organisation and evo-
lutionary capabilities. This will characterise the type of
relationships and organisation that is needed to convert
a collection of (previously) independent evolutionary
individuals into a new level of organisation that func-
tions and evolves at a new, higher level of individuality.
In particular, we will explore the hypothesis that the
conditions that enable evolution to exhibit a transition
in individuality are predicted by the conditions that en-
able learning systems to induce and exploit deep models,
a.k.a. deep learning.
The successful candidate, based in Southampton, will
also work with co-investigators Chris Buckley (Univer-
sity of Sussex, UK.) and Mike Levin (Tufts University,
USA). As a part of this team, the candidate will also
work closely with PhDs and another post-doc dedicated
to this project and on related projects.
The candidate:
Appropriate skill sets include computational mod-
elling of gene-regulation networks, ecological dynam-
ics/community network modelling, theoretical popu-
lation genetics, mathematical modelling of biological
evolution, social evolution theory, adaptive dynamics,
evolutionary game theory, computational individual-
based modelling, complex adaptive systems, algorith-
mic/functional modelling of evolutionary adaptation.
Applicants must be capable of building bridges that
link between evolutionary biology and computer sci-
ence and have a PhD or equivalent professional quali-
cations and experience in either evolutionary theory
(e.g. adaptation, selection, evolutionary systems biology,
mathematical biology, social evolution theory), withstrong mathematical skills and experience in simulation
modelling/programming, OR a PhD in computer sci-
ence/maths/physics (e.g. algorithms, machine learning,
complex systems/dynamical systems modelling, optimi-
sation) with strong knowledge/experience of working on
applications in theoretical evolutionary biology.
Applications must include a CV, publications list, the
names of three referees and a covering letter explaining
your current interests and relevant background.
Equality, diversity and Inclusion is central to the ethos
in the School of Electronics and Computer Science. We
particularly encourage women, Black, Asian and minor-
ity ethnic, LGBT and disabled applicants to apply for
this position. We are committed to improving equality
for women in science and have been successful in achiev-

Location: University of Wolverhampton, UK Deadline:
Sunday 11th September Salary:  >1
236,382 - 43,434 pa
Western Melanesia-including New Guinea-sits at the
crossroads of Asia and Australia and is one of the most
interesting, puzzling, and understudied hyper diverse
regions on Earth. Clarifying how tectonic movements
have sundered or joined dierent Melanesian landforms
in the past several million years is key to understanding
the origins of this biotic diversity. The Postdoctoral Re-
search Associate will be a major participant in helping
to investigate how the diversity and evolutionary his-
tory of the ve major geological landforms that comprise
most of western Melanesia have impacted evolution of
that region's biota and to identify those ancient insu-
lar landmasses critical in generating the lineages that
colonised and radiated across New Guinea, Australia,
and/or insular Asia. The project will investigate evo-
lutionary relationships among the region's reptiles and
amphibians to address these questions. The research
will help to replace the outdated, unidirectional \out-of-
New-Guinea" model for origins of Pacic biodiversity
with a more dynamic and nuanced understanding that
ancient, yet under-appreciated, land areas in Melanesia
have long been important in shaping biotic evolution in
the broader region. The project will use a combination
of traditional sequencing methods alongside sequencing
of ultra-conserved elements (or similar) from fresh and
historic museum samples (aka archival DNA) and anal-
yse these data with respect to new geological models to
be generated by a project partner.
We are seeking to appoint a postdoctoral research as-134 EvolDir October 1, 2022
sociate to study the Origins of Western Melanesian
Herpetological Diversity on a 36 month, xed-term con-
tract. This project is funded by a joint NERC-NSF grant
to Dr Simon Maddock (University of Wolverhampton,
UK) and Dr Fred Kraus (University of Michigan, USA).
The position will be based in the School of Sciences at
the University of Wolverhampton, UK; with some time
spent in the USA and Papua New Guinea. The success-
ful applicant will possess the skills and knowledge to
contribute to research, dissemination, and knowledge
exchange as part of the project.
You will have completed a PhD in biological sciences or
an equivalent subject, have experience of laboratory and
phylogenetic methods, and have disseminated research
in international scientic journals and conferences. Dur-
ing your tenure, you will be responsible for collecting
tissue samples in Papua New Guinea (particularly on
Bougainville, Solomon Island Archipelago), generating
sequence data (Sanger and sequence capture), analysing
data, disseminating research, and co-supervising under-
graduate and postgraduate students. Good communica-
tion and organisational skills are essential attributes.

Online GettingTheMostOutOfR
Oct3-6
Dear all,
last days to register for the 2nd edition of the Physalia
course \Getting the most out of R"
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/gmr/ )
Dates: Online, 3-6 October 2022
Many scientists start using R for very specic purposes
with little training in computer science, data organiza-
tion, and software development. Even advanced users
may bypass important tools and abstractions which can
ultimately lead to bad habits and wasting time. Get the
most out of R by exploring topics that usually fall out-
side of data analysis and visualization curricula. This
course will cover blind spots in existing materials by
working through the intermediate steps in various pairs
of problems and solutions that often get overlooked
because of assumed knowledge.

Online RNASeqAnalysis Oct31-Dec5
Dear evolutionary biology community,
RNA-seq experiments have become ubiquitous in bio-
logical research, yet the downstream data analysis can
feel a bit like a black box. As a result, we may over-
or mis-interpret our results, or simply fail to draw all
the scientic insight that we could be drawing from our
data.This is an intense online course, running from the 31st of
October till the 5th of December 2022. We will be meet-
ing every Monday and Thursday from 2pm till 4.30 pm,
Lisbon time. In addition, there will be a small weekly
assignment to do, with individualised written feedback
each time, so you always know where your strengths
and weaknesses lie. We will focus less on knowing all
the newest and coolest tools, and more on achieving
an intuitive understanding of the statistical concepts
underlying the analyses.
Like at all Mondego Science courses, we will follow these
principles:
1. Understanding beats memorisation - you should never
perform an analysis that you don't fully understand con-
ceptually. 2. Intuition beats equations - we will keep the
maths to a bare minimum. There are no pre-requisites
in terms of maths, statistics or programming skills. 3.
Practice beats theory - we will immediately apply ev-
erything we learn to real data sets. 4. Working together
beats working alone - as much as possible, we will per-
form practical exercises in teams.
You should take this course if you
- will soon have to perform gene expression analysis for
the rst time and want to go in with a strong conceptual
basis.
- already analyse RNA-seq data but feel like you insu-
ciently understand the statistical concepts underlying
the analyses.
- collaborate with bioinformaticians who analyse your
RNA-seq data and want to be able to speak to them in
their language.
15 places are available on a rst-come-rst-served basis.
Registration closes on Oct 15.

TropicalConservationGenetics
Sep12-23
LAST CALL
Registration ends this Friday Sept 2
We are happy to announce Conservation Genetics in the
Tropics 2022, which will be all online this year.
Many conservation genetics tools have been developed
for use in temperate other high latitude habitats, and so
not all of these tools translate to the tropics. Tropical
habitats share some features which complicate the ap-
plication of some conservation genetics tools which are
heavily relied upon in higher latitudes, and also share
some basic questions and problems that are less of an
issue in higher latitudes or other, better studies and/ or
less diverse habitats.140 EvolDir October 1, 2022
This course will discuss practical issues, genetic and
genomic theory, tools and analyses as applied to issues
relevant to conservation in the tropics. Some basic
questions of conservation importance include describ-
ing species diversity, determining species distributions,
characterizing the basic biology of species, and under-
standing demographic history and population size and
structure. Underlying biogeographic histories that have
shaped communities, and the biotic interactions within
those communities are also of fundamental importance.
There are online computer practicals in parallel with
the lectures, seminars and discussions.
This course is designed with students and practitioners
of Conservation Biology or Conservation Genetics in the
tropical regions of America, Africa and Asia in mind.
This course will take place September 12 - 23 entirely
online, hosted by the Estacion Biologica de Donana
(www.ebd.csic.es). In order to best accommodate peo-
ple across many time zones, this course will consist of a
combination of pre-recorded lectures and seminars, and
synchronous discussions and practicals. The course will
be held in English.

Vienna ExperimentalEvolution
Dec5-9
LAST CALL FOR PRACTICAL SESSIONS
Last chance to apply; applications for the practicals of
this course close this Friday, September 30th.
The Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics is
now accepting applications for the course \Experimental
evolution: bringing theory and practice together" at the
University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, *DecemberOctober 1, 2022 EvolDir 141
5-9, 2022.*
Experimental evolution is extensively used to address
questions of evolutionary biology by exposing evolv-
ing populations to dierent environmental conditions.
It oers the opportunity to replicate experiments and
test for convergent outcomes. With the recent drop in
DNA sequencing cost and the advance in sequencing
technologies, the combination of experimental evolution
with next-generation sequencing of pools of individuals
(Evolve & Resequence) has become a state-of-the-art
method to link phenotypic responses to genetic changes.
Although the availability of replicated time series data
is one key advantage of E&R, analysing such data sets
is still in its infancy. This course will introduce the
participants to several new approaches for the analysis
of genomic time series data, covering the latest software
tools as well as required statistical and computational
skills.
The course is targeted toward researchers interested
in experimental evolution combined with NGS. It will
cover the design of experimental evolution studies as
well as the analysis of Pool-Seq time series data. The
course aims to introduce participants to:
- State-of-the-art software packages - Modelling of neu-
tral data - Identifying selected regions - Haplotypes
reconstruction from time-series data - Estimating selec-
tion coecients - Calling transposable elements in time
series data - Inferring selection in transcriptomics data
Morning lectures by internationally renowned faculty
will be followed by computer practicals on the analysis
of experimental evolution data in the afternoon.Speakers:
- *Christian Schl otterer* (Vetmeduni Vienna, AT) -
*Henrique Teot onio* (IBENS, FR) - *Paul Schmidt*
(University of Pennsylvania, US) - *Ron Bassar*
(Auburn University, US) - *Megan Behringer* (Van-
derbilt University, US)
*Call for participants: applications are open until the
end of September 2022.*
The course is free but will be number-restricted for the

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.142 EvolDir October 1, 2022
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
