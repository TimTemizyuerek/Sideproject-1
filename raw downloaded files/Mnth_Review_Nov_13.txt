Symposium on Epigenetics in Ecology and Evolution
Epigenetics, the science of reversible but heritable
changes in gene expression has grown to maturity in
the last years. The tremendous advancements of tech-

transcriptomes and proteomics into reach of almost any
laboratory has also made possible the comprehensive
analysis of epigenomes. The understanding that epige-
netic modications are involved in almost all develop-
mental processes, and several examples that show en-
vironmentally induced epigenetic changes have fueled
the hope to better apprehend how the environment and
genetic and non-genetic heritable information interact
and allow for adaptive evolution.
The research community in this latter eld shares com-
mon concepts and fundamental question but is con-
fronted to the technical diculties associated with the
heterogeneity of their models. The French CNRS INEE

SMBE Satellite Meeting on Reticulated Microbial Evo-
lution Christian-Albrechts University Kiel, Germany,
27-30 April 2014
Conference website: http://www.smbeme.org Lateral
gene transfer (LGT) is the process by which prokaryotes
acquire DNA across wide taxonomic boundaries and in-
corporate it into their genome. Accumulating evidence
shows that LGT, a distinctly non tree-like evolution-
ary process, plays a major role in prokaryote evolu-
tion. Virtually all prokaryotic gene families have been
aected by LGT and only few gene families are resis-
tant to it. The biological and evolutionary signicance
of lateral gene transfer has broad implications for our
understanding of microbial biology, not only in terms of
evolution, but also in terms of human health: both the
emergence of antibiotic resistance and the emergence of
novel infectious diseases themselves often results from
bacterial virulence mechanisms that can be newly ac-
quired, for example in the form of pathogenicity islands,
via LGT.
Our aim for this SMBE satellite meeting is to bring to-
gether scientists working in the elds of genome evolu-
tion, microbial ecology, and networks research in order
to further develop the application of network models
to the study of microbial genome evolution. We ex-
pect that a multidisciplinary joint meeting of scientists
in those elds will add substance and progress to the
study of reticulated (non tree-like) events during evo-
lution.

Reminder
Dear all,
This is a reminder for a conference on *\Genetic Re-
sources for Food and Agriculture in a Changing Cli-
mate" *in Lillehammer, Norway, 27th - 29th of January
2014.
The main aims of the conference are to:
- contribute to an understanding of climate change and
its predicted impact on agriculture and forestry - in-
crease our understanding of adaptive genetic diversity
and adaptation - assess how genetic resources for food
and agriculture are aected by the changing climate -
discuss the consequences that climate change challenges
bring upon the sustainable utilization of plant, animal
and forest genetic resources
The conference aims at bringing together participants
from all areas relevant to genetic resources for food and
agriculture in a changing climate. The conference will
focus on the scientic frontiers in this area as well as
create a possibility for discussions from the political
point of view.
The conference is organized by the Nordic Genetic
Resource Center (NordGen, http://www.nordgen.org/-
index.php/en/content/view/full/2/) and four research
networks under a program entitled \Climate Change
Impacts, Adaptation and Mitigation in Nordic PrimaryNovember 1, 2013 EvolDir 7
Industries" nanced by the Nordic Council of Ministers
and NordForsk. The results of three years of network
activity of the four networks will be presented during
the conference.
The meeting is directed towards scientists, PhD stu-
dents and young scientists, national genetic resource
coordinators, breeding association representatives, gov-
ernment ocials and other stakeholders with special in-
terest in genetic resources for food and agriculture in a
changing climate.
Please, follow the link below to the conference home-
pages for the scientic program, call for abstracts
(*deadline 30th of November*), and registration and
practical information.

Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the Third Meeting of the
Network for Neotropical Biogeography (NNB3) that
will take place at the Universidad de los Andes in Bo-
got a, Colombia, on January 7{10, 2014. The theme of
the meeting will be ^ aSpace, Time, Form and Genes.'
The event includes pre-meeting workshops (Jan. 7{8)
and optional post-meeting eld trips to unique Colom-
bian habitats.
Please visit the conference website http://-
nnb3.uniandes.edu.co for updated information or
contact nnb3@uniandes.edu.co.
The Network for Neotropical Biogeography (http:/-
/nnb.myspecies.info) promotes scientic interactions
across disciplines and taxa with the following goals: -
Promote scientic interaction - Stimulate the exchange
of material, students and researchers - Increase inter-
disciplinarity between dierent elds - Discuss and plan
joint projects and grant applications - Stimulate collab-
orative eldwork and reciprocal help with eld collec-
tion of research material - Inform on upcoming events,
recent papers and other relevant material
The NNB was established during a symposium at
the BioSystematics conference in Berlin in February
2011. A second meeting, with the theme ^ aIntegrating
Neotropical Research,' was held at the Montgomery
Botanical Center, Coral Gables, Miami, Florida, USA,
on January 14th, 2013 immediately following the 6th
Biennial meeting of the International Biogeography So-
ciety.
Tropical America - the Neotropics - is the most species-
rich region on Earth. Understanding the mechanisms
underlying the historical assembly and evolution of
this extreme biodiversity constitutes a major challenge
in biology, and will require hitherto unrealized inter-
disciplinary scientic collaboration.
We look forward to seeing you in Bogot a!

UZurich EolutionaryPlantRadiations
Jun13-14
Evolutionary Plant Radiations Meeting Institute of
Systematic Botany, University of Zurich, Switzerland
13-14 June 2014
Recent developments are providing exciting new in-
sights into the evolutionary dynamics of species diversi-
cation and the importance of evolutionary radiations,
or rapid episodes of lineage diversication. The aim
of this meeting is to explore questions about where,
when and why plant evolutionary radiations happen,
and how they proceed. The meeting will bring together
contributions spanning: (i) new models of species di-
versication, including paleodiversity and trait evolu-
tion, and the increasingly sophisticated and powerful
tools available for testing hypotheses about diversica-
tion trajectories and their causes; (ii) the proliferation
of new molecular phylogenetic data, for more and larger
plant clades spanning broader taxonomic, geographical
and temporal levels, as well as opportunities for un-
precedented phylogenetic resolution of rapidly evolving
clades coming from genome-scale DNA sequence data;
(iii) assembly of more comprehensive species geographic
distribution, functional and life history trait data sets
that are enabling more accurate and complete recon-
struction of biogeographic and trait evolution histories
and interactions; (iv) empirical studies of key plant
radiations ^A for understanding the contributions of bi-
otic interactions (pollinators, herbivores, pathogens) as
drivers of radiations, the interplay between ecological
opportunity and evolutionary innovation in driving ra-
diations, and the mechanisms of radiations in terms of
underlying population ecology and speciation.

of Natural History.
The student will be given the unique opportunity to
lead a project that both generates phylogeographic data
on Neotropical birds and develops programs for analyz-
ing genomic-scale phylogeographic data. The eld of
phylogeography has entered the genomics-era, but the
tools for analyzing large multilocus data sets are lim-
ited.
This opening oers an opportunity for independent re-
search co-mentored by Brian Smith and Mike Hicker-
son. The duo empirical and quantitative focus of the
collaboration between these two research groups will
involve 3-4 postdoctoral researchers, 4-5 PhD students
and access to large-scale population genomic data. The
prospective student will be able to take advantage of the
tremendous resources at CUNY and AMNH. The two
labs are located in northern Manhattan and will bene-
t from a thriving academic environment in New York
City.
The ideal candidate will have a strong interest and ap-
titude in quantitative biology, modeling, and program-
ming as well as evolutionary genetics and biogeography

SymbiosisAndMetagenomics
The Russell Lab at Drexel University seeks driven and
enthusiastic Ph.D candidates to join them in the De-
partment of Biology for the Fall of 2014. The best ap-
plicants will have background experience in molecular
ecology, microbiology, microscopy, or entomology. Stu-

symbiosis in ants.
The central theme in the Russell lab is the ecology and
evolution of symbiosis, and we are addressing the fol-
lowing questions in the ant system:
First, what host features correlate with the composi-
tion of symbiotic communities across the ants? And
what do such correlations tell us about the likely causes
and consequences of symbiosis in this group? We are
specically interested in the question of whether mi-
crobes have facilitated the origins of herbivory across
the ants, and are using experimental and metagenomic
approaches to address this possibility.
The lab is currently made up of three graduate students
who will serve as experienced mentors for incoming stu-16 EvolDir November 1, 2013

ETH Zurich ModellingVirology
PhD position in mathematical immunology and virol-
ogy at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland:
A PhD position is available in the group of Roland Re-
goes at the ETH Zurich (see www.tb.ethz.ch/research/-
Regoes). In our group we study quantitative aspects of
infectious diseases within their hosts.
We are looking for a PhD student interested in study-
ing the within host dynamics of viruses and their in-
teraction with the immune system. Applicants for the
positions should have strong quantitative skills. We
therefore encourage people with a background in math-
ematics, biostatistics, bioinformatics or physics to ap-
ply. The starting date can be as soon as possible, but
we are fairly exible what that is concerned.
The specic questions, which we would like to address
over the next years, revolve around infering the popu-lation dynamics of the virus from high-throughput ge-
netic data. We would like to nd out what the viral
sequence data, collected in infected hosts over time,
tells us about the replication and spread of the virus
within its host. We also plan to investigate the popula-
tion dynamics of B-cells using detailed genetic data on
antibody responses.
Experience of population genetics would be advanta-
geous, but s not absolutely necessary. The research in
our group is conducted in close collaboration with ex-
perimental groups in Switzerland and oversees.
Our group is strongly linked with the theoreti-
cal biology group of Sebastian Bonhoeer (http:/-
/www.tb.ethz.ch/research/Bonhoeer) who works on
the emergence and dynamics of drug resistance. This
means that we have common group meetings, and the
PhD student and the postdoc will be exposed to a wide
range of interesting research on infectious disease dy-
namics.
Zurich is a great place to live and to do research. It
is the home of two big universties (the University of
Zurich and the ETH), and is an attractive city in beau-
tiful surroundings with a multinational population and
many educational and recreational opportunities.

FloridaIntlU ProteinEvolution
The Siltberg-Liberles Lab at Florida International Uni-
versity in the Department of Biological Sciences is look-
ing for highly motivated graduate students with an in-
terdisciplinary interest in evolutionary, structural and
computational biology. Our research program is cen-
tered on the interplay between structure and function
in protein evolution.
Currently, we are focused on elucidating the evolu-
tionary dynamics of dierent protein features, such
as conformational, functional and regulatory exibil-
ity. These features are fundamental for cellular plas-
ticity. Fluctuations in these features among closely
related species oer a route to biological divergence.
We work on large scale data analysis across the tree of
life in order to reveal novel evolutionary mechanisms
as well as on small scale projects targeted to e.g. mis-
folding disease, virulence, and signal transduction with
more direct biomedical applications. Central to all
projects are the evolutionary and structural context.
For additional information, see the lab page (http://-
siltbergliberleslab.wix.com/siltberg-liberles), our home
department (http://biology.u.edu/). We are also al-
iated with the Biomolecular Science Institute (http://-sish.u.edu/initiatives/biomolecular-and-biomedical/).
Successful applicants should have a background in
bioinformatics or computational biology, evolutionary
biology, molecular biology, biophysics, or biochemistry.
Programing experience is preferred. The successful ap-
plicant should have the capacity to work successfully
both as an individual and in a team setting.
We call for graduate students (MS and PhD) to start
in the Fall of 2014. If you are interested in applying for
a graduate position, please send a letter of interest to

EvolutionSignalDiversity
PhD position (4 years) to study the evolution of sig-
nal diversity: role of mimicry and predator general-
ization in polymorphic, aposematic wood tiger moth
(Parasemia plantaginis) populations
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD-candidate
with a background in evolutionary biology, evolution-
ary ecology, animal behaviour or entomology. A back-
ground working with insects (lepidopterans) and/or
birds is a bonus. The chosen candidate will need to
enjoy eldwork, laboratory work, and have a passion
for research science.
Short project description: Evolutionary radiations are
fascinating because the rapid evolution of morphologi-
cal diversity provides a natural laboratory for studying
the mechanisms leading to population divergence and
speciation. Because the genetic changes involved in di-
vergence often take place before reproductive isolation18 EvolDir November 1, 2013
is complete, studies of young radiations, where the ac-
tion of current selection can be more directly observed,
can provide the most interesting picture of the diversi-
cation process. The wood tiger moth Parasemia plan-
taginis shows dramatic dierences in warning coloration
among geographic locations. Our recent work, along
with phenotypic variation, show signicant dierences
in the level of genetic divergence among populations. In
this project, we aim to test the hypothesis that this ra-
diation arises from signal sharing among interspecics
i.e M ullerian mimicry. This project will utilize an inte-
grative approach (combining elds of evolutionary ecol-
ogy and behavioral ecology via comparative and exper-
imental methods), and asks whether warning-coloured
Lepidopteran fauna show signs of convergence among
dierent geographic locations.
What we can give: the opportunity to join our
happy, active and international research group.

The Project: The scincid lizards of New Guinea are a
diverse, complex and unique assemblage of lizards, rep-
resenting over 70% of the lizard fauna on this \megadi-
verse" island. Several species of New Guinea skinks
have evolved an unusual physiology - lime-green blood
and tissues, a result of accumulation of biliverdin, a bile
pigment. The adaptive signicance of hyperbiliverdism
is unknown, but two alternative hypotheses (distaste-
fulness and crypsis) have already been ruled out. Bile
pigments have been shown to be toxic to malaria para-
sites (Plasmodium), thus an anti-parasitic adaptation is
possible. Preliminary data collected by the PI's show a
trend towards reduced levels of Plasmodium infection
(and other blood parasites) in green-blooded lizards,
but an improved phylogeny of the hosts and more in-
tensive sampling of the prevalence and parasitemia of
the malaria parasites are needed to more conclusively
test this hypothesis. Thus, the goals of this project
are to conduct eldwork in Papua New Guinea and use
a large number of tissues and blood samples already
in hand to obtain better estimates of the diversity of
skinks and their malaria parasites, to describe any new
species of skinks and malaria parasites, to resolve the
phylogeny of the Melanesian species group and improve
the diagnoses of both genera and species in this clade
and then to test for patterns of parasitism in relation to
the phylogeny and the physiology of these hosts. In ad-
dition we will use new high throughput next-generation
DNA sequencing methods to sequence the genomes of
lizards with green blood and closely related lizards with
normal red blood in order to assess biomedical impor-
tant genomic and proteomic innovations related to hy-
perbiliverdinism. The research looks at the evolution
of one of the world's most exceptional vertebrate phys-
iologies in order to explore the connections between ge-November 1, 2013 EvolDir 19
netic variation, molecular function, and disease. Un-
derstanding the genetic and proteomic adaptations of
hyperbiliverdinism will provide an expansive multidis-
ciplinary view of bile pigment physiology and will lead
to new ways to think about bile pigments and jaundice
and in doing so contribute to biomedicine and improve
human health and economic development.

ChimpanzeeMHCPhD Position: MHC Variation in Wild Chimpanzees in
the Primatology Department of the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Evolutionary Anthropology
Although much is known about the patterns of
functionally-neutral genetic variation in wild animal
and human populations, we understand much less
about the distribution of genetic variation underlying
physiologically important traits. The genes of the Ma-
jor Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) play a critical
role in the immune response by coding for molecules
which present antigens to immunocompetent cells. This
project will use our recently developed protocols for
next generation sequencing of DNA from noninvasive
samples to characterize variation at multiple loci of the
MHC in wild chimpanzees. The degree of functional
diversity in individuals will be assessed and compared
among individuals, communities, populations, and sub-
species. This project does not involve eld research,
but will incorporate use of behavioral and demographic
data and fecal samples from wild chimpanzees that are
the subjects of long term observation by collaborators
in the eld. This position will be within the molecular
genetics group (http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/les/-
genetics.htm) in the Primatology Department at the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
in Leipzig, Germany.
The Leipzig School of Human Origins (http://-

gram of the University of Leipzig (Germany) and the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.
This program provides interdisciplinary training and re-
search opportunities for university graduates who wish
to work towards a Ph.D. in anthropology, biology, evo-
lutionary genetics, primatology, paleoanthropology and
related elds. Our graduate school is conducted in En-
glish, open for international students and designed as
a 3-year-program with a research focus and a limited
amount of formal classwork.
*Qualications/Experience*: We invite applications
from all countries. Applicants should have a Mas-
ter's degree before the start of the program. Candi-
dates should be uent in written and spoken English.
Knowledge of German is not required but international
students have the opportunity to take free German
courses. For this project a background and keen in-
terest in molecular biology laboratory analyses is a dis-
tinct advantage and a background in anthropology or
primatology is helpful but not necessary.
*Salary/funding*: Ph.D. students are supported for the
duration of their PhD by tax-free stipends of approxi-
mately15,000 Euro per year. There are no tuition fees,
and low cost health insurance is available. Leipzig is20 EvolDir November 1, 2013

HybridSpeciation
Two positions for PhD students in evolutionary genet-
ics of hybrids:
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Pl on,
Germany PhD position on novel traits and genotypic
selection in hybrid sh PhD position on the evolution
of gene expression of hybrid sh Application deadline:
November 30th 2013
The group \evolutionary genetics of shes" lead by Dr.
Arne W. Nolte at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on, Germany, is oering two PhD
positions that are funded within the framework of the
ERC starting grant \EVOLMAPPING". The goal of
this project is to analyze evolutionary change in inva-
sive Cottus, a lineage of sh that represents an exam-
ple for the early steps of hybrid speciation. We will
combine analyses of gene expression, genetic mapping
and screens for genotypic selection in laboratory popu-
lations and wild sh to identify the links between geno-
typic and phenotypic evolution to infer the evolution-
ary impact of natural hybridization. PhD candidates
should begin their work in spring 2014 and summer
2014 respectively. The salary of the PhD candidates
will be according to the standard German pay scale in-
cluding all social benets (TV oD E13/2 salary).
One PhD project to commence in spring 2014 will focus
on the inference of genome wide patterns of selection in
the evolving gene pool of invasive Cottus to identify ge-nomic traits that play a key role in adaptive evolution
and the invasion of new habitats. The task of the stu-
dent will be to study genome evolution in hybrid sh
using various approaches as for example through anal-
ysis of the size of ancestral genomic blocks and gene
copy number variation. The analyses will be based on
Next-Generation sequencing data and use conventional
genotyping to validate results. The candidate should
be interested in population genetics and computational
biology as it is part of the work plan to develop and
extend the analysis of genomic sequence data.
The second PhD project to commence in summer 2014
will focus on the evolution of patterns of gene expres-
sion in invasive Cottus. The central objective of this
project is to study gene expression in the lab and in
nature, and to identify phenotypic plasticity and evo-
lutionary novelty in invasive Cottus. The development
of an inclusive microarray and the analysis of gene ex-
pression will be based on a wealth of transcriptome and
genome sequences that facilitate a very inclusive devel-
opment of a state of the art microarray. This project
is adequate for a candidate who is talented in working
with live animals and able to do short experiments in
the eld.
We oer an English speaking and ambitious working en-
vironment at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on, Germany. The Institutes main elds
of work include evolutionary ecology (Prof. Dr. M.
Milinski), evolutionary genetics (Prof. Dr. D. Tautz)
and evolutionary theory (Prof. Dr. Arne Traulsen)
and experimental evolution (Prof. Dr. P. Rainey) and
hosts a number of research groups. The MPI in Pl on
collaborates with the nearby Christian Albrechts Uni-
versity of Kiel, Germany in a joint International Max
Planck research school that attracts PhD students from
abroad which contributes to a multicultural working at-
mosphere. We encourage PhD students to join the IM-
PRS which grants a high level of supervision, access to
courses and an international peer group.
The Max Planck Society is committed to employing
more handicapped individuals and especially encour-
ages them to apply. The Max Planck Society seeks
to increase the number of women in those areas where
they are underrepresented and therefore explicitly en-

GRADUATE STUDIES IN EVOLUTIONARY DE-
VELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
I am seeking graduate students interested in studying
the evolution and development of neuroectoderm spec-
ication in marine invertebrate deuterostome embryos,
including echinoderms, hemichordates, and cephalo-
chordates. Students interested in pursuing either an
M.S. or Ph.D. degree will be considered. **
Research in our lab deals with one of the fundamen-
tal questions in evolutionary and developmental biol-
ogy - how signaling and transcriptional regulatory in-
teractions pattern embryos along the embryonic axes
during development. These axes form the framework
upon which the animal body plan is built. By combin-
ing molecular manipulations, high-throughput genome-
wide assays, gene regulatory network analysis and clas-
sical embryology the lab hopes to understand the de-
velopmental events that regulate axis specication and
patterning in deuterostome embryos, which include
chordates, hemichordates, and echinoderms. Current
projects in the lab examine how information from dif-
ferent Wnt signaling pathways is used to activate and
repress the gene regulatory networks that pattern the
neuroectoderm along the anterior-posterior axis in the
echinoderm sea urchin embryo. The lab is also in-
terested in using the information gained from the sea
urchin embryo as the basis to examine the evolution of
anterior-posterior neuroectoderm patterning in hemi-
chordates and invertebrate chordates. **
Funding for tuition, benets, stipend, and summer
salary for this position is guaranteed through teaching
assistantships, but there exists the potential for funding
through research assistantships. **
Mississippi State University serves more than 20,000
students and the National Science Foundation ranks
the university among the top 100 public and private re-search institutions. The Department of Biological Sci-
ences is home to a diverse, interdisciplinary faculty that
provides instruction and training in evolutionary biol-
ogy, development biology, systematics, genomics, pop-
ulation biology, organismal biology, microbiology, cell
biology and physiology. Our faculty currently has fund-
ing from the National Science Foundation, the National
Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association,
and the Environmental Protection Agency, among oth-
ers. More information about the graduate program and
department is available at www.biology.msstate.edu .**

in the wild during the nestling provisioning phase. The
project will address questions such as: To what extent
is the behaviour of pairs coordinated in time or space?
And how is behaviour modied by proximity to the22 EvolDir November 1, 2013
partner or signalling by the partner?
Requirements: We are looking for a highly motivated
and enthusiastic person with an MSc or equivalent de-
gree in evolutionary or behavioural ecology, or a re-
lated eld, and with strong eld, experimental and an-
alytical skills. Candidates must be willing to organise

NSF-IGERT Genetic Engineering and Society: The
case of transgenic pests. We are looking for one
or two students interested in applying the tools of
evolutionary biology to important global challenges.
Genetic pest management involves the manipulation
of pest populations to suppress transmission of dis-
eases like malaria, and to decrease densities of agri-
cultural pests. Evolutionary biology has an impor-
tant role for informing the design of the selsh genetic
elements that drive transgenes into the pest popula-

http://geneticengsoc.ncsu.edu/ Questions about ge-
netic pest management are technical and scientic, but
also deeply social. We believe students must acquire
both an understanding of the technologies underpin-
ning genetic pest management as well as an understand-
ing of the social context in which those tools might be
used. Because no single student can master all these
complexities, our goal is to sponsor an academically
and culturally diverse group of about six students in
Fall 2014. With roughly equal representation of stu-

mathematics/natural sciences, IGERT fellows in Ge-

Elucidating the unknown ecology of bacterial pathogens
from phylogenetic data
Our knowledge of how bacterial pathogens have evolved
is currently hampered by inadequate information on the
full ecology of these organisms. We propose to use cut-
ting edge genome analysis techniques to combine infor-
mation on phylogeny and recombination allowing us to
reconstruct dierences in ecological niches which exist
between pathogenic and commensal bacteria. To do
this we will work on two comprehensive data sets pre-
viously generated by our group on E. coli and Yersinia.
This project has been selected for consideration
for a fully-funded Vice-Chancellor's PhD bursary at
Nottingham Trent University, twelve PhD projects
will be funded across the University in 2014.

For the above project we are seeking a highly moti-

actively explore and regulate their social environment
using communication signals, how the early improvisa-

into adult song, and how they can learn eective sig-
nalling strategies.
This will be achieved by developing computational
models, and designing a sound installation based on
dierent song development strategies where the song
properties are an emergent property of the system. You
will explore how dierences in cognitive ability, oppor-
tunity to learn, and complexity of the social system
combine to produce a particular signalling system and
level of improvisation. The predictions and solutions
that arise from these computational models will be com-
pared against the literature available on the wide vari-

I am seeking an outstanding PhD student to study
marine population dynamics using population genetic
and genomic techniques. My research group has
broad interests in marine ecology, population genet-
ics/genomics, climate change, biogeography, dispersal,
and sheries. Student projects will generally overlap
with these areas, but independent thinking and new
ideas are strongly encouraged. Our lab is small, and
I expect to devote substantial time to each student's
intellectual and professional development.
Potential projects include (but are not limited to) 1)
metapopulation dynamics of coral reef shes and im-
plications for marine reserve design, 2) local adapta-
tion in coral reef or northeast U.S. shes, and 3) im-
pacts of climate change on population dynamics and
biogeography. All projects would likely involve high-
throughput population genomics and ecological model-
ing, but within each project there is much scope for in-
dividualization based on student interest and aptitude.
All projects can involve a mix of eld work (includ-
ing opportunities to build from existing program in the
northeast U.S. and in the Philippines), wet lab work,
genetic bench work, and computing. Enthusiasm, ex-
cellent written and oral communication abilities, and
strong quantitative skills are necessary.
**Application process** Interested candidates should
send an email describing their motivation and re-
search interests along with a CV, GPA, and GRE
scores (if available) to malin.pinsky@rutgers.edu. In-
progress applications to external fellowships are

PHD POSITION - THE ECOLOGY OF EVOLUTION
OF FLOWERING TIME, at the Department of Ecol-

versity, Sweden
Project description: The project will investigate how
interactions with pollinators, seed predators and her-
bivores drive variation in phenotypic selection on tim-
ing of reproduction in perennial plants. An important
part of the project is to identify and examine situations
with opposed selection from dierent selective agents.November 1, 2013 EvolDir 27
Other important parts are to link among-population
dierences in selection from mutualists and antagonists
to the environmental context, in terms of abiotic con-
ditions or community composition, and to assess the
eects of opposed selection on lifetime tness using de-
mographic information.
The study systems will include several perennial plant
species and their pollinators, herbivores and pre-
dispersal seed predators. The studies will be carried
out mostly in southern Sweden, but also studies over
larger spatial scales might be included. The methods
will include data collections from multiple populations
to assess variation in strength of selection over environ-
mental gradients, as well as eld and common garden
experiments to identify the causes of dierences in se-
lection. The analytical framework will mainly consist
of phenotypic selection analyses, but will also include
demographic analyses. The PhD position is available
as a part of a Swedish Research Council (VR) grant.
Qualications: We seek a candidate with good knowl-
edge of ecological and evolutionary theory, analytical
capacity and good skills in English. Previous experi-
ence of eld and or experimental work is desirable. To
be accepted for the PhD program, the applicant must
have a University degree in Biology at the advanced
level (e.g. Masters) of at least 240 credits, including
at least 60 credits at the advanced level, or equivalent
knowledge. Previous degrees should also include a the-
sis of at least 30 credits at advanced level in a relevant
subject.
How to apply: The application should contain a let-
ter of intent (one to two pages that explain why you
are interested in working on this project, why you are
interested in studying for a PhD, what you hope to ac-
complish during your PhD studies, and what skills you
can bring to this project), CV, transcripts of all uni-

PhD and MSc positions in Plant Evolution in Jannice
Friedman's lab are available in the Biology Department
at Syracuse University. Our lab is using a combination28 EvolDir November 1, 2013
of ecological and genomics approaches to address ques-
tions related to the evolution of reproductive strategies
in plants. We are particularly interested in the role of
adaptation and natural selection in driving reproduc-
tive transitions like changes in pollination systems (e.g.
animal to wind) and life-history transitions (e.g. peren-
nial to annual). We use a variety of study systems to ad-
dress these questions, including the seep monkeyower
(Mimulus guttatus), ragweed and meadow-rues, and
combine genetic and genomic analyses with eld work
and greenhouse and growth chamber studies.
Graduate students in the lab can expect to have a va-
riety of projects to choose from and are encouraged to
develop their own research projects based on their sci-
entic interests. Students will also have opportunities
to attend specialized workshops and conferences across
a range of disciplines as part of their scientic develop-
ment.
Syracuse University Biology has a strong research fac-
ulty (http://biology.syr.edu/faculty/faculty.htm), as
well as a diverse and interactive group of people
interested in plant ecology and evolution (http://-
plantecology.syr.edu/). In addition, we share a cam-
pus with SUNY-College of Environmental Science and
Forestry, providing lots of opportunity for interaction.
Funding is guaranteed for up to 5 years and comprised
of a mixture of teaching and research assistantships.

research programme co-funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation (SNSF), the Swiss Confederation
and some Swiss cantons:
Grassland management: designing tomorrow's farm-
land for biodiversity (phase II)
This research programme was launched in 2010 with the
objective to develop and evaluate meadowland man-
agement practices that can maintain and/or improve
farmland biodiversity for sustaining fundamental agro-
ecosystem processes and services. The programme com-
prises two modules, one in the Swiss lowlands (Plateau)
and one in the Swiss Alps, with scientic question-
ings and hypotheses specic to these two geographi-
cally and socioeconomically distinct contexts. The suc-
cessful candidates will work either in the lowland mod-
ule, where we experimentally test, at eld scale, novel
management regimes that can restore and/or improve
biodiversity in extensively managed meadows declared
under the Swiss agri-environment scheme (AES), or in
the mountain module that carries out experiments, at
site scale, about the eects of fertilization and aerial32 EvolDir November 1, 2013
irrigation upon hay meadows, with the double objec-
tive to maintain sustainable agricultural production
and biodiversity-rich and fully functional ecosystems.
The ultimate over-arching goal of the programme is
to deliver innovative, evidence-based grassland man-
agement recommendations for developing sustainable,
biodiversity-friendly agri-environment policies. Can-
didates must have a MSc degree and a strong inter-
est for agro-ecological issues. They must master mod-
ern analytical techniques and software. Knowledge of
grassland indicator taxa would be advantageous. Good
knowledge of spoken and written English is prerequi-
site, while knowledge of German and French would be
a plus, notably for communicating with farmers. Start:
February-March 2014. Salary according to SNSF con-
ditions. The successful candidates are also expected to
take part to teaching and minor administrative duties.

PolyploidyAndImmunity
Closing date 13th November Ancient whole genome du-
plications (WGDs) and the additional genetic resources
resulting from them have played major roles in the evo-
lution many eukaryotes. In vertebrates, there is strong
evidence that two rounds of ancient WGD were fol-
lowed by a third additional WGD in the teleost shes -
the sh specic genome duplication (FSGD). The role
that WGD plays in the evolutionary success of recipi-
ent taxa and lineages has been hotly debated for many
decades. However, while progress has been made in
understanding the origins and mechanisms of the for-mation of polyploids in many groups, less attention has
been devoted to the advantages and/or disadvantages
of being a polyploid.
This PhD project will investigate two related facets of
individual tness - immune gene diversity (the MHC)
and macroparasite burden, in a group of neotropi-
cal catshes (the Corydoradinae) that have undergone
multiple WGDs, ranging from ancient paleopolyploid
events ( ~40 mya) to relatively recent duplications ( ~1-2
mya). The Corydoradinae are widely over South Amer-
ica and comprise more than 170 described species di-
vided into 9 lineages.
The group demonstrate multiple genome duplication
events (polyploidy) and also exhibit complex mimetic
colour pattern relationships1. Using sympatric commu-
nities of species (which should theoretically be exposed
to the same parasites) that vary in ploidy level, this
project will: 1) use next generation sequencing to quan-
tify MHC diversity in taxa that range from diploid to
potentially 16x ploid; (2) quantify macroparasite bur-
dens in multiple sympatric communities consisting of
diploid and polyploid species (3) investigate the role
of additional host-specic factors that may inuence
macroparasite burdens such as size, age, diet and pop-
ulation demographics.
The successful applicant join the group of Dr Martin
Taylor who has recently moved to UEA (see 2) and will
receive training in next generation sequencing and asso-
ciated bioinformatic analysis as well as more traditional
techniques such as parasitology. There will also be op-
portunities for conducting eldwork in South America
with Brazilian collaborators.
Entry Requirements: 2.1 in the subject are of Biological
Sciences.
Start date: January 2014.
Funding Notes:
This is a 3 year University funded studentship open to
EU applicants only and will cover tuitiion fees as well
as providing an annual stipend of $13,726 and some
funds towards research costs.

EvolutionaryGenomics
Ph.D. position in ecological & evolutionary genomics
Coupling genomics with experiments to study
divergence-with-gene-ow in trees A Ph.D. student
position is available in the lab of Christian Lexer at
University of Fribourg, Switzerland. We are looking
for a highly motivated candidate with a keen interest
in evolutionary and speciation genomics and prior ex-
perience with / exposure to key methodologies relevant
to this eld. The post is funded by a 3-year project
grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation.
The Ph.D. project will address key questions related to
the ecological & evolutionary genomics of 'divergence-
with-gene-ow' in Populus alba and P. tremula, two
wide-spread Eurasian tree species related to Populus
trichocarpa, the rst completely sequenced forest tree.
Possible study topics include (1) assessing the roles
of early vs. late-acting reproductive barriers in the
maintenance of species boundaries with genomic tools,
(2) inferring the genomic architecture and selective
value of species dierences maintained in the face of
gene ow, (3) testing the role of meiotic drive and
other early post-mating barriers in species isolation.
You will address these topics using high-throughput
'genotyping-by-sequencing' approaches in experimental
populations. Depending on your interests, you may also
participate in eld collections in Europe and/or Asia
and subsequent whole genome resequencing of natural
populations, addressing dened questions on the ge-
nomics of the divergence continuum in this group. Prior
experience with the use of DNA-based genetic markers
to answer evolutionary questions is essential for this
project. Also essential is a keen interest in gaining ex-
perience with the analysis of (ultra-) high throughput
DNA sequencing data. Considerable expertise in bioin-
formatics and computational biology is available locally34 EvolDir November 1, 2013
in the department, from the Swiss Institute of Bioin-
formatics, and from Swiss Ph.D. programs to facilitate
rst-year training.
The starting date is negotiable (from March 2014 on-
wards). Funding is available for at least three years.
Knowledge of French or German is helpful in every day
life, but the working language in the group is English.
A Master or diploma degree in biology or related sub-
ject is required. Fribourg is a lively town with pleasant
surroundings and an excellent quality of life. It is lo-
cated ca. 30 minutes from the Alps, close to other cities
such as Berne and Lausanne and just a little over an
hour from Geneva and Z urich.
To apply, please send an e-mail with the application
materials in a single pdf le to Christian Lexer (chris-

UGlasgow CichlidEvolution
Exciting opportunities exist at the University of Glas-
gow to investigate the genetic and developmental basis
of adaptive morphological divergence. Specically, us-
ing the dramatic adaptive radiation of Malawi cichlids,
the genetic basis of continuous and complex craniofa-
cial phenotypes will be examined from a number of per-
spectives. The speed at which this evolutionary radia-
tion has occurred means that closely related species ex-
hibiting dierent phenotypes can be readily compared.
Many species are available for experiments and a newly
renovated state of the art facility for rearing cichlids
exists on the Glasgow campus. A student would form a
project that will take advantage of an interdisciplinary
supervisory team which includes Dr. Quentin Fogg
(Anatomy), Prof. Elizabeth Tanner (Biomedical Engi-
neering), and spans basic evolutionary biology, develop-
ment, genetics, anatomy, and engineering. Therefore,
this project will involve a broad range of training andwe seek an enthusiastic student with a willingness to
learn techniques and theoretical principles from a wide
range of elds. Opportunities for travel to other labs
will exist with collaborators (Dr. R. Craig Albertson)
at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA.
Applicants will normally be expected to reside (or have
residency) within the UK. EU nationals will have to
demonstrate that they have spent the three years prior
to application resident in the UK (this can include res-
idence whilst undertaking undergraduate study). Ap-
plicants should have obtained, or expect to obtain a 2:1
or 1st Class Honours degree in a relevant subject. The
nancial package will include a 3.5 year stipend, ap-
proved University of Glasgow fees, Research Training
Support Grant (RTSG) and a conference allowance.
Interested students should contact Dr. Kevin Parsons
(Kevin.Parsons@glasgow.ac.uk) and eventually be pre-
pared to provide a CV, two references, and other sup-
porting degree documents. Applications will begin to
reviewed on December 16th 2013. This project would
be funding by the MRC for a duration of 3.5 years.

The genetic basis of behavioral \handedness" in scale-
eating cichlid sh Left-right (L-R) asymmetry in mor-
phology or handedness in behavior is well-known from
several groups of animals. The scale-eating cichlid sh,
Perissodus microlepis, from Lake Tanganyika, Africa,
exhibits a strikingly asymmetry in their heads that are
either left-bending or right-bending and serve to attack
their victim sh from either only their right or left sides.
This remarkable dimorphism in these sh made them a
famous textbook example of extreme ecological special-
ization and for negative frequency-dependent selection
as 50% of the population are L and the other 50% are
R.
This special adaptation is one of the research ar-

We are looking for a PhD student who is interested in
genetic [e.g. QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) mapping]
and population genomic [e.g. RAD-seq (Restriction

UManchester MarineAdaptation
PhD position: Eects of climate change on marine in-
vertebrates - University of Manchester
Advisors: Tucker Gilman, John Fitzpatrick, Richard
Preziosi, Ceri Lewis (Univ. of Exeter)
Start date: September 2014
Project description: Human activities are changing the
Earth's climate and the Earth's oceans. Air and water
temperatures are increasing, and the uptake of CO2
into seawater is causing oceans to become more acidic.
These changes are expected to be detrimental to ma-
rine invertebrates, a diverse group of species (e.g., sea
urchins, corals, clams) that are often keystones in their
ecosystems. Most marine invertebrates release their
sperm and eggs directly into the water, where gametes
meet and fertilization takes place. There is growing ev-
idence that environmental change can impair gamete
function and the fertilization process. However, how
these climate-mediated changes in marine invertebrate
reproduction will drive evolution and aect population
persistence and ecosystem stability is dicult to intuit.
Mathematical models are urgently needed but do not
exist.
In this project, the student will combine mathematical
and computational modelling with empirical testing to
understand how climate change aects marine inverte-
brates and the ecosystems they support. With guidance
from Tucker Gilman and Richard Preziosi, the student
will develop advanced analytical models and individual-
based simulations of marine ecosystems. With guidance
from John Fitzpatrick and Ceri Lewis, the student will
test the model predictions in vivo. This work will take
advantage of the University of Manchester's Computa-
tional Shared Facility and of the University of Exeter's
Aquatic Resource Centre. Students with backgrounds38 EvolDir November 1, 2013
in life sciences, physics, mathematics, or computer sci-
ence would be well-suited for this project.

2 PhD positions in forest tree responses to climate
change
University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sci-
ence Appalachian Laboratory, Frostburg, MD
Applications are invited for two NSF-funded PhD stu-
dent assistantships at the University of Maryland Cen-
ter for Environmental Science, Appalachian Laboratory
(AL). We are seeking self-motivated students interested
in working on tree responses to climate change using (1)
macroecological modeling and remote sensing (Position
1), and (2) ecological genomics (Position 2). Students
will join an interactive and growing team of ecologists
and geneticists at AL working on understanding the
responses of forest trees to climate variability.
Position 1: Macroecological modeling and remote sens-
ing The main project for this student is to combine
macroecological approaches and remote sensing to link
intraspecic variation (genetic composition, phenology,
functional traits, etc) and environmental gradients at
geographic scales, with an emphasis on understanding
the response of forest trees to climate change. The
student will help extend existing approaches in dis-
tribution modeling (e.g., species distribution models,
community-level models) to model and map intraspe-
cic variation at regional to continental scales and
identify the geographic regions containing populations
pre/mal-adapted to future climate change. Within this
framework, there are numerous opportunities for a stu-
dent to extend the broader project objectives. This is
an ideal project for an individual interested in macroe-
cology, remote sensing, and species distribution model-
ing. Candidates should have some experience with GISand statistical analyses implemented in R.
Position 2: Ecological genomics The focus of this stu-
dent will be identifying the genomic basis of ecologically
important traits involved in adaptation of forest trees to
climate, especially along the southern range edge where
growing seasons are early and long. This project will in-
volve integrating next-generation sequencing with phys-
iological traits and climate data to search for genotype-
phenotype and genotype-environment associations in-
dicative of local adaptation. This is an ideal position for
students excited about using the latest genomic tech-
niques to study fundamental issues in local adaptation,
environmental change, and the eects of range limits.
Previous experience in population genetics, plant ecol-
ogy, and solid computer skills are required. Some pro-
gramming experience (Perl, R) is a plus.
Both positions are based at the Appalachian Labora-
tory in Frostburg, Maryland, working with Drs. Matt
Fitzpatrick (macroecology) and Andrew Elmore (re-
mote sensing), and Stephen Keller (genomics). The
positions come with a highly competitive stipend and
benets package, including 3 years of support on a re-
search assistantship, with additional support available
from teaching assistantships. Students will matriculate
through the Marine, Estuarine, and Environmental Sci-
ences Program (MEES) at the University of Maryland,
College Park and will reside at the Appalachian Lab-
oratory in Frostburg for the duration of the project.
Frostburg is a small college town in the mountains of
western Maryland, providing abundant outdoor recre-
ation opportunities.
For more information, contact Matt Fitz-
patrick (mtzpatrick@umces.edu) or Steve Keller
(skeller@umces.edu). To apply, please email as a
single pdf document: (1) a statement of interest, (2)

to tree grad@al.umces.edu. Please indicate in your
subject line \macroecology" or \genomics" to indicate
the position of interest. Review of applications will
begin November 1, 2013 and will continue until suitable
candidates are found, with starting dates available as
soon as January 2014 and no later than Fall semester
2014.

versity, Wildland Resources). The research will en-
tail comparisons of triploid and diploid aspen geno-
types, in controlled-climate, common-garden and eld
experiments. Traits of interest include ecophysiology,
growth capacity, and chemical ecology, and associatedresponses to abiotic (e.g., climate change) and biotic
(e.g., herbivory) stresses. Applicants may pursue ad-
mission to UW graduate programs in Forestry, Zoology,
Botany or Entomology.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a premier in-
stitution for research in ecology and evolution, and has

UtahStateU EvolutionaryBiology
The Kapheim Lab in the Department of Biology at
Utah State University will have openings for gradu-
ate students beginning in Fall 2014. Research in the
lab centers on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity,
particularly as it applies to social behavior in bees.
The lab's primary research objectives are to gain in-
sights about the mechanisms underlying variation in
social behavior, and to use these insights to investigate
the evolutionary processes governing the origins, main-
tenance, and elaboration of social behavior. Specic
projects in the lab focus on (1) the role of maternal
manipulation in the evolutionary origins of eusociality,
(2) the relationship between host-symbiont dynamics
and phenotypic plasticity (i.e. the inuence of the gut
microbiome on individual bee social behavior and vice-
versa), (3) the contribution of neutral, adaptive, and
convergent evolutionary processes in repeated origins
of eusociality, and (4) the adaptive function of reward
response in social evolution. This research is integrative
across sub-disciplines of biology, including evolutionary
biology, behavioral ecology, comparative genomics and
transcriptomics, neuroscience, physiology, and metage-
nomics. We study a variety of bee species, ranging from
solitary (e.g. alfalfa leaf-cutter bees), to those with ex-
ible social organization (e.g. tropical sweat bees), to
eusocial (e.g. bumble bees).
Graduate students will have the opportunity to develop
research projects within the themes outlined above.
This will likely involve a combination of eld, lab, and
computational work. Students who nd this opportu-
nity to be a good t will have an interest in developing
skills in a combination of these activities, as well as
an interest in bees and integrative evolutionary biol-
ogy. Graduate students will have the opportunity to
conduct eld work in Panama or in the U.S.
The USU Department of Biology is home to a superb
faculty with a diverse set of research interests that
provides training in evolutionary biology, ecology, cell
and molecular biology, neuroscience, and microbiology,
among other topics. The Logan-based USDA Bee Biol-
ogy and Systematics Laboratory is just down the road
from campus, and oers opportunity for collaborative
research with biologists studying a diverse set of ques-
tions related to bee biology. USU is located in northernUtah's Cache Valley. Situated between two mountain
ranges and next to beautiful Logan Canyon, there are
plenty of opportunities for eld work, as well as out-
door recreation in and around Logan. The Smithso-
nian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, a
potential location for eld work, hosts world-class sta
scientists, as well as thousands of international visiting
researchers, and provides several fellowship opportuni-
ties to graduate students.
Information about graduate studies at USU is
available on the Department of Biology web-
site (http://www.biology.usu.edu/htm/graduate-info/-
application-info). Accepted full-time graduate stu-
dents receive comprehensive funding packages that in-
clude stipends, tuition, and health benets in the
form of graduate research assistantships and teach-
ing assistantships. Additional funding is available
for research. Interested candidates may contact Dr.

ment of research interests, CV, and contact infor-
mation for references. To receive full considera-
tion, pre-applications (https://www.biology.usu.edu/-

The Fisher Lab is seeking a computationally-minded
molecular epidemiologist/ecologist to join a research
group investigating the evolutionary ecology of chytrid
fungi causing global amphibian extinctions. Continu-
ously funded since 2003 by the UK Natural Environ-
ment Research Council (NERC), we are investigating
the patterns and processes that are leading to disease-
driven amphibian declines by utilising population ge-
nomics, experimental ecology and eldwork. Our work
has been key to identifying the fungal lineages and
species that are emerging to cause amphibian declines,
and the vectors that are leading to the spread of these
invasive pathogens. The project will focus on the evolu-
tion of virulence in amphibian-infecting chytrids across
long- and short-timescales, genomics of the dierent lin-
eages, and will seek to identify the regions from which
these infections originate.
The projects primary objective is to investigate the spa-
tial epidemiology and molecular evolution of panzootic
amphibian chytridiomycosis by:
Characterising ancient and modern amphibian-
associated chytrids using population genomics of
ancient and contemporary DNA, Linking patterns

rapid genome-wide processes underpinning chytrid
invasion dynamics with the aim of linking shorter-term
evolutionary radiations that we see across local-scale
invasions to longer-term evolutionary processes, seen
across continents and species.
Our ultimate goal is to increase our awareness of evo-
lutionary ecology of these pathogens, and the risk that
they pose to species worldwide.
Applicants should have a PhD or equivalent in one of
the following areas: epidemiology, bioinformatics, com-
putational biology or a related quantitative discipline.
You should also be able to demonstrate strong knowl-
edge of, and interest in, pathogen epidemiology as well

(POPULATION GENETICS)
The Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences
and Technology, at the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology (NTNU) announces a vacant position
as Associate Professor in population genetics. The De-
partment has at present 21 professors, 7 associate pro-
fessors, 3 adjunct professors, 18 research scientists, 22
research technicians, 8 administrative sta, 12 postdoc
fellows, and approximately 40 research fellows.
Information about the department The main focus for
the strategy of the Department of Biology is to under-
stand biological processes of life to preserve the envi-
ronment. The Department has an interdisciplinary ap-
proach to education and research that is deeply rooted
in environmental biology, with evolutionary biology as
an important link between the dierent sub-disciplines.
The Department of Biology is the host of the Centre
for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), which is a National
Centre of Excellence funded by the Research Council of
Norway and NTNU.
Job description One focus area within the Department
is to develop integration among research groups within
the elds of evolution and ecology. As the understand-
ing of the genetics of populations and how this relates
to phenotypic variation manifested in a population dy-
namics context is pivotal for sustainable resource use
in a changing world, it denes an important research
area for several prominent groups at the Department.
This includes the interdisciplinary Centre for Biodiver-
sity Dynamics, which was recently appointed as a Cen-tre of Excellence (SFF-III) by the Norwegian Research
council.
We are searching for candidates with strong theoreti-
cal and/or empirical competence in population genetics
that can substantially strengthen our research in ecol-
ogy and evolution. The successful candidate should be
able to develop his/her own research program and col-
laborate with the dierent research groups at the De-
partment. Preference will be given to conceptually ori-
ented individuals who use theory and/or emerging tech-
nologies to quantify the mechanistic and causal con-
nections between genes, function, tness, population
dynamics and evolution.
Qualications The new faculty member will have re-
sponsibility for part of the teaching in population genet-
ics, genetics and evolutionary biology. Teaching compe-
tence in these elds is therefore required. The teaching
will be at bachelor, MSc and PhD levels, including su-
pervision of MSc and PhD projects. Emphasis will also
be placed on teaching and communication skills. Evalu-
ation of the applicant will be based on documented ma-
terial, including pedagogical training, presentation of
academic work, experience from supervision and teach-
ing of MSc and PhD candidates, as well as other related
skills. Quality and scope will be evaluated.
Academic sta that is unable to document formal ped-
agogical qualications in university-level teaching is
required to successfully complete a recognized course
that gives a pedagogical qualication in university-level
teaching within two years of taking up the appointment.
Courses are available at the University.
Applicants short-listed for the position will be invited
for interview. A demonstration of teaching ability, usu-
ally in the form of a trial lecture, is also required.
The Associate Professor will be jointly responsible for
the development of the discipline together with other
scientic sta in the department and will also partici-
pate in teaching activities, in accordance with the rele-
vant curriculum, and assist in developing the teaching
program, including advanced and postgraduate courses.
The Associate Professor will also be required to partic-
ipate in administrative work.
The Associate Professor is required to comply with reg-
ulations concerning developments within the discipline
and organizational changes at the University.
Newly employed academic stas who do not already
master a Scandinavian language are required to obtain
knowledge of Norwegian or another Scandinavian lan-
guage within three years of taking up the position. This
must be of a standard equivalent to Level Three in the
Norwegian for Foreigners courses provided by the De-66 EvolDir November 1, 2013
partment of Linguistics. Courses are available at the
University.
Payment - and working conditions The Associate Pro-
fessor will be required to take up residence in Trond-
heim or in the relative vicinity.
The appointment will be made in accordance with cur-
rent regulations

Call for Bee TranscriptData
Dear Evoldir members,
Within the context of global pollinator decline, a re-
cent focus has been the response of bees to pathogen
infection. Several studies reporting the transcriptomic
response of honey bees to pathogens and parasites have
already been published, with considerable variability
in expression patterns across studies. To reveal po-
tential genes or gene networks consistently aected by
pathogens, we are currently performing a meta-analysis
of the transcriptome response of bees to pathogens.
In order to increase the power of our analysis, we are
seeking for additional unpublished and/or non publicly
available genome-wide gene expression data sets (mi-
croarray, next-gen sequencing). Although our project
is currently focused on the Western honey bee, Apis
mellifera, we also wish to broaden our remit by consid-
ering other bee species.
If you have unpublished or soon-to-be-published results
addressing transcriptome response of bees to pathogens
or parasites, we ask you to contact us so we can explore
incorporating the data into our analyses. We seek the
original data of expression levels of bees from a control
group and from a (pathogen) treatment group, as well
as a description of the experimental work. Of course,
all contributions will be fully acknowledged.
For anyone who wants to participate, or wants fur-
ther details, please contact either Prof. Robert Paxton
(robert.paxton@zoologie.uni-halle.de), Prof. Christina
Grozinger (cmgrozinger@psu.edu) or Dr. Vincent Dou-
blet (vincent.doublet@zoologie.uni-halle.de).

Dear colleagues,
Together with Aneta Arct we are conducting meta-
analysis on the relationship between genetic similarity
of social mates and incidence of extra-pair paternity
in birds. If anyone has any relevant unpublished or in
press data, we'would be grateful if you could send it to
the email address below.
More specically, we are looking for data pertaining to
the following questions:
- Weather the genetic similarity between social mates
predicts the occurrence of extra-pair paternity in birds
(data needed: estimates of genetic similarity between
parents and EPC status for each pair) - Weather the
extra-pair young (EPY) to be more heterozygous than
within-pair young (WPY) (data needed: heterozygos-
ity of ospring and EPO status for each ospring) -
Do ospring tness (WPY vs. EPY) is predicted by
relatedness of the social parents (genetic similarity of
parents and proxies of ospring tness (survival, edg-
ing success, recruitment success, reproductive success)
If you have data could help in our analyses, we would be
greatly thankful for making them available. We are par-
ticularly interested in unpublished studies, which are
often lost to general public. Please contact us if you
have any questions or would like to share your data: or

Drosophila population samples
Dear all,
A bit of a long shot, but I was wondering if anyone has
any Drosophila (melanogaster or other species) popu-
lation samples in their freezer that were collected more
than 10 years ago. The greater the number of ies
the better and they could be stored dry or in ethanol
at below -20C. I would also be interested in any room
temp air dried \museum" population specimens of sim-
ilar ages.
Thanks!

Ecuador VolFieldAssit Parakeets
Field assistant position in a project about a cooperative
breeding parakeet in Ecuador
We are looking for a highly motivated eld assistant for
our study on the cooperative breeding system of the El
Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi). Our work focuses on
the variability in cooperation among helpers and the
factors shaping group size and the development of co-
operative breeding in this species. In addition, we are
involved in working for an ecological corridor. This cor-
ridor will connect several cloud forest patches to allow
for more genetic exchange between parakeet popula-
tions.The eldwork will take place in the Buenaventura
reserve (www.fjocotoco.org) near Pinas, southwest
Ecuador. The parakeet occurs at an elevation of 800
to 1300 and most nesting sites are only accessible by
foot. We monitor the nest boxes with video cameras
that need 12V batteries with a weight of 8 kg as a power
source. Therefore applicants should be willing and able
to perform long and exhausting daily walks with heavy
equipment across the foothills of the Andes. Further ac-
tivities include capturing parakeets with mist nets and
inside articial nest boxes, taking morphometric mea-
surements and blood samples, and eld observation of
parakeet ocks. The breeding activities of the El Oro
Parakeet coincide with the rainy season, which means
that we often have to work in the rain. Our normal
work load is about six days per week, but we need to
be exible and adjust our work to the activities of the
parakeets. The busiest time will be in February and
March.
The costs of an international ight and accommodation
at the reserve can be covered by the project; further
payment is not included. If required, a letter of rec-
ommendation can be issued for the volunteer. Please
apply only if you are able to participate in the project
for at least three months in a row between December
2013 and April 2014. Applications for a shorter period
of time may be considered only if the applicant does
not require reimbursement of travel expenses.

GBIF what can it do
I've recently been appointed Chair of the Science Com-
mittee of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF) http://www.gbif.org [1]. The committee is a
small group of people with a range of backgrounds, and
one of our roles is to advise GBIF on matters scientic
(e.g., what kinds of data GBIF should collect?, what
kinds of scientic questions should GBIF help answer?,
etc.).November 1, 2013 EvolDir 85
There have been formal surveys (see the papers
in the journal \Biodiversity Informatics" https:/-
/journals.ku.edu/index.php/jbi/issue/view/370/-
showToc ), meetings, and a \vision" statement (the
\Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook, http://-
www.biodiversityinformatics.org/ ). But there's always
the chance that these fora may miss some points of
view, so I'm keen to get feedback on what sort of things
GBIF could do to improve the way it can help people
tackle the scientic questions they are interested in.
For example, is there some fundamental limitation that
GBIF has that prevents it being useful to you? Is there
some feature/data type/geographic coverage/etc. that
could be addressed that would make it more useful?
Is there a role that GBIF should take on that it hasn't
done so? A useful analogy might be to think of the cen-
tral role GenBank plays in genomics, both as a place
to archive your data (sequences), a repository of other
people's data that you can access, and a research tool
(e.g., BLAST searches to locate similar sequences). Is
that the sort of thing you'd want from GBIF, or is it
something entirely dierent?
I'd welcome any comments, suggestions, views, etc.
You can reply to me directly, or to this email list (if
it allows discussions). I've also posted this request on
my blog, so you can comment there if you like.
I should stress that this is simply me trying to calibrate
my perception of GBIF's role with what others think.
Also, note if you have specic comments on things such
as the GBIF web site please use the feedback tab on
the site (that way it will reach the people who can do
something about it).
[1] For those unfamiliar with GBIF, its mission "is to
make the world's biodiversity data freely and openly
available via the Internet\. At present the bulk of
the data are observations of organisms (mostly mul-
ticellular eukaryotes, i.e., animals, plants and fungi)
based on either museum collections or observations of
living organisms. You can get an idea of the kind
of science that uses GBIF-hosted data from this list
of papers on Mendeley http://www.mendeley.com/-

A few years back I co-taught a course on Python for

currently have the 3rd edition which is most up to date
but has too much stu in it and is not as beginner-

Hope this helps.
I didn't speak Python before starting to teach this class
and found it fairly easy to pick up (one step ahead of
the students) but I'm an experienced programmer.

PopG SimulationTeachingProgram
JavaVersion
A new 4.0 version of PopG, our lab's one-locus popula-
tion genetics simulation program designed for teaching,
has been released. Version 4.0 no longer uses the win-
dowing systems of dierent operating systems directly.
It is now written in Java, and can run identically on any
system that has a reasonably recent version of Java in-stalled.
Mac OS X and Linux systems usually come with a ver-
sion of Java that can run PopG. Mac OS X versions 10.4
(Leopard) and earlier may not have a version of Java
capable of running it. Windows systems do not come
with Java installed, but Java can easily be installed on
them by downloading it from Oracle at www.java.com
at no cost.
PopG simulates multiple populations (up to 1,000 of
them) each of up to 10,000 individuals. The program
plots the gene frequency in each population at a two-
allele locus. It also displays the number of populations
in which the allele has been xed, and the number in
which it has been lost. A curve showing the expected
gene frequency in an innite population which has no
genetic drift is also shown. The graph showing gene
frequencies can be printed or saved as PNG or JPG
le.
The user species the population size, the tnesses of
genotypes AA, Aa, and aa, the mutation rates from A
to a and from a to A, the initial gene frequency of the
A allele, and the migration rate between populations
under an island-model scheme of migration in which
migration is symmetric among all populations. The
number of populations and the number of generations
to simulate can also be specied, and the random num-
ber seed set if needed.

Pyralid moth stocks wanted
Dear Evoldir,
I am running a masters project looking at the evolution
of the male apyrene sperm in the Lepidoptera (family
Pyralidae) so i am in need of eggs from which to rear
my own populations to study. I already have access to
Plodia interpunctella but anything else would be much
appreciated.
Thanks in advance,

Software DAMBE update
Dear Colleagues,
I have just uploaded a new version of DAMBE. It added
two functions requested by users and xed a bug in us-
ing your own codon table of highly expressed genes for
computing CAI.
1. Print big trees over many pages. Originally, DAMBE
has a function to break a tree into grids with each grid
corresponding to one regular page. It has two prob-
lems. First, it is quite dicult to trim the edges of
each page and piece them together into a big tree. Sec-
ond, it does not allow one to print to PDF format so
that one can see what the individual pages look like be-
fore sending to printer. The new function will simply
limit the tree width to one page so one only needs to
stick the pages together vertically. Also, if the PDF
driver is already available in your computer, you can
choose to print to PDF. If you have produced a very
big tree from other programs and want to print in
DAMBE, simply copy the tree in Newick format and
click 'Phylogenetics jPaste tree in tree panel'.
2. I have implemented the CVTree method by Prof.
B. Hao and his colleagues in China (Nucl. Acids Res,
2009). I did this because the CVTree web server does
not seem to take any user les to perform an anal-
ysis and because the link to the standalone program
is broken, i.e.,I can't nd any functional CVTree soft-
ware available. The method is useful for species (es-
pecially for viruses) where a good set of aligned se-
quences is often dicult to obtain. The input is a
set of fasta les each containing protein sequences of
a species (e.g., the .faa les one can retrieve from
GenBank), e.g., EcoliK12.faa, BacillusSubtilis.faa, My-
coplasmaGenetalium.faa, etc. You put all these les
in one directory and click 'Phylogenetics jCVTree' to
browse to the directory containing these .faa les. Se-
lect them all and click 'Open'. A tree will be displayed
(You may click 'Tree jIgnore branch lengths' to get a
better view of the topology). It will take some time if
you include more than one h undred bacterial species
each with thousands of protein sequences. The sim-
ply way to start is to retrieve some viral .faa les fromGenBank to try out the function.
The method works surprisingly well. I retrieved the .faa
les from E. coli and a few related species, broke each
.faa les into rst half and the last half, named the re-
sulting le Sp1A.faa and Sp1B.faa, Sp2A.faa, Sp2B.faa,
and so on, and found the two halves got clustered to-
gether. The possible biological foundation for this is
that each species contain some unique ancient peptides
that are scattered throughout the protein sequences and
serve as the proteomic ngerprint of the species. This
is of course just my speculation. I will look into it when
I have time (I am NOT trying to stake out a territory.
Anyone is welcome to investigate the issue).
3. I have xed a bug in the function that allows a
user-generated codon usage table of highly expressed
genes for computing CAI using DAMBE. You can use
DAMBE or any other program to generate a codon
usage table in text format that includes three essen-
tial columns: Codon, AA, and CodonFrequency. The
columns should have either no column header (i.e., 64
rows of codon frequency data start at the rst row) or
have the column headers in the rst row (i.e., 64 rows
of codon frequency data starts in the second row). The
simplest way to generate a codon usage table of highly
expressed genes is to use coding sequences for ribosomal
proteins (which are typically highly expressed.)
I have also xed a number of minor bugs. Please down-
load the new version at

Software Phylogenetic Likelihood
Library
Dear Community,
We have made the phylogenetic likelihood library for
rapid prototyping and development of phylogenetic
analysis programs available today.
It is available under GNU GPL at: http://-
www.libpll.org/ Among other things it has functions to
calculate and optimize likelihoods and branch lengths,November 1, 2013 EvolDir 89
parse alignments and trees as well as to conduct tree
search operations (NNIs, SPRs) on trees.
It is highly optimized and supports SSE3 as well as
AVX vector intrinsics. It can run in parallel using
PThreads on multi-core systems and MPI on massively
parallel systems.
For instance, we have already used the library, to
accelerate DPPDIV (a Bayesian program to cal-
culate divergence times) by over a factor of 100;

microMORPH grants 2
Reminder: microMORPH Training Grants
Dear Colleagues,
microMORPH is pleased to announce a funding oppor-90 EvolDir November 1, 2013
tunity for graduate students, postdoctorals, and assis-
tant professors in plant development or plant evolution.
$3,500 is available to support cross-disciplinary visits
between labs or institutions for a period of a few weeks
to an entire semester. We are particularly interested
in proposals that will add a developmental perspective
to a study of the evolution of populations or closely re-
lated species, or conversely, proposals to add a micro-
evolutionary perspective to developmental studies. The
deadline for proposals is November 1, 2013. More in-
formation about the training grants and the application
process may be found on the microMORPH website:
http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/microMORPH/-
grantsandfunding.html These internships are
supported by a ve-year grant from the National
Science Foundation entitled microMORPH: Molecular
and Organismic Research in Plant History. This
grant is part of the Research Coordination Network
(RCN) Program at NSF. The overarching goal of the
microMORPH RCN is to study speciation and the
diversication of plants by linking genes through devel-
opment to morphology, and ultimately to adaptation
and tness, within the dynamic context of natural
populations and closely related species.
If you would prefer not to receive any more emails
from me about the microMORPH RCN, please email
me back with the word3NO2in the subject line and
we will remove you from the mailing list. We will use
this list for occasional updates on funding opportunities
through the microMORPH RCN, and yearly workshops
hosted by microMORPH.

mtDNA rarefaction method answers
Dear Evoldir members, a few days ago I have posted a
question:
\Dear EvolDir members, I have a dataset consisting in
COI sequences from several catshark populations with
dierent sample size (7 <N<24). In order to obtain
comparable estimates of genetic diversity, I would like
to employ a rarefaction algorithm. Can anyone suggest
me a rarefaction method similar to those employed with
microsatellites and if there is any software performingsuch analysis on mtDNA data? "
I would like to thank all the people who have answered
me: you are great!! I have decided to use CONTRIB v.
1.02, theory is described in Petit et al., 1998.
Best regards, Michele Barbieri
here are the answers I have received:
#1 You can do it easily in R.
You just need to put your alignment into a DNAbin ob-
ject. You can then use the following script to do, one
population at a time. It would be easy to then imple-
ment something like the following script. I'll leave the
transforming the sequence data into a DNAbin object
as homework.
Good luck...
Anders.
#2 Hello,
I use HP-RARE by Kalinowski: http://-
www.montana.edu/kalinowski/Software/HPRare.htm
I hope that helps,
Violeta
#3 Hi Michele,
You could consider haplotypes as species, and use Es-
timateS to do your rarefaction.
Cheers, eric
#4 Collaps your sequences into haplo-
types and use the rarefaction calculator
at http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/jbrzusto/-
rarefact.php#Inputs Best, Patrick
#5 Hi Michele, I have used the software RAREFAC de-
veloped by Petit et al. Attached is the 'manual' with
instructions on where to download it.
Good luck! Mariana
#6 Dear Dr Barbieri,
I don't know if it could help you but I recently devel-
oped a toolbox (SPADS 1.0, for \spatial and population
analysis of DNA sequences") to perform several analy-
sis on DNA sequence datasets. Among these analyses,
there is the computation of the allelic richness (El Mou-
sadik & Petit 1996).
The program note presenting this software is currently
submitted to Molecular Ecology Resources but the soft-
ware itself is fully available (along with a detailed
manual) at this address: http://ebe.ulb.ac.be/ebe/-
SPADS.html
Like I said, I don't know if this is exactly what you areNovember 1, 2013 EvolDir 91
looking for, but do not hesitate if you have any question
regarding the use of SPADS.
Best wishes,
Simon
#7 Dear Michele
This paper introduced a method Petit RJ, El Mousadik

vation on the basis of genetic markers. Conservation

that is implemented with the application \Contrib"
I don't recall all the details right now but I've used it
in the past, eg doi: 10.11186/1741-7007-8-60
good luck,

#8 A long time ago we used a rarefaction method to
study coyote mtDNA genotype diversity, and this was
published in Genetics in 1991, attached. It may be use-
ful to your study.Best wishes, Niles
OTHER ANSWERS FROM ResearchGate:
#9 You could try the rarefraction program by Steven
Hollond, available from: http://www.uga.edu/strata/-

#10 Our colleague Yi Zhang from Beijjing uses the
Adze program for mtDNA allelic richness and said it
was very easy Johannes
#11 Also see Rarefac at http://www.pierroton.inra.fr/-
genetics/labo/Software/Rarefac/. It is designed specif-
ically for use with mtDNA datasets but also can accom-

Although at rst glance it this position may look
slightly distant from the main focus of EvolDir, we are
very keen to get applicants with strong evolutionary
background. This is a large multi-disciplinary project
and the applicant will need to be able to incorporate a
number of evolutionary processes into modelling, and
so are keen to ensure we are advertising for people with
understanding of evolutionary processes as well as eco-
logical and spatial knowledge.
Postdoctoral Fellow V Factoring adaptive capacity into
macroecological modelling under climate change
The Position: Eorts by conservation practitioners and
natural resource managers to consider potential im-
pacts of climate change in planning and management
decisions are making growing use of spatially-explicit
models of expected biological responses under future
climate scenarios. Modelling of potential shifts in the
distribution of individual species is increasingly being
augmented by macroecological modelling of potential
changes in the composition of whole communities and
high-level analyses of the of climate change (VOCC)
across entire regions and continents. One shortcoming
shared by all of these approaches is that they rarely
consider the extent to which potential climate impacts
might be moderated by the capacity of dierent organ-
isms for genetic or plastic adaptation.
A major collaboration between CSIRO, Melbourne Uni-
versity and Monash University V the Genomic Basis
for Adaptation to Climate Change (GBACC) project,with funding from the Science and Industry Endow-
ment Fund V is now shedding light on this problem
by developing a whole new approach to estimating and
inferring adaptive capacity through integration of state-
of-the-art genomic analyses with a range of other eco-
logical and evolutionary information.
This postdoctoral position will research and trial ap-
proaches to incorporating estimates and inferences of
adaptive capacity developed by this work into macroe-
cological modelling and VOCC analyses informing pol-
icy, planning and management responses to climate
change across Australia. The position will be based
in a leading biodiversity modelling team in CSIRO, and
will contribute to delivering adaptation solutions to end
users through CSIROs Climate Adaptation Flagship.
Location: Canberra, ACT, Australia Salary: $81K -

Applications are invited for a three-year OCE Post-
doctoral Fellowship in quantitative genetics/genomics
of fruit ies. The Tephritidae fruit y family includes
some of the major pests of cultivated eshy fruits in
tropical and temperate regions of the world. In Aus-
tralia this includes Bactrocera tryoni, B. neohumeralis
and B. jarvisi, three species that dier in their distribu-
tion, stress tolerance and host rank preference. Further,
these species produce fertile hybrids in the laboratory,
thereby oering unique experimental strategies. The
successful candidate will pursue a genetic dissection of
fruit y natural history traits as part of a research team
working more broadly on the molecular biology of Bac-
trocera species, including full genome sequencing, com-
parative genomics, RNAi, and gene expression.
Therefore, we are looking for a high-calibre, creative
researcher who, under the supervision of more senior
scientists, will build and lead the quantitative genetics
component of the project. Strong candidates will be
those who can complement the team with strong sta-
tistical skills and genetic analysis experience, preferably
also with molecular biology experience.
The Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for:
* Designing and conducting laboratory bioassays and
common garden experiments to determine whether in-
trogression can change reproductive performance un-
der conditions favouring traits from one species over
another.
* Guided by full-genome sequence, identifying regions
of recombination that are preferentially introgressed in
hybrid lines under dierent conditions.* Undertaking molecular characterisation of the most
promising candidate loci using RNAi.
* Working with other team members and providing sup-
port and/or supervision of junior sta or students, etc.
* Producing high quality scientic and technical out-
puts including journal articles, conference papers and
presentations, patents and technical reports.
* Developing innovative concepts and ideas for further
research.
* Regularly reviewing relevant literature and patents.
* Contributing to the eective functioning of the re-
search team and helping to deliver on CSIRO's organi-
sational objectives.

3Djj&id=3D83476 Job Description This 3-year PDRA
position starting January 6, 2014 is one of ve re-
search posts linked to the recently awarded AHRC
project entitled: Cultural and Scientic Perceptions of
Human-Chicken Interactions funded by the Arts and
Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Science and
Culture Large Grant Scheme.
This collaborative project between eight researchers at
the Universities of Bournemouth, Leicester, Notting-
ham, York, Roehampton and Durham, will explore the
natural and cultural history of chickens, the most glob-
ally ubiquitous domestic animal.
To elucidate the circumstances and meaning of the
westward spread of chickens from their origins in
Southeast Asia to Europe and the Americas (from
the late prehistoric period to the present), our multi-disciplinary team of archaeologists, anthropologists, ge-
neticists, and zooarchaeologists will integrate the evi-
dence from across their elds to address the following
questions:
1) When, how and why did domestication and the
early husbandry of chicken take place? 2) How rapidly
did chickens spread into dierent parts of Europe and
how was this diusion linked to population movements,
trade or cultural changes? 3) When did poultry and egg
production emerge and how intensively were chickens
exploited for these products in dierent regions and pe-
riods? 4) When and where did modern chicken breeds
develop? 5) How have chickens changed society and cul-
ture in antiquity and in modern times? 6) Can evidence
from the past be used to transform modern practices of
chicken management?
The Durham-based genetics PDRA will focus primar-
ily on the extraction and amplication of DNA from
modern and ancient chickens from a wide range of geo-
graphical and temporal contexts. The genetic sampling
and results will be informed by, and interpreted within
the context of the linked PDRA and PhD projects asso-
ciated with the overall project. Although training and
hands-on supervision will be provided, it is essential
that the candidate can operate independently and take
initiative to direct the research. The PDRA will be su-
pervised by Dr. Greger Larson and will work alongside
other members of the Durham Evolution and Ancient
DNA (DEAD) lab in the Department of Archaeology
at Durham University.
The starting salary will be $30,424 and will increase
annually over the three-year duration of the project.
The successful applicant will be provided with oce
space and computing resources and funds are available
for laboratory consumables and travel for conferences
and sample procurement.
Requirements Applicants are expected to hold a PhD
in Bioarchaeology, Anatomy, Biological Anthropology,
Zoology or other relevant subject. The PDRA will need
to demonstrate a record of both independent and col-
laborative research alongside evidence that they can de-
velop and produce their own publications and research
papers. Responsibilities
- Work in consultation with the PI and the project
team to plan and manage the programme of genetic

ETH Zurich ModellingVirology
Postdoc position in mathematical immunology and vi-
rology at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland:
A postdoctoral position is available in the group
of Roland Regoes at the ETH Zurich (see
www.tb.ethz.ch/research/Regoes). In our group
we study quantitative aspects of infectious diseases
within their hosts.
We are looking for a postdoc interested in studying the
within host dynamics of viruses and their interaction
with the immune system. Applicants for the positions
should have strong quantitative skills. We therefore
encourage people with a background in mathematics,
biostatistics, bioinformatics or physics to apply. The
starting date can be as soon as possible, but we are
fairly exible what that is concerned.The specic questions, which we would like to address
over the next years, revolve around infering the popu-
lation dynamics of the virus from high-throughput ge-
netic data. We would like to nd out what the viral
sequence data, collected in infected hosts over time,
tells us about the replication and spread of the virus
within its host. We also plan to investigate the popula-
tion dynamics of B-cells using detailed genetic data on
antibody responses.
Experience of phylogenetic and phylogeographic meth-
ods would be extremely advantageous. The research
in our group is conducted in close collaboration with
experimental groups in Switzerland and oversees.
Our group is strongly linked with the theoreti-
cal biology group of Sebastian Bonhoeer (http:/-
/www.tb.ethz.ch/research/Bonhoeer) who works on
the emergence and dynamics of drug resistance. This
means that we have common group meetings, and the
PhD student and the postdoc will be exposed to a wide
range of interesting research on infectious disease dy-
namics.
Zurich is a great place to live and to do research. It
is the home of two big universties (the University of
Zurich and the ETH), and is an attractive city in beau-
tiful surroundings with a multinational population and
many educational and recreational opportunities.

France SturgeonConservation
Post doctoral proposal on genetic monitoring of stocked
European sturgeon in the Garonne and Dordogne
Rivers (south west of France) Expected duration of
the contract: 18 months (subject to the funding ac-
ceptance)
The European sturgeon Acipenser sturio is a species
that collapsed in the 20th century. Formerly abundant
all around Europe from the Baltic Sea to the Black
Sea, there is currently still a genetically impoverished
population in the Gironde. This species is the subject
of a restoration program (captive stock and produc-
tion of juveniles for restocking). Since more than 20
years, IRSTEA (National research institute of science
and technology for environment and agriculture, near
Bordeaux) has conducted basic and applied research
to preserve the species. In particular, the experimen-
tal station at Saint Seurin Sur Isle can produce tens of
thousands of juveniles dedicated mainly for stocking to
restore the population in the wild.
It is necessary to evaluate the eectiveness of this
method of management. In particular, the dierential
survival of juveniles should be tested according to sev-
eral parameters: the stocked fry's family, the release
sites and other parameters to be discussed. To provide
some answers, a research subject trying to connect par-
ent's origin to the survival of juvenile sturgeon released
is developed. This work requires a microsatellite geno-
typing approach and the control of parentage softwares.
This program briey presented will be proposed for
funding by IRSTEA.
We are looking for an applicant who holds a PhD in
biology (genetics or molecular biology specialties). The
successful candidate will develop the methods of molec-
ular biology and chose the appropriate parentage soft-
ware amont several available ones, according to their
characteristics and applications. The primary goal is to
determine the parents of young sturgeon released into
rivers and recaptured.
Expected skills - Good practice of traditional methods
of molecular biology; - An understanding of populationNovember 1, 2013 EvolDir 99
genetics and molecular genealogy concepts; - An ease
to explore (operating principle, scope ...) and use sev-
eral statistical softwares; - Flexibility to work in mul-
tiple teams, in a molecular biology laboratory, with a
computer, in the eld; - The ability to write scientic
articles in international journals.
Project preparation will follow the following steps: -
Current October 2013: publication of the call for ap-
plications in various media - Early December ranking
of the top 3 candidates - During December: funding
demand to IRSTEA - If funding is granted, contract
will start in March 2014 - contract period 18 months
(10 months + additional 8 months conditional on the
submission of a publication after 10 months)
Environment of the postdoctoral contract can be de-
scribed as follows: Workplace: Research Unit 'Estu-
arine ecosystem and diadromous sh ' IRSTEA Ces-
tas, main contact: Marie-Laure Acolas, researcher,
marie-laure.acolas@irstea.fr, and Eric Rochard, unit

how your skills coincide with the qualications for this
position and your research motivation. Thank you to
specify your commitment to this project knowing that
we can not guarantee that the project will be funded
before February 2014 (cancellations during the process
is equivalent to failure because the evaluation for fund-

GeorgetownU PopGenetics
*Postdoc in Population Genetics and Molecular Evolu-
tion*
A postdoctoral position is available in the elds of
population genetics and molecular evolution in the
Hamilton Laboratory in the Department of Biology at
Georgetown University. The position is for one year
beginning 01 January, 2014 or thereabouts, with the
possibility to extend the length of the appointment.
We seek a collegial and highly motivated individual
with a PhD in ecology and evolution, genetics, ge-
nomics, computer science or a related eld. Experience
in evolutionary genetics, computational biology, careful
attention to detail, and rigorous data organization are
essential. Strong written and oral communication skills
are also important qualications.
The postdoctoral associate position requires back-
ground in evolutionary genetics, DNA sequence
analyses, computer scripting, familiarity with next-
generation DNA sequence data, and the ability to work
independently and be highly organized.
The postdoctoral associate will be responsible for two
primary projects. The rst project is a study compar-
ing nucleotide substitution rates in annual and peren-
nial plants in the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae)
using transcriptome DNA sequence data. The post-
doctoral associate will work collaboratively with re-
searchers at multiple institutions to estimate and com-
pare substitution rates using a range of software and
scripts to make multiple sequence alignments, estimate
substitution rates, and carry out statistical tests. The
second project seeks to identify microsatellite genetic
markers in two species using primary next-generation100 EvolDir November 1, 2013
DNA sequence data. This will require assembly of next-
generation DNA sequence reads, searching these assem-
bled sequences for repeats, designing PCR primers that
ank repeat regions, and empirical testing of the PCR
primers to determine if the loci are polymorphic. The
postdoctoral associate is also expected to develop an
additional research project in an area of mutual inter-
est and apply for funding for that project.
The position requires familiarity with computer script-
ing and programming, knowledge of methods to work
with large amounts of DNA sequence data, the use of
computer programs for tasks such as estimating phy-
logenetic trees, the ability to organize and tabulate re-
sults, as well as the ability to contribute to the writing
of manuscripts describing the results.

Post doctoral researcher (1+2 years) or PhD student
(1+3 years): Within-species variation in chemical de-
fence: trade-os, noise or alternative strategies?
The Centre of Excellence in Biological Interactions <
https://www.jyu./bioenv/en/divisions/coe-
interactions/ >funded by the Academy of Finland
calls for applications for a post doc position or a
PhD position focusing on within-species variation in
chemical defence.
Defensive toxins are widely used by animals, plants and
micro-organisms to deter natural enemies. The main-
tenance of toxin diversity both in quality and quantity
is an important ecological question that requires con-
sideration from an evolutionary perspective. The post
doc or PhD student will seek alternative evolutionary
explanations for the persistence of variation, and will
study toxin diversity by focusing on
* why some individuals lack defence in an otherwise
toxic prey population (cheating by automimicry), * why
the toxin content of individuals varies within a popu-lation and * why the chemical constituents of defence
vary.
The wood tiger moth Parasemia plantaginis will be
used as study species. A successful candidate will have
a PhD (post doc position) or masters (PhD position)
in evolutionary biology, ecology, entomology or related
discipline. She/he is motivated, enjoys problem solv-
ing, has a strong background in designing and conduct-
ing experiments, and has a record of successful publi-
cations. Experience in chemical ecology or chemistry is
a bonus but ability to work together with chemists is
essential; therefore, excellent communication skills are
required.
We oer a stimulating, creative and international work-
ing environment, modern facilities, reliable funding, ex-
cellent career prospects and nice colleagues.
Please contact johanna.mappes('at')jyu. for informal
inquiries and further particulars.
* Application deadline: 22 November 2013 * Appli-
cations should be addressed to Johanna Mappes and
emailed to johanna.mappes('at')jyu. quoting \Post-
doc/PhD" in the subject eld. Applications should
include a brief letter of motivation, CV, publication
list and contact details of two references. * Starting
date: immediately but negotiable * Salary: post doc

HybridSpeciation
Postdoc in evolutionary genetics of hybrids:
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Pl on,
Germany Postdoc position in evolutionary genetics of
hybrid sh Application deadline: October 30th 2013
The group \evolutionary genetics of shes" lead by Dr.
Arne W. Nolte at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on, Germany, is oering a 3 yearpostdoc position in evolutionary genomics of hybrid
sh. This project is nanced for ve years and there is a
possibility for an extension of up to two years. Project
start is February 2014 and the postdoc should ideally
begin work in spring 2014. The salary of the postdoc
will be according to the standard German pay scale in-
cluding all social benets (TV oD E13 salary).
The postdoc will assume a central position in our
project \EVOLMAPPING" that is funded through an
ERC starting grant. The goal of this project is to ana-
lyze evolutionary genetic processes in invasive Cottus, a
lineage of sh that represents an example for the early
steps of hybrid speciation. We will perform an exhaus-
tive search of the Cottus genome to identify genes in-
volved in evolutionary change induced through natural
hybridization. The strategy is to integrate analyses of
gene expression, genetic mapping and screens for geno-
typic selection in laboratory populations and wild sh
to identify the links between genotypic and phenotypic
evolution. Note that we are oering PhD positions
in the framework of the EVOLMAPPING project and
that the postdoc can interact with students and and
contribute to the development of their projects.
We are seeking a postdoc with skills in programming
(scripts and analysis pipelines), genetic mapping, next
generation sequence analysis and genome evolution.
The postdoc is expected to actively contribute in our
ongoing collaborations with colleagues studying pop-
ulation genomics and whole genome re-sequencing of
Gasterosteus and mice and who develop programs for
mapping new genome sequences to distantly related ref-
erence genomes. The core dataset that will be gener-
ated includes Illumina sequencing of more than 20 Cot-
tus genomes for population genomics, some of which
will be used for de novo genome assembly. The latter
will be supported by up to date approaches to facilitate
genome assembly as for example sequencing of large in-
sert libraries and RAD tag mapping of laboratory F2
crosses and natural hybrids to aid genome assembly.
The expected output of the postdoc is to contribute
to the genome assembly and to compare the genomic
makeup of invasive Cottus with their parental species.
The postdoc will be involved in fundamental research
questions on comparative genomics relating to adaptive
evolution and speciation and in comparisons between
Cottus and distant reference genomes and we highly
appreciate a creative postdoc who contributes to and
extends our research agenda to learn about evolution-
ary change in hybrid sh.
We oer an English speaking and ambitious working en-
vironment at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on, Germany. The Institutes main elds

013086
Project description To understand the causes and con-
sequences of genetic variation in seasonal timing of re-
production in great tits (Parus major) we will create
selection lines of early and late reproducing birds using
genomic selection. For this, we will genotype (using a
650k SNP chip) a large base population of wild birds
and use this to calculate genomic breeding values for thebirds in the selection experiment. The phenotypic re-
sponse to selection will be assessed both in birds housed
in controlled environment aviaries and in selection line
birds introduced to the wild, to record phenotypic re-
sponses under natural conditions. Furthermore, we aim
to identify those parts of the genome which will change
in response to selection to explore underlying functional
changes. Detailed molecular analysis will be based on
an annotation and analysis of the great tit genome as-
sembly during the initial phase of the project. The
project is funded by an Advanced Grant of the Euro-
pean Research Council (ERC) and will be carried out in
close collaboration with the Animal Breeding and Ge-
nomics Centre of Wageningen University. The success-
ful applicant will form part of a research team consisting
of a quantitative geneticist and two PhD students who
will be appointed for this project. Requirements We are
looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic person
with a PhD in molecular genetics, molecular ecology
or equivalent and with ample experience in working
with large high-throughput sequence datasets, prefer-
ably with data from wild organisms. Experience with
bioinformatics and genomic selection would be desir-
able. Anity with ecological research is a pre-requisite,
as well as the ability to work in a team.

months with the possibility of extension. The post will
begin as soon as possible after November 2013.
We are interested in the proteins that enable barnacles
to stick underwater. The project involves isolating can-
didate adhesive genes in stalked barnacle Lepas anat-
ifera using a transcriptome experiment to narrow-down
candidate adhesive genes by subtraction. We already
possess cement peptides sequenced de novo from Mass
Spectroscopy and the transcriptome will give us a com-
prehensive species-specic database to search for the
target genes. Candidate adhesion genes identied us-
ing these steps will be subjected to conrmation studies
to check the gene expression patterns are in the adhe-
sive tissues. Basic bioinformatic analyses will be carried
out to examine homology of adhesive domains across
species and work out which molecular tricks are con-
served to enable adhesion. Perhaps the most important
outcome would be the ability to use adhesive genes to
clone quantities of protein for application and testing
on surfaces (e.g. titanium, gold or bone). Providing
adhesive protein material for testing would be a ma-

This work will be a part of a project dedicated to in-
vestigate evolutionary potential in wild populations, in
collaboration between the Museum of Natural history
in Paris, and the Center for Alpine Ecology in Greno-
ble.
Impact of climate change on biodiversity will greatly
depends on populations abilities to adapt to environ-
mental changes. While biodiversity is being increas-
ingly aected by global changes, there is an urgent
need to assess which species are more at risk of ex-
tinction. This renews interest for a long lasting ques-
tion on whether patterns of genetic variance and co-
variances between life history traits (so called G ma-
trix) can be considered labile or constrained by species
niches or evolutionary history. The post-doc will work
on an important database of 17 species, combine these
data to phylogenetic data, to investigate the macro-
evolutionary stability/lability of G matrices in birds,
and how the structure (variance, integration, lines of
least resistance) evolves in relation to life-history traits,
dierent niches aspects (diet, habitat).
Analyses will be based on data from long term pedi-
gree populations and we expect a candidate with strong
skills in coding, data analyses, quantitative genetics, asNovember 1, 2013 EvolDir 109
well as a strong interest in linking micro and macro
evolutionary patterns and bridging their methods to-

is not mandatory as in English will be the working lan-
guage. The monthly salary is ~2000EUR and include
social security.

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR: Behavioral Ecology of
Social Insects
The UC Berkeley Natural History Museums and De-
partment of Environmental Science, Policy, and Man-
agement at UC-Berkeley are currently seeking a Post-
doctoral Scholar in the laboratory of Dr. Neil Tsutsui.
We are seeking a Postdoctoral Scholar to study the
behavior, genetics and chemical ecology of social in-
sects. Previous work has focused on the genetics, be-
havior, and chemical ecology of the invasive, Argentine
ant (*Linepithema humile*). In this species, genetic
changes during introduction have altered individual be-
havior and, in turn, the social organization of intro-
duced populations. These changes have contributed to
the Argentine ant's invasive success by promoting the
formation of massive \supercolonies" in the introduced
range.
The central focus of the Postdoctoral Scholar's research
will be production and perception of chemical signals
that Argentine ants use to regulate fundamental behav-
iors, including foraging, queen production, and colony-mate recognition. The Scholar will perform manipula-
tive laboratory experiments and local eld studies. The
Postdoctoral Scholar will also have an opportunity to
contribute to an ongoing collaborative study of honey
bee and bumble bee genetics and history in California,
through the Berkeley Initiative for Global Change Bi-
ology (http://globalchange.berkeley.edu).
Publications from previous research can be down-
loaded from: http://nature.berkeley.edu/tsutsuilab.
The salary range is between $39,264 - $46,092 com-
mensurate with experience; generous benets are in-
cluded (http://vspa.berkeley.edu/postdocs). The ini-
tial appointment will be for one year, with an opportu-
nity for renewal.
Minimum/Basic Qualications Required:
The minimum qualications required to be an applicant
is the completion of all degree requirements except dis-
sertation or equivalent by time of application.
Additional Qualications:
Ph.D. or equivalent completed before the appointment
and a strong background in one or more of the following
areas: behavioral ecology, chemical ecology, population
genetics, genomics, and functional genetics. Previous
experience in insect biology is desirable, but not re-
quired.
Applicants must have less than ve years of prior post-
doctoral service.
Applicants should submit to https://-

Abstract of NSF Grant:
Biologists have long hypothesized that insects and
pathogens are directly involved in the origin and
maintenance of plant diversity, especially in the ex-
traordinarily diverse tropical rainforests. The evolu-
tion of novel chemical defenses that deter insects and
pathogens has been thought to allow plants to expand
their geographic ranges, thereby promoting the forma-
tion of new species. Very little is known about the iden-
tity or distribution of the enemies that attack tropical
plants or how host-specic they are. In this research,
populations of 45 species from a common, diverse genus
of tropical rainforest trees (Protium) in Peru, Braziland French Guiana will be studied to learn about which
insects and pathogens attack the plants and how the
plants defend themselves. By simultaneously studying
natural enemies, plant defenses, and the evolutionary
history of plants, insects, and soil pathogens the inves-
tigators will gain new insights on the processes that
generate high biodive rsity in the Amazon basin. ^ a^ a
This project will train scientists both in Peru and the
United States, with a focus on promoting opportuni-
ties for students from underrepresented socioeconomic
groups. A summer eld course in Peru will be devel-
oped for Peruvian and US students at the University
of California at Berkeley, that will teach ecology, evo-
lutionary biology, taxonomy of plants and insects, ex-
perimental design and research methods. This project
will integrate research and education with international
eld biology and involve minority and socioeconom-
ically disadvantaged students. Students will be re-
cruited from an existing program at Berkeley that men-
tors rst-generation college students, providing critical
eld biology opportunities for students who are gener-
ally oered only lab-based research positions.

illingworth Brief project overview:
Pathogen evolution presents a severe threat to human
health. Through rapid adaptation, viruses such as HIV
evade immune responses and become resistant to drug
therapy. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has the po-
tential to reverse much of the progress made by modern
medicine.
Recent advances in sequencing technology provide the
ability to study the genetic diversity of pathogen pop-
ulations at a previously unprecedented resolution. Se-
quencing a population at multiple points through time,
the response of a population to selection can be un-
derstood and measured. However, new techniques are
required in order to best exploit such data.
The successful applicant will develop new compu-
tational and statistical methods for the analysis of
genome sequence data, in order to better understand
the dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogen populations.

A fully-funded 3-year postdoctoral research position is
available in the Institut f ur Panzenwissenschaften at
the Karl-Franzens-Universit at Graz, Austria.
Role Description
We seek a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher to
work on an interdisciplinary project funded by FWF.
This project takes a comprehensive approach that com-
bines phylogenetics and population genetics tools to
study evolutionary processes in a lichen species com-
plex (Pyrenodesmia). Previous work has uncovered
high levels of diversity in Pyrenodesmia in the Euro-
pean Mediterranean region, whose heterogeneous land-November 1, 2013 EvolDir 117
scape of complex geological and climatic history repre-
sents a globally signicant hot spot of biodiversity. Yet,
little is known about the inuence of local ecological
heterogeneity and environmental changes on the diver-
sity of fungi, including lichens. In this project we will
explore which processes have driven the extensive di-
versication of lichens, as a model for extremotolerant
eukaryotic microorganisms.
Applicants should have a PhD in biology or closely re-
lated eld and a strong interest in biology and evolu-
tion. Applicants shall have basic knowledge in lichen
and fungal systematics. Experience in molecular tech-
niques and phylogenetics and/or population genetics is
required. Culturing skills are advantageous, but not
essential. The post-doctoral researcher will be respon-
sible for this study on a day-to-day basis and will par-
ticipate in most aspects of the project (i.e., taxon sam-
pling, data recording, photobiont culturing, molecular
work, data analyses, paper writing).
This is a FWF funded project and it is part of an
international collaboration including associated groups
at the Institut f ur Panzenwissenschaften at the Karl-
Franzens-Universit at Graz, Austria and the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, UK. The candidate
will join the research group of Martin Grube and Hel-
mut Mayrhofer in Graz with periodic visits to Ester
Gaya at RBG, Kew.
To ask questions or apply please e-mail to:
e.gaya@kew.org or martin.grube@uni-graz.at or

Materials must be received by 1st of December 2013,
but late applications will be considered until the posi-
tion is lled.
This post is available from 1st February 2014, for a
period of 36 months, full-time.
*Applications should include:*1) letter of interest /
background (2 pages max); 2) complete CV; 3) the

CichlidHybridizationGenomics
A Postdoctoral Research Assistant (PDRA) is sought
to work on a NERC-funded genomics project with Dr
Domino Joyce.
The successful candidate will analyse a large RAD-tag
sequence data set to investigate the importance of hy-
bridization for the evolution of Lake Malawi cichlids.
Hybridization is increasingly recognised as playing a
role in the evolution of biodiversity, and although ge-
netic contributions from divergent lineages are often
detected in adaptive radiations, we currently lack evi-
dence that these contributions have been preferentially
retained through natural selection. This project aims
to reveal that functionally important genomic regions
from divergent lineages comprise the Lake Malawi ci-
chlid radiation, establishing the signicant consequence
of hybridization in the adaptive change leading to spe-
ciation
This will be an exciting career opportunity for a recent
PhD graduate, who will begin once the data has already
been collected, and benet initially from bioinformatics
training at The Genepool facility in Edinburgh. The
post holder will work with Dr Domino Joyce in the
Evolutionary Biology Group at Hull University. Ex-
pertise within the Evolutionary Biology Group encom-
passes phylogenetics, bioinformatics, behavioural ecol-
ogy, molecular evolution and population genetics. The
successful candidate will also be able to take advantage
of the University's comprehensive Sta Development
Programme.
The post holder will be responsible for the analysis of
RADseq data from a large number of haplochromine
cichlid sh, aiming to i) identify SNPs within and be-
tween species groups ii) use genome scans to identify
genomic regions under selection and iii) test for a hy-
brid origin of genomic regions. The successful applicant
will write and publish high quality peer-reviewed scien-
tic papers and will be encouraged and supported to
build on this large dataset to develop their own lines of
enquiry.
This is a xed term position for one year from the start
date.

dry valley independently or is there evidence for genetic
exchange among the insular steppe habitats of dierent
valleys? (2) What are the biogeographic connections of
steppe biota from the Alpine dry valleys with other ar-
eas of steppe vegetation in Eurasia? (3) Are phylogeo-
graphic patterns seen in steppe plants and animals con-
gruent, implying range shifts of entire communities or
rather idiosyncratic suggesting individualistic responses
to climatic oscillations? (4) Our phylogeographic ap-
proach will unravel intraspecic patterns of spatial dif-
ferentiation and temporal diversication across steppe
plant and animal lineages. These will then not only be

UOxford AdaptiveRadiations
Postdoc position in Oxford, UK: Evolutionary genetics
of adaptive radiations122 EvolDir November 1, 2013
This NERC-funded project is devoted to the analysis of
evolutionary genetic processes during speciation, with
the focus on rapid recent adaptive radiations. Such 'ex-
plosive' radiations (e.g. undergone by many genera on
Hawaii or in the Andes) can help to understand evolu-
tionary processes that were at work during the major
adaptive radiations in the history of our planet. The
conditions under which adaptive radiations occur are
not well understood and generally it is not clear why
some groups of organisms are very species-rich, while
others consist of only few species despite similar age.
This project will focus on (but not limited to) multiple
recent radiations in a plant genus Lupinus (Legumi-
nosae), which exhibits some of the highest known rates
of net diversication in plants. Such replicate radia-
tions provide powerful comparative systems to address
questions about the evolutionary forces driving episodes
of diversication.
The successful candidate will have strong interest in
speciation and adaptation processes, and signicant ex-
perience in population genetic and phylogenetic data
analysis. Previous experience with high-throughput se-
quence data analysis, programming/scripting and unix
environment will be a signicant advantage. For further
details please contact Dmitry.Filatov@plants.ox.ac.uk

SexChromosomes
Several postdoc, bioinformatician and PhD positions
are available in a collaborative project on the evolu-
tion of sex chromosomes in plants and animals. The
project is a funded by a Sinergia grant from the Swiss
National Science Foundation and brings together the
labs of Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin, Texas), Nicolas Per-
rin, and John Pannell (Lausanne, Switzerland). We are
studying the evolutionary genomics in plant and ani-
mal systems that have largely recombining sex chromo-
somes. In contrast to model systems such as mammals
and ies, these sex chromosomes are highly dynamic
parts of the genome. Our project will address ques-
tions such as: how does recombination evolve, what
drives the rapid turnover in genetic sex determining
systems, and what role does sex-antagonistic selection
play in genome evolution?
We are looking for researchers with strong backgrounds
in evolutionary genetics and/or bioinformatics. Theproject will involve tight collaboration between theory
and modeling (conducted principally in the Kirkpatrick
lab in Austin) and testing of the models using amphib-
ian (Perrin lab in Lausanne) and plant models (Pan-
nell lab in Lausanne). The collaboration will involve
travel between labs, and the empirical work in Lausanne
will be conducted by researchers working side-by-side in
groups interested broadly in the evolution of sexual sys-
tems, sex allocation, sexual dimorphism and sex chro-
mosomes. The theoretical component will involve both
modeling and statistical analyses. The empirical com-
ponents will involve eld work, crosses, the building of
genetic linkage maps, and the analysis of molecular and
genomic variation produced by NextGen sequencing of
multiple genomes and transcriptomes.
The project is funded for three years. We hope
to start empirical work by January, 2014. Informal
enquiries about empirical parts of the project can
be directed to Nicolas Perrin (nicolas.perrin@unil.ch)
and John Pannell (john.pannell@unil.ch), and about
modeling and statistical aspects to Mark Kirkpatrick

email to one of the principal investigators and should

Role Description
We seek a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher to
work on an interdisciplinary project investigating the
evolution of symbiosis. This project \Ecological drivers
of evolutionary transitions in mutualistic symbioses" is
funded by NERC to understand the ecological condi-
tions that drive the evolutionary emergence and main-
tenance of new symbioses. Mutualistic symbioses un-
derpin ecosystem functioning yet it is unclear how or
why facultative associations between previously free-
living species make major evolutionary transitions to
stable symbiosis.
The project takes an experimental evolution approach
using a synthetic photosymbiosis between a single-
celled eukaryote host and a cyanobacterium endosym-
biont. This will be combined with metabolomics, ge-
nomics and mathematical modelling to gain a holistic
understanding of both the evolutionary dynamics and
the underlying physiological mechanisms of symbiosis.
This project is an interdisciplinary collaboration be-
tween two research labs at University of York and
one at University of Sheeld. You will lead the ex-
perimental evolution and genomics components of the
project in York and collaborate closely with two other
postdoctoral researchers on the project to ensure suc-
cessful integration of the mathematical modelling and
metabolomics components. You will be responsible for
the project on a day-to-day basis and there will an op-
portunity to supervise undergraduate project students
working in the same area. You should hold a PhD in
evolutionary biology or a closely related eld. Experi-
ence of microbial experimental evolution and / or lab-
oratory experimentation with single-celled eukaryotes
would be advantageous but not essential.

action'.
Project description This project is focused on the in-
terplay between ecology and evolution. The goal of
the project is to understand the ip side of ecologi-
cal speciation. As speciation is occurring in the fo-
cal species, the food web can be modied as the focal
species changes its mechanisms of predator avoidance
or its diet. The postdoc will be involved in building
a general theoretical model that includes the within-
species diversication, the impacts on the food web, and
the feedback between the two. Collaboration with the
empirically oriented research group of Professor G oran
Englund is possible if the successful candidate is inter-
ested to model diversication in Scandinavian whitesh
populations.
Requirements To qualify for the scholarship you should
have a PhD degree in evolutionary biology, or equiva-
lent, not more than 3 years old. Knowledge of popula-
tion genetics and modelling of ecological and evolution-
ary dynamics is highly desirable. In-depth knowledge
of an empirical system tting the project description
would also be an asset. >From the successful candi-
date, we expect a documented capability of coopera-
tive scientic research work and skills in writing scien-
tic publications in English. International applicants

Dear colleagues,
This course could be of interest for some of the list
members:
- STUDYING ONTOGENY AT DIFFERENT LEV-
ELS USING GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS -
Second edition; May 26-28, 2014. Instructor:
Dr. Kieran McNulty ((University of Minnesota,
USA). Website: http://www.transmittingscience.org/-
courses/gm/ontogeny-and-gm/ This course will give
emphasis on using Geometric Morphometrics to address
questions related to growth, development, and evolu-
tion. Simple characterizations of multivariate ontogeny
will give way to more complicated methods for visual-
izing and comparing dierent patterns of growth and
development. From here, we will take up the idea of
changes in ontogeny as a mechanism for producing evo-
lutionary change. We will end by discussing the dicul-
ties and misconceptions in interpreting morphometric
analyses of ontogeny, and introduce some of the ad-
vanced topics in ontogeny that morphometricians are
beginning to address.
This course will be held in Els Hostalets de Pierola,
Barcelona (Spain) and is co-organized by Trans-
mitting Science, the Institut Catal a de Paleontolo-

The current course will present an overview of systems
biology with emphasis on the necessity, uses and pit-
falls of dynamical modelling in biology. It introduces
the required language and philosophy for a smooth and
fruitful collaboration between life scientists and the-
oreticians (i.e. mathematicians, physicists, computer
scientists). The main goal of the course is not a de-
tailed description of the modelling tools in systems bi-
ology, but a thorough overview of the terminology and
applicability range of these methodologies. The time
dedication throughout the course will be one third for
theoretical introduction, and two thirds for modelling
applications for very diverse biological systems. The
participants will acquire the necessary skills to under-

\Landscape genetics in transition to landscape ge-
nomics" WHEN: 3 - 9 November 2013
Landscape genomics is an exciting and rapidly grow-
ing discipline that combines genome-wide patterns of
genetic variation, large environmental data sets and
spatial statistical methods, to improve our understand-
ing of both species ecology and ecological adaptation.
This autumn school aims to provide an updated dis-November 1, 2013 EvolDir 131
cussion of landscape genetics analysis in the new ge-
nomic era, guided by experts in genomics, spatial sta-
tistical analyses, and population genetics. It will in-
clude an assortment of conceptual, methodological and
applied contributions, followed by hands-on training in
order to provide an overview of novel approaches for
analysing the environmental context of genomic varia-
tion. The autumn school is aimed at early-career re-
searchers (PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and
faculty who wish to gain training in this area) who have
some background knowledge in population genetics and
landscape genetics but who have an interest in improv-
ing their skills with regards to the analysis of the en-
vironmental context of genome-wide genetic variation
obtained from novel NGS data. The autumn school will
have a limited number of participants (30) and lectures
(ca. 5).
Aim and Objectives This autumn school will provide
an excellent opportunity to introduce young scientists
(PhD students and postdocs) to the complex eld of
landscape genomics and familiarise them with the ap-
plication of novel analyses from dierent disciplines
that merge within this novel eld. The specic ob-
jectives of this workshop are: 1) Promote better un-
derstanding links between the novel genomic informa-
tion and spatially explicit analysis, in order to facilitate
interdisciplinary communication and education in the
new emerging eld of landscape genomics 2) Provide
an update of the current state of the landscape genetics
eld and the major challenges and opportunities by the
incorporation NGS data. 3) Explore recent analytical
advances in NGS of non-model species and gain expe-
rience about data collection, production and analysis
strategies in population genomics. 4) Provide hands-on
training for analysing the environmental context of ge-
netic (neutral and adaptive) variation through spatial
statistic and simulation modelling using the most recent
methods on landscape genetics/genomics. 5) Address
current research challenges and explore new opportuni-
ties to improve future landscape genomics applications,
and positively contribute to the future growth of this
promising eld.

based research in and around reefs and their organisms.
I feel the EvolDir would be useful in getting this course
out to those who may be interested
Regards
Mike Sweet
We are pleased to announce dates for the 2014,
10 day eld course based at the new marine re-
search station in the Maldives - Korallion Laboratory
(www.korallionlab.com).
Based on Vavvaru Island, Lhaviyani Atoll, in the Indian
Ocean, Korallionlab oers many dierent reef habitats
for potential research projects: from tracts of reef with~100% coral cover, patch reefs within the sandy lagoon
and large coral bommies, which are often frequented by
manta rays and whale sharks. There is a purpose built
wet lab on sight for tank based experiments which has
sea water ow through and a dry lab adjacent, kitted
out with state of the art research equipment. The main
reef can be easily reached by snorkeling and diving is
not essential for your work during the course and there-
fore not oered as part of this course. Next year we will
be running two courses the rst of which runs between
April 11th-20th 2014 and the second August 22rd-1st
September 2014. This course is designed to provide stu-
dents of any level with a sound foundation in ecological
concepts, survey techniques and experimental design
in eld research applied to coral reef ecosystems. The
Maldives, an atoll country has been described as one
of the most interesting and diverse reef formations in
all of the Indian Ocean. During the course we will pro-
vide a brief introduction on coral ecology, focusing on
corals, sponges, echinoderms, reef sh and other organ-
isms. We will cover lecturers on coral anatomy, physi-
ology and ecological requirements. We will also assess
the roles o these organisms on the reef and cover ways
the reefs are being impacted by both antrophogenic and
natural factors. Reef health sampling techniques will be
discussed and practiced in the eld and we will go over
numerous experimental designs and sampling schemes
aimed at describing the reef community and reef health
status as a whole. During the latter end of the week,
each student will be expected to prepare a brief, orig-
inal project in consultation with instructors. Projects
may be suggested by observations made during group
exercises or from the class lectures, and will be eval-
uated on the basis of feasibility in the available time,
experimental design and concept. During the nal two
days of the course, data analysis will be carried out and
students will present their results orally in an end-of-
course symposium. The course costs $1500 which cov-
ers all food and accommodation, however ights (both
international and internal) are not included but we can
assist with booking. For more information please don't

description* The sequence of a genome alone does
not carry enough information to fully understand how
genomic processes are carried out in the cell nucleus;
to achieve this, the knowledge of the three-dimensional
(3D) architecture of a genome is necessary. Advances
in genomic technologies and the development of new
analytical methods, such as 3C-based methods, have
allowed getting insights at unprecedented resolution
into how the genome is organized. Recently, it has
been shown that chromatin is organized in Topologi-
cally Associating Domains (TADs), large interaction
domains that appear to be conserved among dierent
cell types. In this course, participants will learn
to use TADBit, a software for the analysis and 3D
modeling of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs)
and genomes. TADBit is based on a computational
module of the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP,
http://www.integrativemodeling.org) that uses chro-
mosome conformation capture data to determine
the 3D architecture of genomic domains and entire
genomes at unprecedented resolutions. Participants
can bring-in specic biological questions and/or their
on data to work on during the course.
*Target Audience* The course is oriented to experi-
mental researchers with minimal computational skills,
at the graduate and post-graduate levels. It is also
suitable for bioinformatics developers at all levels. We
anticipate that this course is attended by people with
several types of interests in genome organization. It
is likely that they may also aim at getting involved in
generating Hi-C data for chromosome structure deter-
mination and that they want to model its 3D represen-
tation, but that does not need to be the case for all
the participants: they may, for example, just want to
explore publicly available data.

Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the International Sympo-
sium 'Ecology & Evolution of Marine Parasites and Dis-November 1, 2013 EvolDir 137
eases' which will take place at the NIOZ Royal Nether-
lands Institute for Sea Research on Texel in the Nether-
lands from 10-14 March 2014.
The budding elds of marine ecological and evolution-
ary parasitology lack a platform that fosters the ex-
change among the divergent questions and approaches
taken to understand the role of parasitism and disease
in marine ecosystems. This symposium intends to ll
this void with the aim to:
- collect and synthesise our current knowledge on ma-
rine parasites and diseases. - facilitate the exchange of
ideas and collaborations among researchers from dier-
ent elds. - identify important future research avenues.
We are delighted to announce that the following in-
vited speakers have conrmed to join the symposium:
Robert Poulin (University of Otago, NZ), Mark Bert-
ness (Brown University, USA), Kevin Laerty (USGS
& UC Santa Barbara, USA), Corina Brussard (NIOZ
& University of Amsterdam, NL), Carolyn Friedman
(University of Washington, USA), David Marcogliese
(Environment Canada, CA).
Themes of the symposium:
- Biogeography and macroecology - Phylogeography
and population genetics - Local adaptation and co-
evolutionary dynamics - Direct and indirect eects of
diseases on marine populations and communities - Par-
asites in marine food webs and eects on ecosystem
functioning - Drivers of epidemics and emerging dis-
eases - Diseases in marine reserves and in marine con-
servation eorts
Please nd a pdf yer of the symposium attached
to this E-mail which you are kindly asked to dis-
tribute to others who might interested in the sym-
posium. For further information and registration got

UCalifornia Merced ESLwriting
Writing workshops for beginning writers and writerswho speak English as a second language (ESL) at Uni-
versity of California, Merced.
In the summer of 2014, Dr. Miriam Barlow will be
teaching online and on site week long academic writ-
ing workshops focused on helping beginning writers and
ESL students prepare scientic results for publication
in a peer reviewed journal. This workshop will be par-
ticularly useful for evolutionary biologists particularly
those who are writing about phylogenetics, and popu-
lation genetics, but other topics are welcome.
Dr. Barlow, has hosted numerous ESL students (in-
cluding undergraduates) in her laboratory and has
taught them how to prepare their work for publication.
She has successfully worked with ESL lab personnel (in-
cluding undergraduates) to prepare and publish numer-
ous manuscripts, written primarily by the non-native
speaker.
Merced is located in the heart of California's Central
Valley Region. The students at the University of Cal-
ifornia, Merced are 90% rst generation college atten-
dees, many of whom come from bilingual homes or who
speak English as a second language.

URegensburg EvolutionaryqPCR
Dec5-6
2-day qPCR course 5th-6th December 2013, University
of Regensburg, Germany.
COURSE CONTENTS: . Entire qPCR workow cov-
ered in two days . Focus on gene expression (includ-
ing microRNA) . Theoretical background and practical
hands-on data-analysis . Complemented with training
on Biogazelles qbase+ software . Focus on experiment
design and data-analysis . Attention for validation and
quality control
FIVE GOOD REASONS TO ATTEND: 1- Through-
out the course the trainers explain how quality control
at each step in the qPCR workow ensures accurate
results.
2- A reliable qPCR study begins with good experiment
design. On the rst day of the course the principles138 EvolDir November 1, 2013
of experiment design are complemented with practical
exercises.
3- Normalization using a non-validated housekeeping
gene may lead to errors more than 3-fold in 25% of the
experiments. To avoid such errors, the students learn
how to determine which and how many reference genes
to use.
4- Statistical analysis of qPCR results remains a bottle-
neck for many researchers. The course covers descrip-
tive statistics to summarize qPCR results; key guide-
lines are provided to facilitate the selection of appro-
priate statistical tests.
5- Biogazelles qPCR course allows the students to mas-
ter the MIQE guidelines and publish their qPCR resultsaccordingly.
WHAT YOU GET: Interactive training by Biogazelles
qPCR experts with proven track record, a 2-month pre-
mium qbase+ license and a package of references and
course notes on qPCR design and analysis.
TARGET AUDIENCE: The course is intended for all
qPCR users with a basic level of experience.
COST: 300 EUR for 2 days. 20 places are available.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. AlthoughNovember 1, 2013 EvolDir 139
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
