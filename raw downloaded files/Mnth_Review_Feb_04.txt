Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running se ries of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression mi-
croarrays. These immense data resources, and the un-
derlying complexities of molecular and cell biology, pro-
vide exciting research opportunitities for numerate sci-
entists.
With typically around 60-80 participants from math-
ematics, statistics, computer science, bioinformatics,
biology and related ﬁelds, the MASAMB meetings
provide an intimate setting for exchange of ideas in
methodological and applied research. Research stu-
dents and scientists newly entering the ﬁeld of genomic
research are particularly welcome.
The meeting will contain approximately 12 half-hour
talks selected from participants’ submissions, plus aposter session.
The cost of attendance at the meeting, including dinner
on the Monday evening, will be:
£120 (full residential) or £90 (without accommoda-
tion),

Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor, Maine
This meeting provides a forum for researchers and stu-
dents who work in areas of neurobiology that impact
directly upon or use the laboratory mouse as a genetic
model system. The laboratory mouse is widely con-
sidered the premiere experimental organism for genetic
studies that have implications, often direct, for human
neurological disorders. The Fifth workshop continues
the tradition of bringing students and established inves-
tigators with varying expertise and experience together
to discuss their research ﬁndings, identify areas of com-
mon research interest and develop future directions.
Session Topics: Complex traits of neurological disease
Mouse mutant resources and mutagenesis programs Ge-
netic mediation of pain Reverse and forward genetics
approaches to mouse models of eye disease Mouse mod-
els of human genetic diseases: matches and misses Pro-
tein misfolding in neurodegenerative disease

Meeting : “Evolutionary ecology of host-parasite rela-
tionships” Roscoﬀ (France), September 4-8, 2004
The Department of Life Sciences of the French C.N.R.S.
(Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque) orga-
nizes a series of meetings entitled the “Jacques Monod
Conferences” each year, on topics involving the status
of recent progress in the diﬀerent ﬁelds within funda-
mental biology and their applications to biotechnology,
health or agronomy.
We are please to advertise for a conference in 2004 on
“Evolutionary ecology of host-parasite relationships”.
This conference will held at Roscoﬀ, France on Septem-
ber 4-8, 2004.
The goal of this conference is to stress innovative re-
searches in 3 main topics: on the diﬀerent ways para-
sites exploit their hosts; on the epidemiology and pop-
ulation genetics of parasitic infections; on the evolution
of virulence, resistance and host immunity. In all cases,we will try to bridge the gap between theory and em-
pirical works.

PlantInvasiveness
I am seeking undergraduates interested in pursuing
graduate studies at the Masters level. The goal of this
NSF-funded project is to study the ecological and ge-
netic basis of invasiveness in plants. The research in-
volves a collaboration with Doug Taylor (University of
Virginia) and uses a combination of approaches (e.g.
molecular phylogenetics, ﬁeld work) for exploring the
biology of Silene latifolia in both its native (Europe)
and introduced (North America) ranges. The Depart-
ment of Biology ( http://www.bio.gasou.edu ) at Geor-
gia Southern University has active graduate and re-
search programs in ecology and evolutionary biology.
The university is located in Statesboro, a pleasant
city of 25,000 and only 45 minutes from the beachesFebruary 1, 2004 EvolDir 11
of Savannah. And while many are shoveling snow
today in various corners of North America, the daf-
fodils are blooming in Statesboro! So please pass

ticipation in the Young Scientists Summer Program
(YSSP), hosted - from June 1 to August 31, 2004 - by
the International Institute for Applied Systems Anal-
ysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria. Training is based
on close interaction with the advising senior scientists,
and typically leads to a publication in an international
journal, and, where applicable, to a chapter in a candi-
date’s Ph.D. thesis. In general, IIASA’s summer pro-
gram oﬀers exceptional opportunities for acquiring ex-
perience in an international research environment. The
Institute is located in the former summer palace of the
Habsburgs, ca. 10 km south of Vienna.
Young scientists from Austria, China, Egypt, Esto-
nia, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Nor-
way, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and the USA are eligible
for personal stipends providing full funding. For stu-
dents from other countries, travel and accommodation
stipends can be arranged on a case-by-case basis.
While successful applicants will usually pursue a
Ph.D. program at their home institutions, excep-
tions for master students and young postdocs are
certainly possible. Projects relating to any of the
nine areas described under “Research Activities” on
www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/ADN are eligible. Chances
of success are increased when candidates informally dis-cuss, prior to their application, speciﬁc research inter-
ests and plans with the project leader of the Adap-
tive Dynamics Network, Dr Ulf Dieckmann (dieck-
mann@iiasa.ac.at).

rately reconstruct the history of each species and its
interaction with the human host, and to characterise
the dynamics of transmission. The appointee will de-
velop novel mathematical and statistical methods for
analyzing patterns of spatial variation, which, depend-
ing on the species in question, reﬂect evolutionary pro-
cesses taking place on timescales of weeks, years or even
millennia. As well as addressing challenging method-
ological issues, an important goal of the research is to
develop practical methods of data analysis, with theFebruary 1, 2004 EvolDir 13
goal of informing public health interventions.

lation, speciation, phylogenetic radiation) and several
fundamental ecological processes (adaptation, ecologi-
cal specialization, symbiosis, social interactions).
Our group occupies a new (2002) building complete
with DNA sequencing facility, abundant environmen-
tally controlled rooms, and an adjoining state-of-the-art
greenhouse. Vanderbilt researchers enjoy the participa-
tion of excellent undergraduates and the resources of a
thriving medical center on a beautiful campus in the

AMOVA question
Happy New Year! I have a question about analysis of
molecular variance based on microsatellite data.
We are working on the analysis of a microsatellite data
set collected from diﬀerent populations of a eusocial
sweat bee in southern Greece. Eventually, the analy-
sis will also include specimens from other parts of the
Mediterranean. We would like to do an analysis of
molecular variance aimed at partitioning out the ge-
netic variance at the following levels:
1. among countries (e.g. France vs Germany vs Greece)
2. among regions within these countries 3. among sub-
populations within regions 4. among families within
subpopulations 5. among individuals within families
The problem is that as far as I can tell, available mod-
els for AMOVA only can be used for a sampling pro-
tocol with three levels (e.g. individuals randomly sam-
pled from diﬀerent subpopulations within populations).
For instance, this is how Arlequin treats data. I have
searched various databases and inquired of various au-
thors to ﬁnd out if AMOVA models have been derived
for data sets like outs, but have found none.
My question is, am I correct that more complicated,
multilevel models have not been derived? Or if they
have, could somebody steer me in the right direction?
A colleague and I intend to derive the models if this has
not been done previously, but we don’t want to reinvent
the wheel.

Fagus DNA AFLP
Dear Evoldir members,
I would be grateful for any help or advice with the fol-
lowing.
I am intending to investigate beech (Fagus sylvatica)
trees using AFLPs. Owing to the location of study
populations it is most likely that I will have to extract
DNA from silica gel-dried leaves rather than fresh.
Obviously, I would prefer to ﬁnd the quickest and high-
est throughput method of getting clean DNA. I’ve used
various extraction protocols in previous work but would
like to know if anyone has had any success with using
kits to extract and purify from dried leaf samples or a
favourite protocol for this situation.Also, does anyone know of any groups that are currently
working with AFLPs in beech?
Many thanks in advance,

Genetic analysis
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
to a 90% approximation cells are machines to synthe-
size and degrade ribosomes. to a 99% approximation
cells are machines to express and degrade the products
of highly expressed genes. even the nuclear membrane
appears to be little more than a passive pump to export
from the nucleus rRNAs bound to ribosomal subunits
and to keep fully assembled ribosomes outside the nu-
cleus. and yet for most of us who have done empirical28 EvolDir February 1, 2004
molecular-biology work, ribosomal proteins and rRNAs
are rather nuisances that hamper our attempts to study
truly interesting (sic) genes and gene products. this is
probably due to epistemological biases created by the
limits that history imposed on genetic analysis, e.g. by
the biased nature of the phenotypes early geneticists
were compelled to study in order to understand hered-
ity, phenotypes that acquired afterwards a unjustiﬁed
legitimacy as phenotypes tout court becoming more and
more studied and ending up shaping in an illegitimate
way our view of cells as biomachines. importantly,
this has resulted in a remarkable neglect of the over-
whelming functional and thus cyto-architectural, cyto-
metabolic, and evolutionary centrality of those cellular
functions that require extremely high levels of gene ex-
pression and gene-product turnover. below are some
thoughts about aging as it can be envisioned when one
attempts to look at the cell without the deforming op-
tics that genetic analysis has compelled most of us to
adopt unwittingly. and further below is a coda with re-
envisionings of sex, the germ line, the nucleus, somatic
mutation, etc.
feedback welcome :)
best to you all

//// transcription-associated mutation and aging
/////////////
1) transcription is well-known to be mutagenic to the
gene being transcribed and to its immediate surround-
ings (point mutations, rearrangements, etc), and an
impressive DNA repair machinery is mobilized around
the transcription bubble. 2) to a 90% approximation
cells are machines to express the genes whose prod-
ucts are necessary to carry out transcription, trans-
lation, and orderly protein and RNA degradation.
In fact, the bulk of transcription, translation, and
protein/RNA degradation in the cell is directed at
synthesizing and degrading ribomosomal-protein mR-
NAs, ribomosomal RNAs (rRNAs), ribomosomal pro-
teins, and the RNAs and proteins needed for tran-
scription and protein/RNA degradation. 3) therefore
most transcription-associated mutations that manage
to evade the surveillance of transcription-associated
repair must alter the primary-structure of the above
highly transcribed genes. 4) these genes should there-
fore accumulate mutations over the active life of a cell.
5) the accuracy and speed of transcription, translation,
and protein/RNA degradation and possibly the con-
tainment of transcription-associated mutagenicity (if
the involved genes are highly expressed), depend on
the primary-structural integrity of these highly tran-
scribed genes, genes that non-surprisingly are very con-served phylogenetically. 6) the accumulation of mu-
tations in these genes must reduce progressively the
accuracy and speed of transcription, translation, and
protein/RNA degradation in the cell, and may increase
transcription-associated mutagenicity. 7) in particular,
mutations in these highly transcribed genes must also
impair the speed and accuracy of the transcription and
translation of these genes themselves altering addition-
ally epigenetically the primary structure of the gene
products expressed by the mutated genes. 8) over the
years the speed and accuracy of transcription, transla-
tion, and protein/RNA degradation, and possibly the
containment of transcription-associated mutagenicity,
should worsen inexorably compromising quantitatively
and qualitatively the steady-state transcriptome and

caused by the huge transcription rates of these genes.

not only directly, by modifying the primary structure
of these genes and thus altering the intrinsic capa-
bility of the involved gene products to function cor-

and the speed of the transcription and translation of
these genes themselves, mutated or not, which would al-
ter their gene products additionally compounding their
loss of functionality. 11) aging may not require that
most genes mutate over time since the transcription-
associated mutations that massively expressed genes
are expected to accumulate, should suﬃce. 12) indeed
such mutations must be much more frequent than any

Georgia K12
Hi All,
Recently the Georgia Department of Education released
drafts for new K-12 science standards for public schools.February 1, 2004 EvolDir 29
These standards were based on the excellent AAAS
project 2061 benchmarks, but intentionally removed
many of the central ideas of modern science like com-
mon descent, human origins, the mere mention of “evo-
lution,” the age of the earth, plate tectonics (mostly),
the Big Bang, and human reproduction. The stan-
dards can be reviewed at http://www.glc.k12.ga.us/-
spotlight/gps2.htm . (That site also allows for com-
ments.)
More information, including links to the AAAS bench-
marks, can be found at http://www.georgiascience.org
. There is an online petition to encourage GADOE
to incorporate the entirety of the AAAS project 2061
benchmarks.

Dear colleagues, I am working on a comparative study
on life history aspects in ants and would like to haveinformation on the primary mono-/polygyny and/or
mean colony size of the diﬀerent species hereafter. This
information can in many cases not be found in the (ac-

because the data have not yet been published. I would
therefore very much appreciate it if you should have

2004: MEEGID VII and the year of Infection, Genetics
and Evolution
Dear readers,
It is my pleasure to wish you a very happy and sci-
entiﬁcally productive year 2004. This New Year will
see the arrival of the 7th session of our international
meeting “Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary
Genetics of Infectious Diseases” (MEEGID VII). The
MEEGID meetings were launched in 1996 under the
auspices of the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) in Atlanta, the Institut de Recherche pour
le D´ evelopement (IRD; the French governmental agency
for applied research in developing countries), and the
Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS;
the French governmental agency for basic research).
The MEEGID meetings have been the forum that ma-
tured the unique scientiﬁc concept of Infection, Genet-
ics and Evolution: integrating lines of research deal-30 EvolDir February 1, 2004
ing with genetics, genomics and evolutionary biology of
hosts, pathogens and vectors to disrupt the unwelcome
compartmentalization that hinders the development of
this ﬁeld of research. This scope makes the uniqueness
of the MEEGID congresses and of Infection, Genetics
and Evolution. The sole meetings and journal where
you can ﬁnd communications on human genetics, as
well as on mosquito vector morphometry and Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis phylogenetics; that welcomes works
on bacteria as well as viruses, fungi and parasites; that
encourages general methodological approaches together
with specialized research. The goal is no less than the
founding a new scientiﬁc discipline and a new scien-
tiﬁc community. MEEGID VI, July 2002, Pasteur In-
stitute, Paris (France) was quite successful. MEEGID
VII will be the session of maturity. It will be hosted in
very favorable conditions. The venue will be Valencia
(Spain), one of the most dynamic cities of a country
with ambitions to play a major role in the great Eu-
rope of 25. MEEGID VII (19-24th July 2004) has been
purposely organized in tight synchronization with the
9th European Multicolloquium of Parasitology (EMOP
IX;http://www.uv.es/emop9/ ), a large meeting of sev-
eral thousand participants. The principal EMOP IX
organizer, and local organizer of MEEGID VII, will be
Professor Santiago Mas Coma, the receiving editor of
Infection, Genetics and Evolution for Spain. MEEGID
VII will take advantage of the logistics and resources of
EMOP IX, thus saving much eﬀort. Many sessions will
be organized in common, and reduced registration fees
will be oﬀered to those who register for both congresses.
Many parasitologists who constitute the usual EMOP
audience will be attracted by the specialized sessions
of MEEGID VII, and in turn, the usual MEEGID at-
tendees will have the opportunity to learn from other
ﬁelds, such as, clinical research or ﬁeld epidemiology,
leading to a productive cross-fertilization of ideas. As
for the Paris meeting, MEEGID VII will be deﬁnitely
focused on debates, with the new formula of “express
debates” (a single talk of 20 minutes on a hot topic,
followed by a free discussion of 40 minutes). Students
will be exempted from registration fees for MEEGID
VII, and will beneﬁt from reduced fees if they attend
both MEEGID VII and EMOP IX. A speciﬁc student
symposium will be organized, with students acting as
chairs. Three awards will be given in the framework of
MEEGID VII: best communication by a student, best
communication by a scientist from the developing world
on a problem speciﬁcally relevant to their part of the
world, and best communication “all categories”.
This year will see also the ranking of our journal by the
Institute for Scientiﬁc Information (ISI). Launched in
2001, Infection, Genetics and Evolution (of which the14th issue is presently being compiled) is published now
at a rhythm of 6 issues per year. It follows and promotes
the latest developments in our ﬁeld, with for example 2
papers recently published on the molecular evolution of
the SARS virus. Its evaluation by the National Library
of Medicine (Washington) has been excellent (ranked
3.5 for a maximum of 4.0; “very good”), which led to
its coverage (starting from the 1st issue) by Medline
and Index Medicus. The visibility and traceability of
the papers published in Infection, Genetics and Evo-
lution is therefore excellent. However, many authors
still are reluctant to send papers to the journal, due
to the lack of an oﬃcial ISI impact index, the new re-
ligious mantra of many scientists. The impact index
is useful and informative, although many have recently
underlined its biases. However, for a new journal it is
a kind of vicious circle and a major challenge. How to
attract major contributions when their authors would
be able to publish them in well-established stars? How
to encourage young beginners to submit when a non-
ranked new journal will be much less relevant for their
curriculum vitae? Our journal is

taxonomy question
Mike, I haven’t run into you in a few years. Hope you
are still going strong n Zoology. I have a genetics ques-
tion for you.
I am investigating a lice problem in Oregon deer. It
appears that the deer in western Oregon have an exotic
lice on them and most likely the reason for the hair-loss
syndrome seen over the last few years. I am working
with a morphological taxonomist for biting lice and he
can identify the enus, subgenus, but is relatively certain
this is an undescribed species. I would like to follow up
on the identiﬁcation of this lice with a enetic compari-
son to conﬁrm genus and species.
Would you be able to do this type of work, or would
you be able to point me in the right direction. I realizeit would take some samples of knowns and unknowns
to do this work. These are available.

M13 primer reponses
As promised here is a collection of the main comments
that I received for my query through EvolDir concern-
ing the use of universal primer tails to ﬂuorescently
label microsatellites. Many people wrote to learn more
about the technique as a way to reduce costs. I got
many responses from people who have used this tech-
nique, and I thank them for sharing their experiences
with me. Their names are excluded to shelter them
from e-mail inundations! Thanks to all for your com-
ments, advice, and encouragement! Alexis
The basic technique is described in a number of articles,
but my primary sources were: Schuelke, M (2000) An
economic method for the ﬂuorescent labeling of PCR
fragments. Nature Biotechnology 18: 233-234
Oetting et al (1995) Linkage analysis with multiplexed
short tandem repeat polymorphisms using infrared ﬂu-
orescence and M13 tailed primers. Genomics 30 (3):
450-458
There is also a new book out on PCR including a chap-
ter by M. Scheulke. PCR Technology: Current In-
novations by Thomas Weissensteiner(Editor), Thomas
Weissensteiner, Hugh G. Griﬃn (Editor), Annette M.
Griﬃn (Editor), ISBN 0849311845
As a quick summary there is a mixed review of the
technique for large numbers of samples and multiplex-
ing many loci - for some people it works very well, but
for others it has not worked when multiplexing. Nearly
everyone seems to agree that it is exceedingly useful
for identifying useful microsatellites from a genomic li-
brary - i.e. ﬁnding how polymorphic they are and their
lengths for planning multiplexing. This is primarily due
to the cost involved when dealing with ﬂuorescently la-
beled primers such as are required for an ABI3100. The
problems people experienced were primarily in PCR,
where the two step binding process complicated opti-
mization for many people, especially when multiplexing
more than 3 loci. Few had any problems multiplexing
the fragment analysis when PCRs were done separately32 EvolDir February 1, 2004
or when a small number of loci were multiplexed in
PCR. Too many similar sized fragments with diﬀerent
dyes did cause problems moving through the capillary
for some people. A number of authors suggested that
for eﬃciency s sake, the technique was great for iden-
tifying useful loci and determining their size, but that
then using labeled speciﬁc primers was much more ef-
ﬁcient for a large number of individuals, both in terms
of time and money (optimization and PCR).
Speciﬁc tips and tricks: M13 is not the only univer-
sal tail - authors point out that there are a number of
others:
M13 Forward (-29) 5’ -CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC
-3’ M13 Reverse 5’ -GGATAACAATTTCACACAGG
-3’ T3 Promoter 5’ - AATTAACCCTCACTAAAG -
3’ T7 Promoter 5’ - TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG
-3’ SP6 Promoter 5’ -GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG -
3’ And you can ﬁnd more information about these from:
www.licor.com This can also be coupled with diﬀerent
ﬂuorescent labels. Furthermore, one respondent sug-
gested that these tails have similar melting points, so
they can potentially multiplex quite well if labeled with
diﬀerent colors (or if there is a suﬃcient size diﬀerence
between loci).
Someone who has had success with multiplexing 6 loci
in PCR suggests using a QIAgen multiplexing kit (cat#
206143) which despite being recommended for 50ul re-
actions works well with 15ul reactions. This also seems
to space the loci apart a bit more than normal making
similar sized loci easier to tell apart!
Extending the cycling time may also help(1 min dena-
ture, 1minute anneal, 1.5 minute extension).
Making your own size standard is both economical and
very helpful to multiplexing since it can allow packing
in more loci into one run.
Fluorescently labeled UTPs (fUTP) works on some ma-
chines - this means you dont need to buy the labeled
primers. The problem is ﬁguring out which matrix on
the sequencer works best in reading it. Blue fUTPs
worked on ABI 377.
HotStar Taq helps a great deal when multiplexing PCR.
It seems to reduce accidental binding between primers.

Marine genetic markers
Apologies for cross postings
Dear members
A few years ago (1997) our group posted a query regard-
ing the use of molecular genetic markers in marine ﬁsh-
ery management and received some useful responses.
We are now compiling a review and need more up toFebruary 1, 2004 EvolDir 33
date information on their use. We are particularly in-
terested in cases where genetic data has inﬂuenced a
management plan for a particular stock or species. Are
you or a colleague using genetics for ﬁsheries and if so
for what sort of application? Any help would be greatly
appreciated, even if its only a reference to a website, or-
ganisation or, of course published materials.

NEON NatlEcolObsNet
NEON - National Ecological Observatory Network -
NSF Funding (Other) Through a series of workshops,
reports, and planning activities the research community
determined that the National Ecological Observatory
Network (NEON) should be the new tool: a continent-
wide research platform, composed of networked state-
of-the-art analytical and communication technologies.
NEON will create new collaborative environments, sup-
port multi-and inter-disciplinary research, stimulate in-
novative approaches to information management, de-
velop human capital, and facilitate the integration of
research and education across a wide range of the bio-
logical, geophysical, engineering and social sciences.
The Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National
Science Foundation announces its intention to support
the establishment of a NEON Coordinating Consortium
(NCC), which will provide the scientiﬁc leadership, ad-
ministration, community participation, and overall gov-
ernance of NEON and include a NEON Project Oﬃce.
The latter will initially plan and coordinate activities
for NEON, while, ultimately, it will be responsible for
the construction and daily management of NEON.
Identiﬁcation of the goals of NEON must include evo-
lutionary perspective in order for this activity to have
its broadest and most eﬀective application. Therefore,
involvement of evolutionary biologists at all levels of
NEON is exceptionally important as this major fund-
ing and research eﬀort gets underway.

Subject: A request for Senecioneae material
Dear colleagues,
Joachim Kadereit, Bertil Nordenstam, Linda Watson,
and Pieter Pelser have recently started up a project that
aims to resolve the intergeneric molecular phylogeny of
the tribe Senecioneae (Asteraceae). Initially Joachim
Kadereit and Bertil Nordenstam will focus on the Old
World representatives of this tribe and Linda Watson
and Pieter Pelser will study the New World taxa.
We now ask you to help us to obtain a taxon sampling
that covers all (ca. 140) genera in Senecioneae and most
subgenera and sections of large genera in this tribe in-
cluding of course Senecio. We are especially interested
in obtaining material of type species of the genera in
Senecioneae and the various sections of Senecio.
You can help us in various ways. For instance by:
1) sending us tissue/DNA samples or well preserved
herbarium specimens of Senecioneae, 2) providing us
with a list of fresh Senecioneae material present in your
institute or private collection, or by 3) sending us the
contact information of people that might be able to help
us.34 EvolDir February 1, 2004
Material or information can be sent to Pelser (New
World) or Kadereit (Old World).
Please contact any of us if you wish to receive a list of
New World or Old World Senecioneae genera or addi-
tional information. Of course, we will acknowledge your
help and will keep you informed about the progress of
this project.

PositiveSelection
DATAMONKEY: DETECTING SELECTION ON IN-
DIVIDUAL AMINO ACID SITES
Interested in looking for positive selection in sequence
data? Like maximum likelihood, but tired of waiting?
Worried about synonymous variation in your dataset?
Worry no more!
We are proud to announce the launch of DataMonkey
(http://www.datamonkey.org ), a web-based interface
to HyPhy ( http://www.hyphy.org ), a multi-platform,
free phylogenetic analysis program.
Our ﬁrst tool to be made available is a heavily modi-
ﬁed and eﬃciently implemented version of the method
of Suzuki and Gojobori (Molecular Biology And Evo-
lution, 1999, 16:1315-1328), which detects positive and
negative selection on individual amino acid sites. In
brief, the method involves counting the number of non-
synonymous and synonymous substitutions that have
occurred at each site over its evolutionary history, based
on a maximum likelihood ancestral reconstruction ob-
tained using a codon-based substitution model.
Features include:
* Fast turnaround of results, e.g. 100 sequences, 100
codons each will run in <1 minute. * Import of
NEXUS, PHYLIP and FASTA formats, with two meth-
ods for handling ambiguous codons. * Use of a large
number of genetic codes. * Choice of using a user-
speciﬁed phylogeny or generation of a neighbor-joining
tree. * Choice of any underlying reversible nucleotide
model, with maximum likelihood estimation of param-
eters. * Choice of user-supplied or estimated global
dN/dS. * Generation of HTML and CSV reports. *
User-customizable plots of nonsynonymous and synony-
mous rate variation.
Currently, analyses are restricted to 100 sequences/ 10
000 codons, but this restriction may be lifted depend-February 1, 2004 EvolDir 35
ing upon level of interest and availability of computer
resources.
A preprint describing the method is available on the
DataMonkey website. A suite of other approaches to
detect positive selection, which take uncertainty in an-
cestral reconstruction into account, are also described
within the preprint, and are implemented within the
current build of HyPhy. This research was sup-
ported by the National Institutes of Health (grant
numbers 5 R01 AI47745 and 5 U01 AI43638 Supp),
the University of California Universitywide AIDS Re-
search Program (grant number IS02-SD-701), and by a

Software IBD v1 5
The software “IBD” for analyzing (genetic) isolation by
(geographic) distance has been updated to version 1.5.
IBD is a fast, simple and specialized package for Mac
and Windows that will analyze 1) raw data from
diploid/codominant marker data sets (e.g., allozymes,
microsatellites) 2) geographic and genetic distance ma-
trices that have been derived using any method
- Like other packages, IBD will test for a statistical as-
sociation between the distance and geographic matrices
using a Mantel Test.
- IBD will also determine the STRENGTH of this rela-
tionship by regressing all pairwise genetic similarity val-
ues against their corresponding geographic distances,
using Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regression.
- Conﬁdence intervals for the regression statistics are
calculated using a number of diﬀerent approaches, some36 EvolDir February 1, 2004
of which account for the nonindependence of data
points.
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
Improvements since version 1.2 include:
- A summary of the results is saved in a tab-delimited
text ﬁle. - Input ﬁles can be in matrix format, pairwise
lists, or raw data. - The genetic distances M (Slatkin)
and F/(1-F)(Rousset) are calculated from raw data. -
Partial Mantel tests can be used to assess partial cor-
relations between genetic distance and two additional
matrices.

volunteer
We are studying Wolbachia induced sex ratio distortion
in the butterﬂy Hypolimnas bolina, and are looking for
a volunteer to help collect and breed Hypolimnas but-
terﬂies in S.E. Asia for a period of four to eight weeks
in spring/summer 2004.
The volunteer would be working alongside a graduate
student in the ﬁeld. We are keen to ﬁnd a commit-
ted individual, with independence, who is prepared to
work in basic facilities in tropical ﬁeld conditions. Ex-
cellent basic health and ﬁtness is therefore a prerequi-
site. Fieldwork experience and a biological/ecological
background, would also be welcome. We are happy to
contribute towards the fare to S.E. Asia, and also with
daily living expenses during the visit.

Used sequencers
Dear Evoldir Members, I am about to buy used capil-
lary automatic genetic analyser with programs both for
sequencing and fragment analysis (STRs). The prob-
lem is that I don’t have much money but still wish to
buy a machine capable to analyse at least 96 samples
daily (as far as I know ABi 310 is much slower). I wish
to know your opinions about: - which device would be
good for STRs but also well-suited to sequencing? -
where I should look for used lab equipement? Maybe
some of you want to earn that “easy” money ;) - what
properties of used stuﬀ are most crucial for it’s factual
value?

mtDNA recombination answers
Dear all,
A long time ago, I posted a query regarding how
mtDNA recombination would aﬀect the coalescent timeof neutral mutation (would it make mitochondrial Eve
younger or older?). I tried to post the answers in the
past, but it seems that there was a problem. I am post-
ing it again, because a lot of you got in contact with
me asking for the answers.
The topic generated a lot of interest, and I have in-
cluded a summary of the responses below.
I would like to thank you for sending me your opinions.
I think that for this subject it is very diﬃcult tocome
toa conclusion.
Regards,
Anastasios Tsaousis
—- Paper by Shirup and Hein (2001 or 2002) indi-
cates that the coalescenttime would be greater. Basi-
cally recombination takes the most recentcommon an-
cestor and places it in two separate portions of the phy-
logenysuch that these two new ancestors have to have
a MRCA even further backin the tree.
Francis Villablanca, Ph.D. —- I would like to take this
opportunity to suggest a recent paper that appeared
in the journal of mathematical biology: “Conditional
ancestral times and related properties of an extant mu-
tant at a locus A given the number of segregating sites
at a linked locus B.” It just might be of interest to you
in regard to your question to the EvoDir.
Dr. Paul F. Slade —- It should make it older, as it
essentially increases the Ne. There areseveral good pa-
pers out there that discuss this in detail.
Dr. Tina M. Hambuch —- It would depend. Re-
combo with male mtDNA would lead to an underes-
timateof Eve’s age. However, the assumption of a coa-
lescent model wouldproduce younger ages. See Hagel-
berg, Trends in Genetics, 2003, 19:84-90. Dr. Connie J.
Mulligan —- Recombination lowers the variance in the
time to most recentcommon ancestor, it does not eﬀect
the mean time.Thus, if there is recombination in the
mtDNA, the expect timeto MRCA is unchanged, but
the variance in that estimate islikely to be lower (i.e.
the estimate is likely to be better).All this is in the ab-
sence of natural selection. If we assumethat selection
exists, all bets are oﬀ.
David J. Cutler, Ph. D. —- The short answer is that
the genealogy will vary along the sequence, sothat there
is no single most recent common ancestor for the se-
quence asa whole. The distribution of the neutral coa-
lescent at single sites willbe uninﬂuenced by recombina-
tion, but the genealogies at diﬀerent siteswill represent
correlated draws from this distribution.As for biased
estimation of coalescent times using recombinant se-
quences,that will depend on the estimator used. One38 EvolDir February 1, 2004
discussion of these mattersis given in the following refer-
ence:Schierup, MH and Hein, J. 2000. Consequences of
recombination ontraditional phylogenetic analysis. Ge-
netics 156: 879-891. In general, the estimators are com-
plicated non-linear functionals of thedata so that ana-
lytical results are very diﬃcult to obtain. However, itis
relatively easy to simulate sequences using a coalescent
process withrecombination and then numerically deter-
mine the bias for any particularestimator.A complicat-
ing issue is that population structure can either mask
orenhance the eﬀects of recombination on the appar-
ent phylogeny. Forexample, if the rate of coalescence
within populations is much greaterthan the migration
rate between populations, then the tree may decompo-
seinto well-deﬁned nets corresponding to distinct pop-
ulations. Providedthat there is a unique ancestral pop-
ulation, the eﬀect of recombinationon estimates of the
time to the most recent common ancestor will belim-
ited to recombination events which oc cur in the basal
portion of thegenealogy. If the coalescent time is dom-
inated by the time required forall of the sequences to
have ancestors in this one population, then thebias dueto recombination will be reduced relative to the panmic-
tic case.Of course, one can also construct scenarios in
which the bias is greaterthan would be expected under
panmixis.Dr. Jay Taylor —- If there is recombination
mitochondrial Eve does not exist, but of course Eve,
ourmost recent common ancestor does. Recombination
will mean that we haveunderestimated the age of Eve
- see attached paper in which this is explained insome
detail.
Dr. A.C.Eyre-Walker
—- Mikkel Schierup has done some work on the eﬀect
of ignoringrecombination in HIV: http://www.birc.dk/-
Publications/Articles/Schierup 2002a.pdfThis suggests
that ignoring recombination will tend to cause anover-
estimation of the date of MRCA.

UCincinnati EvolBiol
Two NSF-funded postdoctoral positions in EVOLU-
TIONARY GENETICS are available at the University
of Cincinnati. We seek highly motivated evolutionary
biologists with a broad conceptual foundation to study
evolutionary processes in animal populations. The suc-
cessful candidates will join an expanding group of in-
teractive faculty, students and postdocs in ecology, evo-
lution and behavior ( http://www.biology.uc.edu/ ).
1) COMPARATIVE LANDSCAPE GENETICS. This
project involves testing components of dispersal and
speciation models in Darwin1s ﬁnches. The approach
is to compare multilocus molecular genetic variation
among populations and species to infer evolutionary
processes. Good quantitative skills are essential, and
experience with molecular laboratory methods will be
considered a strength. Speciﬁc skills of coalescent mod-
eling, genotyping ancient DNA, phylogeographic anal-
ysis, or comparisons among molecular markers will be
considered advantageous. Position available March 1,
2004. Contact: Ken Petren (ken.petren@uc.edu).
2) EVOLUTION OF PARASITE RESISTANCE. The
research will test for costs of genetically-based resis-
tance against parasitism in the Drosophila-Macrocheles
mite system, in the context of understanding the role
of life-history tradeoﬀs in the maintenance of genetic
variation for ﬁtness in natural populations. Empha-
sis will be placed on testing for pleiotropic costs under
variable stress conditions to which the host organism
is known to be exposed in its natural Sonoran Desert
habitat. Knowledge of quantitative genetics, experi-
mental design and statistics is desired. Position avail-
able September 1, 2004. Contact: Michal Polak (po-
lakm@email.uc.edu).
The successful candidates will be expected to work in-
dependently and will have the opportunity to develop
their own research project. These positions are avail-
able for a full year with the possibility of renewal.
Salary will be commensurate with experience. Inquiries
may be directed to the contacts above. Please send by
email a CV, list of publications, a brief description of
past and future research interests, and the names andFebruary 1, 2004 EvolDir 49

BBSRC-funded Post-Doctoral Research Fellow Depart-

The mating ’gifts’ of D. melanogaster males: functions
and ﬁtness eﬀects of male seminal ﬂuid accessory gland
proteins.
A full-time BBSRC funded post-doctoral position is
available for 36 months in the fruit-ﬂy laboratory of
Dr Tracey Chapman in the Department of Biology
at University College London ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/-
˜ucbhtoc/tc1.html ). The seminal ﬂuid proteins of male
fruit ﬂies have striking eﬀects on female behaviour and
physiology. For example, they can reduce female sexual
receptivity, increase egg laying and contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to success in sperm competition. Seminal ﬂuid
proteins are also implicated in mediating conﬂicts of in-
terests between males and females over reproductive de-
cisions (e.g. Chapman et al. 1995 Nature 373, 241-244).
The genes encoding seminal ﬂuid proteins can show ex-
traordinarily rapid evolutionary change. In this project
we will study the function of seminal ﬂuid proteins im-
plicated in important ﬁtness traits. We will use RNA
interference to knock down speciﬁc seminal ﬂuid pro-
tein levels in males (e.g. Chapman et al. 2003 PNAS,
100, 9923-9928). The research will involve the construc-
tion, veriﬁcation and testing of transgenic strains of
fruit ﬂies. The candidate should therefore have experi-
ence in general molecular biology and ﬂywork. Experi-
ence in constructing transgenic strains is highly desir-
able. The state-of-the-art fruit ﬂy facility is situated
in the thriving research environment of the recently re-
furbished Centre for Evolutionary Genomics. Starting
salary is 20,311 GBP per annum pro-rata (22,445 GBP
including London Allowance).To apply and for further information, please send
a covering letter and a CV with the names and
contact details of 3 referees to Tracey Chapman

School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia
Genetic Diversity in Refugial Trees
A postdoctoral position is available from April 2004
for a period of 3 years in a UK NERC funded joint
project between UEA Norwich and University of Leeds.
This project seeks to combine recent fossil pollen results
in Greece and the Balkans, with genetic studies using
DNA sequence analysis of trees from refugial and non
refugial sites. The oak and hornbeam are chosen as ex-
emplars of temperate species with good fossil records.
Informative chloroplast DNA regions will be identiﬁed
and sequenced using state of the art facilities in Biology
and adjacent John Innes Centre. The large dataset will
be analysed by modern computer-based methods that
take full advantage of the sequence information. These
analyses will allow us to test hypotheses concerning the
structure and dynamics of refugial areas, and their role
in colonizing non-refugial areas in the Balkans and Eu-
rope. In Norwich we seek a postdoctoral researcher
competent in generating and analysing the molecular
data, and to be involved in the ﬁeld collection of sam-
ples and the interpretation of results. Comparison with
palaeobotanical information will be done in conjunction
with Dr Chronis Tzedakis, University of Leeds.
Salary will be £20,311 per annum (under review).

UC Davis WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGE-
NETICS at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay,
California May 2-7, 2004 with a special supplementary
course on Supertree Construction May 9-11, 2004 spon-
sored by the Center for Biosystematics, Bodega Marine
Laboratory, and Center for Population Biology, Uni-
versity of California, Davis Introduction. Phylogenetic
methods have revolutionized modern systematics and
become indispensable tools in evolution, ecology and
comparative biology, playing an increasingly important
role in analyses of biological data at levels of organiza-
tion ranging from molecules to ecosystems. The con-
struction of phylogenetic trees is becoming a method-
ology that is well-deﬁned, with broad agreement on the
central issues and questions. A nearly standard set of
topics is now taught as part of the curriculum at many
colleges and universities. On the other hand, appli-
cations of phylogenetic methods to interesting prob-
lems outside of systematics is an area of special ex-
citement, innovation, and controversy, and perspectives
vary widely.
In May, 2004, for the ﬁfth year, we will teach a work-
shop for graduate students interested in applying phylo-
genetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The one-
week course will be an intensive exploration of prob-
lems to which modern phylogenetic tools are being ap-
plied, including topics in biogeography, ecology, con-
servation biology, phylogenomics, functional morphol-
ogy, macroevolution, speciation, and character evolu-
tion. The course leads oﬀ with recent advances in phy-
logenetic methodology, and then turns to methods and
tools that can be brought to bear to address these “ap-
plied” issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
This year we will also teach a special three day sup-
plementary workshop on supertree construction–the as-
sembly of large trees from collections of smaller ones.
Supertree methods are an increasingly important tool
in phylogenetics and comparative biology. We will ex-
amine currently available methods and software tools
and examine supertree construction critically from sev-
eral perspectives. Instructors in this part of the course
include several individuals who have developed new su-
pertree methods, supertree software or both.The course will be held entirely at Bodega Marine
Lab on the Northern California coast, which has newly
renovated facilities, including extensive computing re-
sources and on-site housing. The course format will
involve equal parts of lecture, discussion, and training
in software and internet tools. One afternoon during
the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips to local natural
areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered in the ﬁrst week
Finding, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic trees;
phylogenetic databases Recent advances in tree re-
construction: Bayesian inference; stochastic optimiza-
tion strategies; divide-and-conquer methods Analysis of
character evolution–theory: parsimony, likelihood and
Bayesian approaches; null models and statistical test-
ing Analysis of character evolution–form and function
of complex character systems Phylogenetic biogeogra-
phy and phylogeography; coalescent methods for infer-
ring migration rates and patterns Phylogenetic compar-
ative methods Phylogenetic perspectives on biodiver-
sity and conservation biology Data mining of sequence
databases for phylogenetic analysis Estimation of diver-
gence times from sequence data

RiodeJaneiro Complexity Nov
Workshop on Complexity and Philosophy Co-hosted
by:Federal university of Rio de JaneiroInstitute for
the Study of Coherence and EmergenceCathedra for
the Study of Complexity (Instituto de Filosoﬁa de
La Habana) Calling Notice November 2004, Rio de
Janeiro(exact dates to be determined shortly) Call
for Participants I am writing to you today to in-
form you about the upcoming two-day Complexity
and Philosophy workshop to be held this November
(2004) in Rio de Janeiro and hosted by the Institute
for the Study of Coherence and Emergence( http://-
www.isce.edu ), U.F.R.J. (Federal university of Rio de
Janeiro), and the Cathedra for the Study of Complex-
ity (Instituto de Filosoﬁa de La Habana) . The aim of
this meeting is to explore the philosophical implications
of the ﬂedgling science of complex systems. This work-
shop complements the 2nd Biennial International Semi-
nar on the Philosophical, Epistemological and Method-
ological Iimplications of Complexity Theory that was
held in Havana, Cuba, January 2004. The larger inter-
national seminar provides a forum to discuss complex-
ity and philosophy-related issues in general, whereas
the aim of the smaller workshop event is to consider
speciﬁc issues at a greater length with more time made
available for discussion rather than presentation. The
location for the workshop event is expected to change
location each time it is held. In 2002 the event was
held in Norwood (just outside Boston) in the US. This
time we are pleased to announce that the next event
will be held in Rio de Janeiro, with the very generous
assistance of the Federal university of Rio de Janeiro.
Call for Papers Potential attendees are encouraged to
submit papers on the following topics: Status, limits
and legitimacy of knowledge regarding complex systems
Relationship between linear and nonlinear philosophies
Complexity-based ethics Frameworks for the analysis
of complex systems Complex limits to ‘theories of ev-
erything’ Complexity and the social sciences Complex-February 1, 2004 EvolDir 57
ity and globalization Complexity and human subjectiv-
ity All paper submissions will be considered for publi-
cation in the international journal Emergence: Com-
plexity and Organization (depending upon suitability),
and/or publication in an edited book of papers to be
published by IAP Press as part of ISCE’s Managing
the Complex Book Series. Selected papers from the
previous event have appeared in Nonlinear Dynamics,
Psychology and the Life Sciences, and this journal may
again prove to be a publishing avenue for selected pa-
pers. All papers will be considered for publication even
if time cannot be found for the papers to be presented
at the conference itself (the emergent properties of such
an event and the organiser’s hope to focus on discus-
sion/dialogue rather than a standard presentation for-
mat may at times dictate the proceedings). Provisional
Timetable Please let Caroline Richardson (complexity-
workshop@isce.edu) know of your interest in attending
this event as soon as possible. Attendance at the event
will be strictly limited to 30 so as to encourage genuine
dialogue amongst participants - selection of attendees
will be determined simply on a ﬁrst come ﬁrst serve ba-
sis. A block of 30 rooms will be reserved for the event
and a reduced room rate (that includes breakfast) will
be negotiated. Final details concerning hotel rates will
be made available in the next month or so. Extended
abstracts of at least 1000 words to be submitted to Dr.
Kurt Richardson (kurt@kurtrichardson.com) by end of
July, 2004. The decision by the academic board (which
will comprise members of I.S.C.E.’s fellowship) to en-
courage submission of a full paper - to be no longer
than 5000 words - will occur by end of August, 2004.
Full papers to be submitted by end of October, 2004.
The decision as to what papers will be published and
in what form will occur shortly after the closing of the
conference. It is hoped that participants will play an
integral role in the development of the event timetable
before and during the event. The exact cost of registra-
tion will be determined shortly, but fees are expected
to be around US$300. As well as administrative and lo-
cation costs, fees will also cover lunch during the event
as well as a Brazilian-style dinner event at the close
of the second day. Participants will be responsible for
their own hotel costs. If you would like to attend the
workshop please send an email to Caroline Richardson
(complexityworkshop@isce.edu) with the following in-
formation: Name, academic aﬃliation and status if any,
address, phone, fax, and email. Caroline will contact
you for further information re hotel conﬁrmation and
payment of workshop fees. If you have any questions at
all please do not hesitate to contact Kurt or Caroline

Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research
Education and Training Core Laboratory oﬀer a hands-
on workshop:
Microsatellites are a powerful class of genetic markers
used in a variety of molecular studies such as determin-
ing ﬁne scale population structure, parentage, and indi-
vidual identiﬁcation. The genomes of most eukaryotes
contain thousands of loci containing short nucleotide se-
quence motifs tandemly repeated many times, such as
(CT/GA)n. The repeat units tend to be highly poly-
morphic, and several loci taken together produce a ge-
netic ﬁngerprint that is consistent and unchanging from
one individual to the next. While readily used and an-
alyzed, it is generally necessary to develop a new set
of markers for each species, as there tends to be little
crossover between species unless fairly closely related.
Developing a microsatellite library can be a long and
troublesome task, especially for those with limited
molecular background. This workshop will take par-
ticipants through the steps used to build an enriched
microsatellite library using DNA from their species of
interest using a variety of molecular techniques such re-
striction enzyme digestion, ligation, PCR, and several
screening protocols to ﬁnd loci containing polymorphic
repeat motifs. Participants will also learn about primer
design and statistical analyses.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
