Berlin CelebratingDarwin Mar3-6
Dear evolutionary biologists, Darwin’s 1859 book “On
the Origin of Species” contained only a single ﬁgure de-
picting a tree diagram of species origins and relation-
ships. This little scheme was nevertheless the start-
ing point for the ubiquity of phylogenetic trees in to-
day’s zoology. Every week numerous cladograms repre-
senting animal relationships at all levels are published.
An increasing number of these articles deal with the
phylogeny of the major groups of multicellular animals
(Metazoa). However, these publications show that nei-
ther sequence data nor available morphological charac-
ter sets produce phylogenies that converge to a widely
accepted consensus. It is obvious that some traditional
views cannot be maintained and that a new framework
of animal phylogeny is emerging. Nevertheless, the
large number of contradicting trees indicates that some
fundamental problems of phylogenetic studies have not
been discovered or resolved.
The international conference *“Celebrating Darwin:
From /The Origin of Species/ to Deep Metazoan Phy-
logeny” *brings together mathematicians, theorists,
molecular systematists, and morphologists interested in
a critical review of known pitfalls and in the presenta-
tion of new analytical tools, new types of characters,
and a synopsis of molecular and morphological charac-
ters. It is intended to get a critical and constructive
view of the state of the art.On behalf of the organising committee we would like to
invite you to this conference, which will take place from
*3th - 6th March 2009 *at the Humboldt-University
and the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, Germany.
The meeting will consist of sessions with several invited
speakers and open sessions with short presentations. In
addition, there will be the possibility to show posters.
The meeting focuses on three major themes:
*1) Innovations in analyses of molecular and morpho-
logical data*
*2) Molecular phylogeny: new markers and phyloge-
nomic analyses*
*3) The indispensability of morphology *
The conference is organised by the Priority Program
“Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” of the German Science
Foundation (DFG). The project is a joint eﬀort of
more than 20 participating workgroups bringing to-
gether molecular, morphological and bioinformatic ex-
pertise with the goal to establish a robust (hopefully)
backbone tree of metazoans. Details on the priority
project “Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” can be found at:
http://www.deep-phylogeny.org/ . For more informa-
tion and to register please visit our website:

London e-Bioshpere Jun1-5 2The e-Biosphere 09 Conference will be held in London
on 1-3 June 2009. The conference has three principal
goals:
* To highlight the achievements and capabilities of Bio-
diversity Informatics; * To provide practitioners and
users of Biodiversity Informatics with opportunities to
interact and share information; and * To gather input
from practitioners and users that will help guide the
development of Biodiversity Informatics over the com-
ing 5-10 years. Representatives of major Biodiversity
Informatics initiatives will meet for two days following
the Conference to use this input to develop an R&D
roadmap.
The Conference will stress panel discussions, break-out
discussion groups, and other meeting formats that will
promote active involvement by participants. The Con-
ference agenda will include time for break-out discus-
sion meetings of communities of practitioners and users
of Biodiversity Informatics. The Conference organiz-
ers will soon launch web-based discussion groups and
town-hall meetings through which these communities
can develop Position Papers that will be ﬁnalised at
the Conference.
The e-Biosphere 09 Conference will be an ex-
cellent opportunity for developers of biodiversity
databases and software to give demonstrations to
the community. Instructions for exhibitors is avail-
able at http://www.e-biosphere09.org/assets/ﬁles/-
Exhibitors07Jul08.pdf . The Conference website
(www.e-biosphere09.org ) now has:
* The Programme of speakers * Call for Abstracts for
poster presentation * Applications for Travel Bursaries
for participants from developing countries and doctoral
students, and * Pre-registration online form * Hotel in-

IslandEvolution Feb12-13
Announcement International Congress ISLAND EVO-
LUTION 150 YEARS AFTER DARWIN
150 Years after Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, is-
land evolution is entering a new phase. By habitat frag-
mentation, we humans create more and more islands,
while at the same time, by transporting species from
their native biomes, we remove the dispersal barriers
that kept habitats isolated.
To explore the implications of this new era of island evo-
lution, the National Museum of Natural History in Lei-
den, the Netherlands, together with the Darwin Center
for Biogeology in Utrecht, the Netherlands, will organ-
ise an international congress on
“Island Evolution 150 Years After Darwin” 12 & 13
February 2009 Museum Naturalis Leiden, the Nether-
lands
The meeting will bring together traditional students
of island biotas, experimental/theoretical community
ecologists, and evolutionary biologists, to explore the
role of island-biological processes in a world in whichNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 7
the “island processes” of isolation and dispersal are be-
ing drastically altered.
Registration fee: Early (before 15 January 2009): ? 150
(regular participants); ? 100 (students) Late (15 Jan-
uary 2009 and later): ? 175 (regular participants); ?
125 (students) The registration fee covers book of ab-
stracts, ice-breaker, free entry to the museum, lunches,
buﬀet dinner, Darwin Year opening reception, and re-
freshments.
Registration closes on January 28th, 2009. Abstracts
for posters (A1 format, 59.4 x 84.0 cm) should be sub-
mitted to Jeremy Miller (miller@naturalis.nl) before
December 15th, 2008.

Stellenbosch InvasiveSpecies Aug
The 10th International Conference on the Evolution
and Management of Alien Plant Invasions under the
theme “Eﬀective intervention through enhanced collab-
oration” will be held in Stellenbosch, Western Cape,
South Africa in August 2009. EMAPi10 will be of in-
terest to a broad audience, from ecologists, evolutionary
biologists, restoration ecologists and managers.
Speciﬁc focuss areas will include molecular evolution
of plant invasions, Invader-induced trophic cascades,
Novel ecosystems, Human dimensions of plant inva-
sions, Mapping & modelling of plant invasions, Meth-
ods for risk analysis in biosecurity,Managing invasive
plants ~learning from successes and failures, Plant in-
vasions in protected areas, Plant invasions in arid ar-
eas special problems, special solutions, Nurseries never-
ending source of invasive species?, Biofuels ~a major
source of problems with invasive plants in the future?,
Communication, education & social marketing ~beyond
pretty posters to behaviour change.
South Africa, and speciﬁcally the Western Cape region,
is home to one of the world’s most diverse ﬂoras. Un-
fortunately the country also has a long history of prob-
lems with alien plant invasions. However, South Africa
boasts some of the world’s most innovative and success-
ful management programmes to protect its biodiversity
for future generations.
Stellenbosch lies in the heart of South Africa’s
winelands with spectacular natural surroundings. It
is a short drive from Cape Town international airport
and the mother city. Stellenbosch oﬀers a vibrant scene
characterized by fantastic restaurants, night life, his-
tory and spectacular scenery.

NicheEvolution
Ph.D. Position Open
Project: Evolutionary Niche dyNamics of Invasive12 EvolDir November 1, 2008
Species (ENNIS)
Project Description: The ENNIS project seeks to un-
derstand the relationship between the evolutionary his-
tory of a clade, the niche variation and accompanying
variation in the distribution of species, and the ten-
dency for plant species to become invasive and/or nat-
uralized. The project will focus on clades that have
naturalized and invasive species in Switzerland and
central Europe. We will use an interdisciplinary ap-
proach that includes activities in niche modeling, se-
quencing DNA regions, phylogenetic reconstruction and
modeling trait evolution. The research includes char-
acterization of the environmental niches and distribu-
tion of clade members using multivariate statistics and
niche-based species distribution modeling; bioinformat-
ics approaches to the use of sequence and phylogenetic
databases, and use of other databases on the distribu-
tion of invasive species. A substantial portion of the
research will involve production of DNA sequence data
to complete phylogenetic trees of species in clades that
contain invasive and naturalized species in central Eu-
rope. Collection of material for sequencing, and addi-
tional data on species global distributions, will involve
visiting national herbaria, botanical gardens, individual
researchers, and doing ﬁeldwork throughout the sum
distribution of the species in the focal clades. Phylo-
genetic reconstruction of evolutionary relationships will
be undertaken using likelihood and Bayesian methods.
Modeling of evolutionary processes of ecological diver-
siﬁcation will be approached through the use of exper-
imental software and the development of original algo-
rithms.
The Ph.D. Student Position
Description The position includes funding for salary,
travel and all research expenses for three years. You
will be matriculated in the Ecology and Evolution doc-
toral program of the University of Lausanne (UNIL),
Switzerland, and will be a member of both the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution (DEE) at that institu-
tion and at the Federal Research Institute WSL, located
in Birmensdorf near Z¨ urich. You will spend substan-
tial periods in residence at both institutions during the
three-year period under the supervision of Drs. Peter
B. Pearman (WSL) and Nicolas Salamin (UNIL).

1 PhD Position in Evolutionary and Physiological Ecol-
ogy
Job description: We are looking for a PhD student
(m/f) in evolutionary and physiological ecology.
The PhD position is part of the project /Evo-
lutionary consequences of an urbanizing world/
funded by the Volkswagen-Foundation within the
research initiative /Evolutionary Biology/ ( http://-
www.volkswagenstiftung.de/index.php?id=3&L=1 <
http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/index.php?id=-
3&L=1 >). In this project we study the urbanization
of animals and its ecological and evolutionary conse-
quences.
Project description: Human impact in the global bio-
sphere now controls many major facets of ecosystem
function. One of the most striking man-made environ-
mental changes is the existence and rapidly ongoing
spread of urban areas. Human ecological impact has
enormous evolutionary consequences as well and can
greatly accelerate evolutionary change in the species
around us. Anecdotal observations and recent stud-
ies support the idea that urbanization aﬀects daily and
seasonal organization of activities such as daily activ-
ity pattern, reproduction and migration of individuals
thriving in urban areas. Using automated biotelemetry
techniques (e.g. activity transmitters and light inten-
sity micro loggers) the PhD project is aimed at under-
standing on the individual level to what extend urban
life changes daily and seasonal organization of Euro-
pean blackbirds and to elucidate the causes and con-
sequences of altered daily and annual rhythms in an
rapidly urbanizing world.
Requirements: We are looking for an enthusiastic per-
son, who is interested in behavioral ecology, physiol-
ogy (endocrinology) and evolution, with good organiza-
tional skills, able to work independently as well as in a
team (ﬁeld experience with birds is advantageous), who
would like to take this unique opportunity to combine
ﬁeld with lab work at the well-equipped Max-Planck-
Institute for Ornithology.
Appointment: Starting date is January 1 2009 or later.16 EvolDir November 1, 2008
The appointment will be on a temporary basis for a
maximum of 4 years. The gross salary starts at ap-
proximately 1400,- per month depending on age and
experience (TV¨ oD 13/2, Stufe 1).
Information: Additional information about
this appointment is available upon request
from Jesko Partecke (partecke@orn.mpg.de
<mailto:partecke@orn.mpg.de > or ++49-7732-
1501-67). More general information about the

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY OF SAILFIN AND AMA-
ZON MOLLIES
Teaching Assistantship for MS or Ph. D.
Applications are being sought for one student interested
in pursuing an academic career studying various aspects
of the behavior of sailﬁn and Amazon mollies starting
no later than January 2009. Amazon mollies, Poecilia
formosa, are a clonal, all female species that are essen-
tially sexual parasites as they require sperm from the
closely related sailﬁn molly, P. latipinna to start the de-
velopment of their eggs but do not use it to fertilize their
eggs. Conﬂict exists between male sailﬁn mollies that
prefer to mate with conspeciﬁcs and Amazon mollies
that require matings with these males. We are look-
ing for a student to work on some aspects of this sys-
tem and can supply Teaching Assistantships for the fall
and spring terms. See http://www.bio.txstate.edu/-
˜ gabor/gabor.htm for details about our lab and our
research interests.
The Department of Biology oﬀers a strong environment
in evolutionary ecology as the basis for training in be-
havioral ecology. Students will beneﬁt from interactions
with other faculty interested in evolutionary questions
such as: Jim Ott (Insect-plant interactions and ecolog-
ical genetics), Noland Martin (Plant population genet-ics), and Chris Nice (Speciation in insects and phylo-
geography). We have both General Biology and Popu-
lation and Conservation Biology MS programs available
and a Doctoral program in Aquatic Resources.

TurtleConservationGenetics
Evolutionary and conservation genetics of the Hawks-
bill turtle
Start Date October 2009
Funding open to UK and EU candidates
Genetic studies have determined many aspects of the
biology of marine turtles, e.g. population structure,
migration and natal philopatry, however little work has
been done on their mating systems. Although it is easy
to observe females nesting it is normally impossible to
know the identity of the males that have fertilised the
eggs as mating happens at sea, often a long way away
from the nesting grounds. Such details are of evolu-
tionary interest but also crucial in directing the con-
servation of this highly vulnerable group. For example,
knowing paternity means that the eﬀective population
size can be estimated. Determining mating preferences
can also be important - if females prefer bigger males
then the loss of such males through poaching may be18 EvolDir November 1, 2008
highly detrimental. Alternatively, if females prefer ge-
netically dissimilar males to reduce inbreeding, popu-
lation fragmentation may have a greater impact than
previously thought. The PhD will assess patterns of pa-
ternity and genetic diversity within the Cousine island
population of the hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbri-
cata. No such information is currently available on this
species. This information will be used to determine the
mating system, to accurately calculate eﬀective popu-
lation size, to assess levels of genetic variability (and
viability) within this population and to determine con-
nectivity between the Seychelles population and other
populations of this turtle around the world. The study
will produce important knowledge on this critically en-
dangered species that will assist with its conservation,
but the ﬁnding will also be of great general interest to
biologists and the public in general.
This work would be in collaboration with Cousine Is-
land. Permission has already been gained to undertake
sampling of this species and one year of preliminary
samples are already available for use.
Supervisor; Dr David S Richardson in collaboration
with Cousine Island
Information on the project and how to apply can be
found at:
http://biobis.bio.uea.ac.uk/Resproject/bio all.aspx
The project is a mix of molecular lab work and ﬁeld
work but the applicant must be very clear that much
of the time and basis of the study will be lab based
(Molecular DNA work in the lab). So while ﬁeld skills
are useful having molecular experience, or the desire
to work with such techniques, is more important.
The Seychelles ﬁeldwork component will be more
limited to just a few months per year. The person
must also be hard working, organized and focused on
the evolutionary aspects of the project and not just
the conservation. Although the initial goals are well
deﬁned there would be plenty of scope for the PhD
to go into new areas. In many ways it is going to be
more an evolutionary ecology project, understanding
patterns of mate choice and problems with low genetic
diversity etc, than it is going to be just a conservation
project.
Applicants should complete the application form avail-
able (see above) together with a CV and cover let-
ter within the next 2 weeks. Please mark clearly
that they are applying for a Dean’s studentship in

ChemoautotrophicEvolution
Could you please post the following ad for a PhD po-
sition (research topic: evolution of chemoautotrophic
symbioses)?
Thank you very much for your help!
Best wishes, Sharmishtha
The newly formed junior research group “Geomicro-
biology and Biosignatures in the Deep Biosphere”
headed by Dr. Sharmishtha Dattagupta in the
Courant Research Centre Geobiology at the University
of G¨ ottingen invites applications for one Ph.D. position
The CRC Geobiology (Coordinator: Prof. Reitner,
Department of Geobiology; www.uni-goettingen.de/-
crcc) is one of ﬁve interdisciplinary research cen-
tres ( www.uni-goettingen.de/crc ) recently established
by the University of G¨ ottingen as part of its institu-
tional strategy “Tradition - Innovation - Autonomy”.
Our research group focuses on the microbial ecologyand evolution of chemoautotrophic ecosystems, with
emphasis on animal-bacterial symbioses. Ecosystems
sustained by chemoautotrophy are found at deep-sea
hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and some sulﬁde-rich
limestone caves. Terrestrial sulﬁde-rich caves are easier
to access than deep-sea habitats and oﬀer an excellent
opportunity to study the interplay between geochem-
istry, microbes and macrofauna. Our primary research
ﬁeld site is the actively forming sulﬁde-rich Frasassi
cave complex of central Italy that hosts an ecosystem
sustained entirely by microbial chemoautotrophy. We
have recently discovered a symbiosis between a Frasassi-
endemic amphipod and ﬁlamentous chemoautotrophic
bacteria. Future projects will address the potential
beneﬁts of the bacterial symbionts to the amphipod
host, and examine the evolution of this symbiosis.
Candidates should hold either a Master’s degree or
a German “Diplom” in Molecular Biology, Microbial
Ecology or Geomicrobiology. Fieldwork experience is
desired. The working language of the group is English,
and applicants from abroad are encouraged to apply.
The University of G¨ ottingen seeks to increase the par-
ticipation of women in areas in which they are currently
underrepresented and therefore explicitly urges women
to apply. Disabled persons with equivalent aptitude
will be favored.
The position is initially available for two years starting
immediately and can be extended to three years fol-
lowing favorable reviews. Salary is in accordance with
the German state regulated public service salary scale
(TV-L 13).
For informal enquiries please contact sdattag@uni-

UHelsinki MarinePhylogeography
A postgraduate student position is available at the
University of Helsinki, Finland, in a project that will
address the connections between North Atlantic and
North Paciﬁc faunas.
The project will use molecular marker data for a com-
parative phylogeographic analysis of several ﬁsh and
invertebrate taxa, to assess the history of trans-Arctic
connections during the Pleistocene. The research will
address the generality of the hypothesis that the amphi-
boreal populations in the two oceans were repeatedly
reconnected by invasion events across the polar seas,
and that hybridization following such contacts of dif-
ferentiated sister lineages or taxa may have been im-
portant in determining the assembly and diversity of
current boreal communities - or will be in the future,
following the ongoing warming of polar environments.
The position is suitable for students from diverse back-
grounds, e.g. in evolutionary biology, marine biol-
ogy, invertebrate or ﬁsh biology, population genetics,
or molecular systematics. We are looking for an enthu-
siastic candidate keen to work both in the molecular

UMunich MarinePhylogeography
Munich, Germany: Research Associate (PhD) position
in phylogeography and evolution of antarctic marine
invertebrates.
We invite applications for a research associate (PhD)
position in a project funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG) - “Phylogeny of selected key taxa
of Antarctic deep-sea Porifera (Sponges) and the his-
tory of their radiation.” in the DFG Priority Program
SPP1158: “Antarctic Research in comparison with Arc-
tic Ice regions”.
The project is located in the newly established Molecu-
lar Palaeobiology Lab of the Department of Earth- and
Environmental Sciences (Chair of Palaeontology) and
the GeoBioCenterLMU of the Ludwig-Maximilians-
Universit¨ at (LMU) M¨ unchen.
Sponges play an important ecological role as active ﬁl-
ter feeders and contribute signiﬁcantly to the ﬂow of
nutrients and pelago-benthic coupling, particularly no-
table for the extraordinary rich sponge populations of
the Antarctic shelf. However, an unexpectedly high
diversity and abundance of Porifera was found in the
Antarctic dee- sea, partly exceeding those of the shelf,
but nothing is known yet about the history of coloniza-
tion, evolution, or phylogenetic relationships of South-
ern Ocean sponge communities.
In this project, we aim to resolve the systematic and
phylogenetic relationships of selected Antarctic sponge
taxa and reconstruct their phylogeographic history in
comparison with the sponge faunas of other World
oceans, mainly the Arctic. We use an integrative ap-
proach that combines molecular techniques with mor-
phological and palaeontological data to achieve an un-
derstanding of the colonisation and the history of di-
versiﬁcation of Antarctic Porifera, pivotal to assess the
potential of these fragile communities for their resilience
to global change.
This project will be carried out in close collaboration
with Dr. Dorte Janussen at the Senckenberg Research
Institute in Frankfurt (Germany).
We are seeking a highly motivated applicant with excel-24 EvolDir November 1, 2008
lent molecular- phylogenetic skills, both in the lab and
in silico, demonstrated by an above-average MSc (or
equivalent, e.g. German “Diplom”) degree in a related
ﬁeld. The working language of the group is English,
and applicants from abroad are encouraged to apply.
The successful candidate will join a young and dynamic
lab focussing on the molecular palaeobiology (micro-
and macroevolution) of marine animals. More informa-
tion about the lab can be found at <www.mol-palaeo.de
>
Requirements: Degree in Biology (MA, MSc, or equiv-
alent degree) or related ﬁeld; very good and demon-
strated knowledge of molecular lab techniques and un-
derstanding of molecular evolution including methods
to infer molecular phylogenies and state-of-the art com-
puter programs for such analyses; excellent communica-
tion and English language skills. Good working knowl-
edge of UNIX/LINUX and Perl or Python desirable but
not essential.
The position is initially available for 24 months (start-
ing from 01.01. or 01.02.2009), with possible extension
depending upon performance and availability of fund-
ing. It will be paid according to the German TV salary
scheme TV-L E13/2.
Application: Send application including letter of in-
tent, CV, PDF’s of publications, and details of 2
referees as PDF (only) by email to Mrs. Brinkrolf
(m.brinkrolf@lrz.uni-muenchen.de) . Only applications
stating the keyword “”ANTARC-POR“ in the subject

elling transgenerational inﬂuences” and is motivated by
the observation that the inheritance of developmentally
plastic responses has obvious advantages in environ-
ments where the time scale of change is greater than
generation time. Understanding these issues, and how
to incorporate this understanding into animal-breeding
strategies (another focus of the NRCGD) requires a

THREE-YEAR PHD POSITION IN PLANT EVOLU-
TIONARY BIOLOGY
A Ph.D. position in Plant Evolutionary Biology is avail-
able at the Dept. of Organismic Biology, Division ofPlant Ecology & Diversity, University of Salzburg, Aus-
tria, with Prof. Hans Peter Comes and Dr. Gunter
Fischer to study the ecology and evolution of reproduc-
tive traits in the orchid genus Bulbophyllum from the
Southwest Indian Ocean region (Madagascar, Comoros,
Mascareignes)
This research project will involve reﬁned molecular-
phylogenetic (ITS, cpDNA, single/ low-copy nuclear
genes), morphological and pollination-experimental
studies in a previously identiﬁed clade comprising c.
26 species, mainly distributed in Madagascar, but
also occurring in the remote oceanic islands of La
R´ eunion/Mauritius (Mascareignes) and the Comoros,
and on the East African continent. These analyses will
then be complemented by reconstructions (optimiza-
tions) of ancestral reproductive/ﬂoral-characters, areas
and habitat preferences in conjunction with a molecular
dating approach using paleogeological and fossil-based
calibrations. Together, this will allow us to infer how
mating types (outcrossing vs. auto-pollination), and
associated ﬂoral traits, have changed within the clade
over evolutionary time and under which spatial, tem-
poral and ecological circumstances.
The ideal applicant has a strong interest in plant evolu-
tion and a strong background in plant molecular phylo-
genetics, pollination experimental work, and statistical
analyses. As extensive ﬁeldwork in remote places of
Madagascar is required, the successful candidate must
also have a strong physical ﬁtness and experience in
conducting ﬁeldwork under tropical rainforest condi-
tions. A MSc, diploma degree or equivalent in Botany,
Ecology, Genetics or Evolutionary Biology is required.

Further details
The successful applicant will work on a NERC-funded
project to investigate the gene expression in a suite
of odorant receptor genes in populations of Atlantic
salmon.
Project Summary
Atlantic salmon are typically migratory. After a year
or more of freshwater life, juvenile Atlantic salmon un-
dergo the parr-smolt transformation (PST), a form of
metamorphosis involving behavioural, anatomical and
physiological changes necessary to survive the marine
environment. Smolts migrate to the ocean for a pe-
riod of feeding and growth before returning with a high
degree of accuracy to their natal stream as adults to
spawn. Returning ﬁsh are thought to use a variety
of orientation mechanisms to accurately navigate from
the open ocean back to the home streams within the
complex structure of large rivers. However, olfaction
and odour memory appear to be dominant mechanisms
and there may be population-speciﬁc odours in addi-
tion to environmental cues that are important for hom-
ing. Odorant receptor genes encoding molecules that
recognise and speciﬁcally bind to odours are likely to
be important elements of these mechanisms.
Samples will be collected throughout the year from ju-
veniles representing diﬀerent populations which will be
exposed to familiar and unfamiliar water sources (per-
haps containing diﬀerent speciﬁc odours). These juve-
niles have been raised in a hatchery in Scotland. We
will extract RNA from the olfactory rosette and make
ﬁrst strand cDNA. We will then use quantitative real-
time PCR to amplify the cDNA to assess the level of
expression of a suite of odorant receptor genes in each
sample.
Our aim is to test the general hypothesis that changes
in expression of odorant receptor genes expressed
in the olfactory epithelium aﬀect retention of home
stream memory in terms of odorant cues that juvenile
salmonids are exposed to during periods of enhanced
olfactory learning. We hypothesise that:
(a) populations diﬀer in the suite of OR genes that
they express, although they may possess a common
suite. (b) there are changes in OR gene expression
in individual Atlantic salmon during PST and other
sensitive periods of the juvenile life-cycle. (c) tempo-
ral variation in expression of OR genes is associated
with class of gene, with MOR genes expressed earlier
in PST than VNR genes. (d) exposure to diﬀerent sets
of population-speciﬁc odours during sensitive periods44 EvolDir November 1, 2008
induces expression of diﬀerent suites of OR genes
Job Description
The technician will work at the Institute of Zoology in
Regent’s Park, London, NW1, under the supervision

A Swiss NSF funded research assistant/technician po-
sition is available from February 1st, 2009 for a highly
organised and motivated technician or graduate with a
degree in a biological science subject.
You will work with and assist members of our lab
on a variety of projects on the evolution and ecol-
ogy of reproductive traits in plants. Currently we
work mainly on Silene latifolia and its pollinator
Hadena bicruris. Research questions include investi-
gating the eﬀects of inbreeding on reproductive suc-
cess, analysing pollen dispersal, as well as investigating
the eﬀects of interactions with pollinators for selection
on plant reproductive traits. See http://www.unil.ch/-
dee/page7005 en.html for more detailed description of
some of our projects and http://www.unil.ch/dee/-
page10687.html for pubications.
The work involves using molecular methods and exper-
imental approaches in the greenhouse, garden and ﬁeld.
Lab work involves to genotype individuals using avail-
able microsatellite DNA loci and to assist group mem-
bers with plant culturing and phenotyping (e.g. mea-
suring vegetative and ﬂoral traits).
Experience with molecular techniques (e.g. DNA ex-
traction, PCR, analysis of microsatellite DNA mark-
ers) and the ability to communicate in English with
an international team are requested. Experience with
plants and with microscopy techniques, as well as some
knowledge of French, would be an advantage but are
not essential. You will be able to work as part of a
team to develop new techniques, carry out experiments
and collect the resulting data. You will also be able
to work independently to maintain the lab’s protocols,
safety information and carry out pilot work.56 EvolDir November 1, 2008

UTrier EvolutionaryBiology
Under the auspices of the ’Zukunftsinitiative
Rheinland-Pfalz [Rheinland-Pfalz Future Initia-
tive]’, subject to ﬁnal approval, a number of posts are
available at Fachbereich VI [Department VI] of the
University of Trier (Geography and the Geosciences)November 1, 2008 EvolDir 61
in a research association in natural sciences and ju-
risprudence. The posts are open to scientiﬁc assistants
of either sex (E13 and E13/2) as from 01.01.2009, and
appointments will be made for a period of 3 years.
A number of sub-projects are to be set up in the natural
sciences with a view to studying the eﬀects of expected
climatic changes on the distribution of plant and animal
species. Here the main emphasis will be on the ques-
tion to what extent these changes have implications for
the planning of conservation areas on the national or
European level. This will involve the use and further
development of existing predictive tools for modelling
species distribution and population processes. Taking
regional climate simulations into account, both mod-
elling approaches are to be linked to selected regions.
In addition, forecasts are to be made of the eﬀects of
the expected change in land use resulting from the ex-
tended cultivation of energy plants on the propagation
of variously mobile animal species. For estimating the
exchange of individuals between populations, both di-
rect (marking experiments) and indirect methods (ge-
netic marker systems, especially microsatellites) will be
used. With the help of GIS, species speciﬁc dispersal
parameters are to be used to predict the changes in the
connectivity of the landscape for the species in question
under diﬀerent scenarios of agricultural development.
We are therefore looking for committed employees in
connection with the following sub-projects:
Sub-project 1: Modelling distribution area changes for
selected plant and animal species on diﬀerent spatial
scales (postdoctoral post, E13 100%) This position in-
volves the execution of the modelling of distribution
areas and population dynamics described above, super-
vising the scientiﬁc theses of students associated to the
project at diploma, bachelor and/or master level, as
well as coordinating the project association itself. Re-
quirements: a completed doctorate in the ﬁeld of the
modelling of population developments, preferably with
a main focus on biology. Involvement in the prepara-
tion of reports and busy publication activities are also
expected.
Subproject 2: Regional climate modelling (doctorate
position, E13 50%) The position involves the execution
of regional climate simulations for Rheinland-Pfalz us-
ing the COSMO-CLM model for climate scenarios, the
processing and evaluation of the model data, provision
of data for other subprojects and the coupling of popu-
lation models with the regional climate model. Require-
ments: A good to excellent degree (diploma or MA) in
meteorology or the environmental sciences, good pre-
sentation skills, modelling experience using meteorolog-
ical models, knowledge of programming (FORTRAN,some experience with LINUX), good understanding of
processes, a command of statistics, a capacity for work-
ing independently and for working together as part
of a team, a talent for interdisciplinary cooperation.
Also desirable or advantageous would be a knowledge
of boundary layer meteorology and SVAT modelling.
Sub-projects 3: Dispersal abilities of butterﬂies and
grasshoppers, in dependence on land use (doctoral
posts, E13 50%) and Sub-project 4: Propagation possi-
bilities of earthworms, in dependence on land use (doc-
toral posts, E13 50%) Both positions will involve the
selection and sampling of suitable geographical areas
of study, the execution of molecular-genetic laboratory
analysis and ecological work in the ﬁeld on the disper-
sal ecology of selected species. Assistance in connection
with ecological ﬁeld work is possible through supervis-
ing the theses of diploma, BA and/or MA students;
there will be the possibility of receiving intensive sup-
port in connection with the publication of the results at
international level. Requirements: a completed college
or university degree in the natural sciences, preferably
with a main focus on biology and/or the geosciences.
Applicants are expected to have knowledge and prac-
tical experience of the use of molecular-biological lab-
oratory (PCR, microsatellite analysis) and analytical
procedures (e.g. AMOVA, STRUCTURE), as well as
experience of GIS. Knowledge of species would be an
advantage, but is not absolutely essential.
The place of work will be Trier. Seriously handicapped
persons showing the right qualiﬁcations will be given
preferential treatment.

Agarose gel stains answersHello EvolDir community:
A little while back I posted a message asking for sug-
gestions for ethidium bromide alternatives. Thank you
very much to all who responded! Below you can ﬁnd a
summary of responses, followed by my original post.
It seems that most people still use ethidium bromide,
though there are a few alternatives. SYBR Safe (In-
vitrogen) and GelRed (Biotium) were by far the alter-
natives recommended most often, though there are of
course some concerns associated with each. Potential
concerns include: ˆA 1) Stability. SYBRSafe is light sen-
sitive and degrades rapidly, so you need to add it fresh
each time. SYBR Green and SYBR Gold are more sen-
sitive, but potentially more hazardous. GelRed can be
used multiple times and seems to have similar stabil-
ity to ethidium bromide. 2) Cost. SYBRSafe is more
expensive than other alternatives (though dilution may
be an option). the need to buy a diﬀerent ﬁlter for
SYBRSafe to capture optimal ﬂuorescence (or make
sure your new gel doc system comes with an appro-
priate ﬁlter). Some have had success with the standardNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 65
ethidium ﬁlter. GelRed uses the standard ﬁlter. 3)
Sensitivity. Some found a lack of sensitivity to detect
bands<20 0bp with SYBRSafe (though others did not
mention any problems). 4) Ease of use. SYBRSafe
and GelRed can be directly incorporated into the gel,
whereas SYBRGold and SYBRGreen cannot (seems to
aﬀect mobility). Also SYBRSafe should be added after
the molten gel is allowed to cool for awhile.
Other stains mentioned included SafeView (NBS Bi-
ologicals; noted as troublesome for cloning), Envision
(Amresco), GoldViewT ( http://www.sbsbio.com/-
engshiji.asp ), and Megaﬂuor (Gentaur; noted for low
sensitivity). Several people point out that anything
that binds to DNA should be treated with caution,
and some mention that the hazards of ethidium
bromide may have been overstated (see http:/-
/rrresearch.blogspot.com/2006/10/heresy-about-
ethidium-bromide.html and http://bitesizebio.com/-
2008/01/28/warning-dihydrogen-monoxide-is-worse-
than-ethidium-bromide/ Recommendations for image
capturing included Kodak, UltraLam, Eagle Eye, Bio-
Rad, BioVision 3000. Also Kris Hundertmark’s web
page on gel docs comes highly regarded by myself and
others: http://users.iab.uaf.edu/ ˜ kris hundertmark/-
Lab/Geldoc.html . Invitrogen’s blue transilluminator
was suggested a few times to avoid using UV alto-
gether. A design ﬂaw in the system allows for buﬀer to
seep in, but covering it with a sheet of acetate seems
to solve the problem.
Many people wanted to know about my super-awesome
recipe for sodium-borate (SB) buﬀer. It is from a
BioTechniques paper a few years ago“ Brody and Kern.
2004. BioTechniques 36: 214-216. I follow the recipe
as in the paper, making a 20X stock solution and di-
luting it down as needed. An insider tip: it is helpful
to use a ﬁne-grained boric acid; otherwise it will take a
long time to go into solution. As a conductive media, it
mitigates the runaway positive feedback loop between
temperature and current that occurs with Tris-based
buﬀers, thereby allowing super-fast separation of frag-
ments (without the unfortunate side-eﬀect of melting
your gel). When I experimentally tested TBE, TAE,
and SB in the lab, I found similar resolution of both
small and large products, and also calculated the cost
of SB as about one-ﬁfth that of TBE. I have used it for
routine separation and for cutting bands out of a gel.
It works ﬁne with Qiagen’s gel extraction kit” I haven’t
tried other kits.
Original post:
I have recently started a new lab and would like to ex-
plore less toxic alternatives to Ethidium Bromide stain-
ing of agarose gels. Although I am aware of SYBRSafe,I have not used it. Also, I have heard about dyes like
Crystal VU (methyl violet stain from Genlantis) that
do not require UV to visualize, but I think sensitivity
suﬀers. Thus, I would like to poll the EvolDir commu-
nity for their experiences and recommendations.
Certainly, any chemical that binds to DNA should be
handled with caution, but I am hoping to reduce tox-
icity and minimize accumulation of hazardous waste.
Cost and sensitivity are of concern, although for the
most part I am just ’checking’ genomic DNA, PCR
products, etc. Additionally, it would be convenient
if the solution could be incorporated directly into the
agarose gel (no post-staining). Also, I typically use
SB (sodium borate) buﬀer for agarose gels (a switch
from TBE or TAE that I highly recommend - lower
cost, equally eﬀective, and not exothermic like tris-
based buﬀers so you can run gels faster - but that’s
a story

Closing Kewalo Marine lab
Hi all,
The University of Hawaii is seriously considering closing
one of it’s two marine labs, Kewalo Marine Lab, where
Mark Martindale and Elaine Seaver work. Marine Labs
are like evolutionary innovations, once you lose them it
may take a very long time to get them back.
You can add to the blog on the news story at this
site: http://www.starbulletin.com/news/hawaiinews/-
20080923 Kewalo labsproposed closure protested.html
I’ve sent a message to Dr. David McClain, the Pres-
ident of the University of Hawaii System and suggest
that you send one too, if you are concerned about this
unique marine lab being closed down.
mcclain@hawaii.edu
Such a message might include the following comments:
Dear Dr. McClain,
I am writing to express my dismay over the recent de-
cision by Gary Ostrander, vice chancellor for research
and graduate education and interim director of the Pa-
ciﬁc Biosciences Research Center to close Kewalo Ma-
rine Lab.November 1, 2008 EvolDir 67
http://www.starbulletin.com/news/hawaiinews/-
20080923 Kewalo labsproposed closure protested.html
This move appears to be uninformed, considering the
importance of the world’s oceans to humans, the vast
potential of the marine environment in biological stud-
ies and current ecological problems that threaten the
unprecedented biodiversity and untapped knowledge
in the world’s oceans. Marine Labs are unique places
where most of the world’s Marine Biological Research
is conducted.
At Kewalo Marine Lab, scientiﬁc advances in genomics
and marine exploration are applied in novel and cre-
ative ways to understanding the marine environment
and biological organisms that live within it. Kewalo
Marine Lab is known world-wide for cutting edge re-
search on marine research on a variety of topics, in-
cluding coral biology, larval biology, marine ecology and
evolution. The labs have hosted many scientists over
the years, who have studied Hawaiian plants and an-
imals, contributing to the understanding of the near
shore environment in Hawaii.
I urge you to reconsider this short-sighted decision and
work with Kewalo scientists to ﬁnd a solution to keep
the marine lab open and carrying out it’s mission.
Aloha,

Evanno Method Structure
I have a question regarding the delta k method of in-
ferring the most likely k value in STRUCTURE. This
method is discussed in the paper Evanno G, S Regnaut,
J Goudet 2005. Detecting the number of clusters of in-
dividuals using the software STRUCTURE: a simula-
tion study. Mol Ecol 14: 2611-2620. Obviously, there
is no way to validate k =1. But since k = 2 is based
on prior values (in part) generated for k =1, is it also
invalid? The reason I ask is that I often get the highest
delta k value for k = 2, which for my pops makes lit-
tle sense. Intuitively, k = 2 would seem to not be able
to be validated by Evanno et al.’s method, but I need
some reinforcement for this assessment! Any input will
be appreciated.

Mac DNAFragmentAnalysis
Software
Dear all,
thanks to everybody who tried to help me. Unfortu-
nately all the software you suggested (such as 4Peaks,
Clustal or Geneious), although undoubtedly useful, are
not adequate for my needs: what I need is a software
that I can use to score size diﬀerences between alleles,
as the ones I get when using microsatellite markers, for
example. That’s why I have .fsa ﬁles, because those
are the output ﬁles produced by ABi 3130xl sequencer
when it runs diﬀerent genotypes. The only software
applications I know that do this are produced by Ap-
plied Biosystems itself (Genotyper, GeneScan and Gen-
eMapper), curiously speciﬁc to each series of sequencers
produced, so if each has a diﬀerent fragment analysis
output ﬁle, they can’t be directly used by other software
(for example, .fsa ﬁles are supported by GeneMapper
but can’t be used either in Genotyper or GeneScan),
and none of them runs on Mac OS X, although GeneS-
can was made to run on Mac OS 8.
There is also MegaBACE Genetic and Fragment Pro-
ﬁler from GE Healthcare Life Sciences, but it’s only
compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
Other than these, there’s a software called GeneMarker
(produced by a company called Softgenetics) that per-
forms the same, but again it does not run on Mac OS
X.
Regrettably, these applications are also proprietary, so
you always end up paying big bucks to have them. Un-
less, as someone pointed out, you don’t mind not using
the full features of GeneMarker and you can get away
with a free demo that can be download from Softgenet-
ics page. Not using the full features means not being
able to save the processed .fsa ﬁles, but still saving the
allele size scoring in an Excel sheet. Then again, you
can still only run it on Windows.
Finally, there is a software called STRand, that’s devel-
oped and used at at the University of California, Davis’
Veterinary Genetics Lab, and you can score microsatel-
lite alleles with it, but once again, it only runs natively
on Windows. Besides, I’ve tried it before and, without
questioning it’s usefulness, it has a very complicated,
unintuitive and unfriendly interface. And we all know
how Mac users dislike software that’s not spontaneousand straightforward...
Anyway, for the time being, I’m afraid there is no other
solution except using Parallels, Q Emulator, Bootcamp
or other application of your preference to run Windows
programmes on Macs...
I hope that this might just be the kind of incentive
that someone really creative and computer-crafty would
need to solve this issue, and make the lives of so many
researchers easier.

Microsatelliete isolation
I’m trying to ﬁnd microsatellite markers for use in relat-
edness within a population of golden-crowned sparrows
(Zonotrichia atricapilla). I can see two options - ﬁnding
heterospeciﬁc markers that work or generating species
speciﬁc markers. The former I can do myself - however
if anyone knows of markers that work in this species or
that they think are particularly likely to work in this
species, I’d love that information. The second task -
species speciﬁc markers (i.e. creating a library?) is be-
yond the skills I currently have and probably would take
more time than I can dedicate to the task. As such, I
am wondering if anyone has information on commer-
cial services that might do this for me (and maybe the
cost).
Thank you,70 EvolDir November 1, 2008

Microsatellite Libraries
The Evolutionary Genetics Core Facility (EGCF) at
Cornell University is oﬀering construction and screen-
ing of genomic DNA libraries for microsatellite loci, as
a service to the evolutionary community.
Genomic DNA is digested with two diﬀerent restric-
tion enzymes, ligated to an adapter and enriched
for SSRs by hybridization to biotinylated repetitive
oligos (dimers, trimers, and tetramers). Enriched,
double-stranded DNA is recovered by PCR, ligated to
pUC19, and ligations are used to transform E. coli cells.
Colonies containing SSRs are identiﬁed by hybridiza-
tion to radiolabeled repetitive oligos, positive inserts
are ampliﬁed by PCR, and sequenced with universal
M13 forward and reverse primers. Assembled, trimmed
contigs and original ABI ﬁles are provided to investi-
gators by e-mail. Sequences of additional clones are
available upon request.
Total cost for this service is $4300 per library, which in-
cludes all construction, screening, and guaranteed dis-
covery of 32 unique clones containing SSRs. A purchase
order and extracted genomic DNA (or tissue suitable
for extraction) is required to initiate work.
The EGCF is not a commercial enterprise, therefore li-
braries will be constructed on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve
basis. We hope to include 6-7 libraries from outside
Cornell this academic year.

Dear all,
I would like to build a hybrid tree (microsatellite data)
based on Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967) chord dis-
tance (Dc, for tree topology) and Nei’s standard dis-
tance (Ds, 1972) for branch length.
I’ve read about the possibility to construct such a hy-
brid tree with the ﬁtch-margoliash algorithm, imple-
mented in FITCH in PHYLIP.
Unfortunately, I could not ﬁnd out, how to handle that,
especially how to prepare the input ﬁle.
Does anyone know, how to use FITCH is this case, or
is there another possibility or software?

15 May 2009* for an ongoing capture-recapture pro-
gram on the Ruﬀs, *Philomachus pugnax. *The project
is under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Theunis Piersma,
head of the Animal Ecology Group of the University
of Groningen. The ﬁeldwork consists in the monitoring
colour-banded birds in Southwest Friesland, a charac-
teristic Dutch meadow area in the north of The Nether-
lands. We collect data on the timing of migration, habi-
tat use, phenotype characteristics, feeding and repro-
ductive behaviour of the birds; but you will also assist
with the banding of the birds, blood sampling, and data
entry.
Volunteers and students involved will live together in an
old church in a small and rustic village below the old sea
dyke of Lake IJsselmeer. Applicants need to have good
social skills, a driver licence, experience with handling
birds and colour-ring reading is preferred but command
of Dutch or Frisian is not necessary ;-). We provide
housing and ﬁeld equipment. Volunteers must pay own
airfare and living expenses (3-4 Euro per day). A small
refund of these costs might be possible (depending on
pending grant applications). If interested, possibility
to extent your stay to help with the ﬁeldwork for the
project on breeding ecology of the Black-tailed Godwit
(Ended around 15 June).

New Journal MitochondrialDNA
New journal launched: Mitochondrial DNA
http://www.informaworld.com/MitochondrialDNA
Since their discovery as integral parts of eukaryotic
cells, mitochondria have played a primary role in how
scientists understand the organic world. These tiny
entities are not only the “power houses” of the cell,
but they have also been a “power player” in the human
endeavor of biological study for several decades. As a
consequence, Informa Press has started a new journal
for mitochondrial DNA research called “Mitochondrial
DNA” (formerly “DNA Sequence”).
We envision the journal as a resource for the following
kinds of mitochondrial genome research:
* mapping, sequencing, and analysis of mitochondrial
DNA and RNA * descriptive studies of DNA sequences
from whole mitochondrial genomes * population genet-
ics, medical genetics, phylogenetics and human evolu-
tion that use mitochondrial DNA as a source of evi-
dence for studies * population genetics and systematics
theory that speciﬁcally address the use of mitochondrial
DNA sequences * utility of mitochondrial DNA infor-
mation in medical studies and in human evolutionary
biology * DNA barcoding studies using both empirical
approaches and theory- based critiques The centraliza-
tion of information and resources as well as a venue for
publication should serve well, that part of the scientiﬁc
community focused on mtDNA. In this context, we also
intend to present timely reviews on subjects relevant to
mitochondrial genomics, genetics and medicine. In ad-
dition, we will present a regular feature each issue called
“mito-communications” that highlight and summarize
published research or conference summaries that are
relevant to the subject of mitochondrial genomics and
genetics.
We invite submission of any manuscripts that you
or your research group might see as appropriate for
the journal. Also, suggestions for timely reviews
on subjects related to mitochondrial DNA will also
be entertained. The journal uses the Manuscript
Central System, so rapid and timely review andeditorial handling are ensured. To access journal
information and to submit a manuscript please go
to the following URLs. SUBMISSIONS: http://-
mc.manuscriptcentral.com/gdna INFORMATION:
http://www.informaworld.com/MitochondrialDNA
We hope that in creating such a journal there will be
reciprocal feedback and interaction from the various
sub-disciplines using mtDNA. For instance, we envision
this journal facilitating the incorporation of tools from,
say, mitochondrial proteomics studies to human disease
research, or from forensic studies using mtDNA to
evolutionary biology. We hope that you will enjoy and
beneﬁt from this journal.

Phist Fst comparisons
Hi.
I’m looking for a program that performs the comparison
that Spagedi (Hardy and Vekemans, 2002) does using
microsatellite data, by which it tests if the phylogenetic
information derived from allele length contributes to
the measures of population diﬀerentiation, i.e. if Rst is
larger than Fst (more explanation below). I would like
to perform this test using mitochondrial DNA sequence
data to test is PhiST is larger than Fst in my dataset.
Does anyone know of a program that does this?
Thanks in advance, Gisselle – PhD student Molec-
ular Ecology Reseach Group School of Biologi-

selle p@yahoo.com
– Extract from Hardy et al 2003 “Microsatellite Allele
Sizes: A Simple Test to Assess Their Signiﬁcance on
Genetic Diﬀerentiation”
The principle of the test is based on obtaining a dis-
tribution of a statistic under the null hypothesis that
diﬀerences in allele sizes do not contribut to population
diﬀerentiation. Therefore, we use a randomization pro-
cedure whereby the diﬀerent allele sizes observed at a
locus for a given data set ar randomly permuted among
allelic states. ($B!D(B) Under the null hypothesis, the
randomization procedure should not aﬀect the expecta-
tion of a measure of diﬀerentiation such as Rst. On the
contrary, if allele sizes contribute to genetic diﬀerenti-
ation, the Rst computed after allele size permutation
would depend solely on allele identity/nonidentity and
hence have a smaller expectation than the value com-
puted before randomization.

Reducing microsatellite stutter
paper
Hello EvolDir members, I’m trying to ﬁnd (with no
luck) the original Biotechniques paper which describesthe technique of using greatly abbreviated PCR times
(e.g. 2/2/8 s) at each step to decrease microsatellite
stutter. This technique was described in the response
of Andrew DeWoody in 2006 (see below for quoted re-
sponse) to an EvolDir member that asked about how
to decrease stutter. I do not know the complete ref-
erence of this paper, and as Andrew read the paper a
while ago he is also unsure of the reference though he
thinks the paper might be about hymenopterans. Does
anybody know the full reference of this paper or (pref-
erentially) can they email the paper as an attachment
to catherine.attard@students.mq.edu.au?
Many thanks and kind regards,
Catherine
EvolDir response: “You might try greatly abbreviated
times at each step in PCR (e.g., 2 sec denaturation,
2 sec annealing, 8 sec extension). The original paper
describing this was published in Biotechniques about 6
or 7 years ago; see also the attached reprint. [We had
cited the Biotechniques paper in the bass reprint, but
the citation was ultimately cut due to strict page limits
in PRS.] In my experience, the approach either works
very well or fails completely (on a locus by locus basis).
If you get ampliﬁcations, the stutter is usually greatly
reduced. DeWoody et al. (2000) Proc. R. Soc. Lond.
B 267:2431-2437.”

Software ATV
Other: Software announcement: A new version of the
phylogenetic tree viewer ATV has been released (ver-
sion 4.0.2). This software is available at: http://-
www.phylosoft.org/atv/ New features include: + Web-
service support: Direct reading of phylogenies from the
Tree of Life project webservices (how to use: File |Readtree from ToL... enter 2461 for Cnidarians, for exam-
ple) + Dynamic hiding of text (depending on zoom
level) + Support for the ToL Response XML Format
+ PNG, JPG, and GIF image output + ATVe: em-
bedded ATV applet (for an example go to: http://-
www.phylosoft.org/atv/examples/cnidaria.html ) + In-
teractive subtree colorization + Midpoint rooting func-
tion + Reading of zipped phyloXML ﬁles (.zip) + In-
creased rendering speed: able to handle trees with 5000
external nodes with ease, acceptable at 50000 external
nodes (dynamic hiding on, Java 6 with -Xmx256m, 3.8
GHz Pentium 4). + Various bug ﬁxes (e.g. subtree
collapsing, stays on centered when zooming in or out)
Notes. Given enough memory (-Xmx512m) (and ide-
ally Java 6 Update 10 or higher) it should be possi-
ble to display the NCBI taxonomy with 263691 exter-
nal nodes (available here: http://www.phylosoft.org/-

tire ’life on earth’ phylogeny from the Tree of
Life project with 57124 external nodes (available
here: http://www.phylosoft.org/atv/examples/data/-
tollifeonearth 1.xml.zip ) (NCBI taxonomy display is
likely to very sluggish, though).

Software Bio++
Dear EvolDir members,
We are glad to announce the release of version 1.6 of
the Bio++ libraries. Bio++ is a versatile set of C++
libraries to help with the development of applications
in the ﬁeld of sequence analysis, phylogenetics, molec-
ular evolution and population genetics. Bio++ ver-
sion 1.0 was released in 2005 and after continuous de-
velopment reached version 1.6. The libraries are fully
object-oriented, include heavy documentation, a tuto-
rial (yet under construction) and a forum for discussion
and help. They can be used on any unix/linux, mac or
windows system and are distributed as free software on
the following website:
http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/BioPP as source ﬁles or
pre-compiled libraries or packages. For linux users a de-
bian repository and a gentoo overlay are also available.
The Bio++ program suite is a set a command line pro-
grams built against the Bio++ libraries. These pro-
grams are fully inter-operable, sharing a common syn-November 1, 2008 EvolDir 75
tax, and include maximum likelihood analyses (phy-
logeny inference, ancestral rate and sequence recon-
struction, etc), distance-based phylogenetic reconstruc-
tion, sequence simulation, consensus tree building,
among others. Although originally developed for test-
ing purpose, these programs contain a set of unique
features, like: - Very large set of substitution mod-
els, including covarion models for nucleotides and pro-
teins, - ’+F’ model series for proteins, with maximum
likelihood estimation of equilibrium frequencies, - A
large set of non-homogeneous models, allowing for fully
user-deﬁned models, for nucleotides and proteins. The
Bio++programs suite is available from here:
http://home.gna.org/bppsuite/ with source code,
packages and standalone executables available for a
large variety of systems (linux, mac and windows).

Software DAMBE on LINUX
Dear All,
I just tried DAMBE on LINUX with WINE and it runs
ﬁne except for most of the DAMBE functions. The
computer I tried DAMBE on has ubuntu linux. Here is
the procedure:
1. Install Ubuntu 8.04 (I don’t know if there are newer
versions, but version 8.04 is the installation CD I have).
WINE 1.0 is automatically installed (but not enabled)
2. Click ’Applications |Add/Remove programs’, scroll
down to WINE and check the empty box to enable it.
Click OK.
3. To test WINE, run the wineﬁle ﬁle manager, i.e.,
open a terminal window and type ’wine wineﬁle’ + EN-
TER. A ﬁle manager like Windows explorer is shown.
You may notice a drive C: \.
4. Now launch your web browser
to http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/-
dambe installation instructions.asp .Right-click
DAMBEXP for Windows XP and save it (DAMB-
EXP.msi) to a directory, e.g., /tmp
5. From wineﬁle (the ﬁle manager), browse to the di-
recotry where you have downloaded DAMBEXP.msi
and double-click it to open it. Three more mouse-
clicks will have DAMBE installed to its default direc-
tory C: \program ﬁles \DAMBE.
6. To run DAMBE: From wineﬁle (the ﬁle manager),
browse to C: \program ﬁles \DAMBE and double-click
DAMBE.exe to launch it.
Minor surprises:
1. the font in the display window is not courier as I
have set it. I will ﬁnd someway to ﬁx it.
2. a few functions using Microsoft Foundation Class
functions and dialogs do not work. These include those
functions that are slow (and consequently have dialogs
to indicate progress). I will ﬁx them soon (probably by
removing the dialogs).
I was told that WINE is part of nearly all Linux distri-
butions.76 EvolDir November 1, 2008

Software Fregene
FREGENE is a C++ program that simulates sequence-
like data over large genomic regions in large diploid
populations.
Unlike coalescent-based simulation tools, FREGENE
works forwards-in-time which allows a wide range of de-
mographic and selection scenarios to be implemented.
Many such models are already incorporated into FRE-
GENE, and since it is open source users can modify or
extend these. Coalescent methods have diﬃculty incor-
porating large amounts of gene conversion or crossover,
whereas these pose no particular problem for FRE-
GENE. FREGENE oﬀers a ﬂexible model for recom-
bination hotspots, and can readily simulate regions up
to tens of Mb on a standard desktop computer.
The principle limitation of forward-in-time algorithms
is computational, since the entire population must be
tracked through time, not only the chromosomes that
are ancestral to the observed sample. FREGENE im-
plements many features to enhance computational ef-
ﬁciency, and includes a rescaling option that greatly
reduces computation time at the cost of some approxi-
mation.
The program SAMPLE, that comes with FREGENE,
generates samples of individuals from a FREGENE out-
put population, together with a phenotype that de-
pends on the genotype at one or more SNPs and may
be binary (case/control) or Gaussian. SAMPLE can
also summarize the SNP minor allele frequency (MAF)
spectrum and calculate r ^2 values for SNP pairs.

The generalized partition model covers the assumptions
of both proportional and separate edge lengths among
the data partitions, and still a few possibilities more.
Partitions can be now organized in partition groups as-
suming a separate set of edge lengths for each partition
group, but assuming proportional edge lengths within
a partition group. In a multi-gene framework, for ex-
ample, one can have a separate set of edge lengths for
every gene, and also have separate partition rates for
the codon positions.
Of course, the hypothesis testing and everything has
been updated to work with the generalized partition
model. The groupwise edge lengths can be extracted
from the reports and saved to a ﬁle.
There is a new way of dealing with calibration time
intervals: instead of optimizing the times within the
speciﬁed intervals, one can now resample them from
the intervals in a bootstrap procedure to compute con-
ﬁdence limits of divergence times, even with one sample
of edge lengths of the input tree.
Finally, I added a few more words to the TL manual.
Please note that I am still not being paid for my work
and that I had no income for years. Seems that nobody
here ﬁnds TREEFINDER worth oﬀering me a compen-
sation, a wage, a position, a perspective. Seems that I
must now change my strategy.

Solicit critics and comments
Dear All:
In 2007, I have published a paper in GENETICS ti-
tled by Gu, X (2007) Evolutionary framework for pro-
tein sequence evolution and gene pleiotropy, Genetics
175:1813-1822.
Since this paper was heavy in statistics/math, we re-
cently wrote a follow-up manuscript with much lessmath but emphasized the role of gene pleiotropy in
molecular evolution as well as preliminary data analy-
sis. This manuscript was rejected by MBE. Since many
reviewer’s questions were related to My Genetics- 2007
paper as a theoretical ground, I think it would be very
helpful to solicit any critics and comments in public.
Then, we may have a more balanced, objective discus-
sion in our revised manuscript.
Please sent your comments or critics directly to Xun Gu
at xgu@iastate.edu. Later, I will summarize all com-
ments I receive and our brief reply.
Thanks advance

SouthAfrica volunteers
EvolutionGroupLivingMammals
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution of Group-Living in small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Project: We study the evolutionary reasons of group
living, paternal care, communal nesting and social ﬂex-
ibility in the striped mouse. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working conditions
will await applicants, as the study species gets up
with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and stops its
activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during nights
might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will be done
for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able to manage
extreme temperatures (below 0 at night, sometimes
over 40C during days). Applicants must both be
prepared to live for long periods in the loneliness of
the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld; maintenance and cleaning of the research
station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-78 EvolDir November 1, 2008
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
750 (around 70 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 1500 or
140 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 250 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: Currently we are looking for two
volunteers to start in November / December, and two
volunteers to start in January. Applications for other
periods are possible as we are permanently looking for
volunteers. Volunteers are expected to stay at least 2
months, but longer periods of up to 6months are pre-
ferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch.

Working as a ﬁeld assistant in Goegap Nature Reserve
A report by Romy H¨ oppli, student at the University of
Zurich, who staid in Goegap June to August 2008
Blue skies without a single cloud for six weeks - rocky
mountains with little vegetation - yellow, orange and
pink ﬁelds of ﬂowers in whatever direction you look
- small mammals, lizards and birds in our front yard
and Mountain Zebras, Springbok and Ostrich right next
door...
This was my time at the Succulent Karoo Research Sta-
tion in Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa! Duringsix weeks from the beginning of July until the middle of
August I’ve been living here, studying mice, experienc-
ing nature like never before and being part of a small
community where there was always something to laugh
and joke about!
After arriving in Goegap, right the next morning my
scientiﬁc adventure in South Africa began: Setting and
checking traps, nest observations and radio-tracking
were our daily routine. While I got bitten by the mice
quite often in the beginning and my right middle ﬁn-
ger was scarred all over, I improved quickly shaking the
mice out of the traps, weighing them and checking the
number of the ear tag. Other duties like cleaning the
cages of the mice in the captive colony, washing the dirt
from probably several months out of the traps, paint-
ing the new Wendy House and putting in a ﬂoor and
curtains quickly added to our daily ﬁeld work activities.
It was never boring in Goegap! There was always some-
thing to do: studying the striped mouse, listening to
the interesting and funny stories every member could
tell or just enjoying the time while reading a book or
writing e-mails to friends to tell them about this unique
experience. Here, the

Spain FieldAssist SocialInsects
We are seeking two VOLUNTEER FIELD ASSIS-
TANTS, for 2-3 months starting March 2009, to
help with a social insect behavioural ecology ﬁeld
study in southern Spain. We work on an un-
usual population of paper wasps (Polistes), which
live in small colonies on cactus in Andalusia, and
the project aims to compare the direct and indi-
rect beneﬁts of helping others to breed. The work
will involve censusing behaviour, marking colonies and
carrying out video observations, providing excellent
ﬁrst-hand experience of behavioural ecology ﬁeldwork
within a thriving research group. Our proﬁle can
be found at http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/research/-
social evolution/index.html The successful applicants
must have a ﬁtness level suitable for ﬁeldwork, be pre-
pared to work hard and have an enthusiastic interest
in evolutionary biology. A driving license and at leastNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 79
one years driving experience is essential; knowledge of
Spanish would be useful but is not vital. Because the
work involves recording colour marks on individual an-
imals, the job would not be suitable for someone who
is colour-blind.
Accommodation will be in a ﬂat shared with other
members of the research group with shower, cooking
facilities, etc., and is in an attractive coastal town with
nice beach. The ﬁeld assistants will be part of a team
with one postdoctoral researcher and at least one other
researcher. Air fare (from the UK) and accommodation
expenses will be provided, so each applicant will need
to pay only their own food/personal expenses, which
are relatively cheap in Spain.
Informal enquiries should be sent to
e.leadbeater@sussex.ac.uk. Applicants must be
available for interview at Sussex University, and review
of applications will begin immediately (end October
2008) and continue until the positions are ﬁlled. Send
a covering letter and CV, including contact details
(email addresses and telephone numbers) for 2 referees.

Teaching animations simulations
Hi all,
I am wondering whether there is general interest among
the teaching community in alternative tools to teach
population genetics and evolutionary theory? It seems
that many of the ideas that we strive to explain are
very intuitive but many students have diﬃculty get-
ting past the math and jargon. I have been thinking
that Flash animations and user friendly GUI’s for some
of the emerging evolution simulation programs would
be a good complement, but before deciding whether to
commit time to this endeavour, I thought I would see
whether my feelings were more widely shared.
I would greatly appreciate any comments or ideas you
have,

Teaching animations simulations
answers
Hello Evoldir,
I sent out a message requesting feedback on whether
animations/simulations were useful for teaching popu-
lation genetics / evolutionary theory (pasted below).
I’ve received over 30 responses so far, all of which
suggested that these teaching aids would be very use-
ful along with the traditional teaching of mathemat-
ical and verbal concepts. A few people commented
that deterministic processes are often more easily un-
derstood than stochastic processes, so perhaps eﬀort
should focus there. One person noted that unless an-
imations/simulations were directed at the sources of
student misconceptions, they would be unlikely to help
much, but that if this was the case, they could be use-
ful. In general, there was lots of enthusiasm and some
very useful comments and suggestions. I have included
copies of the responses that pointed out existing tools
and have included the contact information of the re-
spondent when they were directly associated with the
development of a publicly available tool.
Many thanks to all who took the time to respond.

I saw your Evoldir posting and wanted to share some
thoughts.
First oﬀ, I ﬁnd that simulations are an absolutely in-
dispensable tool for teaching abstract concepts in pop-
ulation genetics and molecular evolution. Maybe the
concepts are not really intuitive at all, that is why all of
us spent many years studying to reach the point where
they are intuitive to us. Having students truly grasp
the ideas of dynamic processes such as drift and selec-
tion requires getting students to use teaching tools that
are themselves dynamic and also interactive.
My solution was to write a book, Population Genet-
ics, published by Wiley-Blackwell that will be available
this winter. The book is structured around numerous
“Interact boxes” that guide students through interac-
tive simulations to teach individual concepts. I also co-
authored a package of simulation programs that teach
fundamental population genetics concepts. The soft-
ware is called PopGene.S ^2 (popgenes-squared).
More details on the book can be found at my own
web page at http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/-
hamiltm1/Text book.html . The simulations will
soon be available from http://www.genedrift.org/-
popgenes.php . I also have used the “Spreadsheet ex-
ercises in ecology and evolution” book by Donovan and
Weldon for some labs. I ﬁnd the book a good resource
and I have also designed other Excel simulation. One
danger is that the students sometimes get too focused
on Excel and can miss the bigger biological points.
The Populus package by Don Alstad et al. is also very
useful for some evolution and genetics concepts and lots
of ecology concepts.November 1, 2008 EvolDir 81
There are actually some useful programs and anima-
tions out there. However, they vary a lot in quality
and interface. I would certainly encourage you to think
about new simulations and animations to help

Triploid data analysis
Dear All,
I am a PhD student working on the hybrid complex
of Pelophylax esculentus (Rana esculenta). This com-
plex consists of diploid and triploid individuals. I am
mainly working with microsatellite data and want to
perform assignment analyses, genetic diversity and dis-
tances. However, most of the software currently avail-
able cannot handle triploidy. Is there someone who
knows software that can perform assignment analyses
with a mixed diploid/triploid dataset? And how would
I best recode my data?
All answers would be helpful.
Greatly appreciated,

Triploid data analysis answers
Dear All,
I have posted the following question on evoldir:
“I am a PhD student working on the hybrid complex
of Pelophylax esculentus (Rana esculenta). This com-plex consists of diploid and triploid individuals. I am
mainly working with microsatellite data and want to

All answers would be helpful.”
Because I received a lot of emails from people with the
same problem, I will forward all the answers I have re-
ceived. This way I hope I may help somebody else. The
last email (on the bottom of this email) contained the
solution for my assignment problem.
Received answers:
Dear Griet,
I have a similar problem, but at the same time not
a very good answer to it, what I recently tried was
to use “popdist” http://genetics.agrsci.dk/ ˜ bernt/-
popgen/ with this program each allele gets its own
code and it calculates genetic distances and identity.
In my case I received a distance matrix which I in-
put into QuickTree ( http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/-
MobylePortal/portal.py?form=quicktree ) to get a tree
in New Hampshire format which then could be trans-
ferred in any tree viewing software.
I am sure this is not the most sophisticated answer and
just a try, but I would be very interested in the answer
you receive and to see how other people did it.
Best regards Marie

Two Post-doctoral positions in microbial evolutionary
genomics at Cornell University
CANDIDATES ARE INVITED TO APPLY for two
post-doctoral positions at Cornell University, both sup-
ported by a new 5-year NIH grant entitled, “Evolu-
tionary genomics and population genetics of pathogenic
streptococci.” One position will be in the laboratory of
Michael Stanhope and the other will be jointly super-
vised by Adam Siepel and Carlos Bustamante. The
Stanhope, Siepel, and Bustamante laboratories will in-
teract closely with each other and with the laboratory
of Robert Burne, a collaborator at the University of
Florida, in meeting the goals of this research project.
The bacterial genus Streptococcus includes several im-
portant human pathogens. The goal of this project
is to obtain a thorough understanding of the adap-
tive genomic diﬀerences within and between the taxa
of this genus. The project will involve the latest DNA
sequencing technologies and state-of-the-art methods
for detecting selection in both genes and noncoding
functional elements. It is expected to provide an un-
precedented level of detail on molecular adaptation and
molecular evolution for taxa of this genus. It will also
provide the ﬁrst thorough assessment of the role of lat-
eral gene transfer (LGT) and positive selection in the
diversiﬁcation of a group of closely related bacterial
taxa, as well as an improved understanding of the role
of LGT in bacterial species innovation and pathogene-
sis.
A description of each of the postdoctoral positions fol-
lows:
Laboratory of M. Stanhope: We are looking for an evo-
lutionary computational biologist, well versed in mod-
ern evolutionary biology theory, and computational
analysis, with some basic bioinformatics skills such as
R and Perl programming. An added bonus would
be knowledge of basic microbiology issues. One of
the principal roles of this person would be to con-
duct comparative evolutionary analysis of the bacte-
rial genome sequence data that we are generating using
new high throughput sequencing technologies such as
454, Solexa, and OpGen, both at the intraspeciﬁc and
interspeciﬁc levels. In addition to these analyses, thisNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 85
individual would need to collate and assemble the new
genome sequence data, as well as assist in guiding some
of the wet lab work associated with genome closing of
select strains. Salary and beneﬁts will be competitive,
as well as commensurate with the candidates level of
expertise and value to the laboratory.
Laboratories of A. Siepel and C. Bustamante: We seek
a computational biologist experienced in evolutionary
genomics and/or population genetics who will focus on
the development of novel analytical methods. Areas of
particular interest include methods for detecting non-
coding functional elements, improved methods for de-
tecting positive selection, methods for characterizing
LGT, combined phylogenetic and population genetic
methods for detecting selection, and improved meth-
ods for detecting selection in the presence of chang-
ing population sizes. The candidate will be encour-
aged to develop broadly applicable methods, but to
give special consideration to the unique opportunities
presented by the rich data generated in this project.
While methods development will be a major focus,
the candidate will also be expected to participate in
data analysis and infrastructure development. The
ideal candidate will be enthusiastic, highly motivated,
and independent, will have both a serious interest in
molecular biology and genetics and ﬁrst-rate skills in
mathematics and computing, and will have a strong

We are seeking to recruit an active scientist to play a
key role in research supporting ecosystem-based man-
agement of Australia’s coastal and marine environment.
The successful applicant will work in a team conducting
research into the management of the coastal and oﬀ-
shore waters of Australia in relation to activities such
as ﬁshing, other extractive industries, tourism, environ-
mental conservation, and urban and rural development.
The approach is based on a scientiﬁc understanding
of the functioning and dynamics of ecological systems
and the interactions of multiple human activities within
them. The work will focus on dynamic modelling of
evolutionary change under exploitative selection and
ecosystem change (as part of adaptive modelling of nat-
ural resources and the eﬀects of large scale changes
to marine ecosystems) and will integrate with existing
end-to-end (whole of system) marine ecosystem mod-
els. It requires PhD equivalent understanding of marine
ecological (or population) modelling (and the represen-
tation of genetic variation), and a solid understand-
ing of model uncertainty. Understanding of key marine
processes (such as dispersive movements, physiological
traits, and trophic and habitat-related dynamics) would
also be very useful.
This position will provide the successful applicant with
a key position within a group with an international rep-
utation in ecosystem modelling and management re-
lated science. It will also provide opportunities to play
a key role in the development of a strong program of
research within a multi-disciplinary group of about 40November 1, 2008 EvolDir 89

IFREMER France
TheoreticalGenetics
A postdoctoral position is available at the Fisheries
Unit of the French Institute for the Exploitation of the
Sea (IFREMER, Port-en-Bessin, France). The success-
ful applicant will be expected to set up new methods
to assess temporal quantitative genetic diﬀerentiation
within wild exploited populations by:
(i) developing statistical methods to estimate tempo-
ral quantitative genetic diﬀerentiation within natural
populations (temporal Qst) based on regressing (gener-
alized linear mixed models) temporal phenotypic diﬀer-
entiation on temporal diﬀerentiation at neutral markers
(temporal Fst) according to the same principle as al-
ready existing methods for spatial diﬀerentiation (Rit-
land, 2000);
(ii) extending this method to include environmental co-
variates as potentially responsible for a phenotypically
plastic component in temporal phenotypic diﬀerentia-
tion; and
(iii) applying the developed methods to two case stud-
ies: growth and maturation of North sea and Channel
cod and sole.
The position is co-funded by the European Research
Network /FinE/, /F/isheries-/in/duced /E/volution
(http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/EEP/FinE/-
Home.html ) and IFREMER. The /FinE/ project is
set up to investigate the prevalence of ﬁsheries-induced
evolutionary changes in life-history traits of exploited
ﬁsh stocks in European and North American waters.
The aims are to unravel the underlying mechanisms
of changes ranging from the phenotypic to the genetic
level, to evaluate their consequences on population and
ﬁsheries dynamics, and to provide recommendations for
evolutionarily enlightened management. This objective
necessitates the development and application of novelmethodological tools for investigating ﬁeld data both
at phenotypic and genetic levels, together with the
setup of relevant experiments on model species and the
careful construction of theoretical models suitable for
complementing ﬁeld data analyses and for evaluating
managerial options. More precisely, the present posi-
tion is intimately related to Task 2.4 of WorkPackage
2 on Genetic analysis ( http://www.iiasa.ac.at/-
Research/EEP/FinE/Tasks.html#wp2 ). The project
is coordinated by the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis (Laxenburg, Austria) and
relies on 18 teams spread in 15 European countries and
Canada.
Applicants should have a PhD in theoretical pop-
ulation/quantitative genetics or in theoretical evolu-
tionary ecology with a strong background in mod-
elling and/or theoretical statistics. Some knowledge
in life history theory and/or ﬁsh ecology and/or ﬁsh-
eries would be an advantage. According to IFRE-
MER’s fellowship rules, applicants must be less than
35 years old on December the 31 ^st , 2008, own their
PhD since less than 36 months and should not have
been employed as postdoctoral fellow by IFREMER
before. The work will be conducted within the Fish-
eries Unit (IFREMER, Port-en-Bessin, France) in col-
laboration with the two teams involved in the molec-
ular genetic work on the two case studies: the Lab-
oratory of Aquatic Ecology (Prof. F. Volckaert and

IndianaU SocialBacteriaEvolution-
aryGenomics
Post-doctoral Position in Evolutionary Genomics of So-
cial Bacteria at Indiana University
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in
the laboratory of Gregory Velicer.
The Myxobacteria are soil bacteria that exhibit highly
complex social behaviors, including social predation of
other microbes, social motility and development into
multicellular fruiting bodies in response to starvation.
We are sequencing myxobacterial genomes at multi-
ple taxonomic levels, including many strains of the
model species Myxococcus xanthus isolated from a va-
riety of local populations around the globe. In a bio-
geographically explicit context, we seek to characterize
the adaptive evolution of genomic elements involved in
myxobacterial social behavior, both within species and
between species that vary in their degree of multicellu-
lar complexity.
We seek an evolutionary computational biologist skilled
in evolutionary theory, bioinformatics and comparative
genomic analysis and familiar with current and emerg-
ing sequencing technologies. The successful candidate
will analyze patterns of selection and horizontal gene
transfer among sequenced myxobacterial genomes and
will help manage ongoing sequencing eﬀorts, including
sequence assembly and closure of some genomes. Ex-
perience in wet-lab bacterial genetics is also advanta-
geous and may allow participation in ongoing studies of
the evolutionary genetics of social adaptations in lab-
evolved lineages of M. xanthus. The successful can-
didate might also participate in ecology experiments
involving metagenomic analysis of soil microbial com-
munities.
Salary and beneﬁts will be competitive. CandidatesNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 91
should be highly motivated, independent, interactive,
and work well in collaboration with others. Applica-
tions should include a CV, a brief description of re-
search experience and interests and contact informa-
tion for three references. Please send applications and
inquiries to Gregory Velicer at gvelicer@indiana.edu.
Indiana University has outstanding researchers and re-
sources in evolutionary genomics, including the Center

InstitutPasteur Bioinformatics
A post-doctoral position is available at the Institut Pas-
teur, in the laboratory “Genomic Integration and Anal-
ysis” ( http://genopole.pasteur.fr/PF4 ).
Subject: Computational integration and analysis of
next-generation sequencing data for the characteriza-
tion of emerging infectious clones.
Research program: Next-generation sequencing (such
as Illumina GA or 454 GS FLX), implemented in popu-
lation genomic studies or genomic epidemiology, makes
it possible to sequence multiple isolates of a same mi-
crobial species. Subsequent data analysis raises new
questions, which require innovative computing strate-
gies. The successful applicant mission aims at the de-
velopment of methods and tools for handling and ana-
lyzing such data. The project is threefold: (i) the deﬁ-
nition of adequate data models (e.g. deﬁning reference
sequences), (ii) the construction of cognate databases,
associated with analysis tools and relevant query in-
terfaces (e.g. searching for polymorphic regions, an-
alyzing selection pressure, identifying genomic islands
and horizontal transfers), and (iii) the biological inter-
pretation of the data using the previously developed
tools (e.g. correlating genomic proﬁles with serological,
physiopathological or epidemiological features). These
analysis will be carried out in collaboration with sev-
eral associated labs that are running genomic typingprojects at the Institut Pasteur.
Requirements: double background in
biology+informatics (PhD degree), including ba-
sics in algorithmic, at least one programming language
(C, Perl), knowledge of database management systems
(SQL), development of web interfaces (Java), and skills
in standard methods and tools used in bioinformatics
(sequence and genome analysis) – expertise in statistics
and in microbiology would be appreciated.

Within the ERGO program of the Netherlands Orga-
nization for Scientiﬁc Research (NWO), we are looking
for an enthusiastic
POSTDOC (F/M) (38 hours) Vacancy number: 8-196
to work on the project “Plant traits constituting ecolog-
ical risks” in the section Plant Ecology of the Institute
of Biology (IBL) of Leiden University, Faculty of Sci-
ences.
The project: One of the concerns about some Geneti-
cally Modiﬁed crops is that they, or their close relatives,
become weedy. We address this question for two species
Brassica napus (Oilseed rape) and Agrostis stolonifera
(Creeping bentgrass). Both species harbour consider-
able genetic variation, have the potential to form feral
populations and modern varieties diﬀer considerably
from old ones. By measuring the survival in diﬀerent
life stages, especially the seed stage, and combining this
information in a mathematical model, we rank diﬀer-
ent genotypes for their weediness and invasive poten-
tial. We aim to show, in general, which parameters
make a species invasive and to give recommendations
with respect to the ecological risk analysis of GM crops.
Molecular and chemical analyses will be used to deducethe history of feral populations. This ERGO project at
Leiden University is part of a collaboration with the
ERGO project of the University of Amsterdam (Prof.
Van Tienderen) about ecosystem eﬀects of future GM
crops.
Postdoc position In collaboration with a technician
the postdoc will grow plants under a range of condi-
tions, will estimate demographic parameters for diﬀer-
ent genotypes and will combine this information in a
mathematical model.
The candidate should have:
0. a PhD in ecology, preferably related to life-history
theory 0. an excellent publication record 0. knowl-
edge of mathematical modelling 0. basic knowledge of
molecular techniques like AFLP 0. basic knowledge of
chemical analyses 0. suﬃcient ﬂuency in writing and
speaking English 0. a driver’s license ??? Conditions of
employment
The project is for three years. The post-doc will be
appointed on a ﬁxed term contract according to the
VSNU guidelines, depending on education and experi-
ence. The gross salary will be between 2802, and 3678,
, commensurate with experience.

POST-DOC POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY ECOL-
OGY / THEORETICAL BIOLOGY (m/f) Vacancy
number CTE-PVD-08430
Job description: The post-doc position is part of the
NWO-VICI project Adapting to a warmer world:
phenology, physiology and ﬁtness. In this project,
we study selection on phenotypic plasticity in timing
of reproduction in great tits in relation to global
climate change. There are ﬁve integrated subprojects
ranging from quantitative genetics, population dy-
namics and reproductive physiology to genomics. For
one of these subprojects we are looking for a post-
doctoral candidate. The project will be carried out
in collaboration with Prof John McNamara (Bristol,
UK, www.maths.bris.ac.uk/people/faculty/majmm/
< http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/people/faculty/-
majmm/ >).
Project description: Reaction norms of timing repro-
duction in great tits are currently under selection due
to climate change. The strength of this selection, to-
gether with the genetic variation in the mechanism un-
derlying these reaction norms, will determine the rate
of micro-evolution in reaction norms. Climate change
will lead to a new set of environmental conditions and
thus we cannot use existing data on selection to pre-
dict selection in future years. The aim of the project
is therefore to develop an annual routine model to cal-
culate the optimal reaction norm under various sets of94 EvolDir November 1, 2008
environmental conditions, based on our measurements
of the costs and ﬁtness beneﬁts of reproduction in rela-
tion to laying date. The model will be validated using
our long term (1955-present) population study on great
tits.
Requirements: We are looking for an enthusiastic can-
didate with a PhD in Evolutionary Ecology, Animal
Ecology or Theoretical Biology and with programming
skills. A limited amount of ﬁeldwork may be part of
the project. Part of the time, the candidate will be at
Bristol University.
Appointment: The appointment will be on a tempo-
rary basis for a maximum of 2 years. The gross salary
starts at EUR 2.802,- per month, scale 10.4, Collective
Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO-Nederlandse
Universiteiten), excluding 8% holiday pay and a year-
end bonus. We oﬀer an extensive package of fringe ben-

Scientiﬁc Fellowships in Portugal (1495.00/month) and
will initially be for 18 months but the successful candi-
date will be encouraged to apply for independent fund-
ing from international or Portuguese funding bodies.
The post-doc will be based at the Instituto Gulbenkian
de Cienciaˆ a (IGC, http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ )
which is a leading Research Institute in Portugal and inEurope. Researchers at the IGC work on a wide range
of subjects from epidemiology, to genetics, evolution-
ary biology, bioinformatics and theoretical immunology.
The IGC is located in Oeiras, a small sea-side town 20
min. by train from downtown Lisbon, along the Tagus.
It is only 10-15 min. walking distance from the beaches
and the quality of life is excellent. The IGC provides
excellent research conditions and English is the commu-
nication language among and within groups. Several
other research institutions are located near-by address-
ing both fundamental and applied questions in biomed-
ical sciences using interdisciplinary approaches.

RutgersU EvolutionaryModeling
Please post the following job announcement for an
opening in my lab at Rutgers University:
Applications are currently being solicited for a post-
doctoral research associate in the area of mathematical
modeling of evolutionary sociobiology and/or epidemi-
ology at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. The
lab’s research focuses on the modeling of the evolution
of sociality, studying questions of self-organizational
strategies, societal stability, organizational success, and
population robustness to disease threats. Questions ex-
plored are both theoretical and applied, and an ideal
candidate would be interested in both aspects of the
work. For further details, please see Feﬀerman’s web-
site at <http://www.math.princeton.edu/˜feferman/
>.
Requirements: - A Ph.D. in some pertinent ﬁeld. Such
ﬁelds could include, but are not limited to applied
mathematics, computer science, ecology, epidemiology,
or evolutionary biology - Some research experience in
applied mathematical modeling (within any scientiﬁc
ﬁeld would qualify) - A basic understanding of statis-
tics (can be extremely basic), or at least a willingness
to learn independently - An interest in evolutionary
socio-biology - An interest in disease and epidemics
- The ability to write clearly and scientiﬁcally (e.g.
to produce drafts of papers for publication in scien-
tiﬁc journals without too much oversight) - Ability towork/communicate with a multidisciplinary team - Ide-
ally, a candidate would have some computer program-
ming abilities, but this is not necessary - Ideally, a
candidate would have some experience mentoring un-
dergraduate level-research, but this is not necessary -
Willingness to help with the preparation of grant pro-
posals would be a plus
An ideal candidate could come from theoretical biology,
ecology, or public health, but could also come from a
program in applied mathematics, computer science, op-
erations research, bio-engineering, or nearly any other
technical ﬁeld. The lab runs jointly between The Center
for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Science and the department for Ecology, Evolution and
Natural Resources, so there exists the possibility to play
with the job title for those wishing to work in biology
for a while, but then possibly return to math or com-
puter science.
This position could be appropriate not only to new
Ph.Ds, but also to more advanced researchers looking
to switch ﬁelds, or re-enter academia from government
or industry.
This is a full-time, one year position with beneﬁts, re-
newable for an additional year if things work out well.
Ideal start date: January 2009, however this is nego-
tiable. For further questions, or to apply by sending
CV and statement of interest, send email to Nina H.
Feﬀerman at <feﬀerman ( at ) aesop.rutgers.edu >. Ap-
plications will be reviewed as they arrive.

Hi all,
I wanted to draw your attention to a postdoc op-
portunity at the Santa Fe Institute. SFI is a small,
trans-disciplinary research institution, which includes
researchers from physics, math, computer science, an-
thropology, economics, and other ﬁelds in addition to
biology. A large number of the researchers associated
with SFI have interests in evolutionary biology – and
evolution, broadly construed.98 EvolDir November 1, 2008
The Fellowships provide three years of salary plus op-
portunities to travel, bring visitors to SFI, and organize
workshops. Fellows are independent researchers, and
work on whatever most interests them, often, but not
necessarily, in collaboration with the faculty and other
Fellows.
The one caveat is that we have no wet-lab facilities, and
the research here is primarily theoretical and computa-
tional. So, if you are a theoretical or computational
evolutionary biologist, please check us out. I have at-
tached our ad text below. To ﬁnd out more about the

School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol
£30,913 The purpose of this NERC-funded project is to
investigate the genetic control and phenotypic response
of major life-history traits of the nematode Caenorhab-
ditis elegans. This builds on our previous work in this
area (Harvey et al. (2008) BMC Evolutionary Biology,

of work will (i) test for trade-oﬀs between, and local
adaptation in, dauer larva development and adult re-
production strategies of strains of C. elegans recently
isolated from the wild; (ii) select lines of C. elegans
for altered phenotypic plasticity of dauer larva develop-
ment and (iii) resolve the QTLs controlling dauer larva
development and population growth rate.
This post will be supported by a full-time technician.
This work is complemented by an associated project in
the School of Chemistry.
You will be part of a small and friendly team work-
ing on various aspects of nematode biology, within the
School of Biological Sciences whose work encompassesall aspects of biology.

Telomeres as biomarkers of costs and quality in the Sey-
chelles warbler
UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA - SCHOOL OF BI-
OLOGICAL SCIENCES
SENIOR RESEARCH ASSOCIATE Ref: RA51928,290 to 33,780 per annum (pay award pending)
A NERC funded postdoctoral position is available from
December 2008 for a period of two years and nine
months. The goal of the research is to use the unique
correlative and experimental data set compiled on the
Seychelles warblers to undertake a comprehensive lon-
gitudinal study of telomere shortening in a wild avian
population. The study will address a fundamental
problem in evolutionary biology; namely how to mea-
sure and compare the costs that individuals pay when
participating in diﬀerent activities/experiences in their
natural setting. The accurate estimation of such costs
is essential to our understanding of the trade-oﬀs in-
herent in the evolution of life histories. The work will
be undertaken with Dr David S Richardson and part-
ners involved in the overall Seychelles warbler project
(J Komdeur and T Burke) and the speciﬁc telomere
work (P Monaghan and S Verhulst).
The researcher will help to develop molecular protocols
to screen for telomere length in the Seychelles warbler.
They will then; 1) determine whether telomere shorten-
ing be used as a measure of biological aging in this wild
population, 2) investigate the relative costs, in terms of
telomere shortening, of diﬀerent stresses, and, 3) test
the idea that individual variation in telomere shorten-
ing rate can reﬂect an individuals ability to withstand
these stresses and, therefore, provide an indicator of
individual quality.
Applicants must have, or be about to obtain, a PhD
in a relevant discipline such as evolutionary or be-
havioural ecology and have a keen interest in under-
standing life history trade-oﬀs and senescence. Prac-
tical experience in modern molecular techniques, such
as PCR/sequencing, is essential. Field experience and
animal handling are desirable as there may be the op-
portunity to participate in ﬁeldwork.
Closing date: 12 GMT on 26 September 2008.

UHelsinki MarinePhylogeography
We are inviting applications for a postdoctoral posi-
tion at the University of Helsinki, Finland, to work in a
project that will address the connections between NorthAtlantic and North Paciﬁc faunas.
The project will use molecular marker data for a com-
parative phylogeographic analysis of several ﬁsh and
invertebrate taxa, to assess the history of trans-Arctic
connections during the Pleistocene. The research will
address the generality of the hypothesis that the amphi-
boreal populations in the two oceans were repeatedly
reconnected by invasion events across the polar seas,
and that hybridization following such contacts of dif-
ferentiated sister lineages or taxa may have been im-
portant in determining the assembly and diversity of
current boreal communities - or will be in the future,
following the ongoing warming of polar environments.
We are looking for an enthusiastic individual keen to
work in the molecular laboratory and curious about
exploring the signals of biogeographic history in the
genomes of marine organisms, using current tools of
data analysis. The post-doc is expected to have solid
background in DNA techniques, and good organiza-
tional skills, to assume responsibilities in molecular
marker development and in arranging sample collection,
including ﬁeldwork.
The position is in the research group of Dr. Risto Vain-
ola, based at the Finnish Museum of Natural History
and at the Molecular Ecology and Systematics labora-
tory of the University of Helsinki. The project is funded
by the Academy of Finland.
The position will be available for two years, to start
in the ﬁrst half of 2009. Deadline for applications is
November 20, 2008.

ULyon Cophylogenetics
The main objective of the project is to develop co-
cladogenesis inference methods in order to better un-
derstand how tight is the association between sym-
bionts, more speciﬁcally endosymbionts, and their
hosts. Some of the questions we wish to address are,
how often are symbionts horizontally transferred among
branches of the host phylogenetic tree, how long do
symbionts persist inside their host following the inva-
sion of a new lineage, and what processes underlie this
dynamic gain/loss equilibrium? These questions will
be addressed by applying the newly developed meth-
ods to a massive sequence dataset covering arthropod-
symbiont communities from Tahiti and three surround-
ing islands.
This work will be conducted with Marie-France
Sagot in the BAOBAB-BAMBOO teams (see http:/-
/biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr/baobab/ Biometry & Evolu-
tionary Biology lab, University of Lyon, CNRS, INRIA,
France) in very close collaboration with Sylvain Charlat
(CNRS).
The postdoc is part of a vaster project funded by the
National Research Agency on the combinatorial explo-
ration of the molecular landscape and evolution of in-
timate species relations. The position is for one year
renewable once and should start in December 2008.
The candidate is expected to have a solid training in
mathematics (combinatorics, possibly also statistics)
and / or Evolutionary biology (phylogenetics). He/she
should also enjoy team-work. Atypical proﬁles are wel-
come.

DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY AND STRUC-

Microsatellites are abundant, highly variable, repeated
DNA sequences that are regarded as the most versa-
tile genetic markers yet discovered. They are a corner-
stone of the current biological revolution and are used
in gene mapping, in DNA forensic work, and as pop-
ulation markers. Conclusions drawn from such studies
in many cases depend critically on assumptions about
how microsatellites evolve. Despite its importance, our
understanding of microsatellite evolution remains sur-
prisingly sketchy. Current models of microsatellite evo-
lution are overly simplistic and almost certainly incor-
rect, potentially leading to widespread data misinter-
pretation. In particular, genetic recombination, whilst
known to be the major generator of genomic variability,
is widely regarded as a minor contributor to microsatel-
lite evolution, if indeed it contributes at all. Here we
seek to quantify the extent and nature of microsatellite
mutation, and, for the ﬁrst time, explicitly examine therole of sexual recombination in generating microsatel-
lite variability, using near identical yeast strains that
variously do and do not engage in sex, and thus re-
combination. If, as we suspect, recombination is an
important force in microsatellite evolution, evolution-
ary models will need to be modiﬁed, potentially with
far-reaching consequences for how we analyse and in-
terpret microsatellite data and for our understanding
of trinucleotide repeat disorders, such as Fragile X and
Huntington1s disease.
Applications are invited from postdoctoral candidates
who have experience in molecular and population ge-
netics. The Department oﬀers opportunity to work in
studies using leading edge DNA technologies. The suc-
cessful candidate will have skills in molecular genetic
techniques, particularly genotyping and sequencing, be
highly skilled in analysis of genetic data and statistics,
and be self-motivated and able to work alongside a wide
variety of people.

SITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS-SUD
(FRANCE)
A 3-year postdoctoral contract funded by the French
“National Research Agency ANR” is available from
January 2009 to participate in the research project
EVOLDEEP (Evolutionary and population genomics
of deep-sea uncultivated microorganisms) coordinated
by Puriﬁcaci´ on L´ opez-Garc´ ıa. Work will be carried out

The project aims at reconstructing and comparing com-
plete genome scaﬀolds of uncultured deep-sea plank-
tonic archaea (both crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota)
from genome fragments archived in metagenomic fos-
mid libraries in our lab. The work will include the
identiﬁcation of archaeal fosmids in existing libraries
that will be completely sequenced, providing the ba-
sis for scaﬀold genome assembly. Genome scaﬀolds will
be annotated and analysed, with especial attention to
comparative analyses in order to make inferences about
the metabolism and the evolution (phylogeny, popula-
tion genomics, recombination, horizontal gene transfer)
of these uncultured archaeal lineages.
The net salary will be around 2000 euros (including so-
cial security and medical assistance) depending on the
applicant’s experience.
We are seeking motivate candidates with good experi-
ence in genome assembly, annotation and comparative

Postdoctoral research fellowship in evolutionary ge-
nomics at Uppsala University, Sweden
A postdoctoral fellowhip is available at the Department
of Evolutionary Biology at Uppsala University. The
postdoc is in the research-group of Dr. Hanna Johan-
nesson, and will focus on the evolution of the mating-
type chromosome in the ﬁlamentous ascomycete Neu-
rospora tetrasperma. The fellowhip is for one year, with
a high likelihood of extension.
Recent studies have revealed that chromosomal regions
controlling sexual identity in the fungal kingdom share
features with the more complex sex chromosomes of
algae, plants and animals. Our group have combined
gene divergence data, classical genetics and phyloge-
netics to show that the mating-type chromosome of N.
tetrasperma resemble the sex chromosomes in that re-
combination suppression involved more than one evo-
lutionary event, covers the majority of the chromosome
and is ﬂanked by distal regions with obligate crossovers.
Now, we aim at exploring the system further by using
a bioinformatics and/or a molecular biology approach.
This postdoc project can be developed after the inter-
est of the applicant, and could involve revealing struc-
tural or autosomal gene inﬂuence on the recombination
block, and the evolutionary history of the chromosome
in diﬀerent phylogenetic lineages of the species.
The Program in Evolutionary Biology ( http://-
www.egs.uu.se/evbiol/ index.html) is situated in the
Evolutionary Biology Centre in central Uppsala. The
working atmosphere is international with English as
working language. The Evolutionary Biology Centre
constitutes an exciting arena for multidisciplinary re-
search in evolutionary biology in a broad sense, with re-
search programs including ecology, systematics, genet-
ics, genomics, and developmental biology. Uppsala Uni-
versity is the oldest university in Scandinavia and the
city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town with beauti-
ful surroundings conveniently situated 40 minutes with
train from Stockholm.
Required qualiﬁcations for applicants are 1) a PhD in
Biology, Genetics, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology,
or related ﬁeld, 2) experience in one or several of the fol-
lowing areas: molecular biology, bioinformatics, popu-
lation genetics, evolutionary biology, genetics, microbi-
ology, mycology, and 3) demonstrated verbal and writ-November 1, 2008 EvolDir 109

StatisticalPhylogeography
Course Advertisement:
Statistical Phylogeography course at the AMNH South-
western Research Station near Portal, New Mexico.
This course will cover several advanced topics in sta-
tistical approaches to the analysis of phylogeographic
data, including those based on Monte Carlo simulations
and parametric bootstrapping, approximate bayesian
computation, various power analyses, and approaches
to estimating species trees from gene trees. Participants
will be asked to bring their own data to the course, and
the design and implementation of analyses for individ-
ual data sets will be emphasized. To facilitate these
analyses, students will learn some basics of UNIX and
R.
Course requirements: participants must bring a lap-
top computer running either Mac OSX or Linux op-
erating systems. We suggest that participants install
R and perl prior to arrival, as well as several other
open source programs (such as ms, seq-gen, msBayes,
MrBayes, and Mesquite). Participants will have ac-
cess to wireless internet at the SWRS, and will be en-
couraged to conduct analyses remotely on servers at
their universities. People who are interested in attend-
ing this class should send a brief letter and a CV to
swrs.statistical.phylogeography <at>gmail.com by De-
cember 15th, 2008.

PlantHomology Jan16-18
The NSF Molecular and Organismal Research in Plant
History (MORPH) Research Coordination Network
is hosting a workshop/minicourse titled, “Homology:
Conceptual and Historical Integration from the Mor-
phological to the Molecular” at the University of Col-
orado, Boulder from January 16th-18th, 2009.
This intensive workshop and minicourse will provide an
opportunity for a select group of doctoral students andNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 113
distinguished investigators in plant evolutionary devel-
opmental biology to interact. The goal will be to ad-
dress conceptual hurdles associated with the analysis of
homology. In particular, participants will focus on the
integration of molecular, organismic, and phylogenetic
data to address long standing questions of homology
in plants. Each participant will outline critical issues
associated with his/her evolutionary developmental re-
search program and there will be extensive discussion.
MORPH will cover all travel costs for a select group of
doctoral students. The application deadline is Novem-
ber 13th, 2008. For applications and more details,
please see http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/MORPH/-

Estimating Species Trees: a Phylogenetic Paradigm for
the 21st Century
Recent computational and modeling advances have pro-
duced methods for estimating species trees directly. Ac-
curate estimates of phylogenetic relationships can be
extracted from genetic data with these new approaches,
sometimes with less data, by directly modeling the
causes of discordance in topology and branch lengths
among gene trees. Such inferences are commonly im-
possible under the traditional phylogenetic paradigm
because of the potential for the idiosyncrasies of gene
trees to obscure the actual history of species divergence.We are oﬀering this workshop to not only increase the
visibility and use of these methods, but also address a
number of signiﬁcant challenges to estimating species
trees, to assure that the advantages these methods of-
fer reach a broad community of users. The goals of the
workshop are to: (i) provide an understanding of the
theoretical underpinnings of current methodology, (ii)
present empirical examples demonstrating the utility of
current methodology as well as its limitations, and (iii)
oﬀer instruction on the technical aspects involved in us-
ing current software. This will be accomplished through
the combination of a series of lectures (day one) and
hands-on computer training (day two). Participation
in the workshop requires registration (go to http://-
www.ummz.lsa.umich.edu/sptree.html ) and is free for
those attending the lectures (on Jan 10) and is $25 for
those attending the computer training (on Jan 11; see
website for programs that will be covered). To facili-
tate broad and diverse participation in this important
workshop, funding is available to oﬀset transportation
and lodging costs (i.e., $500 for those from the US and
$1000 for international participants - see website for
details on how to apply).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not includeNovember 1, 2008 EvolDir 115
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
