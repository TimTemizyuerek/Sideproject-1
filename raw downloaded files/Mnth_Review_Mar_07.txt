May31-Jun2
Dear colleague!
The Gregor-Mendel-Network, an association aimed at
promoting computational biology in infrastructure, sci-
ence and education in the Vienna-Brno area, organizes
its ﬁrst meeting (31st May - 2nd June 2007). It will
take place in Brno in the premises of the abbey where
Gregor Mendel has carried out his famous experiments.
The selected topics for this year are the ﬁelds of
biomolecular sequence analysis (gene function pre-
diction), comparative genomics (evolutionary studies
based on completely sequenced genomes) and 3D struc-
tural analysis (biomolecules in context with drugs).
The event involves advanced tutorials (including lec-
tures and practical exercises) and scientiﬁc lectures.
The latter are thought to extend the tutorial part and
to present front edges of research that can be reached
with the theoretical approaches in the res- pective
ﬁelds. More detail is available at the conference WWW
site ( http://gmn.imp.ac.at/conference2007.shtml )
The expected audience will involve qualiﬁed young sci-
entists (from various biological labs) that wish to com-
plement their skills in com- putational biology in addi-
tion to scientists from the region.
We would be happy to have you with us in Brno at
the conference. With kind regards (also in the name of
Arndt von Haeseler and Jaroslav Koca),

SYMPOSIUM ON Fish Hybridization and Introgres-
sion - Evolutionary and Conservation Approaches
The role of hybridisation in evolution throughout exten-
sive gene ﬂow and the establishment of new evolution-
ary lineages is now becoming increasingly clear by the
new insights of molecular genetics and ecology of hy-
brids (from both genetically divergent populations and
species). Moreover, hybridization also has important
implications for management and conservation, once it
is well known that human activities such as stock trans-
fer and exploitation, habitat changes and interaction
with alien species all act to increase the incidence of
hybridization among populations and species and af-
fect the survival of indigenous populations.
In this symposium, we plan to bring together experts
from a variety of disciplines including genetics, mor-
phology, behavior and ecology, management and con-
servation, to review recent knowledge about the im-
pacts of hybridization on ﬁshes. Topics for discussion
will include:
i) detection of hybridization using molecular and mor-
phological tools;
ii) hybrid (tension) zones;
iii) case-studies linking the genetics of hybridization
and introgression with the ﬁtness performance of hy-
brids and parentals;
iv) role of hybridization in speciation (in both homo-
ploid and polyploid conditions);
v) evolutionary aspects of sexual versus non-sexual
modes of reproduction;
vi) strategies for preserving the genetic integrity of na-
tive species;
vii) impact of hybridization on endangered species,
management decisions and legislation.

CONFERENCE WEBSITE
https://smbe2007.dal.ca/ Program outline
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) is pleased to make available 10 awards for
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups
to participate in a Diversity Mentoring Program. The
goals of this program are: (1) to promote diversity at
the SMBE annual meeting, (2) to provide students with
the opportunity to experience the excitement of attend-March 1, 2007 EvolDir 7
ing and presenting at an international scientiﬁc confer-
ence, and (3) to foster enthusiasm for molecular biology
and evolution as well as a possible career in this ﬁeld.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Diversity Mentoring Program Award will
be paired with two mentors, one a senior graduate stu-
dent and the other a postdoctoral fellow or faculty
member (who may or may not be the student?s current
advisor). Speciﬁc mentoring activities will include:
? Attending conference sessions with the student, an-
swering questions about the basic concepts being pre-
sented, and, more generally, explaining the ?goings-on?
at a multi-day scientiﬁc conference.
? Interacting with the student during some mealtimes,
coﬀee breaks and other social gatherings.
? Introducing the student to other undergraduates,
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty
members as a way of facilitating connections with po-
tential future graduate supervisors and colleagues.
? Attending the poster session and SBME Undergrad-
uate Diversity Program Award reception with the stu-
dent in order to minimize/overcome the anxiety often
felt by ﬁrst-time conference attendees.
? Serving as a contact point for the student to help
resolve any issues surrounding conference registration,
travel and accommodation.
Eligibility
Candidates must currently be enrolled as undergradu-
ate students (Bachelor’s level degree) or have graduated
within the last 6 months at the time of application and
be from groups underrepresented in our scientiﬁc disci-
pline (e.g., minority groups and/or women).
Selection
Ten individuals will be chosen to receive the award and
participate in the program on the basis of their submit-
ted abstracts (below).
Conference participation
Recipients of an SMBE Undergraduate Diversity Men-
toring Program Award will be invited to present their
research at a special poster session on the evening of
Monday, June 25. Awardees will also attend a recep-
tion to be held in their honor, along with their mentors
and other interested conference attendees.
Award
Award recipients will receive US $1,000 to be used to
help cover the cost of airfare, accommodations, and
meeting registration. Each participant will also receive
an online student membership to the Society journal,Molecular Biology and Evolution, for the year of 2008.
Application
Faculty members will be responsible for nominating
undergraduates. A brief letter/email of recommenda-
tion outlining the student?s eligibility for the award
and conﬁrming their current academic status should
be sent to Laura Katz (Lkatz[at]email.smith.edu) and
John Archibald (jmarchib[at]dal.ca).

MechanismsofGenomeEvolution Jul
Conference organized by Michael Lynch and Eva Allen.
The availability of genome-sequence data has forever
transformed our ability to understand the molecular
basis of the evolutionary process, but it also remains
true that the mechanisms of evolutionary change ul-
timately reside at the population-genetic level. Thus,
the goal of this conference is to help bring about a syn-
thesis of our understanding of genomic evolution from
the standpoint of both population genetics and molec-
ular biology, and to outline the major challenges to the
transformation of the descriptive ﬁeld of comparative
genomics into an explanatory ﬁeld of evolutionary ge-
nomics. The meeting will consist talks, and poster and
discussion sessions to encourage broad participation.
Funds will be made available, on a competitive basis,
to defray the costs of student registration.

Upcoming beginner level workshop on Quantitative
Methods in Population Dynamics at University of theMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 9
Aegean, Mytilene, Greece, 11-15 June 2007 (see at-
tached ﬁle).
You are hereby cordially invited to take part in the fol-
lowing workshop:
Quantitative Methods in Population Dynamics http:/-
/www.aegean.gr/environment/popdyn2007/ http://-
www.cefe.cnrs.fr/biom/Workshop/QMPD2007.htm
This workshop will deal with the analysis and mod-
elling of population dynamics. The content is aimed
at providing the participants with a solid background
in the philosophy, theory and practice for the analy-
sis of data. We will cover population projection ma-
trix models, the estimation of demographic parameters
(survival, recruitment, dispersal and growth rate) using
capture-recapture models and the estimation of popu-
lation densities and abundance using capture-recapture
and distance sampling models. Finally, we will re-
view recent advances in the combination of those diﬀer-
ent sources of information (Integrated Population Mod-
elling). The format of the workshop will be a com-
bination of lectures and computer sessions with pro-
grams ULM, M-SURGE & U-CARE, DISTANCE and
MARK. It is our hope that participants will bring their
own data to work on during the workshop. All lectures
and course material will be in English.
Teachers: Olivier Gimenez, Jean-Dominique Lebreton,
Roger Pradel (CNRS/CEFE, FRANCE) and Panagio-
tis Besbeas.
The registration fee for the workshop is 360 euros (180
euros for students). Check the websites for details on
how to apply.

Dear Drosophila Researcher,
For those of you attending the 47th Annual Drosophila
Research Conference in Philadelphia, we want to call
your attention to a workshop entitled “A Dozen Fly
Genomes: What Have We Learned and What’s Next?,
which will take place on Friday, March 9, from 1:45pm-
3:45pm. ˆAThe goal of this workshop is to reﬂect on
what we have learned thus far as a way of determin-
ing future genome scale resource needs to advance our
understanding of genome organization and evolution in10 EvolDir March 1, 2007
the genus Drosophila.
For example, some of the resource questions we will ask
are:
”What are our needs in terms of:
a. Assembly improvements/ﬁxes on the dozen ﬂies?
b. Sequencing multiple strains of a single species?
c. Sequencing additional species?
d. Expression resources such as transcriptome and
genome
tiling arrays, SAGE, proteomics surveys, comparative
in situ studies.
e. Forward and reverse genetic tools¿‘
We encourage you to contact us if you are interested
in making a short presentation or if there are speciﬁc
topics that you would like to see discussed. ˆAWe hope
that much of the time of this workshop will be reserved
for an open forum amongst the participants.
For those of you who will be unable to attend, we would
be pleased to hear your thoughts about discussion top-
ics as well as future resource needs.
We look forward to seeing you in Philadelphia.

events/bwb07.php As we try to increase our under-
standing of biology, the focus of research is shifting from
parts to systems. This shift brings with itself a blending
of tools, scientiﬁc ﬁelds, expertise, and people in order
to properly address the new challenges that arise.
?Biology without Borders? recognizes such shift andaims to embrace it with a unique open format. Its
focus will be theoretical and experimental approaches
which are allowing a more complete and system level
understanding of biology and which recognize the im-
portance of evolution for achieving such understanding.
Expected attendees are scientists with such a research
agenda, irrespective of the tools they use or their back-
ground. The scientiﬁc exchange in this highly inter-
disciplinary setting will be catalyzed by the following
invited speakers:
Sebastian Bonhoeﬀer, ETH Nicolas Buchler, Rock-
efeller University Wolfgang Marwan, MPI Michael
Stumpf, Imperial College London Michael Laub, MIT
Stas Shvartsman, Princeton Leah Cowen, University
of Toronto Richard Lenski, Michigan State Univer-
sity Sarah Teichmann, MRC Francois Taddei, INSERM
Uwe Sauer, ETH Doris Bachtrog, UCSD Dan Anders-
son*, Uppsala University Michael Elowitz*, Cal. Inst.
of Technology Andreas Wagner*, Uni. Zurich *to be
conﬁrmed.
A blend of conference and workshop, ?Biology with-
out Borders? is intended to provide the right stage to
interact and discuss. Organized by the Microsoft Re-
search ? University of Trento Centre for Computational
and Systems Biology (CoSBi), the meeting found the
perfect setting for such stage in the beautiful medieval
town of Trento, Italy. Over two full and two half days,
participants will attend 30 talks in 6 sessions. After-
noons will be open, featuring small walks in and around
Trento to refresh the mind. To enhance the quality of
discussion and interaction, attendance will be limited
to 60, including selected and invited speakers.
Interested participants should apply with the abstract
of the intended presentation or a short description
of research interests. Deadline for applications is 31
May 2007. Conference details and application forms

“Managing the eﬀects of the spatiotemporal spread of
harmful species in ecosystems: The Integration of The-
oretical and Empirical Approaches”
March 12-16, 2007 University of Guelph Arboretum
Workshop details:
As part of the Environmental Science Research Initia-
tive funded by the Faculty of Environmental Science, a
weeklong interdisciplinary workshop will present cur-
rent progress in theoretical and empirical-based ap-proaches aimed at determining, predicting, and man-
aging the eﬀects of the spatiotemporal spread of po-
tentially harmful species in ecosystems that have be-
come susceptible to invasion because of external stresses
(hereafter, at-risk ecosystems). The appeal of the
broad scope of the workshop theme is evident by the
wide range of research that will be presented during
the workshop. A group of esteemed scientists led by
keynote speaker Dr. Mark Lewis, from the University
of Alberta, Dr. Marie-Jos´ ee Fortin, from the University
of Toronto, Dr. Fr´ ed´ eric Guichard, from McGill Univer-
sity, and Dr. Brian Maurer, from Michigan State Uni-
versity, will present research based within the frame-
work of the workshop theme. In addition, a number of
scientists from a wide-range of disciplines will attend
and give seminars throughout the weeklong workshop,
which will add insight into strengthening previous the-
oretical and empirical work aimed at managing at-risk
ecosystems.
Workshop goals:
To provide a forum that generates collaborations among
on-campus and oﬀ-campus scientists from the life sci-
ences, physical sciences, and social sciences interested in
determining, predicting, and managing the eﬀects of the
spatiotemporal spread of potentially harmful species in
at-risk ecosystems
To use current and future research presented at the
workshop to develop sound management strategies
aimed at protecting at-risk ecosystems whose conser-
vation may impact the economic needs of societies
To use the workshop as a springboard for future devel-
opment of theoretical and empirical research projects
in Canada and abroad
To provide an environment where students at the Uni-
versity of Guelph, and students from surrounding uni-
versities are exposed to scientiﬁc research that they
would not normally encounter in their coursework.
Call for contributed talks:
For those of you who wish to contribute a talk dur-
ing the workshop proceedings, please specify a date
and time based on the tentative agenda outlined in the
workshop advertisement (time slots contributed talks).
Instructions for those interested in contributing a talk
can be found on the pre-registration form (a link to

International Conference Announcement:
’Origin And Evolution Of Biota In Mediterranean Cli-
mate Zones: An Integrative Vision’
Webpage for registration and additional informa-
tion http://www.systbot.unizh.ch/mediterranean/-
index.htm July 14-15, 2007, University of Zurich,
Switzerland
Conference language: English
Understanding the biotic and abiotic processes that
contribute to high species numbers in biodiversity ’hot
spots’ is one of the major tasks of biology. The ex-
ceptional biological richness of the ﬁve Mediterranean
climate zones of the earth - the Mediterranean basin,
South Africa, Australia, Chile and California - makes
them an ideal case study to investigate the evolutionary
and ecological dynamics that generate elevated species
numbers. By focusing on the Mediterranean basin, the
conference will synthesize the current state of knowl-
edge on the origin of mediterranean biota, while chart-
ing a map for pushing the frontier of conceptual and
methodological advances in biodiversity studies. The
goal of the conference is to clarify the history of bi-
otic assembly in mediterranean climate zones by inte-
grating evidence across multiple disciplines, including
evolutionary biology, systematics, ecology, paleontol-
ogy, paleoclimatology, and paleogeology.

Adelaide Australia 2 AncientDNA
Two PhD opportunities currently exist at the Aus-
tralian Centre for Ancient DNA, in Adelaide, Australia:
Research in permafrost areas of northern Canada, and
the ’hobbit’ site of Liang Bua, Flores.
Ancient DNA studies of permafrost-preserved ecosys-
tems across a complete glacial cycle.
The Yukon Territory (northwestern Canada) preserves
a unique frozen record of plants, animals and microbes
dating from more than 130 kyr to the modern day. This
time span covers the last glacial cycle from the Last
Interglacial warm period 130 kyr, through to the last
glacial maximum around 20kyr, and onto the Holocene.
The frozen biotic remains record the migrations, ex-
tinctions and evolution of various organisms during
this period in the arctic refugium of Beringia, and al-
low a detailed real-time investigation of ecosystem re-
sponses to climate change. Ancient DNA will be used
to record the changes in genetic diversity, heterozygos-
ity and speciation events that have taken place as a re-
sult of these events, allowing many evolutionary mod-
els and processes to be examined. The research will
concentrate on plant records, including the large num-
bers of frozen seeds, fruits and leaves (plant macrofos-
sils) recovered from sub-fossil ground squirrel burrows
throughout the area. Other exceptional remains recov-
ered from frozen contexts include buried, in situ sub-
fossil vegetation, mammalian coprolites (faeces) and pa-
leosols. The project will be performed with leading
Quaternary scientists from Canada (Dr G. Zazula and
Prof. D. Froese) and members of ACAD, and will in-
volve ﬁeldwork in remote areas, and challenging lab-
oratory work. This research will be integrated with
ongoing Quaternary geological and multi-proxy pale-
oenvironmental research in the region. This project is
available to international graduate students with strong
research and/or publication records.Contact: Prof. Alan Cooper, Australian Centre

www.yukonheritage.com Genetic analyses of the
paleoecology of the Homo ﬂoresiensis site of Liang
Bua, Flores
The cave site of Liang Bua, western Flores records the
only known specimens of Homo ﬂoresiensis, informally
known as ’hobbits’. This project will use ancient DNA
to examine the paleoecology of the site through plant
and animal DNA preserved in sediments (cave, terrace
and lake), skeletal remains, on stone tools, and in other
records such as speleothems. The ancient DNA records
oﬀer a new approach to studying the diversity and com-
position of local Flores plant communities through time
and, hence, the prevailing climatic and environmental
conditions. These will be directly compared to estab-
lished rainfall records inferred from stable isotope anal-
ysis of speleothems, and used to reconstruct the cli-
mates and environments of western Flores. These re-
constructions will identify periods of extreme or abrupt
environmental change or major environmental turning
points, such as rainforest expansion and contraction
and changes in ﬂoral composition and diversity, which
may have inﬂuenced the course of faunal (and human)
evolution, dispersals and extinctions. The project is
part of a largescale Quaternary dating and landscape
evolution analysis performed by Dr Kira Westaway and
Prof. Mike Morwood at the University of Wollongong,
in collaboration with archaeological investigations per-
formed by Indonesian archaeologists from ARKENAS,
Jakarta. The ancient DNA research will involve both
ﬁeldwork at the site, and challenging laboratory re-
search at ACAD. This project is available to interna-
tional graduate students with strong research and/or
publication records.

ies (CEES), Groningen, has a vacancy for a full-time
PhD position:
PhD Project title: Inﬂuence of sex-speciﬁc competition
and density on demography in the great tit
We are looking for a PhD student to study how com-
petition explains the distribution, survival and repro-
ductive rates in great tits. The PhD position is part
of a unique large-scale project where we manipulate
diﬀerent aspects of competition (ﬂedgling density and
ﬂedgling sex ratio) to study ﬁtness consequences of
competition and avian sex allocation.
Parents should invest equally in the two oﬀspring sexes
and hence adjust the sex ratio of their oﬀspring to both
the ﬁtness costs and beneﬁts of producing them. In this
project we started to measure whether ﬁtness beneﬁts
of producing a particular sex ratio dependent on the sex
ratio in the population and whether parents adjust their
reproductive decision to that. Two current projects (to
be continued for one year) focus on the experimental
eﬀects of 1) ﬂedgling density on the costs and beneﬁts
of brood size and 2) ﬂedgling sex ratio on the ﬁtness of
the sexes.
We ﬁnd promising results in the ﬁrst experimental
years: some plots have consistent low or high natural
breeding densities, and reproductive investment and sex
ratio are correlated with this breeding density. So far,
experimental changes in ﬂedging sex ratio did not aﬀect
reproductive investment and sex allocation decisions of
the parents. Sex-speciﬁc and density dependent disper-
sal neutralized the eﬀect of our experimental sex ratio
skew and density manipulation in the next breeding
season. Therefore, the aim of the new projects is to ex-
perimentally alter sex speciﬁc competition and density
just before breeding by selective removal of breeders.
The questions are:
1) Do breeders adjust sex ratio of their oﬀspring to
skewed breeder sex ratio?
2) Do breeders adjust clutch size of their oﬀspring to
manipulated breeder density?
3) Are these changes adaptive?
4) How is settlement of the new generation aﬀected by
(sex speciﬁc) breeder removal?
To judge how optimal brood size and sex ratio de-
pend on breeder density we will manipulate oﬀspring
brood size and sex ratio. The work of the PhD will
concentrate on the oﬀspring side (starting manipula-
tions in 2008) while the joint project will concentrate
on parental decisions (starting manipulation in spring
2009). We oﬀer a stimulating working atmosphere, with
ample opportunity for discussion and with top-qualityscience.
Requirements
Candidates must have a degree in biology, with speciali-
sation in ecology, and a driver???s license. We are look-
ing for an enthusiast researcher with ample experience
in ﬁeld research on birds. Theoretical interest in evolu-
tionary ecological research is a prerequisite; knowledge
of database management in Access is an advantage.
Conditions
The University of Groningen oﬀers an appointment for
a period of four years that should be completed with
the defence of a PhD-dissertation. During the ﬁrst year
the stipend is ??? 1905,- for a Dutch student and ???
1422,- per month for a foreign student (stipend lower
than that for a Dutch student because of tax exemp-
tion) and will be adjusted to general price movements
once a year. After one year, the performance of the
candidate will be evaluated to decide whether there is
suﬃcient progress to expect a successful completion of
the PhD thesis within the remaining three years. A
training programme is part of the agreement. You and
your supervisor will make up a plan for the additional
education and supervising that you speciﬁcally need.
Background
This PhD project is part of a large research grant on
Sex-speciﬁc reproductive tactics: ﬁtness consequences
of avian sex allocation and dispersal strategies granted
to Prof. dr. ir. J. Komdeur by the Dutch Organisation
of Scientiﬁc research. The research will take place in
the ???Animal Ecology??? research group. You will be
supervised by Prof. dr. J.M. Tinbergen and Prof. dr.

Modelling the environmental and ecological drivers of
disease emergence in amphibian chytridiomycosis.
Amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Ba-
trachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is now known to be
one of the most potent threats to biodiversity yet dis-
covered. This project will work with a NERC-funded
team at Imperial College and the Zoological Society of
London to analyse the dynamics of disease transmission
within Europe by developing epidemiological models of
the chytrid and its amphibian hosts.
The disease dynamics that we observe from our mod-
els will allow us to determine the likely eﬀect of dif-
ferent biotic and abiotic reservoirs, the inﬂuence of
individual-level heterogeneity in transmission and the
likelihood of survival of diﬀerent host species with dif-
fering susceptibility and life history. While these mod-
els will be developed to describe single-site situations,
we will subsequently investigate whether there are any
spatial components to the disease dynamics by estab-
lishing sub-population connectivities between sites and
utilising metapopulation models.
The student will further reﬁne statistical models that
we are developing in order to determine factors that
are associated with prevalence of infection and mortal-
ity across several spatial scales. Ecological regression
models will be used to derive predictions of geographic
sites that are most at risk of disease emergence due to
the presence of a Bd - favourable ecology. Environmen-
tal forcing of Bd transmission dynamics will then be
incorporated into our mathematical models to examine
the impact on patterns of mortality across the amphib-
ian communities in diﬀerent locations. Ultimately, we
will use existing climate models for Europe to assess the
likely implications of future trends of climate-change
on the evolutionary dynamics of infection within areas
where our surveillance has identiﬁed endemic infection.
All students will belong to the Graduate School of Life
Sciences and Medicine which provides a full programme20 EvolDir March 1, 2007

The molecular epidemiology and evolution of emerging
human pathogenic fungi
Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii causes a com-
mon and often fatal infection in AIDS patients, despite
antifungal therapy. In northeast Thailand, cryptococ-
cal disease is second only to tuberculosis as an AIDS-
deﬁning illness, while in many areas of Sub-Saharan
Africa C. neoformans is now the commonest cause of
adult meningitis. Heterogeneity occurs in the response
of patients to infection by C. neoformans and recent
studies have shown that the genotype of the infect-
ing strain is predictive of its virulence. The key goal
of this project is to apply a newly developed genetic
tool to analyse the molecular epidemiology and evolu-
tion of natural populations of C. neoformans, Multilo-
cus Sequence typing (MLST). We will use this tool toperform an in-depth analysis of C. neoformans strains
that cause disease within AIDS patients in southeast
Asia and Africa. This analysis will have four aims: (1)
we will statistically test whether there is an associa-
tion between Sequence Type (ST) and disease progres-
sion/outcome in patients suﬀering from AIDS; (2) we
will assess the relative frequencies of STs between clini-
cal and environmental strains in order to identify stains
that are diﬀerentially associated with infection, and are
therefore candidate isolates with high virulence; (3) we
will use quantitative genetics to test whether ST is cor-
related with clinically-relevant phenotypes in the lab-
oratory, by measuring natural variation in genetically
determined traits using morphometric and microarray
analyses and (4) we will investigate whether there is an
association between ST and virulence using cell-culture
and mouse models. Identifying the genetic basis of vir-
ulence in Cryptococcus will allow us to better describe
host-level infection parameters, thus enabling us to de-
velop a predictive biology for human cryptococcal in-
fection. Further, the development of MLST as a tool
will allow us to ascertain whether there is variation be-
tween geographical regions in the severity of infection,
to what extent genotype accounts for regional varia-
tion, and what evolutionary mechanisms are likely to
be governing virulence in this widespread and impor-
tant pathogen.
All students will belong to the Graduate School of
Life Sciences and Medicine which provides a full pro-
gramme of training in research and transferable skills.
Students will be based in the Department of Infec-
tious Disease in the Division of Epidemiology, Public

We are currently looking for a Ph.D. candidate start-
ing in May 2007 that would be involved in our ongoing
research program aiming at evaluating the evolution-
ary consequences of stocking practices in the salmonid
Salvelinus fontinalis (Brook charr). The main objective
is to evaluate the level of genetic contamination (intro-
gressive hybridization) in wild populations by means of
both molecular genetics, functional genomics (microar-
rays) and phenotypic analyses. These patterns of vari-
ation will be put in relation with the history of stocking
and the heterogeneity of environmental variables that
may potentially inﬂuence the impact of stocking. This
research will lead to develop a unique method for doc-
umenting and predicting the biological and economical
impacts of stocking salmonids. This multidisciplinary
project is a collaboration between Louis Bernatchez
(Universite Laval) and Dany Garant (Universite de
Sherbrooke) and is funded by NSERC Canada.
We are primarily looking for a student with strong lab-
oratory skills and expertise in DNA analyses, a solid
background in population and conservation genetics, as
well as experience in ﬁeld work.

Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary, University of London.
Three years starting Oct 2007. Deadline for applica-
tions - 30 March 2007. Funding is available to students
from the UK ONLY.
’Genetic basis of bat echolocation’
Supervisor: Dr Stephen Rossiter
Echolocation in bats is a striking example of evolu-
tionary innovation, yet the evolution and genetic basis
of echolocation are poorly understood. Echolocation
in bats has either evolved twice or has been lost by
fruit bats. The main aim of this studentship will be
to identify genes involved in echolocation and to screen
bats with divergent sonar signals. Episodes of conver-
gence provide a means of elucidating functional genetic
changes associated with diﬀerent modes of echoloca-
tion.The student will receive training in a range of molecular
genetics techniques including DNA and RNA isolation,
PCR, RT-PCR and sequencing. A period of training
will be spent in Dr Emma Teeling’s lab in Dublin. The
opportunity to undertake ﬁeldwork in the tropics is also
possible though not essential.
Applicants must hold or be expected to achieve at least
a BSc 2i (or equivalent) in a relevant subject. A strong
background in genetics and an interest in evolution-
ary processes are essential. Laboratory experience of
genetic analysis and knowledge of bioinformatics ap-
proaches are desirable. Applicants should send a CV
to s.j.rossiter@qmul.ac.uk, and include a covering let-
ter explaining their motivation for the project and the
names of two academic referees. Short-listed applicants
will be interviewed.

GeneticDiversity
A Ph.D. studentship is available to study genetic diver-
sity and conservation of livestock species at the Roslin
Institute (Edinburgh) starting in September 2007.
Using a variety of computer-based statistical and pop-
ulation genetics approaches, the student will analyze
existing genetic diversity data for both pigs and chick-
ens to improve understanding of breed origins, relation-
ships and structure and to guide future conservation
decisions. Researchers at Roslin are currently taking
advantage of advances in molecular techniques to gen-
erate large-scale genetic data from cattle, pigs, sheep
and poultry. The ultimate aim is to exploit these data
for a better understanding of the history of domestica-
tion and to characterize the diversity both within and
between breeds to inform their future use. One speciﬁc
issue that will be addressed in this project is the de-
tection of introgression into breeds that will facilitate
conservation of historical genomes. This project will
look speciﬁcally at genetic diversity in a group of Chi-
nese and European pig breeds and in British chicken
breeds.
The student will be registered at the Institute of Evo-
lutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh. He or she
will be based at Roslin and will also spend time working
at the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) in Warwick-
shire to become familiar with RBST objectives and toMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 23
disseminate the results of the research to the Trust.
Interested candidates must be British citizens or resi-
dents, should hold a ﬁrst or upper second class honours
degree and have some familiarity with evolutionary bi-
ology, population/quantitative genetics or conservation
biology.

UAmsterdam EvolEcol
PhD student in Evolutionary Ecology (f/m)
The department of Animal Ecology, Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam, The Netherlands has a PhD position avail-
able for the project:
“Parasitism and the evolutionary loss of lipogenesis”
In contrast to other organisms parasitoid wasps lack
the ability to store excess energy in the form of lipid
reserves. This project studies if this remarkable lack of
lipogenesis is associated with the parasitic lifestyle of
these insects and how they can avoid detrimental eﬀects
of their strategy. The two most important questions are
what are the physiological and genetic mechanisms un-
derlying lack of lipogenesis and how common is lack of
lipogenesis in other parasitoid taxa. Experimental work
will include sequence and expression analysis of candi-
date genes involved in lipid metabolism, physiological
manipulation and phylogenetic analysis. The project
may start very shortly.
Tasks -Executing scientiﬁc research as detailed in the
project description. -Publication of results of the re-
search in scientiﬁc journals as well as in a thesis. -
Assisting in undergraduate courses given within the In-
stitute of Ecological Science. -Following the PhD ed-
ucational programme as prescribed by the institute.
Required skills and education -MSc degree in Biol-
ogy, preferably with advanced courses in animal ecol-ogy, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, and an-
imal physiology, or equivalent. -Proﬁciency in both
written and spoken English. -Excellent social skills,
ability to work independently and high motivation will
be assets.
Details The appointment will initially be for 12 months.
After a successful evaluation the contract will be pro-
longed with 36 months. The employment will have to
result in a written thesis. Our fringe beneﬁts of employ-
ment can be found at www.vu.nl/vacatures . Salary

UBristol AdaptationToClimate
NERC PhD Studentship available from Oct 2007
Supervisor: Dr Jon Bridle Department of Biological
Sciences, University of Bristol, BS8 1UD, UK
Tests for adaptation at expanding and contracting
species’ margins
At least 10% of all species are predicted to become com-
mitted to extinction this century due to climate change.
However, these estimates assume that the ecological
tolerances of species’ will not evolve to accommodate
some of this environmental change. This is because we
lack the empirical data to predict how quickly, and un-
der what conditions, populations can adapt when faced
with rapid ecological change.
In Europe, recent climate change has generated range
expansions in the north of butterﬂy species’ distri-
butions, and corresponding range contractions in the
south. However, the ranges of some species have ei-ther not contracted, or have involved shifts in habitat
or behaviour associated with range expansion. These
exceptions may reﬂect adaptation at the range edge, al-
lowing populations to persist in previously unsuitable
conditions.
This project will explore such cases in detail to test
for recent evolution at range margins, and to provide
insight into what conditions prevent or favour local
adaptation in natural populations. It will also address
the more general question of why all species are re-
stricted in their distributions, given that adaptation
at the range edge is possible in certain circumstances,
even over short timescales. The studentship is likely to
involve a combination of genetic and ecological analy-
ses in the UK and/or southern Europe, and could fo-
cus on the Brown Argus butterﬂy Aricia agestis or the
Comma, Polygonia p-album, for which extensive data
are already available. Alternatively, a number of other
butterﬂy species could also be feasible as model organ-
isms.
Interested students should contact me
(jon.bridle@ioz.ac.uk <mailto:jon.bridle@ioz.ac.uk >
) in the ﬁrst instance with a CV and details of two
academic referees. They will then need to submit a
formal application by March 15th 2007. Unfortunately,

Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge
Dr Ellen Nisbet, Department of Biochemistry, Univer-
sity of CambridgeMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 25
We invite applications for a fully funded PhD stu-
dentship in archaeogenetics. The project detailed below
is a candidate for a studentship, and applicants will be
in open competition with others applying both for this
project and other candidate projects within the Grad-
uate School of Biological Sciences. In the event of a
successful application, the project will be supervised
jointly by Prof. Christopher Howe, Department of Bio-
chemistry and Dr Mim Bower, McDonald Institute for
Archaeological Research.
A good ﬁrst degree in Biology, Genetics, Zoology or Ar-
chaeology (1st class or 2:1 or equivalent) is essential and
a Masters degree in a relevant scientiﬁc or archaeolog-
ical discipline will be an advantage. Experience in the
standard range of molecular biology techniques is es-
sential; experience with low-copy number methods (an-
cient DNA) is desirable, but not essential.
Applicants should send a CV and a covering letter de-
tailing their suitability for the project and evidenc-
ing relevant experience, along with two academic ref-
erences, to Dr Mim Bower, McDonald Institute for Ar-
chaeological Research, University of Cambridge, Down-
ing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3ER or by email to:
mab1004@cam.ac.uk.
Applicants must be UK or EU citizens.
Informal enquiries can be made to Dr Mim Bower at
mab1004@cam.ac.uk
The closing date for applications is: Wednesday 7th
March 2007 Shortlisted candidates will be invited for
interview on Wednesday 21st March 2007.
The location and timing of the domestication of the
horse is still a contentious question in archaeology. The
direct evidence for the use of horses before the devel-
opment of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BC, i.e.,
for riding, is scarce and few archaeologists agree on its
interpretation, yet it is clear from the recurrent use of
the horse in imagery and ritual that the horse has been
of great importance to humans for a long time. But if
archaeological evidence cannot be used to understand
the human-horse relationship through time, how are we
to investigate this question?
Archaegenetics, the use of modern population genetics
coupled with the analysis of ancient DNA from the ar-
chaeological specimens themselves has proved a highly
useful tool for understanding the domestication of many
of our other economically important plant and ani-
mal species (pigs, cattle, goats, chickens, maize, wheat,
barely etc..). In the case of horses, a large amount
of mitochondrial data from living horse populations is
now available, but it is proving to be diﬃcult to re-
solve a clear phylogeny with biogeographic structureusing this data. A more robust phylogeny will be pos-
sible if a number of informative nuclear loci are used.
This project proposes to screen an extensive sample
set of living horse populations from central and east
Asia for nuclear markers (microsatellites and SNiPs)
and develop methods for the analysis of these same nu-
clear markers from archaeological horse skeletons from
across central and east Asia in order to resolve the bio-
geography of horse domestication.
The successful applicant would be part of a growing
team working on the archaeogenetics of horse hus-
bandry and adjunct to a new project on the spread of
the chariot across central Asia. There will be opportu-
nities for ﬁeldwork, attending conferences and training
both here at Cambridge, and also in collaborating labs.
The studentship is BBSRC funded, covering both fees
and subsistence, and for up to four years.

UGlasgow AvianSexRatio
NERC PhD Studentship, Division of Environmental
and Evolutionary Biology, University of Glasgow (3
years, starting October 2007)
Sex ratio adjustment in birds
Supervisors: Dr Kathryn Arnold (DEEB) and Profes-
sor Neil Evans (Vet School)
Avian mothers seem to be able to adjust the sex ratio
of their clutches, however, results from diﬀerent popu-
lations of the same species have produced contradictory
results. A vital missing step in the study of sex ratio
adjustment is identifying an underlying physiological
mechanism. This NERC-funded (British Natural En-
vironment Research Council) studentship is concerned
with why and how birds ’decide’ to adjust the sex ra-
tio of their oﬀspring. The project will involve ﬁeldwork
on a nestbox population of blue tits Parus caeruleus, in
Scotland as well as the development and use of biochem-
ical and endocrinological assays. The student would
be fully trained in ﬁeld and lab techniques, and would
beneﬁt from the extensive transferable skills training
oﬀered by IBLS Grad School.
Eligibility: The PhD position is restricted to UK resi-
dents. EU nationals are eligible for full funding only if
they have worked or studied in the UK for a period of
3 years or more prior to the studentship. EU nation-
als who have not been resident in the UK are eligible
for “fee only” awards that do not include a personal

UNottingham InvasiveMoths
A PhD studentship is available to study the traits of po-
tentially invasive moth species in the United Kingdom.
The project will be supervised by Dr Tom Reader at
the University of Nottingham and Dr Jason Chapman
at Rothamsted research centre, and would start in Oc-
tober 2007. Funding (stipend plus tuition) is available
to UK/EU students for three years. A project descrip-
tion follows:
Natural and human-induced biological invasions are
an increasingly signiﬁcant problem, both for natural
ecosystems and human activities. Invasive species often
have catastrophic impacts on the structure and func-
tion of native animal and plant communities, on human
health, and on agricultural crops. An important ﬁnding
arising from both theoretical and empirical studies of
the invasion process is that the rate of arrival of propag-
ules in a new habitat (“propagule pressure”) is a key
determinant of the probability of successful invasion.
It is surprising, therefore, that very few attempts have
been made to quantify or explain the natural variance
which exists within and among species in the propagule
pressure applied to potential new habitats.
The aim of this project is to improve our understand-
ing of the early stages of the invasion process by ex-
ploring natural variance in propagule pressure within
and among potentially invasive moth species in the UK.
The successful candidate will develop their project in-
dependently, using data describing the abundance, life
history, phenology and voltinism of potentially inva-
sive species to answer questions such as: a) which bi-
ological factors inﬂuence the probability of propagule
arrival? b) what is the likelihood that anthropogenic
climate change will modify the rate of invasion through
impacts on propagule pressure? and c) is the general
prediction that species exerting strong propagule pres-
sure are large, fecund and vagile correct?
The project oﬀers research experience in a range of
modern techniques in ecological analysis (e.g. time-
series analysis, phylogenetically-controlled comparative
analysis) and bioclimatic modelling, and will also pro-
vide opportunities for ﬁeld and laboratory studies of
moth life history. We are seeking an independent-
minded candidate with good data handling and ana-
lytical skills, undergraduate experience in ecology andevolutionary biology, and preferably some knowledge of
entomology.
Informal enquiries and applications (CV plus covering
letter and the names of two academic referees) should
be sent to: tom.reader@nottingham.ac.uk.

Revealing gene regulatory networks
Existence of a gene in the genome is not the whole
story-whether or not, how much, and when a gene is
expressed (i.e., transcribed into mRNA which is then
translated into protein) governs how that gene aﬀects
an organism. Recent advances in biological techniques,
such as gene expression microarrays, has enabled the
development of computational algorithms for revealing
the networks controlling gene expression. Such systems
level understanding of gene regulation impacts research
in areas such as development, evolution, and medicine.
In this studentship, you will explore the development
of algorithms for revealing gene regulatory networks
from multiple sources of genomic data. You will build
oﬀ previous research in the group on Bayesian net-
work inference algorithms for revealing gene regulatoryMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 29
networks from gene expression data, developing algo-
rithms capable of integrating other types of informa-
tion, such as prior biological knowledge, sequence mo-
tifs, protein-protein interactions, etc., into this task.
The opportunity exists for performing biological exper-
iments to directly test your computational predictions,
using our laboratory facilities, which maintain yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to perform genetic manipu-
lation studies. Particulars of the project’s ultimate di-
rection will be modiﬁed to ﬁt student interest. Potential
directions include: creating a generic framework for in-
tegrating multiple sources of genomic information into
Bayesian networks; combining Bayesian networks with
other algorithms to increase recovery accuracy; combin-
ing text-mining for prior information with a Bayesian
network; or further developing biological veriﬁcation
techniques.
The studentship will be based at the School of
Biology at the University of St Andrews, super-
vised by Dr. V. Anne Smith. Applicants should
have a background in Statistics, Mathematics or

Dear All
Applications are invited for the following PhD stu-
dentship in my lab:
Plant Evolution: Origins and evolution of invasive
weeds
Two highly invasive weeds to have come out of
South Africa in recent years are Narrow-leaved ragwort
(Senecio inaequidens) and Fireweed (Senecio madagas-
cariensis). By accident these two species were intro-
duced to Europe and to various parts of the South-ern Hemisphere, respectively, where they have become
highly invasive during the last 50 years. The two weeds
form part of a complex of closely related taxa native to
South Africa in which species boundaries are diﬃcult
to distinguish, polyploid relationships are confused, and
mating system variation requires detailed examination.
It is proposed to analyse the pattern of genetic diver-
gence within this complex to obtain an improved un-
derstanding of species’ relationships and evolution. A
range of recently developed molecular tools for Senecio
will be used to analyse material sampled from through-
out the native (South Africa) and introduced ranges of
species comprising the complex. The research will help
clarify the origins and evolution of two highly invasive
weeds within the context of the evolution of the group
from which they are derived.

Doctoral position available in Evolutionary Biology and
Biodiversity in the Zoological Museum at the Univer-
sity of Zurich in Switzerland
The research group in Evolutionary Biology and Bio-
diversity led by Professor Tony Wilson in the Zoologi-
cal Museum ( www.unizh.ch/zoolmus ) is seeking a well-
qualiﬁed and highly motivated doctoral candidate for30 EvolDir March 1, 2007
a position at the University of Zurich. This position is
for three years, beginning in May 2007, with a yearly
salary of 36,000 Swiss Francs ($30,000US). A later start
date is possible for exceptional candidates. A Masters
degree or equivalent is a prerequisite for acceptance into
the Ph.D. program at the University of Zurich.
Our group concentrates on the role of sexual selection
in the speciation process. Integrating molecular phylo-
genetic, population genetic and functional genomic ap-
proaches, our work spans a broad temporal scale in an
eﬀort to derive testable hypotheses on the evolution of
taxonomic diversity. Over the past several years, our re-
search has concentrated on syngnathid ﬁshes (seahorses
and pipeﬁsh), a group of particular interest due to spe-
cialized morphological adaptations for male parental
care and female-dominated competition for access to
mates. Our work involves ongoing collaborations with
researchers in America, Europe and Australia.
Major histocompatibility (MH) genes are part of the
adaptive immune system and are believed to play an
important role in vertebrate mate choice. The PhD
candidate will investigate the evolution and diversiﬁca-
tion of MH genes in syngnathid ﬁshes and the role of
these molecules in mate choice decisions of Hippocam-
pus seahorses. Genome size estimates suggest a large
scale gene and/or genome duplication event occurred
early in the evolution of syngnathid ﬁshes, an event
which likely inﬂuenced the subsequent diversiﬁcation
of MH genes in this group. Recent research in our
lab has identiﬁed a large number of unlinked MH loci
in the compact genome of Hippocampus abdominalis.
The candidate will construct a genetic linkage map for
a laboratory population of this species using a suite
of 300 microsatellite loci and characterize the distribu-
tion and variance of MH genes in the genome. Follow-
ing the characterization of MH diversity in Hippocam-
pus, a comparative approach will be used to study rates
and patterns of genetic change of these loci in related
species. At the same time, candidate MH loci will be
used in a series of mate choice trials.
Our lab is equipped with three 5000L climate-controlled
aquarium facilities for the culture of marine ﬁshes under
controlled conditions. Our laboratory facilities include
a MJ Tetrad PCR machine and an ABI 3100 sequencer,
with access to a high-throughput ABI 3730 48-capillary
machine. In addition, our Functional Genomics center
(www.fgcz.unizh.ch ) oﬀers extensive facilities for pro-
teomics and bioinformatics. The core bioinformatics
facility of the University consists of two 4 processor
Opteron Servers and an 8 TB ﬁle system capable of
running all Unix-based bioinformatics and phylogenet-
ics software packages.The University is one of the top comprehensive institu-
tions in Europe and the Zoological Museum is a center
of excellence in behavioural ecology, population genet-
ics and evolution. With a critical mass of researchers
in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
and the neighbouring Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology (ETH Zurich), Zurich oﬀers an exceptional aca-
demic environment for research and study.
Zurich is an international city of 350,000 located at the
heart of Europe, with world-class facilities for sport,
music and theatre. With its location at the head of
Lake Zurich and its proximity to the Swiss Alps, there
are incredible opportunities for sailing, skiing, hiking
and mountaineering in the region. For all of these rea-
sons, Zurich has been ranked the top city in the world
for quality of living.
Interested candidates should submit a Curriculum vi-
tae and statement of research interests, along with a
list of two references, by email or post to Rosemarie
Keller, Institute Secretary (kellerro@zoolmus.unizh.ch)
by March 15, 2007. Any questions on the
position should be directed to Prof. Wilson

3 PhD positions in evolutionary genomics/evolutionary
biology
Three PhD positions are available at the Swedish Re-
search Council Centre of Excellence in Evolutionary
Genomics at the Evolutionary Biology Centre (EBC)
in Uppsala, under the supervision of Prof. Hans El-
legren. The overall proﬁle of the group is the general
analysis of how mutation, selection, recombination and
gene expression relate to molecular mutation, and theMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 31
study of the genetic architecture behind phenotypic di-
versity and ﬁtness related traits.
There are several possibilities for research projects and
the precise line of research will be discussed and de-
cided together with the successful applicants, depend-
ing on their background and interest. Together with
colleagues in Los Angeles, Illinois and St Louis, our
group has a coordinating role in the zebra ﬁnch genome
project. Much of our research the coming years will
therefore be devoted to whole-genome analysis of avian
genomes, with comparison to mammalian and outgroup
genomes, including large-scale data on polymorphism
and gene expression. Example of questions that will be
addressed include the analysis of selection and function
of conserved non-coding DNA, the role of positive se-
lection in driving the evolution of genes behind certain
phenotypes, the genetic background to avian-speciﬁc
adaptations, sexual antagonism and sex-biased gene
expression, and evolution of the transcriptome and of
protein networks. Another approach will involve QTL-
mapping in pedigrees of diﬀerent bird species, with the
aim of identifying genes governing behavioural, mor-
phological and other traits.
Swedish PhD positions are for 4 years and are paid
throughout the studies. The new students will be part
of a group consisting of 5 post-docs, 3 PhD students
and 1 technician. The Evolutionary Biology Centre
(http://www.ebc.uu.se ) is situated in recently-built lo-
calities in central Uppsala and is equipped with fa-
cilities for large-scale sequencing, genotyping and ex-pression analysis. The working atmosphere is interna-
tional with English as working language. The Centre
constitutes an exciting arena for multidisciplinary re-
search in evolutionary biology in a broad sense, hous-
ing some 400 scientists and graduate students, with re-
search programs including ecology, systematics, genet-
ics, genomics, functional genomics and developmental
biology. Uppsala University is the oldest university in
Scandinavia and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student
town with beautiful surroundings conveniently situated
close to Stockholm.
The positions are open to everyone with a BSc or
(preferably) MSc with experience from and interest in
one or several of the following areas: bioinformatics
including own programming, population genetics, ge-
nomics, evolutionary biology, or related subjects. Inter-
ested parties should send a statement of interest, and a
detailed CV including contact information for two ref-
erences to Hans Ellegren (Hans.Ellegren@ebc.uu.se), to
whom informal inquires also can be made. The search
will continue until the positions are ﬁlled - starting date
is open to discussion.

Research Technician Position in Human Evolutionary
Genomics
A research technician position is available in a human
population genetics laboratory in the Department of
Biology at the University of Maryland at College Park
for NIH and NSF funded research. Projects in the
lab focus on a unique resource of >6,000 DNA sam-
ples from ~100 ethnically and geographically diverse
African populations. These samples are being used for
genome-level analyses of diversity at both coding and
non-coding loci (including high throughput resequenc-
ing and whole genome SNP and STRP genotyping).
For many of these samples we also have phenotype
data for a number of traits that are likely important
in adaptation, including those with a complex pattern
of inheritance. We are using these data (1) to infer
population structure and demographic history and test
models of modern human evolution (2) to identify re-
gions of the genome that are targets of selection us-
ing whole genome scans (3) to identify functionally sig-
niﬁcant variants using genotype/phenotype association
studies as well as gene expression analyses (4) to study
the genetic basis of resistance against infectious dis-
ease (with a focus on malaria) and co-evolution of the
human and Plasmodium falciparum genomes. Collab-
orators on these projects include Jonathan Pritchard,
Molly Przeworski, Carlos Bustamante, Josh Akey, Greg
Wray, Philip Awadalla, Gil McVean, and Anna Tra-
montano. Additional information about the Tishkoﬀ

The position is at the Department of Biology, under
Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Univer-
sity of Oslo.
This post comes under the Department of Biology, Pro-
gram for experimental behaviour and population ecol-
ogy (EBE). Currently there are 5 full professors, 3 post
doc researchers, 3 Ph.D. students, 7 M.Sc. students
and 1 technician working within the research program.
The research program has strength in studies of pop-
ulation and behavioural ecology of terrestrial inverte-
brates, mammals, birds and lichens. The EBE staﬀ hasMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 49
a close collaboration with the companion research pro-
grams at the Department. The Department has long
traditions in the alpine ecosystem of the Finse area
(Hardangervidda), in particular in studies on adapta-
tions and on life history traits and population dynamics
of key organisms of the alpine tundra.
The post includes the administrative leadership (man-
agement) of Finse research center, established in 1972
and owned by the University of Oslo (UiO) and the
University of Bergen (UiB). The center is located in
the northwestern corner of the Hardangervidda plateau,
1200 m asl. The center activities include research
projects, ﬁeld courses for students at all levels and pro-
curement of all disciplines of natural sciences, in par-
ticular in high mountain ecology. The center serves as
a ﬁeld station for researchers and students from UiO,
UiB, and other national and international universities.
The manager is expected to administrate the various
activities, including practical and economical responsi-
bilities, and expects to develop university courses and
research projects in his/her ﬁeld of science and to su-
pervise MSc and PhD students doing their work at the
station. The manager is also expected to participate
in the daily activities at the center, in particular dur-
ing the summer months. The remote localisation of the
center calls for an independent and self-willed person
with practical skills being familiar with outdoor activ-
ities in the arctic-alpine zone.
A requirement for the post is that the successful candi-
date initiates projects and research activities at the cen-
ter, and connects these to his/her research group at the
Department of Biology, UiO. The successful candidate
is expected to develop research activities of high inter-
national standard and to collaborate with the existing
research environments at the Department. The appli-
cant is therefore asked to present his/her own plans for
the future work at the center. Furthermore, the appli-
cant must document an ability to ﬁnance his/her own
research activities. Administrative experience, in par-
ticular in research funding and planning, and teaching
experience, will give an advantage.
A doctor’s degree, strong publication record, postdoc-
toral experience and teaching experience are required.
Experience from ﬁeld work in alpine environments, and
in the discipline of entomological ecology and popula-
tion biology are advantageous.

The University of Wales, Bangor provides research,
teaching and learning of the highest quality. The RAE
4 rated School of Biological Sciences (SBS), within
the newly created College of Natural Sciences, is at
the forefront of delivering this vision with its acknowl-edged delivery of world-class research and excellence
in teaching. As part of a University-wide commit-
ment to research, we seek a research-active Head of
School with drive and vision to promote and coordi-
nate high quality and distinctive output within our
key research areas ( http://biology.bangor.ac.uk ). The
appointment coincides with a period of major Uni-
versity expansion of research supported by consider-
able funding ( £11M) from the Higher Education Fund-
ing Council for Wales and the Welsh Assembly Gov-
ernment, which underpin an innovative research and
enterprise partnership between Bangor and the Uni-
versity of Wales, Aberystwyth. Such activity is en-
hanced by the Natural Environment Research Council’s
(NERC) recent investment in the partnership between
the University of Wales, Bangor and the NERC Centre
for Ecology and Hydrology to create the Environment
Centre for Wales ( http://biology.bangor.ac.uk/school/-
environment-centre/ ), within which SBS will play a
leading role. Applications will be especially welcome
from candidates who can contribute to the zoological
or environmental aspects of our research portfolio. An
appropriate package consistent with a research-active
Head (including a Deputy Head plus the support of
an experienced administrative and technical team led
by the School’s Administrator, Teaching Administra-
tor and Chief Technician) will be oﬀered.
Bangor now seeks an outstanding individual as Head of
School with commensurate research credentials and the
ability to lead a thriving and dynamic academic com-
munity. They will be excited by the prospect of working
within the pioneering multidisciplinary College struc-
ture (SBS, Schools of Ocean Sciences, and the Environ-
ment and Natural Resources), and will contribute to
the overall vision of the University. Bangor is adjacent
to the Snowdonia National Park, an area of outstanding
natural beauty, with a diverse range of natural environ-
ments from rocky coastlands to alpine vegetation, and
is well served by major routes and two international
airports within 1.5 h.

Reader / Chair of Environmental Genomics
Reader Grade: £46,624 - £49,167 p.a. or Salary nego-
tiable in Professorial Range (minimum £46,624 p.a.)
Applications to the School of Biological Sciences are in-
vited from candidates with a proven world-class record
of research in environmental genomics. We expect ap-
plicants to investigate organism function within the en-
vironment in its broadest context by exploiting state-
of-the-art genomic and post-genomic technology. The
successful candidate will advance evolutionary and eco-
logical theory, or an understanding of ecosystem struc-
ture and function, utilising existing and new genomic
knowledge and technology. Achieving this will be facili-
tated by linkage with the strong research base in molec-
ular ecology and evolution, gene regulation, metabolite
proﬁling, ecosystem function and conservation already
present in Bangor and collaborating institutions. This
is enhanced by NERC’s recent investment in the part-
nership between the University of Wales, Bangor and
the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology to create
the Environment Centre for Wales.
Applicants will have a strong track record of research
funding, academic leadership and collaboration. Re-search themes of particular interest include genomic
regulation of ecological interactions between species
(e.g. symbiosis, pathogen-host, herbivore-plant or re-
source competition), or of biological response to envi-
ronmental change (e.g. climate, pollution, land use)
and the evolution of adaptive variation.
The post is permanent, but is funded in the ﬁrst
instance by the new £11m Research and Enterprise
Partnership between the University of Wales, Aberys-
twyth and the University of Wales, Bangor. The ap-
pointee will join the Centre for Integrative Research in
the Rural Environment programme within the partner-
ship which links Bangor’s research with the recently
strengthened international expertise in bioinformatics,
metabolomics and molecular and environmental plant
genetics in Aberystwyth. In addition, the successful
candidate will contribute to teaching in the School of
Biological Sciences within their own specialisation and
perform relevant administrative duties.

18srRNA alignment
Hello All, I am working on phylogenetic study which
uses 18S rRNA, and I am trying to make a secondary
structure rRNA alignment for 30+ sequences (inverte-
brates). I found out that many papers refer to DCSE
(Dedicated Comparative Sequence Editor) written by
Peter De Rijk, however all internet links direct to a site
which is dead. I have also tried (and failed) to reach
the author. I have therefore these questions:
1) does anyone know if this software is still in use and if
yes where I can get it? 2) if there is an alternative pack-
age which can read/edit or assist in alignment of rRNA
with secondary structure (i.e. what do YOU use?) 3) ifany of you came across any good “practical” guide on
how to do the secondary structural alignment for 18S
rRNA, whether it is “by hand” or computer software
assisted.

Application Pathogen Evol
Dear EvolDir readers,
I am looking for examples of molecular evolutionary
studies of pathogens that have led to actual treatments
or vaccines.
I am particularly interested in dN/dS ratios of
pathogen genes and evidence of horizontal gene trans-
fer within/between pathogen species. There seem to be
many interesting studies that ﬁnd, for example, some
codons evolving under diversifying selective pressures,
and conclude with “this research will be useful in vac-
cine development,” but have any of these ideas been
picked up by researchers in drug/vaccine development?
Thanks for any references that you can point me to-
wards (or good search terms if I’ve been completely
blind!).

Beagle Project
The Beagle Project:
The Beagle Project aims to build a sailing replica
of HMS Beagle and recreate the Voyage of the Bea-
gle that inspired Charles Darwin’s big idea. http://-
www.thebeagleproject.com/ The replica Beagle is not
intended to be a museum ship; she will be equipped
with laboratories and equipment to allow overlapping
crews of practising and aspiring scientists to carry out
speciﬁc programmes of research. The circumnaviga-
tion will oﬀer opportunities for science worth doing,
and worth communicating.
Research aboard the Beagle will be: * original,
question-driven science of international scope and rele-
vance that demonstrably robust to the peer-review pro-
cess * a vehicle for communicating science to a rangeof audiences, students and young adults in particular
The Beagle Project will issue a call for research project
proposals in late 2007/early 2008, but until then we
invite researchers to send us their ideas on an infor-
mal basis. All projects must support the aims listed
above (original research, science communication, sci-
ence education). Projects funded in whole or in part
by peer-reviewed granting agencies will be given prior-
ity. People wishing to sail with us and use the Beagle
for scientiﬁc research will need sea legs, be prepared to
do some science mentoring and rope-hauling (emeriti
not excepted).

Beetle phylogeography
Dear all,
I am working on beetle phylogeography using mitochon-
drial DNA sequences (cytochrome oxydase I and II).
My problem is concerning heteroplasmy (i.e. for one
individual, the presence of two kinds of DNA in one
mitochondrion, or two kinds of mitochondria). Indeed,
half analysed individuals showed double peaks at 1 to
8 nucleotide sites. This was conﬁrmed by the reverse
sequences.
I have tried to perform analyses by coding these am-
biguous sites using the IUPAC code. However softwares
such as PAUP have diﬃculties while the analyses are
running.
I am interested in deﬁning the potential haplotypes
without having to clone them.
Is anyone aware of suitable analyses and/or softwares
providing mitochondrial DNA haplotypes when hetero-
plasmy is involved?
Any help will be appreciated.
Best regards,56 EvolDir March 1, 2007

Boa constrictor micros
I am a PhD student at DICE (Durrell Institute of Con-
servation and Ecology) at the University of Kent, Eng-
land and would like to know if anyone is currently de-
veloping microsatellite primers for Boa constrictor.
I am working with Hog Island Boas (Boa constrictor
imperator) and have so far had very limited success
in cross amplifying markers in this subspecies. I was,
therefore, wondering if anyone was either in the pro-
cess of developing speciﬁc markers for Boa constrictor
or would be interested in collaborating/partially fund-
ing the development of a microstellite library?

Volunteer Opportunity
We are looking for volunteers on a new project looking
at the evolution of dispersal and sociality. The themes
of this work are centered on the evolution of sociality
and meta-population dynamics. This project seeks to
experimentally manipulate parameters in dispersal be-
havior and social aggregations to understand trade-oﬀs
and key determinants of the evolution of these behav-
iors. The project is lab based in nature using Tetrahy-
mena thermophila, a unicellular ciliated protist, as a
model organism. Volunteers are expected to partici-pate in maintenance of cultures, experimental manipu-
lations, and the best candidates will also be capable of
helping to plan experiments and process data.
This project is run in Dr. Jean Clobert’s lab and stu-
dents will work with both Dr. Clobert and Dr. Alexis
Chaine. The lab is situated in the foothills of the French
Pyrenees Mountains at a CNRS ﬁeld station (Moulis /
Saint Girons). Students will be provided with hous-
ing but will be expected to cover their other expenses.
Work is ongoing and volunteers can begin at a nego-
tiated date. Duration of work is ﬂexible, and while
volunteers are expected to commit to a minimum of 4
weeks, priority will be given to those who can commit
to longer periods.
For more information, please contact Alexis Chaine

Climate change
Hi all,
Today (February 2) a milestone was reached in the cli-
mate change debate as the IPCC (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change; http://www.ipcc.ch ) had a
press release to announce its 4th Assessment Report on
climate change. The previous Assessment Report was
from 2001. Based on a wealth of scientiﬁc data, the new
report provides by far the strongest warning on human
mediated climate change to date. More information,
including the “Summary for Policymakers” (pdf) and a
link to a web cast of the press conference, can be found
at:
http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/index.html Amongst other
points, the “Summary for Policymakers” projects that
average global temperature will rise by 1.8-4 degrees
and sea levels will rise by 18-58 centimeters by 2100.
Importantly, such a temperature change may push the
global climate beyond a threshold at which feedback
mechanisms (e.g., reduced polar ice caps leading to in-
creased heat absorption; release of methane from melt-
ing tundra adding to the greenhouse eﬀect) will make
the climate change irreversible.
Obviously, the time for politicians and policymakers to
catch on to reality is now. I believe that as evolutionary
scientists we have a moral responsibility to spread the
word on this issue. Let your students and colleagues
know - the more climate change is discussed the better!
Sincerely,
Johan Lindell

DNA extraction from seeds CTAB58 EvolDir March 1, 2007
Hi
I would like to extract DNA from some plant seeds and
have some methodological questions that I hope some-
one out there can help with.
1) When I browse the internet for common methods I
see that many use CTAB. Can any one tell me why this
seems to be so popular, and what it does? I know its a
detergent, but what makes it special compared to SDS
or alternatives
2) Would digestion with a CTAB buﬀer be more ef-
ﬁcient (well better overall) than simply grinding the
seeds and then digesting them in a buﬀer containing
Tris, NaCl, DTT, SDS and proteinas k?
3) I was going to follow either of the above with an
organic puriﬁcation then precipitation. Does anyone
have any feel how any of the commercial kits perform
compared to such traditional methods?
Thanks for your help!

DNA extraction from seeds CTAB
answers
I recently posted a query about plant DNA extractions
namely what exactly does CTAB contribute to the pro-
cess, and what methods do people recommend. Thanks
for the replies I received, they were extremely useful.
Particularly I wish to thank the following:
Donovan Bailey Anders S Larsen Joe Staton Andreas
Zipperle Sara Good-Avila Polly Spencer-Vellacott
With respect to CTAB itself
>>>>
I believe that CTAB was developed for use with mu-
cilaginous bacteria to get rid of the very gooey glyco-
proteins that SDS will not.
>>>>
CTAB is so popular in plant extractions because early
published approaches illusrated its broad utility and so
people stuck with it. Most commercially available Plant
extraction kits now use protocols much more akin to a
typical phage lysis extraction. To the best of my knowl-
edge nobody uses proteinase K in plant extractions -
that approach is generally restricted to animal basedsystems (but it may be useful in some groups).
Whether or not to use CTAB or another approach often
depends on the quality of DNA you recover from either
- they are such diﬀerent approaches that one will often
work well in a particular group of plants while another
fails miserably - I would try both and see what works
best for you seeds.
>>>>
Although with regards to Prot K.
All of the traditional recipes we have used include
CTAB. CTAB binds to the cell wall debris, proteins and
polysaccharides in the homogenate: once you perform a
phenol-chloroform extraction after the CTAB step, the
CTAB/debris/polysaccharide/protein mix is removed.
We also include proteinase K to facilitate digestion of
the relatively compact tissue in the seeds.
>>>>>
One other thing I learnt, that may be useful to some of
you who might be as na¨ ıve with plants as I am
I extracted DNA from seeds of Fraxinus excelsior (ash
tree). I used a kit (Qiagen) but what may be impor-
tant (you probably know it already) is that if you are
interested in the seed genotype you separate the embryo
from the endocarp etc, which might have the maternal
genotype.
With respect to diﬀerent method (and here I include
names incase anyone needs to chase up anything with
the original responder)
>>>>
We (Donovan Bailey) have recently published a very
inexpensive and high throughput method that mimics
commercially available kits (who claim to have propri-
etary approaches - all components of which were actu-
ally published many years ago). You can see our paper
in molecular ecology notes -
http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j .
1471-8286.2006.01549.x
>>>>
Qiagens plant extracion kits work ﬁne for baobab seeds
(scant endosperm) I’ve experienced, but be aware of
the quantity - you easily reduce your yield if adding
too much material here!
I’ve seen one protocol where you simply put the re-
quired amount of seed into water overnight and extract
the decired way (kits or CTAB) afterward, saving the
nitrogen. Can’t remember the details, but can come
back with the protocol next week (Anders Larsen).
>>>>March 1, 2007 EvolDir 59
I am using microsatellites and I used both, CTAB and
a SDS based methods for DNA extraction from seeds. I
do not exactly know what CTAB does, but the quality
of DNA that I got using a commercial (Sephaglas) and
homemade glasmilk is much better with CTAB . Nev-
ertheless, using glasmilk from the really ﬁne-fraction of
silica resulted in good quality DNA as well (at least
for msats). While CTAB extracted DNA can be stored
for at least two years in a -20 freezer this might not
be true for SDS. I never used a kit, because our home
made method performs pretty good, is streamlined for
a 96 well format, can be used with CTAB or SDS and is
much cheaper than a kit. If you are interested Elphin-
stone et al. (2003) Mol Ecol Notes 3, 317 - 320 is the
basis for our extraction method and the method itself
will be published soon. (Andreas Zipperle)
>>>>
I’ve pasted the protocol we are currently using below.
This protocol works brilliantly for us - it is fast and
gives high yields and very reliable post-PCR. Although
it is preferable to remove the seed coat, this isn’t al-
ways practically feasible or necessary. Currently, we
are using this protocol on apple seeds.
Modiﬁed slightly from Kang et al. 1998. Our (Sara
Good-Avila’s) protocol for extraction from apple
You can start with the whole seed, or the seed - mi-
nus the seed coat. Depending on the size of the seed
use all or part of it. For apples we use one whole
seed/extraction. You can adjust the volume of extrac-
tion buﬀers and ﬁnal eluate for other seed sizes.
- Place the seed in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml). -
Add 200 ul of extraction buﬀer containing proteinase
K (50 ug), incubate at 37 C for 1 h.

DNase DNA cDNA
Hi,
We’re studying expression of single-exon genes using
PCR and cDNA isolated from diﬀerent sea urchin tis-
sues. But, PCR with an intron-containing sequence (a
control) shows that there’s DNA contamination. We’reusing the Bio-Rad PureZol and iScript kits. DNase
treatment is part of the protocol, but in some samples
it doesn’t seem to do the job. Has anyone had this
problem (with this kit or others) and is there a solu-
tion? We’ve thought of using only a poly-T primer
(rather than the poly-T plus random hexamers), but
it seems to me that getting rid of DNA shouldn’t be
impossible. Suggestions?
Thanks,

Double sequence after cloning
Hi all,
We have been using TOPO TA cloning (kit from in-
vitrogen) to sequence from a number of enriched mi-
crosatellite libraries and we were encountering a high
percentage of what looked like double sequence or con-
taminated sequence in our chromoatographs. After a
while, we noticed that in all of these cases, one of the
two overlapping sequences was our target insert and
the other corresponded to vector that appears to have
been cut in two places (thus excising a small fragment)
and re-ligated by Vaccinia topoisomerase I (which rec-
ognizes the sequence CCCTT but in this case appears
to have also cut at a CCCT site further along in the
vector). There is obviously a lot more to this, but
my question is whether anyone has noticed a similar
problem? We designed a primer that eliminates the
double sequence problem and would like to publish our
methods but reviewers have been skeptical about how
widespread the problem might be. We do know of a
couple of other labs that have experienced this problem
but we would like to expand our sample size (especially
interested in any pertinent information that has been
published or is available online).

Ensis directus E americanus samples60 EvolDir March 1, 2007
Dear Evoldir members,
I have recently started my PhD thesis at the University
of La Coru˜ na (Spain), looking at the population genet-
ics of a few species of bivalves. I’m currently working on
a razor clam species called /Ensis directus/ (syn. /En-
sis americanus/). This species is present on the North
American East Coast, and it ranges from the Baltic Sea
to France and Great Britain in Europe. I’m currently
trying to get material from a wide range of locations. I
would really appreciate if you have any samples of this
species suitable for DNA analyses that you may be able
to share with me or if you may be able to collect some
individuals and send them to University of La Coru˜ na.
We would of course provide the cost of postage.
Thank you very much for you help.

Estimating Divergence Times
answers
A few weeks ago I posted a question re: estimating
divergence times. A number of people requested that
I forward the responses. The most popular response
was to use the program BEAST, which allows a relaxed
molecular clock. Thank you to all who replied.
You may want to try the software package BEAST
which I am one of the authors of.
It does Bayesian MCMC estimation of divergence times
without assuming a particular tree topology. The paper
to look at is:
DRUMMOND, A.J., HO, S.Y.W., PHILLIPS, M.J.,
RAMBAUT, A., ’Relaxed phylogenetics and dating
with conﬁdence.’ PLoS Biol 4, e88, 2006
http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/-
?request=get-document <http://-
biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-
document&doi.1371/ journal.pbio.0040088 >
&doi.1371/journal.pbio.0040088
There has been a workshop on dates and rates in Ade-laide just last week, after which I have decided to use
BEAST to calculate divergence dates. I have similar
situation to yours: mtDNA, some estimates of diver-
gence rates (from 2 to 12% per mln yrs), no calibration
points, and rejected molecular clock. BEAST imple-
ments the model of “relaxed clock” which allows each
branch on the tree have its own speciﬁc mutation rate.
Given mutation rates (or strong mutation rate pri-
ors) it spits out an ultrametric tree with estimates
of the age for major nodes and 95% credibility inter-
vals around them (thus incorporating uncertainties in
the phylogeny). Also, BEAST estimates parameters of
population growth (if the model of growth is chosen by
you as the most appropriate model for your organisms)
and population size, because age of the nodes depends
on pop size (tau=Ne*mu).
You have to be patient with BEAST, though: there are
thousands of models to navigate through, you have to
have strong apriori priors and think of the best model
for your data.
Have you tried the program BEAST? That’s what I
used when I was in a similar situation. It incorpo-
rates uncertainty in your phylogeny by sampling over
many diﬀerent trees, weighted according to their pos-
terior probability. It can give you an estimate, with
a 95% conﬁdence interval, of the divergence time be-
tween two or more groups. You can specify diﬀerent
evolutionary models (e.g. relaxed clock, or allowing
diﬀerent lineages to evolve at diﬀerent rates, if that ﬁts
your data best). The program can be found at http:/-
/evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/ Hope that helps.
Sincerely, my advice is : do not try to calculate di-
vergence times without good fossil calibration. Even if
they are fashionable, phylogenetic methods cannot do
better than fossils for estimating divergence times. So if
you do not have any fossils, your estimations will have
no meaning at all.
You must be very careful when estimating divergence
times with a single locus. Even if the gene is clocklike,
what you will really be measuring is the locus speciﬁc
divergence time, not the true species divergence time.
This will vary throughout the genome due to stochas-
tic processes governed by population parameters like
population sizes, rates of divergence etc... How deep
are the relationships you are trying to reveal? Species
level, genus level, family level, etc? For just COI, you
may have a diﬃcult time getting good estimates of di-
vergence, no matter what optimality criterion you use.
I have used a simple 2% /million years rate before to
get an estimate of divergence times, but this was for a
small group of very recently derived species, and I was
more interested in relative diﬀerences rather than ab-March 1, 2007 EvolDir 61
solute. A sweepingly broad estimate may be the best
you can hope for given your poor resolution and sin-
gle locus. You might check out “Estimating divergence
times from molecular data on phylogenetic and popu-
lation genetic timescales” by Arbogast et al 2002 for
ideas.
FWIW, in my research on Hawaiian bees I found that
COI was evolving at a rate of up to 13% per mil-
lion years (9% in *amino acids*!). That’s a minimum
rate (though based on the fastest-evolving species) cal-
ibrated by populations within a species on islands of
known age. That of course is assuming that the bug
arrived as soon as the island emerged, which is unlikely.
Not that your things are necessarily that weird, but just
pointing out that the real rate might be quite diﬀerent
from 1.4%, and to be wary if you’re attaching absolute
dates to it.

Fennel pondweed beds62 EvolDir March 1, 2007
Dear members of EvolDir,
As a PhD student I’m currently involved in a project
concerning among other factors the genetic diversity of
the freshwater macrophyte fennel pondweed (or sago
pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus, Stuckenia pecti-
nata) in relation to herbivory. I am particularly looking
for shallow wetlands with beds or large patches of this
plant in Mediterranean or temperate Europe. Ideally,
I would like to know if these localities are visited by
Bewick’s swans or Whooper swans that may forage on
the tubers of fennel pondweed. Both localities receiving
many of these birds or close to none at all are suitable.
I would be very grateful if you have information that
you would like to share with me.

Freshwater to Marine Colonisations
Dear All
We are looking for examples in which a species has
undergone population size expansion sometime in the
past; for example as when an island species colonises the
mainland. Ideally we would like these events to have
occured within the last 10 million years but not within
the last million, but we will accept just about any-
thing for consideration since we are very short of data.
We are looking for further examples of island to main-
land colonisation and examples of freshwater species
invading the marine environment. The cases of island
to mainland colonisation we have so far looked at are
chameleons, anole lizards, the plant Coraria, Monarcha
birds and Eleutherodactylus frogs.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I am getting an unusual result with GenClone 1.0 on
one of 11 plant populations that I am analyzing. One of
the smaller population samples (n 11) analyzed across
16 SSR loci has 9 multi-locus genotypes with only a sin-
gle one-allele pairwise diﬀerence (i.e., 8 of the 9 MLGs
are quite distinct). Shannon-Weiner diversity is rea-
sonably high (2.098) and Shannon Evenness is 0.955.
Simpson diversity is 0.945, but for some reason Simp-
son evenness = 0. I have run the analysis several times,
and always with the same result. This makes little sense
to me. Is it something to do with my sample size (I have
another population for which n = 11 and it did not have
a similar problem), or have I perhaps uncovered a bug?
Any one have any ideas?
Thanks.

Genemapper problems
Genemapper 4.0 and AFLPs
Hello everyone,
I am using Genemapper 4.0 to analyse my AFLP data
(ABI 3730) and have encountered following problem:
Samples with a red symbol in the SQ column need
correcting manually in the Size Match Editor. I ex-
actly follow all the steps outlined in the ’AFLP System
Analysis Getting Started Guide’ and I can successfully
manually correct mislabelled peaks. After clicking ’Ap-
ply’ and ’OK’ I need to reanalyse the corrected sample.
That’s where the problem starts. Having done so the
red symbol appears again in the SQ column and when
I check the Size Match Editor all the changes I have
made before are undone and the peaks show the same
mislabels as before correcting them. All this happensMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 63
in the AFLP Default Analysis Method.
If I do the same in the Microsatellite Analysis Method
then the changes are saved and a green symbol appears
after reanalysing in the SQ column. But unfortunately
I am running AFLPs and not microsatellites so I need
to be able to change mislabelled peaks in the AFLP
Analysis Method.
Has anybody encountered a similar problem in Gen-
emapper 4.0?
Thank you

Genetic Cartography History

and Cartography,” (750 words, 5 references, and 1
to 3 illustrations) to appear in the sixth volume of
the encyclopedia “History of cartography” <http://-
www.geography.wisc.edu/histcart/ >. More or less I
know what I will write but I would like to know if
someone can provide any valuable reference of the ﬁrst
genetic maps. I mean, when and where they were
published. Maps not in terms of symbols or written
frequencies on a maps but more advanced represen-
tations like interpolation curves of frequencies, PCA
components against long/lat coordinates etc. The en-
try should provide an overview of the last century. If
anyone has an idea or can send a suggestion it will be
highly appreciated.

Franz Manni <manni@mnhn.fr >GeneticDistance with linkage
Hi all,
I am working with some nuclear sequences that show
heterozygous positions for most individuals. Since I
cannot ascribe the 2 sequences of each individual I
would like to use these heterozygous positions to es-
timate genetic distances between individuals. But, to
do that I should take into consideration linkage between
these loci.
Does anyone know of a program that estimates genetic
distances correcting for linkage between loci?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thanks!

Honeysuckle micros
Dear colleagues,
I was wondering if anybody has developed or knows
of microsatellite primers for the Amur honeysuckle,
Lonicera maackii (or any other honeysuckle, assuming
that they would cross-hybridize with Amur honeysuckle
DNA). I am studying gene ﬂow in the Amur honey-
suckle and therefore am interested in loci that are likely
to be poylmorphic. Hence the need for micros. But if
any other markers have been developed and are suitable
for this purpose, I would love to hear of it.
Finally, I have already collected the samples, but I’d
have to outsource the bench work since I don’t have a
wet-lab. Any suggestions for outsourcing that would be
good and fairly inexpensive?
Thanks very much.

Human Nucleotide ratios
NUCLEOTIDE RATIOS:
The following question seems quite elementary but I
found no answers for it.
I would be grateful for any answers:
What are the ratios between the four nucleotides
A,C,G,T in humans in:
The whole genome. The exons, the introns, non coding
DNA, and junk DNA.
In genetically variable loci.
Thanks in advance,

IntragenicRecombination in fungi
EvolDir community,
I have a question:
Does anybody know of any published papers demon-
strating direct evidence of intragenic recombination
within or between loci in a natural or agricultural
ecosystem of a fungal species? O1Donnell et al (2000)
in a PNAS paper (97:7905-7910) suggested that they
were the ﬁrst to their knowledge.
Thanks, Greg

Micro identiﬁcationDear EvolDir members,
I have a methodological question that deals with the
assessment of clonal diversity with microsatellite loci.
Could we consider that each observed multilocus geno-
type (MLG) mirrors reality? Or is it more realistic to
consider two or more MLG diﬀering by only one allele
at a locus (out of several) as a unique MLG? For ex-
ample, could one consider the two following MLG to be
diﬀerent or identical? :
(1) 0102 0202 0405 0405 0103 0203 0405 0405 (2) 0102
0202 0405 0405 0103 0202 0405 0405
Does someone know papers, methods or softwares that
could help to take a decision by taking into account
allelic frequencies or genotyping error rates?
thank you very much for any help and advices!

Microarray problem
Hi,
I am working on a microarray project usign ﬁsh liver
as a source for RNA. I did Trizol extractions, including
2 isopropanol steps and 2 ethanol washes before dry-
ing and resuspending in RNase free water and RNase-
inhibitor. I then cleaned the extraction over a Microcon
ﬁlter. I measured the quantity of RNA, which is exactly
in the range of what we expect for liver. The 260-280
absorbance ratios are between 1.8 and 1.95, suggesting
no protein contamination. The 230-260 ratios are in
the same range, suggesting no phenol contamination.
After running the RNA on an Experion chip (same
as Bioanalyser), there is no sign of RNA contamina-
tion. There is, though, sign of genomic contamination,
showed by a little bump or “shoulder” after the 28S
peak (this is clearly not RNA degradation).
My samples have been ﬂash frozen in -80oC ethanol
(cooled by dry ice) but some ethanol entered the tubes,
which means that my samples have been in presenceMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 65
of ethanol for something like 3 months at -80oC. I do
believe that ethanol has penetrated the livers.
Now, I did microarrays (using Genisphere Array 50 kit)
with my samples and positive control samples (that had
already worked for microarrays). The controls worked
but not my samples, although I treated them exactly
the same way (I did the two in parallel). This test was
repeated twice with the same results. This excludes
the possibility of some reagent/kit/microarray not be-
ing functionnal.
I also proceeded to test the retro-transcription by run-
ning a quantitative PCR on the samples before and
after the retro-transcription. This shows that the RT
works well and that there could be a little bit of ge-
nomic DNA as well, but that one ensured only 1/1000
to 1/4000 times the amount of ampliﬁed material com-
pared to the cDNA after the retrotranscription.
And now the questions :
Would someone have any idea how to explain these re-
sults?
Can genomic DNA contamination afect the microarray,
even though the retro-transcription worked very well?
If yes, in what way? (hybridization, labelling...)
Could the presence of ethanol in the sample livers be
enough to ensure carry-over of genomic DNA in a Trizol
extraction?
Thanks very much for any help!

Microarray problem 2
Hi,
Following suggestions, I changed some information in
the description of my problem. If you answer (you can
do so at : eric.normandeau.1@ulaval.ca), please con-
sider this version. Thank you :)
I am working on a microarray project usign ﬁsh liveras a source for RNA. I did Trizol extractions, including
2 isopropanol steps and 2 ethanol washes before dry-
ing and resuspending in RNase free water and RNase-
inhibitor. I then cleaned the extraction over a Microcon
ﬁlter (YM-30). I measured the quantity of RNA, which
is exactly in the range of what we expect from liver.
The 260-280 absorbance ratios are between 1.8 and
1.95, suggesting no protein contamination. The 230-
260 ratios are in the same range, suggesting no phenol
contamination. After running the RNA on an Experion

degradation. There is, though, sign of genomic DNA
contamination, showed by a little bump or “shoulder”
after the 28S peak (this is clearly not RNA degrada-
tion).
My samples have been ﬂash frozen in -80oC ethanol
(cooled by dry ice) but some ethanol entered the tubes,
which means that my samples have been in presence
of ethanol for something like 3 months at -80oC. I do
believe that ethanol has penetrated the livers. Ethanol
is believed to increase carry-over of genomic DNA in a
phenol-chlorophorm RNA extraction.
Now, I did microarrays (using Genisphere Array 50 kit)
with my samples and positive control samples (that had
already worked for microarrays). The controls worked
but not my samples, although I treated them exactly
the same way (I did the two in parallel). ********On
the microarrays I did with my extractions, virtually
nothing shows on the array. It is even hard to see the
spots on the chip. So there is no signal for both channels
(Cy3 and Alexa).******** This test was repeated twice
with the same results. This excludes the possibility of
some reagent/kit/microarray not being functionnal.
I also proceeded to test the retro-transcription by run-
ning a quantitative PCR on the samples before and
after the retro-transcription. This shows that the RT
works well and that there could be a little bit of genomic
DNA as well. Without retro-transcription, only 1/1000
to 1/4000 times product was generated, compared to
the amount of ampliﬁed material from cDNA after the
retrotranscription. The primers and probe were de-
signed across an intron/exon limit, so they should not
be very eﬃcient in amplifying genomic DNA. Thus,
it is possible that there is a non-negligible amount of
genomic DNA in the sample when compared to the
mRNA quantity.
And now the questions :
Would someone have any idea how to explain these re-
sults? (failling microarrays in the context described?)

Microsatellite Alleles
I ampliﬁed and genotyped an individual DNA sample-
and found3 separatemicrosatellite alleles (as evidenced
by 3 separate peaks on the electropherogram output
from the 3730 Sequencer) at3 out of the 5 tetranu-
cleotide loci I am scoring. This same sample at theother
two loci havea “normal” 1 or 2 allele pattern. I thought
my sample may have been contaminated and so I re-
extracted and re-ampliﬁed my original DNA sample
with the same result, 3 peaks at 3 of the 5 loci. Has
anyone ever encountered this before (3 alleles at a lo-
cus) and have an explanation?I do not see3 peaks at
any loci for the other ~2000 DNA samples I have run.

Microtus brachycercus samples
Dear Evoldir members,
I saw recently in the new edition of “Mammal Species
of the World” by Wilson & Reeder that Microtus (Ter-
ricola) brachycercus, initially described as a subspecies
of M. savii, was elevated at the species rank on the
base of gonosomal diﬀerences and morphological traits.I am working on Microtus (Terricola) phylogeny. So I
would like to know if one of you could provide me with
some tissue samples of this vole in order to determine
its phylogenetic position.
Thanks in advance, Christelle Tougard.

Parentage problems
Hi,
I was hoping that somebody could help me with an
analysis in the program “Parentage”. According to the
manual, the program should able to cope with the sit-
uation that alleles were found in the tested families,
which do not occur in the population sample used for
calculating background frequencies.
>From the manual:
Freqmodel: Used to determine the modelling used for
sampling parents from background frequencies. The
models can be simple multinomial sampling if the back-
ground frequencies contain all the alleles that are seen
in the data, or multinomial-Dirichlet, if there are alle-
les in the data that are not in the background frequen-
cies. If background frequencies are not provided then
a multinomial-Dirichlet model should be used. Input
either 0 (Dirichlet) or 1 (multinomial) default 0
Using the setting freqmodel: 0, the program exits with
a polite excuse printed on the screen. Same with fre-
qmodel: 1, when I run the families with the ’extra’
alleles.
Increasing the population sample is not possible in the
short run, current N is about 50 individuals. All ﬁsh
(maternal families and population sample) were sam-
pled at the same location and the species is known to
be highly philopatric.
My questions: 1. If it is possible to use ’Parentage’ in
this situation, how do I get it to work?2. If Parentage can’t do it, is it safe to modify the in-
put to make it compatible with Parentage? This would
be based on the assumption that alleles present in the
families but not in the population sample have low fre-
quencies in the population. For example, there are some
inferred paternal alleles, which are missing from the
population sample. Is it ok to add fake genotypes to
the population sample, which would provide one copy
of each missing paternal allele; i.e. assign an arbitrary
low frequency to the missing alleles? Then, some of
the known mothers also carry alleles, which are missing
from the population sample. Can I include the mothers
in the population sample?

Particle counter sizer
Dear Evoldir members, I am in the process of purchas-
ing an instrument to count and measure the size of
particles. I will be using this mainly for pollen, al-
though some colleagues might want to use it to mea-
sure population growth of yeast. I have received bids
from three companies, and I would appreciate your
comments on any of them regarding 1) limitations of
the instrument, 2) diﬃculty level of samples prepara-
tion, 3) cleaning and maintenance, 4) user support, 5)
any other comments you may have. The instruments
are: a) Beckman-Coulter - Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter
b) Micromeritics (Folio Instruments Inc. in Canada)
- Elzone II 5390 Automated particle size analyzer c)
Brightwell Technologies (Spectra Research Corporation
in Canada) - DPA 4100 Micro Flow Imaging (MFI) Par-
ticle Analysis System
I am most familiar with b), and I understand a) uses
the same principle (and possibly was the original par-
ticle counter. I have no experience with c), and I am
particularly curious to hear from users who have gone
from a) or b) to using c).
I will be glad to collect and compile your messages
and send them back to the list for everybody’s ben-
eﬁt. Please send your responses to german.avila-

Phylemon web server
Dear members of EvolDir, we would like to inform you
that “Phylemon: a suite of web-tools for molecular evo-
lution, phylogenetics and phylogenomics” is available
at:
http://phylemon.bioinfo.cipf.es Phylemon is an online
platform for phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of
molecular sequence data. It has been developed as a
web server that integrates a suite of diﬀerent tools se-
lected among the most popular stand alone programs
in phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis. It has been
conceived as a natural response to the increasing de-
mand of data analysis of many experimental scientists
willing to add a molecular evolution and phylogenetics
insight into their research. Tools included in Phylemon
cover a wide range of programs, from the most basic
for multiple sequence alignment to elaborate statistical
methods of phylogenetic reconstruction and the evolu-
tionary analysis of rates to test adaptation in molecular
sequences. Phylemon has several features that diﬀeren-
tiates from other web servers:
1- It oﬀers an integrated environment that enables the
direct concatenation of evolutionary analyses, the stor-
age of results and the required data format conversions,
2- Once an outﬁle is produced, Phylemon suggests the
next possible analyses, thus guiding the user and fa-
cilitating the integration of multi-step analyses, and 3-
Users can deﬁne and save complete pipelines for spe-
ciﬁc phylogenetic analysis to be automatically used on
many genes in subsequent sessions or multiple genes in
a single session (phylogenomics).
The Phylemon web server is at http://-

Hi Everyone
I have been using a 10% Acrylamide gel to run PCR
products of approximately 96-100bp in size. In trying
to avoid using acrylamide, I have converted to use a
product call “QA agarose, high resolution” at 6% and
encountered some problems. Has anyone have any ex-
perience, with runnning fragments of approx. the above
size, using the QA agarose? I’d appreciate any input
at all on the matter.
Thank you.

I’ve used NuSieve agarose at 6% for fragments a little
bit bigger (150bp) - and this worked ﬁne for distinguish-
ing between fragments about 6 bp apart. I found that
the most important ’tricks’ are to make sure you heat
the agarose really well (and add it slowly to the buﬀer
so it does not clump) since it melts much more slowlyMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 71
than traditional agarose. Second is that you have to
run the gel much more slowly (not over 90v) to avoid
warping the fragments.
I hope this helps. Alexis
——
Every time I’ve tried using one of the supposed high-
resolution agaroses, I end up cursing them and going
back to acrylamide, though I’ve never used it at 10%;
we’ve gone as high as an 8% (0.35mm thickness)- to re-
solve microsatellite polymorphisms in fragments rang-
ing in size from 100-200bp. More recently, we tried
using NuSieve at 4%, but again, could not resolve the
size diﬀerences. And making gels that thick is a pain.
We have been silver-staining the acrylamide gels, but
will try a DNA stain called FMC Gel-Star.
I’m curious to know what sort of apparatus you are run-
ning your acrylamide gels in. We typically use the Bio-
Rad Sequi-Gen 38x30cm setup, because we can load 48
samples across. We tried using their protein-oriented
Protean II system, but the gels are thicker, and not set
up to run at high enough temperatures, or at least I
think that’s what our problem was. Bio-Rad tech sup-
port could oﬀer no help b/c they said the unit is meant
for proteins.
I’d very much like to know what your experience is, and
what you learn from others.
Best wishes, Bob Marra

We don’t use QA agarose but we do use NuSieve GTG
Agarose to resolve fragments that size. We usually use
2.8% gels to resolve fragments 80-120 bp in size. It is
low melting too so you can cut out the bands and use
them for reampliﬁcation, cloning etc.

Qvalue vs Bonferroni
[Note: this message will be posted on Evoldir, Ecolog-
L, and the popbiol listervs, and I apologize in advance if
you get multiple copies. I will post summaries of replies
to all three lists.]
I am try to get a sense of whether a consensus is devel-oping among evolutionary and population biologists on
the use of the “false discovery rate” (Q-value) in mul-
tiple comparisons instead of the various forms of the
Bonferroni correction. Since Rice’s 1989 paper (Evolu-
tion 43:223), the Bonferroni correction has been widely
used for adjusting the signiﬁcance level of multiple com-
parisons to minimize type I errors. In fact, in some
ﬁelds, as I have learned the hard way, it has become
a virtual requirement for publication. But with these
corrections, the power of the analyses are lowered, per-
haps artiﬁcially and unnecessarily, and some biologists
have argued that they probably should not be used (e.g.
Moran,2003; Oikos 100:443). My own work often in-
volves large numbers of comparisons of gene frequen-
cies by chi-square or related statistics, to evaluate the
signiﬁcance of allelic frequency diﬀerences among popu-
lations or the potential reality of linkage disequilibrium
detected by programs like LinkDos. I have used the
Bonferroni correction in the past, but often with the
feeling that I was throwing many babies out with the
bathwater, especially with preliminary surveys, which
are often “ﬁshing expeditions.”
It seems to me that use of the Q value instead of
the Bonferroni correction could restore a great deal of
power to multiple comparisons. [see Verhoeven et al.,
2005; Oikos 108:643 for a discussion and review of lit-
erature]. Yet I see relatively few papers, particularly
in population genetics, that use the Q value, and many
that still use the Bonferroni correction. Of course, this
apparent delay could simply reﬂect the fact that most
papers that are in the curent issues of journals were
submitted around a year ago or more. Or it could sim-
ply stem from the conservatism of research communities
(including referees of journal articles) that don’t spend
a lot of time worrying about type I vs type II errors.
I cordially invite comment from anyone who has a view-
point or experience with this issue. Bruce J. Turner

SSB Graduate Student Research
Awards
Awards for Graduate Student Research
The Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) announces
its sixth annual Graduate Student Research Award
competition. The purpose of these awards is to as-72 EvolDir March 1, 2007
sist students in the ﬁrst two years of their systemat-
ics projects and in the collection of preliminary data
needed to pursue additional sources of support (e.g.,
Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants from the
National Science Foundation) or to enhance disserta-
tion research (e.g., by visiting additional ﬁeld collection
sites or museums). Applicants may be from any coun-
try, but must be members of SSB, and are advised to
join the Society as soon as possible to facilitate their ap-
plications (to join go to: http://systbiol.org/join.html ).
Previous awardees may not re-apply, but previous ap-
plicants who were not selected for funding are eligible.
Awards will range between $1,000 and $2000.
Applicants must submit 1) a curriculum vitae (one
page) 2) brief research proposal including objectives,
methods, signiﬁcance, and schedule (max. three single-
spaced pages including literature cited and any ﬁgures
and tables) 3) budget and budget justiﬁcation (1 page)
4) and arrange for two letters of recommendation; one
letter must be from the student’s current graduate ad-
visor.
The research proposal must clearly state the current
stage of the proposed research and the current year
and status of the student. Please include e-mail con-
tacts for the applicant in the application itself. Both
Masters and Ph.D. students are eligible. Systematics
is interpreted broadly to include questions below and
above the species level, molecular and morphological
approaches, and issues of pattern and process. Funding
is not limited to any particular aspect of research, but
rather is available for ﬁeld, museum/herbarium, and/or
laboratory work.
All applications materials must be in electronic format.

GeneiousPlugin
Bayesian phylogenetics without tears!
I am pleased to announce the availability of a free Mr-
Bayes plugin for the Geneious molecular sequence plat-
form. Running on top of Geneious (version 2.5.4 or
greater), this plug-in provides:
An easy-to-use graphical interface for performing
Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction using MrBayes.
One can seamlessly integrate blast searches, multiple
sequence alignment and Bayesian phylogenetic recon-
struction with simple clicks of the mouse. Currently
available through the plug-in are the nucleotide- and
codon-based models, JC, HKY, GTR and CodonM0,
all with or without molecular clock assumptions, and
invariant and site- speciﬁc rate variation.
Importantly, the plug-in also provides interactive
graphical viewers to examine the resulting posterior dis-
tributions. These viewers generate publication-quality
summaries of the tree and other model parameter dis-
tributions, including:
1. Marginal summary statistics, histograms and density
plots, 2. Bi-variate correlation plots to explore hidden
structure in the posterior, and 3. Eﬀective sample size
estimates and time-series plots to assess convergence.
The plug-in is open source, so researchers interested in
extending it should contact me (msuchard@ucla.edu)
to receive the source code. While the current choices
of reconstruction models are limited, up- coming exten-
sions include:
1. multiple data partitions, 2. amino acid models, 3.
ﬂexible prior speciﬁcation, and 4. site-speciﬁc codon
models with direct plotting of positive selection proba-
bilities in Geneious.
Following the cross-platform ideal of Geneious for
molecular sequence analysis, the plug-in runs under
Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

Software MSA
A new version of the Microsatellite Analyzer (MSA) has
just been uploaded. MSA is a user friendly, platform
independent software for the analysis of microsatellite
data.
New features: - Estimates the variance in FST in rela-
tion to a speciﬁed number of loci. This feature is helpful
to compare QST and FST if an estimate for the num-
ber of loci aﬀecting the trait is available. - Generation
of an input ﬁle for the IM Software (Hey & Nielsen)
- GST and GST, which allows the comparison of loci
with diﬀerent levels of variability (Hedrick 2005) - Al-
lelic richness - moment estimator beta (Weir & Hill) -
ﬁle conversion to: IM (Hey & Nielsen)
Further features of MSA are:
ADVANTAGES Simple input format With only a few
modiﬁcations the output ﬁle of a genotyping software
could be converted into a MSA input ﬁle
Large data ﬁles are allowed Within the limits of avail-
able memory, no constraints on the number of loci
Platform independent Executables for Mac and PC are
available
FEATURES Calculates basic summaries (e.g. observed
and expected heterozygosity, number of alleles, ex-
pected number of alleles, variance in PCR product size,
variance in repeat number
Several genetic distances are calculated (including Fst,
delta mu squared, proportion of shared alleles, Neis dis-
tances etc.) Bootstrap and permutation options are
available to test for statistical signiﬁcance. Distances
can be calculated for populations, individuals, across
loci and for each locus separately.
Provides input ﬁles for other software (e.g.: Arlequin,
Structure, Migrate)
Random discarding of alleles: this option is use-
ful for researchers working with inbred strains (e.g.:
Drosophila isofemale lines)

Tissue Storage for Morphological
work
Please excuse the cross-posting.
I would like to know about any recent literature
and people’s personal experiences with storing speci-
mens, particularly insects and spiders, for morpholog-
ical work. There has been recent discussion regarding
tissue preservation for molecular work which appeared
to come to a consensus (majority rule?) that 95-100%
EtOH and -80 degrees C is optimal. But this is not
optimal for morphological work. Moreover, many of us
do both molecular and morphological work and need to
ﬁnd a balance.
Personally, I like to have a long series of specimens that
can be stored in several diﬀerent ways for diﬀerent pur-74 EvolDir March 1, 2007
poses (I work with insects so I can do this). But for soft-
bodied critters (spiders, termites, larvae, etc.) and/or
the very small (mites, aphids, etc.), what do people rec-
ommend for collection and storage? The answer to this
will be somewhat dependent on the taxon (eg. cater-
pillars often turn black if killed in EtOH and should
be killed in very hot water), and what the ultimate
purpose will be (eg. study of internal organs, clearing-
staining-slide mounting, etc.). Meanwhile, new meth-
ods are continually being tested (and old ones remem-
bered).
Given all these caveats, I would like to hear your opin-
ions, experiences, references and preferences.
Please reply oﬀ list and I will compile the results and
repost.
Thank you,

Tripneustes samples
Dear all EvolDir users,
We are studying the large scale population structure
of Tripneustes gratilla, a sea urchin species distributed
all over the Paciﬁc and Indian Ocean, as well as the
Red Sea. We are looking to expand our sample sizes,
and we would like to know if one of you could provide
us with some tissue samples of this species in order to
achieve better resolution for our analyses. So far we
were collecting a couple of tubular feet kept in ethanol.
Thanks in advance, Catherine Lipp´ e.

Trizol RNA extraction
Hi all,
I do microarray work with Atlantic salmon livers. I
collected my samples by putting the livers in cryotubes
and ﬂash freeze them in ethanol that was at -80C. Un-
fortunately, the tubes took some ethanol in and now
my small livers (50-150mg) (as well as brains, white
muscle and whole ﬁsh) have been in presence of small
amounts of 95% pure ethanol for some time. Their is
good reason to believe that the ethanol has penetrated
the tissues.
I did Trizol RNA extractions with some of these livers,
whipping the excess ethanol before putting the samples
in Trizol and homogenizing them. Following the normal
microarray protocol (Array 50 kit from Genisphere), I
did 2 chips. 1 control with material from an extraction
that had successfully used for microarray and one with
2 of my samples. The control is superb whereas mine
didnt work.
My only suspect is the sample itself, and its only par-
ticularity is this presence of ethanol in the tubes.Anyone has any reason to suspect how this ethanol
could be bad for the retro-transcription of mRNAs in
cDNAs, the hybridization of cDNAs on the chip or hy-
bridization of the ﬂuorochromes on the cDNAs, I’d be
more than happy to know.
I also need a way of getting rid of the ethanol from all
my samples. Some have suggested to put them in RNA
later so as to extract the ethanol. Would that work?
Cheers and thanks a lot

cDNA AFLP fragments
Hi all,
I am currently working with cDNA AFLP and I get
some troubles at re-amplifying the long fragments gen-
erated by the technique (beyond 400 bp). My selective
ampliﬁcation products are electrophoresed on polyacry-
lamide gels and silver-stained according to the proce-
dures used by Bassam et al (1991).
I collect the fragment of interest by scraping gel away
from around band of choice, then let sit the fragment
in 50 ul sterile 1X TE buﬀet at least 5 hours in 4C.
After this step, I set up PCR reactions with appropri-
ate primers and use 5 ul of the designer DNA as the
target.
Finally, I load a 2% agarose gel for conﬁrmation of the
presence of the correct band.
So far, I have not been able to extract and reamplify
the fragments above 400 bp.
Too much of the silver stained fragment could inhibit
the PCR reaction? In vain, I tried to set the PCR re-
action with diﬀerent kind of Taq. Maybe the largest
fragments can’t get out of the gel. I tried longer time
and various temperatures when letting sit in the 1X
TE.. No better results.
I’d appreciate any advice or comment on the question.

POSTDOC JOB IN BARCELONA: GENETIC AR-
CHITECTURE OF SPECIATION
A postdoctoral position is available to study genetic ar-
chitecture of hybrid male sterility in Drosophila. Work
in our lab has shown that experiments using intro-
gressed hybrids support that the threshold additive
model (apparently many genetic additive factors) is the
most plausible to explain hybrid sterility. However,
these results do not discard the existence of unique fac-
tors of major eﬀect and/or epistatic interactive factors
mapping in diﬀerent chromosomes. We plan to satu-
rate the genome with species speciﬁc AFLP markers in
order to detect candidate sequences responsible for hy-
brid sterility. At the moment we have selected at least
20 AFLP markers associated to hybrid male sterility
that are being sequenced and mapped to unveil can-
didate genes. Combining genomic, molecular, cytoge-
netic and bioinformatic techniques we want to distin-
guish between additive and epistatic actions of these
genetic factors. This work is carried out in hybrids
between D. koepferae and D. buzzatii, but we plan to
extend it to other species pairs in earlier stages of diﬀer-
entiation. Applicants must have either a strong back-
ground in Drosophila molecular evolutionary genetics
or in molecular genetics with a high interest in evolution
and speciation. Applicants must contact immediately
Dr. Antonio Fontdevila sending a cover letter, a CV
and the names, aﬃliation, address, e-mail address, and
telephone number of two persons of reference. Dead-
line for submission is March 5, but immediate notice is
encouraged. Annual salary range is 24750-32600 euros
(before taxes) and duration is 3-5 years. The success-
ful applicant is expected to start working on September
2007 (or earlier), but, if justiﬁed, his/her incorporation
can be delayed.

Application deadline 28th February 2007.
EU funded positions, salary dependent on EU experi-
enced researcher qualiﬁcations: £28,000 (Marie Curie
Fellow 1) or £41,928 p.a., (Marie Curie Fellow 2). Each
position is for 24 months.
In a global economy, the transfer of parasites to novel
hosts can pose a major threat to both farmed and wild
animal stocks. The eﬀects of parasite invasion can have
signiﬁcant impacts on rural economies and biodiversity,
but are diﬃcult to evaluate in the short-term, since
adaptation to new hosts occurs over an evolutionary
time-scale. This project will study neutral genetic vari-
ation and adaptive evolution of morphology and viru-
lence of gyrodactylid parasites associated with histori-
cal translocations of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata).
This group of ﬁsh-parasites may comprise ca. 20,000
species, the majority of which are still unknown to sci-
ence. Gyrodactylids are renowned for their coloniza-
tion abilities and pathogenicity, and one species alone,
Gyrodactylus salaris has cost the Norwegian Salmon In-
dustry >500 million in 25 years. Gyrodactylids demon-
strate biological plasticity including host-shifts, an evo-
lutionary characteristic important for parasite invasion.
We will utilize a multi-disciplinary approach integrat-
ing morphometrics, molecular ecology and experimen-
tal parasitology to identify and describe novel species,
to study their invasion potential, and to establish DNA
barcoding for this group.
The successful candidates must have PhDs and have
a strong background in evolutionary biology, genetics,
ecology and/or epidemiology. They will join a team
of parasitologists (Cardiﬀ and Oslo) and evolutionary
biologists (Cardiﬀ and Hull) engaged in a four year
Transfer of Knowledge (ToK) Marie Curie Programme
(GYROSCOPE). The successful candidates will both
be based in Cardiﬀ for two years, but there will be
the possibility of short periods of ﬁeldwork in Trinidad
and/or Tobago. For Marie Curie Fellow 1, expertise
in parasitology/microscopy or molecular biology is re-
quired. For Marie Curie Fellow 2, experience of mi-
crosatellite, AFLP and/or SNP analysis is essential.
To compile with EU ToK appointment regulations, UK
candidates are not eligible, unless they have worked
outside the country for the last ﬁve years.

Population genomics of human immune response: ge-
netic diversity and natural selection
A postdoctoral position is available in the Unit of Hu-
man Evolutionary Genetics directed by Lluis Quintana-
Murci, in the Department of Genomes and Genetics at
Institut Pasteur in Paris ( www.pasteur.fr ). Research
projects in our lab focus on empirical and modeling
studies of the role of population demography and natu-
ral selection in shaping the patterns of human genome
variability. We are particularly interested in the study
and dissection of the relative inﬂuence of population
history, variable temporal and geographic host expo-
sure to pathogen pressures, and diﬀerent lifestyles (fromhunter-gathering to farming economy) on the patterns
of variability of human immunity-related loci. We focus
on genes or gene families involved in innate immunity,
which constitutes the ﬁrst line of host defence against
pathogens (ex. Toll-like receptors, C-type lectins, scav-
enger receptors, etc.). These studies, which integrate
molecular biology, population genetics and bioinformat-
ics, will allow us to determine the extent to which nat-
ural selection has shaped the patterns of variation of
these genes, and to identify those genes or gene fam-
ilies, variations in which may aﬀect susceptibility to
infectious diseases. Institut Pasteur hosts geneticists,
microbiologists, immunologists and computational bi-
ologists under this broad research agenda, providing a
working interdisciplinary research environment.
The candidate should be highly motivated, with good
communication skills and a high level of commitment.
He/She is expected to have a Ph.D. in the relevant
ﬁeld (population genetics, genomics, human genetics),
and a strong background in molecular genetics and/or
population genetics. Bioinformatics and computational
skills are desirable. A willingness to engage in inter-
disciplinary research in population genetics, evolution
and immunology is essential. The starting date is ne-
gotiable, but the position is available immediately.

EvolOfHandednessInHumans
Evolution of handedness in human populations
Institute of Evolutionary Sciences of Montpellier
(France) CNRS UMR 5554
Part 1. Social status and handedness Social status
is a ﬁtness component in humans, as in other social
species with dominance relationships. Associations be-
tween socio-economic status and handedness have been
found in a western society in a population of children
and in several large cohorts of adults. We propose to
investigate this relation in other cultures, especially in
traditional or sub-traditional societies that have not ex-
perienced the demographic transition.
Part 2. Sex and handedness There are more left-handed
men than women, in most societies so far investigated.
Why left-handed women still exist is not well under-
stood, in light of the advantage found, in ﬁghting in-
teractions, which does not concern women. One pos-
sible explanation is an indirect advantage for women,
through their sons, because there is a maternal compo-
nent in the inheritance of left-handedness. This aspect
has only been explored theoretically, and requires em-
pirical evidence.
These two parts are to be completed with other aspects,
according to competence and expertise, e.g. the tem-
poral variation of handedness (through bilateral asym-
metries in past remains), and the investigation of the
evolutionary causes of historical and geographical vari-ations.
Duration: 24 months (including at least 6 months of
ﬁeld work)
Salary: monthly, net : 1430-1741 (according to expe-
rience)
Application: CV, list of publications, names and email

The project aims at understanding the historical and
selective determinants of the diﬀerentiation of the house
mouse subspecies, leading to partial incompatibility
and reproductive isolation. The approach will combine
the study of the patterns of coalescence of genes within
and among subspecies with that of the patterns of intro-
gression across a hybrid zone between the subspecies,
and will take advantage of the growing knowledge of
the mouse genome sequence variation and functional
genomics. The team has long experience in mouse pop-
ulation biology, population genetics, chromosome evo-
lution, archaeological, morphometric and behavioural
studies. A large collection of mouse DNA samples and
wild-derived strains are available for the project. The
project is funded by ANR (Agence Nationale pour la
Recherche). The Post-Doc will work in direct collab-
oration with one researcher (Dr. Pierre Boursot), one
bench-work technician, and one PhD student.

for robotics, automatic capillary sequencing and real-
time PCR, as well as computer clusters, with dedicated
staﬀ for operation and assistance. Montpellier is a hot
spot for evolutionary biology, biodiversity and genomic
studies in France.
Candidates should have a strong background in molec-
ular population genetics and/or molecular genetics.
Skills in bioinformatics and programming are desirable.
Experience of high throughput polymorphism detection
methods would also be favourable. Strong motivation,
communication skills and commitment are expected.
The position is for one year with possible extension,

Oxford University: Protozoan Molecular Evolution
3 year NERC-funded postdoctoral position supervised
by Professor T. Cavalier-Smith FRS in the Department
of Zoology
Starting 1 October 2007. Open to all with a recent PhD
in an appropriate biological subject or who expect to
be awarded one before 1st October 2007.
THE PROJECT: Evolution, biodiversity, and molecu-
lar ecology of apusozoan protozoa
Remarkably little is known of the biology, species di-
versity, and ecology of the recently established phylum
Apusozoa, which are free-living predators on bacteria
in all major habitats. The position of this phylum in
the eukaryote phylogenetic tree is also obscure, as they
do not clearly belong to any of the recently deﬁned
six major assemblages of eukaryotes, and might repre-
sent a distinct lineage, possibly being the most diver-
gent among bikont eukaryotes. Whether the ﬁve groups
currently assigned to this phylum (apusomonads, ancy-
romonads, breviates, diphylleids, Micronuclearia) are
all genuinely mutually related is also controversial.
A keen and independently minded postdoctoral re-
searcher with experience in PCR, DNA sequencing and
phylogenetic analysis is sought for two related projects:
[1] testing the relationships of all the major apusozoan
groups by multigene phylogenies; and [2] studying the
biodiversity and habitat preferences of each of them by
subgroup-speciﬁc PCR and sequencing of environmen-
tal DNA samples and isolation of new cultures. Skills in
bioinformatic methods and/or an interest in protozoa
and microscopy or cell evolution (or in learning much
more about them) are desirable.
We provide an excellent environment for this research,84 EvolDir March 1, 2007
as the postdoctoral researcher will work alongside a
graduate student carrying out EST sequencing projects
on apusozoans, with much opportunity for exchange of
ideas and mutual help, and several other experienced
researchers in the lab are using similarly diverse ap-
proaches for two large and important protozoan phyla:
Amoebozoa and Cercozoa.
The appointment will be on the RA1A scale (Grade 7
starting at £25,889 per annum) and subject to a pro-
bationary period.

Postdoctoral Position: Phylogenetics of Hawaiian Song-bird Lineages
A postdoctoral research position to conduct molecular
and morphological phylogenetic analyses of Hawaiian
songbird lineages is available for up to two years begin-
ning as early as June 2007 (the second year of funding
is contingent upon satisfactory performance in the ﬁrst
year). Most of the species under study are extinct or
endangered, so museum specimen and subfossil bone
material will be analyzed using “ancient DNA” meth-
ods. Applicants should have a background in molecu-
lar methods (PCR, DNA sequencing) and phylogenetic
analysis. Experience with ancient DNA methods and
morphological character analysis are a plus. Some pa-
leontological ﬁeldwork in Hawaii is expected, as well
as museum sampling visits. Please send a letter of
application detailing your experience in the relevant
areas, a full curriculum vitae, examples of your work
(pdfs), and the names, addresses, phone numbers and
email addresses of at least two references who know
your research experience and abilities. Research will

GeneticDataAnalysis
A new project, funded by Science Foundation Ire-
land Research Frontiers programme, requires a suit-
ably qualiﬁed post-doctoral candidate. The focus of
the project is the study of the spread of the Neolithic
in Europe.
The project requires substantial study in the area of
genetics, but will include archeology and perhas lin-
guistics. As it is relatively unstructured with regard to
the exact statistical methods required, the ideal candi-
date will have considerable experience of independent
research. The ideal candidate would be well-versed in
Bayesian methods and may have some background in
the study of genetic data.

Position for a Post-Doc (or a PhD -student) at the Sec-
tion of Ecology, Turku University
I’m looking for a highly motivated person with a sub-
stantiated interest in evolutionary ecology for a Post-
doc (or a PhD) post on marine alga-grazer interactions.
The research focuses on feeding strategies of littoral
mesoherbivores (isopods and amphipods). The main re-
search issues are 1) how the variation in feeding strate-
gies of herbivores translates into variation in their ﬁt-
ness, 2) how feeding strategies and the host exploitation
ability vary in a system of naturally fragmented, geo-
graphically separated populations, and 3) what is the
evolutionary potential of feeding strategies. The nearby
research environment, the brackish-water Archipelago
Sea at the southwestern coast of Finland, with over 20
000 islands with a varying level of isolation provides a
unique environment for research on species interactions
in the rocky littoral habitat.
The person I am looking for can be either at the stage of
initiating PhD -studies, or, may have a PhD on related
issues (plant-herbivore interactions, optimal foraging,
benthic ecology). The position is available from March-
April, initially to the end of the year 2007, with a possi-
bility for extension for additional two years conditional
to continuation of funding. Salary for a postdoc will be
about 2300-2700 eur/month, and for a PhD -student
1700-2300 eur/month depending on performance.
Details on the research environment can be

UAdelaide PlantBiogeography
Postdoc in plant biogeography
A highly motivated candidate is sought to undertake
a 2.5 year postdoctoral research position in plant bio-
geography.
The role of long distance dispersal in the evolution of
the Australasian and southwest Paciﬁc ﬂora is hotly
contended, but appropriate tests of alternative hy-
potheses are still lacking. This position will develop
a new comparative method for biogeography, combin-
ing phylogeny, fossils, mutation rate estimation, and
statistical analysis tools. This approach will be applied
to the Podocarpaceae, southern pines, to test central
premises of biogeographic theory, examine diﬀerences
in long distance dispersal dynamics and evolutionary
potential between groups, and coincidence with major
past geological or climatic changes.
Speciﬁcally the postdoc will be expected to :
1. Integrate existing phylogenetic data on
Podocarpaceae and undertake new sampling, phy-
logenetic and phylogeographic analysis for speciﬁc
groups. 2. Integrate existing macro and fossil pollen
data for Podocarpaceae 3. Examine the utility of pre-
served macrofossil sequences for developing mutation
rate analyses using ancient DNA 4. Develop statistical
methods for long distance dispersal and divergence
time estimations to test the inﬂuence of geogological
and climatic changes in the Australasian and SW
Pacﬁc region

POSTDOC IN POPULATION GENETICS, UNIVER-
SITY OF ARIZONA
A postdoctoral position in population genetics is avail-
able in Michael Hammer’s group at the University of
Arizona.
Research projects are ﬂexible and can be tailored to suit
individual interests. However, they must contribute to
the group’s overall focus. Current studies include in-
ferring human demographic history from genomic data
(primarily DNA re-sequencing datasets), and distin-
guishing the roles of natural selection and demographic
processes in shaping patterns of genomic variability.
Our research group already hosts geneticists, computa-
tional biologists, applied mathematicians and anthro-
pologists under this broad research agenda, and pro-
vides a working interdisciplinary research environment.
A major resource of the lab is a large, novel DNA
re-sequencing database that represents 90 independent
regions of the genome. Each ’neutral’ genomic re-
gion, spanning approximately 20kb, maps to regions of
moderate to high recombination far from coding DNA.
Sampling is consistent across each genomic region and
includes data from several indigenous populations in
Africa, Eurasia and the Americas. Additional projects
focus on sequencing candidate genes for complex traits
such as resistance to disease and skin pigmentation on
the same sample panel as the ’neutral’ genomic regions.
This study design creates an essentially unique genomic
dataset.
Our group enjoys close ties with the laboratory of Jef-
frey Wall at USC as well as other labs at the University
of Arizona, notably those of Michael Nachman (EEB),
Joseph Watkins (Math) and Stephen Lansing (Anthro-
pology). Moreover, it beneﬁts from an excellent ex-
tended community of researchers in population genet-
ics, computer science, statistics and genomics at the
University of Arizona.
Applicants for the position must have: a PhD in rel-
evant ﬁeld; a graduation date no later than 30 April
2007; training in evolutionary biology and/or popula-
tion genetics; a background in either theoretical popu-
lation genetics or a quantitative ﬁeld such as statistics
with a strong interest in genetics; and advanced com-
putational skills, including at least one programmingMarch 1, 2007 EvolDir 87
language.
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in
theoretical population genetics or in relevant areas of
mathematics and statistics, skills in computer model-
ing by simulation or exact mathematical analysis, and
be self-motivated and independent.
This position includes outstanding UA beneﬁts includ-
ing health, dental, and life insurance; paid vacation,
sick leave, and holidays; UA/ASU/NAU tuition reduc-
tion for the employee and qualiﬁed family members;
access to UA recreation and cultural activities; state
retirement; and more.

“Biogeography, ecology and conservation of terrestrial
vertebrates in a changing world”
Division of Biological Sciences, University of California
San Diego
DESCRIPTION: One NSF funded postdoctoral
position (two years) will be available starting
spring/summer 2007 to work on the conservation
and broad-scale ecology of terrestrial vertebrates. The
research will draw on a number of ecological, envi-
ronmental, phylogenetic and distributional databases.
An intended core focus will be the impacts of global
environmental change on species’ ranges, and their
associated ecological and evolutionary context. There
are some obvious additional research opportunities,
and there is potential for the postdoctoral scientist to
develop new directions.
RESEARCH GROUP: The position is based in the Lab
of Walter Jetz. In this group, the successful candi-
date will interact with two PhD students (broad-scale
conservation of mammals and birds, macroecology of
vertebrate energy use), two aﬃliated postdoctoral fel-
lows (cross-scale bioenergetic models of herptiles, global
biogeography of vertebrates), and several graduate and
undergraduate level students. There is the potential to
develop and co-supervise undergraduate and graduate
research projects.
LOCATION: University of California, San Diego. The
position is based at the Section of Ecology, Behavior
& Evolution in the Division of Biological Sciences - a
research community of ca. 100 faculty (including 14
members of the National Academy), 140 postdoctoral
fellows, and 250 graduate students, which is further
strengthened by the neighboring Scripps Institute of
Oceanography.REQUIREMENTS: A Ph.D. in ecology, biogeography
or evolution with research experience in the analysis of
spatial data and strong quantitative skills. Evidence of

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP *** THE UNI-
VERSITY OF CHICAGO
Contingent on anticipated ﬁnal approval of NSF fund-
ing, a postdoctoral fellowship will be available with a
negotiable starting date, but preferably between 1 June
2007 and 1 September 2007.
The postdoctoral scholar will participate in an ongoing
project to elucidate the role of transposable elements
in the evolution of heat-shock genes in natural popula-
tions. Prior work in the lab has discovered that trans-
posable elements are abundant, diverse, and consequen-
tial in the proximal promoter regions of many heat-
shock genes of Drosophila melanogaster (see, for exam-
ple, PLoS Genetics Vol. 2, No. 10, e165) , probably due
to the unique chromatin organization of heat-shock pro-
moters (see, for example, Genetics 178:809-820 (2006)).
Next steps will involve tests of the generality of these
ﬁndings by examining species progressively more dis-
tantly related to Drosophila melanogaster, and by ex-
amining the phenotypes of recently-discovered transpo-
son insertions.
The ideal candidate will be a recent Ph.D. with ex-
pertise in informatics, basic molecular biology (PCR,March 1, 2007 EvolDir 89
sequencing, cloning, cell transfection, reporter con-
structs), and/or Drosophila genetics and phenotype
analysis – or interests in and aptittude for acquiring
these skills and others as needed. Also important is
interest in interacting with a diverse and large com-
munity of scholars and trainees, including evolutionary
biologists ( http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ceb/ http://-
pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/ ), geneticists ( http:/-
/cg.bsd.uchicago.edu/ ,http://cg.bsd.uchicago.edu/-
), and integrative and systems biologists ( http://-
pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/ ).
Appointment will be intially for 12 months at an an-
nual salary of approximately $37,000 plus fringe ben-
eﬁts, and be renewable contingent on satisfactory per-
formance and availability of funding. The University of
Chicago is an Aﬃrmative Action/Equal Opportunity

UFlorida Adaptive Life History Evol
A postdoctoral position at the University of Florida
is available to study the physiological basis of adaptive
shifts in life history timing in the apple maggot, Rhago-
letis pomonella.
R. pomonella is a model system for studying the evo-
lution of insect-host plant associations and sympatric
speciation. Historically, R. pomonella larvae fed on
the fruits of hawthorns (Crataegus sp.) but radiated
onto domesticated apple (Malus pumila) after its in-
troduction to North America. In areas where both
hosts occur, apple and hawthorn populations form ge-
netically distinguishable host races. The timing and
depth of diapause (overwintering dormancy) are criti-
cal life-history traits diﬀerentially adapting apple and
hawthorn-infesting populations of R. pomonella to dif-
ferences in the fruiting times of their respective hosts,
generating reproductive isolation in the process. Phys-
iological traits such as nutrient storage and metabolic
rate aﬀect diapause length and timing in other insects.
We will test the hypothesis that adaptive diﬀerences in
diapause length between the apple and hawthorn host
races are mediated by energetics, particularly the ac-
cumulation of metabolic fuel prior to diapause and its
utilization during diapause.
We will determine the functional importance of nutrient
storage and metabolism to diapause length and timing90 EvolDir March 1, 2007
for apple and hawthorn host races of R. pomonella in
the ﬁeld and lab; and then equate any observed dif-
ference in fuel storage, body size, and metabolic rate
with allelic variation at loci that have diverged between
the host races. Linking allele frequencies to diapause-
associated nutrient storage and metabolism will provide
the basis for our ultimate goal of identifying the speciﬁc
physiological, biochemical, and genetic alterations un-
derlying adaptive host plant-mediated life history evo-
lution in the two R. pomonella host races.
The postdoc will join Dan Hahn’s group in the Depart-
ment of Entomology and Nematology at the Univer-
sity of Florida ( http://danhahn.ifas.uﬂ.edu/ ) and will
have signiﬁcant interactions with Jeﬀ Feder’s group in
the Department of Biological Sciences at Notre Dame
(http://www.nd.edu/˜biology/JeﬀreyFeder.shtml ).
Ideally a candidate would start in June 2007. Salary
and beneﬁts will range between $33,000 and $40,000
and are available for 3 years, contingent on perfor-
mance. Excellent family medical/dental health plans
are available. Applicants should provide a formal letter
of application, a complete biographical CV, transcripts

UMaryland HumanEvolGenomics
Postdoctoral Positions in Human Evolutionary Ge-
nomics
Postdoctoral positions are available in a human pop-
ulation genetics laboratory in the Department of Bi-
ology at the University of Maryland at College Park
for NIH and NSF funded research. Projects in the
lab focus on a unique resource of >6,000 DNA sam-
ples from ~100 ethnically and geographically diverse
African populations. These samples are being used for
genome-level analyses of diversity at both coding and
non-coding loci (including high throughput resequenc-
ing and whole genome SNP and STRP genotyping).
For many of these samples we also have phenotype
data for a number of traits that are likely important
in adaptation, including those with a complex pattern
of inheritance. We are using these data (1) to infer
population structure and demographic history and test
models of modern human evolution (2) to identify re-March 1, 2007 EvolDir 91
gions of the genome that are targets of selection us-
ing whole genome scans (3) to identify functionally sig-
niﬁcant variants using genotype/phenotype association
studies as well as gene expression analyses (4) to study
the genetic basis of resistance against infectious dis-
ease (with a focus on malaria) and co-evolution of the
human and Plasmodium falciparum genomes. Collab-
orators on these projects include Jonathan Pritchard,
Molly Przeworski, Carlos Bustamante, Josh Akey, Greg
Wray, Philip Awadalla, Gil McVean, and Anna Tra-
montano. Additional information about the Tishkoﬀ

Postdoctoral Position
Community/Ecosystem Genetics and Chemical Ecol-
ogy
University of Wisconsin - Madison
A postdoctoral Research Associate position will be
available summer 2007 as part of a large, multi-
investigator, multi-institutional project funded un-
der NSFs Frontiers in Integrative Biological Research
(FIBR) program. This research explores the genetic
basis of community dynamics and ecosystem processes.
Speciﬁcally, it evaluates how genetic and chemical vari-
ation in naturally occurring and synthetic hybrids of
cottonwood species mediates ecological structure and
function at population, community and ecosystem lev-
els. (See the feature article on genes to ecosystemsby Whitham et al. [2006. Nature Reviews Genet-
ics 7:510-523].) Field sites include a number of ri-
parian habitats throughout the Intermountain West.
Project PIs include T.G. Whitham, S. Shuster, C.A.
Gehring, G.J. Allan, J.C. Marks, S.C. Hart, P.S. Keim,
R.L. Lindroth, S.P. DiFazio, and B.M. Potts. For
more information about the collaborative project, go to:
http://www.poplar.nau.edu/ Primary responsibilities
of the Research Associate are to coordinate and con-
duct the chemically-related components of the research
program. Collaborative projects underway relate cot-
tonwood chemistry to arthropod communities, mycor-
rhizal communities, mammalian foraging, and litter de-
composition. Results from this work will be integrated
with that of other project coordinators to understand
the inﬂuence of cottonwood genetic structure on chem-
ical variation, and the linkages between chemical vari-
ation and community and ecosystem function at local
and regional scales. The Research Associate will also
be expected to initiate and conduct research projects
related to his/her area of expertise (e.g., quantitative
genetics, G x E interactions, etc.)
Qualiﬁcations include expertise in plant chemical anal-
yses and/or quantitative genetics, and interest in the
chemical ecology of trophic interactions and ecosystem
function. Strong interpersonal, laboratory, statistical
and writing skills are essential. Extended collecting
trips to ﬁeld sites in the western U.S. will likely be
required.

of a common project that will evaluate the eﬃciency of
molecular markers as a tool for improved breeding of
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). One position is directed
towards development of molecular marker techniques
(SNP and AFLP) and the other towards development
of statistical methods, but opportunities for collabo-
ration both within the project and with other groups
exists. The positions will be situated at Ume˚ a Plant
Science Centre, SLU, Sweden, which is a very strong
research institution for plant molecular biology and for-
est genetics. The net salary is based on a stipend (17
500 SEK/month). The positions will be open until the
right candidates have been found.
(1) The molecular marker position aims at ﬁnding SNP
and AFLP markers for breeding traits in one of the
most advance breeding populations of Scots pine in
Sweden. The applicant should have a PhD in molec-
ular genetics and preferably be familiar with SNP and
AFLP marker development. Experience in conifer ge-
netics and knowledge of quantitative genetics is posi-
tive, but not mandatory.

Post-doctoral position at the Evolutionary Biology
Centre, Uppsala University: Comparative analyses of
brain evolution in Lake Tanganyikan cichlid ﬁshes.
A one year (with possibility of extension to a total of
two years) post-doctoral position is hereby open within
my group at the department of Animal Ecology. The
project aims at investigating how brain structure has
evolved in relation to ecology, life histories, sexual se-
lection and speciation patterns across the highly diverse
Tanganyikan group of cichlid ﬁshes.
The project will start with collection of data on brain
structure based on analyses on wild-caught specimens
of both sexes using a combination of sectioning on a mi-
crotome and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) anal-
ysis. These analyses will be undertaken in collaboration
with Professor Svante Winberg, renowned expert on the
ﬁsh brain. This detailed data will then be compared to
an already existing data base containing information
on a number of ecological variables using formal com-
parative methods that account for phylogenetic rela-
tionships. A substantial ﬁsh lab ( >100 aquaria) is also
available for experiments investigating cognitive ability
across key species identiﬁed through the comparative
analyses. Together, these approaches aim at providing
novel insights regarding patterns of brain evolution in
vertebrates.
The successful applicant should have a PhD in evo-
lutionary biology. Experience in modern comparative
methods is considered a strong merit. Experience in
brain morphology, general ﬁsh ecology and ﬁsh dis-
section is also welcome but not essential. The salary
is 20000 SKr/month (2200 Euros) net (not subject to
Swedish income tax).
The Evolutionary Biology Centre at Uppsala Univer-
sity is one of Europe’s ﬁnest institutions in its ﬁeld and
hosts 15 departments working on the levels of genes, or-
ganisms and communities. This provides for outstand-
ing possibilities for cross-disciplinary interactions. See

Ancient DNA Training Program
A training program focused on training participants in
the analysis of degraded, diﬃcult, ancient or low copy
number DNA.
The ancient DNA training program is a three week in-
tensive course in DNA. This year we are delivering the
program from May 22nd to June 9th, 2007 at the Paleo-
DNA laboratory Lakehead University.
During the program, participants will work in small
groups (one instructor to 4 participants) and are givena project depending upon their interests. This may be
genetic analysis of museum specimens, genetic analysis
of degraded samples, disease in ancient mummiﬁed tis-
sue, genetic analysis of archived specimens or forensic
proﬁling of a remains or many other such projects. As a
participant, you will learn a variety of diﬀerent extrac-
tion methods to compare and contrast on both your
own DNA and other samples. You will generate your
own DNA proﬁle, determine your own mitochondrial
haplogroup/haplotype, your own STR proﬁle, conﬁrm
your own sex genetically and learn numerous techniques
for the analysis of DNA.
The lectures will include the history of various types
of analytical techniques, detailed mechanisms of each
method and an large array of techniques that can be
used in a genetic project. Participants will learn about
the diﬀerent types of DNA that can be analyzed: mi-
tochondrial, nuclear, chloroplast and pathogenic DNA.
You will be taught diﬀerent methods of analysis PCR-
RFLP, multiplex PCR, sequencing, regular PCR and
electrophoresis. You will learn diﬀerent methods of
sample preparation from a number of diﬀerent tissue
types like bone, teeth, hair, archived specimens, mu-
seum specimens, blood residues and mummiﬁed tissue.
You will understand the use of genetic analysis and its
potential in archaeozoology, palaeopathology, archaeol-
ogy, forensic science, palaeobotany and palaeontology.
Lectures by professors and senior analysts in the ﬁelds
of archeology, genetics, ancient DNA, forensic science,
palaeopathology and more are integrated with the lab-
oratory sessions.

antcourse/ COURSE OBJECTIVES. ? ANT
COURSE is designed for systematists, ecologists,
behaviorists, conservation biologists, and other biolo-
gists whose research responsibilities require a greater
understanding of ant taxonomy. Emphasis is on the
classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of more than ﬁfty ant
genera of North America. Lectures will include back-
ground information on the ecology, life histories and
evolution of ants. Field trips are structured to teach
collecting and sampling techniques, and associated lab
work provides instruction on specimen preparation,
sorting and labeling. Information on equipment/supply
vendors, literature, and myrmecological contacts are
also presented.
COURSE SIGNIFICANCE. ? Ant Course is a unique
opportunity to acquire training that is unavailable else-
where. This course will provide students with 1) the
conﬁdence and skills to identify the major ant genera
of North America; 2) an understanding of modern spec-
imen processing and curation techniques; 3) an appre-
ciation for the biological diversity of ants, and 4) expe-
rience keying to the species level.
SPONSORS. ? California Academy of Sciences and
Museum of Comparative Zoology, with partial funding
from the National Science Foundation.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION. ? ANT COURSE
will be taught from August 2 ? 12, 2007 at the South-
western Research Station (SWRS) in Portal Arizona (100 EvolDir March 1, 2007
http://research.amnh.org/swrs/ ). The Station is cen-
tered amid the richest ant fauna in North America.
This is an ongoing course, oﬀered annually.
PARTICIPANT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. ? ANT
COURSE is open to all interested individuals. Priority
will be given to those biologists for whom the course will
have a signiﬁcant impact on their research with ants.
An entomological background is not required. We aim
to include students with a diverse interest in biology,
including ant systematics, ecology, behavioral biology
and conservation. The high instructor to student ra-
tio will allow students to receive individual attention.
ANT COURSE is presented in English and limited to
25 participants
COSTS. ? Tuition for the 10-day COURSE is $475 for
current students and $675 for non-students. In addi-
tion, Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) fees for
this period, covering dormitory room and board, are
estimated at $460. Transportation costs between home
and Tucson (air) or SWRS (auto) are to be borne by
all participants.
FELLOWSHIPS. ? Four fellowships are available for
2007. Two fellowships cover tuition fees and two fel-
lowships cover station fees. Foreign students may apply
for additional fellowships to assist in travel. Those in-
terested in attending the course should seek all possible
avenues to secure funding for the course. You should
only apply for the Ant Course fellowship if you can not
ﬁnd other support and it is essential for your partici-
pation in the course. Beware that if you apply for an
ant course fellowship it implies that fellowship funding
is essential to your participation in the course. Thus,
if you are not selected for a fellowship, you might not
be accepted into the course. Please notify the course if

** Course announcement: Harvard University/CTFS-
AA Field Biology Course: ‘The Biodiversity of Borneo’
**
In association with the Harvard University Summer
School, the Center for Tropical Forest Science and the
Arnold Arboretum (CTFS-AA) will oﬀer a ﬁeld biol-
ogy course to be held in Sarawak and Sabah (East
Malaysia) from 23 July to 26 August 2007. Southeast
and South Asian participants will join Harvard Univer-
sity students to study terrestrial and marine biodiver-
sity, ecology and conservation, with instructors from
Harvard University and other institutions.
The forests and reefs of northwest and north Borneo
have some of the highest levels of alpha diversity in
the world. The forests are home to orang-utans, horn-
bills, rhinos and thousands of tree species, and the reefs
oﬀer some of the best diving in the world. We will
visit world-class parks and reserves (e.g., Lambir, Kin-
abalu and the Maliau Basin), to gain a thorough un-
derstanding of abiotic controls on species composition,
and will contrast processes that maintain biodiversity in
forests with those operating on coral reefs. Through-
out Borneo, intensive logging and marine harvesting
have occurred for many years. Our course will explore
the complexities of conservation today, including trips
to sustainably-managed, carbon-traded, and restored
forests. We will also provide opportunities for the stu-
dents to meet people living in and oﬀ the forest, to
understand their motivations for forest conversion and
conservation, and to consider the human health dimen-
sions of forest change.
A key feature of the course will be the development of
skills in research project design, execution and analysis,
based around the statistical platform R. The students
will complete two independent projects, from concep-
tion to presentation, and participate in a group project
on the coral reef. The students will gain database and
web publishing skills by developing a community digital
record of the trip.
The course is aimed at advanced undergraduates, re-
cent graduates currently active in biological research,
and postgraduate entry-level students. For more infor-
mation on the course (including instructions for appli-
cation) see:

Laboratory oﬀer a hands-on workshop:
Microsatellites are a powerful class of genetic markers
used in a variety of molecular studies such as determin-
ing ﬁne scale population structure, parentage, and indi-
vidual identiﬁcation. The genomes of most eukaryotes
contain thousands of loci containing short nucleotide se-
quence motifs tandemly repeated many times, such as
(CT/GA)n. The repeat units tend to be highly poly-
morphic, and several loci taken together produce a ge-
netic ﬁngerprint that is consistent and unchanging from
one individual to the next. While readily used and an-
alyzed, it is generally necessary to develop a new set
of markers for each species, as there tends to be little
crossover between species unless fairly closely related.
Developing a microsatellite library can be a long and
troublesome task, especially for those with limited
molecular background. This workshop will take par-
ticipants through the steps used to build an enriched
microsatellite library using DNA from their species of
interest using a variety of molecular techniques such re-
striction enzyme digestion, ligation, PCR, and several
screening protocols to ﬁnd loci containing polymorphic
repeat motifs. Participants will also learn about primer
design and statistical analyses.

Second Course on Molecular Evolution, Phylogenetics
and Phylogenomics
21 - 25 May 2007, Valencia. Spain
Hern´ an Dopazo, Co-ordination
The course aims to provide the necessary background
to understand the basic concepts from comparative and
evolutionary biology that are frequently used in molec-
ular biology and bioinformatics analyses. The course
consists in ﬁve full-day sessions with an adequate bal-
ance between theory and computer practice, oriented
to solve frequent problems and hypothesis testing. The
course includes a session of phylogenomic analysis and
functional annotation including the most recent devel-
opments in this area. Among other tools, attendees will
become familiar with Phylip, Phyml, PAML, TreePuz-
zle, MrBayes, Modeltest programs and tools developed
in our department such as Phylemon, FatiGO, FatiS-
can, and ETE. The course is mainly intended for profes-
sionals in the ﬁeld of biology and chemistry who work
on areas related to biological sequence analysis.
Course fee is 250 euros, a limited number of grants will
be available.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
