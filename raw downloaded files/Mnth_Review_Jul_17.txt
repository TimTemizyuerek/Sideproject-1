abstract submissions on a range of topics including Pop-
ulation Genetics, Functional Genomics, Systems and
Structural Biology, Methods for Genome-wide Associa-
tion Studies, Causal inference in genetic studies, Assem-
bly and Variant Identication, Phylogenetics, Natural
Selection and Quantitative Genetics. Alongside invited
speakers, oral presentations will be selected from sub-
mitted abstracts. We particularly encourage abstract
submissions from junior investigators, including post-
doctoral fellows and graduate students.
We have provisional capacity for only 200 participants;due to space limitations, registration will proceed on a
rst-come-rst-served basis. We already have partici-
pants from Denmark, France, Germany, US and the UK.
***IMPORTANT DEADLINE: Early bird registration
& ABSTRACT submission will close on June 23. ***
Probgen was held previously in Cold Spring Harbor

cess of previous similarly-themed workshops held at
the HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus (2013) and
Merton College, Oxford (2014).
The conference talks and poster sessions will be held
at the new Moesgaard Museum for archaeology and
ethnography (MOMU) situated just 5 km out of Aarhus.
Aarhus is most easily accessible from either Aarhus
(AAR) or Billund (BLL) Airport that serves most ma-
jor European cities.
The meeting will begin with an informal mixer on
the evening of Sunday 17 September 2017 at Hotel
Comwell [http://www.comwellaarhus.dk/] in central
Aarhus. Talks will take place from Monday 18 Septem-
ber until lunchtime on Wednesday 20 September.

Connecting Genomic Diversity to Organisms and Envi-
ronments: Gaining Insights from Advances in Technol-
ogy, Theory, and Applications
The 2017 Gordon Research Conference on Ecological and
Evolutionary Genomics will highlight recent advances
in our understanding of the genomic basis of adaptation
and the interaction between organisms and the dynamic
environments they live in. This meeting will highlight
a combination of empirical studies, recent theoretical
advances and emerging technologies. Topical areas such
as population genomics, phylogenomics, adaptation, the
genomic basis of development, and functional genomic
responses to the environment will highlight how the
rapidly advancing eld of genome biology can inform
our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological
processes that shape biodiversity. The conference will
highlight the analysis of large, complex data sets and
emerging technologies driving the expanding scale of
these data.
Co-chairs, Felicity Jones (Max Plank Institute, Tubin-
gen) and Michael Pfrender (University of Notre Dame)
along with co-Vice Chairs, Christian Landry (Univer-
sit e Laval) and Angela Douglas (Cornell University)
invite you to join us on the ocean-side campus of the
University of New England in Biddeford, Maine for a
stimulating conference. We are assembling a diverse
group of established and early career investigators to
discuss their latest work. Many sessions will include
talks by speakers chosen from among the submitted
abstracts. The organizers are actively seeking funds
to assist students and others attending the meeting.
Applications for attendance will be accepted on a rst-
come-rst serve basis until the meeting is full. Don't
delay! Gordon Conferences are famous for fostering in
depth interactions that yield new insights in a collegial
atmosphere. Please plan on joining us in Biddeford in
2017.

Symposium \Applying genomic-scale approaches to the
study of Neotropical amphibians and reptiles"
We invite you to participate in an exciting sympo-
sium addressing challenges in the application of high-
throughput sequencing technologies in amphibian and
reptiles research at the XI Latin American Congress of
Herpetology (24-28 July 2017) in Quito, Ecuador.
Genomic-scale approaches are increasing in popularity
as high-throughput sequencing techniques become more
accessible and aordable. These techniques can allow
us to investigate evolutionary and ecological questions
with a novel approaches.
Nevertheless, the use of genomic data brings many chal-
lenges across the dierent stages of a research project,
which include adequate sampling and preservation meth-
ods during eldwork, museum curation, data processing,
and bioinformatic analyses.
The symposium will include work on phylogenetics, en-
vironmental DNA, physiology, metagenomics, micro-
biomes, disease research, and gene expression applied
to amphibians and reptiles.
Submission deadline for abstracts: 8 June 2017.

Connecting Genomic Diversity to Organisms and Envi-
ronments: Gaining Insights from Advances in Technol-
ogy, Theory, and Applications
The 2017 Gordon Research Conference on Ecological and
Evolutionary Genomics will highlight recent advances
in our understanding of the genomic basis of adaptation
and the interaction between organisms and the dynamic
environments they live in. This meeting will highlight
a combination of empirical studies, recent theoretical
advances and emerging technologies. Topical areas such
as population genomics, phylogenomics, adaptation, the
genomic basis of development, and functional genomic
responses to the environment will highlight how the
rapidly advancing eld of genome biology can inform
our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological
processes that shape biodiversity. The conference will
highlight the analysis of large, complex data sets and
emerging technologies driving the expanding scale of
these data.
Co-chairs, Felicity Jones (Max Plank Institute, Tubin-
gen) and Michael Pfrender (University of Notre Dame)
along with co-Vice Chairs, Christian Landry (Univer-
site Laval) and Angela Douglas (Cornell University)

BangorU PollenBiodiversity
Exploring the ecology of airborne pollen biodiversity
using environmental DA analysis and identifying links
to hay fever
We are advertising for a PhD opportunity to be
hosted in the Molecular Ecology & Fisheries Genetics
Laboratory (MEFGL), at Bangor University (http:/-
/mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/) to commence in October 2017.
The PhD has been made possible via the availabil-
ity of the ERC Industrial Strategy CASE Studentship
scheme and strong links with project partner, the
ational Botanic Garden of Wales. The studentship will
form part of the ERC EVISIO Doctoral Training Pro-
gramme (http://www.envision-dtp.org/), a PhD con-
sortium partnership between Bangor, ottingham and
Lancaster Universities, alongside numerous environmen-
tal bodies, aimed at equipping the next generation of
Environmental Biologists with advanced skills.
Project rationale: In addition to providing benets
to society, biodiversity^ a ealso brings costs. The aerial
biosphere includes ecologically complex^ a emixtures of
pollens that negatively aect human health. Almost a
quarter^ a eof people display allergic reactions to tree
and grass pollen, causing^ a esymptoms ranging from
hay fever to asthma, with associated socio-^ a eeconomic
costs. Identifying tree pollens can be achieved us-ing microscopy,^ a ebut the process is challenging. ev-
ertheless, since most grass pollens look^ a ethe same, we
need to devise novel ways to identify dierent species
to^ aeunderstand which species of grass contribute to al-
lergies. This studentship^ a ehas three components. The
rst aims to use an environmental DA (eDA) approach
to enhance the way that we assess aerial tree pollen
mixtures. Secondly, to use modelling approaches to
compare and contrast the aerial transit of tree and grass
pollens in relation to biology/ecology and nally, to
identify which species of grass pollen are linked with
hay fever. The PhD will form a distinct component
within a larger ERC funded study \PollerGE" (http://-
pollergen.bangor.ac.uk/) and provide an opportunity
to work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists
from a range of UK Universities, the UK Met Of-
ce and the CASE Partner, ational Botanic Garden
of Wales (BGW - home of the Wales Plant DA Bar-
code library). The successful candidate will become
a highly skilled, interdisciplinary graduate working at
the interface between molecular ecology and environ-
mental epidemiology with the potential to make sub-
stantial advances to our understanding of UK ora pol-
lination dynamics and interactions with the allergic
response. Co-supervision will be provided by atasha De-
Vere/Gareth Grith/Mat Hegarty (BGW and Aberyst-
wyth), Carsten Skjth (Worcester), Ben Wheeler/ick Os-
borne (Exeter/Sydney) and the UK Met Oce. Training
will be provided in the main areas of molecular ecology,
genomics, taxonomy, bioinformatics, modelling; mul-
tidisciplinarity skills and epidemiology, complemented
by a host of additional opportunities for postgraduateJuly 1, 2017 EvolDir 13
development. Fieldwork will occur within the UK, with
opportunities for travel/collaborations in Europe and
Australia.
Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Honours De-
gree at 2:1 level or equivalent in subjects such as Biology,
Environmental or atural Sciences, with a strong motiva-
tion to study eDA biodiversity- environment interactions.
Eligibility requirements and application portal can be
found at http://www.envision-dtp.org . If you are inter-
ested in applying, we would strongly recommend con-
tacting Prof. Simon Creer in the rst instance (http://-
mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/sta/si.php; s.creer@bangor.ac.uk;
Twitter @spideycreer) and he will be on hand to assist
with any questions related to the project, important
information on the application process and life in the
group.
Closing date for applications: 2nd of July 2017 with
interviews predicted to take place between 13th-14th
July and look forward to hearing from you!

ImmuneDefenseEvolution
A PhD student position is oered in the group of aquatic
ecology at ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology Zurich) / Eawag (Swiss Federal Institute of
Aquatic Research), in Switzerland, to assess evolution-
ary potential of innate immune traits of the freshwater
snail Lymnaea stagnalis.
Host immune capabilities that counter harmful para-
sites are considered important determinants for tness.
However, knowledge on the evolutionary potential of
immune traits in the wild is limited. This project will
examine the extent of genetic variation as well as ge-
netic architecture of snail immunity in natural popula-
tions under stress of parasite infections. The project
will combine eld work, classical quantitative genetic
breeding designs, and modern genomics and transcrip-
tomics technologies. The goals of the project are (1)
to quantify additive genetic variance and covariance
of immune defense traits under eld conditions, (2) to
determine their genetic architecture by testing whether
the traits are polygenic or not and which candidate
loci contribute to trait variation, and (3) to test the
relative importance of various genetic and non-genetic
factors in determining the expression of immune genes
by calculating variance components for them. Exten-
sive transcriptomic datasets, previously obtained from
L. stagnalis, are available to initiate this project. The
work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Phi-
line Feulner (Eawag), Prof. Coen Adema (University of
New Mexico) and the Genetic Diversity Centre at ETH
(http://www.gdc.ethz.ch/).
General information about the research group can be
found at http://www.ae.ethz.ch/ We invite highly moti-
vated students with a good background in evolutionary
ecology and molecular methods to apply for the posi-
tion. A MSc or equivalent degree is required. Earlier
experience with the study system is not required. The
project is funded by ETH Zurich for 3 years. The project
will be integrated with ongoing investigations of natural
selection on immune function.
Earliest starting date: September 1, 2017
Qualied persons are invited to apply by email. Please
attach a single PDF le including a letter of motiva-
tion, CV, and names plus contact information of two

EvolutionaryGenomics
The Gareld Lab for Evolutionary Biology at the IRI
for Life Sciences/Humboldt University of Berlin has an
opening for a PhD student in the eld of evolutionary
genomics/developmental biology.
Our group focuses on understanding the evolution of
developmental gene expression from a population ge-
netics perspective. We are currently recruiting for a
project aimed at understanding how gene regulatory
networks evolve between closely related species of sea
urchin using a combination of 'omics' methods, includ-
ing single-cell sequencing, and computational analyses
of DNA sequence evolution. The position oers train-
ing primarily in experimental biology, though students
interested in computational and analytical methods are
also encouraged to apply.
PhD candidates will have a Masters degree in Molecular
Biology, Evolution, Genetics, or a related eld and an
interest in understanding evolutionary processes as well
as the molecular mechanisms underlying development.
Previous experience with modern genomics methods
(e.g. high-throughput sequencing) is encouraged but
not required. Strong communication and organisational
skills are a must. Recruitment is through the IRI Gradu-
ate School, which oers numerous training opportunities
as well as close interactions with our partner institutions
(Charit e and the Max Delbr uck Center for Molecular
Medicine) and collaborators at the nearby Museum of
Natural History.
We oer a competitive salary according to German E13
TV oD/Bund (65%). Contracts are 3 years in duration
with the possibility of extension. While the working
language of the laboratory is English, some knowledge
of German (or a willingness to learn) is encouraged. The

INRA Avignon AphidAdaptation
PhD thesis proposal : Non host resistance and ge-
netic/heritable resistance: how Aphis gossypii, the
melon aphid, does adapt?
Supervisor Nathalie Boissot INRA-GAFL (Avi-
gnon, https://www6.paca.inra.fr/ga eng/),
Nathalie.Boissot@inra.fr for more details
The paradigm for plant-pathogen interactions is based
on the evolution of molecular patterns of pathogens
recognized by the plant (1)): pathogens adapt to im-
mune reaction of plants, either the immune reaction
concern the entire plant species and act against the
pathogen at the scale species, it is non host resistance,
or the immune reaction concern specic plant accessions,
what we call genetic resistance or heritable resistance.
Like pathogens, aphids deliver into the plant eectors
via their adapted mouthparts, the stylets. Aphids es-
tablish a compatible relationship with the plant when
these stylets reach the phloem in which they feed. Does
the paradigm for plants/pathogens coevolution portable
to plants/aphids interaction as proposed recently (2),
especially in the Melon-Aphis gossypii system? An alter-
nate hypothesis is that aphid specializing on Cucurbit
and/or adapted to NLR resistance present in melon use
the particularity of the phloemic system, which is dual,
in Cucurbits (3).

WORKPACKAGES 1A / Establish in which phloem of
Cucurbitaceous plants feed in A. gossypii clones special-
izing on Cucurbits. This could be tested on Cucurbits
belonging to three genera of Cucurbitaceaous: Cucumis
melo, Cucurbita pepo and Citrullus lanatus.1B / Determine whether the punctures of non-Cucurbits
aphids not-specializing on Cucurbits cause clogging of
the fascicular and/or extra-fascicular phloem on a non-
Vat melon plant.
1C / Determine whether the punctures of the specializ-
ing clones on Cucurbits which elicit the Vat resistance
(ie avirulent clone) lead to clogging of the fascicular
phloem and/or extra fascicular on melon Vat plants.
2A / Characterize the diversity of candidate genes for
their involvement in the adaptation of A. gossypii to
Cucurbits. Establish the phylogeny and confront it with
the membership of the breed of hosts of the individuals
analyzed. Seek for the traces of selection in these genes.
2B / Identify the avirulence gene in A. gossypii eliciting
the Vat resistance. Characterize its diversity, establish
the frequency of the allele (s) conferring virulence in
natural populations.
METHODOLOGY PROPOSITIONS To determine in
which phloem feed the aphids specializing on Cucur-
bits, adapted or not to the Vat-1 resistance, we will
collaborate with the team of Sylvie Dinant at the IJPB
(http://www-ijpb.versailles.inra.fr/en/). We will take
advantage of the dierence in ow velocity in the two
types of phloem in Cucurbits, coupled with the use of
uorochromes (Zhang et al., 2010) that can be tracked
even in honeydew produced by aphids.
We will use the particular phenotype of aphid-elicited
resistance to viruses to identify among an established set
of candidate proteins the aphid eector for avirulence.
Candidate proteins will be expressed in planta via the
use of a viral expression vector. If the candidate protein
is the elicitor of resistance, replication of the virus will
be blocked in Vat-1 melons but will occur in non-Vat-1
melons. This work will be carried out in collabora-
tion with C ecile Desbiez, (http://www6.paca.inra.fr/-
pathologie vegetale eng/).
We will sample on Cucurbits winged individuals at
spring, these aphid populations are known to contain
wide diversity (Thomas et al., 2012). Each individual
will be characterized on the basis of the 8 SSR markers
used routinely in the laboratory and assigned to one of
the genetic groups established on the basis of the 2095
genotypes that we have described to date. The candi-
date genes studied will be sequenced in individuals with
non-redundant multilocus genotypes, we will establish
phylogenies and selective traces of selection. This work
will be carried out in collaboration with Flavie Vanler-
berghe, (http://www6.montpellier.inra.fr/cbgp eng/).

PopulationGenomicsEuropeanBeech
European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is a keystone tree
species in European forests, making up 14-18% of total
forest cover and with a range spanning from Greece to
Sweden.
Beech is the focus of multiple, long-lasting and intensive
international research programs in ecology and popu-
lation genetics. Despite this, little is known about the
genetic bases of the adaptation of this species to environ-
mental variation, no genomic reference is available and
patterns of genomic diversity are virtually unexplored.
Based on genome sequencing and re-sequencing data,
obtained on natural populations and provenance tests
throughout Europe, we propose to study patterns of
adaptive diversity in coding and promoter regions, to:
(a) determine patterns of genomic diversity determined
by adaptive processes at multiple geographical scales,
from stand to region to range; (b) estimate intensity
of selection, through a combination of analytical and
modelling approaches; (c) model and predict the ability
of European beech to cope with climate change through
adaptation.

- predispositions to manage large experiments, animal
stocks, execute histological and microscopic procedures,

Short project outline
1) The main question to be addressed in the project
What is an evolutionary signicance cell size dierences
and how an adaptive value of cell size varies with envi-
ronmental conditions?
2) Background information Following the theory of op-
timal cell size, a body that consists of many small cells
gains increased capacity to deliver oxygen and fuel to
cells, but small cells are also costly due to the need
to spend energy on their maintenance. We predict
that small cells help ectotherms in warm, food-rich but
oxygen-poor environments, but they harm ectotherms
in cold, food-poor and oxygen-rich environments. A
warm ectotherm has speeded metabolism that requires
oxygen and fuel, and small cells should help to meet
these challenges. In cold and oxygen-rich environment,
where organisms do not need super-fast cellular trans-
port but should save energy, large and economic cells
would be advantageous.
3) Description of work Laboratory experiments on
Drosophila melanogaster will explore how cell size dif-
ferences between dierent lines of ies correspond to or-
ganismal performance during activity (ight endurance
and intensity, egg laying) and during rest (oxygen con-
sumption) at dierent thermal and oxygen conditions.
Generally, by raising ambient temperature, we will test
whether small cells help ies to perform in warm and
low-oxygen conditions. We will use lines with muta-
tions in cell cycle generated by genetic engineering, lines
with evolved cell size dierences during evolutionary
experiment, and lines with plastic changes in cell size.
Histological methods with automated methods of image
analysis will be used to measure cell size dierences
among ies. Confocal microscopy will be used to mea-
sure dierences in the architecture of a tracheal system.

ButterySpeciation
PhD: Behavioural isolation in Heliconius butteries
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to in-
vestigate mate choice and speciation in the tropics. The
student will focus on behavioural and genetic/genomic
aspects of reproductive isolation in Heliconius butter-
ies.
The student will be supervised by Dr Richard Merrill
(https://richmerrill.wordpress.com), and funded as part
of his DFG Emmy Noether grant. The project is focused
on understanding the genetic basis and evolution of dif-
ferences in visual mate recognition between divergent
Heliconius taxa. Heliconius butteries are well known
for their bright warning patterns, which males also use
as a mate recognition cue. Although the genetic basis
of the colour pattern cues is now known in great detail,
we know relatively little about the genetic basis of the
corresponding preference behaviours. In addition, we
still know little of how colour pattern cues may inuence
female mating decisions.
The project would suit someone keen to combine eld-
work and behavioural experiments in the tropics with
molecular lab work and genomic analysis.
Methodological approaches could include mate choice
assays, QTL and/or gene expression analyses, but could
also involve additional eld, lab or insectary experiments
depending on the candidate's interests.
The successful candidate will be based in the Division of
Evolutionary Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat,
Munich. Across the division, we take an integrative
approach to the study of evolutionary processes (http:/-
/www.evol.bio.lmu.de/), and apply a large range of
methodologies including eldwork, population genetic
modelling, large genomic approaches, experimental evo-
lution work and functional characterization. The stu-
dent will also likely spend considerable time at the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, in
collaboration with Dr Owen McMillan's research group.
Both at LMU and STRI (http://www.stri.si.edu), the
student will be part of vibrant international communi-
ties of scientists. The researcher will join a collaborative
and driven community of Heliconius biologists (http://-
www.heliconius.org).

MaxPlanck BeetleMolEvol
The MPI for Chemical Ecology, Department of Ento-
mology, has an opening for a PhD student (m/f) on a
DFG-funded project
Project Description: The charismatic longhorned bee-
tles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) are part of the most
diverse group of wood-feeding (xylophagous) animals
on Earth. Larvae of these beetles have evolved to thrive
on a highly challenging and sub-optimal environment -
wood material - where they have to cope with the struc-
tural polysaccharides of the plant cell wall which make
the bulk of their food. Earlier research indicated that
cerambycid beetle larvae break down cellulose, hemi-
celluloses and pectins themselves by producing plant
cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), independent
of symbionts. Yet, the corresponding genes and the way
they evolved remain elusive in this group of beetles. By
combining gene discovery by sequencing beetle midgut
transcriptome using RNA-Seq, to phylogenetic analyses
and rapid screening of enzymatic activity by expressing
the corresponding cDNAs in heterologous expression
systems, this project aims to identify and characterize
the genes encoding PCWDEs and to determine their
evolutionary history in Cerambycidae. This research
will provide information on how host plants and feeding
behavior have shaped the composition of these gene
families during the evolution of Cerambycidae; and on
how PCWDEs contributed to build and maintain the
biodiversity of this family of beetles. This project also
opens the exciting possibility that screening the gut
transcriptome of longhorned beetles represents an alter-native to microorganisms for the discovery of new and
better PCWDEs for use in industrial biotechnology, in
particular for the improvement of biofuel production
from plant biomass.
We are looking for a motivated student with a Uni-
versity degree (M.Sc. or equivalent) with a focus on
bioinformatics and molecular evolution, with a strong
will to work in the wet lab. We expect good verbal and
written communication skills. Experience working with
RNA-Seq data (assembly and analysis) and molecular
evolution methodologies (phylogenetic analyses among
others^ a euro ^A) is required. Knowledge of dierent
wet lab techniques (e.g. PCR; DNA, RNA and protein
extraction; Western Blot; Enzyme assays; insect cell
and/or bacterial cultures) is a plus.
We oer excellent technical equipment and close super-
vision in an international environment. A structured
PhD program is oered by our graduate school (IMPRS)
which provides interdisciplinary training by seminars,
lectures and scientic workshops. The payment and
benets are based on the TVoD guidelines and the ap-
pointment is for 3 years with possibility of extension.

Rothamsted AphidGenetics
A full Waitrose - BBSRC CTP funded PhD position is
open to work on population genetics and the evolution
of resistance in aphids. The project is a collaboration
between Rothamsted Research, University of Warwick,
and G's, a leading lettuce producer.
\Using landscape genomics to improve management of
insect pest species"
Insect pests have a widespread negative impact in agri-
culture, resulting in very large economic loses. Moni-
toring and surveillance of pest species is fundamental
to control their populations and reduce the damage
they inict on crops. This is because an early detection
improves the chances of controlling them before they
spread out and increase their population size. However,
studying the migration of small insects can be prob-
lematic due to the diculty of tracking individuals. In
addition, resistance to pest control methods, whether
to insecticide or to host-plant resistant cultivars, is be-
coming an increasingly important issue. Inferring the
population structure of pest species and the connectivity
across populations and landscapes is key to understandmigration patterns, which can be used to inform pest
surveillance and control schemes. This fully-funded
project provides an exciting opportunity to apply popu-
lation genomics and evolutionary concepts to improve
insect pest management and understand the evolution
of resistance.
The project will use /Nasonovia ribisnigri/, the currant-
lettuce aphid, as a model system to evaluate how land-
scape genomics can be used to improve aphid surveil-
lance and control the spread of resistance alleles. The
currant-lettuce aphid, /Nasonovia ribisnigri/, is a ma-
jor pest of lettuce crops responsible for large economic
losses. One of the most ecient way to reduce aphid
infestations and damage is growing host-resistant let-
tuce cultivars that stop aphids from colonising the plant.
However, the capacity of breaking the host-plant re-
sistance mechanism (Rb) has recently evolved in some
biotypes. In these circumstances, surveillance and mon-
itoring of crops becomes of great importance to produce
early warning information that would improve targeted
control of /N. ribisnigri /before aphids enter the lettuce
head. However, the paradox is that whilst winged aphids
are quick to colonise the lettuce crop in spring they are
unusually scarce in both water traps and suction traps.
Understanding the migration patterns of the species
is, therefore, fundamental to design ecient methods
of capture and control. For this, the project will use
genomics to infer the population structure and the lev-
els of gene ow between populations of /N. ribisnigri/
at dierent geographic scales and dierent landscapes.
This knowledge will be used to develop surveillance
methods that maximise the observation of individuals
of the species at the early stages of their migration into
the crops. Furthermore, these results combined with
the development of genome-wide markers for the Rb
phenotype will provide fundamental information about
the evolution and spread of resistance across the UK.

I have funding for a UK/EU PhD student to start on
October 2nd.
This is a bioinformatics project of data analysis as op-
posed to 'wet-lab'. The area is disease genomics with a
focus on schizophrenia.
Next generation sequencing enables us to detect nearly22 EvolDir July 1, 2017
all the genetic variants in an individual. The diculty
for determining the cause of disease is that there are
hundreds of thousands of variants per person. A GWAS
of nearly 37,000 patients and over 100,000 controls asso-
ciated 108 loci with schizophrenia but these only explain
3% of the disease risk. There are clearly more variants
to be found. The aim of the project is to develop and
apply a dierent approach to work with moderate-sized
patient groups. The idea is rstly to lter the variants
in one patient by combining biological knowledge and
pathogenicity predictions from databases to a shortlist
that are likely to be contributing to disease. Using gene
expression data to dene dierential expression in the
brain will particularly be investigated. Secondly, to
look for a common process from the aggregated variants
across a set of patients, with the assumption that each
may have a dierent variant.
Schizophrenia has a lifetime prevalence of 0.5-1% and it
is ranked as the 12th highest worldwide cause of disabil-
ity. It is a chronic condition that can impact on your
ability to think, your emotions and behaviour. People
with schizophrenia are often unable to connect and prop-
erly function in the society around them. Identifying
genetic variants and the process involved in schizophre-
nia should lead to people being diagnosed quicker and
more targeted treatments, which would improve patient
prognosis and wellbeing. The developed method should
be of broad interest for identifying variants in other
diseases and relevant to interpreting results from the
NHS 100,000 genomes project.
You will work with variant calls from existing exome
sequences and publically available gene expression data.
You will need to use a Linux server and programme in a
language such as Perl. These are skills I can teach you,
but it is essential that you have a logical mind and are
good at solving novel problems. You should consider
this position if you are good at maths or statistics. I
particularly encourage you to apply if you have expe-
rience in large-scale data analysis or programming in
a language such as Perl. You should have at least a
2.1 Honours degree in either a biological subject with
a maths or statistics component, physics, or computer
science.
You would be a part of the Sheeld Bioinformatics Hub,
which includes several researchers from the University
of Sheeld and their PhD students. The Hub provides
support, opportunities for seminars and discussion and
to learn from other members. Sheeld is a lovely city,
there are plenty of green spaces and the Peak District is
nearby. Living costs are reasonable and many students
like the city so much that they stay on here.

PhD position in biology, Institute of Life and Environ-
mental Sciences, University of Iceland
A full PhD position in biology is open for applications,
at the Institute of Life and Environmental Sciences
for the project: Evolution of reproductive barriers
in sympatric Arctic charr morphs: http://luvs.hi.is/-
phdposition evolution reproductive barriers sympatric arctic charr morphs
How is phenotypic integrity maintained in the face
of gene ow? What is the eect of hybridization on
development and tness? What are the molecular
mechanisms behind hybrid incompatibilities? These
and related questions will be addressed by a team of
researchers, and a capable PhD student responding to
this advertisement.
The project The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) of
Lake Thingvallavatn is ideally suited to address these
questions. The Lake was formed at the end of the last
glacial epoch just 11-10 thousand years ago and despite
its young age it now harbors four morphs of Arctic
charr, whose distinct variation in life history character-
istics, behavior and trophic morphology suggest rapid
adaptive diversication, possibly followed by or caus-
ing build-up of reproductive barriers. The focus of
this project will be on the two smaller Thingvallavatn
morphs, planktivorous- (PL) and small benthic-charr
(SB), which have diverged along the limnetic - benthic
ecological axis, and inhabit dierent parts of the lake.
Breeding populations of both morphs are large and their
spawning overlaps spatially and temporally seemingly
presenting ample opportunities for cross-mating. Yet,
population genetic studies show that they constitute
distinct populations, which suggests eective reproduc-
tive barrier(s). We intend to cast light on the nature of
these barriers. The central hypothesis underlying our
investigation is that reproductive isolation between SB
and PL Arctic charr is partly due to strong negative
selection against hybrid ospring and/or dierences in
the exact timing of spawning (i.e. time of the day),
precise spawning location and/or mating behavior. The
Ph.D. project's aims are to: i) Assess hybrid survival
and tness during embryonic and early larval develop-
ment ii) Study gene expression during development of
hybrid and pure morph crosses iii) Study the spawning
behavior of the two morphs and their interaction in the
wild and in the lab.The applicant must have completed an M.Sc. degree in
Biology or related elds from a University approved by
the University of Iceland's|Graduate School. Those
with an advanced degree including at least a 60 ECTS
credits thesis project will be given precedence. Diving
experience is a plus.
We are seeking a student with dedication, drive and
good theoretical background in evolution, developmen-
tal and molecular biology and an interest in animal
behavior. The work involves planning and executing
sampling in the eld, acquisition and analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data and numerical analyses,
designing laboratory experiments. The position will
be at the University of Iceland and the work will take
place there. Experts at the University of Aberdeen,
Scotland and the H olar University College, Iceland, will
also participate in the project.
Application deadline is July 15th 2017. The PhD study
should be completed within four years of full time study.
The PhD student may be involved in teaching, for two
semesters maximum. The selected candidate will have
to formally apply for PhD studies at the University of
Iceland in due time.
Applicants should send a letter of intent (maximum two
pages) explaining interest in working on this project, the
reason to pursue a PhD, hopes to gain and learn during
the PhD studies and what makes them suitable for this
project to Sigurdur S. Snorrason (sigsnor@hi.is). They
should also send a i) CV, ii) transcripts of university
diplomas, iii) courses taken at bachelor and masters
level, iv) degree project thesis and v) names and contact
information of two persons that could provide letters of
references.
The student will join the Arctic charr group at the In-
stitute of Life and Environmental Sciences, under the
supervision of Sigurdur S. Snorrason, Arnar Palsson
and Zophonias O. Jonsson. The Arctic charr group
consists of several PhD students and senior personnel,
and has collaborators in Iceland, Denmark, Scotland
and Canada. The combined expertise covers population
ecology and genetics, molecular biology and bioinformat-
ics. At the institute we have well equipped molecular
biology labs, and instruments and computer pipelines
for high throughput sequencing, are accessible there or
at collaborating centers.

\Phylogeny and Molecular Evolution" (http:/-
/www.isem.univ-montp2.fr/recherche/equipes/-
phylogenie-et-evolution-moleculaire/personnel/).
Background. Despite its widespread occurrence across
the tree of life, many questions still remain unanswered
concerning the fascinating phenomenon of convergent
evolution. Our objectives with this project are to pro-
vide new insights on a textbook example of adaptive
evolutionary convergence represented by mammalian
myrmecophagous species, in which similar phenotypes
evolved independently in several lineages. The acquisi-
tion of a myrmecophagous diet almost exclusively com-
posed of ants and/or termites has indeed evolved in-
dependently in ve placental lineages with armadillos
(Cingulata), anteaters (Pilosa), aardvarks (Tubuliden-
tata), pangolins (Pholidota) and aardwolves (Carnivora).
However, large-scale comparative genomic studies of
myrmecophagous placentals are still lacking. In this
ConvergeAnt PhD project, we propose taking advan-
tage of the unique set of convergently evolved characters
associated with the ant-eating diet to investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypical adap-
tation by analyzing the genomes of myrmecophagous
placentals.
Tasks. The main objectives of this PhD project are to re-
veal the genomic adaptations underlying the convergent
evolution of myrmecophagous phenotypes in armadil-
los, anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, and aardwolves.The fundamental evolutionary questions we aim to an-
swer by the completion of this project are: (1) Which
genomic adaptations have evolved in response to the
selective constraints imposed by the myrmecophagous
life-style? (2) Do the same genomic adaptations un-
derlie the convergent phenotypes seen in independent
ant-eating mammalian lineages? (3) How widespread is
adaptive convergent molecular evolution in ant-eating
placental genomes? To this aim we will analyse genomic
data that are currently produced within the project
in the form of both RNAseq experiments and whole
genome sequences. We will rst focus on candidate genes
likely to be involved in the convergent adaptation to the
myrmecophagous diet. For these genes, we will perform
detailed analyses of molecular evolution based on site-
and branch-wise estimations of the non-synonymous to
synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS) in order to in-
vestigate the potential occurrence of convergent selective
pressures in myrmecophagous lineages. We will then
evaluate the extent of genome-wide adaptive convergent
molecular evolution in myrmecophages by performing
genome-wide survey of convergent and divergent amino
acid substitutions using site-heterogeneous mixture mod-
els. The aim is to identify genes presenting an excess of
adaptive convergent substitutions in myrmecophagous
lineages by contrast with non myrmecophagous lineages.
Finally, we will investigate the potential parallel evo-
lution of specic gene families such as olfactory and
taste receptors. Gene repertoires will be statistically
compared among myrmecophagous species to identify
potential convergent expansions and/or losses relative
to other mammalian species with dierent diets. Over-
all, the project will build upon recent experimental and
theoretical advances on detecting convergent evolution
at the molecular level.
Candidate prole. Mandatory requirements include a
Master's degree in evolutionary biology, bioinformatics
skills, experience in working with genomic data (whole
genome assembly, RNAseq), and good knowledge of
phylogenetics and molecular evolution methods. Basic
programming skills (Bash/Perl/Python scripting) are a
prerequisite, advanced programming skills will be a plus.
A high degree of initiative and motivation, and dedi-
cation to the project are also expected. There are no
conditions of nationality, but as the successful candidate
will be part of an international team, good English skills
and capacity for teamwork are highly desirable. The suc-
cessful candidate will have a genuine interest to interact
with other project members working on morphological
evolution and microbiome evolution in mammals.
Applications. Candidates must send electronically their
application before June 30th, 2017 in the form of a single

A PhD position: Climate Change: phylogenetic compar-

elling UNSW has announced another round of presti-
gious PhD scholarship (http://www.2025.unsw.edu.au/-
apply). We have been lucky enough to have been
awarded one of these.
This project comes with $40,000 per year stipend and
$10,000 of research funding per year (for full 4 years). It
is open to both Australian and international applicants.
The topic is broad intentionally to attract an outstand-
ing student: Climate change is impacting ecosystems
worldwide. Many plant and animal species will not sur-
vive unless their distributions shift. However, not all
species are moving and we don't systematically under-
stand why.
This is a key challenge for understanding climate impact.
In this project students will tackle important knowledge
gaps: Can we use functional traits to predict species'
ability to shift distributions? Which biotic and abiotic
factors are important in determining species range? Do
dierent processes act at northern vs southern limits?26 EvolDir July 1, 2017
And, are distributions shaped by extreme climate events,
or by the average conditions at a site? We will tackle
a range of questions relating to climate change using
phylogenetic comparative methods, meta-analysis and
computational modelling (our supervisor team members
are experts in these areas).
Given the generous stipend and project funding, an
applicant is expected to be very competitive. We expect
an applicant to have at least one peer-reviewed publica-
tion or an equivalent publication or experience which
demonstrate their outstanding abilities.

Evaluating marine biodiversity in New Zealand using
environmental DNA
A PhD position studying marine biodiversity in New
Zealand is available with Dr Michael Knapp at the Uni-
versity of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.
A key to ecient, ecosystem-based management of ma-
rine resources is the availability of suitable tools to
measure patterns in biodiversity. Current methods are
costly, labour intensive and rely on surveys of a lim-
ited number of indicator species and sites to provide
an estimate of biodiversity and ecosystem health. Con-
sequently, their capacity for resolving the complexity
of marine communities at an ecosystem level is highly
compromised.
This PhD project will establish, test and apply an in-
novative, high-throughput and cost ecient strategy
for quantifying marine biodiversity using environmental
DNA (eDNA) extracted from marine water samples. It
will include evaluating and analysing the biodiversity
in marine protected areas around New Zealand and its
implications for marine conservation eorts.

We are pleased to announce that our university (Univer-
sity Pau & Pays Adour, Anglet, France) invites candi-
dates to apply for PhD grants. Our lab (Research Unit
Behavioral Ecology and Fish Population Biology, INRA)
should be given a PhD position depending on applying
candidates and we therefore seek outstanding candidate
interested in ecology and evolution of invasive sh in
sub Antarctic Islands. Research topics are exible, but
would fall within current lab interests, with specic con-
sideration for long-term evolution of anadromy in the
introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) and its impact on
invasion dynamics in Kerguelen Island. In addition toanalyzing sclerochronological structures (i.e. sh scales
and otolith) from our historical collection (back to the
1970'), the PhD students will interpret movement pat-
tern based on LA-ICPMS microchemical/isotopic data
and could develop demographic modeling. Candidates
should display a strong motivation for both practical
and theoretical biology, with interest in methodological
development. In this context, skills in modelling and
coding are desirable, although candidate will be trained
during its PhD.
The PhD position will be supported through the
E2S^ aconsortium (

Applications are invited for a motivated PhD candidate
to join a NERC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training
(CDT), the Quantitative and Modelling Skills in Ecol-
ogy and Evolution CDT. A project on medicinal plant
barcoding is one of 16 projects currently advertised by
this CDT - ultimately ve of these 16 will be funded to
start in October 2017.
The project is co-supervised by Dr Caroline Howard
of the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory30 EvolDir July 1, 2017
Agency (MHRA) and Professor Julie Hawkins (Univer-
sity of Reading). The Medicine and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is leading internationally
in devising more eective processes for regulation of
herbal medicines: the British Pharmacopeia (BP) was
the rst to include DNA barcode markers for commer-
cial users. This project will focus on Drimia (squill).
Squill has a long history of medicinal use and is included
in commercial herbal medicines. Correct identication
and quantication of species present in commerce is
important, since Drimia is toxic in large amounts and
toxicity may vary between species and varieties.
Any questions about the CDT, please con-
tact Ibi Wallbank, Departmental Manager, at

We are searching for motivated students who would
like to do their master thesis on Lake Tanganyika ci-
chlids. In our current project we aim to investigate
the ecological, developmental and endocrinological pa-
rameters that might permit the expression of coopera-
tive behaviour in a non-cooperative species, using two
closely related species: Neolamprologus pulcher (Coop-
erative breeder) and Neolamprologus caudopunctatus
(Biparental breeder).
Master thesis could address several questions:
1) Developmental acquisition of social competence
2) Endocrinological manipulation of cooperative be-
haviour
3) Ecological enhancers of cooperative behaviour
We are looking forward to hosting master students who
are interested in scientic questions and sh biology
and are able to work independently as well as within a
team. Our daily communication is mainly in English;
good English skills are therefore desired. Our institute,

More details:
Kew is the world's leading botanic gardens, at the fore-
front of plant and fungal science, a UNESCO World
Heritage Site and a major visitor attraction. We want
a world where plants and fungi are understood, valued
and conserved - because our lives depend on them. We
use the power of our science and the rich diversity of
our gardens and collections to provide knowledge, in-
spiration and understanding of why plants and fungi
matter to everyone.
The project: There are few grander challenges in science
than the tree of life - uncovering the complete evolution-
ary history linking all life on Earth. As part of RBG
Kew's Science Strategy 2015-2020, we have initiated a
ve-year multimillion-pound initiative, the Plant and
Fungal Trees of Life project (or PAFTOL, for short),
to complete the tree of life for all genera of plants and
fungi, drawing on our outstanding collections, our broad
collaborative networks and the latest high-throughput
DNA sequencing technologies.
This ambitious project will create a unifying framework
for comparative plant and fungal research and takes us
a step closer to the ultimate goal of building the tree
of life for all known species. We will generate high im-
pact ndings publishable in top science journals, but we
want the results to reach beyond the science community.
To achieve this we will build innovative big-data and
visualization tools accessible to a scientist or a school
child. PAFTOL has secured generous funding from the
Calleva and Sackler Foundations, and the work is now
underway. This is a truly exciting time to join Kew and
become an integral part of a high-prole, cutting edge
global endeavour.
The team: At Kew, you'll be joining a truly multidisci-
plinary team comprising experts from across a range of
scientic elds. Having recently recruited into research
and technical positions, we are now seeking critical
capacity in project management, to ensure that the
project is delivered eciently and eectively. You'll
work alongside a highly supportive team of Kew sta,
including senior scientists, who have actively developed36 EvolDir July 1, 2017
the PAFTOL concept.
The role: This role is critical to the successful delivery
of the project. You will be responsible for the overall
co-ordination of the project and its team, and the wider
dissemination of the project's results within the scien-
tic community and the general public. You will be
an active member of a high-prole, multi-disciplinary
team led by the Head of Comparative Plant and Fungal
Biology, with responsibility for all aspects of project
management and nance, as well as engagement and
communications across a wide range of stakeholders.
You: You could be an experienced project manager with
a passion for science, or a scientist pursuing an career in
science co-ordination and communications. Whatever
your background, you'll have an agile mind, a clear and
positive approach to problem-solving, and an appetite
for working with people to get fantastic results.

ComputationEvolutionaryVirology
The Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virol-
ogy (Rega Institute - KU Leuven, Belgium; https://-
rega.kuleuven.be/cev/ecv/) is looking for a motivated
PhD student to perform research in a multidisciplinary
team. This constitutes an exciting opportunity to work
on computational and statistical methods in molecular
evolution with applications in infectious diseases.
Research groupThe Evolutionary and Computational Virology Labo-
ratory at the Division of Clinical and Epidemiological
Virology (Rega Institute, KU Leuven) focuses on the
evolutionary processes that shape viral genetic diversity.
This encompasses large-scale epidemic processes, such
as population growth and spatial dispersal (a popular
topic in phylogeographic and phylodynamics research),
as well as small-scale transmission histories and within-
host evolutionary processes, including adaptation and
recombination. It is our objective to gain better insights
into these evolutionary and population genetic processes
and to clarify how they relate to epidemic and disease
dynamics. To this aim we plan to focus on statistical and
computational developments to analyze the increasing
amount of data brought about by massive sequencing
studies, mainly in a framework of Bayesian phylogenetic
inference, for which our research group holds a strong
track record. We also aim to explore the applicability of
novel models and statistical inference tools, developed
as part of our research, in dierent elds of research.
Project
This project focuses on new developments in a popular
Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework (BEAST:
https://github.com/beast-dev/beast-mcmc) and its ap-
plications to important evolutionary problems, with a
particular focus on infectious diseases.
The project involves the development of an integrated
web system and database that allows users to regis-
ter, upload and retrieve sequence data to and from the
database. Each user will be able to determine the shar-
ing policy for the data he/she has provided. Such a
system should be easily distributed so that other re-
search groups can deploy it on their own server(s) and
put it to use without technical interventions. Further,
this system will interface with the BEAST software
package to analyze the sequence data in an ecient
manner. The candidate is expected to design and im-
plement such a system and determine an appropriate
strategy to properly distribute the developed system as
an easily installed/deployed software package.
Additionally, multiple parallelization ideas will be im-
plemented in the BEAST software package. BEAST
is mostly written in Java, with its high-performance
computational library, known as BEAGLE, being im-
plemented in C/C++. The goal is to develop and im-
plement ecient parallelization strategies from both a
computational and a statistical perspective. The com-
putational aspect entails the implementation of pop-
ular routines typically used in computer architecture,
whereas the statistical aspect entails the development
and adaptation of novel transition kernels in a Bayesian
phylogenetic inference framework.July 1, 2017 EvolDir 37
Prole
The candidate for this PhD position should have a
strong quantitative background, and preferably holds
a master's degree in computer science / informatics
(or equivalent through experience), with an interest in
statistics/mathematics and (bio)informatics. The candi-
date hence needs to be experienced in an object-oriented
programming language such as Java or C/C++. The
candidate should be suciently procient in English,
motivated to work in a team and publish his/her nd-
ings, and willing to travel.
Oer
The candidate will be able to perform research in a dy-
namic and multidisciplinary team (computer scientists,
data analysts and evolutionary biologists), housed in the
brand new facilities of the Rega institute at the Univer-
sity hospital campus, and guided by prolic supervisors.
KU Leuven is one of the top universities in Europe and
leads the Reuters ranking of Europe's most innovative
universities for the second year in a row.
The targeted starting date will be October 1st 2017
and the candidate should obtain his/her master's degree
by that time. All applicants are expected to submit a
motivation letter, overview of their study results and
two references (with their contact details).

dure, can be found here: https://icts.kuleuven.be/apps/-

UCalifornia Berkeley
PaleontologyEvoDevo
Tenured faculty position in the area of Paleontology and
Evolutionary Developmental Biology University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley The Department of Integrative Biology
(IB) and the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology
(MCB) at the University of California, Berkeley are
soliciting applications for a 100% (50 % IB, 50% MCB)
time new senior level faculty member actively working at
the interface between the elds of paleontology and evo-
lutionary developmental biology; this position is open
at the tenured level. Potential start date is January 1,
2018 or July 1, 2018.
Through leadership and expertise in the eld of pa-
leontology, and the elds of organismal, evolutionary,
molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, Berke-
ley faculty explore questions in adaptation, speciation,
ecology, and the genetic and genomic events that have
generated organismal diversity. We seek candidates who
work at the interface between paleontology and evolu-
tionary developmental biology to leverage the strengths
of these elds to address any of a number of questions
in evolutionary biology. Areas include (but are not lim-
ited to) the evolution of important transitions such as
the generation of body plans during the Cambrian, the
transition from water to land, the evolution of ight,
and the appearance of developmental novelties.
We envision that the position will create synergies for col-
laborative initiatives in research, teaching and fundrais-
ing. The successful candidate will build bridges across

could also form the basis for successful fundraising in
the future.
Preferred qualications include demonstrated excellence
in research, extensive eld or lab experience, evidence of
outstanding scholarship within a relevant discipline, a
dedication to excellence in teaching at the undergradu-
ate and graduate level, and a commitment to working in
an inclusive and interdisciplinary environment. A Ph.D.

a related eld is required at the time of application.
Serious consideration will be given to the candidate's
potential for success in mentoring Ph.D. students and
teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
We seek someone who combines signicant strength in
an interdisciplinary program that crosses the Depart-
mental boundaries, which will enhance not only our
research standing, but our ability to educate under-
graduates and graduate students at the cutting edge of
interdisciplinary science. Professional service, including
issues of access to and diversity in higher education and
the academic profession will also be considered.
Application Procedure: Applicants who are cur-
rently tenured at an institute of higher education/
are an independent investigator must complete an
online application via the following link: https://-
aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF01343 . If your can-
didacy progresses, you will be asked to provide contact

Main purpose : The four selected PhD students (Mo-
roccan nationals) will be based in Rabat, Morocco and
will have the opportunity to write their thesis under the
additional supervision of Prof. Pierre Rasmont and Prof.
Denis Michez, University of Mons, Belgium, as part of
ICARDA/IUCN/INRA's project \Conservation of polli-
nator diversity for enhanced climate change resilience"
within the Biodiversity and Integrated Gene Manage-
ment Program. This project shall comprehensively in-
troduce the Farming with Alternative Pollinators (FAP)
approach in the MENA-region. Wild pollinators pro-
vide most of the pollination services. They play a major
role in crop pollination and in adaptation to climate
change. Nevertheless, their diversity is in decline in all
continents. FAP is a new approach to trigger farmers'
motivation to enhance habitats for pollinators. The
approach includes FAP-elds with enhanced habitats
and control elds (monoculture) and compares insect
diversity and total net income to develop an incentive
for farmers. The project will also develop the rst in-
ventory of crop pollinators in North Africa. The four
students will contribute to this work and can prepare
their thesis within the project.
We are looking for * 1 Phd student on: Wild pollinators
in mountainous agro-ecosystems * 1 Phd student on:
Wild pollinators in oasis * 1 Phd student for: Long
tongue pollinators * 1 Phd student for: Short tongue
pollinatorsJuly 1, 2017 EvolDir 49
The students can write their thesis within the spectrum
of their main responsibilities: * Regular collection and
identication of pollinator species in FAP and control
elds in Morocco * Measure abundance of pollinators *
Describe the habitat requirements of some main crop
pollinators * Develop nesting support out of local ma-
terial for main crop pollinators * Evaluate impact of
nesting support * Contribute to trainings and eld days
for farmers and extension sta and to the development
of manuals
Education, qualications and experience * MSc in ento-
mology, agronomy or biology, preferably with focus on
pollination; * Excellent written and oral communication

Developing a statistically powerful measure for quartet
tree inference using phylogenetic and Markov invariants
Barbara Holland University of Tasmania Thursday, June
22, 2017, 2:00 PM PDT
Recently there has been renewed interest in phyloge-
netic inference methods based on phylogenetic invari-
ants, alongside the related Markov invariants. Broadly
speaking, both these approaches give rise to polynomial
functions of sequence site patterns that, in expectation
value, either vanish for particular evolutionary trees (in
the case of phylogenetic invariants) or have well under-
stood transformation properties (in the case of Markov
invariants).
While both approaches have been valued for their in-
trinsic mathematical interest, it is not clear how they
relate to each other, and to what extent they can be
used as practical tools for inference of phylogenetic trees.
By focusing on the special case of binary sequence data
and quartets of taxa, we are able to view these two dif-
ferent polynomial-based approaches within a common
framework.
We present three desirable statistical properties that we
argue any invariant-based phylogenetic method should
satisfy: (1) sensible behaviour under reordering of input
sequences; (2) stability as the taxa evolve independently
according to a Markov process; and (3) explicit depen-
dence on the assumption of a continuous-time process.
Motivated by these statistical properties, we develop
and explore several new phylogenetic inference methods.
In particular, we develop a statistically bias-corrected
version of the Markov invariants approach which satis-
es all three properties. We also extend previous work
by showing that the phylogenetic invariants can be im-
plemented in such a way as to satisfy property (3). A
simulation study shows that, in comparison to other
methods, our new proposed approach based on bias-
corrected Markov invariants is extremely powerful for
phylogenetic inference.

acetosella
Hello,
For a range-wide phylogeographical study, we need sam-
ples of the rhizomatous owering ower plant Oxalis
acetosella. This species, commun in most of Europe and
parts of Asia, can be found in moist woods, moorland
and shady habitat. Regarding the sampling protocol,
this is simple. We only need one individual sampled per
population. A population is here dened as any isolated
individual or cluster of individuals which are distant of
10m from the next isolated or cluster of individuals. To
sample a population, just collect the 3 to 9 youngest
leaves of a single rosette (individual) of Oxalis acetosella
within the population. Collect only safe leaves (no hole
or sign of herbivory, no chlorosis or virus attack). Put
the fresh leaves in an envelope (standar small paper
envelope) with GPS coordinates of that population writ-
ten on the envelope or at least the name of the locality
but lat/long coordinates is the best. So, one enveloppe
per population. If you could then collect several popu-
lations (15 would be ideal, so 15 envelopes total) from
the same forest patch but which are not too close from
each others (cf. populations >10m away), this would be
optimal. The idea is to collect several (when available)
populations from a given forest patch so that the sample
is representative of the sampled forest patch.
When you are done, put all collected populations from
the sampled forest patch (cf. all envelopes with coor-
dinates written on it) in another bigger envelope and
send it to this address:

Software DAMBE update
Dear Colleagues,
I have updated the PhyPA function (Phylogenetics from
pairwise alignment):
1. Now it can really work with homologous sequences as
long as the titin sequences ( ~100,000) accurately, and
it does not require a lot of memory because it uses a
fast/accurate anchored alignment illustrated with two
sequences below:
S1 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAACGT-
TACTTNNNNNNNNNNNNGCGGATTT-
TNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
S2 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAACGT-
TACTTNNNNNNNNNNNNGCGGATTT-
TNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
DAMBE will rst nd the non-overlapping highly ho-
mologous segments that I call sequence anchors (there
are two such anchors above), so alignment needs to be
done only for segments before, after and between the
anchors. It takes little computational time to nd the
sequence anchors, which is obvious for anyone who have
used BLAST or FASTA suites of programs.
2. The function is now available in the Mac and Linux
version of DAMBE.
A new version has been uploaded to http://-
dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/DAMBE/dambe.aspx. Please try
it and you will be impressed.
PS. I have also included a number of functions to au-
tomate the supermatrix approach. That is, for a set of
species, you have compiled a number of le each con-
taining a set of homologous sequences, e.g., Gene1.fas.
Gene2.fas, etc. Each le may contain a subset of the
species, e.g., Gene1.fas may contain 20 Gene1 sequences
from 20 species, Gene2.fas may contain 15 Gene2 se-
quences from 15 species, and so on. You want to align-
ment them by MAFFT or MUSCLE (You need to down-
load MAFFT and MUSCLE and save them on your
computer so that DAMBE can use them) and then
concatenate them into a single le in the form of
Sp1 ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT Sp2 ACG-
TACGTACGTACGTACGT Sp3 ACGTACG-
TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-
TACGT... Sp4 ACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-
TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT... Sp5 ||||||{ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT... Sp6
||||||{ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT... Sp7
||||||{ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT... Sp8
||||||{ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT...
(You need a equal-spaced font sush as courier font to
see sequences above properly. It results from the rst
le containing four sequences, the second le containing
six, with Sp3 and Sp4 present in both les)
All these can be done in a few clicks.
There is also a function for evaluating MAFFT and
MUSCLE alignment based on the sum of all pairwise
alignment scores (SP). Once you have aligned N se-
quence les with MAFFT or MUSCLE, you may wish
to have something like this:
File MAFFT SP MUSCLE SP Gene1.fas 1323445
1323400 Gene2.fas 1323445 1323400 ...
This helps you to decide which alignment le (MAFFT-
aligned or MUSCLE-aligned) you should use in assem-
bling the nal supermatrix. With the most accurate
options for both, MAFFT performs a bit better than
MUSCLE based on this criterion. For 100 les aligned
by either MAFFT or MUSCLE, you may nd about 40
MAFFT-aligned les with high PS than the correspond-
ing MUSCLE-aligned les, about 10 MUSCLE-aligned
les with high PS than MAFFT-aligned les, and the
rest being equal. This function is under the 'Alignment'
menu.

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
I have implemented bootstrapping with the PhyPA
method for those who have requested. A new version of
DAMBE has been uploaded. Please download and try it.
Keep in mind that PhyPA is really for highly diverged
sequences. For lowly diverged sequences from which a
reliable multiple sequence alignment can be obtained,
maximum likelihood methods are better.
For those who have not heard of PhyPA or DAMBE:
PhyPA is phylogenetics with pairwise alignment, and
DAMBE is a comprehensive software for data analysis
in molecular biology and evolution.

research is conducted as part of the Detection Dogs for
Conservation Program (https://www.usc.edu.au/DDC),
which uses specially trained detection dogs to study and
protect koalas.
The eld assistant will be helping me organise and con-
duct surveys of koala habitat (i.e. bushland vegetation)with a detection dog specially trained on the odour of
koala scats. We will be searching for koalas and their
scats and recording habitat characteristics in the More-
ton Bay, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Gympie and Fraser
Coast Council regions of south-east Queensland.
This research forms part of a PhD project studying the
distribution, abundance and health status of koalas in
rehabilitated vegetation and is part of a long-term study
of koala behaviour, ecology and genetics.

PlantPhenotypicPlasticity
Multi-trait plasticity in response to a changing climate:
PostDoc position
A position for a post-doctoral fellow is available in the
Division of Evolution and Ecology at the Australian
National University, Canberra, in the groups of Loeske
Kruuk and Adrienne Nicotra, to study multi-trait pheno-
typic plasticity of an alpine plant in response to warming
temperatures.
Phenotypic plasticity, or the ability to change pheno-
type with environment, is the most important process
determining the immediate response of natural popu-
lations to environmental change. However studies of
plasticity frequently rely on simplifying assumptions,
and an understanding of the genomic and epigenomic
mechanisms underlying plasticity is only just emerg-
ing. Using large-scale temperature-manipulation exper-
iments an Australian alpine herb, the waxy bluebell
(Wahlenbergia ceracea), the project will combine ge-
nomic and multivariate statistical analyses to determine
whether multi-trait phenotypic plasticity is adaptive,
whether it can evolve, and what are the (epi)genomic
mechanisms driving it. The ultimate aim is both to ex-
plore fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions
and to provide insights into the impact of environmen-
tal change on alpine ora. The project constitute an
exciting opportunity for highly-motivated postdoctoral
and PhD researchers with experience and interest in
evolutionary ecology, quantitative genetic and genomic
analyses, and/or plant thermal biology.
The project is funded by an Australia Research Council

EvolutionaryGenomics
ERC.2.EvolutionaryGenomics
Postdocs in evolutionary genomics and phylogenomics
are available to join the ERC 'GENECLOCKS' project
(http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/207593 en.html)
headed by Gergely Szollosi (http://ssolo.web.elte.hu)
. Two positions are oered for 2 years with the
possibility of extension up until the 2021 end date of
the GENECLOCKS project. The position comes with
a salary of up to EUR 43,200 per year (approx. up to
EUR 2,400-2,900 net per month after taxes), as well as
a travel and research funds.
We are looking for an individual who received his or
her PhD preferably within the last six years, who is
highly self-motivated and can work independently on a
project that he or she will help develop in the context
of GENECLOCKS.
A central theme of GENECLOCKS is disclosing new
sources of information for dating the rst three-quarters
of Earth's evolutionary history that are independent
from both fossils and molecular clocks. Life's early his-
tory has remained terra incognita until now, because
the fossils needed to calibrate standard evolutionary
timescales are simply not available for microbial life.
Microbial fossils are scarce and dicult to interpret in a
phylogenetic context with condence. In previous work
we have shown that patterns of lateral gene transfer
inferred from modern genomes encode a record of co-
existing lineages throughout the history of life, and that
we can use this record to reconstruct the relative ages
of microbial groups from the three domains of life in
deep time.
This discovery is a game changer for anyone interested
in the history of life, from either a geological or genomic
perspective. It demonstrates the existence of a new
and abundant source of dating information that is in-
scribed in the genome of any organism, provided a gene
transfer occurred in its ancestry. This constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the diversity of life.
Postdocs will undertake projects together with interna-
tional collaborators with the goal of either i) developing
new methods that systematically extract information on
the pattern and timing of genomic evolution by explain-
ing dierences between gene trees, or ii) apply existingmethods to resolve the timing of microbial evolution and
its relationship to Earth history and answer long stand-
ing questions. Possible collaborations and associated
projects include:
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Bacteria in collab-
oration with Vincent Daubin at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing and implementing bayesian methods for the
species tree aware reconstruction of gene trees with
Nicolas Lartillot at the LBBE in Lyon.
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Eukaryotes includ-
ing their position within Archaea in collaboration with
Tom Williams at the University of Bristol.
Developing and implementing new methods for species
tree reconstruction in the context of hierarchical gene
tree-species tree methods with Jens Lagergren at the
Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm.
Implementing and applying methods to include trans-
fer derived relative age constraints in molecular clock
estimates with Bastien Boussau at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing novel gene tree-species tree reconciliation
methods that model correlated gene histories with Eric
Tannier at LBBE in Lyon.
Research visits of up to several months are foreseen as
part of potential collaborations.
To be considered, please send a single merged PDF to
ssolo@elte.hu that contains your CV including publica-
tion list, preferably with a link to your google scholar
prole, academic transcripts, a statement of research
interests (3 pages or less) as well as three academic
references. Please include 'GENECLOCKS17' in the
subject of your email. Applications will be considered
until October 1st, 2017, or until the position is lled.
The position is available from the fall or winter of 2017.

*Position Summary*
The APC Microbiome Institute is a trans-disciplinary
research centre, with clinicians, clinician-scientists and
basic scientists from diverse backgrounds working in
teams, sharing ideas and resources. Although focused
upon the gastrointestinal bacterial community (the mi-
crobiota), the scale and scope of the work has become
one of the fastest moving areas of biology. The micro-
biota is not only a target for treatment and prevention of
disease, it is a repository for functional food ingredients
and even new drugs and is a source of novel biomarkers
of disease risk. The scientic organisation of the APC
consists of a matrix of 'spokes' or themes of intellectual
pursuit.
This position is within APC's Gut Phageomics Labo-
ratory, consisting of up to 20 researchers investigating
the role of the gut phageome in health and disease. The
Research Fellow will work within APC's 'Spoke 5' which
is collaborating with a major multi-national pharma-
ceutical company to explore the role of bacteriophagesJuly 1, 2017 EvolDir 63

uals who have personally secured their own independent
external research funding inclusive of their salary fol-
lowing an open, transparent and competitive selection
process by the research funding body or who have been
appointed by the HEI following an open competition.
The Research Fellow would still be associated with a
Principal Investigator who would act as mentor and
facilitate access to research infrastructure.
The role also allows the Research Fellow the professional
development opportunity to demonstrate the capacity
for independent and self-directed research and schol-
arship and the management of a research team. The
role allows the Research Fellow to assemble a portfo-
lio of independent achievement and render themselves

Postdoc position in Amphibian Evolutionary Genomics
(3 years)
A postdoctoral position in amphibian evolutionary
genomics is available in the group of Wies ^A3aw
Babik at the Institute of Environmental Sciences,
Jagiellonian University, Krak ow, Poland (http://-
www.molecol.eko.uj.edu.pl/en GB/zespol/pracownicy/-
wieslaw-babik). The position is within the recently
awarded National Science Centre (NCN) grant \Do
antigen-processing genes coevolve with MHC class I
genes in salamanders?"
Background. Understanding the mechanisms driving
evolution of the genes underlying adaptive immunity
is of major scientic importance and has implications
for conservation. In this project we will test whether64 EvolDir July 1, 2017
Antigen Processing Genes (APG) coevolve with Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I genes in
salamanders. Coevolution has been suggested as the
ancestral vertebrate condition, potentially limiting the
eciency and exibility of adaptive immunity. Selection
pressure to remove this constraint is therefore expected
in multiple evolutionary lineages. Limited information
available for salamanders reveals intriguing patterns of
MHC I and APG variation, making this group ideal
for testing the coevolution hypothesis and providing
fundamental insights into the evolution of the adaptive
immunity.
Job description. The postdoc will test predictions of
the coevolution hypothesis. More specically (s)he will:
i) resequence the focal genes in multiple species from
several families, ii) perform bioinformatics analysis of
resequencing data, iii) test for correlation between APG
and MHC variation iv) look for signatures of adaptive
evolution. (S)he will work together with the PI and
other team members, including a network of interna-
tional collaborators.
Requirements. The suitable candidate will have a PhD
degree obtained not earlier than in 2010 (extensions
for parental leave apply), be uent in English and have
strong interest in evolutionary genomics. The candidate
should have Linux/scripting language skills, experience
in bioinformatics analysis of DNA sequence data and
background in population genetics; background in molec-
ular evolution will be an advantage. Employment: full
time research-only for three years. Salary: ca. 6500
PLN gross (before tax, includes benets).
How to apply. For informal enquiries email wies-
law.babik@uj.edu.pl. The application (a single pdf le)
should include: statement of research interests, CV with
the list of publications, contact information for two ref-
erees and scan of the PhD certicate. Please send the
application by email to: wieslaw.babik@uj.edu.pl no

Montpellier MicrobialAdaptation
18 months Postdoct position in mathematical evolution-
ary biology in Montpellier: modelling adaptation and
demography in microbes (using PDEs and stochastic
processes).
Project description: A postdoctoral position (co-funded
by Labex CEMEB, NUMEV and AGRO) is available
at the University of Montpellier, France. The postdoc-
toral fellow will develop analytical models of adaptation
dynamics coupled with non-equilibrium demographic
dynamics ('evolutionary rescue' ER), in asexual micro-
bial populations facing a harsh environmental challenge.
These dynamics have wide applications in health and
agronomy: antibiotic resistance, cancer emergence and
relapse after treatment, host shifts in pathogens etc. The
goal of the project is to develop a theoretical framework
that accounts for a complex genetic basis of adaptation
to stress, and for various scenarios of environmental
change. The main activity of the postdoctoral fellow
will be theory development but he/she will interact
with people ranging from mathematicians to empiricists.
If interested, he/she may participate to the design or
analysis of experiments, ongoing in the host lab, on
the probability and dynamics of antibiotic resistance
emergence across doses and drug combinations in the
bacterium E.coli .
Tools and skills: The postdoctoral fellow will use
phenotype-tness landscapes (Fisher's geometric model)68 EvolDir July 1, 2017
to describe adaptation to environmental change (abrupt
or not). He/she will analyze the resulting multi-type
stochastic birth-death model for the demographic dy-
namics. The resulting dynamical system will be simpli-
ed by taking relevant statistical limits, using Partial
Dierential Equations (PDE) governing the joint distri-
bution of birth and death rates in the population, over
time, following a method recently developed in ( Martin
and Roques 2016 , Gil et al. 2017 ).
The candidate should have experience in at least one
of the three following elds: analytical modelling in
population biology (ecology, evolution), PDE analysis
or stochastic processes.
Research and life environment: The researcher will be
working under the joint supervision of Drs. Guillaume
Martin (evolutionary theory/experimental evolution),
Matthieu Alfaro (analysis of PDEs) and Bertrand Cloez
(stochastic processes), and in collaboration with O.
Ronce (evolutionary ecology) and L. Roques (analysis
of PDEs). The three host labs are within close dis-
tance of each other in the Montpellier University area.
They also provide extensive computational facilities for
individual-based simulations. Montpellier provides a
very dynamic environment to develop multidisciplinary
research in mathematics and biology. It is also an inter-
national center of ecological and evolutionary research
(next ESEB-ASSE joint conference will be held in Mont-
pellier in 2018). Additionally, it is a lively and culturally
rich city on the Mediterranean coast, and has beautiful
surroundings.
Salary, duration and eligibility : Net salary is approxi-
mately 2100 euro /months plus 100 euro /months supple-
ment per year of postdoctoral experience. The duration
of the postdoc is 18 months, possibly prolonged to 24
months and the contract must start no later than 1 st
January 2018, and be signed no later than 25 th August
2017. The candidate must have a PhD from any struc-
ture outside the three Montpellier Labex CEMEB, NU-
MEV or AGRO. The candidate must have no more than
six years of postdoctoral experience. For candidates with
more than two years postdoctoral experience, they must
have spent no more than one year in France over the
past three years. One page applications with a cover let-
ter and CV (publications may include submitted Arxiv
or Bioarxiv drafts) should be sent as a single pdf-le to
Guillaume Martin ( guillaume.martin@umontpellier.fr
), Matthieu Alfaro ( matthieu.alfaro@umontpellier.fr )
and Bertrand Cloez ( bertrand.cloez@inra.fr ). Review
of applications will run until 24 th July 2017 and nal
decision will be given by 28 th July 2017.

Description: A postdoctoral position is available in the
laboratories of Drs. Steve Dorus and Scott Pitnick in the
Center for Reproductive Evolution (cre.syr.edu) at Syra-
cuse University. The broad goal of this NSF-funded, col-
laborative research project (with Dr. Mariana Wolfner,
Cornell University) is to determine how molecular inter-
actions between sperm and the female reproductive tract
evolve across closely related species and their contribu-
tion to reproductive isolation. Sperm undergo numerous
modications as they move through the male and female
reproductive tracts, although the nature of these inter-
actions and their importance for fertilization success is
not well understood. This project will characterize these
changes at the molecular level, within closely-related
species of fruit y, as well as following hybrid insemi-
nations, to understand their evolutionary history and
inuence on sperm survival and fertilization success.
Qualications: PhD in Genetics, Genomics, Evolution
or a related eld is required, and the candidate should
have a demonstrated history of research excellence. Pref-
erence will be given to candidates with a strong back-
ground in molecular evolution, genomics and/or pro-
teomics of reproductive systems. Experience conducting
research with Drosophila or other insects would be ben-
ecial, but is not required.
Details: The start date for this position is exible but
could be as early as 9/1/17. Funding is available for
up to three years (conditional on satisfactory perfor-
mance). All enquiries should be sent to Steve Dorus
(sdorus@syr.edu) and Scott Pitnick (sspitnic@syr.edu).
Applications: Interested individuals should submit a
cover letter, CV, a short statement of research inter-
ests, and the contact information of 3 or 4 references to

tions remain and recent perspective papers have thus
emphasized the need of studying the interaction between
non-pathogenic bacteria and host behavior. In particu-
lar, bacteria can inuence host behavior indirectly by
aecting chemical cues that animals use to communicate.
The fermentation hypothesis for animal olfactory signal-
ing posits that bacteria metabolize glandular secretions
and produce volatile, organic compounds, that are used
in communication by the host. However, despite the
potential importance of microbes in the olfactory com-
munication of their host, very few studies have focused
on the microbiota of animal scent integuments.
The main objective of the project is to inquire whether
bacteria in scent integument may be responsible for
the production of social odors in birds. However, the
research objective is not set and may depend on the
research interests of the successful candidate. Among
others, it may involve i) testing the covariation between
olfactory cues and bacterial communities in scent in-
teguments, ii) combining chemical analyses with in-vitro
cultures of the specic bacterial strains found in the
scent integuments to determine to what extent bacteria
produce the compounds used by birds to communicate
with their conspecics, or iii) testing the role of immune
genes (known to aect bird odor) on bird microbiota.
A sound knowledge of chemical ecology and associated
techniques (GC-MS) is essential. Previous experience
in bacterial culture is not a pre-requisite, but some ex-
perience in laboratory work (DNA extraction, PCR,
etc.) is particularly desirable. Some experience withnext-generation sequencing data would be an asset.
This 1-year position is expected to start in Septem-
ber 2017. It will be based in Toulouse at \Lab-
oratoire Evolution & Diversit e Biologique" (CNRS).

EvolutionAntibioticResistance
A two-year post-doctoral position is available (start date
exible, can start as early as July, 2017) in the labs of
Dr. Pamela Yeh and Dr. Van Savage in the Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA. Yeh
works on evolution of antibiotic resistance and devel-
opment of novel strategies to combat multi-drug resis-
tant pathogens. Savage combines mathematical models
with analysis of large datasets to uncover insights into
biological systems. The overall goal is to better under-
stand, both empirically and theoretically, higher-order
interactions in biological systems and/or experimental
evolution of antibiotic resistance. In this context, higher-
order interactions means beyond pairwise interactions
that involve three or more objects. The project has
the potential to involve experiments, theory develop-
ment, numerical simulations, and data analysis. Yeh
and Savage will both mentor the postdoc in designing
and conducting research projects, writing papers, giving
talks, and applying for jobs.
UCLA is a major research university with the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences, Medical School, and Engineering
School all on the same campus, allowing access to myr-
iad researchers and resources that could be useful to
this project. UCLA is consistently in the top 5 in terms
of federal research funding awarded to universities. Los
Angeles is a vibrant, diverse city with outdoor activi-
ties available nearby, including beaches and mountains.
L.A. also has a wide array of arts and culture, includ-
ing world-class museums, theater, music, and of course,
movies.
Candidates are expected to be independent, highly moti-
vated problem solvers who communicate well and enjoy
working in a collaborative environment. The ideal candi-
date would have a background in evolution, microbiology,
or mathematical modeling. Experience with program-
ming languages such as Matlab, R, Mathematica, C, andJuly 1, 2017 EvolDir 77

ULeeds GenomicsSenescence
SeychellesWarbler
3-year Post-doctoral Research Fellow in Genomics of
Senescence in the Seychelles warbler
Are you an ambitious researcher looking for your next
challenge? Do you have an established background in
evolutionary genomics, quantitative genetics or a related
relevant discipline?
As individuals reach older ages their bodies deteriorate -
a process known as senescence. It is clear that individu-
als dier greatly in the age at which they start to senesce,
and how quickly they then deteriorate. However, why
individuals senesce so dierently remains unresolved.
Understanding this question is fundamentally important
from an evolutionary perspective. It also has massive
ramications for human health, animal husbandry and
conservation, as reducing exposure to factors that neg-
atively impact senescence would enable individuals to
live longer healthier lives
You will work on the Natural Environment Research
Council funded project 'The genomics of senescence
in the Seychelles warbler' which is led by Dr Hannah
Dugdale (Leeds) and Professor David Richardson (East
Anglia), in collaboration with Professor Terry Burke
(Sheeld) and Professor Jan Komdeur (Groningen).
The project uses the outstanding Seychelles warbler
dataset, a major model system in the study of evolution,cooperative breeding and senescence. Crucially, this
study focuses on an isolated island population, which
has allowed us to follow all individuals (over many gen-
erations) throughout their lives, collect blood samples
(thus allowing individual genetic characteristics and
intrinsic biomarkers to be measured) and measure con-
current environmental conditions, social experiences and
individual characteristics.
You will oversee the collation of genomic data and the
quantitative genetic analysis of senescence. You will
quantify the overall relative impact of environmental,
social, transgenerational and genetic factors, across the
genome, on when and how quickly individuals deteri-
orate with age. There will be an opportunity to get
involved in the other components of the wider Seychelles
warbler project, including eldwork.
You will have a PhD in evolutionary genomics, quanti-
tative genetics or a closely allied discipline along with
experience in generating and analysing data using bioin-
formatics, quantitative genetics and statistical skills in
R.
Interviews are expected to take place between 18 July
and 20 July 2017.

TreePathogenDiversity
The Garnas lab (http://colsa.unh.edu/faculty/garnas)
seeks a highly motivated postdoctoral scientist to study
1) patterns and consequences of microbial diversity in
the beech bark disease (BBD) pathogen complex and as-
sociated bark communities; and 2) impacts of divergent
life histories among the dominant BBD associates on
pathogen gene ow and population structure across the
range of the disease. Within this framework, the success-
ful candidate will be encouraged to develop his/her own
ideas to advance basic and applied knowledge around
fungal evolution in the context of a complex, multi-
player decline disease.
Brief background
Beech bark disease (BBD) is a widespread decline disease
arising from complex interactions among a non-native
scale insect and at least two putatively native pathogens
that dier in key aspects of their biology and ecology.
Recent work also suggests that associated microbes may
play a role in disease development and/or attenuation.
In addition to being highly relevant ecologically (e.g.,
to wildlife and to forest stand development), the BBD
system represents fertile ground for scientic inquiry,
with many key questions that are currently unexplored.
Details of the position and skills sought
The ideal candidate will have both experience and aproven publication record that demonstrates a keen in-
terest and background in population genetics and/or
bioinformatics as well as facility with the core concepts
of eco-evolutionary dynamics. While the research will
be primarily lab and bioinformatics-based, a non-trivial
eld component to help augment current collections
across the range of the disease may be required, together
with fungal isolation and culture curation. Experience
working with fungi is preferred but not required.
Funding is for 2 years at with an annual salary
of $48K plus benets. Target start date is Oc-
tober 1, 2017 <http://airmail.calendar/2017-10-
01%2012:00:00%20EDT >.

*One-year position, starting in December 2017. Appli-
cation before 15th July 2017.*
We are seeking a skilled and enthusiastic post-doctoral
research associate to collaborate on a project funded
by the French ANR (Study of endophytic fungi: ex-
ploring and valorizing antibacterial metabolites; http:/-
/secil.obs-banyuls.fr). The goal of the project is to
explore the biodiversity and the biochemistry of foliar
endophytic fungi. We seek to test whether dierences
of endophytes communities among hosts reect a strong
spatial structure or host specicity, and if host speci-
city follows host phylogeny or correlate with functional
traits. The project will be based on a sampling of over
a thousand leaf samples in a primary forest canopy in
French Guiana, taking advantage of the COPAS sys-
tem (Nouragues station). Surface-sterilized leaf samples
span a range of canopy tree species. Total DNA will
be extracted and amplication will be conducted with
DNA primers specic to fungi and bacteria. In addition,
leaf traits will be collected. This will generate one of the
largest surveys of endophytic communities ever collected
in a tropical forest, and will be used to test hypotheses
of community assembly and species coexistence. The
applicant will be in charge of data analysis, and interpre-
tation. Relations with the other teams in ANR SECIL
will be encouraged.
The position is open at the EDB research unit (Evolution

Tony Capra and Antonis Rokas at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville, TN.
The successful candidate will lead our eorts to inte-
grate diverse evolutionary and 'omic data from contexts
relevant to pregnancy to identify novel candidate genetic
loci for preterm birth risk. The project will leverage Van-
derbilt's unique BioVU biobank of more than 230,000
patient DNA samples linked to electronic health records
(https://victr.vanderbilt.edu/pub/biovu/) to validate
the clinical relevance of our candidates and better map
the genetic architecture of preterm birth. We also col-
laborate closely with wet lab biologists in the March
of Dimes Prematurity Research Center Ohio Collabo-
rative, and the successful candidate will help coordi-
nate further testing of novel ndings in model systems.
New algorithms and data from these projects will be
integrated into our popular GEneSTATION (http://-
www.genestation.org/) web data portal for the study of
the genetics and evolution of pregnancy. There is also
substantial room for the design and leadership of new
projects at the intersection of the genetics and evolution
of human pregnancy.90 EvolDir July 1, 2017
A record of successful publications and a PhD in bioin-
formatics, genetics, computer science, statistics, or a
similar discipline is required. Programming, analytical
skills, and the ability to synthesize large omics data sets
are essential for this position. Knowledge of pregnancy,
reproductive biology, and evolution are preferred, but
not strictly necessary.
Interested applicants should email a CV
and cover letter outlining qualications and
research interests to both: Tony Capra

Rokas <antonis.INSERTLASTNAME@vanderbilt.edu >
Please include the phrase \Postdoc Application" in the
subject and provide contact information for three refer-
ences.
The focus of the Capra Lab is comparative and evo-
lutionary genomics. In addition to our work on the
genetics and evolution of pregnancy, we have active
projects investigating gene regulatory changes in recent
human evolution, modeling eects of genetic variation
on protein structures, and evaluating the eects of ad-
mixture with archaic groups on modern humans. For
more information about the group and our work, visit
http://www.capralab.org/ . The Rokas Lab focuses on
the study of the DNA record to gain insight into the pat-
terns and processes of evolution. We do so using both
computational and experimental approaches and focus
on three major research themes; the evolution of human
pregnancy, the evolution of fungal chemodiversity, and
phylogenomics. More information is available at http:/-

YaleU 2 PlantEvolutionaryBiology
Two post-doctoral positions in plant evolutionary biol-
ogyThe Edwards lab is moving to the Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, and
we are looking for two post-doctoral research associates
to join our ongoing eorts focused on the evolution of
C4 and CAM photosynthesis in the Caryophyllales. One
position will be primarily responsible for the molecu-
lar/phylogenomic aspects of the project, and the sec-
ond will take the lead in physiological/anatomical work.
The overarching goal is to develop an integrative and
detailed model of C3 to CAM, C3 to C4, and CAM
to C4 evolutionary trajectories that can explain the
repeated emergence of C4 and CAM syndromes in par-
ticular angiosperm lineages. While some goals are quite
rm (e.g., improved phylogenies for several clades within
Caryophyllales), there will be plenty of opportunity to
develop other projects based on the applicant's own
interests- this will be actively encouraged.
The successful candidates will be highly motivated, in-
dependent, careful scientists and team players, with
proven track records in creative project design, data
collection, analysis, and publication. Good computing
and analytical skills are essential qualities.
The position start date is exible, and the ini-
tial appointment will be for one year, with an op-
portunity for extension depending on performance.
To apply, please send a research statement, a cur-
rent CV, and contact information for three refer-
ences (and please, send this as a single PDF doc-
ument) to Erika Edwards (erika.edwards@yale.edu
<mailto:erika edwards@brown.edu >). Applications will
be reviewed starting immediately and accepted until
the positions are lled. In accordance with Title IX
policy and as delineated by federal and Connecticut law,
Yale does not discriminate in admissions, educational
programs, or employment against any individual on ac-
count of that individual's sex, race, color, religion, age,
disability, status as a protected veteran, or national or
ethnic origin; nor does Yale discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.

Berlin EukaryoticMetabarcoding
Feb26-Mar2
Dear all,
We are pleased to announce that the 2nd edition of
Eukaryotic Metabarcoding Workshop will take place
from February 26th to March 2nd, 2018 in Berlin
(Germany): https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course4/ Instructors
Dr Owen S. Wangensteen (University of Salford, UK)/
MSc Vasco Elbrecht (University of Duisburg-Essen, Ger-
many)
Overview:
Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic
tools for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing bio-
diversity of natural communities. Their potential appli-
cations include (but are not limited to) accurate water
quality, soil diversity assessment, trophic analyses of
digestive contents, diagnosis of health status of sh-
eries, early detection of non-indigenous species, studies
of global ecological patterns and biomonitoring of an-
thropogenic impacts. This workshop gives an overview
of metabarcoding procedures with an emphasis on prac-
tical problem-solving and hands-on work using analysispipelines on real datasets. After completing the work-
shop, students should be in a position to (1) understand
the potential and capabilities of metabarcoding, (2) run
complete analyses of metabarcoding pipelines and obtain
diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable data
from raw next-generation sequence data and (3) design
their own metabarcoding projects, including bioinfor-
matic data analysis and planning of laboratory work. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
Intended audience:
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research and at researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing com-
munity of metabarcoders worldwide. This workshop
will review mostly techniques and software useful for
eukaryotic metabarcoding. Other workshops focused on
procedures currently used in microbial metabarcoding
will be available from Physalia-courses.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours
of practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's
discretion.
Assumed background:
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments, with some
ssh connections to remote servers. For Windows users,
a virtual box running Linux under Windows and/or
the installation of an ssh client (e.g. PuTTY) will be
needed. For MacOSX systems, installation of some ad-
ditional Python packages might be needed for running
the OBITools software suite. The syllabus has been
planned for people which have some previous experience
running simple commands from a terminal in Linux or
Mac and using the R environment (preferently RStudio)
for performing basic plots and statistical procedures.
You will need to have a laptop with Python 2.7 installed
for running OBITools, but no experience with Python
is necessary. If in doubt, take a look at the detailed
session content below or send an email to us.
Course programme:94 EvolDir July 1, 2017
Monday 26th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1. Introduction to metabarcoding procedures.
The metabarcoding pipeline.
In this session students will be introduced to the key con-
cepts of metabarcoding and the dierent next-generation
sequencing platforms currently available for implement-
ing this technology. Some examples of results that can
be obtained from metabarcoding projects are explained.
We will outline the dierent steps of a typical metabar-
coding pipeline and introduce some key concepts. We
will also explain the format of the course. In this session,
we will check that the computing infrastructure for the
rest of the course is in place and all the needed software
is installed. Core concepts introduced: high-throughput
sequencing, multiplexing, NGS library, metabarcoding
pipeline, metabarcoding marker, clustering algorithms,
molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU), taxo-
nomic assignment.
Session 2. Molecular laboratory protocols. DNA extrac-
tion. Metabarcoding markers. Primer design. PCR and
library preparation. Good laboratory practice.
In this session we will learn the basics about molec-
ular laboratory procedures needed for metabarcoding.
While there will be no hands-on laboratory practices,
guidelines and best practices for all key laboratory steps
will be discussed. We will explain sample collection
techniques,

Berlin GenomicVisualizationsInR
Sep11-15
Dear all,
we still have a few spots available for the Workshop
\Genomic Data Visualization and Interpretation".
11th-15th September, Berlin (Germany)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course14/ Topic: Advanced R and bioinformatics
applications for visualization and interpretation of
genomic data.
Length: 5 days ( ~9.30 AM to 5.30 PM with breaks)Instructors: Dr Obi Grith and Dr Malachi Grith
(Washington University School of Medicine)
Course overview
The advent of rapid and relatively cheap massively par-
allel sequencing has dramatically increased the availabil-
ity of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome proling.
Analysis workows and published best practices are
also now available to process raw sequence data into
alignments, variant calls, expression estimates, etc., in
relatively standardized le formats. Interpretation and
visualization of these data, often consisting of thousands
to billions of data points, and extracting biological mean-
ing remains a serious challenge. In this workshop we will
explore a number of best-in-class visualization tools, and
provide working examples that demonstrate important
principles of 'omic interpretation strategies.
Workshop format
The workshop will be delivered over the course of ve
days. Each day will include an introductory lecture with
class discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each
day will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These
sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring
exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as
well as applying these skills on your own to complete
complete individual exercises. After and during each
exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a
group. Computing will be done using a combination of
tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and
web resources accessed via web browser.
Who should attend
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers who are analyzing some kind of omic data (e.g.
WGS, exome, RNA-seq, variant les, etc.). Examples
demonstrated in this course will involve primarily human
genome/transcriptome data but many of the concepts
learned will be applicable to model organisms, metage-
nomics, simulated data, etc.
Requirements
Attendees should have a background in biology and
a basic knowledge of R. We will dedicate one session
to a brief R/linux primer. Attendees should have also
some familiarity with genomic data. The course will
teach relatively advanced usage of R (especially ggplot2
and Bioconductor packages). Attendees should have a
working installation of R and RStudio on their laptop.
Example data
Attendees will learn to visualize and interpret results
from real human genome data sets generated at the
McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University
School of Medicine. These data will be analyzed to de-July 1, 2017 EvolDir 95
termine previously known as well as potentially novel in-
terpretations. Since the example data are not simulated
or arbitrarily ltered, interpretation and visualization
will be performed in the context of representative levels
of sequence error, and other sources of technical and
biological noise.

Berlin LandscapeGenomics Nov6-10
Dear all,
registration is now open for the course \Land-
scape Genomics" : https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course17/, https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course17/ 6-10 Novem-
ber, Berlin (Germany).
Instructors: Dr.St ephane Joost and Oliver Salmoni, (
Laboratory of Geographic Information System (LASIG),
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne
(EPFL)). St ephane is specialized in the contribution
of Geographic Information Science for the conservation
of plant and animal genetic resources. He applies spatial
statistics and geocomputation methods to conservation
genetics and landscape genomics (https://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t13/).
Course Overview
Landscape genomics is an emerging research eld that
studies how genetic diversity distributes across space and
how environmental features can modify this structure
through local adaptation. In this workshop, students
will learn the basics of this approach and train using
state of the art methods. The course will provide an
overview of the type of dataset that can be used for
a landscape genomics analysis. Firstly, students will
learn how to obtain environmental data from publicly
available databases, how to process it with Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) and how to use the latter to
produce indicators able to describe the characteristics96 EvolDir July 1, 2017
of the landscape. Next, the course will discuss the dier-
ent approaches to obtain genetic data and subsequently
show how to study genetic variation and population
structure across space in the R environment. Students
will be given an overview of the dierent statistical ap-
proaches to study local adaptation, and will be trained
in using two of them, Sambada and LFMM. The course
will also cover the critical task of the interpretation and
validation of the results. Finally, the workshop will con-
sider the crucial aspects and good habits to account for
when planning a landscape genomics experiment (e.g.
sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This workshop is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, ge-
neticists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evo-
lutionary biology and conservation. Even though the
course is not intended for a specialized audience, basic
knowledge in evolutionary biology and population ge-
netics would help. Students will learn how to use GIS,
but basic computer skills are desirable (e.g. in the R
environment). A basic understanding of statistics is also
necessary.
Teaching Format
The course is organized in ten learning sessions. During
the rst two sessions, the course will provide a contex-
tualization of the research eld. Then, students will be
guided through a landscape genomics experiment with
sessions that couple brief theoretical introductions with
practical work.

3) Practical GWAS using Linux and R. 23-27 October
2017, Berlin (Germany).
Instructor: Dr. Jing Hua Zhao (University of Cambridge
School of Clinical Medicine, UK)
Course overview
The past decade has witnessed an astonishing develop-
ment and the universal use of genome wide association
studies (GWAS) in identication and characterisation
of genetic variants underlying disorders and other varia-
tions in human and other species, which has an immense
impact in biomedical research. This is owing to the abil-
ity to eciently generate and process large quantity
of genetic polymorphisms as well as to integrate with
other sources such as gene expression and methylation.
To tackle challenges in GWAS, a lot of methods and
techniques have been established but many others are
still evolving. The workshop therefore intends to give a
grand picture as well as practical aspects of GWAS.

Thematic school
Remote sensing for tropical biodiversity mapping and
management across scales Faculty: David Coomes, Uni-
versity of Cambridge, UK Mathias Disney, University
College London, UK Maria Joao Ferreira dos Santos,
Universiteit Utrecht, Netherlands Jean-Baptiste Feret,
IRSTEA, Montpellier, France Sassan Saatchi, NASA
JPL Pasadena, USA Convenors: Jer0me Chave (CNRS,
Toulouse, France) and Gregoire Vincent (IRD, Montpel-
lier, France) Dates: 25-29 September 2017 Venue: Hotel
des Roches, Kourou, French Guiana Context: Earth
surface is now being sensed continuously at high tem-
poral and spatial resolution by multiple space-borne
instruments.
When combined with appropriate methodologies, these
sources of information will allow monitoring biodiver-
sity at the global scale. In addition, technologically
advanced sensors such as Lidar and imaging spectrom-
eters are becoming increasingly available on airborne
platforms. They are part of the equipment dedicated
to ground observation, and allow an exploration of the
structural heterogeneity of the vegetation, spanning or-
ders of spatial scale. Such technologies already proved
their potential and allow multiple applications for the
monitoring of complex ecosystems.
Objectives: The Thematic School is open in priority, but
not exclusively, to early-career scientists (PhD students,post-doctoral associates) interested in exploring the po-
tential of remote sensing in tropical biodiversity mapping
and management. For instance, canopy heterogeneity
is correlated with insect diversity in tropical forests,
and canopy moisture is a proxy for amphibian diversity.
Environmental variables can also be coupled with biodi-
versity occurrence data using species distribution mod-
elling. Mapping of species richness derived from imaging
spectroscopy is another attractive opportunity. These
techniques have a direct implication for the management
of tropical ecosystems, as they help prioritize areas for
conservation. The week will be organized around work-
ing sessions, evening lectures and will include a visit to a
eld station (Paracou). The participants are expected to
apply with a clearly stated research problem including
already acquired datasets. During the meeting sessions,
they will collaborate with other members of the group.
Teachers will give evening lectures and provide guidance.
Individual projects should result in publishable papers.
How to apply: Applicants should submit their applica-
tion preferably before July 12th, 2017 to Jessica Del-
haye (jessica.delhaye@univ-tlse3.fr). The application
package should include two pdf les: (1) a curriculum
vitae, (2) a motivation letter detailing your proposed
research project and the nature of available datasets.
This could include remote sensing data analysis, biodi-
versity modelling or other questions relevant to tropical
forest biodiversity.
Costs: The program will cover accommodation, meals,
and transport within French Guiana, but not travel
costs to French Guiana.

critical in diverse elds from plant and animal breeding,
human genetics, genomics, behavior, to ecology and
evolutionary biology. The course will cover the basics of
quantitative genetics including: genetic basis for com-
plex traits, population genetic assumptions including
detection of admixture, Fisher's variance decomposi-
tion, covariance between relatives, calculation of the
numerator relationship matrix based on IBD alleles and
an arbitrary pedigree, the genomic relationship matrix
based on AIS alleles, heritability in the broad and nar-

BACKGROUND Within the scope of the DFG funded
Virtual Fish Project at University of Siegen (Germany),
we developed the free and open-source \FishSim Anima-
tion Toolchain" (FishSim) which combines easy creation,
animation and presentation of realistic 3D computer-
animated sh stimuli for the use in experiments with live
test sh (M uller et al. 2016, doi: 10.1093/cz/zow106;
Gierszewski et al. 2016, doi: 10.1093/cz/zow108). Fish-
Sim was specically designed for behavioral experiments
using common one-choice and two-choice set-ups, as in
studies on visual signaling and mate choice. FishSim
provides various possibilities to experimentally manipu-
late morphology and behavior of any number of virtual
3D sh with presentation via monitors. Since FishSim
is based on a computer game engine, it oers a unique
way for animating 3D sh via real-time input from an
external video-game controller.
To introduce FishSim and to assist in the implementa-
tion of our toolchain, we would like to welcome you to
join a 3-day international workshop for behavioral biol-
ogists on \Discovering FishSim in 3 days - new software
for computer-animated 3D sh stimuli for innovative
research in animal behavior". The workshop will be
held at University of Siegen in Siegen, Germany, from
October 20-22, 2017, and is organized by Dipl.-Biol.
Stefanie Gierszewski (Institute of Biology, UniversityJuly 1, 2017 EvolDir 105
of Siegen), Prof. Dr. Klaudia Witte (Institute of Biol-
ogy, University of Siegen), Dipl.-Inform. Klaus M uller
(Institute of Real-Time Learning Systems, University
of Siegen) and BSc. Jan-Marco H utwohl (Institute of
Real-Time Learning Systems, University of Siegen).
The goal of this 3-day workshop is to provide detailed
information on the free and open-source FishSim Ba-
sic and its integrated tools FishCreator, FishSteering
and FishPlayer in both theory and practice. DOs and
DON'Ts for implementation of FishSim Basic in future
research are discussed. Working computers with all soft-
ware installed will be provided but it is also possible to
use personal laptops. Assistance and advice for working
with own data will be given.
Please visit our website https://-
virtualshproject.wixsite.com/shsim for more
information about the software, the preliminary
program and the application procedure.
We hope to welcome you in Siegen!

1. Course content
This course aims at detailed understanding and hands-
on experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one\s own biological research questions. An
important aspect of the course is to show how genomic
data can be applied to address and answer research
questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, population
biology, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The
students will be trained in the latest bioinformatic meth-
ods to analyze high throughput sequencing data, which
is present in many research projects. The course will
cover basic computing tools required to run command
line applications, processing high throughput sequencing
data of whole genome / exome / restriction site digested
(RAD) DNA for population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general computing
tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line envi-
ronment, bash commands, data formatting using regular
expressions and basic scripting in the unix shell with a
series of examples and exercises using a remote server.
The course introduces bioinformatics software for analy-
sis of RAD-data, and downstream population genetic
analysis of genotype data. The course also introduces
basic and advanced concepts of population genomics
data analysis such as genome/transcriptome assembly,
alignment/mapping, dierential Gene expression, func-
tional enrichment tests, SNP genotyping, PCA, outlier
tests. The course corresponds to 1 week of full time
studies and and is composed of lectures, demonstrations
and computer labs.July 1, 2017 EvolDir 107

Vienna ExperimentalEvolution
Nov6-10
The Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics is
now accepting applications for the course \Experimental
evolution: From theory to practice" at the University of
Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, November 6-10, 2017.
Experimental evolution is extensively used to address
questions of evolutionary biology by exposing evolv-
ing populations to dierent environmental conditions.
It oers the opportunity to replicate experiments and
test for convergent outcomes. With the recent drop in
DNA sequencing cost and the advance of sequencing
technologies, the combination of experimental evolution
with next generation sequencing of pools of individuals
(Evolve & Resequence) has become a state-of-the-art
method to link phenotypic responses to genetic changes.
Although the availability of replicated time series data
is one key advantage of E&R, the analysis of such data
sets is still in its infancy. This course will introduce the
participants to several new approaches for the analysis
of genomic time series data covering the latest software
tools as well as required statistical and computational
skills.110 EvolDir July 1, 2017
The course is targeted towards researchers interested
in experimental evolution combined with NGS and will
cover the design of experimental evolution studies as
well as the analysis of Pool-Seq time series data.
The course aims to introduce participants to:
State-of-the-art software packages Modeling of neutral
data Identifying selected regions Comparison of n-point
analysis with time series data Inferring linkage structure
of Pool-Seq data Estimating selection coecients Call-
ing transposable elements in time series data Inferring
selection in transcriptomics data
Morning lectures by internationally renowned faculty
will be followed by computer practicals on the analysis
of experimental evolution data in the afternoon.
Faculty:
Jerey E. Barrick (The University of Texas at Austin,
US) Anthony M. Dean (University of Minnesota, US)
Tadeusz J. Kawecki (University of Lausanne, CH)Christian Schlotterer (Vetmeduni Vienna, A) Marina
Telonis-Scott (Monash University, AUS) Olivier Tenail-
lon (French Institute for Medical Research, FR) Hen-
rique Teotonio (IBENS, FR)
The course is free but will be restricted to a maximum
of 15 participants for the practical sessions (hands on
computer lab). Additional seats will be available for
attending the lectures, only. Students and researchers
are invited to apply by submitting a single .pdf le con-
taining 1) a short CV, 2) a motivation letter and a state-
ment of computer skills to popgen.vienna@gmail.com
by August 15, 2017. Condence in working with Unix
command line as well as in R, is strongly recommended
for the practicals. Participants are expected to arrange
their own accommodation.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.July 1, 2017 EvolDir 111
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
