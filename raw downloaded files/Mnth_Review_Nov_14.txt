8th International Macrostomum Meeting: Evolution
and Development in the free-living atworm genus
Macrostomum
We are happy to announce that we will hold the \8th
International Macrostomum Meeting" (8th IMM) here
in Basel. The meeting will last from the evening of
Friday, 28.11.2014 at 18:00 to the evening of Sunday,
30.11.2014 at around 16:00.
With the \First International Macrostomum Meeting",
which took place in 2007, also in Basel, we have started
a tradition of bringing together annually the growing
community of researchers that are either using at-
worms of the genus Macrostomum in their research or
who are otherwise interested in research on this inter-
esting model organism.
The topics of contributed talks and posters will likely
span Aging, Development, Genomics, Genome Editing,
Transcriptomics, Transgenesis, Regeneration, Neurobi-
ology, Ecotoxicology, Systematics, Phylogenetics, andSexual Selection. It is a great opportunity to get an up-
date on what is happening in the Macrostomum Com-
munity, and to establish personal contacts if you con-
sider to start working on these lovely worms.
As before, we want to keep things very simple and we
expect everyone to be prepared to cover their own costs.
In addition, we will, during the meeting, collect a small
fee to cover sandwich lunches, refreshments and a joint
dinner on Saturday evening (60 Euros in total). For
students we will try to nd oor space accommodation
in the apartments of people in our group (just bring
along a mat and a sleeping bag). Please let us know
if you would like to be accommodated in this way (see
the form below). We'll do what we can.
The other people should make a hotel reservation soon,
because there are many fairs in Basel, and hotels can
ll up quickly. We suggest that you book your room in
the Hotel Rochat, where we routinely host guests that
visit our department (http://www.hotelrochat.ch), and
where we therefore have special rates. These rates are
125.- CHF for single rooms and 180.- CHF for double
rooms. They also have 3- and 4-bed rooms for 210.-,
and 240.- CHF, respectively, if you want to share costs.
The Hotel Rochat is just ve minutes by foot from the
Institute. Please contact them directly to make your ar-
rangements/payments, and mention the Zoological In-November 1, 2014 EvolDir 3
stitute when you book to get the special rates.
For people coming by plane, please note
that Easyjet (http://www.easyjet.com), Swiss
(http://www.swiss.com), and AirBerlin (http://-
www.airberlin.com/) are ying to Basel from many
European destinations.
If you would like to attend the meeting (and present a
poster or talk) please ll out and return the form below
to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch until 5. November at the
latest.
Hopefully see you soon in Basel,

ganisms, biodiversity & phylogenomics, community &
ecosystem genomics, genetic and ecological networks,
methods & non-model organisms, genomics & animal
behavior, and applications of ecological and evolution-
ary genomics, will highlight how biodiversity can be
used to illuminate complex biological relationships and
inform ecological and evolutionary processes and molec-ular mechanisms of adaptation to changing environ-
ments. The conference will also feature emerging ap-
proaches and technologies to aid further exploration of
the genomes from organisms that span the tree of life.
Gordon Conferences are famous for fostering in depth
interactions that yield new insights in a collegial atmo-
sphere.

Dear all,
We are happy to announce a Theo Murphy discus-
sion meeting entitled, \Elements, genomes and ecosys-
tems: cascading nitrogen and phosphorus impacts
across levels of biological organization" funded by
the Royal Society of London to be held in Buck-
inghamshire, U.K. June 1-2 2015. The meeting
is open to everyone, but space is limited. Please
visit the following website to request an invita-
tion to register:https://royalsociety.org/events/2015/-
06/elements-genomes-ecosystems/ . This meeting will
explore how environmental nitrogen (N) and phospho-
rus (P) impact the evolution and use of nucleic acids
and how these eects, in turn, cascade through natu-
ral and agricultural ecosystems. It unites expertise in
N and P metabolism, plant and animal genome evolu-
tion, ecology (including those interested in biodiversity
and ecosystem functioning), and agriculture.
The reason for this early message is to advertise funds
from the U.S. National Science Foundation to help sup-
port the travel expenses of U.S. graduate students and
postdocs. Applicants from underrepresented groups are
specically encouraged to apply. We will begin review
of applications on December 15th 2014 to identify suit-
able candidates for receiving these limited awards.
Please go here for information on applying:

us with questions, and kindly forward to suitable
candidates.

Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre, Natural History Mu-
seum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists' Forum represents an
exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors
and other established systematists are also encouraged
to attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Again the YSF will be held the day after the
Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm ) also at the NHM, so that you
can attned both meetings. If you are attending both
you will need to register for each meeting separately.
Since talk slots are limited, we ask that you register
for a talk in one meeting and poster in the other, so
everyone gets time in the limelight!
Registration is FREE.

GETTING THERE: Address: Jardin des Plantes 36,
rue Georoy Saint Hilaire 75005 Paris - Bus: Lines 24,
57, 61, 63, 67, 89 et 91 - Metro, RER: M5: Auster-
litz, M7: Censier Daubenton, M10: Jussieu or Auster-
litz, RER C: Austerlitz. - SNCF Railway Stations:
Austerlitz or Gare de Lyon (but all the railway sta-
tions are connected to metro and bus lines) - Getting
to Paris by plane: Paris has two major international
airports: RoissyCharles de Gaulle (north of Paris) and
Orly (south of Paris). There is frequent connecting city
trains (RER) or buses leading to the center of Paris
(and therefore connection to the metro). The transfer
takes between 30 and 45 minutes.
*For those interested in taking advantage of their stay
in Paris to access the collections* The Mus eum national
d'Histoire naturelle stands as a fantastic memory of life
forms and minerals, holding one of the most important
international reference collections. Inert objects dis-
playing palaeontology, geology, mineralogy, meteorites,
botany, zoology, prehistory, anthropology, ethnobiol-
ogy and chemistry are estimated to total over 60 mil-
lion specimens. Visits to our collections are welcomed,
but access is dependent on the availability of curatorial
sta. Delegates are strongly encouraged to contact the
curators well in advance of the meeting through

ala Beckman Center of the National Academies, Irvine,
CA
*Evolutionary studies of clonal organisms have ad-
vanced considerably in recent years, but are still
edgling. Although recent textbooks on evolution and
genetics might give the impression that nonsexual re-
production is an anomaly in the living world, clon-
ality is the rule rather than the exception in many
viruses, bacteria, and parasites that undergo prepon-
derant asexual evolution in nature. Clonality is thus of
crucial importance in basic biology as well as in studies
dealing with transmissible diseases.
This Colloquium will bring together specialists in vari-
ous disciplines, including genetics, evolution, statistics,
bioinformatics, and medicine. A balance will be sought
between the various disciplines, including clonal ani-
mals and plants, animal and human cloning, pathogens,
and cancer studies.

BostonU EvoDevo
The Warkentin Lab at Boston University seeks appli-
cations for a PhD student to work on our NSF-funded
project, 'The Development of Adaptive Embryo Behav-
ior.'
Project Overview
When to hatch is an essential decision embryos make,
based on environmental cues. Hatching is also a phys-
ical feat that embryos perform. The ability to assess
cues, exit the egg, and survive outside the egg all change
as embryos develop. Thus, under the same external
conditions, both what embryos can do and what they
should do to survive change developmentally. The over-
all project examines the development and regulation
of environmentally cued hatching in red-eyed treefrogs,
/Agalychnis callidryas/. These embryos hatch up to
40% prematurely to escape from threats to the egg,
using cues in at least two sensory modalities, and mul-
tiple selective trade-os shaping hatching timing are
known. The project integrates work on hatching mech-
anisms and performance, sensory system development,
and hatching decision rules for responses to simple hy-
poxia cues and complex mechanosensory cues, to ex-
amine why and how development changes behavior. It
will improve our understanding of embryo lives, behav-
ioral development, and how animals use dierent kinds
of information to make decisions.Position Description
The student will participate in multiple aspects of the
project and be mentored to develop a dissertation that
builds on some component of the project and extends
to address independent questions. The student will be
based in the Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution group at
BU, conduct eld research at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Gamboa, Panama and, depending
on specic interests, may be co-mentored by mechanical
engineer Greg McDaniel.

Masters Graduate Assistantships in Ecology and Evo-
lution at the College of William and Mary
The Biology Department at the College of William and
Mary is recruiting new research Masters students in
ecology and evolution to start in Fall 2015. Full assis-
tantships are provided to nearly all students.We oer a two-year research-intensive Masters program
where students are supported by teaching assistantships
and full tuition waivers. For many students, getting
a Masters in two years and writing publications and
grants is the ideal preparation for applying to highly
competitive Ph.D. programs or jobs. We have a great
track record of our recent MS students going on to ex-
cellent PhD programs and professional positions. With
a low student-to-faculty ratio (approximately 10 new
students each year with 23 full-time faculty) we can of-
fer an intimate and highly personalized research and
education experience.
Importantly, we have real strengths in many aspects
of ecology and evolution. We are one of the few
smaller universities that have many evolutionary biol-
ogists and ecologists on their faculty, including: John
Swaddle (sexual selection/behavioral ecology), Martha
Case (plant systematics/pollination ecology), Jon Allen
(evolution and development), Joshua Puzey (evolu-
tionary genomics), Helen Murphy (evolutionary genet-
ics/experimental evolution), Drew LaMar (mathemat-
ical modeling), Paul Heideman (physiological evolu-
tion), Dan Cristol (behavioral ecology/ecotoxicology),
Harmony Dalgleish (forest ecology), Laurie Sanderson
(functional ecology), Randy Chambers (wetlands ecol-
ogy), Kurt Williamson (viral ecology), and Matthias
Leu (conservation/landscape ecology). The proximity
of William and Mary to county, state, and federal parks
as well as the Chesapeake Bay allows for extensive eld
research opportunities.

GhentU AvianBiodiversity
The Department of Biology at Ghent University is seek-
ing to ll a full-time PhD position vacancy (m/f) on
Avian Foodweb Ecology in Fragmented Landscapes
Background
While habitat fragmentation is increasingly recognized
as one of the prime drivers underlying the current global
biodiversity crisis, changes in foodweb dynamics result-
ing from habitat fragmentation have so far received
scant attention in functional biodiversity studies. By
applying state-of-the-art tools from ecological, forestry
and epidemiological research disciplines within a unique
plot design, biologists, bio-engineers and wildlife vets ofNovember 1, 2014 EvolDir 19
Ghent University aim to ll this gap by scaling up func-
tional biodiversity research from a classical plot to a
landscape level, and from producer dynamics to preda-
tor tness. The research consortium that conducts this
ambitious, 6 year research program will host 6 PhD stu-
dents, each focusing on particular components of the
terrestrial food web.
Project
This PhD project focuses on how tree diversity and the
spatial conguration of broad-leaved forest fragments
aect the ecology, health and performance of a sec-
ondary avian predator (great tit, Parus major), and
how this shapes its predatory impact on arthropod pop-
ulations (herbivore control). Higher nutritional quality
in more diverse forests is thereby predicted to improve
health by facilitating a better development of avian im-
munity and thereby reducing disease susceptibility. A
highly fragmented habitat, in turn, is predicted to re-
duce health through an increase in the use of anthro-
pogenic (lower quality) food and pathogen exposure at
forest boundaries, owing to increased contact with hu-
man habitation. The successful applicant will imple-
ment a variety of eld-, aviary- and lab-tools, and will
work closely together with other PhD students, eld
assistants and postdocs.
Prole
You hold a Master degree in Biology or an equivalent
Life Sciences degree, with a strong background in pop-
ulation and community ecology.
You are an enthusiastic and motivated student who can
deal with long hours in the eld, aviary and lab.
You have excellent organizational, writing and presen-
tation skills and are capable of working both indepen-
dently and within a multidisciplinary team.
Prior experience with ornithology and/or foodweb ecol-
ogy is highly recommended but not restrictive.
Oer

Jan and 1 Feb 2015) with a three-year extension after
positive evaluation.

EvolutionaryImmunogenomics
The newly established Research Group Evolutionary
Immunogenomics in the Department of Evolutionary
Ecology at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on/Germany has an opening for a
PhD student
Our research explores the evolution of immunogenetic
and genomic variability and its implications for individ-
ual immunocompetence and ultimately tness. We are
mainly focusing on data from human populations, us-
ing a wide spectrum of approaches from molecular biol-
ogy and high-throughput sequencing to computational
analyses and theoretical modeling, but also employ ex-
perimental model systems (stickleback, mouse) to test
predictions in the lab. Our scientic motivation ranges
from pure curiosity about evolutionary processes to the
desire to push the practical boundaries of Evolutionary
and Personalized Medicine. Specic projects within the
scheme of the lab are exible and can be tailored to
skills and interest of the successful candidate.
The group is part of the Max Planck Institute for Evo-
lutionary Biology with its vibrant and collaborative re-
search community of experimental, computational, and
theoretical labs that all share a common interested in
Evolutionary Biology. Cutting edge infrastructure is
available at all levels, including high-performance com-
puter clusters, a next-gen sequencing core facility, as
well as molecular and experimental labs with substan-
tial sh and mouse rearing facilities. The institute also
maintains strong ties to Kiel University with large com-
munities in evolutionary biology and medical genetics.
Furthermore, our lab is currently collaborating on a
number of projects with groups at Harvard Medical
School in Boston and the University of Texas in Austin.
Working language at the institute is English.
This position requires a Master's/Diplom degree in Bi-
ology, Bioinformatics, Genetics or a related eld. The
ideal candidate is fascinated by evolutionary questions
and eager to learn and master new skills and tools.
The duration and funding of a PhD project in the Ger-
man university system is generally aimed at three years.PhD candidates at the institute have the opportunity
to become member of the International Max Planck Re-
search School for Evolutionary Biology in collaboration
with the University of Kiel.
The PhD fellowship is funded for three years, extension
possible. The starting date is exible and can be imme-
diate. The fellowship includes support for health insur-
ance and family (if applicable), and housing and living
in this area is aordable. The Max Planck Society is
committed to employing more handicapped individuals
and especially encourages them to apply. The Society
also seeks to increase the number of women in those
areas where they are underrepresented and therefore
explicitly encourages female candidates to apply. The
institute is located in Pl on, northern Germany, in close
proximity to the university cities of Kiel and L ubeck
and not far from Hamburg, the second-largest city in
Germany. Frequent train connections allow for an easy
commute between Pl on and Kiel/L ubeck (each 30 min)
and provide general access to the well-developed Euro-
pean train network. Ploen is surrounded by a beautiful
landscape with many lakes and provides ample oppor-
tunity for water sports and other outdoor activities.
To apply, please send a cover letter with your motiva-
tion/interests and research experience (1 page max),
CV, and contact info of 2-3 references in one PDF

Ornithology, Seewiesen, Germany
When people are not fully understood, they persist with
attempts to communicate, in order to better convey

ravens (Corvus Corax) would use analogous commu-
nicative strategies in signaling, and whether they could
distinguish dierent degrees of misunderstanding.
Terms of appointment and qualications: - The project
should start in March 2015 and will last for 4-5 months
- Experience in behavioural biology would be benecial
- Because of the rather remote location of our institute,
a private car would be recommended
We seek a highly motivated person with organizational
skills, able and willing to work independently. You will
learn to interact with eight hand-raised ravens, to set
up the observation schedule, lm the behaviour and
experiments, design and develop a coding scheme and
analyze the behavioural interactions.
We oer the opportunity to work at one of the lead-

EvolutionElectricOrgans
Many studies have elucidated the genetic and devel-
opmental processes underlying major vertebrate traits
(ns, limbs, etc) in extant lineages. Most of these traits
have evolved only once, limiting insights into the degree
of constraint and repeatability of the evolutionary pro-
cesses. In contrast with most other vertebrate traits,
there have been six independent origins of electrogen-
esis, the ability to generate electric discharges from an
electric organ, within shes. Despite their clear benet
as a model for understanding general principles of par-
allel evolution of complex vertebrate tissues, we knowlittle about the molecular and developmental processes
underlying this tissue. In every group that has evolved
electrogenesis, electric organs originate during devel-
opment from skeletal muscle. The long-term goal of
the Electric Fish Laboratory at Michigan State (http:/-
/esh.zoology.msu.edu) laboratories is to characterize
the evolutionary steps that have occurred to modify the
developmental program in skeletal muscle to give rise
to the electric organ. A recent study (Gallant et al.
2014, Science) identied suites of genes in four species,
representing three independent origins of electrogene-
sis, which appear to be critical n the evolution of elec-
tric organs. Using cutting edge techniques in evolution
and development (including transgenics, genomics and
molecular biology), we plan to test hypotheses concern-
ing the roles of these genes in the evolution of electric
organs.
Ideal candidates for this position are high achieving,
creative, and independent. Training will combine cut-
ting edge techniques in genomics, bioinformatics molec-
ular biology and animal behavior. Michigan State Uni-
versity (MSU) is a world-class research university, pro-
viding world-class computing and genomics resources.
Set in the college town of East Lansing, the area fea-
tures a low cost of living as well as ideal surroundings
for nature lovers and sports fanatics alike. Prospective
applicants can be supported through several interde-
partmental graduate programs, including a top-ranked
program in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Behav-
ior (http://eebb.msu.edu), as well as genetics (http://-
genetics.msu.edu). Students will be encouraged to par-
ticipate in a one-of-a-kind NSF-sponsored BEACON
center for the study of evolution in action (http://-
beacon-center.org), for which MSU is the host institu-
tion. Successful candidates will be supported through
a combination of research assistantships and teaching
assistantships, and highly qualied may be eligible for
additional support through competitive fellowships at
the University level.
Applications to MSU either graduate program in
Biomolecular Science or Zoology is due December 1st,
2014. Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to
send inquiries in advance of this deadline to Dr. Jason

The relative contribution of divergent natural selection
and sexual selection on communication signals in the
evolution of reproductive isolation is a central ques-
tion in biology. ^A Progress is limited by poor knowl-
edge of how divergent communication signals origi-
nate at the genetic, cellular, and morphological lev-
els, as well as diculty connecting population level
processes prior to speciation with the macroevolution-
ary patterns of diversity observed after speciation is
completed. ^A The more than 200 nominal species of
mormyrids are ideally suited for circumventing such
problems, producing easily measured and quantied
electric discharge signals (EODs), which have a dis-
crete anatomical and physiological basis. ^A EOD sig-
nals are typically species-specic and have been demon-
strated to be a necessary component of courtship be-
havior, particularly for a rapidly evolved \species ock"
of mormyrids in the genus Paramormyrops. ^A The
Electric Fish Lab at Michigan State University (http:/-

these macroevolutionary patterns of electric signal di-
versity to population-level processes. ^A We have identi-
ed a key species to use newly developed techniques in
evolutionary genomics to identify genes responsible for
macroevolutionary patterns of electric signal diversity,
critical in the speciation process.

in East Africa and to relate species traits and habitat
characteristics to invasions in East African biodiversity
hotspots. The PhD candidate will determine the in-
cidence and extent of hybridization between Prosopis
species in various East African countries, assess geno-
type X environment interactions in these areas, assess
how genotypic identity and/or incidence of hybridiza-
tion links with habitat suitability, map Prosopis in-
vasions in East African forest reserves to determine
the eects of reserve isolation, proximity to propagule
sources, and edge eects on invasion extent.
The student will be based at Stellenbosch University
(http://www.sun.ac.za/Home.aspx) but will spent sub-
stantial periods of time in East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya,
Tanzania) to conduct eld research and interact with
other consortium members at various host institutions.
The project is suitable for students interested in envi-
ronmental management, GIS, and population ecology,
population genetics and/or evolutionary biology. Ap-
plicants should hold an MSc degree in one or more of the
following elds: Ecology, Botany, Evolutionary biology
or Population genetics. Preference will be given to indi-
viduals with demonstrated skills in one or more of these
elds and an excellent academic track record (grades,
publications in international journals, etc.). Success-
ful candidates will be fully funded for 3.5 years, forfull time research, with no teaching requirements. An
attractive annual stipend will be oered, along with ad-
ditional expenses for research, international travel and
subsistence and conference attendance. Individuals of

StockholmU LifeHistoryVariation
PhD student position in Ethology at the Department of
Zoology. Reference number SU FV-2909-14. Deadline
for applications: November 20, 2014.
Project description We are seeking a highly motivated
PhD student with an interest in evolutionary biology
and behavioral ecology to take part in the research
project \Life-history variation, behavior and methyla-
tion patterns", funded by the Swedish Research Coun-
cil. The aim of the project is to investigate the asso-
ciation between methylation patterns and variation in
life-history traits and behavior across species. Methy-
lation is one of several epigenetic inheritance mecha-
nisms, which may play an important role in phenotypic
plasticity and genetic accommodation. Understanding
epigenetic eects has implications for core evolutionary
processes such as heritability, maintenance of genetic
variation and speciation. Still, we have only a rudi-
mentary understanding of how evolutionary processes
are aected by these epigenetic eects. The project
involves a combination of modern phylogenetic com-
parative methods and experimental approaches to an-
alyze the association between methylation and inter-
specic variation in life-history and behavior using kil-
lish (Cyprinodontiformes) as a model system. The
selected candidate will gain experience in modern phy-
logenetic comparative methods, experimental design,28 EvolDir November 1, 2014
molecular analyses and statistics. This is an ambitious
project which will be demanding and require excellent
organization and analytical skills. However, we think it
will also be very rewarding and exciting.
The candidate will be based in Stockholm, the capital
of Sweden and a beautiful and vibrant Scandinavian
city. Since one of the PIs of the project has a joint
aliation between Stockholm University and the Uni-
versidad Nacional Aut onoma de M exico, research visits
to the later, in Mexico City, another vibrant and di-
verse city with plenty of cultural oer, are also highly
likely.
The proposed project combines the dierent areas of
expertise of the two principal investigators, who will
jointly supervise the candidate. Alejandro Gonzalez
Voyer is interested in phenotypic evolution and speci-
ation, topics that are mainly addressed using modern
phylogenetic comparative methods. Bj orn Rogell has a
broad interested in environmental stress, local adapta-
tion and phenotypic plasticity.
Qualications To be qualied for research studies in
ethology the applicant must have completed a research
degree (e.g. Master's), or have passed at least 120 hp
(2 years) of biological studies, including an approved
independent project of at least 30 hp at advanced level
(\examensarbete") within ethology, evolutionary biol-
ogy or related subjects. Applicants who have in princi-
ple acquired the corresponding competence in Sweden
or abroad are also qualied.
Criteria for selection Among qualied applicants, selec-
tion is made according to the ability to benet from
the studies. The criteria to be used are properly docu-
mented competence within the described research area,
capabilities with regards to speaking and writing in En-
glish (note that English is the working language in the
groups), analytical thinking, organizational skills, cre-
ativity, initiative, independence, and team work perfor-
mance. Experience with statistical analysis and molec-
ular data is an advantage. The applicant's earlier ex-
perience within the eld of research can be of rele-
vance especially when further documented by univer-
sity courses, independent research works, personal ref-
erences, interview and an application indicating the ap-
plicant's motivations in written form.
Terms of employment The PhD studies include 48
months of full-time studies with employment as PhD
student. The salary currently starts at 23.700
SEK/month.

StockholmU PlantInteractions
PhD position at the University of Stockholm (Depart-
ment of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences)
Topic: The ecology and evolution of plant-microbe-
insect interactionsDeadline for applications: November 20, 2014.
Project description
Plant-based food webs are well-known for their stun-
ning species diversity and complexity. For example,
several million insect species and a similarly large num-
ber of fungi, bacteria, nematodes and viruses interact
with the world's c. 300,000 plant species. Unfortu-
nately, studies on terrestrial food webs are often ham-
pered by the lack of interdisciplinary approaches. For
example, while we know that insects interact with in-
sects, and microbes with microbes, cross-kingdom inter-
actions among plants, insects and microbes have only
infrequently been explored. Nevertheless, recent evi-
dence indicates that plant-microbe-insect interactions
may be one of the major forces structuring the ecology
and evolution of terrestrial plant-based communities.
In this project, the PhD student can pursue multiple
approaches (depending on skills and interest) to in-
vestigate the role of plant-microbe-insect interactions
in structuring plant-based communities. The student
will start the project by using eld observations and a
large greenhouse experiment to quantify the relevance
of plant-microbe-insect interactions within a commu-
nity context. Depending on the interest of the student,
the next step may be to take a molecular approach to re-
veal the genetic and physiological mechanisms underly-
ing plant-mediated insect-microbe interactions, or delve
more deeply into community interactions under eld
conditions. Questions can be answered using the well-
characterized food web surrounding Plantago lanceo-
lata or the species-rich food web on the pedunculate
oak Quercus robur.

Sydney MolecularEvolution
3 PhD opportunities available in the Molecular Evolu-
tion Lab at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia for
a start from mid to late 2015.
Open to all nationalities. Closing date: December 15th
2014 More information: www.robertlanfear.com/join
Project 1: The ecology and evolution of somatic muta-
tion in plants
Somatic mutations (mutations in the body tissues) are
fundamentally important in the ecology and evolution
of plants, and they have huge implications for agricul-
ture and plant industry. Surprisingly though, very little
is known about them. This project will use cutting-edge
sequencing and bioinformatic approaches to gain some
of the rst insights into the causes and consequences of
somatic mutation in plants. The work will be carried
out on an experimental population of eucalyptus trees
planted in the beautiful Australian alps.
The research involves sequencing and comparing
genomes to reconstruct the history of somatic muta-
tions within individual plants. These histories will then
be used to test hypotheses about the causes and conse-
quences of somatic mutation within and between plants.
The work will illuminate many fascinating and under-
explored areas of biology, and there is great scope for
students to develop the research in line with their in-
terests.
Project 2: Molecular evolution and macroevolution in
acacias
Why do some species evolve faster than others? Do
rates of molecular evolution drive rates of speciation?
Are rates of morphological and molecular evolution
linked? This project will answer these and many other
questions using acacias, one of the most iconic and
species-rich plant groups in Australia, as a model sys-
tem.
The research will combine sequencing, phylogenetics,November 1, 2014 EvolDir 31
comparative analyses, and experimental work to gain a
rich understanding of macro- and molecular evolution
across the acacias. The initial focus will be on test-
ing key hypotheses about the causes and consequences
of molecular evolution, but following this there will be
great scope for students to develop the research in line
with their interests.
Prospective applicants should ideally have an MSc in
a related discipline (with a 50% research component),
and additional relevant research experience and/or
qualications. For project 1, experience with scripting
in Python and/or R, and the analysis of large short-
read sequencing datasets would be a bonus. If you
don't have these skills, a willingness to learn them is
absolutely essential.
The 2014 MQRES full-time stipend rate is $25,392 pa
tax exempt for 3 years. This can be supplemented by
teaching and demonstrating.
Applications should include 1) your CV, 2) a brief state-
ment of your reasons for applying (max. 500 words)
and the project you are applying to work on, 3) contact
details of two academic referees, 4) nationality. Appli-
cations should be submitted electronically as a single
PDF le.

PhD: Biochemical and biophysical mechanisms under-
lying evolutionary change.
Job description
Cells are highly organized through complex gene reg-
ulatory and protein networks for faithful and precise
function. These networks also need to be robust to
genetic perturbations to buer mutations that cells in-
evitably acquire during their lifecycle. Nevertheless,
on long evolutionary timescales mutations are essential
to allow organisms to adapt. In our recent studies we
deleted nearly essential genes in budding yeast and sub-
sequently evolved those mutants for 1000 generations.
We found that those cells are remarkably adaptable.
Three mutations are enough to nearly fully recover cell
function; in this case, cell size and doubling time. This
project aims to dissect the molecular changes under-
lying this adaptation. How do these mutations alter
the biochemical/biophysical mechanism that comprise
the specic cell function? Which properties of the net-
work are maintained and which ones are lost? Can we
learn general lessons from this lab evolution that we can
apply to complex adaptation processes such as cancer
formation? You will use quantitative uorescence life
cell microscopy as well as FRET measurements to in-
vestigate those questions. The aim is to combine the
measurements with modelling, potentially in close col-
laboration with a theory group. Visit the lab website
for more information:
http://laanlab.tudelft.nl/index.html Requirements
Applicants should have a Master's degree in biology,
chemistry, physics, or a related eld, and enthusiasm

A PhD position is available in the laboratory of Erik
Dopman in the Department of Biology at Tufts Univer-
sity. Our research is a collaborative project with Rick
Harrison at Cornell University, and the successful ap-
plicant will be part of a larger team at both Cornell
and Tufts.
Our work focuses on the evolution of barriers to gene
exchange during speciation. We apply a combination
of comparative and experimental approaches using the
European corn borer moth as a model system. Corn
borers are a textbook example of incipient speciation, in
which one species splits into two through the evolution
of multiple forms of reproductive isolation. Of 12 po-
tential isolating barriers between corn borer \strains,"
seven signicantly reduce gene ow and ve are either
behavioral or ecological in nature. Current eorts are
to identify the molecular genetic basis for traits con-
tributing to reproductive isolation, to characterize the
evolutionary history of these traits, and to evaluate the
consequences of barrier loci on tness and gene ow in
nature.
We seek a creative and motivated graduate student to
work on speciation, adaptive evolution, or genome evo-
lution. Students must have the ability to work with oth-
ers and a sense of humor. Undergraduate coursework
in evolutionary biology is required, as is prior research
experience. Relevant and highly desirable experience
includes application of molecular genetic techniques or
computational analysis of gene or genome data.

DimensionsBiodiversity
Funded Ph.D positions are available for the fall of 2015
in the lab of Carolin Frank (acarolinfrank.com), Life
and Environmental Sciences, University of California
Merced. Research in the lab focuses on the evolution
and ecology of bacterial endophytes in natural ecosys-
tems.
The graduate students will work on a large NSF-funded
project to study the taxonomic, genetic and functional
biodiversity of a novel nitrogen xing symbiosis in the
above-ground tissues of high elevation pines. The re-
search focuses on limber pine, a species with a wide cli-
matic, elevational and geographic range. Limber pine
grows in the Rocky Mountains from Alberta to New
Mexico; in the Great Basin states of Nevada and Utah;
and in the Sierra Nevada in California. To under-
stand how endophyte diversity is shaped by the envi-
ronment and how it shapes the nitrogen cycle in sub-
alpine forests, we will examine the biodiversity of en-
dophytes in limber pine and co-occurring pine species
across the limber pine range. Like most bacteria, the
endophytes cannot be cultured in the lab. Therefore,
cutting-edge methods including DNA sequencing and
genome analysis will be integrated with established and
highly sensitive methods for detecting and visualizing
nitrogen xing activity inside limber pine tissue. The
project is a collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley Na-
tional Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab and the
Joint Genome Institute. Students will actively partici-
pate in this team science project while developing their
own line of research inquiry, using a variety of sequence-
based, single cell genomics- and eld-based approaches.

the members of MarECon is primarily aimed at under-
standing the ecological and evolutionary genomics of
pelagic marine organisms, in particular marine mam-
mals. Our primary research approach is to leverage
population genetics and genomics techniques to uncover
the processes that partition genetic variation within the
species that inhabit this comparatively open marine en-
vironment. This research is conducted with a global
network of collaborators who collect data and tissue
samples in the eld.November 1, 2014 EvolDir 39
Job description The research project is exible and the
successful candidate will have the choice to focus on
some ongoing projects in the lab. Most of these projects
include a major component of (genetic) data analyses
and bioinformatics, some include the production of ge-
nomic data in the lab (using Next Generation Sequenc-
ing Technologies, NGS), and on rare occasion eld sam-
pling trips.
Comparative genomics in marine mammals Our lab
is actively engaged in the production and analyses of
whole genomes from marine mammals using NGS tech-
nologies. The ultimate goal is to analyze the molecular
evolution of genes across the genome of the three ma-
rine lineages of mammals that came back to an aquatic
existence and identify candidate genomic regions that
could have been involved in this major transition. This
project will consist of primarily bioinformatic, popula-
tion genetic and genomic approaches.
Evolution of marine trophic networks Climate change
and human activities have deeply impacted the evolu-
tion and functioning of marine ecosystems. Using a
number of model systems, we are exploring how envi-
ronmental and human perturbations have actually im-
pacted various species at dierent trophic levels, and
further understand the link between them. To make
inferences about past and recent evolution of these
ecosystems, and make predictions about their future
evolution we will be combining ecological, historical and
population genetic modeling.
Statistical phylogeography, demographic history and
evolution in marine mammals Our lab has a long stand-
ing interest in understanding the factors and processes
involved in the partitioning of individuals and thus the
genetic variation within and among populations, eco-
types and subspecies. This is fundamental to under-
stand key evolutionary and ecological processes, such
as adaptation, behaviour, and speciation. This is also
crucial for many conservation issues. Therefore, our
approach is multidisciplinary and combines population
genetics/genomics, geo-statistical probabilistic model-
ing with ecological approaches such as (paleo-) habitat
modeling, feeding ecology, etc. Our research focuses
on various (pelagic) species, particularly for marine
mammals. For example, we are currently developing
projects on the demographic history and evolutionary
genomics of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)
and the comparative phylogeography of marine mam-
mals, among other projects.
Qualications We seek a bright and highly motivated
and enthusiastic person able to work both as part of
a team and independently. The ideal candidate would
have a master degree in ecology and evolutionary bi-ology, with good background in population genetics,
bioinformatics, genomics and computational biology.
Candidates from other programs such as computational
sciences, bioinformatics, and mathematics with a strong
interest in ecology and evolution are also invited to ap-
ply.
Prociency with R statistical language, Linux/UNIX
shell scripting, and (at least) a high level programming
language (e.g. Python) is recommended. Experience
with NGS technologies, Geographic Information Sys-
tem, SQL data bases is a plus, but full training will be
provided.
The language in the lab is English. A high standard of
spoken and written English is required.
Conditions of employment The University of Gronin-

Developing theory to predict the eects of climate
change on the fertility and reproduction of marine in-
vertebrates
Description:
Human activities are changing the Earth's climate and
the Earth's oceans. Air and water temperatures are in-
creasing, and the uptake of CO2 into seawater is causing
oceans to become more acidic. These changes are ex-
pected to be detrimental to marine invertebrates[1], a
diverse group of species (e.g., sea urchins, corals, clams)
that are often keystones in their ecosystems. Most
marine invertebrates release their sperm and eggs di-
rectly into the water, where gametes meet and fertil-
ization takes place. There is growing evidence that en-
vironmental change can impair gamete function and the
fertilization process. However, whether these climate-
mediated changes in marine invertebrate reproduction
will aect population persistence and ecosystem sta-
bility is dicult to intuit. Mathematical models are
urgently needed but do not exist.November 1, 2014 EvolDir 43
In this project, the student will combine mathemati-
cal and computational modelling with empirical test-
ing to understand how climate change aects marine
invertebrates and the ecosystems they support. With
guidance from Tucker Gilman and Richard Preziosi,
the student will develop advanced analytical models[2]
and individual-based simulations[2,3] of marine ecosys-
tems. With guidance from John Fitzpatrick and Ceri
Lewis, the student will test the model predictions in
vivo[1,4,5]. This work will take advantage of the Uni-
versity of Manchester's Computational Shared Facility
and of the University of Exeter's Aquatic Resource Cen-
tre. Students with backgrounds in life sciences, physics,
mathematics, or computer science would be well-suited
for this project.

1280683/96871?iso=no Job Description
The main objective of this PhD project is to investi-
gate strains of Yersinia pestis from dierent localitiesand periods of the second plague pandemic (14th-18th
c.). With ancient DNA analysis it has been demon-
strated that Y. pestis was the causative agent of all
known historic plague pandemics with distinct vari-
ants circulating simultaneously through Europe during
past outbreaks. Despite these ndings, several ques-
tions which concern the plague and the historic Y.
pestis strains remain open, theroutes of transmission
of plague, the mechanisms of dissemination and the
implication of wild and urban fauna. We have pro-
posed to investigate the evolutionary and ecological
processes behind the historic plague pandemics using
a multidisciplinary approach involving paleogenomics
with high-throughput sequencing methods. With this
approach, we aim to generate data on genetic diver-
sity among ancient strains and dene bacterial popu-
lation dynamics of the past. We also aim to under-
stand spatial and temporal trajectories of transmis-
sion by relating the genomic information to climatolog-
ical and ecological data. The successful candidate will
join the multi-disciplinary, international team of Med-
Plag (\MedPlag: The medieval plagues: ecology, trans-
mission modalities and routes of the infections", Ad-
vanced Grant funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (ERC)) that brings together experts from the elds
of ancient DNA, ecology, evolution, microbiology, ar-
chaeology and history (http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/-

should have a background within population genomics,
bioinformatics or ancient DNA. The candidate should
be able to document strong analytical skills and experi-
ence in the laboratory. Experience with ancient DNA,

UOslo SpeciationGenetics
Doctoral Research Fellowship in Speciation Genetics
A PhD position is available at the Department of Bio-
sciences (IBV), Faculty of Mathematics and Natural
Sciences, University of Oslo (UiO). The PhD project is
part of a larger research program on the 'Evolvability
of genomic architecture during hybrid speciation'.
Far from being an evolutionary dead end, hybridizationmay even generate lineages that can speciate even un-
der the most constraining of conditions. The Italian
sparrow (Passer italiae) is the rst documented case
of hybrid speciation in birds (Hermansen et al. 2011).
This hybrid species originated from past events of hy-
bridization between two divergent parental species, the
house sparrow (P. domesticus) and the Spanish sparrow
(P. hispaniolensis) some thousands of years ago. The
Italian sparrow is both phenotypically and genetically
variable across the Italian peninsula and its genome is
a composite mosaic of DNA from both parentspecies'
genomes. But little is known about the consequences of
such major genomic rearrangements on the evolution-
ary potential of hybrid species and how hybridization
in general may favor novel evolutionary trajectories.
This project integrates ecological and molecular ap-
proaches to develop an understanding of the evolution
of genomic architecture during hybridization events and
its evolutionary implications, using the Italian sparrow
as the model system. The successful candidate will be
allowed to choose aspects of the evolutionary genetics
and genomics of the larger study as best ts her/his
skills and research interests. She/he will also be encour-
aged to develop additional, complementary avenues of
research.
Interested candidates should have a Master degree or
equivalent in a relevant eld of biology, such as in ge-
netics, genomics and/or bioinformatics. Documented
knowledge in evolutionary biology is required. A good
command of English and laboratory experience is like-
wise required. In addition, a special interest in the eld
of speciation and previous eldwork or bird handling
experience would be advantageous.
The position is aliated with the Centre for Ecological
and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES), and research will
be conducted in close collaboration with Prof. Saetre
and his group at CEES. The research team will also in-
clude other scientists from Norway, the US and Switzer-
land. The working language will be English. Fieldwork
may be conducted at a variety of locations, including
Norway, Italy and other Mediterranean countries.
The appointment is for 3 years, but may be extended to
4 years conditional on 25% teaching obligations and ap-
proval from the Department of Biosciences. Candidates
interested in a 4-year position should state so, in which
case previous teaching experience would be considered
a merit.

A PhD fellowship in Paleobiology is available in the De-
partment of Earth and Environmental Science at the
University of Pennsylvania, starting in Fall 2015. Prof.
Lauren Sallan seeks a graduate student to address ma-
jor paleobiological questions, such as how global change
has aected life over time, how life evolves at high lev-
els (macroevolution), and the origins of living biodiver-
sity. Specic topics include, but are not limited to: the
drivers and ecological consequences of mass extinction
(e.g. the end-Devonian Hangenberg event), the role
of predation and competition in setting marine biodi-
versity, the characteristics of adaptive radiations and
'living fossils,' the eects of long-term environmental
events (e.g. the Late Paleozoic Ice Age) on biodiver-
sity trends, and transitions in early vertebrate evolu-
tion (e.g. origin of jaws, invasion of land). The student
can also develop a novel project that address similar
questions using quantitative, phylogenetic and descrip-
tive methods. While research in the lab has focused on
shes, any suitable group of fossil animals may be used.
Applicants are encouraged to contact Prof. Sallan (lsal-
lan@sas.upenn.edu) for more details. Additional infor-
mation on the fellowship is available on the depart-
mental website: www.sas.upenn.edu/earth. Applica-
tions for entry in Fall 2015 are due December 15, 2014.

MammalEcologyEvolution
I am currently advertising three graduate student open-
ings in my lab in the Department of Biology at the Uni-
versity of Saskatchewan (www.lanelab.ca). I envision
two of these as most appropriate for Ph.D. students and
one as most appropriate for an M.Sc. student. There
is some latitude for broadening or tightening the focus,
however, to accommodate alternatives. All will begin
in either May or September, 2015. I have full funding
for one of the Ph.D. positions. The other two positions
will be supported by departmental or university-level
teaching assistantships (competition for these funding
sources will be in spring 2015).
Graduate student funding at the UofS is quite com-
petitive so, for all positions, the successful applicant
will have a GPA >80% (converted to the UofS 1-100
scale) over the past two years of schooling and a de-
gree in a relevant discipline (i.e., Ecology, Evolution-
ary Biology, Physiology, Environmental Biology). Of
note, while I certainly appreciate the hard work that is
put into obtaining a degree in Biotechnology, I do not
view this as relevant experience for these positions. The
specic interests/experience of the successful candidate
will vary to some extent on the project applied for, but
in all cases, a passion for eldwork (in beautiful places),
strong scientic communication skills (both written and
oral) and statistical prociency (or a willingness to gain
it) is necessary.
If you are interested in applying for one of these po-
sitions, please submit a cv (including names and con-
tact details of references), a short (1 pg) description of
research interests and an unocial copy of your tran-
scripts to jerey.lane@usask.ca. Applications will be
accepted up to Jan 31, 2015, but will be evaluated as
theyre received. To ensure full consideration of your ap-
plication, therefore, please submit asap. Any questions
can be directed to Je Lane (email above).
Hibernation biology of Columbian ground squirrels
(Ph.D.) Columbian ground squirrels are resident in
the northwest Rocky Mountains and populations in
Kananaskis, Alberta have been studied since the early1990s. We have recently shown that, in contrast to the
overwhelming majority of reported phenological trends
in response to climate change, emergence dates from hi-
bernation in this population have been consistently de-
layed over the past two decades. This eect is likely due
to an increasing prevalence of late-spring snowstorms in
the area. This project will involve investigating addi-
tional phenological traits (e.g., entry into hibernation),
physiological changes during the active (e.g., energy ex-
penditure during reproduction) and hibernation season
(e.g., body temperature proles) and survival and re-
productive success of individuals. In all cases, datasets
collected over multiple years are available and can be
built upon, and multiple completely censused popula-
tions are available for study. This is an ideal opportu-
nity for a student to leverage a proven powerful study
system to address important fundamental and applied
research questions.

Reproductive phenology of North American red squir-
rels (Ph.D.) The Kluane Red Squirrel Project (KRSP)
was initiated in the late 1980s and now represents one
of the longest running and most-comprehensive studies
of a wild mammal in the world. Researchers from mul-
tiple universities are involved and exciting collabora-
tions have produced many important, interdisciplinary
ndings. A clear strength of this project stems from
our ability to quantify the primary food resource for
individual red squirrels (white spruce seed, cached as
cones). This project will involve investigation of phe-
nological variation of individual red squirrels and its
relationship to phenological variation in white spruce.
Quantitative genetics analyses will be used to estimate
heritabilities and genetic correlations (i.e., evolutionary
potential) in phenological traits and opportunities are
available to collaborate with other researchers in en-
ergetic physiology, population ecology, endocrinology
and animal behaviour. All eldwork will occur in the
spectacular southwest Yukon Territory at KRSPs eld

Contemporary evolution in response to environmental
variation in an island bird population
Understanding how natural selection operates in uc-
tuating environments is fundamental to understanding
evolution. Historically, it has been dicult to under-
stand how the environment impinges on the physio-
logical state of wild birds but the recent application
of telomere measurement techniques in natural popula-
tions now provides a window into this question. This
project will be one of the rst to combine physiological
state, demography (e.g. size, age structure and dynam-
ics) and selection in a wild population.
The student will utilise Sheelds unique long-term
study of a wild house sparrow population on Lundy Is-
land, providing access to an existing databank and sam-
ples covering more than 15 years. The programme of
work will explore the relationship between bird survival
and fecundity at dierent stages of the life-course, to-
gether with changes in physiological state (with telom-
ere length as a proxy), population demography and
other environmental variables. The heritability of these
relationships (reaction norms) will also be investigated
to determine if tness dierences are transmitted to fu-
ture generations. There is exibility in the programme
and the precise direction and emphasis of the project
will be determined by collaboration between the stu-
dent and the supervisors.
The student can expect to receive exceptional training
in state-of-the-art analytical methodology and labora-
tory techniques, including telomere analysis and DNA
proling, as well as benetting from a well established
and rewarding eld project.
The PhD project is fully funded with a starting date
between JanuaryVMarch 2015. Applicants, who must
be residents of the EU and must have a good (i.e.
minimum IIi grade) honours degree, a masters degree,
or equivalent, in a relevant subject, should completean on-line application form via the University admis-
sion system (www.shef.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/-
apply/applying) and should upload a supporting state-
ment explaining why they want to pursue this PhD
(maximum 1 page) followed by a short proposal ex-
plaining how they would approach the project, includ-
ing any specic hypotheses (maximum 2 pages includ-
ing any references). They should also upload their CV.
Any enquiries about the project should be directed to
Professor Terry Burke (t.a.burke@sheeld.ac.uk).
Applications for this project will be accepted until Mon-
day 3 November 2014.

USussex BacterialPopGenetics
A PhD position is available in the lab of Adam Eyre-
Walker at the University of Sussex to work on bacterial
population genetics.
The vast majority of organisms on this earth are
prokaryotes and they are responsible for many of the
biggest problems facing mankind, from diseases such as
tuberculosis and typhoid, to hospital infections, such
as those caused by methicilin resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). However, despite their prevalence and
importance we still have a poor understanding of bacte-
rial population genetics. We know the genome of many
bacteria is highly labile so that any two strains of a bac-
terial \species" share only some genes; this has led to
the concept of a core genome and an accessory genome.
However, the evolutionary forces that act upon both
genomes have not been extensively investigated. The
aim of this project is to rectify this and to look at
several aspects of bacterial population genetics in over
100 bacterial species for which multiple strains have
been completely sequenced. The project will involve
the bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data.
Students with a str ong background in evolutionary bi-
ology, genetics and/or bioinformatics are particularly
encouraged to apply.
The position is available to UK and EU residents only.
It is fully funded for 3.5 years; funding includes fees and
a stipend equivalent to the standard UK research coun-
cil rate (currently $13,863 per annum). The position
involves 50 hours of teaching a year.

The role of ancient developmental genes in trait di-
versication. Males of the genus Rheumatobates are
known to have highly modied appendages that aid in
the grasping of resistant females. The transition from
the ancestral to the derived states occurs multiple times
and in dierent ways, leading to a diversity of morpho-
logical outcomes (presence and location of antagonis-
tic hooks and spines etc). The remarkable diversity
in these antagonistic traits may be driven by two pro-
cesses ' a direct response to dierences in female resis-
tance to mating, and/or spatio-temporal variation in
the expression of developmental genes, where a variety
of outcomes are similarly eective. We have recently
uncovered the role of an ancient developmental gene,
dll, in controlling the sexually antagonistic modica-
tion of male grasping antennae in Rheumatobates rylei.
To determine the relative importance of these two al-
ternative processes in generating sexual diversity, we
are combining behavioural studies of antennal function
with studies examining the role of dll in the diversi-
cation of these structures, in Rhematobates spp. that
span the range of modied antennae. For more details
see references below.

Why reproduce sexually and what happens if you
don't? The Agrawal and Wright labs are engaged in
a series of projects exploring the evolutionary causes
and consequences of sexual reproduction in duckweed, a
fast-growing aquatic plant that produces both clonally
and via sexual reproduction. We have already obtained
a number of genomic resources for several duckweed
species and are using these data sets to infer historical
rates of sex and relate this to the eciency of past se-
lection genome-wide. Lab and eld studies are planned
to study the ecological sources of selection on sex as
well as to ground population genetics inferences.
We are excited about using a combination of approaches
to address one of the classic problems in evolutionary
biology! There are graduate opportunities involving
evolutionary genomics as well as lab and eld exper-
iments with duckweeds.

PhD position: The evolution of the supercolony and
the role of parasites
Investigating the evolution of cooperation is essential
to explaining the ecological dominance of many social
species. The highly successful social insects are of-
ten thought of as colonies residing in single internally-
cooperative nests. In reality, many ant species form
nests that connect cooperatively with neighbouring
nests, becoming 'unicolonial'. Explaining the evolu-
tion of unicolonial cooperation is challenging because
although conspecics in these extended colonies are be-November 1, 2014 EvolDir 53
having co-operatively, they also compete for resources.
Resource competition means that a unicolonial strategy
should be vulnerable to cheats who recognise closer kin
and cooperate selectively, securing resources for their
own near relatives, at the expense of the whole colony.
In the light of this potential instability, how does uni-
coloniality arise and persist? One possibility is that
parasitism drives co-occurrence of multiple queens for
increased genetic diversity, allowing colonies to split be-
tween connected nests. This studentship addresses the
current lack of theoretical models of the evolutionary
of unicoloniality and the absence of empirical data on
the eects of parasitism on unicoloniality.

We are looking to ll three PhD positions.
PhD position 1. In this PhD project, we will use tra-
ditional fermented foods from Zambia as experimen-
tal model systems to study microbial community dy-
namics and evolution. We aim to address fundamen-
tal questions relating to eco-system evolution both ex-
periments and modelling on the microbial ecology and
evolution of fermenting microbes. We will also relate
this to compositional and functional stability of the
community of fermenting microbes. This PhD position
will be part of a larger research programme on tradi-
tional fermented foods in Zambia. Candidate prole:
Masters in (evolutionary) biology, genetics, microbiol-
ogy, food (bio)technology or related eld. Proven ex-
perimental skills in microbiology and molecular tools.

to visit eld sites and to discuss with the other PhD
candidates in the programme. The candidate will sta-
tioned at Wageningen University at the Laboratory of
Genetics on the basis of the CAO Nederlandse Uni-
versiteiten for 4 years. www.academictransfer.com/-
24865 PhD positions 2 and 3. PhD candidates 1
and 2 will establish consumer preference and require-
ments and how taste, nutritional value, food stability
and food safety of the products are aected by produc-
tion procedures, fermentation processes and the ecol-
ogy the micro-organisms responsible for fermentation.
Phd candidate 2 will focus on Mabisi, PhD candidate
3 will focus on Munkoyo/Chibwantu. Candidate pro-
les: Masters degree in food science and technology,
microbiology or related eld. Willingness and ability
to perform eld as well as laboratory based research
and anity with conditions in rural Zambia. Willing-
ness and ability to spend 50% of time in Zambia (mostly
Lusaka) and 50% in Wageningen. Candidates will be
oered a contract for 4 years out of Wageningen Univer-
sity on the basis of Nuc guidelines (see www.nuc.nl)and will be stationed at Wageningen University (Food
Quality and Design and Food Microbiology), as well as
the University of Zambia (Department of Food Science
and Nutrition). Preference will be given to candidates
from Zambia and the Southern African region.
The 3 PhD candidates will be working with a multidis-
ciplary team of supervisors at Wageningen University:
Dr Sijmen Schoustra and prof Bas Zwaan (Evolution-
ary Biology and Genetics), Dr Anita Linnemann (Food
Quality and Design) and Prof. dr. Eddy Smid (Food

The Department of Soil and Crop Sciences (SCS) at
Colorado State University is recruiting for a tenure-
track Assistant/Associate Professor in the eld of Crop
Functional Genomics. We seek a dynamic, motivated
scientist to lead an innovative research program that
employs functional genomics approaches to discover
and characterize genes controlling traits that are im-
portant for crop production and utilization. The in-
tended focus of the position is in wheat, though op-
portunities exist for research in other areas and crops.
Candidates are sought with demonstrated capacity to
integrate modern whole-genome approaches and tech-
niques to further gene discovery and characterization
for agronomic, pest resistance, and crop utilization ob-
jectives. The successful candidate will advance Col-
orado State University's and SCS's land-grant mis-
sion and will contribute to programs of the College
of Agricultural Sciences (CAS) by conducting research
and teaching that is responsive to local or regional
production constraints, global food security, and the
rapidly expanding technological capacity in crop ge-
nomics. This tenure track position is a 60% research,
30% teaching, and 10% outreach appointment on a
9-month contract. Information regarding the depart-
ment, its programs, and degrees oered can be viewed
at http://soilcrop.agsci.colostate.edu.
The successful applicant will be expected to develop a
nationally and internationally recognized research pro-
gram using cutting-edge technologies in the arena of
crop functional genomics, specically to identify genes
and characterize the mechanisms by which genes aect
important agronomic, pest resistance, or end-use qual-ity traits. Potential research topics include, but are
not limited to, gene discovery and characterization via
TILLING or genome editing methods, comparative ge-
nomics, integration of functional genomics techniques
with other genotype to phenotype approaches (such
as QTL analysis and genome-wide association studies),
ne mapping and gene cloning, and plant transforma-
tion for validation of gene function. The successful can-
didate will teach an alternate-year undergraduate level
course in applications of plant biotechnology and an
alternate-year graduate level course in the candidate's
primary area of expertise.

tenured/tenure-track faculty positions at any rank, be-
ginning in fall 2015. We are searching for creative, col-
laborative thinkers who use integrative approaches toaddress fundamental ecological questions at regional to
global scales. Our ultimate goal is to enhance our ex-
pertise in geographical and aquatic ecology toward pre-
dicting ecological and evolutionary responses to global
change. The search is open to theoretical, lab, and eld
biologists working on any taxa. In this cluster hire, we
seek:
* A Geographical Ecologist who studies phenomena at
multiple spatial scales toward understanding large-scale
patterns and processes. Innovators in biogeography,
macroecology, bioinformatics, and global ecology are
especially encouraged to apply. * An Aquatic Ecolo-
gist who studies freshwater ecosystems toward predict-
ing the role of changing water supplies on ecosystem
services. Innovators in biogeochemistry, ecological net-
works, ecological genomics, river-reservoir systems and
land-water interactions are especially encouraged to ap-
ply. * A Physiological Ecologist who studies the origin
and maintenance of ecological traits and their ultimate
role in the dynamics of population and ecosystem re-
sponses to a changing environment. Innovators study-
ing traits involved in metabolic, stoichiometric, thermal
and water-related variation and adaptation are espe-
cially encouraged to apply.
We are especially interested in candidates who use or
combine some of the following three approaches in their
work. The rst is development and/or testing of mod-
els and theory that connect phenomena at scales from
local to global. The second is an integrative use of data-
from gene frequencies to biogeochemistry, species dis-
tributions to climate past and future, functional traits
to landscapes-to advance theory and identify novel pat-
terns and processes. The third is a desire to apply this
research to ameliorating outstanding ecological prob-
lems, including climate change, biodiversity loss, dwin-
dling water supplies, and the degradation of ecosystem
services.
The University of Oklahoma is committed to building
an international center of excellence exploring the geo-
graphical ecology of our evolving biosphere. Successful
candidates will join colleagues across campus, including
cluster hires in the EPSCoR initiative Adapting socio-

Paid Research Assistant Position (1 year)
What we are looking for: An extremely motivated
and independent biology student who joins the striped
mouse project for approximately one year from Decem-
ber 2014/Jan 2015 until the end of 2015 as a research as-
sistant. Research assistants get free accommodation at
the station, and R3500/month to cover their daily costs.
Travel costs will be refunded by a maximum of 100 Euro
/month based on the time spent at the research station.
This would also be an opportunity for 2 external mas-
ter students, who would only get part of their travel
costs refunded (100 Euro/month), but would have to
cover the daily costs of living themselves plus the costs
of accommodation of R1550/month. Master students
have to stay 6 months at the station, one for the rst
half and the other one the second half of 2015 (not si-
multaneously).
The job: Help in data collection for the project Eco-
Physiology of Cognition, where we study how environ-
mentally induced physiological change aects cognition.
Help in all general duties at the research station and in
general data collection for the long-term project http:/-
/stripedmouse.com . Project summary
As a consequence of global change, extreme environ-
mental events threaten biodiversity, bringing about the
6th extinction, with the increase of drought periods be-
ing one major challenge. Droughts induce physiologi-
cal mechanisms of fasting which might impair cognitive
performances of animals, such as reaction time and spa-
tial memory, both being important when having to re-spond to predators. Fasting is often associated with
a decrease in blood glucose levels and studies on hu-
mans indicate an inuence of blood glucose levels on
cognitive performance. The student will study African
striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in the eld in South
Africa at the Succulent Karoo Research Station. These
mice live in a semi-desert and have to survive the an-
nual dry season in summer, when their blood glucose
levels are signicantly lower than during the moist sea-
son in winter and spring. The student will perform
tests in both seasons and will test the hypothesis that
free living striped mice which received glucose water
for drinking at their nest during the dry season per-
form better than striped mice with lower blood glucose
levels. These experiments will be conducted with free
living striped mice during the dry season.
Dry season projects (Jan-May)
Field experiments on reaction time: The student will
measure reaction time during afternoon observations
using our developed \moving shadow test". A mini-
mum of 20 mice from several groups will be tested twice,
once under normal conditions, and another time after
they received glucose solution to drink to increase their
blood glucose levels. Water / sucrose solution will be
presented one hour before onset of experiments.
Field experiments on spatial orientation: A barrier will
be presented in the eld, giving the individual mouse
two escape routes, a long one and a shorter one. Mice
will be lured to a starting point with water as reward,
they will be startled, and it will be noted whether they
take the short or long escape route. A minimum of 20
mice from several groups will be tested with water as
reward, another 20 mice with sugar solution as reward.
Moist season projects (Jan-May): These data will be
compared with data collected by the postdoc Dr. A.
Maille during the dry season, who will train the stu-
dent in these procedures. Data will be collected using
the moving shadow test in the eld, and the orientation
response test and Barnes maze in the research room at
the eld station.
Permanent projects
Pilot studies with a captive colony: using a
captive colony of striped mice at the research
station and using modern touchscreen chambers
(http://www.phenosys.com/index.php/en/products/-
touchscreen-chamber), the student will test whether
two cognitive tests for reaction time and spatial
memory can be used with this equipment: the 2-choice
visual discrimination test and the 5-choice serial
reaction time test.
Long-term data base: The student will helps with theNovember 1, 2014 EvolDir 85
general eld work in the morning and during the after-
noon, contributing to trapping, marking, observing and
radio-tracking of striped mice. The student will assist
the research station manager in his work, learn research
management skills, and take over his duties when he is
on leave.
Work and life at the research station: The student also
has to help with the general duties at the research sta-

ogy at the University of Vermont. The focus of the lab's
research is on using high-throughout genotype and phe-
notype data to understand the evolutionary impacts of
changing environmental conditions on natural popula-
tions. Our research investigates the genetic architecture
of local adaptation, genotype-phenotype mapping, eco-
logical divergence in patterns of gene expression, and
genetic signatures of demographic history such as ef-
fective population size, structure, and landscape con-
nectivity. Our main study systems are forest trees and
invasive plants.
Duties and responsibilities: The technician must be
comfortable in both the lab and in the eld. Lab work
will focus primarily on generating population genomic
data for evolutionary analysis (e.g., high-throughput
genotyping and sequencing). The position will also
include eld work involving trait measurements and
maintenance of common garden experiments, as well
as travel for specimen collecting from natural popula-
tions. Additional responsibilities may include growth
and maintenance of plants in the greenhouse or growth
chambers, ordering of lab supplies, maintaining lab
equipment, ensuring lab safety standards, contributing108 EvolDir November 1, 2014
to manuscript preparation, and assisting undergradu-
ate students.
Qualications: A B.S. or B.A. in biology is required
by the time of appointment. Candidates should have
strong organizational skills, and be procient in stan-
dard molecular biology techniques such as DNA/RNA
extraction, electrophoresis, primer design, PCR, qRT-
PCR, DNA sequencing, genotyping, restriction di-
gests, etc. Desirable experience includes making next-
generation sequencing libraries (GBS or RAD-Seq,
RNA-Seq, WGS), and the ability to conduct occasional
eld work under diverse outdoor conditions, including
in mountainous, forested terrain.
Start date is exible, and could begin as soon as a suit-
able applicant is found. The position is full time and
comes with benets. Funding is available for an initial
period of two years, contingent on performance.

ChromosomePairing in
DiploidHybrids
Please can anyone quote me a published case of a
diploid hybrid that has some of its chromosomes homol-
ogous such that at meiosis they pair fully and regularly
while the rest are without partners.
Meiosis in Diploid Hybrids
David Harberd
In a recent (failed) attempt at publishing in a reputable
scientic journal I mentioned, correctly as I believe,
the comment that during meiosis in diploid hybrids EI-
THER all of the chromosomes are involved in bivalent
formation, each being paired with a homologue so that
every gene comes to lie alongside its allele from the
other parent OR there are no homologues in the com-
plement, all 'pairing' observed being random and casual
resulting in few, if any, of the genes lying alongside an
allele. I can still recall my own shock-horror/incredulity
when I realized that this was the inevitable conclusion
from the fact that I could trace no records to any cases
of diploid hybrids with both some chromosomes with
homologues and some without. My referees were obvi-
ously struck with the same incredibility and refused to
believe it - one going so far as to state that he knows
of several cases that refute it. I begged him to put me
out of my misery and to share his knowledge, but I got
no reply: I wonder why.
I do not make the claim lightly. I do have 70 years
of experience in the eld (I graduated 67 years ago).
Furthermore I do realize the appalling implications for
some treasured beliefs resulting from this seemingly
trivial comment. If it is correct then rstly it means
that chromosome pairing is controlled genomicly rather
than by the individual chromosomes themselves, all of
the chromosomes of one genome being tarred with the
same brush. Secondly, and much more critically, it
means that genomes did not arise gradually, chromo-
some by chromosome, in a Darwinian evolution: they
emerged abruptly, suddenly, all complete with a full set
of new chromosomes; from the outset they were both
fertile within their own bounds and isolated from all
previous genomes. Finally it means that the full forceof Darwinian Natural Selection does not come into play
until after the origin of genomes. All quite ridiculous
and impossible of course - but remember this: once and
not so very long ago (in my student days) it was sheer
madness to suggest that Africa and America could ever
have been contiguous and that they had drifted apart.
Impossible it might have been but nevertheless it has
come to pass - and this is not a unique change of heart
in the history of knowledge. Please can anyone quote
me a published case of a diploid hybrid that has some
of its chromosomes homologous such that at meiosis
they pair fully and regularly while the rest are without
partners.
Thank you, David Harberd

CallApplications
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2015 V Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) fromNovember 1, 2014 EvolDir 113
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. There-
fore, ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility
grants for young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Friday 16 January 2015, 12.00 GMT.
Eligibility:
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. The maximum single award will be
2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or
a period of research at a lab that you have not previ-
ously visited. There is no restriction on the country
of residence or nationality of the applicant but prefer-
ence will be given to applicants who are unlikely to be
able to fund the proposed work by other routes. Pref-
erence will also be given to self-contained or seed-corn
projects, rather than fundamental elements of already-
funded PhD or postdoctoral projects, and to projects
with a denable output that is achievable within the
scope of the GHM award. A report will be required by
30 April 2016, by which time the funds must have been
used.
Application procedure:
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le
to Ute Friedrich at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org.
It should include your name, current status and insti-
tution, your PhD start date, your ESEB membership
number, a description of the work to be carried out
(maximum 500 words), an outline budget with brief
justication (maximum 100 words) and a signed state-
ment from your PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser
(maximum 100 words) explaining why the work cannot
be funded from your institution.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Roger Butlin. The aim will be to announce decisions
before the end of March 2015.

Suggestion
Dear all,
next semester i will be teaching an introductory course
on evolution for 4th year elementary science education
students.
we have only 40 hours, so we cannot go too much in
depth. the students' background in biology is also lim-
ited to a few biology courses. i'm therefore looking for
a brief, simple undergraduate textbook on evolution.
would anyone have any suggestions?
thank you very much in advance!

GeneticDiversity AfterDisturbance
Hi all,
I've been working on the population genetics of a
species of subterranean rodent in response to catastro-
phes, and as part of that work, I've been getting some
puzzling signs of increased genetic diversity across cer-
tain molecular markers (i.e. microsatellites) after catas-
trophes. While this is preliminary data, I'm puzzled by
these results; there's only been one other instance of
such a phenomenon I've been able to nd in the liter-
ature (Wilmer et al. 2011), and they also stated that
it was mechanistically dicult to explain. I wanted to
reach out and see if anyone had suggestions on this,
particular things to look for in genetic data, further
insight, or is aware of other similar cases.
Thanks in advance!
Best, Jeremy
jlhsu@stanford.eduINNGE constituent survey
Hello EvolDirers,
I want to let you all know about a short (5 minute)
survey about the International Network of Next-
Generation Ecologists (INNGE). We hope you would
like to take the survey if you would like to be involved
with the INNGE open network or already are (e.g. via
the INNGE mailing list, Twitter account: @INNGE-
cologist, or Facebook group).
Take the survey via this link: http://tinyurl.com/-
k3xp3da The survey is aimed to give a better char-
acterization of the international network in terms of
interests and demographics. It is also your chance to
point out what you would like to see INNGE do in the
future. The survey collects anonymous information (no
personal ID or contact is requested).
The collected data will be used to inform INNGE's gov-
erning board and working group, and in turn ensure
that INNGE is reaching and representing the needs of
early-career ecologists worldwide.
The survey contains 22 short questions, and it will take
you approximately 5 minutes, should you decide to take
it.
Help with spreading the word about this survey would
also be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks!

Phylosemiar DavidRasmussen Oct16
next talk:
David Rasmussen: Statistical inference for phylody-
namics, 2014-10-16 09:00 PDT
Phylodynamic methods are widely used to estimate
demographic parameters and historical population dy-
namics from genealogies of individuals sampled from a
population. In this phyloseminar, I will describe how
we can understand genealogies in terms of basic demo-
graphic or ecological processes, and how these concepts
can be used to develop statistical models for inference.
In particular, I will discuss some similarities and dif-
ferences between the two main modeling frameworks in
phylodynamics: the coalescent and birth-death models.
I will also briey introduce some of the latest statistical
methods currently used to t these models to genealo-
gies. I will end by discussing one of the main challengesfacing the eld|adequately representing the structure
of complex, heterogenous populations in phylodynamic
models.

Matthew Hall: Epidemic reconstruction in a phyloge-
netics framework, 2014-10-09 09:00 PDT
Major recent advances in genome sequencing technol-
ogy make it feasible that in future epidemics, a sequence
will be available for every clinical case that can be
identied. In some scenarios, such as agricultural epi-
demics (where farm-to-farm spread is of more interest
than animal-to-animal), diseases such as HIV (where
most infected individuals will eventually present them-
selves to clinicians), and epidemics occurring in well-
monitored populations such as hospital inpatients, we
will as a consequence be able to acquire a set of se-
quences representing the pathogens infecting most or
all cases in the transmission chain. Genetic data there-
fore provides an important new tool for the investiga-
tion of epidemics, in particular the determination of
the epidemic's transmission tree, which describes which
case infected which others. As the genetic diversity in
a set of sequences taken from the same epidemic will
not be enormous even for fast-evolving RNA viruses,
the best approach would be to combine both genetic
and epidemiological data. I present here a new method
for transmission tree reconstruction which is integrated
into the Bayesian phylogenetics framework available in
BEAST. It is based on the observation that if the phy-
logeny is know, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between possible transmission trees and partitions of
the internal nodes of the tree into connected subgraphs.
The MCMC procedure in BEAST has been modied to
sample from the space of trees with nodes partitioned in
this way, simultaneously estimating both phylogenetic
tree and transmission tree. Rather than assuming that
the entire tree is generated by a single coalescent pro-
cess, the posterior probability of a phylogeny is now
calculated based on an individual-based model of dis-
ease transmission, which can take into account epidemi-
ological characteristics of the host cases, such as spatial
location. I will outline results using simulated data andNovember 1, 2014 EvolDir 117

SanDiegoZoo Cryopreservation
Dear Colleagues (with apologies for duplicate postings):
*PLEASE DISTRIBUTE TO OTHER LISTS AS YOU
THINK APPROPRIATE*:
I am asking for help in locating active tissue/cell line
cryopreservation programs for endangered species. The
extant population of the Catarina Pupsh, *Megup-
silon apodus*, now consists solely of two males at the
Dallas aquarium; the single known natural population
was wiped out in the 1990's. The species is essentially
already extinct. I have been trying to nd a program
that would be interested in establishing and preserv-
ing cell lines or even simply storing tissue samples from
one or both of the last surviving individuals. I thought
I had located one such program associated with the San
Diego zoo. What follows is the text of an e-mail I sent
that program on 6 October:
'San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research
15600 San Pasqual Valley Road Escondido, California
92027
The unique 'Catarina Pupsh,' *Megupsilon aporus*,
is now eectively extinct, because the captive refugium
population previously maintained by the Dallas Aquar-
ium now consists of two males and 0 females. The single
known natural population, conned to a single spring in
central Mexico, was wiped out in the early 1990's when
the habitat was completely destroyed, and the two Dal-
las individuals are the last representatives of the species
on the planet.
I am therefore asking if your 'frozen zoo' program would
be interested in adding biological material from *M.
apodus* to your collection. Assuming that is the case,
I would appreciate it if you would let me know the steps
that need to be taken so that this may be accomplished.
I am not well versed in tissue culture and related tech-
niques, but I suspect that the technology does exist to
derive cell lines from the extant animals and cryopre-
serve them. Put more simply, we need to know just
what to do next.It is my understanding that the surviving two *M. apo-
dus* males will shortly be in the possession of Dr.
Chris Martin at Berkeley. He is planning to attempt
to hybridize them with females of a related species,
*Cyprinodon alverezi *(which has been accomplished
by others in the past*) *and hopes to eventually to use
new genome editing tools to selectively remove the *C.
alverezi* genes from the hybrid lineage. I believe that it
will very likely be possible for him to take tissue sam-
ples (perhaps from n clips) from one or both males
that could be used to initiate cell lines.
Among the many ways in which *M. apodus* is un-
usual or unique is its multiple sex chromosome system,
which was the rst example to be described in verte-
brates. While similar systems have subsequently been
described in other sh species, the enormous Y chro-
mosome of *M. apodus* has no known equivalent, and
it should be of great interest to students of sex chro-
mosome evolution. Even if the species itself cannot be
restored by contemporary conservation eorts, it would
be extremely worthwhile to preserve its cells so that its
Y chromosome will be available to cytogeneticists in the
future. '
This e-mail has thus far elicited no response. While
I do realize that only a few days have passed since I
sent it, I would have thought that the obvious urgency
of the situation would have merited at least a formal
acknowledgement of receipt. I am concerned that my
information may not be correct, or that I addressed it
to the wrong person, and that precious time may be
wasted. Consequently, I'm asking for help in locating
other programs and/or nding the proper routes to ap-
proach them, or in networking that might lead to these
goals. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

SequenceBundles software testers
Invitation to test Sequence Bundles - a new method for
visualising motifs and MSAs
Dear Evoldir members,
Over the past year, Science Practice together with the
Goldman research group at the European Bioinformat-
ics Institute (EBI) have been working together to design
a new free open source interactive tool for visualising,
exploring and discovering sequence motifs using a new118 EvolDir November 1, 2014
visualisation method called Sequence Bundles.
We're launching the alpha version of the tool within the
next couple of days and are looking for researchers in
the eld interested in testing it.
As well as making sure that the software we are creat-
ing is functional and accessible, we are interested in its
ability to support research by enabling exploration and
the discovery of otherwise hidden motifs and features.
If you are interested in trying the Sequence Bundles
visualisation tool and willing to help us design and de-
velop a valuable tool for researchers, please get in touch
(by emailing ana@science-practice.com).
We will send you the alpha version of the Sequence
Bundles software and a brief overview of its key fea-
tures and how to use them. We would be very grateful
if after trying out the tool you would be available for
a short call to give us your feedback. We're interested
not only in the functionality of the tool, but also on the
added value of the visualisation - does it enable the dis-
covery of interesting motifs, does it help generate new
insights into your data and research?
You can read more about the design process that
led to the development of Sequence Bundles as well
as the discoveries we made using the visualisation in
the paper we wrote for BMC Proceedings at http://-
www.biomedcentral.com/1753-6561/8/S2/S8 or on our
project page at http://science-practice.com/projects/-
sequence-bundles/ If you know of anyone else who
would be interested in trying out Sequence Bundles
please let us know or feel free to forward them this
invitation.
Thank you very much for your time and looking forward
to learning how Sequence Bundles can help inform your
research!

TansleyMedal for PlantEvolution
Calling all early-stage career scientists!The New Phytologist Tansley Medal is awarded annu-
ally in recognition of an outstanding contribution to
research in plant science by an individual in the early
stages of their career (student and post-doctoral re-
searchers with up to ve years' experience since gain-
ing/defending their PhD are eligible). The winner will
receive a prize of $2000 (GBP) and will author a short
review that will be published in New Phytologist ac-
companied by a comment from the Editor-in-Chief and
Tansley reviews Editor. The application deadline for
this year's Medal is *1 December 2014*.
New Phytologist highlights the importance of plant
evolution by dedicating one of its four key sections to
this research area, covering studies from the molecular
to ecological level. One of last year's co-winners,
Dr Jing-Ke Weng, is a plant evolutionary biologist
from the Whitehead Institute, Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, USA whose research focuses
on plant metabolic evolution. Read Jing-Ke's win-
ning Minireview 'The evolutionary paths towards
complexity: a metabolic perspective' here: http://-
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12416/full.
(The other co-winner of the 2013 Tansley Medal
was Dr Li-Qing Chen of the Carnegie Institution for
Science, USA whose winning Minireview is entitled
'SWEET sugar carriers for phloem transport and
pathogen nutrition <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/-
doi/10.1111/nph.12445/abstract >'.)
The Tansley Medal is an opportunity to award recog-
nition to an outstanding scientist in the early stages
of his or her career and supporting and nurturing the
next generation of plant scientists is a core aspect of
the activities of the New Phytologist Trust. I would be
very grateful if you would support us in this endeav-
our by spreading the word to anyone you know who
might be eligible to apply for the 2015 Tansley Medal.

tween Imperial College London (IC) (two positions)
and University of Exeter (UE) (one position). The
three 3-year PDRA positions are funded by a UK Na-

The newly established Research Group Evolutionary
Immunogenomics in the Department of Evolutionary
Ecology at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on/Germany has an opening for a
Post-Doctoral Research Fellow
Our research explores the evolution of immunogenetic
and genomic variability and its implications for individ-
ual immunocompetence and ultimately tness. We are
mainly focusing on data from human populations, us-
ing a wide spectrum of approaches from molecular biol-
ogy and high-throughput sequencing to computational
analyses and theoretical modeling, but also employ ex-
perimental model systems (stickleback, mouse) to test
predictions in the lab. Our scientic motivation ranges
from pure curiosity about evolutionary processes to the
desire to push the practical boundaries of Evolutionary
and Personalized Medicine. Specic projects within the
scheme of the lab are exible and can be tailored to
skills and interest of the successful candidate.
The group is part of the Max Planck Institute for Evo-
lutionary Biology with its vibrant and collaborative re-
search community of experimental, computational, and
theoretical labs that all share a common interested in
Evolutionary Biology. Cutting edge infrastructure is
available at all levels, including high-performance com-
puter clusters, a next-gen sequencing core facility, as
well as molecular and experimental labs with substan-
tial sh and mouse rearing facilities. The institute also
maintains strong ties to Kiel University with large com-
munities in evolutionary biology and medical genetics.
Furthermore, our lab is currently collaborating on a
number of projects with groups at Harvard Medical
School in Boston and the University of Texas in Austin.

Montpellier InvasivePopGenetics
Postdoctoral Position on the genetics of invasive popu-
lations
We seek to hire a post-doctoral research associate
for a Grand Federative Project funded by the French
Agropolis Fondation1 called BIOFIS \Bioagressors and
invasive species: from individual to population to
species". The project is dedicated to develop, coordi-
nate and communicate research actions on bioagressors
in Europe (insects, mites, trees, fungi and virus) and
on their associated natural enemies.
Term and location: The position should start in Decem-
ber 2014 at the latest. Support is for one year. This po-
sition is co-supervised by E. Klein (INRA - BIOSP, Avi-
gnon France) and V. Ravign e (CIRAD - BGPI, Mont-
pellier, France). We encourage the postdoctoral fellow
to be based in Montpellier but being hosted in Avignon
is also possible.
Project: Bioinvasions have long been considered as
purely ecological processes until researchers recognize
that evolutionary processes such as drift and selection
may play a substantial role in their success. Recently
particular attention has been paid to evolutionary pro-
cesses occurring during spatial expansions. Selection
for dierent life-history strategies at the source and
front of invasions is expected to aect the speed of
spatial spread. The strong eects of genetic drift as-
sociated to the specic demography of an expansion
(in particular successive funding eects distributed in
space) may as well shape the neutral and selected di-
versity along invasion waves. To better understand the
interaction between drift, selection, and dispersal, we
wish to design and analyze spatially explicit simulation
models allowing studying the spatial spread of bene-
cial/neutral/deleterious mutations during a coloniza-
tion process. We are particularly interested in study-
ing the eect of i) environmental heterogeneity and ii)
non-standard mating systems (e.g., mixing sexual and
asexual reproduction) on the process. This work is ex-
pected to produce useful results for approaches basedon the analysis of population genetic structure along
invasion waves such as (i) the reconstruction of inva-
sion routes (ii) the detection of traces of selection using
genome scans.
The output of these theoretical developments will be
confronted to an existing dataset describing the popu-
lation structure of a fungal pathogen of bananas along
an invasion corridor in Cameroon. Depending on the
candidate's interests, other links with empirical work in
the team may be considered.
We seek a young researcher who combines with a
strong conceptual background in evolutionary biology
and some modeling skills (mathematics and/or com-
puter science). Experience with programming and pop-
ulation genetics is required. Skills in data analysis are
not necessary but will be considered positively. Facil-
ity in writing is important. The post-doc will benet
by working as a member of the BIOFIS project team
with an extent network of collaborators interested in
dispersal, invasion biology, plant pathology, evolution-
ary biology and population genetics.
Eligibility: Agropolis Fondation typically considers ap-
plications from candidates that have not resided or
carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc) in
France for more than 12 months in the 3 years imme-
diately prior to the date of submission of the proposal
and that have obtained their PhD degree for no more
than 3 years upon the date of application. However,
we encourage excellent candidates not entirely fulll-
ing these conditions to contact us, as these might be
funded if no other eligible candidate satises scientic
requirements for the job.

EvolutionaryGenomics
Researcher position in evolutionary biology and ge-
nomics
A one year position as researcher is available at the
Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), Department
of Biology, NTNU. CBD is a Norwegian Centre of Ex-
cellence.
The aim of the project is to examine ecological adapta-
tion on the molecular genetic level by using an associa-
tion mapping approach to identify the genomic regions,
and, ultimately, the causative mutations, that code
for important ecological traits. This will be achieved
using state-of-the-art high density Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP) genotype data. Such data is al-
ready available for 2300 individuals genotyped on a 10k
SNP array, and additional data on >3000 individu-
als genotyped on a 200k SNP array will be available
early 2015. The genotyped individuals are from a long-
term study of insular house sparrow populations at the
coast of Norway with extensive pedigrees and long-term
individual-level data on phenotypic trait values and t-
ness. Hence, this project will provide insights into the
molecular genetic basis of trait variation in natural pop-
ulations. Furthermore, the goal is to understand how
population size aects short-term rates of evolution-
ary change, by examining how population size aectsstrength and direction of selection, levels of additive
genetic variance, and observed rates of change at the
molecular genetic level. The successful candidate will
have the possibility to develop his/her own ideas to
approach the above issues, including opportunities for
eldwork and laboratory work.
The work of the successful candidate will be carried
out within the research group of Associate Professor
Henrik Jensen at the Centre for Biodiversity Dynam-
ics, NTNU. The candidate will be based at CBD. The
working language is English.
Information about the Centre for Biodiversity Dy-
namics can be found here: www.ntnu.edu/cbd.

vantageous. The successful candidate must be able to
work eciently and goal-oriented both when working
independently and when collaborating with others. We
are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic can-
didate.
What we oer We can oer an exciting research project
with focus on fundamental questions in evolutionary bi-
ology using state-of-the-art molecular genetic analyses.
The researcher will carry out scientically challenging
research with good opportunities for development of
his/her expertise. The successful candidate will ben-
et from a good working environment and the exper-
tise of members in our research group, which currently
consists of an Associate professor, two postdoctoral re-
searchers, one PhD-student, three MSc-students and a
laboratory technician. We collaborate with leading re-
search groups both in Norway and abroad, and visits at
these will be possible. The successful candidate should
start no later than 1st January 2015. The appointment
of the researcher will be made according to Norwegian
guidelines for universities and university colleges and to
the general regulations regarding university employees.
NTNU has a personnel policy objective that the sta
must reect the composition of the population to the

TUDelft EvolutionaryBiology
Post-Doc: Reproducibility and reversibility of evolu-
tionary trajectories. Job description In previous ex-
periments we have evolved nearly dead budding yeast
cells (we removed a nearly essential gene) for one thou-
sand generations. At the end of the evolution those
cells approached wild-type growth rate and cell size.
We sequenced the nal time points and found three
mutations that appeared in the same order in several
independent lines, which is remarkable, since most ex-
perimental evolution experiments do not show this high
level of reproducibility. In this project you will exploit
this characterized system to ask questions about evo-
lution, such as, how predictable is an evolutionary tra-
jectory and how much does this depend on the specics
of the selection? Is adapting to genetic perturbations,
like cancer cells do, intrinsically more predictable than
adaptations to a new environment? Another potential
question is: Can you ever go back in evolution or is evo-
lution always irreversible? So what happens if you rst
delete a gene, adapt cells to higher tness and subse-
quently reintroduce the gene and evolve the cells again?
Are there regimes where the cells will evolve back to
the original state? You will answer these questions us-
ing experimental evolution, whole genome sequencing
and sequence analysis. The aim is to combine the ex-
perimental ndings with population dynamics theory,
potentially in collaboration with a theory group.

PatternsGenomicDiversity
The CMPG lab (http://cmpg.iee.unibe.ch) at the Uni-
versity of Berne is opening 2 new PhD and 1 post-doc
positions in January 2015.
The*post*doc position is available for 1 year to model
the pattern of genomic diversity created during range134 EvolDir November 1, 2014
expansions. A computer simulation framework will be
developed to 1) detect typical signatures of range ex-
pansions at the molecular level and 2) to co-estimate
the distribution of tness eects and the past history
of populations from their patterns of genomic diversity.
The rst PhD position is in evolutionary theory under
the main supervision of Dr. Stephan Peischl. It will
consist in studying the interactions between ecology,
demography and selection at range margins.
The second PhD position is in human population ge-
nomics, and will be mainly supervised by Prof. Laurent
Excoer. It will consist in improving methods to de-
tect selection at the gene network level and after range
expansions in humans.
The two PhD positions are available for 3 years.
We are looking for highly motivated individuals with
a good background in population genomics, statistics,
and advanced computational skills, and with strong oral
and written communication abilities.
The CMPG lab is hosted by the Institute of Ecology
and Evolution at the University of Berne, and it of-
fers a very international and stimulating research envi-
ronment. It is also aliated to the Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics (SIB) which oers ample potential for
interactions. Berne is ideally located in the middle of
Switzerland and Europe, and provides rich cultural and
outdoor activities.
The gross salary of the post-doc candidate would be
around 80,000 CHF per year and those of PhD stu-
dents around 32,000 CHF, per year. All three positions
are expected to start in January 2015.
For any position, please send, before November 15th
2014, an application letter stating your motivation for
the position, a CV, and contact information of two ref-
erences to laurent.excoer@iee.unibe.ch (for Post-Doc

tation to heterogeneous environments. The aim of this
post-doctoral project is to develop new theoretical mod-
els on adaptation to spatially and temporally variable
environments under selng. An important issue will
be to explicitly take into account the complex genetic
architecture of adaptive traits and to consider the in-
terplay between selection and drift as well as gene ow
under specic selng rates. Extension of models of evo-
lutionary rescue to the case of populations reproducing
through partial or predominant selng will also be of
interest.

ferent perspectives (evolutionary biology, conservation
biology, exploration and exploitation of naturally oc-
curring genetic variation) who all have made signicant
contributions to the eld over the last 15 to 20 years.
The candidate will join the research group GE2POP

perennial herb Primula farinosa as a model system, and
focuses on the importance of variation in oral traits
and life history in relation to dierences in abiotic con-
ditions, the intensity of biotic interactions, and climate.
The project will combine demographic studies, eld ex-
periments, and population modeling, to address three
main questions: (1) How is population viability inu-
enced by local environmental conditions, grazing inten-
sity and climatic variation?, (2) How does variation in

genetic structure of plant populations?, and (3) How
does the presence of genetic variation in traits of adap-
tive signicance and evolutionary responses inuence
population viability in a changing environment? Spe-
cic subprojects can be tailored to the skills and inter-
ests of the successful candidate.
The project is a collaboration between the labs of prof
JonAgren at the Department of Ecology and Genetics,
Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, and
prof Johan Ehrl en at the Department of Ecology, En-
vironment and Plant Sciences, Stockholm University.
We are currently recruiting one postdoc to be placed at

fers an exciting opportunity to join a research team
led by Prof Jeremy Field working on the behavioural
and evolutionary ecology of social systems (http://-

the project is to use a combination of approaches from
behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics to inves-
tigate queen-worker coadaptation and conict in prim-
itively eusocial sweat bees (Lasioglossum). The resolu-
tion of reproductive conicts has been well studied both
theoretically and empirically in eusocial Hymenoptera.
However, much less is known about the coevolutionary
process involved, and the underlying trait architecture.
The work will lead to a comprehensive understanding
of queen-worker coevolution, including the rst tests of
several key hypotheses.
Work will be carried out at Sussex University,
also involving collaboration with Prof Mathias
K olliker (University of Basel, Switzerland: http://-

volve a combination of large-scale eld experiments in
the UK, and genetic work using microsatellite markers.
There will be a technician working on the project who
will carry out much of the molecular work.
The successful applicant will have a Ph.D in be-
havioural/evolutionary biology. Experience with ani-
mal social systems and quantitative genetics, and ex-
perience of eldwork, molecular techniques and statis-
tical analysis using ^ aR' and similar programs would all
be useful, but it is not necessary to have experience in
all of these areas. Possession of a clean driving licence

The course content will cover the concepts and R tools
that can be used to analyse spatial data in ecology cov-
ering elementary and advanced spatial analysis tech-
niques applicable to both plants and animals. It will
investigate analyses appropriate to transect (e.g. line
surveys, trapping arrays), grid (e.g. occupancy surveys)
and point data (e.g. telemetry). The focal questions
will be on deriving species distributions, determining154 EvolDir November 1, 2014
their environmental drivers and quantifying dierent

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
