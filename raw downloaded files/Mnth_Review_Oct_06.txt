MEEGID VIII Bangkok, Thailand. 30th November-3rd
December 2006
Call for conferences/symposia proposals and papers
The 8th International Meeting “Molecular Epidemiol-
ogy and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases”
(MEEGID VIII) will be held in Bangkok, Thailand,
30th November morning-3rd December noon 2006. As
for the 7 ﬁrst MEEGID meetings, it will be co-organized
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC; http://www.cdc.gov/ ) in Atlanta and the Insti-October 1, 2006 EvolDir 3
tut de Recherche pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD; http:/-
/www.ird.fr/ ) in France. Mahidol University ( http:/-
/www.ird.fr/ www.mahidol.ac.th/ ) will be an oﬀﬁcial
co-organizer of the meeting, which will be supported
also by the French Embassy in Bangkok ( http://-
www.ambafrance-th.org/ ).
The MEEGID meetings are organized in synergy
with the new journal Infection, Genetics and Evolu-
tion (Elsevier; http://www.elsevier.com/locate/meegid
), which scientiﬁc topic is identical to that of the
MEEGID. Launched only 5 years ago, Infection, Ge-
netics and Evolution is now published with 6 issues per
year, and is covered by Medline and Index Medicus,
starting from the 1st issue. It has been quoted 3.5/5.0
(“very good”) by the US National Library of Medicine.
It is now covered by ISI and an oﬃcial impact factor
will be available soon. IF evaluated by Elsevier from
the SCOPUS database is 3.195.
Communications on genetics, genomics, proteomics,
population biology, mathematical modelling, bioinfor-
matics are welcome. They can deal with the host, the
pathogen, or the vector in case of vector-borne diseases.
Papers considering host + pathogen or pathogen +
vector (co-evolution) are particularly encouraged. All
pathogens are within the scope of MEEGID: viruses,
parasitic protozoa, helminths, fungal organisms, prion.
All infectious models can be considered, including those
of veterinary or agronomical relevance.
The papers communicated for MEEGID VIII will be
published in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and
Evolution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002). MEEGID VIII will include 10-15 plenary lec-
tures, about 20 specialized symposia, 12-15 “express-
debates” (20 mn presentation by only one speaker fol-
lowed by 40 mn free discussion) and several poster ses-
sions.
Special emphasis through plenary lectures and sym-
posia will be given to health problems of particular
interest to Thailand and South-East Asia: avian ﬂu,
SARS, malaria, dengue, tuberculosis. Pleanary lec-
tures and symposia will also deal with trasnversal topics
such as population genetics or species concepts. The
congress is still open to proposals of conferences and
symposia.
The following topics for symposia and/or plenary lec-
tures have been already selected
Aedes aegypti: population biology, epidemiological role
Avian ﬂu Anthropozoonoses Contribution of private in-
dustry to infectious disease control Cytokine genetics
Foodborne viruses Host-pathogen interactions HIV Hu-
man genetics/genomics and transmission of infectiousdiseases Human immune response gene polymorphism
versus HIV-1 and dengue virus diversity in SE Asians
Integrative models for the dynamics of antigenically-
diverse pathogens. Malaria Modern approaches to med-
ical entomology : morphometry and population genet-
ics Mycobacterium tuberculosis epidemiology, molecu-
lar typing and evolution Pharmacogenomics Phylogeog-
raphy Population genetics of pathogens Trypanosome
evolution and pathogenic role in humans and animals
Vectors: Population structure and Genetic structure
Viral evolution and inferences of natural selection
Awards will be attributed to the best communication,
the best communication by a student and the best com-
munication by a scientist from the Southern World on
a problem speciﬁcally relevant to these areas. Each
prizewinner will be oﬀered a free 2-year copies to Infec-
tion, Genetics and Evolution.
Abstract submission deadline: 31st October.
Registration Fee: 200.00 euros or equivalent in other
currencies; Thai scientists : 2400 bahts. Reduced rates
for scientists from other southern coutries upon request,
if external grants are unavailable. Students pay only

Dear Colleague:
This is to invite you to attend an Arthur M. Sackler
colloquium, In the Light of Evolution: Adaptation and
Complex Design, sponsored by the National Academyof Sciences. The Colloquium will be December 1-2,
2006, at the Beckman Center of the National Academies
of Sciences and Engineering in Irvine, California.
Darwin’s elucidation of natural selection was one of the
great intellectual achievements in the history of science,
revolutionizing thought not only in biology but also in
philosophical and ideological realms. A century-and-a-
half after Darwin, the challenge of understanding na-
ture’s complex design remains in many regards in its
infancy. Scientiﬁc advances are coming at a time of
resurgent societal interest in supernatural explanations
for biological complexity. The goal of this NAS Sackler
Colloquium is to synthesize recent empirical ﬁndings
and conceptual approaches towards understanding the
evolutionary origins and maintenance of complex adap-
tations.
The Preliminary Program can be viewed at http:/-
/www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=-
SACKLER evolution program Attendance at the
Colloquium is limited to 250 registered individuals.
To facilitate the participation of younger scientists,
we request that you extend this invitation to inter-
ested graduate students and postdocs. The NAS has
provided funds to supplement the expenses of partici-
pating graduate students and postdocs up to $125 for
hotel costs and $150 for air travel. A maximum of 100
awards will be granted, with priority based exclusively
on the order in which requests (accompanied by the
registration fee) are received. Notiﬁcation of the award
will be made shortly after receiving the application but
the awards will be paid after the Colloquium, upon
documentation of qualifying expenses.
Please register on the NAS web-
site <http://www.nasonline.org/-
Sackler evolution >www.nasonline.org/-
Sackler evolution . Registrations will be accepted
only when the registration fee is included and in the
order in which they are received. The registration fee
is $350, which includes the cost of meals, reception,
and banquet. However, an early registration fee of
$250 (also including meals, reception, and banquet) is
available to those posting their registration by October
15, 2006. A reduced all-inclusive registration fee of
$150 is oﬀered to Graduate Students and Postdocs

Evolutionary Change in Human-altered Environments
An International Summit
February 8-10, 2007 Institute of the Environment Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles
Organized by Thomas Smith and Louis Bernatchez.
Human activities are aﬀecting the evolutionary pro-
cesses that generate and maintain biodiversity. Climate
change and deforestation are facilitating the evolution-
ary jump of animal diseases to humans. Fish farming
has resulted in the spread of poorly adaptive genes to
the wild. Introductions of exotic species are impacting
native species and limiting their ability to adapt.
In response to this developing crisis, we are convening
an international summit of evolutionary biologists, con-
servation practitioners, and policy makers to synthesize
current knowledge and to begin to develop plans to mit-
igate the eﬀects. The summit will feature talks from
more than 40 leading evolutionary biologists, poster
presentations, and working groups. A central goal of
the summit is to bring the discussion beyond academic
boundaries to frame real-world solutions to these prob-
lems. For more information and to submit an abstract

6 - 8 December 2006, University of Wollongong, NSW
plus two day pre and post conference workshops (4-5th
Dec, 9-10 Dec)
The objective of this meeting is to bring together stu-
dents, established researchers, naturalists and members
of government and NGO agencies that have an interest
in molluscs. The meeting will focus on current research
involving molluscs in the Australasian area.
Molluscs are the second largest animal phylum and
many are ecologically and economically important.
They are dominant organisms in marine environments
and have suﬀered more human-induced extinctions onland and in freshwaters than seen in all tetrapod verte-
brates.
Themes:
* Applied studies (aquaculture, ﬁsheries, parasitology,
invasive species) * Conservation and ecology (including
endangered species, indicator species, molluscs in ex-
perimental ecology, tracking environmental changes) *
Systematics (including taxonomy, phylogeny, evolution,
faunistics, biogeography) * Genetics and development
(population genetics, evolution-development, larval de-
velopment)
Venue: McKinnon Centre, University of Wollongong.
Wollongong is about 1.5 hrs by road or rail south of
Sydney. Details on other options for travel to Wol-

Malaria is a parasitic disease endemic in most of the
tropical and subtropical ecosystems worldwide and ex-hibits great geographic diversity. My ongoing research
focuses on investigating the mechanisms involved in the
maintenance of genetic polymorphisms in natural pop-
ulations of malarial parasites in primates (humans and
non-human), assessing the evolution of speciﬁc proteins
involved in the invasion of the host red blood cell, and
the phylogeography of macaque malarias.
Applicants should comply with ASU requirements. The
student is expected to learn both laboratory and com-
putational skills. Knowledge in evolutionary biology
and molecular biology at the level of undergraduate
courses is expected. A course in general microbiologyOctober 1, 2006 EvolDir 13
is desirable.
The school of Life Sciences in Arizona State Univer-
sity oﬀers several graduate programs; please check the
Integrative Graduate Education in the Life Sciences
(iGELS) website for details ( http://sols.asu.edu/grad/-
igels/index.php ).
The graduate students at ASU have the opportunity of

TWO PHD POSITIONS IN MATHEMATICAL IM-
MUNOLOGY AND VIROLOGY AT THE ETH
ZURICH, SWITZERLAND:
Two PhD positions are available in the group of Roland
Regoes at the ETH Zurich (see www.tb.ethz.ch/-
people/regoes ). In our group we study quantitative
aspects of infectious diseases between and within hosts.
I am looking for a PhD student who is interested in
studying the within host dynamics of viruses. Strong
quantitative skills (population dynamical modeling,
biostatistics, or computer simulations), or the will to
acquire them, are an advantage because the work in
my group is quite mathematical. The starting date can
be as soon as possible, but should not be too much later
than Feb 2007.
Speciﬁc questions, which the PhD students can study,
are how Human-Immunodeﬁciency-Virus (HIV) en-
ters its target cells and how its entry can be pre-
vented by antibodies. Another set of questions re-
volves around the population dynamics of viruses andimmune cells within hosts, for example the dynam-
ics of Simian-Immunodeﬁciency-Virus (SIV) in diﬀer-
ent monkey species. Most of our research is done in
close collaboration with experimental virology and im-
munology laboratories.
Our group is strongly linked with the theoretical bi-
ology group of Sebastian Bonhoeﬀer, the experimental
ecology group of Paul Schmid-Hempel, and the exper-
imental evolution group of Martin Ackermann at the
Institute of Integrative Biology of the ETH Zurich (see
http://www.ibz.ethz.ch/ for more details).
Zurich is a great place to live and to do research. It
is the home of two big universties (the University of
Zurich and the ETH), and is an attractive city in beau-
tiful surroundings with a multinational population and
many educational and recreational opportunities. The
PhD salary is 33,600 Swiss Franks per year (pre-tax)
which allows a decent standard of living.
To apply send a letter describing your interest in
this position, a CV and the names and contact ad-
dresses of two referees to me, preferably by email:
roland.regoes@env.ethz.ch. Informal enquires are also
welcome.

Genes
Graduate Fellowships AVAILABLE for admission in
Fall 2007 to participate in this newly emerging ﬁeld
at the interface of ecology and genomics. This researchinitiative will link responses of living systems to envi-
ronmental change at the genetic level. The overarching
goal of this research initiative is to identify the genes
that are involved in organismal responses to the envi-
ronment.
This Ecological Genomics initiative takes advantage of
existing strengths at Kansas State University in genet-
ics and genomics, ecology and evolutionary biology to
answer cross-cutting questions that lie at the interface
of genomics and ecology. This collaborative research
eﬀort will cross disciplines (genetics and ecology) and
departments (Agronomy, Biology, Entomology, Plant
Pathology, Computing and Information Science). In
addition, this initiative will also take advantage of ex-
perimental manipulations at the Konza Prairie Long-
Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.
Research and education opportunities exist for Grad-
uate Students to work towards an MS or PhD de-
gree in this large collaborative and interdisciplinary
eﬀort. More information about the Kansas Ecologi-
cal Genomics collaborative research groups at Kansas
State University can be found at www.ksu.edu/ecogen .
Twenty faculty with interests spanning from genetics
and genomics of model organisms (Arabidopsis, C. el-
egans, Drosophila) to microbial, plant and animal or-
ganismic biology, and ecosystem ecology are involved
in this research initiative. Applicants should have the
interest and willingness to cross disciplines. Completed
applications must be received by January 5, 2007.

Biological invasions: The result of a fast evolution in
new environments?
Senecio jacobaea is introduced introduction into Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and the west coast of North Amer-October 1, 2006 EvolDir 15
ica where it is a noxious weed. Previous research
strongly suggests that a fast adaptive evolution towards
a more weedy habit in S. jacobaea plants took place
upon introduction. However, for a proper analysis of
adaptive changes upon introductions the source popu-
lations of the native area need to be compared with the
introduced environments. The candidate will therefore
ﬁrst focus on ﬁnding the source population(s) in the
native area and reconstructing the path of introduction
of S. jacobaea in Australia, New Zealand and North
America with the aid of molecular techniques such as
AFLP, microsatellites and TILLING.
To ﬁnd evidence for a fast evolution upon introduc-
tions the source populations will be compared with the
invasive populations in common garden experiments
with regard to anti-herbivore-, growth and reproduc-
tion characteristics. Bioassays will be performed with
a number of specialist and generalist herbivores.
Genetic variation in the traits of interest will be com-
pared to genetic variation in neutral molecular markers
to correct for bottlenecks.
Requirements: The candidate must have a degree
(Drs./MSc) in biology or a related study and have a
strong interest as well as expertise in evolutionary and
molecular biology.
The appointment is for a period of 4 years and is ex-
pected to lead to the completion of a dissertation. The
gross monthly salary is 1.877 in the ﬁrst year and in-
creases progressively each year to 2.407 in the fourth
year. Salary and fringe beneﬁts conform to the Col-
lective Employment Agreement for Dutch Universities.

Leipzig MicrobialBiodiversityThe Department of Environmental Microbiology of the
Center for Environmental Research Leipzig (Germany)
is currently seeking a highly motivated
PhD student (m/f) with interest and experience in Mi-
crobial Ecology
from January 1st, 2007 for a period of three years.
The position is part of the UFZ Project SAFIRA II
(Remediation Research in Regionally con-taminated
Aquifers). The goal of SAFIRA is the development
and step-by-step implementa-tion of new low-energy
and passive water treatment technologies for mixtures
of organic contaminants (especially chlorinated aromat-
ics), from a prototype to a full-scale technical appli-
cation. One approach within the project is the use of
constructed wetlands as passive mod-ules for enhanced
microbial decontamination of formerly anoxic ground-
water. The artiﬁcial wetlands serve as a platform to
study the adaptation of microbial communities to or-
ganic contamination under (semi-)natural conditions
along contamination gradients. To support the under-
standing of complex processes within the wetlands, con-
trolled laboratory experiments will accompany the ﬁeld
research.
The successful candidate will conduct microbial biodi-
versity research integrating experimental and theoret-
ical approaches. Moreover the candidate is expected
to contribute to ongoing studies of functional diversity
(across trophic levels, temporal and spatial scales) of
microbial communities applying various approaches in
close collaboration with diﬀerent working groups and
participating departments. A broad range of estab-
lished methods will be used in the project. This in-
cludes aerobic and anaerobic cultivation, community
ﬁngerprinting (SSCP, T-RLFP, PLFA), high speed cell
sorting, analyses of inorganic and organic compounds,
the application of stable isotope techniques and various
statistical methods for data interpretation.
We are looking for a highly motivated student with
a strong background and interest in microbiology
and ecology. Applicants should hold a corresponding
Diploma or Master degree.

MurdochU DolphinPopulations
Murdoch University, in collaboration with the Uni-
versity of New South Wales and University of
Zurich/Switzerland, is about to commence a large dol-
phin research program, initially focussing on bottlenose
dolphins oﬀ Bunbury, south-western Australia, about
160 km south of Perth. This is the ﬁrst stage of a long-
term commitment to research in the region by Murdoch
University to preserve the balance between conserva-
tion of marine environments and sustainability of local
dolphin tourism and industrial-port activities.
The overall aim of this ﬁrst step is to assess the long-
term viability of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops sp.
population around Bunbury by building an understand-
ing of their ecology, biology, gene ﬂow with other geo-
graphic areas and interactions with the environment,
food resources and human activities. This research
will commence with ﬁve synergistic projects, each as-
sociated with a Ph.D., and supervised by leading re-
searchers in their ﬁelds.
The aim of Project 1 (supervised by Dr Lars Bejder
and Prof. Stuart Bradley) is to gain an understanding
of the abundance, ecology, biology and natural history
of the local dolphin population in the waters around
Bunbury. Results from Project 1 will provide funda-
mental information to all other projects. The aim of
Project 2 (Drs Peter Spencer, Michael Kruetzen and
Assoc. Prof. Bill Sherwin) is to estimate the genetic
connectedness between various populations of Tursiopsalong the south-western WA coast from Albany to north
of metropolitan Perth, with an emphasis on dolphins in-
habiting the Bunbury area. Project 3 (Prof. Neil Lon-
eragan and Dr Lars Bejder) examines the dynamics of
dolphin prey species in relation to dolphin distribution
and abundance and the environment. Research in this
project will be carried out in close collaboration with
the research in Project 1. Project 4 (Dr Lars Bejder and
Prof. Stuart Bradley) investigates the impacts of hu-
man activities on dolphins (tourism, shipping, port de-
velopment, recreation). Projects 1-4 will provide data
to modify an existing demographic model of WA dol-
phins and to forecast the future growth or decline of
the Bunbury population under a variety of impact and
management scenarios for Project 5 (Assoc. Prof. Bill
Sherwin and Prof. Stuart Bradley).
We are currently seeking applications from highly quali-
ﬁed candidates for the three Ph.D. projects ??? Project
2 (???dolphin genetics???), 3 (???dolphin prey???) and
4 (???impacts on dolphins???). Ph.D. students for
Projects 1 and 5 have already been selected.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL THREE
Ph.D. POSITIONS:
As the overall project consists of ﬁve inter-related com-
ponents, the successful candidates will be expected to
be able to work independently but also in close col-
laboration with a team of interdisciplinary researchers.
Applicants must enjoy working in a team and be willing
to work with and lead small groups of volunteers.
Successful candidates will be team-orientated, self-
motivated, independent, enthusiastic, hard-working,
organized and have strong communication and people
skills. The ability to work relatively unsupervised, plan
work, achieve results and demonstrate commitment will
be looked upon favorably in the selection process.

BegoniaSystematics
A PhD scholarship is available at the Royal Botanic
Garden Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow to
study the systematics of Sulawesi Begonia. The project
will start in March 2007 and run for 3 years, supervised
by Dr. James Richardson and Dr. Mark Hughes from
RBGE, and Dr. Rod Page from the University of Glas-
gow.
Begonia is one of the worlds largest angiosperm genera,
and a core research group of the RBGE science strategy.
The project will investigate the systematics of Begonia
from Sulawesi, which has a geologically complex geolog-
ical history and is separated from its nearest neighbour,
Borneo, by the biogeographic division of Wallace’s Line.
The Begonia ﬂora of the island is poorly known, with
an estimated 50% of the species remaining to be de-
scribed. In common with much of the islands biota,
they are of enigmatic biogeographic origin.
The aims of the project are to: 1. Complete the Be-
gonia species inventory for Sulawesi. 2. Explain theirorigin in terms of dispersal, migration and local speci-
ation by using molecular phylogenetic techniques.
The research will involve classical herbarium techniques
as well as molecular laboratory work. Candidates must
be able to undertake several weeks ﬁeldwork in Su-
lawesi.
Applicants must hold a good honours degree (2.1 or
1st) in a relevant Biological Science and be elegible to
pay Glasgow University tuition fees at the home rate
(UK / EU students). The stipend is £12,300 per year.
The student will be registered at Glasgow University,
and be based at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.
To apply, please send a CV, covering letter (as .pdf or
.doc) and the names and contact details of two referees
to Mark Hughes (m.hughes@rbge.ac.uk). The closing
date is 1st November 2006. Please do not hesitate to

UAdelaide EvolInvasiveness
We require a highly motivated PhD student to carry out
research aimed at characterising the potential for in-
traspeciﬁc and interspeciﬁc hybridisation and introgres-
sion involving adaptive genes between native species20 EvolDir October 1, 2006
and invasive weeds. Genomic changes as a result of both
hybridisation and introgression have been implicated
in the evolution of invasiveness in several weed species,
but direct evidence is often lacking. The student will be
part of a multidisciplinary group, linked with other in-
ternational projects, working to understand the molec-
ular and ecological mechanisms underlying the evolu-
tion of invasiveness. The successful applicant will work
on the case study Australian weed system, Senecio
madagascariensis, which was introduced approximately
100 years ago and now hybridises with the native S.
pinnatifolius complex. A combination of diﬀerent tech-
niques will be combined to assess this question, in-
cluding: population genetic analysis to assess source
of introduction, admixture potential and genetic di-
versity dynamics; molecular assignment tests to assess
the extent of introgression in contemporary and histor-
ical (herbarium) population collections; adaptive gene
markers (developed separately) will also be mapped ge-
netically and assessed for evidence of selective sweeps
to further understand micro-evolutionary changes dur-
ing the invasion process. The student will be enrolled
at the University of Adelaide, Australia, which has ex-
cellent molecular genetic and ancient DNA facilities.
The student will be provided with a full stipend worth
$24000. Technical skills and experience required: 1.
Bachelor Degree in evolutionary or biological sciences
combined with an excellent Honours/Masters degree or
equivalent. 2. An interest in using molecular meth-
ods and population modelling to understand the evo-
lution of invasiveness in weed species. 3. Strong in-
terest in the application of molecular tools to dissect
and understand fundamental evolutionary processes at
molecular and ecological levels. 4. Ability to work in
a laboratory using aseptic techniques. 5. Ability to
initiate and conduct original research. The position
will remain open until a suitable applicant is found.

AdaptationToHeavyMetals
A 3 year PhD studentship is available at the University
of Glamorgan, in the ﬁeld of Molecular Ecology start-
ing November 2006, studying adaptation and evolutionwithin heavy metal contaminated environments.
Supervisor: Dr Georgina Harper, University of Glam-
organ Co-supervised by Mike Bruford & John Morgan
at Cardiﬀ University
The project will be to investigate evolution and adapta-
tion within populations of the earthworm species Lum-
bricus rubellus that are subject to high levels of Ni
contamination in their environment. Heavy metal pol-
lution such as this is increasingly an environmental
hazard in industrialised countries, and research into
the consequences is vital to understand the ecologi-
cal impact. It will be part of a large collaborative
project being carried out at Cardiﬀ University, Glamor-
gan, and Imperial College. Speciﬁcally, the project will
utilise molecular genetic markers (such as Microsatel-
lites and Ampliﬁed Fragment Length Polymorphisms),
and will investigate the relationship of this genetic data
to phenotypic data, obtained via metabolomics (an-
alytical proﬁling of metabolites in biological samples.
Collaborators at Imperial College, London will carry
out the metabolomics work). The combination of these
techniques will provide an exciting new level of under-
standing of adaptation and potential evolution in natu-
ral populations exposed to environmental change, since
this may have major implications for the maintenance
of genetic diversity in populations, potentially facilitat-
ing future adaptive evolution.
The successful candidate would be working in a world-
class research environment with a team of specialists
in the ﬁelds of molecular ecology, conservation biol-
ogy, terrestrial ecotoxicology, and metabonomics. The
project will provide excellent experience in molecular
techniques in a modern, well-equipped laboratory, in-
cluding DNA sequencing, PCR, and DNA ﬁngerprint-
ing, plus many ecological techniques. The student will
gain experience in the application of these to investi-
gating ecological and environmental questions.
The studentship will be based at the University of
Glamorgan. The studentship is fully funded for a UK
student by the Leverhulme Trust. Applicants should
have, or expect to obtain at least a 2:1 honours degree
in a biological science, preferably with some experience
in population genetics or molecular ecology.

MPhil/PhD Research Studentship at the University of
Glamorgan Starting Autumn 2006 Faculty of Health,
Sport and Science - Department of Science and Sport
Background The Department of Science and Sport
(part of the newly created Faculty of Health, Sport and
Science) have a research studentship to oﬀer a suitable
candidate, in the area of molecular ecology.
Suitable candidates should be have an undergraduate
degree (at 2.1 or above) in an appropriate scientiﬁc sub-
ject, experience of working within a scientiﬁc labora-
tory environment, have excellent oral and written com-
munication skills, good organisational skills, be able to
work alone under the supervision of academic members
of staﬀ, and an awareness of health and safety issues
whilst working in the laboratory . The successful can-
didate will initially enrol on an MPhil/PhD programme
and will have the opportunity to progress to a full PhD
programme upon successful completion and transfer at
the end of the ﬁrst year on approval of the Faculty Re-
search Committee.
Studentship will investigate the following project: To
study the UK colonisation by an invasive alien alga
species, Sargassum muticum (Japanese wire weed), to
the shoreline of the UK, in particular the South Wales
coast. The species is native to Japan and China, but
since its introduction to the UK (probably via bal-
last water in ships, or the shellﬁsh industry) in the
1970’s, the species has spread along the South Eng-
land coast. It has now taken hold in at least three
sites on the coast of Wales, where it dominates low
shores, resulting in the displacement of many native
UK species. The student will use molecular tech-
niques, such as DNA sequencing and microsatellites
markers, alongside phylogenetic analysis to identify in-
vasion routes, source populations and diversity in in-
vaded areas. The project will be in association with
the Countryside Council for Wales. (informal enquiries
to Dr Tim Johnson, or Dr Georgina Harper). Success-
ful candidates should have a ﬁrst degree (2.1 or above)
in an appropriate scientiﬁc subject, preferably in ge-
netics or Biology. Informal enquiries should be made to
Dr Georgina Harper (glharper@glam.ac.uk), or Dr Tim
Johnson (tpjohnso@glam.ac.uk). Applications and Ex-pressions of Interest Applications should be made for-
mally in writing to one of the above members of staﬀ

Two Doctoral positions available in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy and Biodiversity in the Zoological Museum at the
University of Zurich in Switzerland
The research group in Evolutionary Biology and
Biodiversity led by Professor Tony Wilson in
the Zoological Museum ( <http://www.unizh.ch/-
zoolmus >www.unizh.ch/zoolmus ) is seeking two well-
qualiﬁed and highly motivated doctoral candidates for
positions at the University of Zurich. These positions
are for three years, beginning in January 2007, with
a salary of 35-40,000 Swiss Francs. A Masters degree
or equivalent is a prerequisite for acceptance into the
Ph.D. program at the University of Zurich.
Our group concentrates on the role of sexual selection
in the speciation process. Integrating molecular phylo-
genetic, population genetic and functional genomic ap-
proaches, our work spans a broad temporal scale in an
eﬀort to derive testable hypotheses on the evolution of
taxonomic diversity. Over the past several years, our re-
search has concentrated on syngnathid ﬁshes (seahorses
and pipeﬁsh), a group of particular interest due to spe-
cialized morphological adaptations for male parental
care and female-dominated competition for access to
mates. Our work involves ongoing collaborations with
researchers in America, Europe and Australia.
The ﬁrst PhD candidate will be involved in a study
of the inﬂuence of fecundity selection on body size
variation in populations of Syngnathus pipeﬁsh. Re-
cent work indicates a positive association between am-
bient water temperature, body size and fecundity in
nearshore pipeﬁsh species. Using a common garden lab-
based approach, the student will investigate the role of
ambient water temperature on growth rates and devel-
opment times of captive-reared pipeﬁsh. At the same
time, high density temporal and spatial sampling will
clarify ﬁne-scale variation in body size and fecundity
variation in the wild. The candidate will also have theopportunity to explore the use of otolith measurements
for the aging of wild-caught pipeﬁsh, using lab-reared
animals of known age.
The second PhD student will investigate the impor-
tance of major histocompatibility (MH) gene variation
in mate choice and parasite resistance in Hippocam-
pus seahorses. MH genes play an important role in
the adaptive immune response and have been shown to
be important for mate choice in teleost ﬁshes. Recent
research has identiﬁed 20 unlinked MH loci in the com-
pact genome of Hippocampus abdominalis. The candi-
date will construct a genetic linkage map for a labora-
tory population of this species using a suite of 300 STR
loci and, using a BAC library, characterize the distri-
bution and variance of MH in the genome. These data
will be used in a series of mate choice experiments and
parasite trials led by two Masters students.
Our lab is equipped with three 5000L climate-controlled
aquarium facilities for the culture of populations of
Syngnathus and Hippocampus under controlled condi-
tions. Our laboratory facilities include a MJ Tetrad
PCR machine and an ABI 3100 sequencer, with access
to a high-throughput ABI 3730 48-capillary machine.
In addition, our Functional Genomics center ( <http:/-
/www.fgcz.unizh.ch/ >www.fgcz.unizh.ch ) oﬀers exten-
sive facilities for proteomics and bioinformatics. The
core bioinformatics facility of the University consists of
two 4 processor Opteron Servers and an 8 TB ﬁle sys-
tem capable of running all Unix-based bioinformatics
and phylogenetics software packages.
The University is one of the top comprehensive institu-
tions in Europe and the Zoological Museum is a center
of excellence in behavioural ecology, population genet-
ics and evolution. With a critical mass of researchers
in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
and the neighbouring Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology (ETH Zurich), Zurich oﬀers an exceptional aca-
demic environment for research and study.
Zurich is an international city of 350,000 located at the
heart of Europe, with world-class facilities for sport,
music and theatre. With its location at the head of
Lake Zurich and its proximity to the Swiss Alps, there
are incredible opportunities for sailing, skiing, hiking
and mountaineering in the region. For all of these rea-
sons, Zurich has been ranked the top city in the world
for quality of living.
Interested candidates should submit a Curriculum vitae
and statement of research interests, along with a list of
two references, by email or post to Rosemarie Keller,
Institute Secretary ( kellerro@zoolmus.unizh.ch ) by Oc-
tober 15, 2006. In your application package, please in-
dicate which of the two positions you are applying for.24 EvolDir October 1, 2006

PhD thesis in mathematical epidemiology/molecular
evolution of mobile DNA
Mobile DNA is DNA that can change its position within
a genome. It is an integral component of most bacterial
genomes, and also implicated in the spreading of drug
resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria. Why does
mobile DNA persist in genomes? On one hand, mo-
bile DNA may be a very eﬀective parasite, replicating
itself at the expense of its host. On the other hand,
mobile DNA can also have beneﬁcial eﬀects, such as
occasionally beneﬁcial mutations. An ongoing project
in our group aims at resolving the question why mo-
bile DNA is maintained in bacte-rial genomes. Despite
thirty years of debate, the question still has no con-
clusive answer. The availability of hundreds of com-
pletely sequenced bacterial genomes provides a unique
opportunity to remedy this situation. The project has
a bioinfor-matics and a mathematical modeling com-
ponent. We are searching for a Ph.D. student with
experience in the mathematical modeling of epidemio-
logical or popu-lation biological systems to work on this
project.
The Wagner lab at the University of Zurich studies
biological evolution on all levels of organization, from

/www.biochem.unizh.ch/wagner/.Lab members are a
group with very diverse backgrounds and research
projects, uniﬁed by their interests in evolution and /or

The successful candidate will have a strong background
in applied mathematics, especially mathematical biol-
ogy, with experience in the analysis of nonlinear dif-
ferential equations, stochastic systems, and numerical
analysis. For best considera-tion, a strong background
in biology is also desirable, as well as ﬂuency in a ma-
jor scripting language such as perl. We are looking
for an individual with a Masters Degree or equivalent,

dem-onstrated interests in problems of molecular evo-
lution. The working language in the laboratory is En-

UppsalaU EvolFuncGenomics
Graduate student position (Doktorand) at the Depart-
ment of Evolutionary Functional Genomics Uppsala
University http://www.genetik.uu.se/ One PhD po-
sition is available at the Department of Evolutionary
Functional Genomics at Uppsala University starting au-
tumn 2006. The department is part of the Evolution-
ary Biology Centre, EBC. A major focus of the depart-
ment is the genetic basis of plant adaptation, combin-
ing information on gene function from model organisms
with studies of variation in adaptive traits in diﬀerent
species. The aim is to identify genes that aﬀect varia-
tion in traits such as ﬂowering time and growth rhythm.
Our strategy is to integrate traditional ecological and
phylogeographic studies with genomics and population
genetics, at both theoretical and experimental levels.
The successful applicant will take part in a project on
evolutionary and functional genomics of adaptive traits
in Norway spruce (Picea abies). The timing of budset
in Norway spruce is a trait with high adaptive value.
The trait has been extensively studied in quantitative
genetic studies that have revealed a strong clinal vari-
ation and that a large part of the variation is under
genetic control. The aim of the present project is to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling bud set,
and to identify the genes that control the adaptive cli-
nal variation for this trait. The general strategy is to
combine functional studies of already identiﬁed candi-
date genes in Norway spruce and model species with
association mapping experiments on the same genes in
Norway spruce. Methods include gene expression stud-
ies, transformation of Norway spruce and Arabidop-
sis, analysis of DNA sequence variation, SNP genotyp-
ing and association mapping. The current project will
mainly focus on functional characterization of candi-
date genes through expression and transformation ex-
periments. The work will be conducted within a re-
search group of currently 5 persons with both national
(SLU) and international (Canada, Italy) cooperation.
We are looking for an applicant with a strong interest
in molecular plant biology and evolutionary genetics.
A Bachelor of Science or equivalent in molecular biol-
ogy, genomics, genetics or a related subject is required26 EvolDir October 1, 2006
and experience in molecular genetics (for example DNA
sequencing, QTL mapping, RNA work or plant trans-
formation) and bioinformatics is an advantage.
The application should include curriculum vitae, de-
gree certiﬁcate, references, a short description of the
applicant and his / her experience.

LundU SystematicBiol
Lund University announces the following vacancy:
UNIVERSITY LECTURER IN SYSTEMATIC
BOTANY: Evolutionary processes in cryptogams
at the Department of Ecology (Section for Plant Ecol-
ogy and Systematics)
Ref. no: 4478
Description: The Department of Ecology has more than
200 employees, of whom approximately 80 are PhD stu-
dents. The Department is comprised of six Sections,
including the Section for Plant Ecology and System-
atics, which represents a substantial part of the plant
research carried out within Lund University ( http://-
www.planteco.lu ). A number of lecturers within the
Section have recently retired or will retire within the
next few years. We are interested in recruiting an
enthusiastic plant systematist, with a research proﬁle
within the area of cryptogam evolutionary processes
and diversity, who will play a central role in the long-
term development of undergraduate teaching and PhD
supervision within the Section.Job description: The position is full-time and the du-
ties of the lecturer will include research, undergrad-
uate and graduate teaching, supervision of PhD stu-
dents and administration. We would like to appoint
a lecturer whose research lies within the subject area
of cryptogam evolution and diversity. Approximately
half of the lecturer’s time will be devoted to teach-
ing (in both Swedish and English) and half to re-
search/administration. Teaching duties and the bal-
ance between teaching and other activities may vary
over time. The lecturer will initially be expected to
contribute to basic undergraduate courses in systematic
botany (including both angiosperm and cryptogam sys-
tematics), to advanced undergraduate/Masters courses
in cryptogam biology and plant evolution/biodiversity,
and to courses for graduate students. The lecturer’s re-
search should focus on mosses, lichens or ferns and the
evolutionary processes that are involved in diﬀerentia-
tion between populations and species. Topics of partic-
ular interest include gene diversity/gene ﬂow and phy-
logeography / phylogeny. Experience of research col-
laboration with ecologists will be regarded as a merit.
Because the Science Faculty in Lund has limited re-
sources for research funding, the successful applicant
will be expected to seek external funding to cover their
research costs and at least 25% of their salary.
Qualiﬁcations: Applicants should have a PhD in
systematic botany or within a comparable subject,
with a high level of competence in cryptogam biol-
ogy/systematics. They should have good postdoctoral
scientiﬁc merits - as a minimum “Docent-competence”
or postdoctoral experience commensurate with Swedish
docent-competence (a strong postdoctoral portfolio of
research and publication).
The successful applicant will have a well-developed re-
search record. She/he should be a competent and en-
thusiastic teacher, with appropriate pedagogical train-
ing and experience of course planning and course ad-
ministration. Experience of supervising graduate stu-
dents is a requirement. We especially value the ability
of the applicant to ﬁnance their research with exter-
nal funds, attract co-workers and successfully cooper-
ate with other scientists and national and international
teachers. The lecturer will be expected to be able to
teach in Swedish (alternatively in Danish or Norwegian)
within one year of taking up her/his appointment.
The qualiﬁcations required for appointment to the po-
sition of university lecturer are a doctoral degree, or
equivalent scientiﬁc qualiﬁcations, and pedagogic qual-
iﬁcations (as speciﬁed in Chapter 4, paragraph 7 of the
Higher Education Ordinance). In the appointment of
lecturers and professors, the same attention will be paid
to pedagogic as to other qualiﬁcations. The UniversityOctober 1, 2006 EvolDir 33
Board has decided that, to be appointed for a perma-
nent (without time-limit) position as university lecturer
or professor, the applicant must have undergone a uni-
versity pedagogical education of at least ﬁve weeks - or
in other ways have acquired comparable competence.
Applicants are thus urged to describe and document
their teaching experience thoroughly.
The basis for the assessment of qualiﬁcations in
the appointment of university teachers is laid out
in Chapter 4 of the Higher Education Ordinance
(SFS 1998:1003). (An English translation can be
found at: http://utbildning.regeringen.se/inenglish/-
pdf/heo jan03.pdf ) The Faculty Board’s recommen-
dations as to how applicants should present their
pedagogical qualiﬁcations are available at http://-
www.naturvetenskap.lu.se/o.o.i.s/2319 or can be ob-
tained from The Faculty Oﬃce, Margareta Millestam,
PO Box 118, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden, or E-mail: Mar-
gareta.Millestam@kanslin.lu.se.
Those who have not previously held a position as a uni-
versity lecturer may initially be subject to a one-year
probationary period of employment.

www.naturalis.nl/vacature or below in plain text.
The Netherlands National Museum of Natural History
in Leiden was established in 1820 and is known to the
general public as Naturalis since 1998. Naturalis cu-
rates about 15 million specimens of animals, fossils,
minerals and rocks. The museum’s collection are par-
ticularly rich in material from the Netherlands and ad-
jacent areas, Southeast Asia, the Netherlands Antilles
and Suriname; other highlights are geological collec-
tions from Spain, reptiles and amphibians from the
Amazon Basin and Lake Victoria cichlids. The 140
tenured staﬀ includes 21 research scientists. Researchat Naturalis has a wide scope, ranging from coral reef
biodiversity to gemmology, and research closely inter-
acts with the collection. The Associate Director is as-
sisted in the management of the sector by the heads of
the departments of Geology, Zoology and Entomology.
The museum is closely co-operating with other orga-
nizations in the Netherlands and abroad. Merging of
Stichting Naturalis with several other large biodiversity
collection and research facilities into the Netherlands
Centre for Biodiversity Research (NCB) is foreseen in
the near future. The NCB will become the national
collection and research organization for systematic bi-
ology and geology, with more than 50 scientists and c.
40 million specimens.
Naturalis seeks applicants for the position of Associate
Director of Research (full-time), who will set the agenda
of scientiﬁc research at Naturalis, to guide its devel-
opment and implementation, and to ensure signiﬁcant
external funding together with the three departmental
heads. The candidate should be able to position the

entiﬁc and governmental circles as well as in front of
a general audience; * An aﬃnity with the other main
activities of Naturalis (collection management, exhibi-
tions, university teaching and other educational pro-
grammes); * The ability to ’build bridges’, thus encour-
aging scientists to work together in innovative ways,34 EvolDir October 1, 2006
and leading to a more eﬀective collaboration among sci-
entists, managers and non-governmental organisations;
* The resourcefulness to contribute to the general man-
agement of Naturalis.
Naturalis oﬀers a competitive salary commensurate

SouthAfrica Volunteers
SmallMammalEvol
Please forward the following advertisement to all that
might be interested Succulent Karoo Research Station
in South Africa:
Volunteers as ﬁeld assistants needed:
Field assistants needed for the project:
Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Whereas the research is
mainly non-invasive, this is no job for extreme animal
right persons (we take tissue and blood samples).
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and
6 o‘ clock), and stops its activity with dusk. Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
ﬁeld will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
500 (around 75 Euro) must be paid for accommodation
at the research station. Students must buy their own
food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 1300 or 200
Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect topay about 300-400 Euros per month.
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
When and how long: One position gets available in Jan-
uary 2007 and more open positions from February to
December 2007. Volunteers should stay for a minimum
of 2 months and up to six months.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to info@stripedmouse.com.

UCaliforniaRiverside LabAssist
Lab Assistantship: I am seeking a lab assistant who
is interested in starting in the immediate future. The
position is part of an NSF sponsored research program,
is available for up to three years and pays from $2,200to $2,600 per month, depending on experience. This
position is ideal for someone who has just ﬁnished a
bachelors or masters degree and is looking for an ap-
pointment of a year or more while deciding what the
next step in your career will be.
The assistant will manage a ﬁsh lab in which we are
maintaining breeding populations of 20 species of ﬁsh
in the family Poeciliidae. Responsibilities will include
maintaining lab stocks, maintaining ongoing experi-
ments, managing a team of undergraduates who assist
in lab maintenance and interacting with graduate stu-
dents and the PI in the execution of experiments. The
assistant will also be encouraged to join in general lab
activities with the large and highly interactive graduate
group associated with this research program.
We are investigating the evolution of placentas in this
family. We have found that the functional equivalent
of a placenta has evolved at least six times within the
family. There are often close relatives that either lack
a placenta or have a placenta in intermediate stages of
development. The lab work on live ﬁsh includes gener-
ating descriptions of the life histories of the ﬁsh and exe-
cuting experiments that characterize the consequences
of having a placenta. Other facets of the project in-
clude molecular phylogenetics, ﬁeld research and the
description of life histories based on the dissection of
ﬁeld-collected ﬁsh, and preliminary studies of the genes
that underlie the evolution of the placenta.
Please submit a CV and the names and contact infor-
mation for three referees to:

Project Summary: An unanswered question in biology
is how do complex traits evolve?. This question endures
as an area of controversy because of a paucity of em-
pirical evidence and because the process unfolds on a
time scale that is far longer than human experience. We
propose developing a model system for the evolution of
complexity by studying the evolution of the placenta
in the ﬁsh subfamily Poeciliinae. This group of ﬁsh
oﬀers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
complexity because placental adaptation exhibits: 1)
dynamic variation: placentas appear to have evolved
ﬁve or more times in the family, 2) serial variation:
in several cases, closely related species exhibit either
no placentas, intermediate stages, or highly developed
placentas, and 3) quantitative variation: an objective
criterion for pre- versus post-fertilization maternal pro-October 1, 2006 EvolDir 43
visioning exists which provides an index of placental
performance. Furthermore, these ﬁsh are readily reared
and bred in captivity, are easily studied in nature, and
have an excellent prior history as subjects in labora-
tory and ﬁeld studies. Here we will use a combination
of molecular and morphological systematics to deﬁne
relationships within the subfamily and the relation of
the subfamily to the remainder of its order. We will
describe the life histories of these ﬁsh so that we can
combine life history and phylogeny data, then apply
statistical methods that will allow us to infer the pat-
terns of evolution of life histories in the subfamily. We
will also use these methods to develop hypotheses for
how and why the placenta evolved. Finally, we propose
a series of laboratory experiments that test predictions
and assumptions derived from recently developed the-
ory for the evolution of placentas.

tionary theory is available at the University of Pots-
dam (close to Berlin/Germany). The position will
start on 1 December 2006 and forms part of the Marie
Curie Transfer of Knowledge Project FEMMES (FEed-
back Mechanisms in Models for Ecological forecastS).
FEMMES aims to develop innovative models that de-
scribe how dynamic feedbacks between diﬀerent hierar-
chical levels (from genotypes to communities) aﬀect the
response of ecological systems to environmental change.
The project will run over a period of 4 years, comprises
a total of ﬁve positions for visiting scientists, and is
jointly hosted by the Department of Plant Ecology and
Nature Conservation, and the Department of Ecology
and Ecosystem Modelling.
The visiting fellow will be based at the Department
of Plant Ecology and Nature Conservation, a research
group with broad experience in the development of
individual-based and spatially-explicit ecological mod-
els (e.g. Grimm et al. 2005 Science 310: 987-991).
In collaboration with host scientists and a FEMMES
Postdoc, the fellow will develop a concept for incorpo-
rating feedbacks between the dynamics of populations
and genotypes into such process-based ecological mod-
els. Details of the research to be conducted at Potsdam
are open to discussion and should be linked to previ-
ous experiences and current research interests of the
fellow and the host. Ongoing research projects of the
host combine theoretical and empirical work on the re-
sponse of genotypes, populations, species and commu-
nities to habitat fragmentation, the ecology and evolu-
tion of invasive plant species, the ecological dynamics
of populations and species under climate change, and
the spread of transgenes in populations of crop plants
and trees (see also http://home.wtal.de/koechy/AG/-
index.html ).
Applicants should have at least 10 years of research ex-
perience, should be non-German, and should not have
resided in Germany for more than 1 year during the
past 3 years. Germans are eligible if they have resided
outside the EU for at least four of the last ﬁve years
(for details see http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/-
mariecurie-actions/action/knowledge en.html ). Appli-
cants should be ﬂuent in English, but knowledge of Ger-man is not required. Salary is in accordance with the

Adaptation to a Changing World: Molecular Evidence
for Selective Mortality in Walleye Pollock Larvae PIs:
Lorenz Hauser (School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sci-
ences, University of Washington) Mike Canino, Kevin
Bailey (Alaska Fisheries Science Center, NOAA, Seat-
tle, WA) Funding: North Paciﬁc Research Board
Background The impacts of climate change are an is-
sue of global concern, especially where ecosystems or
species are already stressed due to anthropogenic inﬂu-
ences. Exploited ﬁsh stocks may be particularly vulner-able to climate change as slight changes in larval and
juvenile survival may aﬀect recruitment and subsequent
stock biomass. Mortality rates are typically very high
during sensitive periods in the early life history stages of
many ﬁsh species, and may greatly aﬀect the strength
of the resulting year class. However, despite a general
understanding of environmental eﬀects on year class
strength, it is still unknown whether larval and juvenile
mortality are entirely random, or whether speciﬁc geno-
types are favored under certain conditions. Here, we
will use modern techniques of population genomics to
assess the extent of selective mortality during early lar-
val stages of walleye pollock. Speciﬁcally, we will assess
the relative success of diﬀerent genotypes by estimating
temporal and spatial genetic diﬀerentiation in two years
with contrasting environmental conditions, in particu-
lar temperature. We will identify molecular markers
under selection that can be used to (i) estimate selec-
tion coeﬃcients, (ii) assess the scope for adaptation to
changing climates, and (iii) estimate rates of exchange
between pollock populations in diﬀerent ecosystems.
Job Description The research technician will be ex-
pected to carry out AFLP (ampliﬁed fragment length
polymorphism) surveys on pollock larvae already
collected by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center.
Speciﬁcally, the duties would include optimization and
routine implementation of DNA extraction, restriction,
ligation, PCR and fragment scoring on a MegaBace1000
automated sequences. Experience with molecular lab-
oratory work is therefore essential, preferably with
AFLP markers. A good BS degree in biology or related
disciplines is required, and an MS degree is desired.
As part of a large research group (Marine Molecular
Biology Laboratory, <http://depts.washington.edu/-
mmbl/ >http://depts.washington.edu/mmbl/ ), the
successful candidate is expected to work well in a team
and to collaborate closely with the PI and the existing
laboratory technician on the project. For more infor-
mation on research projects in Dr Hauser’s group see

is initially funded for 18 month at a salary range
of up to $3,500 / month plus beneﬁts depending on
qualiﬁcations.

the importance of using local provenance seed in plant
biodiversity restoration
The project: The rehabilitation of diverse plant com-
munities following disturbance is an increasingly impor-
tant enterprise nationally. Best practice recognises the
importance of using local seed but accurate guidelines
deﬁning appropriate seed transfer zones and an assess-
ment of the consequences of using non-local seed, are
lacking. For key species, we will (i) utilise molecular
tools and landscape genetic analysis to delineate local
seed transfer zones, (ii) compare the ecophysiological
performance of local and non-local genotypes through
ﬁeld and glasshouse trials, and (iii) assess the conse-
quences of mating between local and non-local geno-
types. Working with restoration practitioners will en-
sure a more eﬀective restoration industry. Applicants
must have a PhD or equivalent in a relevant ﬁeld in
plant biology.
This project bridges the research disciplines of ecolog-
ical genetics, restoration ecology and ecophysiology to
address the critical issue of seed sourcing for ecolog-
ical restoration of degraded landscapes. A focus on
novel research opportunities, practical outcomes from
research and strong linkages with industry are features
of this project, with support and participation from

AncientDNA PVPP
Hi, I have some 500 year old ﬁsh bones that I want to
recover DNA from and judging by the colour of them
(dark brown) they’re likely to be pretty full of humic
acid. I was thinking of adding PVPP to the extraction
buﬀer to bind the humic acid, prior to concentrating
the DNA with a column (ie centricon 10kD) and then
cleaning it up with a Qiagen kit (QIAamp Micro kit or
Dneasy). I know that PVPP is often used to clean up
soil samples but has anyone tried it with bones or teeth,
or can comment on this approach generally. Thanks in
advance for any help you can give. Regards, Bill

Barbarea vulgaris samples
Can you help us? We are searching for seeds or leaf
material of Barbarea vulgaris from its European range.We are especially interested in material from Scandi-
navia, but also from central and southern Europe.
The material will be used for a study of population
structure. In Denmark we ﬁnd populations that are
mostly resistant or non-resistant to herbivory from a
Phyllotreta beetle, and in the present project we want
to test if the resistant populations have a diﬀerent evo-
lutionary history and range than the non-resistant. The
project is part of a larger Danish - Dutch collaborative
study on the plant - insect interactions.

Genetic Distance from
Microsatellites
Question for the readers of EvolDir
I am examining phylogeographic and population ge-
netic structure between populations of sailﬁn molly
ﬁshes that range throughout the Yucatan peninsula
of Mexico. I am interested in comparing the pattern
of neutral genetic divergence (based on allelic vari-
ation at nine microsatellite loci) to that of popula-
tion divergence in morphological traits (Mahalonobis
distance) and mating behaviors (principal components
and Euclidian distance). My question is: which is the
most appropriate genetic distance measure to compute
based upon my microsatellite data to use in Mantel and
spatial autocorrelation comparisons of genetic distance
with morphological or behavioral distance? Thanks for
any suggestions as to which type of genetic distance
(e.g., Nei’s, DA, chord, etc.) would be best for these
types of analyses and why. Please email responses to

Halocyprididae samples
Dear colleagues: I will start my MSc thesis at the Sta-
tion Biologique de Roscoﬀ, in France, building a molec-
ular phylogeny of pelagic ostracods (Myodocopa: Halo-
cyprididae) under the supervision of Drs. Colomban de
Vargas and Martin Angel.
I have got some material from the Sargasso Sea to start
with, but I would like to gather more material especially
from the Indian and Paciﬁc Oceans (but also from other
parts of the Atlantic), and from diﬀerent depths.
I would greatly appreciate if you have plankton sam-
ples preserved in EtOH (suitable for DNA analyses) to
share with me. I can sort the ostracods out of the sam-
ples and send the samples back, and of course preserved
specimens would be even greater.
Your help will allow analyzing most of the worldwide
diversity, which would be a great beneﬁt for my work.
If you have samples to share, we could work on a pro-
tocol to send them to Roscoﬀ, and we will provide a
Fedex account # so that no cost is involved on your
side,
Thanks a lot for your help and please dont hesitate to
contact me for any question,

quences (USS), a class of very abundant re-
peated sequences in bacterial genomes. You can

sus here: http://rrresearch.blogspot.com/2006/09/-

generating aligned sets of about 1000 sequences, usually
about 40bp long, and we’d like to use a program to lookOctober 1, 2006 EvolDir 59
for evidence of sites that are correlated in their evolu-
tion. We were thinking a program that calculates levels
of linkage disequilibrium or is able to identify compen-
satory substitutions (as would be done when analyzing
the evolution of RNA molecules) would be most appro-
priate. We’re hoping that an evoldir reader will be able
to point us to a suitable program for this analysis (Mac
or Unix preferred).

MJ PTC-200 ThermalCyclers
Our lab has recently purchased 3 ABI 9700 duel block
thermal cyclers. All of our pervious pcr’s have been
done on MJ PTC-200 thermal cyclers. We were hop-
ing that conditions would not change between the two
machines but of course that is not the case. The ABI
machines seem to be less intense and sometimes even
nonexistent when run side by side. The ramping rates
are both 1/sec. Does anyone know of a standard change
in program (i.e. 5 more cycles for the ABIs) or anything
else we could try?

on the same density curves? I cant ﬁgure this out since
the priors in Msvar are just ﬁgures, how do I generate
or get the prior distribution. I would be very grateful
if someone could help me do this in BOA for R. I am

PAML dNdS
Dear EvolDir members,
I work on complete genome of two species with 70% of
homology in amino acid. Some people say that I’m at
the limit to use PAML and that I may have substitu-
tion saturation. I work with the 3.15 PAML version
(novembre 2005). I ﬁrst run a pairwise analysis run-
mode = -2 (because I run 2 aligned sequences at once).
I run about six thousand pair of aligned sequences (but
one pair at once). Unfortunatly, I found a very high dS
value ( >50) for the main part of my sequences. So, the
results have no real meaning. I try with runmode =
2 (autmoatic analysis) to test diﬀerent model of evolu-
tion (NSsites). I run PAML wih NSsites = 2 (selection
model, M2a). I obtained some results but I don’t un-
derstand what they represent. For example I obtained
at the end of the main output ﬁle :
“stage 0: (1, 2); lnL(ntime: 2 np: 7): -1079.894991
3..1 3..2 19.54493 19.55404 7.33163 -0.20254 -1.62772
0.00344 37.70754”
Is some one abble to tell me what represent the dif-
ferent values ? Could you help me to understand the
PAML results ? Maybe I use the bad parameters ?

Sequence concatenation
Hello all:62 EvolDir October 1, 2006
I have several multiple sequence alignments that I need
to concatenate. Because each one is around 1000-1500
nucleotides in length using a word processor would be
a very laborious option. Does anyone out in Evol-dir-
land know of a reasonably eﬃcient program or protocol
for doing this? I1ve been poking around in MacVector
and GeneDoc without any real success. Any help would
be greatly appreciated.

Sequence concatenation answers
Greetings:
Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply
to my recent posting asking for programs or meth-
ods for concatenating multiple sequence alignments into
one overall alignment. Several individuals asked that
I share the results of my query regarding concatenat-
ing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). First and
foremost, many reminded me to make sure that the
sequences in each MSA were in the same order (i.e.,
if MSA one contained sequences from Human, Chimp,
Mouse, and Chicken in that order, the sequence in all
other MSAs had to be in the order Human, Chimp,
Mouse, Chicken). Second, for several of the most eﬃ-
cient methods to work, the sequences in the diﬀerent
MSAs need to have the same sequence ID as most of
the programs use this information to match and stitch
together the sequences.
The most common and generally simplest recommen-
dation was to append each MSA one below the other
in one ﬁle and then input this into PHYLIP or PAUP
as interleaved sequence. For PAUP (and MacClade and
Mesquite and MrBayes) this will require that the ﬁle be
a nexus-format ﬁle. For PHYLIP the ﬁle will need to
be in the standard PHYLIP format. With this method
the program will concatenate the sequences in the pro-
cess of reading them into the analytical pipeline. PAUP
and MacClade (and possibly Mesquite?) can then ex-
port the processed input ﬁle as sequential data and in
several formats.
Another sequence analysis program recommended byseveral responses was DAMBE, which has a concate-
nation function among its features. DAMBE can
be downloaded from http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/-
software.asp . DAMBE is a Windows program, but pre-
sumably it can work in an emulator (Virtual PC) or
virtual machine (Parallels desktop).
Still more individuals recommended using a Perl script
and/or Perl and BioPerl modules to perform the con-
catenation. If one is running Mac OS X then perl is an
available option.
Another interesting alternative was to use Excel. One
can open the alignment ﬁle as text so that the sequences
are in individual cells. Though not absolutely required
the individual MSAs can then be copied and pasted into
one spreadsheet. Then the function concatenate() can
be used to concatenate the cells with the appropriate se-
quences. While it1s not necessary to have the sequences
in the MSAs in the same order with this method it
would be much easier to implement if they were.
Other programs mentioned that can perform con-
catenation were ProSeq v 3.0 (latest develop-
ment version can be downloaded from http:/-
/helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/evolgen/ﬁlatov/proseq.html ), the
bioinformatics workbenches CLC Gene, Protein, and
Combined (fully functional demos available from
http://www.clbio.com ), Genious (7-day trial available
from http://www.genious.com ), the Se-Al alignment
editor ( available from http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/-
software.html?id=seal ), and the BioEdit Windows

Software Arlequin ver 3 1
Please note that a new version (3.1) of Arlequin is now
available on
http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin3 Compared
to version 3.01, Arlequin 3.1 includes several cosmetic
and speed improvements, as well as bug corrections and
additional features:
Improvements ———— * Locus-by-locus AMOVA can
now be performed independently from conventional
AMOVA. This can lead to faster computations for large
sample sizes and large number of population samples. *
Faster routines to handle long DNA sequences or large
number of microsatellites. * Faster reading of input
ﬁle. * Faster computation of demographic parameters
from mismatch distribution. Improved convergence of
least-square ﬁtting algorithm.
Additions: ———- * Computations of population spe-
ciﬁc inbreeding coeﬃcients and estimation of their sig-
niﬁcance level. * Output of the number of alleles as
well as observed and expected heterozygosity per lo-
cus for all populations. * Computation of the Garza-
Williamson statistic for MICROSAT data. * New sec-
tions are provided at the end of the result ﬁle, in order
to report summary statistics computed for each pop-
ulation: - Basic properties of the samples (size, no.
of loci, etc...) - Heterozygosity per locus - Number
of alleles + total no. of alleles over all pops - Allelic
range + total allelic range over all pops (for microsatel-
lite data) - Garza-Williamson index (for microsatellite
data) - Number of segregating sites, + total over all
pops - Molecular diversity indices (theta values) - Neu-
trality tests summary statistics and p-values - Demo-
graphic parameters estimated from the mismatch dis-
tribution and p-values. * New shortcuts are provided
in the left pane of the html result ﬁle for F-statistics
bootstrap conﬁdence intervals, population speciﬁc FIS,
and summary of intra-population statistics.
Bug corrections: —————- 1. Locus-by-locus
AMOVA failed for on DNA sequences when corrections
for multiple hits were selected. These corrections havebeen di 2. File conversion towards the Phylip format
could not be done. 3. It was impossible to change the
default signiﬁcance level of 0.05 for highlighting signif-
icant genetic distances in output ﬁle. 4. Missing data
identiﬁer other than “?” was not accepted. 5. If a
a project ﬁle (or the path to it) contained the letters
“arb”, then it was erroneously considered as a Batch
ﬁle. 6. Reported conﬁdence interval around FST were
badly reported by the bootstrap procedure in case of
a single group and no Individual Level taken into ac-
count. 7. Estimation of haplotype frequencies from
distance matrix was not performed when “Conventional
FST” option was selected. 8. Locus-by-locus AMOVA
reported incorrect results for Genotypic data when in-
dividuals had missing data for only one of their gene
copy at a given locus. 9. Reported number of indels
diﬀered according to the weight given to indels in the
Option panel. This bug did not aﬀect AMOVA com-
putations. 10. For sequence data, a mixture of N’s
and missing data led to problems in identifying dis-
tinct DNA sequences from distance matrix, leading to
slightly incorrect FST computations. 11. Exact test of
population diﬀerentiation could not be performed when
gametic phase was unknown. Now, this option has been
restored, like in ver. 2. 12. Arlequin hanged when a
given population was entered several times in the deﬁni-

Now, the error is simply ﬂagged but the program does
not hang. 13. For frequency data, it was impossible
to use a predeﬁned distance matrix. 14. Beta approx-
imation of the signiﬁcance of Tajima’s D gave wrong
results. This approximation has been suppressed and
now we only report the signiﬁcance level obtained from
coalescent 15. Bad computation of inbreeding coeﬃ-
cients under the locus-by-locus AMOVA approach for
genotypic data when phenotype frequencies were larger
than one. The bug caused an overestimation of the lo-
cal (FIS) and total (FIT) inbreeding level. For samples
where phenotype frequencies were all set to 1, the in-
breeding coeﬃcients were correctly estimated. 16. Ex-
pected heterozygosity reported under HWE exact test
section was inaccurately computed. This inaccuracy
however did not aﬀect the results of the HWE exact
test, which does not use information on observed and
expected heterozygosity.

TeachingEvol ComputerPrograms
Dear Colleagues,
Would any of you know of computer programs that
could be used for demonstrating experimental evolu-
tion to students, programs in which one can manip-
ulate for example the strength of selection pressures,
degree of genetic drift (eﬀective population size; pop-
ulation structure, dispersal rates), mating system (not
necessarily), and mutation rates ? Preferably a graphi-
cal program that would make it easy for students to use
and give easily interpretable outputs (graphs of frequen-
cies of various morphs as a function of time, population
sizes etc.).
A search on the internet comes up either with references
to speciﬁc models used by researchers in the context of
their own work (testing speciﬁc hypotheses) or with
programs such as the popular-level (but neat) program
Darwin Pond (by J. Ventrella). Darwin Pond allows
changing a lot of parameters linked to the ﬁtness of
creatures (mating preferences, swim rates and turning
rates and hence dispersal capacities) and some of the
environmental characteristics (food distributions), but
does not allow setting directly the degree of genetic
drift, strength of selection etc.
Thanks very much in advance for any information,
Best regards,
Else Fjerdingstaf

microsat software distance answersThank you everyone for your answers and suggestions.
Here are the replies I got.

For topology reconstruction, Takezaki & Nei (1996)
suggest that in both the Inﬁnite Allele Model (IAM)
and Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM), Cavalli-Sforza
and Edwards (1967) chord distance and Nei et al. s
(1983) genetic distance are preferably chosen, while for
estimating branch lengths, (d µ)2may yield better re-
sults. I attached Takezaki & Nei’s paper to this email
for you.
With the ﬁtch-margoliash algorithm, implemented in
FITCH in PHYLIP, you can construct such a hybrid
tree, using e.g. Nei’s genetic distance for topology and
delte mu 2 for branch lengths.
I used to calculate delta mu 2 values in MSA.
Dieter.Anseeuw@kuleuven-kortrijk.be Unless your indi-
viduals are all of diﬀerent species they don’t have a
“phylogenetic relationsip”. Instead each locus has a
diﬀerent coalescent tree. By forcing them all to have
the same tree you are distorting the relationships.
You should look into programs like Migrate or IM. If
you’re thinking in terms of phylogenies of individuals
you should re-think the matter.

Depending on your sample size, you many be able to
use more appropriate methods for determining the rela-
tionships between populations. Phylogenetic methods
were developed for reciprocally monophyletic species
and should really not be applied to populations that
exchange genes. There are now some better meth-
ods to determine the relationships among populations.
Two packages that I have found quite useful are Struc-
ture ( http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/ structure.html)
and Population Graph ( http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu/-
wiki/index.php/Software).

delta mu square values can (as far as I know) only be
calculated with RSTCALC. There are however other
ways to conduct a phylogenetic analysis based on al-
lele frequency data, e.g. Nei’s genetic distance. I am
attaching a protocol I wrote for doing so. It involves
the following softwares “Convert”, “Phylip” and “Tree-
view”. All are available for free. Dr. Susanne66 EvolDir October 1, 2006

Try the AFC plots in the GENETIX (Belkir et al.)

partition variance instead. Yet, each individual will be
represented in a multi-vector space.

********
In the analysis of microsatellite loci, if the number of
loci examined is small, Da or chord distance should
work better than delta myu square to estimate the phy-
logenetic relationship of populations.
Previously, we have studied the probability of obtaininga correct tree by using Da, chord distance, delta myu
square, and some other distances for microsatellite loci
and showed that Da and chord distance work better
than delta myu square unless hundreds of loci are used
(Takezaki and Nei 1996). This is because even though
the value of delta myu square is expected to increase
linearly with time under the stepwise mutation model
that the microsatellite loci roughly follow, the sampling
error of the delta myu square is used.
More explanations about genetic distance and phyloge-
netic tree are found in chapter 13 of the book of Nei
and Kumar (2000). In this chapter,

r8s program problems
Dear colleagues,
I’m having problems with running the program r8s (by
Mike Sanderson) and would like to know if anyone can
help. I downloaded the program onto my PowerBook
G4 OS 10.3.9 and tried to run by double-clicking the r8s
binary executable. It seems to start alright, appearing
a ’r8s>’ on the terminal screen. However, when I try
to execute any ﬁle it doesn’t recognise it. It appears a
message saying “this is not a NEXUS ﬁle”. I’ve tried
also to run the data ﬁles provided in the package, but
the same message appears. Has any of you experienced
a similar problem and how did you manage to solve it?
Thanks a lot.

BrownU SeqRecognitionSites
The lab employs computational approaches to identify
and understand the role of individual sequence elements
in complex recognition events. In yeast, splice sites
are deﬁned by strong consensus sequences. Yet in ver-
tebrate genes these signals appear much weaker even
though the search space is much larger (bigger genomes,
bigger pre-mRNAs, more introns). The information
necessary for recognition appears to have migrated out-
side the sites and into the surrounding sequences. We
have identiﬁed subtle enhancer and silencer sequences
that appear to help explain this recognition event.
Main Goals: 1) identify functional variants using these
models and inferences of selection. 2) test the enhancer
activity of both version of the alleles in a high- through-
put system 3) implement computational methods in
multiple genomes to study the evolutionary history of
these elements
An ideal candidate will come with quality molecu-
lar, evolutionary or computational biology experience.
The types of assays used in this work may include:
PCR, RNA and DNA extraction, In-vitro RNA synthe-
sis, making constructs, hybridizations, electrophoresis
(horizontal agarose, vertical native and SDS page), and
maybe some Westerns. You don’t need to be an expert
in everything but you should have done most of these
things at least a few times.

Gif sur Yvette (France) to work on the evolutionary
biology of memory.
In Drosophila 4 diﬀerent memory phases have been de-
scribed (short-term, middle-term, anesthesia-resistant
and long-term). Using selection experiments, popula-
tions comparison and conditioning assays, we are ad-
dressing questions such as: what is the genetic diver-

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN ECO-EVO-DEVO
What are the developmental mechanisms that control
allometry? How do these mechanisms evolve? Recent
progress in developmental biology has shed new light on
the mechanisms that regulate body and organ size in
animals. How these mechanisms are integrated to con-
trol the scaling relationship between body and organ
size (allometry) is, however, unknown.
A Postdoctoral position is available to elucidate the
physiological and genetic mechanisms that regulate al-
lometry, as a prelude to understanding how allometries
evolve. The project will concentrate on the role nutri-
tion and the insulin-signaling pathway play in regulat-
ing the relationship between ﬁnal organ size and body
size in ﬂies (Shingleton et al. (2005), PLOS Biology 3
(9); Shingleton (2005), Current Biology 15 (20), R825-
R827). The research will involve molecular and physio-
logical techniques. The ideal candidate is therefore one
with a background in cell and molecular biology, devel-opmental genetics or insect physiology, with an strong
interest in integrative biology and evolution. The in-
dividual must be energetic and career-motivated, who
is able to work both independently and co-operatively
with a team. A Ph.D. degree is required.
The position is available immediately, and applications
will be considered until the position is ﬁlled. Salary is
on the NIH/NRSA pay scale and is commensurate with
experience. This position is limited to applicants who
are currently studying or working in the US or are a

ZEALAND
Landcare Research is a Crown Research Institute dedi-

We are seeking to ﬁll a 3 year postdoctoral position
to undertake research on the Royal Society of New
Zealand Marsden funded project ’Is parasite spillback
a cause of local extinction in native communities’.
This project will address the fundamental question of
whether the feedback of native parasites from intro-

using native freshwater ﬁsh communities and intro-
duced salmonids in New Zealand as a model system.
The postdoctoral researcher will join a project team

cal genetics. The project will involve handling large
SNP genotyping datasets, as well as other bioinformat-
ics skills. Working knowledge of basic molecular bio-
logical techniques is also required. Experience working
with Drosophila desired although not necessary. Ap-
plicants must have excellent written and oral commu-
nication skills, and the ability to author manuscripts
suitable for publication in top peer-reviewed journals.
The position has a ﬂexible start-date and is available

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION - ECOLOGY AND
EVOLUTION OF AVIAN DISEASE
A postdoctoral position is available in the Center for
Tropical Research, Institute of the Environment and
the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at
UCLA. We are seeking a broadly trained evolutionary
biologist with a strong background in the application
of molecular genetic techniques to diseases of natural
populations. The position is available for one year with
the possibility of renewal for a second. The position is
now open and applications will be accepted until the
position is ﬁlled.
The successful candidate will work as part of an in-
terdisciplinary team investigating the eﬀects of defor-
estation on the prevalence of blood-borne pathogens in
African rainforest birds. Using existing samples, as well
as collecting new ones, and using PCR-based detection
methods and molecular phylogenetics, the candidate
will work collaboratively to investigate how long-term
anthropogenic changes in habitats aﬀect the prevalence
of infectious diseases in natural populations. The three
main objectives of the study are to: 1) determine how
pathogen prevalence changes over time within diﬀer-
ing rainforest habitats, 2) determine host, habitat andvector speciﬁcities of blood-borne pathogens to explore
the degree of host-switching, and 3) determine, using
remote sensing and bioclimatic data, the environmen-
tal variables that best correlate with pathogen preva-
lence and develop models that will aid in the prediction
of how ecological change will aﬀect disease prevalence
and the likelihood of host switching.
The postdoctoral fellow will also have the opportunity
to explore broader questions related to population di-
versiﬁcation and microevolutionary processes. They
will be encouraged to interact and collaborate with
postdoctoral researchers and graduate students work-
ing on a broad range of ecological and evolutionary
projects. Other Center for Tropical Research projects
include: 1) investigations of the mechanisms of specia-
tion and diversiﬁcation of rainforest vertebrates, 2) ap-
proaches to identifying critical areas for conservation in
the tropics, 3) population structure, connectivity and
conservation of migrant birds, 4) studies of avian in-
ﬂuenza, and 5) seed dispersal and forest regeneration.

BIDOPSIS THALIANA
A 30 month postdoctoral position is available at the
University of Manchester (United Kingdom), to work
on QTL mapping using a large panel of recombinant
inbred lines derived from a heterogeneous stock of
Arabidopsis thaliana. This is a new and unique ge-
netic resource that will be used to dissect the genetics
of complex traits in this plant. Its analysis requires
the use of statistical techniques originally developed
for mouse QTL analysis (for more details see http:/-
/gscan.well.ox.ac.uk/ ), and the postholder will be re-
sponsible for converting such methods to this project.
The project is a collaboration between Dr. Paula Kover
(Manchester), Prof. Richard Mott and Dr William Val-
dar (Oxford). While the position is based in Manch-
ester, the postdoc will spend part of his/her tenure in
the Welcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Ox-
ford.
Candidates should have a PhD in QTL mapping, statis-
tical genetics or statistics. Good computational skills
are essential. A background in quantitative genetics ap-
plications would be an advantage, but exceptional can-
didates wishing to move into the genetics ﬁeld are also
welcome to apply. Salary will be in the range £26,000
depending on experience.
Applicants should send a copy of current CV, a let-
ter indicating your reasons for applying, a brief state-
ment of research interests, and the name and contact in-
formation of three referees to kover@manchester.ac.uk.
Review of applications will begin on Sept. 30th, and
will continue until a suitable candidate has been found.
While start date is somewhat ﬂexible, it should be no
later than Jan 31st 2007.

Montpellier ESF ExperimentalPops
Dec7-9
Dear all,
An ESF ConGen workshop on “Experimental metapop-
ulations” will take place on December 7-9 2006, Mont-
pellier France (arrival on December 6th, departure on
December 10th). A list of the invited speakers is given
below. There is room for a dozen of contributed talks
and 10-20 posters. Anyone interested in participating82 EvolDir October 1, 2006
(with or without giving a talk) should apply to the or-
ganizing commitee.
Most species live in fragmented habitats, and many are
threatened by fragmentation. The ecological and evolu-
tionary consequences of fragmentation have motivated
the ﬂourishing of metapopulation theoretical studies,
with little empirical testing, partly because of the diﬃ-
culty of manipulating metapopulations in nature. Ar-
tiﬁcial or semi-natural metapopulations may help over-
come some of these diﬃculties and may provide pow-
erful tools to evaluate our understanding of evolution-
ary and ecological processes in spatially structured sys-
tems. The main rationale for this workshop is our be-
lief that experimental simple systems will help to over-
come many diﬃculties encountered in empirical stud-
ies of metapopulations, will increase our understanding
of metapopulation biology and help testing the theory.
We wish to encourage the development of manipulative
empirical studies in the ﬁeld of metapopulation biol-
ogy. One of the prime aim of this workshop would be
to foster the development of new projects in this area.
ESF funds in part travel and accomodation for speak-
ers. Priority will be given to researchers working in one
of the participating countries of ConGen (see http://-
www.usc.es/congresos/esf05/index.html ) and to young
researchers. We wish to keep the workshop relatively
small, with a maximum of 50 participants.
People interested should contact us with information
regarding 1) whether they want to give a talk, or a
poster, 2) the title and summary for their talk if appli-
cable, 3) a short CV, 4) their estimated travel cost. We
wish that participants stay for the whole duration of the
workshop (from 9 am on the 7th to 6 pm on the 9th of
December). Send all information before September 22

Funded by the Volkswagen Foundation
Dates: 27 November ˆ a 1 December 2006 Venue: Evan-
gelische Akademie Tutzing, near Munich, Germany
The rapid addition of modern molecular techniques to
the evolutionary ecologistˆ as toolbox has been paralleled
by the extensive development of sophisticated stastisti-
cal methods with which to decipher evolutionary pro-
cesses in natural populations. This workshop aims to
introduce empirical evolutionary ecologists at the pre-
and post-doctoral level to these modern inference tech-
niques. The workshop is organised around several re-
search themes, each of which will be presented by an ex-
pert in the ﬁeld. Emphasis will be placed on concepts,
interconnections and applications rather than mathe-
matical ﬁnesse. This guided tour should enable the
participants to identify the best approaches for their
own budding or ongoing projects and aid the design ofOctober 1, 2006 EvolDir 83
future research. Ideally the participants will be encour-
aged to further their own understanding of these meth-
ods and/or to recruit a theoretician to their project.
The workshop language will be English.
Each day of the workshop consists of lectures, discus-
sion groups and hands-on exercises and will be devoted
to one of the following research themes:

change it later, for now we just want to have an idea
about your subject). Priority will be given to applicants
who come from countries that ﬁnancially support the
ConGen programme (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Nether-
lands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Turkey).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
