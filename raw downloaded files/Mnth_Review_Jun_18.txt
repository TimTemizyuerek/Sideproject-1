The Organising Committee
Gregor Gorjanc and John Hickey
*Biography*
Robin Thompson is a pioneering leader in the elds of
statistics, quantitative genetics and animal and plant
breeding. He started his career in Edinburgh in the
late 1960's in the then Agricultural Research Council
Unit of Statistics, later moving to the Animal Breeding
Research Organisation, which ultimately became part
of the Roslin Institute. He remained there until the mid
1990's when he moved to the Institute of Arable Crops
Research at Rothamsted as the head of the prestigious
department of statistics, established by R.A. Fisher,
that laid the foundation for much of modern statistics.
In the 1970's, while based at the University of Edinburgh,
Robin and Desmond Patterson proposed and developed
a new statistical method which came to be called REML.
It now dominates in several elds including statistics, ge-
netics, breeding, and eld trial analysis. Data collected
in many real-life settings are inherently unbalanced and
REML provides optimized statistical methodology for
such data. The foundation paper from 1971, \Recovery
of inter-block information when block sizes are unequal"
is a citation classic with more than 3,700 citations to10 EvolDir June 1, 2018
date. These days, REML is implemented in most widely
used statistical analysis packages.
In addition to inventing REML, Robin has made signi-
cant contributions to the development of computation-
ally ecient algorithms to facilitate the application of
REML to large datasets. Of these, the most important
is the Average Information algorithm, developed in the
1990s. Robin, together with Arthur Gilmour, developed
a *versatile and ecient*software package called AS-
Reml that is the most widely used in animal and plant
breeding across the globe today.
Robin has made a broad range of contributions to the
development of rigorous science underpinning UK and
global animal and plant breeding programmes. His col-
laborations with the various Edinburgh groups had, and
continue to have, particular impact in UK dairy, beef
and sheep breeding.
Finally, Robin has made a major input to post-graduate
education in Edinburgh. For many years, he taught
components of the MSc in Animal Breeding and Quan-
titative Genetics. He was a formal supervisor of more
than twenty research students and an informal mentor
of many more. Robin has been incredibly generous with
his ideas to both students and established researchers.
Several of his former students now have high interna-
tional reputations.

The eld of population genetics has a remarkable tra-
dition of being a tight-knit and nurturing community.
In order to continue to foster that sense of community
for popgen groups in the Midwest, we are organizing
the fth annual Midwest PopGen conference. https://-
mwpg2018.wordpress.com/ The location and date this
year will be The University of Minnesota - St Paul Cam-
pus on August 24th-25th. The meeting will begin Friday
at noon and continue to Saturday evening with a BBQ
on Friday evening, and an opportunity to check out the
state fair on saturday night!
We will select talks from submitted abstracts to balance
the topics, career stage etc of the presenters. There
will be a poster session (anyone can give a poster, no
abstract needed). The meeting will be trainee-oriented,
so students and postdocs are especially encouraged topresent their work. There will be prizes awarded for
best poster and best talk by a student and postdoc.
If you would like to give an oral presentation, submit
your abstracts by June 22nd. Submitters will be notied
if their abstract is chosen for a talk by July 1st.
*Registration is free,* [link
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/-
1aRmrzw3cjykAVWrQyATUPXxbQZyPo7PVZZNmRaakMD8/-
please RSVP by Aug 3rd (June 22nd for talk sub-
missions) by adding your name and information to
the registration list ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/-
1aRmrzw3cjykAVWrQyATUPXxbQZyPo7PVZZNmRaakMD8/-
).
*Additional notes* *- The meeting overlaps with the
state fair.* This should be very fun (and was part of
the reason that we chose this date) but adds a degree
of diculty to meeting logistics. Look for a place to
stay soon (we are soliciting twin cities folks interested
to put people up), and plan on taking public transport.
*- The meeting follows a FREE symposium on machine
learning* on august 23rd (in the same location) with
speakers including Casey Greene, Katie Pollard, and
Dan Schrider. Come early for the fun! We also have
one open speaker slot for that meeting so contact Yaniv
if you would like to present at that meeting. We hope
to pair people up with a place to stay, so locals should
let us know how many people they can host, and out-
of-towners should let us know if they are looking for a
place.
Additional info / details / schedule etc will be made
available on https://mwpg2018.wordpress.com/ ybrand-

Auckland PlantPathogenEvolution
PhD position in Plant Pathogen Evolution Massey Uni-
versity Auckland, New Zealand
A PhD scholarship is available to pursue a doctoral
degree on the evolution of a bacterial plant pathogen.
The project is based at the New Zealand Institute forAdvanced Studies, Massey University (Albany campus,
NZ).
The student will participate in a Marsden funded project
'Population Genomics of an Emergent Plant Infectious
Disease'. Disease emergence is a growing threat to
agricultural productivity and food security worldwide,
identifying the source and evolutionary processes in-
volved in the emergence of crop disease is therefore of
fundamental importance. We use recurring outbreaks
of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae on kiwifruitJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 13
as a model system for investigating how agricultural
pathogens emerge from the wild, how coevolutionary dy-
namics shape pathogen virulence and host immunity in
natural and cultivated populations, and the genetic basis
of host specicity and pathogen transitions to agroe-
cosystems. The PhD student will acquire computational,
laboratory and eld experience in pathogen evolution,
population genomics and plant-microbe interactions.
Suitable candidates will have completed a Masters or
equivalent degree in microbiology, plant pathology, evo-
lutionary biology, ecology, genetics, plant biology, ge-
nomics or computer science. Candidates who have
demonstrated excellence in their Bachelors degree may
also be considered. Previous research experience or
training in microbiology is preferred.
How to apply: Send the following materials to Dr. Hon-
our McCann (h.mccann@massey.ac.nz) by May 31st,

index.php?id=917 Predators that eat toxic food
Supervisors: Hannah Rowland, Christian Paetz, MPI
for Chemical Ecology
Background: The evolution of warning colour patterns
in prey that have chemical defences is an important
area of research in evolutionary biology (1). Variability
in the colour patterns and chemical proles of prey is
frequently documented (2, 3). In comparison to vari-
ability in prey signals, variability in the predators that
respond to these signals has less often been considered
and, where it has, not directly quantied (4, 5). The
evolutionary dynamics of warning colour patterns will
depend on the extent of (genetic) variation both in prey
and in their predators (6-8). Where predators are capa-
ble of circumventing the chemical defences of prey, this
often involves the evolution of elaborate mechanisms for
avoiding(9), tolerating (10), or resistance to the toxic
eects of the defence (11).
Project Description: This aim of this project is to un-
derstand the molecular and physiological mechanisms
that underpin avian predator's ability to feed on chemi-
cally defended prey. You will conduct feeding studies
to determine the eect of chemical defences (positive or
negative) on predator behaviour and physiology. You
will use transcription proling to detect up-regulated
genes associated with defence consumption, and also
investigate the fate of chemical defences after ingestion
in order to identify potential detoxication mechanisms
and to detect possible metabolites. There is the poten-
tial to move toward In vitro enzyme/receptor assays.
Candidate prole: We are searching for a highly moti-
vated student with a scientic, and curiosity-driven atti-
tude and a strong interest in interdisciplinary research
combining molecular biology, chemistry, and ecology.
Excellent communication skills and prociency in writ-
ten and spoken English is required. A background in bio-
chemistry and/or molecular biology is preferable. Expe-
rience with one of more method of transcriptomics/cell
culture/ HPLC or liquid chromatography coupled with
mass spectrometry (LCMS-MS) would be desirable, but
not absolutely necessary (training will be given).

Graduate position (M.S.): Evolution of animal commu-
nication at Murray State University (KY)
Note: Funding opportunities have recently become avail-
able (see below). To be considered for a TAship and/or
the biodiversity stipend, application should be submit-
ted to me by 5/24/18.
The Beckers' Lab at Murray State University accepts a
Masters student who is interested in the evolution of an-
imal communication starting in the fall of 2018.Our lab
uses Orthopterans (i.e., katydids, and crickets) as model
organisms to address questions pertaining the evolution
of animal behavior. More specically, we study the ef-
fects of the environment (i.e., phenotypic plasticity) on
mating songs. In our main study species, Neoconephalus
triops, day length induces two substantially dierent
mating songs. These dierences in the songs are com-
parable to species dierences within the genus. In a
collaboration with two other labs (Missouri and West
Virginia), we study the genetic underpinnings of this
behavioral plasticity and how the involved genes related
to speciation within the genus.
A second line of research focuses on the evolutionary
arms race between katydid hosts and their eavesdrop-
ping parasites in the local population of N. triops.The
ies use the katydid mating songs to nd their hosts and
deposit deadly larvae on them. Thus, sexual selection
and natural selection act in opposing directions on male
singing behavior. The evolutionary ramications of this
deadly parasitism on male singing and mate acquisition
behavior are the focus of future studies.
I seek driven, enthusiastic, and focused students to join
my lab at Murray State University. Successful appli-
cants have a B.S. in biology, ecology, or related discipline
and are interested in studying animal behavior and evo-
lution. If you are interested in this opportunity and/or
have any questions, please email Dr. Beckers at obeck-
ers@murraystate.edu. For your application, make sure
to address in an attached document your research inter-
ests, how they relate to the Beckers' lab research, and
your GPA.
Funding for tuition and a summer stipend are avail-June 1, 2018 EvolDir 15

PhD Scholarship: Disease genomics of two New Zealand
nsh species We are seeking a highly motivated PhD
student to be part of a group to investigate the disease
genomics of the New Zealand snapper (Chrysophrys
auratus) and trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus).

people/sbird Aquaculture is the fastest growing
food-production sector and New Zealand has the
potential to develop a range of locally grown n-
sh species to meet this increasing demand. New
genomics-based selective breeding programs are needed
to help develop recently domesticated sh species
into premium products. Plant and Food Research
(http://www.plantandfood.co.nz) is known worldwide
for its innovative breeding and genomics research, and
it is leading the development of New Zealand seafood
genomics.This PhD project will involve working alongside a group
of experienced researchers to study the genomes of the
New Zealand snapper and trevally to identify and char-
acterize immune genes, screen for genome-wide disease
markers using a pedigree from domesticated populations,
evaluate the bacterial disease metacommunities and
conduct gene expression analyses using transcriptomics
and qPCR. This will involve using high-throughput
sequencing approaches, coupled with automated and
error-reduced phenotyping. The overall goal is to char-
acterize the immune systems of both sh species to
better understand disease resistance in domesticated
populations, facilitating a rapid and ecient selective
breeding programme.
PhD Project Aims 1. Use whole genome assemblies and
transcriptomes to identify immune genes and pathways,
2. Use genomic information to improve detection of
novel disease QTLs, 3. Assess stress and disease re-
sistance of hatchery individuals, and understand their
bacterial disease communities.
This PhD project will provide an excellent opportunity
to learn the latest interdisciplinary technologies and
apply them to sh genomics. The PhD student will
gain experience working in academic, government and
private sector institutions. They will be a member of a
highly active and collaborative group of researchers, and
help develop new technological approaches and applied-
genomic tools.
The successful candidate will be a highly motivated
researcher with a strong background in computational
approaches in biology or computer science. Data analy-
sis of next generation sequencing data will be the main
workload of the project. Therefore, knowledge and expe-
rience of a scripting language (Python/Perl) is needed.
A proven ability and motivation to write research papers
is a plus.
Students will be enrolled at the University of
Auckland but primarily based in Nelson (http://-
www.nelsonnz.com). We will provide a three-year schol-
arship that provides a stipend and university (domestic-
level) fees. This project is supported by the MBIE grant
'Enhancing production of New Zealand's seafood sector
using accelerated breeding techniques'.
Applicants should send a CV, a statement of their re-

UAberdeen EvolutionArchaea
Funded PhD studentship in microbial evolution at the
University of Aberdeen (Scotland, UK): 'Experimental
evolution of Thaumarchaeota' The fundamental aim
of this project is to determine the process of adaptive
diversication and associated trade-os in tness, by
studying microbial evolution experimentally.
A 4-year PhD studentship in microbial evolution, start-
ing in October 2018, is now open for application at the
University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The deadline
for applications is June 5th 2018 and this studentship
is available to students of any nationality (providing
funding for tuition fees and stipend). The PhD project
is funded by the Royal Society and will target key evo-
lutionary questions with a special focus on Thaumar-
chaeota to align with the research thematic of the Uni-
versity of Aberdeen Nitrication Group.
Using microbes to test theory in evolutionary biology
has led to major scientic advances. In particular, micro-
bial experimental evolution has allowed analysis of both
microbial adaptation (genomic and phenotypic changes)
and diversication (phenotypic evolution and lineage-
splitting) using controlled environments, through in-
creased understanding of the nature and frequency of
genomic substitutions, their eects on microbial tness
and the mechanisms by which diversity is created and
maintained in microbial populations. These concepts
were established from studies of bacteria, fungi, viruses
and phage, focussing mainly on a few bacterial model
organisms (1, 2). However, an entire domain of life,
the Archaea (3), has largely been ignored by evolution-
ary biologists, despite their widespread distribution in
natural environments, high abundance and essential con-
tribution to global ecosystem functioning that sustains
the planet. A priori, no clear reasons for dierent evo-
lutionary processes between archaea and bacteria can
be advanced, but their ancient evolutionary divergence
(despite the existence of lateral gene transfer between
domains) suggests that the relevance of established mi-
crobial models of adaptation and diversication should
be tested on these organisms if they are to be considered
universal. Indeed, despite the global importance and
diversity of archaea, our understanding of the ecological
and evolutionary processes generating their high diver-
sity is scarce compared to that of eukaryotes and, to a
lesser extent, bacteria.This project will focus on members of a key microbial
phylum, the Thaumarchaeota (4, 5), which are abundant
and ubiquitous and perform a critical ecosystem func-
tion, ammonia oxidation. The distribution of natural
microbial communities is inuenced by environmental
characteristics, and pH is the major abiotic factor in-
uencing extant thaumarchaeotal niche specialisation
(4), and has also inuenced their diversication and
patterns of lineage formation through deep evolutionary
time (5).
This project will involve re-isolation of a thaumarchaeo-
tal strain (6) followed by the study the evolution of these
microbes experimentally. Experimental evolution will
be performed in automated mini-bioreactors by impos-
ing environmental changes under controlled conditions
and the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation and
diversication as well as the existence of trade-os will
be determined using genomic and tness changes over
time.
The PhD student will join a dynamic team of re-
searchers led by Dr C ecile Gubry-Rangin (https://-
www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/people/proles/c.rangin) and will
benet from the presence of strong groups in the de-
partment working on related topics as well as being
embedded in a strong network of international collabo-
rations. The University of Aberdeen provides an excel-
lent scientic environment, state-of-the-art technological
support facilities and diverse training opportunities for
all aspects of research and for transferable academic and
generic skills.
Candidate should have (or expected to achieve) a mini-
mum of 2:1 Honours degree, ideally (but not required)
an MSc in evolution, ecology or related, strong theoret-
ical skills and enthusiasm for learning and developing
microbial experimental evolution.

The study at the genomic level of adaptations that or-
ganisms have to environment is a fundamental topic in
evolutionary biology. Thanks to the great advance of
techniques and genomic tools in recent years, this type
of approaches is progressing rapidly and have opened
the possibility of addressing new questions about how
genetic changes result in adaptive changes in the pheno-
types. These same technological advances have made
possible the inclusion in this eld study of wild species,
that are ecologically well characterized and/or possess
relevant characteristics.
The project aims the development and use of genomic
tools in the European hoopoe (Upupa epops). In this
species of bird has been described a defensive symbiosis
with bacteria living in its uropigial gland. In addition,
the study of the genome of this bird species has an added
interest, since it has a peculiar karyotype within birds,
with a signicantly higher number of chromosomes com-
pared to the rest of avian species.
-Candidate requisites: The interested person should have
a Bachelor or University Degree in Life Sciences, Statis-
tics or related elds. We are looking for a person with
the capacity to work as a team, responsible, proactive
and oriented to results.
- Tasks to be carried out: - Fine tuning of the sampling
technique. - Participation in the sampling in the eld. -Preparation of samples for sequencing. - Bioinformatic
analysis of the data from the sequencing of the samples.
(Illumina, PacBios). In this rst phase, the data will be
mainly gene expression (possibly RNA-seq).
- Merits to be considered - Possess or be studying a
Master in Bioinformatics or related. - Good academic
record to have real possibilities of getting a PhD-student
position. - Experience in Unix/Linux environment and
in the Bash shell. - Knowledge of programming lan-
guages such as R, Python or Perl. - Knowledge of
genome analysis pipelines (eg, FastQC, BWA, Bowtie,
GATK, SAMtools, TopHat2, STAR, etc) would be an
advantage. - Experience in the basic techniques used in
the molecular ecology laboratory (extraction of DNA /
RNA, electrophoresis, PCR, etc ' ^A') would be an ad-
vantage. - Experience in eld work with wild animals
would be a plus. - Good level of English.

EvolutionSexDetermination
PhD POSITION : EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY/BIO-
INFORMATICS
The position :
The Breton lab (University of Montreal) is looking for
an ambitious and highly motivated PhD student in-
terested in understanding the genetic and epigenetic
mechanisms of sex determination in the marine mussel
Mytilus edulis.
PROJECT : The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is the most
important cultured mollusc and therefore a major eco-
nomic driver in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Fisheries
and Oceans Canada), and one of the most important in
the world. Once successful in southern North Carolina,
M. edulis has undergone a worrying decline in recent
years in the Atlantic Provinces and the United States.
Dierent hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
reasons for this decline: overexploitation, ocean acid-
ication, pollution, diseases, increased predators and
global warming. Notably, global warming has been used
as a hypothesis in several other studies to explain the
decline of blue mussel populations, a result that could
be attributable, among other things, to a drastic change
in the sex ratio (i.e. the ratio of males and females),
which could jeopardize the viability of certain popula-
tions. Indeed, marine mussels and oysters are known to
have a sex ratio regulated by the environment (temper-
ature and/or food). However, unlike oysters, very few
studies have focused on sex determination mechanisms
in marine mussels. A major reason for studying sexual
determinism in mussels relates to their economic and
nutritional importance. It is widely accepted that the
success of livestock operations is largely related to the
characteristics of the breeding populations (natural or
captive), and in particular the need to control sex ratios,
reproduction periods, fecundity and fertility.
This FRQNT-funded project aims to better understand
the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of sex deter-
mination in Mytilus edulis. Therefore, the successful
applicant should have experience or a strong interest
in bioinformatics, evolutionary biology and molecular
biology.
Funding (15K/yr) is available to support the success-
ful candidate for three years in addition to a limited26 EvolDir June 1, 2018
travel budget. Expected start date is September 2018 or
January 2019. The Universite de Montreal is a French
language institution where graduate work may be un-
dertaken in English or French.
Interested students should contact
s.breton@umontreal.ca and attach a CV, academic
transcript, contact details of two academic referees, and
a brief description of their research interests.
The position will remain open until a suitable candidate
is found.
Please note that only those selected for an interview
(Skype or telephone) will be contacted. Preference will
be given to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.

Ecology and food safety in shellsh production.
Climate change and anthropogenic pressures may have
dramatic eects on marine ecosystems with strong neg-
ative impacts on sheries and aquaculture as the spread
of emerging pathogens and the modication in distri-
bution and balance among bacterial species. Vibrio
spp. represent the majority of the marine and estuarine
biomass. Several studies demonstrated the spread of
Vibrio cholerae in many regions, including Italy, where
cholera outbreaks have never been reported. Changes
in environmental bacterial communities may aect host-
microbiota interactions and mutualistic symbiotic re-
lationships, causing potential adverse eects on the
physiological state of animals, growth performance and
product safety and quality. This research topic aims to
explore biodiversity in microbial ecosystems, focusing
on Vibrio populations, in order to elucidate the complex
dynamic interactions between molluscs and their mi-
crobiota. Culture-dependent and culture-independent
methods will be applied on two dierent shellsh species,
Crassostrea cigas and Ruditapes philippinarum, to eval-
uate the composition of bacterial community focusing
on Vibrio populations. In addition dierent methods
of shellsh depuration will be also assessed. All these
data will be integrated with environmental and animal
health parameters in order to develop dynamic models
providing useful forecasts to farmers and authorities
involved in food safety controls.

date in Computational Genetics in the research group
of~Arjan Carlborg.
The selected candidate will be oered a full time four
year employment at Uppsala University. The position
comes with salary and full benets of being a Swedish
University employee. Up to 20% teaching can be
requested annually, in which case the position will be
prolonged to ve years. The PhD program includes
a total of 30 credits (20 weeks) of courses, a few
obligatory and most optional, the rest of the program is
own research. More information on the PhD program
can be found at http://www.imbim.uu.se/Education/-
Postgraduate+education/information-and-documents/
.The starting date is exible, but the initial plan is for
admission during the fall semester of 2018. Review of
applications will start immediately and will continue
until a suitable candidate has been found.
The research group focus on studying the genetics
of complex traits with a particular emphasis on non-
additive genetic inheritance in polygenic genetic archi-
tectures. An interdisciplinary, interspecies approach is
used, where new genetic models, statistical methods,
and bioinformatics approaches are developed to explore
experimental data from a range of species - from yeast
to plants and domestic animals. We always attempt to
make use of the most powerful experimental data avail-
able and therefore obtain it from a variety of sources
including public repositories, collaborators or by gen-
erating it ourselves. This PhD-student project is an
important part in this eort and will be performed in
this strong, inter-disciplinary research environment. You
can nd more information about our group at http://-
katalog.uu.se/organisation/?orgId=X38:50 . During the
studies, the PhD candidate will have full access to state
of art computing resources and training programs pro-
vided by SciLife & Uppsala University. Limited travel
funding for attending conference and summer schools
are available within the program.
The rst half (2 years) of this PhD project is to work
with the Virginia lines - a chicken population developed
during a long-term (60 year) bi-directional, single-traitselection experiment. This is an excellent model to
study the genetic basis of long-term selection response
on an adaptive trait that is highly polygenic. Earlier
work has shown that selection has acted on a complex
genetic architecture including loci with either tightly
linked adaptive variants, multiple segregating haplo-
types and/or interactions between loci. The PhD stu-
dent will be involved in eorts to map and model the
genetic architectures of the adaptive trait in and its
contributions to the long-term selection responses. A
valuable resource to the project is a new dataset in-
cluding approximately 4000 phenotyped, pedigreed and
individually low-coverage sequenced individuals from a
19 generation deep advanced intercross line between the
divergently selected lines. The later half (2 years) of the
project will be decided depending on the interest and
competence of the admitted PhD student, and could
therefore involve, for example, detailed explorations of
specic genetic mechanisms via analyses of data from
other species or data simulations, or more focus on de-
velopment of new models and methods for trait mapping
or modeling of genotype-to-phenotype mappings.
Qualications MSc in Bioinformatics, Statistics, Compu-
tational biology, Quantitative/Population/Evolutionary
genetics or similar qualications is a requirement. If the
degree is not complete at the deadline of applications, it
should be indicated when it is estimated to be obtained.
Given the analytical content of the project, it is a merit
to have good knowledge and experience of both genetics
and informatics. This can be shown through earlier
research experience in the eld. Programming is an
important tool in the project and therefore you should
have experience in programming in e.g. R, C++, For-
tran, Perl, Python or Java. You should have excellent
English abilities, both orally and in writing. If you are a
mathematician/statistician/computer scientist, comple-
mentary knowledge in genetics or genomics is meriting.
Knowledge in mathematics/statistics/computer science
is in the same way meriting if your exam is in biology.
The letter of interest, including a description of your for-
mal qualications together with any questions about the
PhD project, should be directed to Prof. ~Arjan Carlborg,
Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology,
Uppsala University; orjan.carlborg@imbim.uu.se.

conducted within the Human Evolution Program at the
Department of Organismal Biology (Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Center, Uppsala University). The G unther group
is specically studying the prehistory of humans in Eu-
rope and the genomic history of animal domestication
while developing and improving population genomic
and bioinformatic methods to analyze palaeogenomic
data. The Human Evolution Program, in which the
G unther group is situated, has a broad interest in pop-
ulation genetics and human evolution. There are ample
opportunities to work closely with postdocs and other
PhD students who focus on related projects. The re-

*Project description: *Obtaining ancient DNA from
prehistoric remains has opened up the time dimension
for genetic research by allowing us to study populations
across time and space. The student will analyze such
data to study the evolutionary history of prehistoric do-
mesticated animal (e.g. sheep) and human populations.
While genomic studies on prehistoric human popula-
tions can complement results from other disciplines (e.g.
archaeology, linguistics), animal domestication is a great
model for evolutionary changes in a relatively short time
frame and under strong selection pressures. Particular
focus of the project will be on the development of pop-
ulation structure over time and how selection shaped
the genomes of these populations. In addition to the
analysis of published and newly generated datasets, the
student will test and extend computational methods for
working with such data.
*Requirements: *A Masters degree (or equivalent) in a
relevant eld is required. The ideal candidate is highly
motivated with thorough education and strong inter-est in evolutionary genetics/genomics, population ge-
netics and bioinformatics. Previous experience with
large-scale genetic data analysis, ancient DNA, and
scripting/programming is advantageous. Mathematical,
computational and statistical training is also advanta-
geous. Candidates must be uent in English.
In lling this position, the university aims to recruit the
person who, in the combined evaluation of competence,
skills and documented qualications, is judged most suit-
able to carry out and develop the work-in-hand and to
contribute to a positive development of the department.
The PhD-student position is a 4-year appointment, and

Dear all
Sorry for possible cross posting. Please distribute as
appropriate.
This is to inform you about a PhD project on \Microevo-June 1, 2018 EvolDir 29
lution on macroevolution islands: Does phylogenetic iso-
lation of trees from neighbors trigger rapid phenotypic
responses in phytophages?". The project is one out of 5
for in our research unit competing for 3 fundings.
The PROJECT: Evolution may operate very rapidly,
in particular on oceanic islands were colonizers are re-
leased from natural enemies and competitors and face
genetic drift. However, islands are only a small part
of the earth's surface. Individual plants, in particular
mature trees, are distinct host patches for phytophages.
Plants of dierent species often grow in close spatial
proximity but may nevertheless belong to lineages sep-
arated by many million years of macroevolutionary
history. Just like oceanic islands, such \macroevo-
lutionary island trees" might hence be characterized
by fast trait evolution of their insect phytophages.
M*a*croevolutionary islandness of host trees might trig-
ger m*i*croevolutionary responses in phytophages. In
short, in this we try to understand whether a small event
in tree macroevolution - a tree converges and coexists
with distantly related neighbors - changes the pheno-
types of its insect colonizers, including their capacity to
respond to climate change.
The host lab here is the UNITE MIXTE DE
RECHERCHE (UMR) ECOBIO - ECOSYSTEMES,
BIODIVERSITE, EVOLUTION, co-funded by Univer-
sity of Rennes 1 and Centre National de la Recherche
Scientique, with particular expertise in mechanisms
of speciation, life history evolution, and adaptation,
expertise at the interface between macroevolution and
macroecology, expertise in ecophysiology, landscape ecol-
ogy and behavioral ecology, environmental genomics
(very strong), community assembly and plant/herbivore
interactions. It is a large institution with several dozen
CNRS-researchers, docents and professors, plus (some)
technical sta. See http://ecobio.univ-rennes1.fr/ . It
was ranked A in the national evaluation of research insti-
tutions. Several further research institutions in ecology
and evolutionary biology exist at Rennes.
RENNES has approximately 200 000 inhabitants and
is the capitol of the Bretagne region with excep-
tional coastal and mainland landscapes, and a french-
celtic heritage (http://www.bretagne.fr/internet/jcms/-
TF071112 5061/tourisme ). It is situated some 1.5
hours by train from Paris. English is spoken every-
where in Academia, but not necessarily outside, and
French should be learned. Like in any French city, child
care is excellent (almost for free, no waiting list, nearby).
Several bilingual French-English schools are available at
all levels of education, as well as one French-German
grammar school.
Formal deadline is June/3 at https://theses.u-bretagneloire.fr/egaal/theses-2018 . **If interested,
please directly contact me directly at least a week before

* Exploring the impact and adaptation to social and
environmental stress in the king penguin *
supervised by Dr Jean-Patrice Robin and Dr Pierre Bize
at the University of Strasbourg, France
King penguins are unique by their biology: they repro-
duce in an aggressive social environment and extreme
environmental conditions, and parents alternate long
fasting periods on land with intense foraging periods
at sea. Furthermore, both sexes display conspicuous
ornaments used in sexual and social contexts. We have
previously demonstrated that king penguins are sen-
sitive to their neighbours: breeders get stressed when
reproducing in socially dense environments and they
rely on the size of their auricular patch to establish
social dominance. In this project, we aim to explore
further inter-individual physiological and behavioural
variation in responses to social stress, and in particular30 EvolDir June 1, 2018
to test whether some individuals are better adapted to
cope with social stress, what make them better adapted
to stress and whether individuals can signal their so-
cial competences. Research will be carried on the Sub-
Antarctic Island Crozet, and the applicant should have
a keen interest in doing experimental work in free living
birds and to embrace an integrative approach, address-
ing changes in states ranging from the cell to the whole
organism level. This project will rely both on newly
data collected by the candidate in the eld over up to
2 expeditions in sub-Antarctica and on archived data,
thereby allowing the candidate to start the PhD project
without delay and guarantying results on the project.
For this PhD project we are seeking somebody who is
independent, mobile, creative, highly motivated, and
has interest in animal physiology and behavioural and
evolutionary ecology. Our ideal candidate has previ-
ous experience working in the eld (preferentially with
birds), likes working in a team, has excellent written and
oral communication skills in English, and is not afraid
of statistics and lab work. Experience with programing
in R (or other languages such as SQML or Matlab) and
with lab work is not essential but is a welcome addition;
the willingness to learn such techniques is, however,
crucial.
The successful applicant will be mainly based in the
Department of Ecology, Physiology & Ethology (DEPE)
at the University of Strasbourg, France, under the
joined supervision of Dr Jean-Patrice Robin (Stras-
bourg) and Dr Pierre Bize (University of Aberdeen,
UK). The DEPE is a lively Department where the
student will benet from interaction with a thriving
community of postgraduate students, postdocs and re-
searchers in animal physiology, marine biology and be-
havioural ecology. Furthermore, the student will inte-
grate an international team working on the French Polar
Program ^A^AECOENERGY ^A^A, and will thus benet
from the interaction and support of research partners,
namely Vincent Viblanc and Yves Handrich (Stras-
bourg, France), Quentin Schull (MARBEC, France),
Antoine Stier (Turku Univ., Finland), Steve Dobson
(Auburn Univ, U.S.A.) and Rudy Boonstra (Toronto
Univ., Canada). The student will be encouraged to visit
the partners to conduct specic analysis. The student
will participate in the PhD program of the Doctoral
School ED414 of the University of Strasbourg (http:/-
/ed.vie-sante.unistra.fr/) providing additional learning
of transferable skills.
Strasbourg is one of Europe ^A^As most attractive cities.
It has a rich historical and architectural heritage, with
Strasbourg's historical city centre being listed as a World
Heritage Site by UNESCO. Its human size, its pedes-
trian city centre and 500 km of cycling paths make it avery pleasant city to wander around. Vibrant and aord-
able, Strasbourg is a true student city providing a great
learning and living environment (Check out the New
York Time's video: https://www.nytimes.com/video/-

USunshineCoast HumanGenomics
Human Genomics PhD Scholarship at the University of
the Sunshine Coast, Australia
Humans migrated out-of-Africa over 60,000 years ago
and spread to dierent parts of the globe. In this process
human population was subsampled serially along the
routes of the migration. This project will investigate the
footprints of migrations manifested in the frequencies
and patterns of genetic variations in human populations.
The main research foci of our group include the eects
of genetic drift in modulating mutation and selection,
quantifying mutational load, investigating the rates and
patterns of mutations, estimating divergence times be-
tween species and populations and ancient genomics.
We work on a number of species including humans and
other mammals, birds and oysters.June 1, 2018 EvolDir 31
The current project focuses on a) investigating genetic
relationships and gene ow between global human pop-
ulations. b) estimating the mutational load in humans
c) understanding the unique patterns of genetic vari-
ations in dierent human populations. All the above
objectives will need to be examined in the context of
human migrations out of Africa.
This project involves collecting samples for whole
genome sequencing and performing a series of bioin-
formatic analyses to process raw sequence data. The
processed data will need to be analysed using a range
of methods in population genomics and evolutionary
biology to answer the questions related to objectives
mentioned above.
The project provides an opportunity to work and ac-
quire knowledge in inter-disciplinary sciences such as
molecular biology, genetics, computer science and statis-
tics.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Academic qualications - An
honours or master's degree in biological, physical or com-
putational sciences is highly preferred; however, persons
with a non-biology degree should have some basic un-
derstanding of genetics, evolution and molecular biology

UVienna ChemicalEcology
Evolution
The Division of Tropical Ecology and Animal Biodiver-
sity at the University of Vienna, Austria is seeking a
highly-motivated MSc student to study the detoxica-
tion strategy of the cabbage stem weevil Ceutorhynchus
pallidactylus to overcome the chemical defenses in its
crucifer (Brassicaceae) host plants.
Background Weevils of the genus Ceutorhynchus feed
exclusively on crucifers (Brassicaceae), although these
plants evolved a strong phytochemical defense system to
prevent being eaten by herbivores. Upon feeding dam-
age, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by B-thioglucosidase
enzymes (myrosinases) to form isothiocyanates well
known for their toxicity for herbivorous insects. Few32 EvolDir June 1, 2018
groups of insects successful adapted to this so-called
'mustard oil bomb' and are specialized to feed on cru-
cifers. Cabbage-white butteries (Pieridae) use nitrile-
specier proteins to produce less toxic nitriles instead
of isothiocyanates upon glucosinolate hydrolysis. The
association of Pierinae butteries with their host plants
is a key example of Ehrlich and Raven's 'escape and
radiate' model of insect-plant coevolution. With over
400 species, the genus Ceutorhynchus represents by far
the largest insect radiation on Brassicaceae. It can
therefore be expected that Ceutorhynchus considerably
contributed to the 'arms-race' between insects and cru-
cifers. Their species richness further implies that these
beetles evolved an ecient strategy to overcome the
chemical defense in crucifers.
Goals To infer the adaptation of Ceutorhynchus species
to their crucifer hosts, feeding bioassays will be per-
formed with Ceutorhynchus pallidactylus and Arabidop-
sis thaliana, a plant containing 4-methylsulnylbutyl
glucosinolate. After ingestion of A. thaliana leaves, wee-
vil bodies and feces will be extracted in methanol and
the extracts analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The lab work will be
conducted in the Max Planck Institute for Chemical
Ecology (MPI-CE) in Jena, in collaboration with Dr.
Franziska Beran (Research Group Sequestration and
Detoxication in Insects).
Schedule Work may begin May 2018 or soon thereafter
and is scheduled for one year. Publication of results is
intended. The project is ideally suited as MSc thesis
work in the curricula Zoology or Ecology & Ecosystems
at the University of Vienna.

As research manager you will work closely together with
the station manager and both managers will share re-
sponsibilities. However, each will have specic main
duties, but should also be able to deal with all other
duties (for example when the other manager is on leave,
or when a new manager has to be trained). Our current
research manager will leave the project in October 2018.
The new research manager will be instructed by the
present research manager.
Skills needed: Good experience in eld work and good
knowledge of behavioural ecology or a similar eld of
research. Experiences in working with small mammals,
radio-tracking, blood sampling, living at a remote loca-
tion are of advantage.
You must be hard-working, highly motivated, able to
work independently, good in communicating with peo-
ple, able to supervise others, and not afraid of snakes.
You must have a drivers licence and you must love to
live at a remote place in nature, without regular internet
and cell-phone reception. Most importantly, you are
fascinated by nature and science!
Great opportunity: This is a great opportunity to spend
1.5-3 years in Africa, acquiring important skills in eld
biology and project management, while improving your
CV. These skills will become valuable whether you later
continue with a PhD or other jobs. It will be very hard
and demanding, but also a once in a life time experience!

Mandrillus Project - Information for Volunteers
Volunteer Field Assistant Positions
Role description
The Mandrillus Project is a non-prot organisation
aiming at longitudinally studying wild mandrills in
Southern Gabon. We are currently recruiting Volun-
teer Field Assistants for our 2018-2019 eld season.
These positions combine practical research with train-
ing and are entirely eld-based. The volunteers are
trained by and work alongside local eld assistants, eld
managers, sometimes students and researchers, con-
tributing to the research activities of the Mandrillus
Project. Following established protocols, the eldwork
will primarily involve daily follows of a natural pop-
ulation of mandrills on foot, collecting data on the
behaviour of individually recognisable animals, together
with the collection of non-invasive measurements and
samples. Please visit the website of the project to get
an idea of the scientic programs that are currently run-
ning (http://www.projetmandrillus.com/research-and-
conservation.html).
Positions available
Two Volunteer Field Assistant positions are currently
available, each running for six months from early-mid
September to late February / mid March.
What we cover
Once the volunteers arrive in the eld site, the Man-
drillus Project covers all their work-related costs, in-
cluding accommodation (private equipped room with
air-con and private bathroom, shared kitchen) and a
stipend for meals (about 200 ^A/month). The associa-
tion will also cover the costs of the volunteers' travel
insurance. On the successful completion of eldwork,
we also contribute a minimum of 150 ^A towards the cost
of the volunteers' travel fees.
Who are we looking for?
These positions are open to all with an interest in animal
behaviour and ecology . We are particularly keen to
hear from applicants who:
* Are friendly, easy-going people, happy to live in small
team at a remote eld site * Are strongly motivated,reliable, honest and committed * Have good levels of
physical tness and stamina - you will be following the
mandrills on foot several hours a day, 6 days per week,
over mountainous terrain, in heat * Show good initiative,
with a willingness to learn and show attention to detail
* French is a plus but not eliminatory
What do volunteers get out of it?
* An amazing opportunity to share the lives of wild
mandrills in an equatorial forest landscape * An oppor-
tunity to learn new skills and gain experience, especially
those relevant to research in behaviour and ecology *
An opportunity to be involved in a long-term project
on African wildlife, hosted by an international research
institution * An opportunity to use this eld experience
with the Mandrillus Project as a stepping stone on to
future Masters and PhD degree courses * Experience a
new culture and share knowledge with local assistants
Further information
For further details about these positions, including the
work involved, our living conditions in the eld, prepa-
rations prior to departure, and what to bring with you,
please see below (and additional information will be
provided to successful candidates).
How to apply
If you would like to apply, please prepare a CV and a de-
tailed covering letter that should explain why you would
like to work on the project. The CV should include the
names of two referees with e-mail contact details.
Applications must be sent at
marie.charpentier@umontpellier.fr by 5pm Tues-
day 19 June 2018 . We will notify successfully
shortlisted candidates until Wednesday 20 June,
and interviews will be held in Montpellier (for local
successful candidates) or by skype Friday 22 June .
Applicants should keep this date free for interview,
since no other dates will be available. Telephone/skype
interviews will be possible for overseas applicants.

The Study Site
Weather
Gabon has an Equatorial climate with little seasonality.
Precipitations are important, almost every day from
October to May, and days may be hot (up to 30 ^AoC),
although the Lekedi Park benets from a cooler weather
because of its altitude (600m). The long dry season,
from June to September, is characterized by cool weather
(temperatures can fall below 18 ^AoC) with no precipita-
tion.
LandscapeJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 53
The Lekedi Park is characterized by a mix of savannas
and gallery forests interspersed with rivers and riverbeds.
Equatorial Marantaceae forests are found in the area.
Wildlife
The Lekedi park is home to a variety of wildlife including
forest bualos, several Apes (chimpazees, gorillas) and
other primates (cephus, nictitans) and, of course, man-
drills! Predators include, occasionally, leopards (but
don't expect any encounter with them!). Birds and
reptiles also abound.

MolecularEcolPrize nominations
Nominations for Molecular Ecology Prize
We are soliciting nominations for the annual Molecular
Ecology Prize.
The eld of molecular ecology is young and inherently in-
terdisciplinary. As a consequence, research in molecular
ecology is not currently represented by a single scientic
society, so there is no body that actively promotes the
discipline or recognizes its pioneers. The editorial board
of the journal Molecular Ecology therefore created the
Molecular Ecology Prize in order to ll this void, and
recognize signicant contributions to this area of re-
search. The prize selection committee is independent of
the journal and its editorial board.
The prize will go to an outstanding scientist who has
made signicant contributions to Molecular Ecology.
These contributions would mostly be scientic, but the
door is open for other kinds of contributions that were
crucial to the development of the eld. The previouswinners are: Godfrey Hewitt, John Avise, Pierre Taber-
let, Harry Smith, Terry Burke, Josephine Pemberton,
Deborah Charlesworth, Craig Moritz, Laurent Excoer,
Johanna Schmitt, Fred Allendorf , Louis Bernatchez,
and Nancy Moran.
Please send your nomination with a short supporting
statement (no more than 250 words; longer submissions
will not be accepted) directly to Deborah Charlseworth
(Deborah.Charlesworth@ed.ac.uk) by Friday 29 June
2018.

Preprint service survey
Dear All
Some of us are thinking about starting a pre-print ser-
vice devoted to ecology and evolutionary biology. We'd
love to know what you think of this idea (good, bad, or
otherwise). So, if you can spare a minute, please take
our BRIEF survey: https://goo.gl/ZpJiPx If you don't
know what a pre-print is, please read below for more
info: Pre-prints are spreading rapidly in ecology and
evolutionary biology; the posting rate is doubling every
year (see: http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/-
are-preprints- future-biology-survival-guide-scientists).
Pre-prints are old news in physics but are new in most
other disciplines. Discipline-specic pre-print services
have emerged recently in elds ranging from biology,
geology, psychology, economics, and engineering. Right
now, most biology pre-prints are posted on a single site
(Biorxiv), but biology is a vast eld and it may make
sense to create dierent pre-print services for dierent
sub-elds.
So what is a pre-print and why would someone post one?
A typical pre-print is a manuscript posted by authors
prior to submission to a journal. In the short-term,
this allows for peer comments that can improve the
manuscript before formal peer review, provides early
exposure for the manuscript, establishes priority, and
provides an opportunity to garner citations before pub-
lication (a pre-print gets a doi). After publication, pre-
prints are still useful because a pre-print is available to
anyone, not just people who can get past a pay wall.
This open-access is not only desirable for maximum
visibility of the science, but is required by many fund-
ing bodies. Finally, pre-prints have become compatible
with later publication in a journal, as most prominentjournals, and a rapidly growing list of other journals,
accept manuscripts that are posted as pre-prints. Some
people would like pre-print services to ultimately replace
journals. Others see pre-prints as a useful addition to
the current publishing landscape. Either way, pre-prints
appear here to stay. We are considering helping to
found a pre-print service devoted to papers from ecology
and evolutionary biology. The rst step in this process
is determining the level of interest. We would greatly
appreciate it if you would complete the short survey

Research Internship (with stipend): Buttery behaviour
and speciation in the tropics
We are seeking a research intern to work at the Smith-
sonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama
from the end of June 2018 for a period of at least one
year. The internship will focus on behaviour and diver-
sication in Heliconius butteries.
The intern will work as part of a team involving col-
laboration between Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at,
Munich (http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/merrill/-
index.html ) and STRI (https://stri.si.edu/scientist/-
owen-mcmillan). The intern will join a vibrant and
highly international community of scientists studying
the origins and maintenance of tropical diversity (see
also: http://www.heliconius.org).
The project is based in Gamboa, Panama and the intern
will be assisting a project investigating the genetic basisof behavioural isolation between Heliconius species. The
project involves breeding butteries, managing crossing
experiments and conducting behavioural assays. The
internship is a learning experience and there will be
opportunities to develop independent projects. Appli-
cants must be able to work both with a group and
independently, and be committed to working full time

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
DAMBE has been updated to Version 7 (new version
was uploaded last week).
Three features are relevant to evolutionary biologists:
1) Simultaneous imputation of missing distances and
phylogenetic reconstruction
2) More accurate estimation of the shape parameter of
gamma distribution. This is a simple way of estimating
alpha from a continuous-gamma model, based on GuJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 57
and Zhang (1997). Alpha from a discrete-gamma model
tend to underestimate alpha. It uses a simultaneous
method to estimate site-specic number of substitutions,
making use of information from all sites instead of a
single site.
3) An improved LPB93 method. The K80 model in
the original is replaced by the F84 model for correct-
ing multiple hits at 0- fold, 2-fold and 4-fold sites. To
avoid inapplicable cases, the original independent esti-
mation is replaced by simultaneous estimation. Let me
know if you wish to have implementation details and
comparisons.
A short tutorial is available for using these three meth-
ods: http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/software download/-

caUIllinois Chicago EcoEvoDevoA postdoctoral position focusing on eco-evo-devo is avail-
able in Alexander Shingleton's laboratory at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, Chicago.
The project uses Drosophila as a model to understand
how the environment regulates development to gen-
erate phenotypic plasticity and how this regulation
evolves. Research in the Shingleton Lab spans multiple
disciplines including developmental genetics, physiology,
bioinformatics, mathematical modeling, ecology and
evolutionary biology, and the project will incorporate
many of these. The specic project is to elucidate the
mechanisms that regulate sex-specic dierences in the
phenotypic plasticity of body size, in particular in re-
sponse to changes in dierent aspects of developmental
nutrition. The project is, however, open ended, and the
successful candidate will be encouraged and expected
to take the research in a direction that matches their
particular skills and career goals. The postdoc is funded
for three years.
You should hold a PhD in biology and must be com-
fortable exploring biological processes at multiple levels
of organization. The ideal candidate will have exten-
sive experience in Drosophila developmental genetics
but individuals with researchers with expertise in the
developmental physiology of other insects are also en-
couraged to apply. Your exact eld of research to date
is less important than your demonstrated record of pub-
lication and tenacity. Nevertheless, you should have a
solid background in statistics and/or bioinformatics and
either be procient in R or willing/able to learn R to an
advanced level through self-study. Candidates who are
also interested in mathematical modeling of biological
processes are particularly encouraged to apply.
The Shingleton Lab oers a dynamic work environment
with excellent opportunities for independent and collab-
orative research. We have a track record of mentoring
undergraduate research and postdocs with an interest
in working with undergraduates will nd a particularly
welcoming environment.
The lab is moving to UIC in August 2018 and will be
within the Ecology and Evolution Group in the Depart-
ment of Biological Sciences. The department is home to
a diverse and dynamic set of research groups who study
a wide-variety of biological questions, utilizing a corre-
spondingly wide-variety of tools and techniques. The
department is located in the center of Chicago. More
details on the lab, department and university can be

Caltech Genomics Convergence
Symbiosis
Postdoctoral position in genomics of convergence and
social symbiosis (Parker Lab)
A postdoctoral position is available to study the ge-
nomic basis of evolutionary convergence in the lab of
Joe Parker at the California Institute of Technology.
Work in the Parker lab is focused on the evolution of com-
plex phenotypes, principally in the context of symbiosis.
We use a unique system to explore this phenomenon: the
convergent evolution of symbioses between rove beetles
and social insects. Rove beetles (family Staphylinidae)
are the largest metazoan family, and include multiple
remarkable lineages that have evolved to become \social
parasites" stealth impostors that inltrate ant or termite
societies, employing radical behavioral, anatomical and
chemical adaptations. We have found that many of the
most extreme symbiotic phenotypes have evolved con-
vergently numerous times in distantly related lineages.
We are a now seeking a postdoctoral candidate to probe
the genomic basis of complex phenotypic convergence in
this system. Our goals are twofold: i) Pinpoint shared
or unique molecular changes that drive the evolution
of social symbiosis in rove beetles; ii) Make basic infer-
ences into the long-standing question of how complex
phenotypic changes can arise repeatedly and predictably
over deep evolutionary timescales.
Aspects of this work will involve two study systems: 1)
A deep-time system encompassing symbiont lineages
from across the rove beetle subfamily Aleocharinae that
are separated by up to 100 million years. 2) A recently-
evolved system in which multiple rove beetle lineages
have convergently evolved symbioses with a single ant
genus in the South Western US. This latter project in-
volves potential eldwork at sites in Southern California
and Arizona. The successful candidate will spearhead
genome sequencing of free-living and symbiotic species
from across phylogeny, and use comparative genomic
tools to understand patterns of genome evolution. Thereis potential for collaboration with Caltech labs using
machine learning and single cell proling, and the candi-
date will also lead genome/transcriptome assembly and
annotation of several higher quality reference genomes to
facilitate functional genetic studies in laboratory model
rove beetle species. Depending on the candidate, the
project may involve wet lab work to functionally test
loci with possible causal roles in symbiosis, or involve
collaboration with others to this end.

Postdoctoral position in plant-microbe interaction: In-
teractions between bacteria and viruses in co-infected
hosts: eects on host resistance and on the evolution of
pathogen virulence.
Madrid, Spain
Project Summary:
In agro and natural- ecosystems, plants simultaneously
interact with multiple microbes and eventually some
of them successfully infect producing a disease. The
knowledge on specic mechanisms and events under-
lying the outcome of a plant-pathogen interaction has
fundamentally arisen from studies in a single host-single
pathogen frame. It has been suggested that multiple
infections are a major force driving pathogen evolution,
but with the exception of virus-virus interactions,
the eect of coinfection on disease production and
pathogen evolution has been scarcely documented at
the experimental level. The general objective of this
proposal is to understand the eects of interactions
between viruses and bacteria, in coinfected plants,
on plant resistance and on the pathogens infectivity
and virulence. This objective will be tackled using
tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) coinfected with the
bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv, tomato (PsPto)
and the RNA virus tomato mosaic virus (ToMV).
The designed approach, combining the analysis of
multiple infections outcome and pathogen evolutionary
studies under dierent selective pressures would be
pioneer in the area, and will open new avenues for
the design of novel preventive and control strategies
that may increase the sustainability of plant disease
control. The research project, and is collaboration
between the \Plant-virus interaction and co-evolution"

A position for an advanced postdoc in the eld of behav-

Diethard Tautz (Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology, Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Ploen,Germany). The postdoc will be in charge of running a
dedicated facility to study mice under semi-natural con-
ditions. The department runs also a mouse house that
harbors a collection of outbred house mouse populations
from the wild, as well as inbred strains. These serve as
a basis to study the natural behavior of mice using both,
standardized behavioral tests, as well as semin-natural
conditions. Previous studies in the facility have dealt
with questions of assortative mating, the role of ultra-
sonic vocalization, as well as the role of anxiety and
personality on teeriotoriality and reproductive success.

EvolutionaryGenomics
A two-year post-doctoral position is open at Institut des
Sciences de l' ^AEvolution (ISEM), Universit e de Montpel-
lier, France, to study evolutionary genomics of natural
sex reversal in a mouse species.
In natural populations of the African Pygmy mouse
(/Mus minutoides/), two types of X chromosomes co-
exist, one of which (named X*) is feminizing, produc-
ing a very high proportion of fully fertile X*Y females.
Therefore, the X* is a new type of sex chromosome,
completely unique among mammals: a third sex chro-
mosome that behaves like a**female heterogametic**W
chromosome. This induces a drastic change in the modes
of transmission of sex chromosomes, which in this sys-
tem can thus be either strictly female (X*), or bisexual
(X and Y). We study in the lab dierences of life-history
traits associated with the dierent sexual types (XX,
X*X and X*Y females, XY males), in order to under-
stand how this new mode of transmission contributes to
the evolution of sex-linked phenotypic dierences and
of potential antagonism over their control.**
The post-doc will study the genomic aspects of this
question, by analyzing various available datasets:
-Participate in the /de novo/ assembly and annotation
of the X and X* chromosomes.
-Analyse dierential gene expression between sexual
types from RNA-seq data.
-Analyse population genomics data.
The results will contribute to understand the evolution-
ary forces driving the birth, building and spread of a new
mammalian sex determination system, to**test theories
of the role of sexual antagonism in the evolution of sex
chromosome architecture, and to decipher the genetic
basis of this novel sex determining program.
The post-doc will work in Montpellier at Institut des
Sciences de l' ^AEvolution (with Frederic Veyrunes and
Pierre Boursot), in close collaboration with The Earl-
ham Institute, Norwich, UK (David Thybert) and the
Institut de G en etique Humaine, Montpellier (Francis72 EvolDir June 1, 2018
Poulat).
The candidate should have strong proven skills in bioin-
formatics for genomic data analyses (genome and tran-
scriptome sequences). A background in biology (molec-
ular or evolutionary biology) would be a plus.
The candidate should preferably have defended his/her
PhD no longer than 4 years before the start of the
post-doc, and should preferably not have worked in
Montpellier during the last two years.
Salary will be according to the rules of Universit e de
Montpellier, up to 2200 Euros/month net, depending
on experience.
Starting date: from September 2018 to January 2019 at
the latest.

Paris EvolutionAntibioticResistance
We are looking for a post doctoral researcher to model
vaccination and niche competition eects in the gut
for microbiota engineering, to target antibiotic-resistant
bacteria. Antibiotic multi-resistant (AMR) bacteria that
frequently inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and
livestock are a serious threat. Our recent work demon-
strates that intestinal antibodies, raised by inactivated
oral vaccines, enforce the targeted strain to undergo
\enchained growth", forming large clonal clumps, which
change the eective population size, important for evo-
lution of resistance. During the project, a protocol
combining vaccination with introduction of a niche com-
petitor, for targeted drug-free removal of an individual
bacterial strain from the microbiota of mice, will be
developed, and extended to domestic pigs. Combining
mathematical models and quantitative dynamic data
will provide a solid framework for subsequent large-scale
trials and extension to more diverse bacterial species
and hosts.
The postdoc will analyze experimental data to extractinformation about the bacterial populations dynamics.
He/she will develop biophysical models of the micro-
biota dynamics and evolution in the gut, integrating
immune dynamics and competition, and animal size
and physiology. Beyond the direct applications to the
experiments of the project, the goal is to gain a better
understanding on how the physical conditions in the gut
interplay with the microbiota dynamics and evolution.
The postdoc will be based in Sorbonne Universite, Paris,
under the supervision of Claude Loverdo, and the work
will be in close collaboration with Emma Slack, ETH
Zurich. The postdoc will be integrated to the theory
team of the Laboratoire Jean Perrin, a young and dy-
namic biophysical lab, in the center of Paris. The post-
doc duration is 12+ months, start date negotiable from
September 2018, with salary according to experience.
The candidate should have a PhD (or have it completed
before the start of the position), in relevant eld, and a
strong experience in modeling.
If you are interested please send us a CV and a short
email motivating your interest in the position.

The Senckenberg Gesellschaft f ur Naturforschung (SGN)
is a member of the Leibniz Association and is based
in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. SGN conducts natu-
ral history research with almost 800 employees and re-
search institutions in six federal states. Within SGN, the
Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre
(BiK-F) explores the interactions between biodiversity,
climate, and society. For the working group Quantita-
tive Biogeography we invite applications for a
Vegetation / Ecosystem Modeller (m/f) (full time posi-
tion, 3 years)
The applicant should work with dierent aspects of
the development and applications of regional to global
dynamic vegetation models, most likely based on the
Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-
GUESS). Possible research topics include the role of
higher tropic levels, the importance of plant trait vari-
ability for ecosystem functioning and resilience, forest
and/or livestock management, linkages between ecosys-
tem/habitat changes and biodiversity change (ranging
from longer-term evolutionary and extinction dynam-
ics to the current protection of biodiversity), feedbacks
on the climate system (e.g. via changes in the carbon
cycle, the land surface, re and trace gas emissions),
and more applied climate impact research. Priorities
will also depend on the interests of the applicant, the
development of the research eld and success in related
research proposals by the working group. The applicant

StockholmU EvolutionaryGenomics
Researcher in Evolutionary Genomics A postdoctoral
researcher position in evolutionary genomics is currently
available at Stockholm University and Science for Life
Laboratory in the research group of Dr. Tanja Slotte.
Deadline for applications is June 1, 2018.
Full ad https://bit.ly/2jQPA6p Project description
The position is associated with the European Research
Council (ERC) funded project SuperGenE: Supergene
evolution in a classic plant system - genomic studies of
distyly.
The aim of this project is to investigate the genomic
architecture underlying the balanced oral polymor-
phism distyly in wild Linum species. Specically, we
will identify the genomic region (termed supergene) that
governs distyly in Linum and test whether this super-
gene exhibits evolutionary genetic similarities to sex
chromosomes. For this purpose, we will conduct evolu-
tionary genetic analyses of cutting-edge genomic data
to comprehensively investigate the tempo and mode of
recombination suppression, the impact of natural selec-
tion, and regulatory evolution at the supergene in three
distylous species. We will also investigate the genetic
basis and population genomic consequences of three
losses of distyly that are likely associated with a change
in the breeding system.
Main responsibilities The position involves research in
the ERC project SuperGenE. The researcher will con-
duct evolutionary genetic analyses of genomic and gene
expression data. The position may also include sam-
pling of natural plant populations in the Mediterranean
region.
Qualication requirements A PhD degree and training in
evolutionary genetics or population genomics is required.June 1, 2018 EvolDir 79
Experience of bioinformatic analyses of large-scale ge-
nomic or gene expression data is benecial. Experience
of evolutionary genetic studies of sex chromosome evo-
lution is benecial, but not required.
Assessment criteria In the appointment process, special
attention will be given to research skills, in particular
pertaining to evolutionary genetics/population genetics.
Excellent prociency in English (the working language
of the group) is required. The researcher needs to be
able to work well in a collaborative environment, as well
as independently. Finally, creativity and drive, and an
aptitude for problem-solving are personal characteristics
that are desirable.
Terms of employment The position involves full-time
employment for a maximum of two years, with possi-
bility of extension. Start date immediately or as per
agreement.
Stockholm University strives to be a workplace free from
discrimination and with equal opportunities for all.
Infrastructure and environment The researcher will be

StockholmU EvolutionCognition
Postdoctoral Fellow in the Evolution of Cognition and
the Brain
at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University,
Sweden
Deadline for application: May 29, 2018.A postdoctoral position focused on cognitive evolution
is available in Alexander Kotrschal's research group in
the Department of Zoology at Stockholm University.
The project uses the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) as a
model to comparatively and experimentally investigate
the factors driving cognitive evolution. As such, the
project spans over multiple disciplines including eld
collections, articial selection, assays of behaviour and
detailed tests of cognitive ability, brain imaging and
neural density estimations, and analyses of the genomic
architecture that orchestrates changes in brain anatomy
and cognitive ability.
The project will use both animals from wild populations
with known dierences in ecology, and from a selection
experiment. These animals will be subjected to relevant
assays of behaviour, brain anatomy and genomics. The
overall aim of the project is thus to increase our under-
standing of the evolutionary relationship between brain
anatomy, cognitive ability and the genome.
The work will mostly be lab-oriented but includes at
least one eld trip to Trinidad. The project will require
hard work but at the same time provide excellent oppor-
tunities for personal initiatives and development towards
pursuing a successful academic career. An important
task will be to undertake selection experiments followed
by the collection and analysis of complex data. The
project is undertaken in a brand new section of the large
tropical freshwater sh labs in the Department of Zool-
ogy with established assays of brain anatomy, several
dierent aspects of cognitive abilities, swimming param-
eters, personality, individual and collective behaviour,
etc.
The successful candidate will be part of an international
team consisting of an Ethologist (Alexander Kotrschal,
Stockholm University), Evolutionary Biologist (David
Reznick, University of California & Trinidad), Genome
Biologist (Alison E. Wright, University of Sheeld),
and Information Technology researcher (Kristiaan Pel-
ckmans, Uppsala University) that investigate the evo-
lution of cognition, brain anatomy and the genome via
state-of-the-art methods.
In the appointment process, special attention will be
given to research skills in cognitive evolution, with excel-
lent analytical ability and experience from quantitative
analyses of behaviour and other traits of interest. Ex-
perience in working with aquatic animals in the lab is
especially meriting.
The position involves full-time employment for a max-
imum of two years, with the possibility of extension
under special circumstances. Start date July 2018 or as
per agreement.80 EvolDir June 1, 2018

UBath EvolutionaryPaleontology
Applications are invited for a two-year position as a
Postdoctoral Research Associate, as part of a research
project on mass extinction and recovery, and with par-
ticular emphasis on the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg)
boundary. The project, led by Dr. Nicholas Longrich, is
part of a 5-year project funded by the Leverhulme Foun-
dation and based at the Milner Centre for Evolution
(https://themilnercentre.org/) at the University of Bath.
The Milner Centre is a new, researcher-led initiative do-
ing fundamental research in evolution and answering
major questions in evolutionary biology. Supported by
a 5 million donation to create a new building, our goalJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 81
is to create an internationally excellent centre for evo-
lutionary biology and establish Bath as a leader in the
eld, producing great science and excellent researchers.
The project goal is to understand the severity, selectiv-
ity, and recovery from mass extinction, and the role of
extinctions in driving evolution. Earth's history is punc-
tuated by mass extinctions - severe, global, and rapid
events that wiped out vast numbers of species. The dy-
namics of these extinctions are incompletely understood.
How many species were lost? How did survivors dier
from victims? How did the ecosystem recover? How did
extinction aect the distribution of species on Earth?
Do recoveries simply replace lost diversity, or do they
lead evolution to pursue dierent directions? To answer
these questions, we are undertaking a series of studies of
the K-Pg transition. We will study new Cretaceous and
Paleogene fossils from terrestrial ecosystems in North
America and marine vertebrates in Morocco, synthesize
data from the literature on the diversity and distribution
of invertebrates, and use molecular clocks to search for
signals of adaptive recovery in the Cenozoic. The project
will also extend this work to other extinction events to
understand the degree to which mass extinctions are
governed by common patterns and processesot.
As part of the project, we seek a postdoctoral researcher
with a strong relevant research background in palaeon-
tology, evolutionary biology, and/or geology. The re-
searcher appointed will be involved in both leading and
collaborating in research within the project, including
identifying new collaborative and funding opportunities.
They will also have a signicant role as deputy leader of
the laboratory, including day-to-day running of the lab,
leading meetings, supervising postgraduates and junior
researchers and recruiting new members. Skills in this
area, in addition to a strong research background, are
thus important for this role.
Please include with your application:
- Full CV including publication list
- Cover letter, discussing research experience and goals,
and what you will bring to this project
- Contact details for three references

Description Description: The Moorjani Lab (https://-
moorjanilab.org/) at University of California, Berkeley
has a post-doctoral position available for motivated
candidates with background in statistical Human Evo-
lutionary Genetics and/or data science.
Our lab focuses on using statistical and computational
approaches to study questions in human genetics and
evolutionary biology. A central aim in the lab is to
understand the impact of evolutionary history on ge-
netic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomic
datasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.
Minimum/Basic Qualications required at the time of
application: - Completion of all doctoral degree require-
ments except the dissertation in genetics, computational
biology, biostatistics, Human Evolutionary Genetics or
related elds.
Additional Qualications (required by start date): -
PhD or equivalent degree in genetics, computational
biology, biostatistics, Human Evolutionary Genetics or
a related eld. - Knowledge of statistics and Human
Evolutionary Genetics theory. - Demonstrated record of
research productivity and publications. - Programming
experience (e.g. C/C++, Python/ Perl, R or other
programming languages)

PlantSystematicsEvolution
The research group of Felipe Zapata in the Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is looking for
a highly motivated, creative postdoc. The main focus
of the group is evolutionary and systematic biology, par-
ticularly studies aimed at learning about the origin and
evolution of biodiversity, reconstructing the history of
populations, species, and clades, and generating/testing
hypotheses about processes promoting taxonomic and
phenotypic diversication.84 EvolDir June 1, 2018
The postdoc could work on a variety of projects using
dierent types of data. Specics of the research projects
are exible, but could include: population and speciation
genomics to study how populations/species dierentiate
and multiply; spatial analyses of eco-phenotypic and ge-
nomic data to learn about the nature of species; testing
alternative hypotheses on speciation and diversication
at dierent phylogenetic scales; generating/testing hy-
potheses to study the evolution of genomes and pheno-
types in lineages with contrasting eco-phenotypic vari-
ation; and developing computational tools for compar-
ative biology (in the context of the projects described
above). The research group conducts empirical work
with a main focus on angiosperms from the Andes, cen-
tral America, and the California Floristic Province. The
research group is small but is growing, and the postdoc
will have the opportunity to play a critical role in the
intellectual growth and development of the group.
The EEB department at UCLA is an exciting place to
conduct research in evolutionary and systematic biol-
ogy, with numerous research groups focused on similar
areas (e.g., Alfaro, Barber, Campbell-Staton, Jacobs,
Lohmueller, Sears, Shaer, Smith, Sork). Outside EEB,
UCLA oers several opportunities for learning, collab-
orating, teaching, and mentoring in one of the largest
and most diverse public universities in the US.
Los Angeles is a vibrant and multicultural city, and it
provides a welcoming environment to everyone. The
research group of Felipe Zapata is a safe space and
is committed to increasing diversity in the scientic
community. Applications from diverse candidates with
overlapping scientic interests are strongly encouraged.
Qualications: Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, system-
atic biology, organismic biology, plant biology, or similar
elds. Strong and genuine interest in organisms is re-
quired (there will be opportunities to do eld work,
lab work, and herbarium work). Background in script-
ing/programming is a big bonus (but it can be learned).
Salary will be competitive and only recent graduates
with no previous postdoctoral experience will be consid-
ered for this position. Start date is exible, but ideally
sometime in summer/fall of 2018. The position is for one
year, with potential for renewal for up to one additional
year.

EXPERIMENTAL POSTDOC POSITION: SINGLE-
CELL EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS
Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), Heidelberg Uni-
versity, Germany
The position: The Kaessmann lab is looking for an
ambitious and highly qualied postdoctoral researcher
interested in unravelling the molecular and cellular basis
of the evolution of species-specic organ phenotypes in
mammals based on single-cell experiments.
Background: A primary goal in biology is to understand
the molecu ^Abasis of phenotypic evolution, most notably
that of humans and other mammals. Most phenotypic
dierences between species are likely due to regulatory
mutations that aect gene expression. Our lab has there-
fore previously generated comprehensive sets of RNA-
seq data and various other high-throughput \omics"
(e.g., epigenomic, metabolomic, proteomic) datasets for
a large collection of tissues from representative mam-
mals and performed integrated analyses of these data
to study the expression (regulatory) evolution of mam-
malian genomes across gene types, lineages, organs,
developmental stages, chromosomes and sexes (see e.g.
Brawand et al. Nature 2011, Necsulea et al. Nature
2014, Cortez et al. Nature 2014; selected publications
are listed below).
We have recently begun to bring all of previous \evo-
devo" work to the cellular level and thus illuminate
how evolutionary changes in cellular composition and
underlying gene regulatory networks have led to the
emergence of species- or lineage-specic organ anatomies
and functions.
The project: The rst aim for this postdoctoral position
is to develop and apply single-cell sequencing proto-
cols for proling transcriptomes and epigenomes across
various tissues and developmental stages from selected
mammalian and other vertebrate species. The second
goal, which will be based on results from the rst aim,
is to utilize cellular and/or animal systems (derived
from dierent species and tissues) in conjunction with
genome engineering techniques to identify key regula-
tory mutations that underlie the evolution of distinct
cellular phenotypes.
The candidate: The ideal candidate has experience andJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 87
strong experimental skills in molecular and cell biol-
ogy; preferably related to RNA biology, genome editing
techniques (e.g., CRISPR/Cas), high-throughput as-
say development and/or pluripotent stem cells (e.g.,
iPS cells). Expertise in genetic engineering of mice or
other organisms, developmental biology, the biology of
specic organs (e.g., the brain), and/or genome-scale
work (experimental and/or bioinformatic) is a plus. The
candidate should ideally be driven by a passion for evo-
lutionary biology.
The position requires the ability to independently take
responsibility for the project, as well as strong team-
work and communication skills, problem-solving abil-
ities, reliability, attention to detail and eective time
management.
Research environment and location: The postdoc will be
supported by research technicians and will work closely
together with bioinformaticians and other wet lab scien-
tists in our interdisciplinary group. The language of our
institute (ZMBH) is English and hosts scientists from
around the world. The institute is located in Heidelberg,
a picturesque cosmopolitan city that oers a very stim-
ulating, diverse and collaborative research environment
thanks also to neighboring cutting-edge institutions, in
particular the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ).
In fact, the postdoctoral project will be carried out in
the framework of collaborations with groups and core
facilities from these two institutions.

CnidarianVenomEvolution
Postdoctoral position in genomics and transcriptomics
of venom in cnidarians (Reitzel Lab)
A postdoctoral position is available to study genetic
diversity and expression of venom genes in cnidarians
in the lab of Adam Reitzel at the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte.
Work in the Reitzel lab is focused broadly on the ecology
and evolution of sea anemones. For this NSF-funded
position, I am seeking a postdoctoral candidate to probe
the genomic diversity and expression dynamics of venom
genes in sea anemones from dierent populations and
closely related species. Our goals are twofold: i) De-
termine the extent of genetic diversity for venom genes
throughout a species' geographic range and over shal-
low evolutionary time; ii) Characterize dierences in
expression of these venom genes when these anemones
experience dierent biotic and abiotic conditions.
Aspects of this work will primarily involve the anemone
Nematostella vectensis, which has a broad geographic
range in estuaries throughout North America. This
project involves a direct collaboration with Dr. Yehu
Moran's lab (Hebrew University, Jerusalem) to under-
stand the function and potency of these venom proteins
on prey and predators. Depending on the candidate,
the project may involve eld work and wet lab work but
the focus will be primarily on generation and analysis
of high throughput sequence data from existing sam-
ples. The selected candidate will have the opportunity
to explore independent research directions during their
time that contribute to a broader understanding of the
evolution and ecology of venom.
Candidates
Applications are encouraged from individuals who have
a Ph.D. or are nearing completion of their Ph.D. with
experience in genome and transcriptome sequencing, an-
notation, comparative genomics and genome evolution.
Interest or experience in venom research are desirable
but not required. Top candidates will have a strong
track record of research productivity and interest in
collaborative science.

of functional genomics and evolutionary developmental
biology. The postdoc will work as part of a collabora-

drive color pattern diversity in butteries. The success-
ful candidate will join the Riccardo Papa lab and be
hired through the University of Puerto Rico, but will
be physically based in the Robert Reed Lab at Cor-

researchers and directly interact with an international
collaborative team that includes the Arnaud Martin Lab94 EvolDir June 1, 2018
at George Washington University, the Owen McMillan
Lab at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,
and the Brian Counterman Lab at Mississippi State
University. The postdoc's research will specically focus
on regulatory evolution of the wing pattern morphogen
gene WntA, which underlies development of the ma-
jor central wing patterns. The regulation of this gene
has diversied dramatically within and between species,
and population genetic work shows that variation in
expression can be traced to regulatory regions adjacent
to WntA. We are now working to ask the questions (1)
what are the cis-regulatory elements that drive the evo-
lution of WntA expression, (2) how did these regulatory
elements rst arise, and (3) how are these elements evolv-
ing to produce morphological variation? We are asking
this question both within species (Heliconius mimicry)
and between species (the family Nymphalidae). Our
primary experimental approach is to combine whole-
genome comparative assays of regulatory element ac-
tivity (ATAC-seq) with functional validation (CRISPR
and reporter constructs). The successful candidate will
be encouraged to visit and work in collaborating labs
depending on specic experimental goals. The postdoc
will produce rst-author publications representing their
own intellectually independent work.
TO APPLY Please submit IN A SINGLE PDF FILE:
(i) a cover letter including motivation and research in-

UVienna PhD Postdoc
EvolutionaryGenomics
Title: UVienna.PhD Postdoc.EvolutionaryGenomics
Applications are invited for one Ph.D. and one postdoc
position in the group of Qi Zhou in the Department
of Molecular Evolution and Development at University
of Vienna, Austria. Both are supported by the Euro-
pean Research Council (ERC) grant, and planned for
two years for postdoc, and three years for Ph.D. with
possible renewal. The successful applicants will use
bioinformatic and experimental methods to study the
evolution of Drosophila sex chromosomes. Most model
species' sex chromosomes, e.g., those of human and D.
melanogaster bear few traces of their evolution, because
they are too ancient and have become too repetitive
in sequence for investigation. A fundamental question
concerns evolution biologist is what are the causes and
consequences of Y chromosome degeneration? We will
be using Drosophila species with recently born sex chro-
mosome ('neo-sex') systems to address: How does the
Y chromosome become epigenetically inert? How does
this universal evolution process drive the adaptation
of small RNA defence systems? And how does such a
male-specic arms race between parasitic transposable
elements and small RNAs fuel the changes of the female
genome? The candidates are expected to be independent
and highly motivated. Essential qualications include
demonstrated experience either in Drosophila genetics
experiments (transgenics, CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis,
in situ hybridisation) or bioinformatic studies (RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq and corresponding NGS data analyses).
Successful applicants will receive very competitive
salary and benets (https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-
funding/personnel-costs/), and enjoy the diverse and
vibrant research environment of the Department and the
University. The group members have frequent interac-
tions with other neighbour labs of Drosophila neurobiol-
ogy (Prof. Thomas Hummel) and developmental biology
(Prof. Ulrich Technau), and have a chance to develop
other collaborative research projects. The university
is located in the city centre of Vienna, which houses
numerous world's leading research institutes including
Gregor Mendel Institute, Institute of Molecular Biotech-
nology and Institute of Science and Technology etc. The
city now has gathered many great scientists in evolu-
tionary biology (http://www.univie.ac.at/evolvienna/-?page id=6), RNA biology (http://www.mfpl.ac.at/rna-
biology/) and there is an encouraging plan to move
the biology departments of the University near other
institutes of Vienna Biocenter to form a new research
cluster. Vienna has been voted as the world's most
livable city for the eighth time, and is famous for its
history and culture, and now also a modern and in-
ternational lifestyle. Interested candidates please send
her/his CV and contact information of three referees
to Dr. Qi Zhou (qi.zhou@univie.ac.at). We will start
reviewing the application immediately until the position
is lled.

June 2018 at PR statistics head oce, 53 MorrisonStreet, Glasgow, Scotland, G5 8LB
1) Species distribution models using R (SDMR01)
Course Overview: The aim of this four-day course is to
work towards an understanding of, and practical ability
to t, species distribution models (SDMs). It will be
useful if you plan to use SDMs, or if you just want to
understand them better. We will focus on statistical
models of species distributions - those that combine
observed species records with environmental data. Us-
ing a mixture of lectures, computer exercises and case
studies, participants will learn to: 1) identify relevant
data, and prepare it for modelling; 2) t models using
several modelling methods (including Maxent, general-
ized linear models and their extensions, and boosted
regression trees); 3) consider how to model species if
detection is imperfect; 4) evaluate models and interpret
them; 5) understand the range of practical issues that
arise in typical applications of SDMs. Practical sessions
will use the free statistical software, R - prior experi-
ence (even if some practice before you come) will be
useful. Example data will be provided but participants
may also bring their own data. Presenters include Jane
Elith and Gurutzeta Guillera-Arroita, who are highly
experienced in SDMs.
2) Species distribution/occupancy modelling using
PRESENCE and R (OCCU01) Course Overview: The100 EvolDir June 1, 2018
presence or absence of a species across a set of landscape
units is a fundamental concept widely used in ecology
(e.g., species range or distribution, epidemiology, habitat
modeling, resource selection probability functions, as
a monitoring metric, metapopulation studies, biodiver-
sity and species co-occurrence). An important sampling
issue, however, is that a species may not always be de-
tected when present at a landscape unit. This will result
in \false absences" causing parameter estimates to be
biased if unaccounted for, possibly leading to misleading
results and conclusions, even with moderate levels of
imperfect detection. This workshop will cover many of
the latest methods for modeling patterns and dynamics
of species occurrence in a landscape while accounting
for the imperfect detection of the species. Including: -
estimating level of occurrence at single point in time
- identifying factors that inuence species occurrence -
creating species distribution maps - modelling changes
in distribution over time - study design Participants
will be introduced to available software through worked
examples, and there will be special emphasis on aspects
of study design. While primarily aimed at the beginner
and intermediate level, more experienced researchers
will also benet from attending. The rst four days
will comprise of formal lectures and exercises, and the
nal morning will be an informal discussion/consulting
session where participants can work on their own data,
talk one-on-one with the instructor, etc.

Course Announcement: Ecology through the omics lens.
Last Call.
Dear colleagues, We still have few spots available for
the 6th edition of the Ramon Margalef Summer Collo-
quia: 'Ecology through the omics lens' organized by the
Marine Sciences Institute (ICM-CSIC) which will take
place from July 8th - 13th in Barcelona, Spain.
Deadline for applications is extended until 10th of May!
Course Overview: The use of omics techniques has
spread rapidly across the eld of Ecology and Evolu-
tion during the last decade, but there is substantial
work ahead to link the obtained results with the exis-
tent ecological theory. The course aims to move from
\what" to \why" when using omics approaches to study
the ecosystem, as well as to frame their omics-based
research in a theoretical ecological fr amework. The
course will cover dierent environments (marine, ter-
restrial, host associated) as well as organismal sizes
(from microbes to plants and animals), thus becoming
an excellent opportunity to bring together researchers
with similar questions, but working in elds that seldom
communicate between each other.
The Colloquium will be structured in 4 sessions.
Each session consist of a combination of lectures,
and group discussions. Take a look at the CON-
FIRMED SPEAKERS at: http://www.acoio.org/-
margalef-summer-colloquia/program/ or see below.
INTENDED AUDIENCE: Advanced doctoral students
and early post-docs are encouraged to apply.
Deadline for applications is extended until 10th of May.
FELLOWSHIPS to students from developing countries
are available. DISCOUNTS for ISME members, SCB
members and BIB members.

Barcelona EvolutionaryNGS Jul2-6
Dear all,
here you can nd information about the postgraduate
course \INTRODUCTION TO NEXT-GENERATION
SEQUENCING: APPLICATIONS IN ECOLOGY AND
EVOLUTION" (3 ECTS credits) which whill take place
in the Faculty of Biology (Universitat de Barcelona),
Barcelona, from 2nd to 6th July. The Institut Bot ~A
nic de Barcelona (CSIC), the Universidad Rey Juan
Carlos and the IRBio-Universitat de Barcelona partici-
pate in the course organisation, with the support of the
Fundacion General CSIC.
The course is aimed at graduates, postgraduates and
PhD students on Evolutionary Biology and related sci-ences, interested in knowing the new tools and the po-
tential that is being developed with the new techniques
of massive parallel sequencing. No specic training in
bioinformatics is necessary although basic knowledge is
desirable.
The main objective of this course is to show a battery of
potential applications of the NGS by researchers who are
currently working with this technological approach. As
an introductory course, the main purpose is not looking
for a complex or deep training in a specic technique,
but to give a broad view of the available approaches.
The assistant to this course should end with the feeling
of knowing the techniques and their applications, with
the purpose of being able to assess which ones may be
interesting for their research or on which to deepen in
later stages.
The specic objectives are:
1. To present an updated information on the dierent
NGS techniques and their applications, potential and
complexity.
2. To provide basic training in the main software for
each of the techniques, as well as in data processing,
and give tips on how to expand knowledge. This in-
cludes from the quality analysis, edition and analysis of
the les to the interpretation of results. We aim that,
with this basic knowledge, the student can be trained
later if he is interested in a specic aspect of the ones
addressed (for example, attending specialized courses or
self-taught).
3. To favour the contact between students inter-
ested in specic techniques with teachers and special-
ized personnel, for possible collaborations or train-
ing. Please visit our website to have more informa-

Getting started with R
Where: Berlin
When: 18-22 June 2018
Instructor: Dr. Alexandre Courtiol (Reearcher at the
IZW, Berlin).
R is extremely powerful, free of charge and open source.
Despite these benets, many avoid R, or struggle with
it, as writing computer code to do any operation { a
requirement in R { is at rst both dicult and intimi-
dating.
This course aims at overcoming those challenges by
providing solid basics in R. At the end of the course,
participants should feel much more at ease writing a
computer script in the R language which covers the
entire spectrum of a statistical analysis: reading data,
editing them, plotting them, and analysing them.
This course is aimed at scientists from quantitative sci-
ences (e.g. biology, epidemiology, psychology...). It has
been created with biologists in mind but it should accom-
modate scientists from other disciplines. No previous
experience with R is required. Participants should have
a basic familiarity with statistical terms and concepts.

Berlin RADseq Jul2-6 LastCall
Dear all, last weeks to apply for our RAD-seq
data analysis Workshop based on Stacks 2.0 this
July (2nd-6th) in Berlin, with Dr. Julian Catchen
(University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; ( http:/-
/catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/ )) and Dr. Josie Paris (Uni-
versity of Sussex, UK).
We have the last 4 places left and attendees are seated
on a rst-come, rst-served basis.
In this course, we will introduce the dierent approaches
for obtaining reduced representation genome sequencing
data and will specially focus on the data analysis. We
will cover all necessary steps to obtain genome variants
from short read data that are informative for population
genetics, phylogenetic and association studies.
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are generating and/or analyzing reduced repre-
sentation genome sequencing data (RAD-seq, ddRAD,
2bRAD, GBS, $B!D(B). Examples demonstrated in this
course will involve primarily non-model organisms and
examples of applications of this data type for dierent
purposes will be covered. Attendees should have a back-
ground in biology. We will dedicate one session to some
basic and advanced Linux concepts. Attendees should
have also some familiarity with genomic data such as

info@physalia-courses.orgBerlin Rcourses June
Dear all,
we will run two R courses this June!
1) Getting started with R (18-22 June 2018) with
Dr. Alexandre Courtiol (Leibniz Institute for Zoo and
Wildlife Research, Berlin (Germany)):
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course13/ This course aims at overcoming those
challenges by providing solid basics in R. At the end
of the course, participants should feel much more
at ease writing a computer script in the R language
which covers the entire spectrum of a statistical
analysis: reading data, editing them, plotting them,
and analysing them. Because linear models are the
dominant statistical tool in many elds, the part of
the course focusing on analyses per se (see schedule)
will focus on those, but principles seen during the class
should greatly help those interested in other kind of
analyses as well. The course will be presented over ve
days and will mix explanations and guided exercises.
Students are free to practice with their own datasets
during the course.
|-
2)Advanced R Programming (25-29 June 2018) with VP
Nagraj (University of Virginia (USA))
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course26/ The goal of this course is to provide training
on how to start using R as a programming language:
to write new functions, develop new tools or, at the
very least, interact with data programmatically. While
some examples may be drawn from bioinformatics,
statistics and / or epidemiology, the material will
not focus on data analysis techniques. As such, the
course will generally be domain-agnostic. Researchers
from a variety of disciplines are welcome. Those
interested should have basicfamiliarity with R or
another programming language.

Berlin SpeciationGenomics Dec3-7
Course: Speciation Genomics
Berlin, 03-07 December 2018
Instructors:
Dr. Mark Ravinet (CEES, Univeristy of Oslo, Norway)
Dr. Joana I. Meier (University of Cambridge, UK)
Overview
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
growing eld of speciation genomics. The course aims
to take students from the initial steps required for han-
dling raw sequencing data to demographic modelling
and inference of genome-wide signatures of selection
and introgression. Through a combination of lectures
covering key theoretical and conceptual topics, along-
side hands-on exercises, participants will learn the most
important computational approaches used in speciation
genomics. This will include a heavy emphasis on data
visualization and intepretation. After completing of
the course, the participants should be able to begin
using NGS data to shed light on the genomic aspects of
speciation in their study system of choice.
Format
This course is designed for researchers and graduate
students with strong interests in applying novel high-
throughput DNA sequencing technologies to study the
population genomic basis of speciation. The course will
mainly focus on the analysis of NGS data for study
systems for which a reference genome is available. We
will provide theoretical lectures and hands-on exercises
drawing on examples of whole-genome resequenced and
RAD-sequencing data. Participants will make use of
the UNIX command line, R and Python throughout the
course.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background in
evolution and genomics. No programming or scripting
expertise is required. Previous experience in UNIX-
based command line and R is an advantage but a stan-
dard introduction will be provided. All hands-on ex-
ercises will be run in a Linux environment on remote
servers. Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStu-
dio.
Learning OutcomesHandling NGS data from raw reads to genetic variants
Applying basic population genetic statistics Visualiz-
ing the genetic structure Inferring demographic history
Identifying regions under divergent selection or barriers
to gene ow Understanding the potential and limitations
of dierent methods to detect regions under selection

Announcement: Arbor Short-Course and Hackathon for
Phylogenetic Comparative Methods
Short Course; 20-22 Sept 2018
Hackathon; 22-25 Sept 2018
Location: Cornell University, Ithaca NY
*Empiricists:* Are you sick of ghting with hard-to-use
software to carry out phylogenetic comparative analy-
ses? Do you seek a better way to complete analyses
that lets you focus more on your data and less on buggy,
hard-to-use code?
*Programmers*: Do you want to implement your meth-
ods in an easy-to-use, web-based framework? Would
you like to expand your user base by implementing your
methods on open-source web pages? Would you like
to interact with a network of programmers developing
modules to bring new functions to your comparative
methods?
If you are either of the above, we announce an NSF-
funded Short Course and Hackathon covering version
2.0 of Arbor, our software for comparative methods.
We will hold the *Short Course/Workshop* for end
users from Sept 20-22 2018. Attendees will learn how to
use Arbor to carry out ancestral state reconstructions,
test linear models, and many other comparative analy-
ses using a simple drag-and-drop interface implemented
over the web. The workshop will also include a series
of lectures on the basics of phylogenetic comparative
methods, as well as a chance for users to discuss their
work in a creative and supportive environment.
We will hold a *Hackathon* for programmers on 22-25
Sept 2018. Attendees will learn how Arbor can enable
them implement their own comparative method(s) over
the web, instantaneously building their userbase and
enabling integration with other software through work-
ow development. We will cover how to build and host
Arbor instances, implement new workows combining
methods for data manipulation, analysis, and visualiza-
tion, and deploy these workows on custom Arbor app
pages providing an easy-to-use interface for users of all
abilities.Both the workshop and the hackathon have funds
available to support travel and lodging for at-
tendees. Apply by lling out this Google Doc

MADPHYLO: Madrid Workshop in Statistical Phyloge-
netics
Where: Real Jardin Botanico (CSIC), Madrid, Spain
When: 2nd-12th August 2018
www.madphylo.com Course overview:
Darwin founded the eld of evolutionary biology on the
concept that all organisms are related to one another
through an unknown evolutionary tree. Phylogenetic
or evolutionary inference has become an essential tool
in many disciplines across the life sciences, from molec-
ular epidemiology to paleontology. In this workshop,
the participants will learn the theoretical and technical
basis of stochastic modeling in evolutionary biology and
phylogenetics. The workshop will also provide full train-
ing in the open software RevBayes, an R-like interactive
environment based on graphical model concepts for the
modeling of complex evolutionary problems. At the end
of the workshop, the student will have an understand-
ing of the assumptions behind state-of-the-art methods
used in modern phylogenetic analysis, as well as being
able to build up new models from existing functions in
RevBayes.
Instructors:
The lecturers are prominent analytical systematists and
evolutionary biologists, who are behind the development
of many of the methodological and computing tools rou-
tinely used in modern phylogenetic inference and evo-
lutionary biology: Prof. John Huelsenbeck (University110 EvolDir June 1, 2018
of California, Berkeley), Prof. Brian Moore (University
of California, Davis), Prof. Sebastian Hoehna (Univer-
sity Ludwig-Maximilians, Munich). The Workshop is
organized and directed by Dr. Isabel Sanmartin (Real
Jardin Botanico, CSIC, Madrid), who will also lecture.
Workshop details:
The course will be taught from August 2, 2018 to Au-
gust 12, 2018. Lectures and practicals will be tightly
linked, meaning that you will learn the theory and also
how to apply the theory on the same day. Students
are encouraged to bring their own laptops. The tuition
for the course is deliberately low, at only 250 Euros.
However, this tuition does not include room and board
during the course. You will be required to nd a place
to stay if you are from outside of Madrid.

shop will take place from September 26th-September
28th 2018 at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on, Germany.
It aims to clarify, update and expand on traditional
evolutionary thinking by providing a platform for dis-
cussion. Critics have argued evolutionary studies to be
very gene-centric and dismissive of other mechanisms
contributing to evolutionary change. In particular, they
call for a wider recognition of topics such as:
- Niche construction theory - Extra-genetic inheritance -
Developmental bias - Phenotypic plasticity
While the importance of these elds is backed by empir-ical evidence, wider recognition is trailing behind. We
would like to change that. If this interests you, please
join us and let's talk evolution
Keynote talks will be given by: - Paul M. Brakeeld
(Trinity College, UK) - Luis-Miguel Chevin (CEFE,

We invite applications for the Oak Spring eFLOWER
Summer School to be held at the Oak Spring Garden
Foundation in Upperville, Virginia (USA) from 18 to 27
September 2018. The goal of the Summer School is to
deliver high-quality training in the modern comparative
methods used to study plant macroevolution. While
the methods are general and applicable to any group of
organisms, all of our empirical datasets will be drawn
from our recent work on owering plants. A unique
feature of this School will be that the students them-
selves will participate in the creation of the datasets(oral traits and fossil calibrations) in our collaborative
database PROTEUS, thereby gaining hands-on expe-
rience of the problems and questions associated with
compiling data and building real-life datasets for compar-
ative analyses. In doing so, we hope to further promote
the rapidly evolving eld of macroevolution among grad-
uate students in plant sciences, while also conveying our
experience in building high-quality datasets.
Topics addressed in the Summer School will include:
divergence time estimation using molecular dating meth-
ods (relaxed clock methods, fossil calibration), ancestral
state reconstruction and correlation of morphological
traits (using maximum likelihood and Bayesian meth-
ods), and diversication rates and state-dependent di-
versication. All of these approaches start with phylo-
genetic trees obtained from molecular or genomic data
and thus prior understanding of and experience with
phylogenetic reconstruction based on such data is an
essential prerequisite for participants, because this topic
will not be taught in the Summer School. We also plan
to include an outreach component in the form of a short
video made by the participants during the course, ex-
plaining in simple terms what they have learned and
why these methods are important to understand plant
evolution.
The Oak Spring eFLOWER Summer School is free (no
registration fee), including food and accommodation on
site. All participants will also receive up to US $1000
on a reimbursement basis for their economy ights to
Dulles Airport (IAD), Washington D.C. In addition,
the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) will further
reimburse up to US $500 on air travel costs of up to
eight participants from more distant locations. Partici-
pants are entirely responsible for arranging their own
travel insurance and visas. The School is ideally suited
to graduate students (enrolled in a master's or PhD
program) who already have some botanical and phylo-
genetic background, but who lack training in current
macroevolutionary methods. International applicants
are welcome (but uency in English is a requirement of
the course) and we will attempt to achieve a good bal-
ance in terms of gender and origin in the nal Summer
School group selected.
To apply, please send a one-page letter of motivation
and a CV, as a single PDF le with your name, to
herve.sauquet@gmail.com. Deadline for applications:
1st June, 2018. Decisions will be made by 18th June.
Please include the names and contact details of two
referees (e.g., current or previous supervisor), but no
letter of support (we will contact referees if necessary).
Applications that do not meet these requirements may
be automatically rejected. The total number of partici-
pants will be limited to 15.112 EvolDir June 1, 2018

Workshop: eDNA Metbarcoding
When: 19-23 November 2018
Where: Institut de Biologie Int egrative et des Syst emes
(IBIS), Laval University, Qu ebec City (Qu ebec), Canada
Instructors:
Dr. Vasco Elbrecht (University of Guelph, Canada)
Eric Normandeau (Laval University, Canada)
Website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course40/ )
Course Overview Obtaining environmental DNA
(eDNA) from water, soil, air, gut content or other sam-
ple types holds great promises for biodiversity research
and assessment. Targeted species specic markers, and
broader, more inclusive metabarcoding approaches us-
ing universal primer sets can detect invasive and rare
rare species, or the range of taxa present in ecosystems
from trace amounts of DNA. eDNA can capture sample
diversity using non-invasive or minimally invasive meth-
ods/techniques. However, due to the low quantity of
DNA present in samples, these approaches often require
specialized laboratory protocols, careful sample han-
dling to prevent contamination, as well as specialized
bioinformatic processing due to high levels of noise and
the presence of non-target taxa.
After completing the workshop, students should be in a
position to (1) understand the potential and capabilities
of eDNA barcoding and metabarcoding, (2) run com-
plete analyses of eDNA metabarcoding pipelines and ob-
tain diversity inventories and ecologically interpretableJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 113
data from raw next-generation sequence data and (3) de-
sign their own eDNA projects, including bioinformatic
data analysis and planning of laboratory work. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
While this course will focus on eDNA metabarcoding,
however targeted single species detection and other al-
ternatives will also be explored, as they can sometimes
be suitable metabarcoding alternatives.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND This
workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research, and researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing eDNA
community. This workshop will review mostly tech-
niques and software useful for eukaryotic single species
detection and eDNA metabarcoding. Other workshops
focused on procedures currently used in bulk sample and
microbial metabarcoding will be available from Physalia-
courses. A survey will be provided 2 weeks ahead of
the workshop, where participants can mention topics or
aspects they are particularity interested in.
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments. Please make
sure to have linux installed if you bring a Windows
based laptop. Among the software and tools we will
be using is R or Rstudio (+ the JAMP & PrimerMiner
package), FastQC, Usearch, Vsearch, Cutadapt, and
mBRAVE.net. No prior knowledge of these software
packages is required.
TEACHING FORMAT The workshop is delivered over
5 days (see the detailed curriculum below). The lectures
are interactive with active discussion where asking ques-
tions is strongly encouraged. A key aspect of this course
are practical sessions in primer development, bioinfor-
matic analysis of high throughput sequence data, and
data visualization as well as a project planning exercise
to apply what you learned in this course.

workshops/course39/ )
Course Overview Next generation sequencing has revo-
lutionized evolutionary biology allowing unprecedented
resolution and insight into evolutionary questions that
appeared intractable only a few years ago. The course
will cover the basics of population genomic analysis from
SNP data onwards and will cover the key analyses that
may be required to successfully analyze a population
genetic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-
nomic analysis and be competent in population genomic
analysis.114 EvolDir June 1, 2018
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND This
workshop is aimed at postgraduate students and early
career researchers who are interested in using population
genomic tools in their research. No previous experience
of bioinformatics is required, but an underpinning in
evolutionary biology and basic population genetics con-
cepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and FST
are desirable. The course will use a range of software
including the Linux operating system and R.
TEACHING FORMAT The workshop is delivered over
ten half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of a combination of lectures and
practical exercises, with breaks at the organisers' ^A dis-
cretion. There will also be time for students to discuss
their own problems and data.

volves the high-throughput sequencing of random DNA
fragments isolated from microbial communities, followed
by assembly into longer fragments and assignment of
gene functions and taxonomic identities. Novel compu-
tational developments are allowing us to increasingly
resolve strain- and species level dierences from metage-
nomic data. Rather than viewing communities as 'bags
of genes', this approach enables us to gain deeper in-
sights into the composition and functioning of microbial
communities. Metagenome-assembled genomes(MAGs)
can be operationally dened by binning metagenomic as-
semblies according to nucleotide composition and depth
of coverage across multiple samples. However, it re-
mains unclear to what extent these operationally dened
MAGs correspond to dierent theoretical concepts of
species, the natural units of evolution and ecology.
Workshop The main focus of the workshop will be
genome-resolved metagenomics, and the opportunities
and pitfalls it brings into microbiology. We will cover
reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomes,
screening the quality of metagenome-assembled genomes
(MAGs), studying their environmental heterogene-
ity through single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), de-
convoluting sub-population genomes using SNV pat-
terns, pangenomics, phylogenomics and visualization
strategies to investigate fundamental questions of mi-

on experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one\s own biological research questions. An
important aspect of the course is to show how genomic
data can be applied to address and answer research
questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, population
biology, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The
students will be trained in the latest bioinformatic meth-
ods to analyze high throughput sequencing data, which
is present in many research projects. The course will
cover basic computing tools required to run command
line applications, processing high throughput sequencing
data of whole genome / exome / restriction site digested
(RAD) DNA for population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general computing
tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line envi-
ronment, bash commands, data formatting using regular
expressions and basic scripting in the unix shell with a
series of examples and exercises using a remote server.
The course introduces bioinformatics software for analy-
sis of RAD-data, and downstream population genetic
analysis of genotype data. The course also introduces
basic and advanced concepts of population genomics
data analysis such as genome/transcriptome assembly,
alignment/mapping, dierential Gene expression, func-

Introduction to bioinformatics for DNA and RNA se-
quence analysis (IBDR01)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-bioinformatics-for -dna-and-rna-sequence-analysis-
ibdr01/
This course will be deliver by Dr Malachi Grith and
Dr Obi Grith (from Washington University) and will
take place in Glasgow City Centre form 28th October -
2nd November 2018
Course Overview:
Analysis of high throughput genome and transcriptome
data is major component of many research projects rang-
ing from large-scale precision medicine eorts to focused
investigations in model systems. This analysis involves
the identication of specic genome or transcriptome
features that predispose individuals to disease, predict
response to therapies, inuence diagnosis/prognosis, or
provide mechanistic insights into disease models. During
this course (IBDR01), students will perform an example
end-to-end bioinformatics analysis of genome (WGS and
Exome) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. Students
will start with raw sequence data for a hypothetical case,
learn to install and use the tools needed to analyze this
data on the cloud, and visualize and interpret results.
After completing the course, students should be in a po-
sition to (1) understand raw sequence data formats, (2)
perform bioinformatics analyses on the cloud, (3) run
complete analysis pipelines for alignment, variant call-
ing, annotation, and RNA-seq (transcriptome analysis
approaches will be a major component of the workshop),
(4) visualize and interpret whole genome, exome and
RNA-seq results, (5) leverage the identication of pas-
senger variants for immunotherapy applications, and (6)
begin to place these results in a clinical context by use
of variant knowledgebases. The data, tools, and analysis
will be most directly relevant to human genomics and
bioinformatics research. However, many of the skills and
concepts covered will be applicable to other human dis-
eases and model organisms. Furthermore, many analysis
concepts covered during the workshop will be broadly
applicable to other \big data" research problems. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-June 1, 2018 EvolDir 117
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
Intended Audience
This workshop is primarily aimed at researchers and
technical workers with a background in biology who
want to learn fundamental bioinformatics skills for ge-
nomics with a particular emphasis on biomedical re-
search applications. The course is essentially a crash
course in bioinformatics for next generation sequence
data analysis. It would also be useful for students with
a computational background who seek an introduction
to genomics technology and analysis approaches. In gen-
eral, it is suitable for anyone working with genome or
transcriptome (RNA-seq) data in the context of disease
research. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own
data or project outlines for discussion. Some time during
the course will be dedicated to consultation with a team
of instructors from the McDonnell Genome Institute.
Monday 29th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1. Introduction to genomics and bioinformat-
ics. In this session, students will be introduced to key
concepts of genomics and their application to genomics
research and precision medicine in cancer. An intro-
duction to next-generation sequencing platforms and
related bioinformatics approaches will also be provided.
Core concepts and tools introduced: fundamentals of
genome and transcriptome analysis, next-generation se-
quencing, precision/personalized medicine approaches
(using cancer as an exemplar disease).
Session 2. Introduction to genomics data, le formats,
QC, and cloud analysis. In this session, students will be
introduced to a hypothetical patient case and related
samples to be analyzed throughout the course. Stu-
dents will be provided with an introduction to the whole
genome, exome, transcriptome and other data sets we
have generated for this test case. Information on where
to get the raw data and how to access it (and other test
data) will be provided. Using this data as an example,
the students will learn fundamentals of next generation
sequence (NGS) data formats. The students will also be
introduced to accessory les needed for analysis includ-
ing reference genomes, reference transcriptomes, and
annotation les. Tools for QC analysis of raw data will
be demonstrated. Since most analysis will be performed
on the cloud, each student will learn how to launch and
log into their own cloud compute environment. Students
will learn how to install bioinformatics tools and learn
to use some of the most broadly useful tool kits for NGS
data. Core concepts and tools introduced: le formats
(Fasta, FastQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF, GTF), bed-
tools, Picard, samtools, fastQC, cloud computing (AWS,EC2).

This course will be delivered by Dr. Owen Wangensteen
and will take place in Glasgow form the 23rd - 27th July
Course Overview:
Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic
tools for assessing biodiversity of natural communities.
Their potential applications include (but are not lim-
ited to) accurate water quality, soil diversity assessment,
trophic analyses of digestive contents, early detection of
non-indigenous species, studies of global ecological pat-
terns and biomonitoring of anthropogenic impacts. This
course will give an overview of metabarcoding proce-
dures with an emphasis on practical problem-solving and
hands-on work using analysis pipelines on real datasets.
After completing the course, students should be in a
position to (1) understand the potential and capabilities
of metabarcoding, (2) run complete analyses of metabar-
coding pipelines and obtain diversity inventories and
ecologically interpretable data from raw next-generation
sequence data and (3) design their own metabarcoding
projects, using bespoke primer sets and custom refer-
ence databases. All course materials (including copies
of presentations, practical exercises, data les, and ex-
ample scripts prepared by the instructing team) will be
provided electronically to participants.

UK FunctionalEcology Nov26-30
Functional ecology from organism to ecosystem: theory
and computation (FEER01)
This course will be delivered by Dr. Francesco de Bello,
Dr. Lars G otzenberger and Dr. Carlos Carmona and
will take places in Glasgow city centre from 26th - 30th
November 2018.
Course Overview: The course will describe dierent
aspects and methods in the eld of functional ecology,
combining theoretical lessons with hands-on real data.
Lectures will provide the theoretical and mathematical
basis for dierent applications of functional traits at
organismal, community and ecosystem levels, with ex-
amples across dierent trophic levels. This will serve as
a basis for exploring the practical tools to connect the
eect of land-use and climate change on biodiversity to
the eect of biodiversity on to multiple ecosystem func-
tions and ecological services. An overview of existing
computational methods, including recent developments
authored by the lecturers, will be provided during the
course and the students will learn how to apply them
using functions and scripts run in R. Students are wel-
come to apply these tools to their own data, or use
the data provided, to be analysed during the courseJune 1, 2018 EvolDir 119
while beneting from advise by the lecturers. As such,
compared to other courses given by the lectures, this
is a slightly a more advanced and data oriented course
which concentrates on detailed and practical aspects
in functional traits related applications, especially com-
putational ones. The aim of the course is to provide
participants with a handy synthesis of existing concepts,
tools and trends in functional ecology and guide them
to apply these tools to their own eld of interest. As
the eld of functional ecology is rapidly expanding, par-
ticipants will be ready to exploit the potential of the
main trait approaches.

UK ModellingEvolution Nov19-23
Structural Equation Modelling for Ecologists and Evo-
lutionary Biologists (SEMR02)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/structural-
equation-modelling-for-ecologists-and-evolutionary-
biologists-semr02/ This course will be delivered by Jon
Lefcheck author of the piecwise package and wiltake
place in lasgow City Centre for the 19th - 23 November
2018
Course Overview: The course is a primer on structural
equation modelling (SEM) and conrmatory path analy-
sis, with an emphasis on practical skills and applications
to real-world data. Structural equation modelling is a
rapidly growing technique in ecology and evolution that
unites multiple hypotheses in a single causal network. It
provides an intuitive graphical representation of relation-
ships among variables, underpinned by well-described
mathematical estimation procedures. Several advances
in SEM over the past few years have expanded its utility
for typical ecological datasets, which include count data,
missing observations, and nested or hierarchical designs.
We will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide
approachable mathematical explanations of the tech-
niques, and cover recent extensions to mixed eects
models and non-normal distributions. Along the way,120 EvolDir June 1, 2018
we will work through many examples from the primary
literature using the open-source statistical software R
(www.r-project.org). We will draw on two popular R
packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan and
piecewiseSEM. Participants are encouraged to bring
their own data, as there will be opportunities through-
out the course to plan, analyze, and receive feedback on
structural equation models.

StatisticalGenomicsProgramming
Jul30
If you are statistical genomicist or work in evolution
and are planning to attend the Joint Statistical Meet-
ings in Vancouver, then there is a short course that
may be of interest to you. Drs Ken Lange, Eric So-
bel, Hua Zhou and I (UCLA Biomath, Human Genetics
and Biostatistics Faculty) will be teaching a Julia Lan-
guage Statistical Computing course with application to
Genomics on Monday 7/30.
The course is suitable for students as well as for statis-
tical genomicists. Programming experience in Julia is
NOT required. Below is a short description. If anyone
has a question they can email me (Janet Sinsheimer -
janets@mednet.ucla.edu). Early registration for JSM
ends 5/31 and early registration for the short course
ends 6/29.
Thanks, Janet

Continuing Education Course ASA Instructor(s): Ken-
neth Lange, UCLA, Janet Sinsheimer, UCLA, Eric So-
bel, UCLA, Hua Zhou, UCLA Challenges in statistical
genomics and precision medicine are enormous. Datasets
are becoming bigger and more varied, demanding com-
plex data structures and integration across multiple bio-
logical scales. Analysis pipelines juggle many programs,
implemented in dierent languages, running on dierent
platforms, and requiring dierent I/O formats. This
heterogeneity erects barriers to communication, data
exchange, data visualization, biological insight and repli-
cation of results. Statisticians spend inordinate time
coding/debugging low-level languages instead of creating
better methods and interpreting results. The benets of
parallel and distributed computing are largely ignored.June 1, 2018 EvolDir 121
The time is ripe for better statistical genomic computing
approaches. This short course reviews current statis-
tical genomics problems and introduces ecient com-
putational methods to (1) enable interactive and repro-
ducible analyses with visualization of results, (2) allow
integration of varied genetic data, (3) embrace parallel,
distributed and cloud computing, (4) scale to big data,
and (5) facilitate communication between statisticians
and their biomedical collaborators. We present statisti-
cal genomic examples and oer participants hands on
coding exercises in Julia as part of the OpenMendel
project (https://openmendel.github.io). Julia is a new
open source programming language with a more exible
design and superior speed over R and Python. R and
Matlab users quickly adapt to Julia.

Title: workshop \the (co-)evolution of genes, languages,
and music from data analyses to theoretical models"
Date: Tues 17 July
Place: Kihara Institute for Biological Research, Yoko-
hama City University (Yokohama, Japan)It aims to clarify the evolution of languages/music and
similarities/dierences from biological evolution through
quantitative datasets. We provide three sessions pre-
senting 1. dispersals of language (and music) relating to
migration histories from genetics side, 2. linguistic and
musicological studies, and 3. theoretical modelings of
cultural and linguistic evolution. Then, we will have a
discussion about what we can learn about the evolution
of languages and music through the dierent types of
the datasets in the nal session.
Speakers in each eld: Genetics: Hiromi Matsumae
(Tokai University), Chiara Barbieri (University of
Zurich), Linguistics: Koji Kawahara (Nagoya University
of Foreign Studies), Musicology: Patrick E. Savage (Keio
University), Theoretical modeling: Takashi Hashimoto
(JAIST), Yasuo Ihara (University of Tokyo)
Discussants: Hiroki Oota (Kitasato University), Kentaro
Shimizu (University of Zurich/Yokohama City Univer-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral122 EvolDir June 1, 2018
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
