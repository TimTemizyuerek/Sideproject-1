Edinburgh EvolutionMaternalEﬀects
May9Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that the CIIE/NERC Sym-
posium on Maternal eﬀects on health and ﬁtness: per-
spectives from the biomedical and evolutionary sciences
will be held on Wednesday, 9th May 2012 in Lecture
Theatre 3, Ashworth Laboratories, University of Edin-
burgh. You can now register via our website: http://-
ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/node/336 This will be a one-day sym-
posium designed to connect evolutionary biology to in-
fection research and gain an interdisciplinary perspec-
tive on challenges to global health.
Maternal eﬀects on health arise when the infection sta-
tus or condition of mothers inﬂuences the health or im-
mune responsiveness of oﬀspring. This is an area of
much active research, but maternal eﬀects have also
been broadly studied outside the context of health, and
in particular evolutionary biologists have addressed the
possibility of adaptive maternal eﬀects, i.e. when moth-
ers take cues from the environment and resource their
oﬀspring to be well-suited to the conditions they will be
born into. This symposium will explore the potential
for cross-fertilisation between the evolutionary biology
and medical perspectives on maternal eﬀects.
Conﬁrmed speakers: Laura Galloway (Virginia, USA)
Sylvain Gandon (Montpellier, France) Romain Gar-
nier (Montpellier, France) Phillip Heeb (Toulouse,
France) Alasdair Leslie (Oxford, UK) Ariel Lindner
(Paris, France) Tessa Roseboom, (Amsterdam, NL) Per

tinyurl.com/ciienercposter If you’d like to attend, you
need to register using the online registration form on

Frankfurt MammalianDiversity
Sep4-8
Dear colleagues,
I am pleased to announce the ﬁrst circular of the an-
nual conference of the German Society of Mammalogy.
This year, this international conference will be hosted
at the Senckenberg Institute and Natural History Mu-
seum in Frankfurt (Main), Germany. Main organiser
is the Conservation Genetics Group, and several other
Senckenberg and BIK-F groups are involved as well.
The conference theme is “The Past, Present and Fu-
ture of Mammalian Diversity”, and hence all topics in
Mammalian Biology are covered in a modern and multi-
disciplinary atmosphere. There will be three days of
conference with talks and poster sessions, divided into
the (non-exclusive) topics:
- past (palaeontology, ancient DNA, phylogeny, phylo-
geography, evolution ...) - present (population struc-
ture and distribution, behaviour, physiology, morphol-
ogy, current policy, other open topics ...) - future (con-
servation, policy making, predictive modelling, climate
change, evolution again ...)
We have invited three plenary speakers to cover and
introduce cutting-edge research in each of these groups
of topics:- Michael Hofreiter ( http://www.york.ac.uk/biology/-
research/ecology-evolution/michael-hofreiter/ ) - Phil
Stephens ( http://www.dur.ac.uk/philip.stephens/-
welcome.htm ) - Herbert H.T. Prins ( http://-
www.reg.wur.nl/UK/Staﬀ/Prins/ )
We are now building the content of the conference web-
site but the main info is already available. Please go
tohttp://www.senckenberg.de/dgs2012 to have a look.
You can already register without commitment, and sub-
mit abstracts. Deadlines are indicated on the confer-
ence website.
We are looking forward to a major event this late sum-
mer, and hope to welcome participants from a diverse
range of topics and backgrounds.

EvolutionPredationAvoidance
Aug18
For anyone potentially attending the 14th International
Behavioral Ecology Congress (ISBE 2012) in Lund,
Sweden ( www.isbe2012lund.org ):
We invite abstract submissions for short talks at the
Post-conference Symposium on THE EVOLUTION OFMECHANISMS FOR AVOIDING PREDATION’, be-
ing held on Saturday 18 August 2012.
Predation is a major source of mortality for many or-
ganisms. Faced with this threat, prey animals should
adjust their foraging activity across situations of high
and low risk; but to do so adaptively they need mecha-
nisms for storing energy, for assessing the threat from a
potential predator and for learning about temporal and
spatial variation in risk. Anti-predator behaviour may
also be associated with emotional states such as fear,
anxiety and stress. It is unclear, however, whether the
psychological and physiological response to predation
risk is important for avoiding predators, or an unavoid-
able constraint that sometimes generates biased esti-
mates of risk and apparently maladaptive behaviour.
For example, depression may be characterized as a fail-
ure to be active when the environment is benign. This
symposium will bring together researchers from both
functional and mechanistic traditions to explore the
evolutionary basis of behavioural, psychological and
physiological responses to predation risk.
We plan to have short talks by 4-6 speakers, to stimu-
late open discussion around speciﬁc points of debate. If
you would like to contribute a talk, please e-mail your
title, an abstract of no more than 150 words and your
contact details to madorganiser@gmail.com. The dead-
line for submissions is 15 March 2012.
We hope to see you in Lund!

Artiﬁcial Life 13 The Thirteenth International Confer-
ence on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems
“Evolution in Action”
July 19-22, 2012, Michigan State University East Lans-
ing, Michigan, USA
www.alife13.org/ You are invited to submit papers to
the upcoming Thirteenth International Artiﬁcial Life
Conference. Please forward this call responsibly.
I. OVERVIEW It is a great pleasure for the BEACON
Center for the Study of Evolution in Action at Michigan
State University to host the 13th International Artiﬁ-
cial Life Conference. Artiﬁcial life (ALife) refers to the
synthesis and simulation of living systems as these oc-
cur in nature and also to possible alternative life forms
and concepts that may not have occurred in natural
evolution-that is, not only in “life-as-we-know-it”, but
also “life-as-it-might-be”. ALife research may use not
only biochemical models, but also computer models and
robotics. The Artiﬁcial Life conference is held every
other year under the auspices of the International Soci-
ety for Artiﬁcial Life (ISAL), alternating with the Eu-
ropean Conference on Artiﬁcial Life.
This year’s major conference theme is “Evolution in
Action.” Life is shaped by evolutionary processes, and
ALife models are a powerful way to investigate and uti-
lize this key characteristic of living systems. We encour-
age submissions by biologists as well as by computer
scientists and engineers, especially interdisciplinary pa-
pers that explore the many ways that evolution and
artiﬁcial life research intersect. Other tracks this year
include Behavior & Intelligence, Collective Dynamics,
Synthetic Biology, and The Humanities and ALife. See
the list of tracks below for examples of topics that may
fall under these headings.

International Palynological Conference (23-30th of Au-

iopc2012/Welcome.html Theme: Cenozoic plants and
biosphere surrounding them
Symposium SS42: Neogene global tectonic and climatic
change as drivers in plant evolution: linking the paly-
nological, palaeobotanical and molecular records
The Neogene period represents the transition to our
modern world, when crucial geographical features such
as topographic relief, drainage patterns and oceanic
currents were laid out. It also represents the run-up
to the ‘icehouse’ world with ﬁnal bleeps of a ‘green-
house’ during the Middle Miocene (c. 15 Ma) and Mid-
dle Pliocene (c. 4 Ma). The combined eﬀects of global
tectonic and climatic change was critical for ﬂoral and
faunal evolution, but also determined present biodiver-
sity patterns, particularly this latter aspect was only
identiﬁed by scientists in recent years. Interdisciplinary
studies that include the geological history, palynology,
palaeobotany and molecular phylogeny potentially can
oﬀer new insights into our understanding of plant evo-
lution and diversiﬁcation. In this session we encourage
palynologists, palaeobotanists and molecular biologists
who work at the interface of their disciplines to present
their research on the Neogene evolution of plants and
algae in geologically dynamic regions from all over the
globe and from both marine and/or continental set-
tings. The insights gained from this type of research are
relevant when modeling the impact of future climatic
change, but also where it concerns drafting guidelines
for conservation policies in regions of high biodiversity.

SexualSelection
Two PhD positions: Quantitative genetics of sexual se-
lection
Bielefeld University, Departments of Evolutionary Bi-
ology and of Animal Behaviour
Salary: E13/65% (approx. 2200 Euro before tax) for
36 months
Starting time: May 2012 or as soon as possible there-
after
Application deadline: 25th March 2012 (or until the
positions are ﬁlled)
Two PhD positions (funded by the German Research
Foundation, DFG) are available at the Departments
of Evolutionary Biology and Animal Behaviour at the
Bielefeld University, Germany, starting in May 2012
or as soon as possible thereafter. The positions are
initially funded for three years. The PhD students
will work in a newly established junior research group
(Emmy Noether program) and the planned research
will be highly collaborative. The research will be largely
empirical using a Siberian locust Gomphocerus sibiricus
as a model species. Most of the work will be laboratory-
based, but ﬁeld projects are also possible.
The ﬁrst PhD project will be focused on the quan-
tiﬁcation of mating preferences of female grasshoppers
and sexual ornamentation of males. Quantiﬁcation of
preferences and ornaments will allow the estimation of
sources of variation (in particular additive genetic vari-
ation) and the genetic correlations between the sexes.
This allows clarifying a long-standing question in the
study of evolution, the evolution of highly elaborate
sexual ornamentation by mate choice.
The second PhD project will focus on the quantiﬁca-
tion of indirect genetic eﬀects in a context of sexual
conﬂict over investment in reproduction. Indirect ge-
netic eﬀects estimate heritable variation that is only
expressed in interacting individuals. They can be es-
timated along with direct genetic eﬀect form extensivemeasurement of related individuals. Indirect genetic
eﬀects are highly relevant for our understanding of evo-
lution, because they can give rise to unexpected dy-
namics when the environment coevolves with the trait
of interest.
We seek highly motivated students with a strong inter-
est in the study of evolution, sexual selection and quan-
titative genetics. Ideal candidates should be motivated
to work with a laboratory population of grasshoppers,
should have an interest in statistical modeling and in
the analysis of complex datasets. Experiences with ﬁeld
work (preferentially with insects), bioacoustical anal-
yses, advanced statistical methods (generalized linear
mixed models), linear algebra and an aﬃnity to statis-
tical computing and programming are beneﬁcial. Ex-
perience with bioinformatics and genomic analysis will
also be helpful and could open avenues to more genomic
analyses. Excellent writing skills are highly desirable.
Our department has a main focus on the ecology and
evolution of behavior and sexual selection using a va-
riety of model systems, including long-standing experi-
ence with studying mating preferences in grasshoppers.
The newly founded Emmy Noether research group will
put a strong focus on modern quantitative genetic tools
for the analysis of data from pedigreed populations.
The aim is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of
coevolution when traits are sex-diﬀerentially expressed.
The Departments of Animal Behaviour and Evolution-
ary Biology at Bielefeld University oﬀer a stimulating
international environment and an excellent research in-
frastructure with access to state-of-the-art techniques;
the working language is English. Successful candidates
will receive training in quantitative genetics, biostatis-
tics, experimental designs and molecular genetics. Re-
sults will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and at
international conferences.
Applications should include a concise statement of re-
search interests and skills and experiences relevant to
the project (one page), curriculum vitae, publication
list and contact details of 2-3 academic referees and
should be submitted before 25th March 2012. Please
send your application as a single pdf ﬁle to Dr Holger
Schielzeth (holger.schielzeth AT uni-bielefeld.de). This
email address is also valid for requests for further infor-
mation.March 1, 2012 EvolDir 17

Imperial
EvolutionBacteriaCommunities
PhD Studentship: Evolutionary dynamics of microbial
communities
Imperial College London, UK. Department of Life Sci-
ences (Silwood Park campus).
Supervisor: Prof. Tim Barraclough
Funding: BBSRC studentship, full support for tuition
fees, all project costs, and an annual tax-free stipend of
£15,740.
Duration: 3 years.
Requirements: You should hold, or realistically expect
to obtain, at least an Upper Second Class Honours de-
gree or equivalent and a Masters degree or equivalent
experience. You should have a strong academic back-
ground in biological or mathematical sciences.
Project outline: Evolutionary theory and experiments
have mostly considered single species or perhaps pairs
of interacting species. Yet, all species live in com-
munities with many other species, and the direction
and amount of evolution is likely to depend greatly
on interactions with other species. Microbial commu-
nities oﬀer a perfect opportunity to test such ideas,
because of their potential for rapid evolution and the
ease with which community membership can be ma-
nipulated. Furthermore, understanding evolution in
microbial communities is vital for many human activ-
ities, including predicting ecosystem responses to cli-
mate change and managing complex gut communities.
You will use ﬁeld and laboratory experiments, molec-
ular labwork and/or mathematical modeling, to test
theories for how species interactions shape evolution-
ary dynamics. Possible topics include the importance
of recombination and horizontal gene transfer for de-
termining which species adapt to new conditions, and
whether selection tends to increase specialization and
positive interactions among species.
Eligibility: UK nationals, EU nationals who have spent
at least 3 years prior to the application resident in the
UK. Non-UK residents might be considered if the re-
search organization can demonstrate a shortage of high-
quality UK candidates.
To apply: Please send a CV and a covering letter ex-
plaining why you are interested and what skills andabilities you could bring to the studentship to Tim Bar-
raclough (t.barraclough@imperial.ac.uk) by the 16th
March 2012.

Duration: 1 + 3 years, the ﬁrst year comprising an
MRes programme.
Requirements: You should hold, or realistically expect
to obtain, at least an Upper Second Class Honours de-
gree or equivalent. You should have a strong academic
background in biological or mathematical sciences.
Project outline: Gut bacteria play a vital role in human
digestion and protection from disease, yet understand-
ing of how these communities inﬂuence host function
is limited, and has been reliant on experiments on ro-
dents. This project will devise new in vitro and in sil-
ico models to replace the use of rodents and to increase
understanding of interactions between gut bacterial di-
versity and human cell function, focusing on the fer-
mentation of ﬁbre and its eﬀects on human cells. The
project aims to understand the evolutionary and eco-
logical dynamics of gut bacterial communities and their
interactions with the host, then to apply that knowl-
edge to managing impacts on human health. You will
work at the interface of microbial ecology and evolu-
tion, medicine and nutritional sciences. You will learn

I am recruiting a Ph.D. student to collaborate in re-
search integrating ecological, evolutionary, and genetic
approaches to investigate the basis of geographic varia-
tion in a highly coevolved ﬁg - ﬁg wasp mutualism and
its associated community of highly specialized insect
and nematode parasites. This National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) funded project is described in greater de-
tail below.
If you are interested in Ph.D work on this study sys-
tem please email a description of your research inter-
ests and interest in this project, curriculum vitae, and
the names of three references to Dr. John Nason, jna-
son@iastate.edu. A complete description of this project
is also available upon request.
The successful applicant will join a team of postdocs
and students in ﬁeld research in the Sonoran Desert of
Baja California and lab research at Iowa State Univer-
sity. The ﬁeld work will be conducted over the course of
multiple, approximately 8 wk trips to Baja. These trips
will involve hiking over rough terrain and occasional
camping in remote settings. The lab work includes the
analysis of ﬁeld collected data, microsatellite analysis of
ﬁg mating patterns and eﬀective population size, and,
potentially, simulation modeling.
In addition to research funding and 100% tuition cover-
age, full graduate student support is available through
a combination of fellowships and research and teaching
assistantships. Students can major in either Ecology

Project Description:
Understanding the costs and beneﬁts of mutualism and
its persistence over time requires both an ecological an
geographical context. The goal of this NSF-supported
project is to understand how plant population size and
reproductive traits are inﬂuenced by environmental gra-
dients and how their variation inﬂuences local- and
geographical-scale dynamics in a pollination mutualism
subject to parasitism.
Our research focuses on a ﬁg-ﬁg wasp mutualism com-
posed of Ficus petiolaris and its species-speciﬁc ﬁg wasp
pollinator. Characteristic of ﬁg-ﬁg wasp interactions,
this ﬁg species is completely dependent on its ﬁg wasp
for pollination while female wasps oviposit in a sub-
set of ﬁg ﬂowers and their oﬀspring feed on develop-
ing ﬁg seeds. Associated with this mutualism is a
well-deﬁned community of parasites comprised of seed-
eating ﬁg wasps that do not function as pollinators,
and a nematode parasite of the pollinator. The geo-
graphical setting for this system, the Sonoran Desert
of Baja California, Mexico, represents the latitudinal
and environmental limits of the ﬁg-ﬁg wasp mutual-
ism in North America. Here, F. petiolaris populations
are often small and spatially isolated and simulation
studies have shown that where ﬁg population size is
small, reliance on species-speciﬁc, short-lived pollina-
tors combined with the unusual, among-tree ﬂowering
asynchrony (but wit hin-tree ﬂowering synchrony) typi-
cal of ﬁgs, leads to a high risk of local pollinator extinc-
tion and mutualism failure. Commonly cited, though
rarely tested, is the hypothesis that where host popula-
tions are small mutualism may be stabilized by repro-
ductive adjustments in the ﬁg; namely increased intra-
crown asynchrony in ﬂower and fruit production and
longer receptivity of individual ﬂowers to pollinators.
We suspect, however, that these reproductive adjust-
ments by the plant may prove costly by potentially ben-
eﬁting to parasites that negatively impact ﬁg seed and
pollinator production. The patchy distribution of F.
petiolaris, its high within-crown ﬂowering asynchrony
(atypical of ﬁgs) and high parasite loads, as well as po-
tential interactions among these factors, make this an
interestingly complex yet well-deﬁned system for evalu-
ating these predictions and the impact of environmen-
tal and biotic stressors on the ﬁtness and persistence of
mutualism.
We will determine the relationship between ﬁg popula-
tion size and bio-climatic variables related to precipi-
tation and temperature, to test hypotheses concerning
the beneﬁts (to pollinators) and costs (of parasites) of
ﬁg reproductive trait variation as a function of popula-tion size, and to quantify how these variables interact
to inﬂuence plant-pollinator-parasite interactions and
mutualism ﬁtness. This research includes a graphical
modeling component to infer conditional interactions
among species, and a simulation modeling component
to evaluate the relative importance of variation in ﬁg
population size, reproductive traits, and parasite abun-
dance on local pollinator persistence. This project will
have important implications

Master thesis: Object exploration and object play in
ravens (Corvus corax) We are looking for an enthusi-
astic student who is interested in investigating object
exploration and object play in ravens (Corvus corax) to
enable a better understanding of raven’s physical and
social cognitive skills. Interestingly, especially young
individuals show a predisposition to explore and ma-
nipulate almost every kind of object they encounter.
In addition, ravens often use non-food items in social
interactions to attract the attention of recipients. The
present study aims to investigate object exploration and
object play during ontogeny in six hand-raised ravens
by carrying out observations in combination with con-
trolled behavioural experiments. The study will start
in June 2012.
We seek a highly motivated person with organizational
skills, able and willing to work independently. You will
learn to work with six hand-raised ravens, set up the ob-
servation schedule, ﬁlm the behavior and experiments,
design and develop a coding scheme and analyze the
behavioral interactions.
We oﬀer the opportunity to work at one of the lead-
ing institutes for bird research in Germany and Europe
and to learn methods in comparative research and be-
havioural biology.

PhD project: Evolution in marine planktonic gas-
tropods
As a consequence of increasing atmospheric CO2, the
world’s oceans are warming and slowly becoming more
acidic. Understanding the implications of these changes
for marine organisms and ecosystems is still in its in-
fancy, but recent studies have shown that calciﬁcation
is one of the physiological processes that is severely
impacted. Euthecosomes (shelled holoplanktonic gas-
tropods) have delicate aragonite shells and have been
identiﬁed as exceptionally vulnerable to rising CO2. It
is well-known that intraspeciﬁc variation is important
for a species adaptive potential, but virtually nothing
is known about critical intraspeciﬁc genetic or pheno-
typic variation in this group. For selected species the
PhD student will examine intraspeciﬁc morphological
and molecular variation. Using naturally occurring gra-
dients in the degree of ocean acidiﬁcation across spatial
and temporal scales, he/she will examine vulnerability
to ocean acidiﬁcation, historical population demogra-
phy, and molecular signatures of selection.
General requirements and skills The successful candi-
date should have a Master’s degree in biology with
an interest in oceanography, marine biology, ecology
& evolution or a related ﬁeld. Excellent command of
the English language (written and verbal) is required.
He/she has a scientiﬁc and critical attitude, excellent
time management and organizational skills, and the
ability to work independently. Experience in molec-
ular genetics, genomics and/or knowledge of NGS ap-
proaches and analyses is a distinct advantage. The ideal
candidate will be highly motivated with a demonstrated
capacity for multidisciplinary research.
We oﬀer A fulltime contract (36 hours per week) for a
period of four years. A maximum salary of circa 39,000
gross per year. All our employees are incorporated into
a pension fund. The successful candidate will be em-
ployed by NCB Naturalis in Leiden. The candidate
will also be aﬃliated to the University of Amsterdam.

I: Molecular Ecology of Lime (Tilia) Populations: Indi-
cators of Ancient Woodland
The United Nations declared 2011 as the Year of Forests
to highlight the importance of woodlands. Lime (both
small-leaved lime, T. cordata and large-leaved lime, T.
platyphyllos) was one of the dominant woodland trees
across much of lowland Britain and north-west Europe
by 6000 yr BP, but is now one of Britain’s rarest na-March 1, 2012 EvolDir 23
tive tree species. Lime trees provide the key habitat for
many rare species of plants, fungi and animals, form-
ing unique communities reliant on lime woods for long-
term survival. In the face of future climate change it is
vitally important that the current status of lime wood-
land is understood to enable informed decision-making
about how best to preserve this unique and ecologically
important part of the landscape. More information
on the project: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/biology/study/-
postgrad/wolﬀ cooke.pdf The project builds on cur-
rent research and collaboration with Dr Ashton (Edge
Hill University) and Dr Roseﬀ (Birmingham Univer-
sity). Molecular methods may encompass available mi-
crosatellite markers, DNA sequencing and Next Gener-
ation Sequencing, using excellent facilities in Newcastle.
Skills gained during the PhD: This project delivers ex-
cellent research training in a wide range of speciﬁc and
general skills: it involves ﬁeld observations, collection of
material, development and use of DNA methods, pop-
ulation genetic data analysis and bioinformatics.
How to apply: This project is suitable for a stu-
dent with a solid background in ecological genetics,

phds2012cooke II: The evolutionary genetics of cyto-
plasmic male sterility in Plantago
This project investigates mechanisms involved in the
maintenance of diversity in a mating system called
gynodioecy, the co-occurrence of hermaphroditic and
male sterile plants in populations. “Evolutionary arms
races” between mutations in plant mitochondrial DNA
(causing male sterility) and nuclear genes (restoring
male fertility) is a classic example of the biology of “self-
ish genetic elements”, an expanding ﬁeld of basic and
cutting edge research in evolutionary genetics. Theoret-
ical models for the maintenance of gynodioecy predict
either long-term balancing selection maintaining varia-
tion, or successive turnover events of the genomes. By
using cutting edge technologies and excellent research
facilities in Newcastle this project will make a big step
forward understanding which of these two mechanisms
is more important in the maintenance of gynodioecy.
The student will investigate the evolutionary genetics
and dynamics of male sterility at the population levelto improve our understanding of the factors involved in
the maintenance of gynodioecy in Plantago. The genus
harbours many gynodioecious species and has an excep-
tionally high rate of mt DNA evolution making this an
optimal model genus for this research. The project can
be adapted to the student’s interests. More information

*Brief summary of the project:*
This project merges genomic, evolutionary and ecologi-
cal approaches, having an emphasis on amphibian pop-
ulations in montane habitats. The model species are
the common frog - Rana temporaria and common toad
- Bufo bufo), which are very sensitive to rapid warm-
ing and vulnerable to the occurrence of novel pathogens
(i.e. Ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis).
The general aim is at establishing a research program
to characterize biodiversity at the intraspeciﬁc level.
Multiple angles will be tackled (i.e. quantitative ge-
netic breeding designs, population genetics, 454 tran-
scriptome sequencing and comparative linkage/QTL-
mapping), aiming at providing molecular tools to track
adaptation to thermal conditions and strong disease-
induced selection in the wild.
The identiﬁcation and monitoring of adaptive genetic
polymorphisms with respect to environmental condi-
tions will be used in the assessment of conservation
value and capacity to adapt to climate change in wild
populations.

COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL PAT-
TERNS OF GENE AND GENOME DUPLICATIONS
IN VERTEBRATES We are looking for an exception-
ally talented and motivated PhD student in evolution-
ary systems biology to work and study under joint su-
pervision of Dr. Lukasz Huminiecki and Prof. Arne
Elofsson at the Department of Biochemistry and Bio-
physics, Stockholm University.
You will live in STOCKHOLM, a beautiful and interna-
tional city with high standard of life and social services,
the Home of the Nobel Prize, oﬀering a vibrant scientiﬁc
environment and rich opportunities for collaborations,
postdoctoral fellowships, or employment in the tech-
nology sector. You will work within the newly created
bioinformatics and computational biology cluster at the
Science for Life Lab, a joint venture between Sweden’s
three top research universities: Karolinska Institutet,
KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Stockholm’s
University.
The project focuses on computational analysis of global
patterns of gene and genome duplications in verte-
brates, and their consequences for signal transduction,
and microRNA (miRNA) network evolution, as well
as expression pattern evolution. We will use path-
way databases and freely available genomic, expression,
and miRNA datasets, to infer architectural changes
of the animal signal transduction and miRNA net-
works after small scale duplications (SSDs) and whole
genome duplications (WGDs). Quantiﬁcation of the
patterns of nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization,
and neofunctionalization will enhance our understand-
ing of the evolutionary forces driving duplicate reten-
tion. The identiﬁcation of the shared animal develop-
mental toolkit is one of the most signiﬁcant and fun-
damental discoveries in biology, and we designate the
toolkit to be a focus area investigated besides the global
perspective.
The methodological toolkit necessary for the project
will consist of phylogenetics and other molecular evo-
lution methods, R statistical package, Bioconductor,
MySQL, and Perl. Unix or Linux experience is
highly desired. Candidates will have undergraduate de-
gree background in biology, biotechnology, biophysics,
molecular biology, mathematical biology, bioinformat-
ics, mathematics, or computer science. Good commandMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 27
of English is required. This is not a pipeline bioinfor-
matics project: the chosen candidate will have a nat-

cedural programming, SQL, statistics, bioinformatics,
and evolutionary theory.

Ecology and Evolution
Texas A&M University Corpus Christi Marine Biology
Program Department of Life Sciences College of Science
and Engineering
Start Date: Fall 2012 or Spring 2013.
I’m starting up a research lab and am going to take 2
graduate students between Fall 2012 and Spring 2013.
Your degree will be from Texas A & M: students at Cor-
pus Christi, College Station, and Galveston all receive
same degree from the same institution.
Description: Research in the lab is focused on the evo-
lution of gene ﬂow restrictions via natural selection,
population connectivity, local adaptation, and evolu-
tion on ecological time scales. I prefer projects to have
at least one applied aspect: marine conservation, ﬁsh-
eries management, alien species, climate change, etc.
My background is in Community Ecology, Population
Genetics, and Phylogenetics and thus research in the
lab is typically cross-disciplinary. Field research will
consist of designed surveys of benthic organisms and
pelagic larvae and experimental manipulations and lab
research will focus on DNA/RNA sequencing and anal-
ysis, as well as sperm-egg compatibility trials and larval
rearing.
My current research program is focused on the ma-
rine ﬂora and fauna of the Hawaiian Islands. Ongoing
projects involve genome-wide DNA sequencing in non-
model species, endemic Hawaiian limpets (Cellana),
the Hawaiian rocky intertidal community, Acanthaster
planci crown-of-thorns sea stars, and the ReefChip mi-
croarray for identifying species composition mixed sam-
ples such as plankton tows. Additional key words: ge-
nomics, speciation, adaptive radiation, diversiﬁcation,
hybridization, admixture, larval dispersal, biostatistics,
molecular tool development, population genetic simu-
lation models Lab Resources: Staﬀed high-throughput
genomics core lab with capacity to prepare samples
for Sanger, 454, Ion Torrent, or Illumina sequencing
of DNA or cDNA (genome scans, transcriptomes, etc).
High throughput microarray processing. Real time
PCR. Microsats, etc. On campus high performance
computing facility, access to Texas A&M College Sta-
tion high performance computing facility. In lab desk-top supercomputers: Mac and Linux/Windows.
In Hawaii, I collaborate with the ToBo Lab (Rob Too-
nen & Brian Bowen) at the Hawaii Institute of Marine
Biology/University of Hawaii, and will have access to
their facilities at HIMB which are similar to that de-
scribed for TAMUCC above.
Funding: 9mo TA positions are available and you will
receive two months of summer salary for the ﬁrst three
years. Salary is dependent upon experience and pro-
gression through the PhD program. Upon achieving
candidacy, TA’s are paid $2200 per month. I will en-
courage and assist all students in acquiring funding for
salary and research.
What you can expect: Until course requirements are
completed, Fall and Spring semesters will be spent in
Texas. Summers will likely be spent in Hawaii. In
addition to Corpus Christi, you can take classes at
Galveston or College Station either in person or via
tele-conferencing system.

UAuckland 3 CulturalEvolutionApplications are invited for three fully-funded 3-year
PhD studentships based in the Department of Psychol-
ogy at the University of Auckland to begin in 2012.
The students will be supervised by Dr Quentin Atkin-
son and Professor Russell Gray.
PhD Studentship 1: Cultural evolution of coopera-
tion in the Paciﬁc Cooperating to sustainably manage
shared resources is vital for our long-term survival. Yet
our ability to cooperate in large groups of non-kin re-
mains an evolutionary puzzle. Recent research indi-
cates that human cooperation is inherently cultural.
Cultural norms and institutional features have been
shown to promote cooperative behaviour and successful
resource management. However, the way these systems
evolve and interact through time and their importance
relative to other contextual factors remains poorly un-
derstood. This project will use experimental methods
together with ethnographic data and comparative phy-
logenetic analysis to trace how cooperative norms and
institutions have evolved over the course of Paciﬁc his-
tory. This work promises a better understanding of how
cooperative cultural features emerge and co-evolve and
their importance in human evolution.
The successful applicant will have experience in experi-
mental economics and a strong background in evolu-
tionary theory. The applicant will also have (or be
demonstrably able to acquire) proﬁciency in computa-
tional modelling and comparative phylogenetic meth-
ods. Fieldwork experience and familiarity with Pa-
ciﬁc language/culture is also desirable. Although the
project is based in Auckland, preparedness to spend
periods in the ﬁeld at locations across the Paciﬁc is es-
sential. Willingness to work as part of a team is also
important. The studentship is part of a larger inter-
disciplinary project examining cultural evolution in the
Paciﬁc and involves visits to two labs in North America.
PhD Studentship 2: Cultural evolution of religion in
the Paciﬁc One important aspect of human culture that
may function to promote cooperation is religion. To
fully understand the role that religion plays in the emer-
gence of human societies we need to be able to track
the evolution of religious features through time. This
project will use ethnographic data to document vari-
ation in religious traits across the Paciﬁc. Combining
this data with tools from cultural phylogenetics and
ﬁndings from the project above, this studentship will
test hypotheses about how religious beliefs and prac-
tices evolve and their co-evolution with ecology and so-
cial morphology.
The successful applicant will have experience work-
ing with cross-cultural ethnographic data and a strong
background in evolutionary theory. The applicant will30 EvolDir March 1, 2012
also have (or be demonstrably able to acquire) pro-
ﬁciency in computational modelling and comparative
phylogenetic methods. Familiarity with Paciﬁc ethnog-
raphy and experience in database construction is de-
sirable. Willingness to work as part of a team is also
important. The studentships form part of larger in-
terdisciplinary projects examining cultural evolution in
the Paciﬁc.
PhD Studentship 3: Cultural evolution of religion A
key function of religion is the codiﬁed transmission of
social and cultural knowledge. This studentship will
test hypotheses about how religious texts and practices
evolve using computational phylogenetic methods.
The successful applicant will have experience working
with databases and a strong background in evolutionary
theory. The applicant will also have (or be demonstra-
bly able to acquire) proﬁciency in computational mod-
elling and comparative phylogenetic methods. Willing-
ness to work as part of a team is also important.

UAuckland Metagenomics
PhD position in Molecular Ecology and Evolution
Metagenomics in a model ecosystem
Supervisors: Assoc. Prof. Richard Newcomb, Plant& Food Research and University of Auckland Assoc.
Prof. Alexei Drummond, University of Auckland As-
soc. Prof. Thomas Buckley, Landcare Research and
University of Auckland
The development of metagenomic techniques have be-
gun to allow the testing of many fundamental ques-
tions in ecology and evolution across all phyla simulta-
neously. Such questions include: What species are at a
site? Where are species distributed? and What factors
impact species distribution? Fundamentally: Why are
species where they are? While metagenomic techniques
are becoming routinely used for soil microbes in terres-
trial ecosystems, the extension of this approach to other
groups of organisms is yet to be rigorously examined.
We have been establishing Hauturu (Little Barrier Is-
land) in New Zealand’s Hauraki Gulf as a model ecosys-
tem in which to develop new genomic tools for address-
ing both fundamental and applied questions within
ecology. To evaluate the drivers of species distribu-
tion we are investigating many abiotic factors, such as,
temperature, altitude, and humidity, as well as biotic
factors, such as the distribution of other species. Par-
ticular applications of these new metagenomic technolo-
gies include eﬀective and eﬃcient evaluation of species
compositions and distributions in order to understand
the impacts of climate change, biological invasions, dis-
turbance and restoration. This strategic initiative is
funded by the Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecol-
ogy and Evolution. Stakeholders for the project in-
clude Department of Conservation, Auckland Council,
and local iwi (Ngati Manuhiri), and internationally this
project is part of the Network of Genomic Observato-
ries.
This PhD programme will address whether a metage-
nomic approach can be extended from microbes into
invertebrates, plants and perhaps even vertebrates
through next generation amplicon sequencing of DNA
extracted from common environmental substrates such
as soil and leaf litter. We already have a signiﬁcant
database of sequences from classically-collected and
Sanger-sequenced invertebrates and plants from a set
of sites across Hauturu, with further sampling under-
way. The candidate, if eligible, will enrol for a PhD
within the School of Biological Sciences, University of
Auckland, but be based for a majority of their time at
Plant & Food Research in Mt Albert, Auckland and to
a lesser extent at Landcare Research in Tamaki, Auck-
land and the University of Auckland for bioinformatics.
The Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and
Evolution through the University of Auckland will pro-
vide a stipend of NZ$25K plus university fees p.a. for
three years. The candidate should have proven skills in
molecular ecology techniques and analysis of molecularMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 31

UBern EvolutionCooperation
PhD POSITION IN BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY
Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern,
Switzerland
’GENETIC BASIS OF COOPERATION’: The aim of
this PhD-project is to investigate the genetic basis of
cooperative behaviour in highly social African cichlids.
These ﬁsh breed cooperatively in large family groups
and have turned into a model species for studies of
social evolution based on detailed information about
their ecology and behaviour, excellent possibilities for
behavioural experiments and recent sequencing of their
full genome. We shall pursue a multidisciplinary ap-proach to study the genetic control of cooperative be-
haviour. This involves behavioural experiments with
oﬀspring obtained from a large-scale breeding experi-
ment, analysis of the behavioural data using quantita-
tive genetics tools and identifying candidate genes re-
sponsible for variation in cooperative behaviour by an
ecological genomics approach. Eligible candidates will
have a master’s degree (or Diplom) in Biology and re-
search experience in animal behaviour and a genuine
understanding of evolutionary theory. Practical skills
in molecular genetics techniques, the application of sta-
tistical models and empirical work with ﬁsh would be
beneﬁcial, but they are not a precondition. The project
will be mostly based in Bern, but will involve collabora-
tion with two co-supervisors, Nadia Aubin-Horth (Uni-
versity Laval, Canada) and Mathias K¨ olliker (Univer-
sity of Basel, Switzerland). The position is part of the
Doctoral Research Program (“ProDoc”) funded by the
Swiss National Science Foundation SNF on “Proximate
and ultimate causes of cooperation” and will connect up
to 30 PhD students working on animal cooperation by
a research network. Supervisor: Barbara Taborsky.
The position is for three years and should preferably
start in spring 2012.
The successful candidate will join a bustling research
environment consisting of ca. 15 PhD-students and
advanced research staﬀ, ﬁve technicians and a vary-
ing number of master’s students and guest scientists.
Besides this Behavioural Ecology group, the Institute
of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Bern
comprises research groups in Aquatic Ecology (Ole
Seehausen), Community Ecology (Wolfgang Nentwig),
Conservation Biology (Raphael Arlettaz), Evolution-
ary Ecology (Heinz Richner) and Population Genetics
(Laurent Excoﬃer). Salaries will follow the schemes of
the national funding organization of Switzerland.
Closing date: Open until ﬁlled, but all application ma-
terials, including CV, a summary of research experi-
ence, copies of any published or in-press papers, and
two letters of recommendation should be received by
15 March 2012 to ensure full consideration. Candidates
should indicate in a cover letter when they could take
up the position. Please send all application material

We obtained funding for a research project that aims
to elucidate whether or not positive Darwinian selection
on females to mimic the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC)
proﬁle of their host is a major force that drives the evo-
lution of CHC proﬁles in a group of cleptoparasitic and
parasitoid insects: cuckoo wasps (Hymenoptera: Chry-
sididae). We intend to combine behavioral experiments
with a phylogeny-based statistical analysis that com-
pares CHC proﬁles of cuckoo wasps and their distantly
related hosts. The behavioral experiments are meant to
demonstrate whether or not host-parasite CHC proﬁle
similarity is causally interrelated with the host’s behav-
ior against cleptoparasites and parasitoids.
The project is coordinated by the Evolutionary Chem-March 1, 2012 EvolDir 33

Hello,
I have just advertised a funded PhD position on
Findaphd, deadline 16 March (funding for UK stu-
dents only). (see http://www.ﬁndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=36260 )
The advertisement focuses on the ’evolution of viru-
lence’ question, however I want to stress that the fo-
cus will be very much on the bacterial traits that un-
derlie virulence, with a big emphasis on social, co-
operative traits (expression of secreted virulence fac-
tors), and on plasticity (regulatory control of virulence
factors). For more general info on what we do, see
brown.bio.ed.ac.uk. Any questions, please email.
best wishes, Sam Brown
Findaphd advert: Molecular, ecological and evolution-
ary dynamics of bacterial virulence.
Bacterial pathogens are overwhelmingly opportunistic
and typically grow in distinct environments causing no
harm to humans. The major challenge in this pro-
posal is to build new theory for virulence evolution in
opportunistic pathogens, with a focus on food-borne
pathogens, in particular pathogenic strains of E. coli.
The evolution of virulence is a major focus in evo-
lutionary biology, and has resulted in a large body
of theory based on the assumption that virulence is
a result of selection for virulence factors (VFs) that
enhance within-host growth, survival or between-host
transmission. While this theory has met with suc-
cess for specialist pathogens (e.g. malaria), for many
opportunistic pathogens these proposed countervailing
growth/transmission beneﬁts of VF expression are dif-
ﬁcult to identify in hosts, casting a large body of theory
into doubt. To answer this challenge, we will develop
and test a novel theoretical framework for virulence
dynamics across multiple environments (from farm to
fork). This project promises to deliver a signiﬁcant redi-
rection of virulence evolution theory, to capture the en-
vironmental and regulatory complexity of virulence in
bacterial opportunistic pathogens.
In addition to a core theoretical component, experimen-
tal investigations will also be encouraged, to foster an
integrative training spanning molecular microbiology,
systems biology, ecology and evolution.34 EvolDir March 1, 2012

Description: Advances in molecular evolutionary dy-
namics (termed phylodynamics’) has transformed our
understanding of many of the most serious viral diseases
of humans and animals (e.g., Smith 2009; Rambaut
2008). The rapid transition to next generation sequenc-
ing technologies has oﬀered an opportunity to increase
the level of detail of these studies by orders of mag-
nitude. However, although new computational tech-
nologies bring beneﬁts (multi-core GPGPUs; Suchard
& Rambaut, 2009), current inference frameworks arelanguishing behind the deluge of data and we are at a
juncture where urgent analytical advances are required
to use it eﬀectively.
This project would involve developing computational
advances to apply evolutionary dynamical model to
these data in novel and imaginative ways to apply the
strengths of next generation sequencing to the unique
properties of RNA virus - namely, very small genomes
and very rapid rates of evolution. Of speciﬁc need are
methods to study the evolving diversity within indi-
vidual infections of human immunodeﬁciency virus to
understand clinical outcomes like the evolution of drug
resistance and interactions with host immune response.
Theoretically related problems will be studied at the
level of populations where unprecedented genomic data
is available for inﬂuenza A virus of humans and live-
stock, challenging our analytical ability.

Project description: Bumblebees are among the most
important pollinating insects. Many species and popu-
lations have recently suﬀered drastic declines, with im-
pacts on plant biodiversity and agriculture. Next to
habitat loss, parasite pressure is one of the potential
causes of these species declines. In particular rapidly
adapting viral diseases, which might readily jump be-
tween host species, may drive host population dynam-
ics. Viruses are important parasites of honeybees, but
have so far been little studied in bumblebees. The aim
of this project is to investigate the virulence and host
speciﬁcity of newly identiﬁed bumblebee viruses. The
project will combine ﬁeldwork with experimental infec-
tion experiments to determine the eﬀects of viral in-
fections on bee health. From this starting point, the
degree of host-speciﬁcity - and thus the risk for disease
emergence - may be assayed directly through experi-
mental evolution. Using phylogenetic methods, exper-
imental results can be compared to the demographic
history of viruses in the ﬁeld to test whether experi-
mental evolution recapitulates natural evolution. This
project will combine ﬁeldwork in the UK with exper-
imental infection assays in the lab. The work will
heavily rely on molecular techniques, such as quanti-
tative PCR and sequencing, for quantifying infections
and for studying viral sequence evolution. The student
will be trained in these methods and will be closely
involved with the disease group at Tremough, includ-
ing Prof. Mike Boots, Prof. Angus Buckling, Dr.

We are inviting applications for a NERC-funded PhD
studentship to commence October 2012. For eligible
students the award will cover UK/EU tuition fees and
an annual stipend (in 2011/12 this was £13,590 for full-
time students, pro rata for part-time students) for at
least three years. Applicants with a strong academic
record and interest in species interactions within natu-
ral and agricultural settings are encouraged to apply.
Project title: It’s a phage-eat-bacterial world: Test-
ing coevolutionary dynamics within a tri-trophic plant-
bacteria-phage system
School: University of Exeter, Cornwall campus, Bio-36 EvolDir March 1, 2012
Sciences in the Centre for Ecology & Conservation
Supervisor: Dr Britt Koskella
Project details: Coevolution between hosts and para-
sites is fundamental to both biodiversity and ecosystem
functioning. Most coevolutionary studies have exam-
ined the interaction between two players (e.g., a preda-
tor and its prey), but it is clear that these interactions
typically happen within a network of species interac-
tions. Microbial systems provide an exciting opportu-
nity to examine these more realistic but intrinsically
complex dynamics. As well as excellent model systems,
microbial systems are themselves of major importance
to the health of human, agricultural, and natural popu-
lations. A key challenge is to understand how microbial
communities are inﬂuenced by interactions with both
their eukaryotic hosts and their viral parasites (bacte-
riophages).
This project focuses on a natural association among
plants, bacteria (including a prevalent and devastating
tree pathogen), and parasitic phages. This tri-trophic
interaction is ideal for examining multi-player coevo-
lutionary dynamics in that adaptation to one antago-
nist might critically alter the interaction with the other.
The approach will be to combine studies of natural pop-
ulation dynamics with experimental coevolution to test
how bacterial communities change as a function of sea-
sonality, selection by phages, and the plant immune
response. The results will be of both basic and applied
interest, as understanding these interactions is key to
predicting disease outbreaks in natural and agricultural
systems.
Training: The student will gain training in novel tech-
niques relevant to both academic research and biotech-
nology, ranging from experimental evolution of mi-
crobes both in vitro and in vivo, to bioimaging of plant
responses to bacterial pathogens, to metagenomics and
bioinformatic analysis of bacterial and phage communi-
ties. The studentship will include lab, greenhouse, and
ﬁeld work across the UK and Europe, and will beneﬁt
from previous frozen libraries of natural bacteria and
phage populations for a quick start to the project. The
student will join a lab group, co-supervised by Prof An-
gus Buckling, of 3 post-doctoral researchers and 3 PhD
students, all working on the evolution and ecology of
microbes. In addition, they will beneﬁt from lab meet-
ings with the disease group at Tremough, including Prof
Mike Boots and Dr Michiel Vos.
Eligibility: You must have obtained, or be about to ob-
tain, a First or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree,
or the equivalent qualiﬁcations gained outside the UK,
in a relevant subject. The studentship is only available
to UK and other EU nationals (due to funding criteria,EU nationals who have not been resident in the UK for

UExeter DrosophilaTE Evolution
PhD Project - Centre for Ecology & Conservation, Uni-
versity of Exeter, Cornwall Campus
Sex, selﬁsh genes, and insecticide resistance
Insecticide resistance is rapidly reaching global ﬁxation
in many pest populations, but we know little aboutMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 37
how resistance is achieved and spread. We will ex-
amine the mechanism and ﬁtness consequences of in-
secticide resistance in the ﬂy Drosophila melanogaster,
where resistance is conferred by an Accord retrotrans-
poson (TE) inserted into a cytochrome P450 genes (the
Cyp6g1 gene). TE’s are jumping genes that selﬁshly
replicate within a host genome. The Accord TE up-
regulates Cyp6g1 gene expression facilitating detoxiﬁ-
cation of DDT and it also causes females to pack eggs
with more RNA, which increases egg survival. However
there are sexually antagonistic eﬀects of the allele be-
cause in males, up-regulation of Cyp6g1 can decrease
male mating-success and alter male aggression.
Recently, several new TE insertions and duplications of
Accord alleles have been discovered with a clear evolu-
tionary progression. So we now have additional jump-
ing genes inserting into older jumping genes, indicat-
ing this genomic region is a hot-spot for TE-insertions.
Intriguingly, these new insertions and duplications are
associated with large sex diﬀerences in resistance to
DDT, but we do not understand how a singe inser-
tion can have such diﬀerent impacts on males and fe-
males. Our previous work has shown that there are
large sexually antagonistic eﬀects of Accord and that
there are large epistatic eﬀects as well, such that the
ﬁtness consequences of resistance depends on genetic
background and ﬂy gender. Understanding how resis-
tance alleles spread requires a complete understanding
of these sex-speciﬁc and background eﬀects. To that
end, this project will build on previous results to fur-
ther investigate the mechanisms underlying these dif-
ferences, while also characterising the ﬁtness eﬀects of
recent novel TE-alleles discovered in our lab. This is a
unique opportunity to examine the impact of multiple
jumping genes inserting into the promoter region of a
single P450 gene.
The impact of these additional TE-insertions on the
level of up-regulation of Cyp6g1 in male and female D.
melanogaster will be assessed. In addition, the amount
RNA deposited in eggs by females carrying resistance
alleles, and the impact on male aggressive behaviour
and mating success will be quantiﬁed in relation to the
diﬀerent TE-insertions. Finally, the proposed link be-
tween DDT-resistance and juvenile hormone will be in-
vestigated to see if this causes the sex diﬀerences noted
previously. This novel and exciting project would suit
a student with interests in the molecular basis of sexual
conﬂict and how changes in single genes gave can have
massive phenotypic eﬀects.
This project will be undertaken at the Centre for Ecol-
ogy & Conservation at the Cornwall Campus ( http:/-
/biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/cec/ ), and a background in
evolutionary or molecular biology would be advanta-geous. Applicants must be from the EU and will work

UExeter InsectFitnessMaximization
A fully funded NERC PhD position is available from
October 2012 at the Centre for Ecology and Conserva-
tion at the University of Exeter’s Cornwall Campus.
Social networks in wild insects
This project will investigate the possibility that wild in-
sects have networks of places and/or other individuals
that they interact with in a non-random fashion. An
important issue in animal reproduction is to identify
a mate that will maximise the ﬁtness of the searching
individual or their oﬀspring. Many diﬀerent cues have
been identiﬁed that are used for both mate ﬁnding and
mate choice, but we have no idea whether non-social
invertebrates may preferentially interact with a group
of preferred conspeciﬁcs rather than simply encounter-
ing other individuals at random. This study will be
integrated with a project we have to record the lives of
every individual in a natural population of ﬁeld crick-
ets (Gryllus campestris) in a ﬁeld in Northern Spain.
All individuals are tagged and DNA ﬁngerprinted and
a network of video cameras records their movements
and interactions (see www.wildcrickets.org ). The stu-
dentship will test hypotheses about movement, social
interactions and behaviour in this unique study system.
It requires a highly self motivated, resourceful and am-
bitious student with a strong interest in evolution and
behaviour, prepared to work in Spain for several weeks
a year and not afraid of using quantitative techniques
to analyse data.

UGroningen Evolutionary Theory
PhD (4 years) or Post-doc (3 years) position in Theo-
retical Evolutionary Ecology
“Causes and consequences of variation in dispersal be-
haviour”
Organization
This research project is a collaborative eﬀort of the
research groups Theoretical Biology and Behavioural
Ecology and Self-organization (BESO), which both are
part of the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary
Studies at the University of Groningen (The Nether-
lands). The research is funded by a TopGrant (ALW-
TOP/11.017) allocated to Prof. Jan Komdeur from the
Netherlands Science Foundation (NWO).
Job description
In many organisms individuals diﬀer systematically in
their dispersal behaviour. Moreover, individual vari-
ation in dispersal is correlated with other traits, in-
cluding metabolism, activity, aggressiveness, boldness,
sociability, behavioural ﬂexibility and learning ability.
Although such correlation structures (“dispersal syn-
dromes”) have been described for many species, nei-
ther their evolutionary emergence nor their ecological,
evolutionary and genetic consequences are well under-
stood. By means of a theoretical approach (using an-
alytical models and individual-based computer simula-
tions) the project will address questions such as: Why
are the dispersal syndromes in diﬀerent species remark-
ably similar in some respects and remarkably diﬀerent
in others? What are the consequences of variation in
dispersal for social evolution (e.g., cooperative breed-
ing) and the mating system? What are the implications
of non-equilibrium dynamics for the genetic structure
of a population and for the estimation of pedigrees, re-
latedness and ﬁtness?The project is designed as a 4-year PhD project; how-
ever, we also welcome applications from exceptional
post-doctoral researchers for a 3-year position. The
close collaboration between theoretical and behavioural
researchers, along with access to the long-term Sey-
chelles warbler dataset, provides a unique opportunity
to forge a link between conceptual models and real-
world data.
Qualiﬁcations
- MSc in Theoretical Biology, Behavioural Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology or related discipline (for a PhD
candidate) or a PhD in any of these disciplines (for a
postdoc).
- Research experience in areas related to model devel-
opment and analysis, individual-based simulations or
dynamical systems (desired for a PhD candidate; es-
sential for a postdoc).
- Working knowledge of programmes like C++,
Maple/Mathematica/Matlab or R; excellent program-
ming skills (desired for a PhD candidate; essential for
a postdoc).
- Excellent academic record (as shown by a list of ex-
amination marks); proven ability to plan and prioritize
work and to work to and meet deadlines; strong com-
mitment to excellence in research and teaching.
- Ability to develop creative approaches to problem
solving; creativity, curiosity, and ambition; proactive
attitude; ability to implement new methods and ideas.
- Excellent organisational and interpersonal skills; abil-
ity to work in a team consisting of scientists, students

with English as our operational language. Our gradu-
ate school oﬀers a creative and stimulating environment
and is very rich in seminars, courses and possibilities to
interact with other scholars and students (see “ http:/-
/www.ebc.uu.se/education/” ) – graduate students re-
cently ranked Uppsala University in ﬁrst place among
all institutions in Europe in the subject of biology (CHE
European ranking). Uppsala University is the oldest
university in Scandinavia and the city of Uppsala is a
vibrant student town with beautiful surroundings con-
veniently situated 35 minutes by train from Stockholm.
*Brief research outline: **Although males and females
share much of the same genome, selection can be dis-
tinct in the two sexes. Sexually antagonistic loci are
those loci where selection acts in opposing directions
in the two sexes. This PhD student position is aimed
at improving our emerging understanding of the **ar-
chitecture of sexually antagonistic genetic variation**.
Insects (seed beetles and/or fruit ﬂies) will serve as
main model systems and the research will primarily
employ quantitative genetic techniques. The research
will establish a series of discrete genotypes and use
crosses between these to analyse, describe and under-
stand the architecture of sexually antagonistic genetic
variation. Traits in focus are sex speciﬁc measures oflife history traits (especially metabolism) and integra-
tive traits such as life-time ﬁtness. ***
*This PhD *position forms a part of a new project
on genetic conﬂict, funded by the European Research
Council and the Swedish Research Council. The en-
tire project will employ some 6-8 PhD students and
postdocs, apart from a full time TA and the PI, and
will strongly encourage interactions and collaborations
within the group.
*Salary and appointment*: The duration of the PhD
training period is four full years. The successful candi-
date will receive a postgraduate fellowship the ﬁrst year
(currently 15.500 SEK/month) and a postgraduate po-
sition year 2-4 (currently 23.300 – 26.400 SEK/month)
including full social beneﬁts.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate should have a rel-
evant MSc degree (or equivalent) in biology/ecology.
*Qualiﬁcations and merits*: We seek highly moti-
vated candidates with a documented and strong inter-
est in evolutionary biology and/or evolutionary genet-
ics, preferably also with past experience of quantitative
genetic analyses and an understanding of life history
theory and sexual selection. Experience of laboratory
work with insects is a merit as is previous experience of
scientiﬁc writing and publishing. Because the holder of
this position will collaborate and interact closely with
other members of the group, we will put emphasis on
both independence and ability to collaborate.The ap-
plicant is expected to have a good knowledge (spoken
and written) of the English language.
*To apply:*Applications should include (1) personal in-

Project title: Mapping deciduousness in diploid straw-
berry - insights into the evolution of the perennial cycle
School: School of Biological Sciences
Supervisors: Professor Nick Battey (University of
Reading) and Dr Richard Harrison (East Malling Re-
search)
Abstract: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technolo-
gies are revolutionising the study of non-model systems.
It is now possible to understand the genetic architec-
ture underpinning some of the most agriculturally im-
portant aspects of plant growth and development in
a comparatively short amount of time. This project
will use an NGS approach, combined with genetic link-
age mapping to understand the molecular mechanisms
controlling deciduousness, a key trait in the perennial
cycle, utilising the diploid strawberry as a model sys-
tem for Rosaceous crops. There is a strong emphasis on
bioinformatics, including sequence assembly and com-
parative genomics as well as practical laboratory work
involving the use of a new Illumina sequencer at East
Malling Research.
Eligibility: Applicants should hold or expect to gain a
minimum of a 2:1 Bachelors Degree in a relevant sub-
ject. Due to restrictions on the funding this studentship
is only open to candidates from the UK/EU.
Funding Details: The studentship commences in Oc-
tober 2012, is three years in duration and will cover
Tuition Fees and Research Council minimum stipend.

I am looking for a PhD candidate to study physiological
ﬂexibility as an evolved trait. Changes in physiology
enable adaptation to changing environments (physio-
logical adaptation) and regulate behavioral adaptation.
The main aim of our research group is to understand
the evolved physiological mechanisms that allow ani-
mals to behave adaptively in a changing environment.
(See full project summary at end of email).
The student will be supervised by Dr. Carsten
Schradin and be part of the research group study-
ing African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio;
see www.stripedmouse.com and www.ieu.uzh.ch/-
research/behaviour/endocrinology.html ).
I am seeking a highly-motivated, independent candi-
date with excellent organizational skills. Strong intel-
lectual skills are desired. Technical skills are mandatory
to run the respirometry ﬁeld laboratory.
The ideal candidate has a background in eco-
physiology, behavioral endocrinology or behavioral
ecology. Of advantage is experience with animal han-
dling, with respirometry, with hormone analyses, in ex-
perimental design and statistical analysis of data. The
working language in my group is English.
The student will be based at the Department of An-
imal Behavior, Institute of Evolutionary Biology and
Environmental Studies at the University of Zurich.
In Zurich the PhD student has to work in the hor-
mone laboratory, visit courses (12 ECS) and give lec-
tures to fulﬁll the conditions of the PhD program
in evolutionary biology: http://www.evobio.uzh.ch/-
index.html . Zurich is a highly attractive city in beau-
tiful surroundings, with a multinational population,
and many educational and recreational opportunities
(http://www.zuerich.com ).
Data will be collected in the ﬁeld in South Africa, where
the PhD student has to spend two ﬁeld seasons of ap-44 EvolDir March 1, 2012
prox. 9 months each. In the ﬁeld, the candidate has
to run independently the respirometry laboratory and
conduct ﬁeld experiments with the help of ﬁeld assis-
tants.
The ﬁrst 6 months will be a trial period during which
time the student has to visit courses in Zurich and de-
velop a research proposal. After the trial period the
position can be extended for another 2 years. This
will depend on 1. the quality of the student, and 2.
which position the supervisor (Dr. Schradin) will have
in 2013.
The salary follows the Swiss National Science Foun-
dation scale and is very competitive, especially for
somebody spending signiﬁcant time in South Africa
(CHF 41 000 for the ﬁrst year, CH 44 400 for the
second year; this is 34 000 Euro during the ﬁrst
and 37 000 Euro during the second year). The stu-
dent is expected to apply for funding for an addi-
tional year, for example from the Forschungskredit

Insect phylogenetics and evolution
I am seeking a Ph.D. student to join my labora-
tory studying the evolution and ecology of parasitoid
ﬂies ( www.wright.edu/biology/department/directory/-
faculty/stireman/ ). While the speciﬁc focus of the
dissertation research is negotiable, the research assis-
tantship will require contributing to a collaborative,
NSF funded project focused on understanding the phy-
logenetics and evolution of parasitoid ﬂies in the fam-
ily Tachinidae. This important and fascinating group
of insects has experienced a recent explosive radiation
in diversity and exhibits an incredible diversity of re-
productive strategies and host associations. However,
the origins, relationships, and biogeography of the fam-
ily are poorly understood (See the NSF project sum-
mary below for a brief overview of our general goals).
The successful applicant will develop a thesis research
project on insect evolution and systematics using phy-
logenetic, genomic, and comparative methods and will
have the opportunity to participate in international col-
lecting expeditions to Australia, S. Africa, SE Asia, and
elsewhere.
At least four years of support are available through
a combination of graduate research and teaching as-
sistantships, and the student may start as early as
Summer 2012. The student will be enrolled in Wright
State’s Interdisciplinary Environmental Sciences Ph.D.
Program. Application requirements include: Bachelors
degree in Biology, Entomology, or related ﬁeld; GRE
scores within the last 5 y; minimum IBT TOEFL score
of 100 and ability to pass a verbal English test (for-March 1, 2012 EvolDir 45
eign students only). Preferred qualiﬁcations include:
Masters degree or equivalent experience; a strong back-
ground in Entomology, with interest and/or experience
in insect systematics and evolution; good communica-
tion skills. The current stipend is approx. $23,000 on
a 12 month basis.

Project Summary: Collaborative Research: Phylogeny
and Evolution of World Tachinidae (Diptera)
Tachinidae are the most diverse and important group of
insect parasitoids outside the Hymenoptera. They are
also among the youngest and most rapidly diversifying
families of ﬂies. All tachinids are endoparasitoids, at-
tacking as a group at least 14 arthropod orders. They
parasitize this diversity of hosts with a remarkable array
of oviposition and reproductive strategies. As enemies
of other insects, particularly herbivores, tachinids play
important ecological roles in both natural and man-
aged ecosystems. Despite their diversity and impor-
tance, there has never been a comprehensive phyloge-
netic study of the family. Relationships among tribes
and subfamilies are obscure and the family is among themost taxonomically diﬃcult of Diptera. The lack of a
robust and predictive classiﬁcation of Tachinidae has
hindered both basic and applied research on the fam-
ily. The goals of the proposed research are: (1.) Robust
reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships among ma-
jor tachinid lineages. (2.) Production of a stable, pre-
dictive classiﬁcation of Tachinidae. (3.) Focused phy-
logenetic analyses of two biologically interesting and
agronomically important groups, the tribe Blondeliini
and the subfamily Phasiinae. (4.) Analysis of the evo-
lution of reproductive traits, oviposition strategy, and
host associations and their eﬀects on diversiﬁcation and
biological control success. And (5.), dissemination of
taxonomic and biological information on Tachinidae.
Intellectual Merit: A sound tachinid phylogeny and a
reliable taxonomic infrastructure are necessary to un-
derstand their roles as enemies, the evolution of their
diverse attack strategies, and the causes of their rapid
evolutionary diversiﬁcation. With the aid of a net-
work of collaborators, relationships of world Tachinidae
(200+ genera, 50+ tribes, all four subfamilies) will be
inferred using 8-10 genes and a large (150+) array of
morphological characters. RNAseq methods will per-
mit new markers to be developed, establish robust basal
relationships, and provide a foundation for future ge-
nomic research on the family. We will provide an un-
precedented, broad scale phylogeny of Tachinidae with
which we can revise existing classiﬁcations and analyze
the evolution of key

evolutionary sequence or NGS analysis. It is expected
that these would include phylogenetic methodology and
biological applications. The position permits freedom
for the postholder to be involved in research projects
already under way in the group (for example, detection
of adaptive evolution, analysis of patterns of DNA mu-
tations and amino acid replacements, sequence align-
ment, comparative analysis of genome-scale sequences,
methods to exploit NGS data) and to develop his/her
own interests in related areas; the Research Associate
will be expected to do both of these things.
In addition to pursuing their research projects, a suit-
ably experienced Research Associate will take responsi-
bility for various tasks maintaining and developing the
eﬃcient operation of the group. These may include
management and/or leadership of research projects of
their own and the group leader’s devising; prepara-
tion of grant applications, liaison with colleagues and
collaborators both within and outside of EMBL; pro-
motion of the group’s work at EBI and elsewhere (in-
cluding abroad); teaching at training events (including
abroad); compilation of materials for reports and pre-
sentations; scientiﬁc supervision of other staﬀ (includ-
ing post-graduate students and junior visitors).
The EBI is part of the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory (EMBL) and is Europe’s leading provider
of information services to biological researchers in
academia and industry.

experience in related ﬁelds will be advantageous. Neces-
sary qualiﬁcations include: understanding of and enthu-
siasm for the questions molecular biologists need to ask
of sequence data, experience of mathematical modelling
and statistical data analysis, and scientiﬁc computer
programming. A background in biology, mathemat-
ics/statistics, computer science or other technical disci-
plines, combined with subsequent cross-disciplinary ex-
perience, is the likely career path. Demonstrated previ-
ous success in the additional responsibilities described
above, and aptitude for all of them, will be preferred.

DukeU FieldAssist RockiesHerb
Field research opportunity in the northern Rockies
The Mitchell-Olds lab at Duke University seeks a highly
motivated, detail-oriented assistant for summer ﬁeld
research in the northern Rocky Mountains. We are
studying Boechera, a perennial herb that oﬀers genetic
tractability and ecological context. Current ﬁeld exper-
iments focus on questions related to local adaptation,
speciation, plant defense, and breeding systems.
Our research sites are located in east-central Idaho and
southwest Montana. Base camp is located near the
beautiful town of Salmon, but travel distances between
sites often necessitate overnight camping. Weather con-
ditions in the Rockies can be severe, and assistants
should expect to work in snow and rain as well as 90 de-
gree temperatures. Regular trips are made to Missoula,
Montana for groceries, supplies, and taco consumption.Applicants must be available throughout the ﬁeld sea-
son from early May or early June through mid-August,
but exact start and end dates are ﬂexible. However,
ability to start May 1st is a plus. Successful applicants
are expected to assist in data collection and data entry,
plant care, transplanting, seed collection, and driving
research vehicles. The work can be physically demand-
ing, and the research team usually collects data 5-6
days per week. Qualiﬁcations: 1) some undergraduate
education in biology, ecology, or related ﬁeld, or equiv-
alent experience; 2) experience camping and working
outdoors and/or previous ﬁeld research experience; 3)
ability to perform repetitive tasks with a cheerful atti-
tude and with attention to detail; 4) willingness to live

France DeepSeaMicrobeEvolution
An international chair position is open in the labora-
tory of Microbiology of Extreme Environments (LM2E)
(http://www.ifremer.fr/umr6197/ ). The LM2E ex-
plore the microbial diversity of marine extreme envi-
ronments such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and
deep-sea subterranean environments. These environ-
ments are important to understand the biological pro-
cesses and to decipher key evolutionary boundary con-
ditions of life, life origin and diversiﬁcation. These
deep-sea environments are governed by a set of physico-
chemical constraints and various environmental proper-
ties that make them all diﬀerent. Nevertheless, micro-
bial communities and animals thriving in these ecosys-
tems share many similarities suggesting that these
ecosystems might be connected. The extent and im-
portance of deep-sea environments only begin to be es-March 1, 2012 EvolDir 51
timated, while the deep geographical limits under the
sub seaﬂoor are not yet established. Based on previous
experience and expertise in these unique and extreme
ecosystems the LM2E holds a key position to clarify
a number of important issues ranging from molecular
adaptation to physiology and ecology of these extreme
ecosystems.
The LM2E conducts its investigations from the molec-
ular to ecosystem scale and two research topics, cor-
responding to two complementary levels of study have
been selected: study the diversity and function of deep-
sea extreme ecosystems and analysis of speciﬁc “adap-
tive” mechanisms based on some model organisms. The
ﬁrst theme involves projects that focus on the explo-
ration and characterization of microbial diversity of
Bacteria, Archaea and mobile genetic elements, as well
as functional approaches to contribute to a better un-
derstanding of the role of these micro-organisms in their
ecosystem and their interaction with their biological
and mineral environment. The second theme will an-
alyze some fundamental adaptive processes, particu-
larly those involved in the maintenance and stability
of genomes and those involved in adaptation to high
hydrostatic pressures of some model organisms belong-
ing in particular to the family Thermococcales.
The Chair will be hosted by the European Institute of
Marine studies ±, Institut Universitaire Europen de la
Mer, IUEM (UBO, CNRS, IRD). The candidate, cho-
sen jointly by the universities and by CNRS, by joint
selection panels, will be recruited by the universities as
Associate Professor and will be hosted also by CNRS.
This chair position will thus enable an assistant pro-
fessor to devote ﬁve years to a research project which
she/he will carry out within an appropriate scientiﬁc
environment. The LM2E would like to recruit a can-
didate who has skills in Genomics and Systems Biol-
ogy and who will interacts with scientists of the LM2E
working on the biology of extremophiles (ecology, bio-
diversity, microbial physiology, ecophysiology, biochem-
istry and molecular biology). The candidate will also
strengthen the research activity and the involvement of
the LM2E in the Axis 3 (Geobiological interactions in
extreme environments) of the LabexMer.
The LM2E looks for a young or tenured researcher with
a internationally recognized experience in the ﬁeld of
environmental genomics and / or systems biology to ex-
ploit the ﬂood of information from molecular genomic
analysis and post-genomic and use tools and experi-
mental methodologies necessary for data mining while
integrating the diﬀerent levels of information to un-
derstand as a biological system, the functioning of ex-
tremophilic microbes and their interactions with biotic
and abiotic components of their environment. The can-didate will also develop its pedagogical skills through a
teaching schedule limited to a third of its time in ge-
nomics and bioinformatics disciplines. This permanent
position is not only open to young candidates for their
ﬁrst associate professor position, but also to tenured
professors asking to be transferred and to researchers
wishing to convert to teaching positions.
Application procedures are the same as for associate
professor positions, and therefore require that a can-
didate be qualiﬁed ±by the Higher Education board.
Applicants must hold a PhD diploma or equivalent ex-
perience in Bioinformatics and environmental genomics
with a high level of skills. At least 3 years of postdoc
experience in genomics and system biology is required.
Applicants must provide evidence of their experience in
managing a research group and be able to foster inter-
national collaborations.
Ability to work in English is essential and the inter-
national dimension of the successful candidate will be
critical. Experience in fundraising for research projects
will be an advantage. Administrative contact: Isabelle

Trondheim EvolutionaryBiology
Associate professor position
Norwegian University of Science and Technology
(NTNU)
Faculty of natural science and technology Department
of Biology
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY
The Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences
and Technology, at the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology (NTNU) announces a vacant position
as Associate Professor in Evolutionary Biology. The
Department has at present 24 professors, 9 associate
professors, 3 adjunct professors and approximately 60
research fellows.
The main focus for the strategy of the Department of
Biology is to understand biological processes of life to
preserve the environment. The Department has an in-
terdisciplinary approach to education and research that
is deeply rooted in environmental biology, with evolu-
tionary biology as an important link between the diﬀer-
ent sub-disciplines. The Department currently consists
of seven research groups: behavior, evolution, evolution
and life history; conservation biology; plant ecology and
physiology; zoophysiology; molecular and systems biol-
ogy; environmental toxicology, and marine biology and
aquaculture. The Department is organized in three aca-
demic sections: Physiology, Environmental toxicology
and Biotechnology (PEB), Ecology, Ethology and Evo-
lution (EEE) and Marine Sciences (MS). The current
position will be organized under the EEE section.
Evolution and ecology are strong research-disciplines in
several of the research groups at the department. Un-
derstanding adaptations evolved through natural selec-
tion is key to understand evolution. Furthermore, the
use of evolutionary principles in preserving biodiversity
is pivotal for sustainable resource use in a changing
world. These evolutionary problems form an impor-
tant research area in several prominent groups at thedepartment, including the Centre for Conservation Bi-
ology, which is an interdisciplinary centre for research
into dynamical changes in biological diversity at diﬀer-
ent organismic levels. Evolutionary biology is therefore
one of the core subjects at the Department of Biology
and NTNU. The announced position should strengthen
the link between evolutionary and conservation biology.
The Department focuses on developing integrated re-
search groups where researchers within related ﬁelds
can establish strong research and teaching units within
evolution and ecology, but also in interaction with the
other sections. It is required that the new faculty mem-
ber has a strong research proﬁle that will strengthen
the current academic staﬀs from the EEE section, and
the Department as a whole. The new faculty member
should contribute in strengthening the research in evo-
lutionary biology at the Department. The appointed
person is expected to take active part in the further
development of evolutionary biology at NTNU.
The applicants should hold a PhD and document a
strong theoretical and/or empirical research compe-
tence in evolutionary biology. The potential of the can-
didate to co-operate within the existing research groups
is emphasized. Strong emphasis will be placed on the
ability of the candidates to initiate research and tutorial
agendas related to evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion biology.
The new faculty member will have responsibility for
part of the teaching in Evolutionary Biology and teach-
ing competence in this ﬁeld is therefore required. The
teaching will be at graduate, post-graduate and PhD
levels, including supervision of MSc and PhD fellows.
Emphasis will be placed on teaching and communica-
tion skills. Evaluation of the applicant will be based on
documented material, including pedagogical training,
presentation of academic work, experience from super-
vision and teaching of master-level candidates and PhD
candidates, as well as other related skills. Quality and
scope will be evaluated.
Academic staﬀ that is unable to document formal ped-
agogical qualiﬁcations in university-level teaching is
required to successfully complete a recognized course
that gives a pedagogical qualiﬁcation in university-level
teaching within two years of taking up the appointment.
Courses are available at the University.
Applicants short-listed for the position will be invited
for interview. A demonstration of teaching ability, usu-
ally in the form of a trial lecture, is also required.
The Associate Professor will be jointly responsible for
the development of the discipline together with other
scientiﬁc staﬀ in the department and will also partici-58 EvolDir March 1, 2012
pate in teaching activities, in accordance with the rele-
vant curriculum, and assist in developing the teaching
program, including advanced and postgraduate courses.
The Associate Professor will also be required to partic-
ipate in administrative work.
The Associate Professor is required to comply with reg-
ulations concerning developments within the discipline
and organisational changes at the University.

and Environment (INEE) and the University of Rennes
1. ECOBIO is a multidisciplinary unit working in the
ﬁeld of continental Ecology, that brings together fun-
damental concepts and skills in evolutionary biology,
community ecology and functional ecology. Its core
research is the understanding of ecosystem function-
ing through the analysis of biodiversity dynamics, from
genes to landscapes, and thus oﬀers wide opportunities
for developing integrative ecology. ECOBIO is also a
member part of the OSUR /lessmuchObservatoire des Sciences
de l’Univers /greatermuchwithin the University, that allow future
applicants excellent opportunities for cross-disciplinary
research collaboration in Earth and Environmental Sci-
ences.
Job Description Research : Within the University of
Rennes 1, and connecting with the OSUR , we seek
senior ecologists whose research interests focus on con-
tinental ecosystems and whose research is integrative
across areas of ecology to bridge evolutionary and func-
tional aspects of ecosystem ecology. Applications will
be particularly welcome from candidates who work on
aspects of global change and biodiversity, and aim at
explaining how phenotypic plasticity and adaptations,
including behavioural and ecophysiological ones, deter-
mine the ability of species to respond to global changes.
Research interests to investigate the paradox between
the speed at which global changes occurs and the slow-
ness of the implementation of the evolutionary process
(microevolution, macroevolution) will be highly consid-
ered to complement current strengths in ECOBIO. The
research expertise of the applicants could thus include
invasive species, complex community interactions, niche
concept, life history traits, environmental changes (lan-
duse/landcover or climatic changes), and modeling or
other experimental and computational approaches of
integrative ecology.
Education: The position also involves teaching at the
undergraduate (BSc) and graduate (master) educa-
tional programs in the ﬁeld of ecology and evolutionarybiology. The successful candidate will primary teach
in the BSc program of “Biology of Organisms” and in
the Master research program “Functional, Behavioural
and Evolutionary Ecology”, on speciﬁc topics such as:
population dynamics, evolutionary biology, community
ecology, behavioural ecology, ecophysiology, as well as
the analytical tools of modern ecology. He/She is ex-
pected to take a leadership in these programs or others
related environmental masters within the OSUR, and
interacting with the “Life and Environmental Sciences”
teaching programs, to enhance a quantitative and the-
oretical training of students for basic and applied re-
search in Ecology.
Application details : The position will be opened on
September 2012. The application has to be submit be-
fore 27 March 2012 at the University of Rennes 1, 2 rue
du Thabor, 35042 Rennes cedex, France. Salary to be
negotiated following research experience. Experienced
researchers (senior level) >10 years of research are ex-
pected. For additional information on the position ,

Advice drosophila incubator
I am in the market to buy an incubator (temper-
ature and humidity-controlled) for use in culturing
Drosophila melanogaster. However I’m not sure which
brand and model is best value for money, so I’m hoping
that the EvolDir community can give me some advice.
I am based in southern Sweden, so fairly large varia-
tion in external humidity levels can be expected. All I
know is that a colleague of mine has had a bad expe-

GroundSquirrel
Field Assistants Required-Columbian ground squirrels
Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada
We are looking for 4-5 volunteers to assist with ﬁeld-
work for the period of April 15 to Aug 31, 2012.
The project investigates the evolutionary ecology of
Columbian ground squirrels. As a member of the study,
assistants will be involved with monitoring the phenol-
ogy (when animals emerge from hibernation), reproduc-
tion and survival of individuals. Fieldwork will involve
live-trapping and handling of animals, behavioural ob-
servation, radio-telemetry (to locate natal burrows)
and assistance with the measurement of physiological
(metabolism) traits on free-ranging animals. This is an
excellent opportunity to gain experience working with
a collaborative research team on a long-term study of a
wild mammal. Opportunities exist for side-projects for
interested and motivated applicants.
All ﬁeldwork is carried out in the spectacular Rocky
Mountains of southwestern Alberta, Canada, home to
some of the most majestic wildlife in North Amer-
ica. We will be staying at the University of Calgary’s
R.B. Miller research station in Sheep River Provin-
cial Park, Alberta ( http://bgs.ucalgary.ca/facilities/-
facilities ). You will interact with other researchers68 EvolDir March 1, 2012
working with ground squirrels on a diversity of projects
in behavioural and population ecology. Additionally,
the ﬁeld station is home to a number of other re-
searchers working on a variety of projects, ranging from
insects to large mammals. Food and accommodation
are provided, but you will be required to make your own
way to either Calgary or Edmonton. Training will be
provided and no experience is necessary, but candidates
should have an interest in a number of the following
(the more the better!): ecology, evolutionary biology,
wildlife, ﬁeld biology, and animal behaviour. Periods
of time will be spent camping and, as such, successful
applicants need to enjoy the outdoors, be up-beat, pos-
itive, responsible and work well as a member of a team.
If you wish to apply for one of these posts then please
send a CV with a cover letter and contact details of
three references (with e-mail address), by email to Jeﬀ
Lane (contact info below), by March 08, 2012.

American science writing
From Anthem Press http://www.anthempress.com/-
index.php/an-anthology-of-nineteenth-century-
american-science-writing.html American Science
in the 19th century lagged behind Europe but was
certainly not without it luminaries and its lasting
contributions, especially in the Natural Sciences.
These luminaries included systematists and organismal
biologists who helped lay the foundation for the devel-
opment of modern evolutionary biology, names such
as Say, Nuttall, Raﬁnesque, Ord, Gray, Leidy, Dana,
Marsh, Wright, Cope, King, Merriam, and Agassiz.
Have you wondered about who these people really
were and their place in American Science? Have you
ever had the opportunity to read their original works?
Then perhaps this work should be on your bookshelf.

About This Book
This volume is a brief anthology of the most inﬂuen-tial writing by American scientists between 1800 and
1900. Arranged thematically and chronologically to
highlight the progression of American science through-
out the nineteenth century V from its beginnings in
self-taught classiﬁcation and exploration to the move-
ment towards university education and specialization V
it is the ﬁrst collection of its kind. Each section begins
with a biography, putting human faces to each time pe-
riod, and introducing such notable ﬁgures as Thomas
Jeﬀerson and Louis Agassiz.
valuable collection of original source documents on the
natural and physical sciences not readily available to
scholars and the general public. This anthology ex-
pands our understanding of the American contribu-
tion to nineteenth-century science, which is often over-
shadowed by European achievements. XAlan S. Weber,
Premedical Program, Weill Cornell Medical College in

work reﬂects a thorough reading of the major sources
in the history of science in America. Its preface and
introductions present a well-digested summary survey
of scientiﬁc activity in the United States, and nothing
comparable to this collection of primary sources exists.
Its focus on the scientists own words brings to life the
theories, methods, and questions that animated both

Bayesian ClusteringMethods
Dear Group,
I would like to ﬁnd a Baysian clustering method useful
to assign a posterior probability of group membership
into k groups for all individuals in my dataset. See data
description below. Your suggestions are much appreci-
ated. I am using R for all my statistical analysis.
Many Cheers, Keith
Data description:
I have sampled almost 2000 individual birds (sin-
gle species representing two subspecies or phenotypes)
across Sweden. All individuals are adult males. Al-
though this is one species, in middle of Sweden there
is a (migratory) divide where the southern individuals
presumably migrate to West Africa and north of the
divide they presumably migrate to East Africa. There
is a zone of overlap approximately 300 km wide over-
lapping the migratory divide.

(few specimens) of corbiculate bees: Apini (diﬀerent of
A.mellifera), Bombini, Meliponini and Euglossini. Ide-
ally specimens would be send in RNA-later solution or
frozen. Samples in Ethanol 75% or above are however
welcome too.
Please make contact in order to get the address for ex-
pidition.
Thanks for collaboration, Seb

DIY ABC70 EvolDir March 1, 2012
I am attempting to test divergence scenarios using DIY
ABC on three clusters of plant populations, each of
which may represent a distinct species (and thus may
not share immediate common ancestry). My data set
consists of 31 SSRs. No matter how I change scenario
parameters or adjust priors, DIY ABC ﬁnds that gene
genealogies do not support the scenarios. The program
has no problem dealing with each of the three popula-
tion clusters separately. My question is: at what point
should one conclude that the failure of the program to
accept the overall scenarios is due to the biological re-
ality that the three population clusters represent three
independent genealogies and thus violate the expecta-
tions of coalescence, rather than some ﬂaw in my sce-
nario priors. I realize this is a rather open-ended ques-
tion. I should add that with genetic distance clustering,
there is no bootstrap support for any “sister” relation-
ship between the three populations clusters. STRUC-
TURE, using the Evanno et al. delta K methods of
determining optimal K, also support the uniqueness of
each cluster. Am I just stubbornly refusing to face re-
ality?

EDEN undergrad internship
Undergraduate Training Opportunities in Emerging
Model Organisms
Are you an undergraduate student interested in gain-
ing research experience? Would you like to ﬁnd out
what it is like to work in a lab-based or ﬁeld-based
research environment? Are you interested in what hap-
pens when you combine evolution with development,
ecology with genetics, or lab work and ﬁeld work? Are
you unsure how to ﬁnd opportunities like this? If
you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then
EDEN’s Undergraduate Internship Program is for you!
You may have heard of fruit ﬂy genetics, forest ecol-
ogy, or biomedical research using mice as model organ-
isms. But did you know that there are labs studying
the evolution and function of butterﬂy wing patterns,
the genetic basis of diﬀerent ﬂowers shapes and col-ors, and African ﬁsh behavior and how it relates to
genome structure? The growing ﬁelds of evolutionary
ecological and developmental biology, often known as
Evo-Devo-Eco, use both classical and cutting-edge tech-
niques to study less traditional organisms, including
sponges, ﬁnches, columbines, dung beetles, lizards and
snails! The EDEN Undergraduate Training Program
can give you the opportunity for a summer research
internship in a lab studying such a new or emerging
model organism.
Goals of the Program
EDEN aims to train undergraduates in the ﬁeld of Evo-
Devo-Eco, with an emphasis on emerging model sys-
tems. Much undergraduate training in biology is based
on textbooks that emphasize the contributions of tra-
ditional model organisms to our understanding of the
natural world. Given the crucial role of such models in
the history and progress of science, this focus is both
inevitable and important. However, it is equally im-
portant that the next generation of scientists be made
aware of the increasing contributions of models that
emerge at the frontiers of the dynamic ﬁelds encom-
passed by Evo-Devo-Eco. EDEN oﬀers you the oppor-
tunity to do research in laboratories working on such
models, giving you the option to broaden the scope of
your future research choices. EDEN’s ultimate goal
with this program is to enable eﬀective and interdis-
ciplinary training of budding scientists in performing
research on emerging model systems.
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible students should be undergraduates at any U.
S. institution, including liberal arts colleges, commu-
nity colleges, and universities. Eligible host labs should
be conducting research using new and emerging model
organisms. If the proposed host lab is working on a
well-established model organism, your application must
explain how the techniques or skills that you learn in
the host lab will be applied to work on new or emerging
model organisms at your home institution.
Students may apply to work in a lab that is at their
home institution, as long as the proposed reserach in-
volves new and emerging model organisms. However, in
cases where all other aspects of applications are consid-
ered to be equally competitive, preference will be given
to applicants who propose to travel to a lab that is not
at their home institution.
We strongly encourage you to contact EDEN ( ad-
min@edenrcn.com) to conﬁrm that your proposal and
proposed host lab meet these criteria.
Host labs can be at any US institution, including lib-
eral arts colleges, universities, and research institutes,March 1, 2012 EvolDir 71
as long as the host lab has the necessary infrastruc-
ture to support the proposed project. Host labs can
be chosen from the list of participating labs <http:/-
/edenrcn.com/participating/ >, or students can make
their own arrangements with prospective labs. For as-
sistance in ﬁnding a suitable lab, click here <http://-
edenrcn.com/lab/ >. EDEN is committed to support-
ing all undergraduate students for this training pro-
gram, including students from groups that are tradi-
tionally underrepresented in the sciences, and students
from low-income backgrounds.
It is NOT a requirement that applicants for EDEN
funding, or hosts of EDEN-funded students, be listed
as EDEN Participating Labs <http://edenrcn.com/-
participating/ >. If you are applying for an EDEN un-
dergraduate internship, you can propose to work with
any lab in the US. However, please encourage your host
lab PI to add their details to the EDEN Participating
Labs<http://edenrcn.com/participating/ >database
by completing this brief survey <http://edenrcn.com/-
join/>.
Terms and Conditions
Each year, EDEN will award eight ten-week undergrad-
uate research internships. Each award consists of a
$4000 stipend per student, and need-based travel as-
sistance of up to $1000 per student. Exact amounts of
travel allowances will be determined on a case by case
basis. Students

and the Global Population Dynamics Database of long-
term abundance records. These data may be queried
by biological name, tree topology, data set attributes,
geography and time to answer complex questions that
span multiple data sets such as;
Which nocturnal South American mammals are de-
scended from the last common ancestor of thesespecies?
What are the ranges of Rodentia species that have a
body mass less than than 250g and for which there are
population abundance records between 1980-90?

EOL Phylogenetic Tree Challenge
We are pleased to announce the EOL Phylogenetic
Tree Challenge http://www.eol.org/info/tree challenge
. Encyclopedia of Life ( http://www.eol.org ) wishes
to give its users phylogenetically-informed ways to
browse and retrieve information from its pages. A
prize (sponsored travel to the iEvoBio 2012 meeting
http://www.ievobio.org ) is oﬀered to the individual or
team that can provide a very large, phylogenetically-
organized set(s) of scientiﬁc names suitable for inges-
tion into the Encyclopedia of Life as an alternate brows-
ing hierarchy.
This challenge has two core purposes:
– It provides a testbed for the Evolutionary Informatics
community to develop robust methods for producing,
serving, and evaluating large, biologically meaningful
trees that will be useful both to the research commu-
nity and to broader audiences.
– It enables the Encyclopedia of Life to organize the
information it aggregates according to phylogenetic re-
lationships; in other words, it provides a direct pipeline
from research results to practical use.
A second iEvoBio attendance prize is oﬀered by the
Global Names project ( http://www.globalnames.org ).
The submission period is expected to begin 20 Febru-
ary. Final submissions are due by 15 April 2012. Sub-
mission instructions and detailed information about
the challenge and eligibility are available at http://-
www.eol.org/info/tree challenge . To ask questions or
discuss this challenge, please join the Phylogenetic Tree72 EvolDir March 1, 2012

Field Museum Chicago Summer
Undergrad REU
Field Museum summer 2012 undergraduate research in-
ternship opportunities
The Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois is please to
announce its 2012 summer REU internship program.
Please visit the web site: http://ﬁeldmuseum.org/-
about/research-experiences-undergraduates-reu for
program details and REU project descriptions.
All REU applications must be made online at:
http://ﬁeldmuseum.org/about/research-experiences-
undergraduates-reu Application deadline: March
15th, 2012.
Deadline for letters of reference: March 20th, 2012.
Announcement of Awards: April 15, 2012.
Start of 2012 REU program: Monday, June 4 or Mon-
day, June 11, 2012 (depending on the applicant’s school
schedule). The 4th Undergraduate Research Sympo-
sium will be held Saturday, August 11 at the Field Mu-
seum.
Please note: Undergraduate student participants in
REU Sites must be citizens or permanent residents of
the United States or its possessions and must be a fresh-
man, sophomore or junior at the time of application.
Seniors cannot apply for an REU internship.
The Field Museum houses one of the world’s foremost
scientiﬁc collections of biological diversity ( >25 mil-
lion specimens), and supports active biodiversity re-
search around the globe. Despite the urgency of the
current biodiversity crisis, few educational opportuni-
ties exist for students in the biological sciences to in-
teract with scientists and institutions dedicated to the
study of organic diversity. The Field Museum REU
program will train a cohort of at least eight students
in biodiversity-related research in a 10-week summer
program. Each participant will undertake an indepen-dent research project supervised by a museum scien-
tist in a discipline such as taxonomy and systematics,
phylo/biogeography, paleontology, molecular phyloge-
netics, or conservation. Students will experience bio-
logical diversity through the use of the museum’s col-
lections in their research, and will be trained in project-
relevant techniques and equipment such as the scanning
electron microscope, various light microscopy set-ups,
and equipment in the Pritzker DNA lab. A six-week
course in phylogenetic systematics is run concurrently
with intern projects and will provide a common the-
oretical framework for their research. REU students
will receive an introduction to the Encyclopedia of Life
(EOL) in Field Museum’s Biodiversity Synthesis Cen-
ter. At the conclusion of the summer students will
present their research results to their peers and museum
scientists at the Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Providing equal opportunity in biodiversity-related re-
search is an important goal of the program.
REU student participants receive a salary of $4,500 for
the 10-week program, and additionally $2,500 subsis-
tence and $500 travel allowance.
This REU program is funded through a REU-Site grant
from the National Science Foundation to Drs. Petra
Sierwald and Ken Angielczyk (Field Museum of Natu-
ral History).

IBS MacArthurWilsonAward
CallNominations
The International Biogeography Society announces The
MacArthur & Wilson Award
Named after R. H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson, this
award honors their seminal contributions to biogeogra-
phy. The award recognizes an individual for a notable,
innovative contribution to biogeography. It is targeted
at comparatively early career investigators and has a
guideline that recipients should have completed their
PhD no more than 12 years before the deadline for nom-
inations. The committee has some ﬂexibility in regard
to this criterion, to take account of diﬀering life and ca-
reer paths. A pair of collaborators might be considered
providing both are eligible by this criterion.
The recipient should be prepared to oﬀer a paper at
the biennial meeting of the IBS and will be invited to
publish a short article on their work in Frontiers of Bio-geography. In return, their attendance at the meeting
will be underwritten by the IBS.
Nominations consist of a supporting cover letter of no
more than 800 words, co-signed by two members of the
IBS, plus a short cv of the nominee, plus pdfs of four
key papers published by the nominee, at least two of
which should have been published within the last three
years. Current members of the IBS Board are not eli-
gible for nomination.
Inaugural competition: The ﬁrst award will be
presented at the IBS biennial meeting in Miami,
Florida, 10-12 January 2013. Nominations should
be sent to the Chair of the MacArthur & Wil-
son Award Sub-Committee (pdf’s are preferred;
Robert.whittaker@ouce.ox.ac.uk) no later than Friday
23rd March, 2012. An individual can be nominated for
a single paper or a ’group of papers’ and it is antici-
pated that such a corpus of work will involve - in the
spirit of MacArthur & Wilson’s famous monograph -
scholarly collaborations with other co-workers.
The oﬃcial announcement can be found in the
current issue of Frontiers of Biogeography, the
scientiﬁc journal of the International Biogeogra-
phy Society ( http://www.biogeography.org/html/fb/-

IonTorrentReviews answers
Recently I posted a message asking for feedback from
users of the Ion Torrent and how it compares to the
Illumina MiSeq.I received many responses from others
interested in the answer to this question, but unfortu-
nately I did not receive any replies from anyone actually
using this equipment. I did however receive some links
to other sites with pertinent information and a very in-
formative comparison of these two platforms.These are
listed below.I would still appreciate any additional in-
formation on this topic.

And then here is a recent anouncement from Life Tech-
nologies about a
new small sequencer:
http://goo.gl/9X8lc 2.) Here is a very helpful blog
with information about many NGS platforms:
http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/ I also contacted Dr.
Keith Robison - the author of this blog - and asked him
speciﬁcally to compare the Ion Torrent and the Illumina
MiSeq.His response is pasted below.
Just as a reminder – I haven’t had hands on either ma-
chine (I have yet to see a MiSeq up close) but I have had
data generated for me on both systems & have tried to
seriously envision what each system would be like to
have in a lab at my employer in terms of cost & labor.
Some key points to consider:
Both machines have a sequence output well suited for
amplicon sequencing and for small genome sequencing
(probably up through a few tens of megabases). Neither
is well suited for really large genomes, metagenomes, for
transcriptomes or for counting applications (e.g. ChIP-
Seq) – the numbers of reads and amount of data are re-
ally too small and the cost per basepair is much higher
than a system like HiSeq.
From a user’s perspective, the main two reasons to go
with these systems rather than HiSeq/GAIIx is the low
cost per experiment and rapid turnaround time.
MiSeq has a greater range of software on the aca-
demic/freeware side; Ion doesn’t really seem to have
caught the bioinformatic developer community’s imag-
inaition. Some software developed for 454 should work
with Ion Torrent data, due to each having similar er-
ror proﬁles (homopolymer runs); this error proﬁle also
frustrates some software designed for Illumina. On the
other hand, a lot of tool are platform-agnostic. On the
commercial side, there does seem to be healthy support
for all platforms.
Contrasting the two systems further are the read pro-
ﬁles. MiSeq oﬀers a number of read lengths up to 150x2
paired end (which is longer than HiSeq and perhaps one
reason why MiSeq may have an edge over HiSeq for
genome assembly). Ion now has ~250bp reads (you get
a distribution) and a paired end protocol, though not a
lot of groups are using it & I haven’t seen 250x2 paired
end data yet (which would be very cool to have!).Both are probably going to have further read length im-
provements. I’m guessing the next Ion mark will be in
the 300-350 range and probably be released sometime
this spring. Several groups have demonstrated greater
than 150 bp runs on the MiSeq, and Illumina will be
releasing longer kits this summer (I think 250x2 is the
ﬁrst one).
Overall, I think the true end-to-end run times are get-
ting very similar, but Ion may still be a bit better –
if you are willing to put in the extra labor. Also, in
planning throughput the timings can be troublesome.
For example, right now the 150x2 mode takes 27 hours,
which means if you were running just that & didn’t
have shifts 24x7, it is hard to keep the machine crank-
ing all week (Illumina is ﬁnding clever ways to shorten
cycle time; I think their reps told me the 250x2 will take
/less/ time than that, though I could be remembering
that wrong.).
it does appear that the 318 chip is the end of the PGM
line, though LIFE has not made that explicit – Proton
will be the instrument for doing big sequencing. MiSeq
will get an upgrade this summer to allow reading both
surfaces of the ﬂowcell; this will roughly double the
amount of data. Both will probably top out at a size
suitable for targeted sequencing in model systems or
with very focused exome arrays (but not whole exome).

Low MrBayes PP values
I have a data set for which MrBayes yields a poorly
resolved tree with (mostly) low PP values, in contrast
with the MP tree in which bootstrap values are quite
high. For all data sets I’ve ever analyzed, the Bayesian
trees have always surpassed parsimony trees in resolu-
tion, which seems to be the case for most researchers.
Thoughts, suggestions for this odd result are welcome.

microMORPH PlantEvol
TrainingGrants
microMORPH is pleased to announce a funding oppor-
tunity for undergraduates ($5,000), graduates students,
postdoctorals, and assistant professors ($3,500) in plant
development or plant evolution. These grants are avail-
able to support cross-disciplinary visits between labs or
institutions for a period of a few weeks to an entire
semester. We are particularly interested in proposals
that will add a developmental perspective to a study of
evolution of populations or closely related species. We
are also interested in developmental studies that will in-
corporate the evolution of populations orclosely related
species. The deadline for proposals is March 9th, 2012.
More information about the training grants and the ap-
plication process may be found on the microMORPH
website:

NESCent Phylotastic hackathon
Jun4-8
Dear colleagues
Every year, the number and size of available species
phylogenies grows, with the largest trees now exceeding
10^5 tips. The information contained in these mega-
trees is tremendous, but there is no easy way to access
and use it.
To address this issue, a NESCent working group, named
HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies), has
planned a hackathon ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-
Hackathon ) in which scientist-programmers will design
and implement Phylotastic!, an open software system
to extract a phylogeny for a named set of species from
available megatrees, and optionally create mash-ups
with data from online services. Phylotastic is envi-
sioned as a set of web services that collectively provides
the operations? pruning, grafting, name-reconciliation,
branch estimation, translation? that will democratize
using the Tree of Life, making it accessible and com-
putable for researchers throughout the life sciences,
from community ecology to comparative genomics
Applications are now being accepted to participate in
the Phylotastic hackathon, which will take place June
4 to 8 at NESCent headquarters in Durham, NC (see
below, How to Apply). Support for travel and meal
expenses will be available to each successful applicant,
according to his or her stated needs.
We urge you to apply if you are enthusiastic about the
goals of the project, and you have one or more of the
following skills:
development, adaptation and use of software for mega-
tree informatics, grafting & pruning trees, branch
length estimation, NeXML support, provenance an-
notation, mashups (semantic integration), taxonomic
name resolution, phylogenetic visualization, construc-
tion of and programming with web service interfaces,
and assembling web-services into executable workﬂows
.
We also welcome your application if you can envision
a role for yourself based on other attributes not listed,including non-programming skills (e.g., generating doc-
umentation) and expert knowledge of use-cases (i.e.,
real-world problems).

Volunteer Field Assistant Required Social Behaviour in
Tropical Paper Wasps Mid April - Late June 2012
A volunteer ﬁeld assistant is required to help with a
ﬁeld-based project on social behaviour in social wasps.
The position is a fantastic opportunity to gain tropical
ﬁeld experience working in a vibrant research group,
from the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of Lon-
don ( www.zsl.org/seiriansumner ). The project is con-
cerned with the evolution of castes (queens and work-
ers) in Polistes paper wasps. These are a well-studied
genus of social insects representing the early stages of
social evolution where castes lack morphological dif-
ferences, but have clear behavioural roles. Our study
species is the tropical Polistes canadensis, found in Cen-
tral and South America. It builds small nests (c20-60
females) that lack an envelope, so individually marked
wasps can be easily observed and castes can be manipu-
lated. The 2012 ﬁeld site is based near the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Station at Galatea, Colon, Republic
of Panama and the ﬁeld season will run from mid April
until end of June.
The work involves marking wasps, conducting censuses
and behavioural observations and simple manipulation
experiments. Assistants are generally expected to be
graduates with a good degree in the biological sciences,
background in and keen interest in behavioural ecol-
ogy and/or social evolution. ˆA Experience gained on the
project will be especially useful for those soon to com-
mence a ﬁeld-based MSc or PhD project. ˆA Applicants
should be ﬁt, enthusiastic, hard working, and happy
with living shared accommodation and working in un-
comfortable conditions. Previous experience of working
on social insects and/or in the tropics would be an ad-
vantage. A clean driving license and some basic knowl-
edge of Spanish is also desirable. The applicant should
be comfortable and must be able to commit to the full
ﬁeld season. NB these wasps do sting if provoked!
All work-related costs in Panama will be paid, includ-
ing accommodation. In addition the assistant will re-
ceive a minimum of ˆA£500 towards travel costs (e.g.
air ticket). More details are available from Dr Seirian
Sumner (Seirian.Sumner@ioz.ac.uk) and/or Dr Solenn
Patalano (solenn.patalano@babraham.ac.uk). Applica-
tions should include CV (with email addresses for two
referees) and a covering letter explaining why you wouldMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 81
like to work on the Project. Applications should be sub-
mitted by e-mail to both Drs Sumner & Patalano by
Thursday 24th February 2012. Shortlisted applicants
will be notiﬁed by email by March 1st, and will be in-
vited for interview either in person or over skype/phone

Next up at http://phyloseminar.org/: “RevBayes: An
R like Environment for Bayesian phylogenetic infer-
ence” John P. Huelsenbeck and Sebastian H¨ ohna (UC
Berkeley and Stockholm University)
RevBayes is a computer program that uses directed
acyclic graphs (DAG’s) to specify any type of model,
to hold the model and data in memory, and to compute
the likelihood of the parameters of the model. DAG’s
provide a framework for the construction of modular
models. Models can easily be extended and/or parts
of the model exchanged (e.g., the substitution process
and clock model) and several models can be combined.
The design of RevBayes should allow the implementa-
tion of any extension to existing models. RevBayes is
mainly developed for Bayesian phylogenetic analyses,
but it can be extended to any inference on probabilistic
models.
In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to the con-
cept of DAG’s and how they are used to construct a
model. Once the model is speciﬁed, I will show how to
simulate new observations under the model and how to
estimate its parameters. I will demonstrate this in the
RevLanguage, which is an R-like language for building
DAG’s for phylogenetic problems. The RevLanguage is
used interactively to specify the model, as done with R.
I will show how a full phylogenetic model is speciﬁed,
step-by-step. I will mainly focus on various standard
substitution models, relaxed clock models, and diver-
gence times priors. Speciﬁcally, I will show a new birth-
death model with speciation and extinction rates vary-
ing over time and use this in a integrative analysis. In
the integrative analysis I condition only on the align-
ment (only the alignment is considered to be known)
and estimate the tree and divergence times simultane-
ously as well as the speciation and extinction rates.

Plant Evolutionary changes project
Project Baseline is a nationwide, long-term, NSF-
funded initiative designed to build a research-quality
seed bank that will enable contemporary and future sci-
entists to directly study evolutionary changes as plants
respond to environmental change. We will do this by
collecting and storing seeds from well-deﬁned popu-
lations of relatively common, widely-distributed, and
short-lived plant taxa. The seeds will be archived at
the National Center for Genetic Resources Preserva-
tion, in Fort Collins, CO. Seeds will be released to
researchers at deﬁned (e.g., 5-10 year) intervals over
a period of 50 years, to be grown in common gar-
dens with their descendants, or subjected to other,
more novel, types of phenotypic and genetic anal-
ysis. Because this project is designed to beneﬁt
the scientiﬁc community as a whole, we are solicit-
ing suggestions for candidate species. If you would
like to suggest a species or population, please ﬁll out
and submit the Species Suggestion Form at http://-
www.baselineseedbank.org/suggestionForm.html . The
main criteria for sites are that they be ensured of long-term protection from major disturbance and that they
be physically and legally accessible by collection teams.

Summer ﬁeld research internships
Are you interested in gaining ﬁeld research experience
and learning about the ecology and evolution of plants
and plant-animal interactions in fragmented prairie?
We are looking for 3-5 summer ﬁeld researchers for
an NSF-funded project on habitat fragmentation of the
tallgrass prairie. We are investigating how small plant
population size inﬂuences inbreeding, demography, pol-

nacea angustifolia. This is a great summer internship,
REU, or co-op for those interested in ﬁeld biology or
conservation research.
No experience is necessary, but you must be enthusi-
astic and hard-working. You will survey natural plant
populations, measure plant traits in experimental plots,
hand-pollinate plants, observe & collect insects, and as-
sist in all aspects of research. Housing is provided and
there is a stipend. Undergraduate students have the
opportunity to do an independent project as an REU
participant.

RADTAG sequencing facility
We areconducting a molecular biology project on two
roe deer species in order to ﬁnd species - speciﬁc nuclear
DNAmarkers and to assess the introgression level be-
tween these two closely relatedspecies. We plan to ob-
tain our goals using RAD TAG sequencing. We know,
thereis a very good lab in Edinburgh, Scotland and in
Oregon, USA (eg Genepool). However, Edinburg lab
seems to be very busy,and Oregon is relatively expen-
sive. Our project is now going and we havefunding for
it. Because our project ends in the end of this year we
search forany labs/companies to perform RAD TAG
sequencing during next six months. Wewould greatly
appreciate any advice concerning possibility of RAD
TAGsequencing or maybe to use other markers to as-
sess a level of genome introgression?with kind regards

SouthAfrica volunteers
SmallMammalEvolution
3 volunteers needed from July / August to November
/ December 2012
as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility
in the striped mouse. One focus this year is on person-84 EvolDir March 1, 2012
ality traits of striped mice. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers will participate in a project on
personality traits of striped mice, doing behavioral tests
at the research station and in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are
also expected to help with maintenance of the research
station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1250 (around 180 US$, 120 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
2500, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$, 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in
Germany, SSJARP in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
2-3 volunteers starting in July / August 2012. Volun-
teers are expected to stay at least three months, but
longer periods of up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and yourCV via email to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch.

SSB ErnstMayr Award
Society of Systematic Biologists Ernst Mayr AwardMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 85
(Graduate Student Award)
The Ernst Mayr Award is given to the presenter of the
outstanding student talk in the ﬁeld of systematics at
the annual meetings of the Society of Systematic Biolo-
gists (SSB). This is SSB’s premier award, and is judged
by the quality and creativity of the research completed
over the course of the student’s PhD program. The
award consists of $1000, a certiﬁcate of distinction, and
a two-year subscription to the journal Systematic Biol-
ogy.
Eligibility: Members of the Society who are advanced
PhD students or have completed their Ph.D. within the
last 15 months are eligible. Applicants may be from any
country, but must be members of SSB, and are advised
to join the Society as soon as possible to be considered
(to join go to: http://systbio.org/?q=node/6 ). Previ-
ous Mayr award winners are not eligible.
Application Procedure: 1. To be considered for
this award, you will need to submit a 400-word ab-
stract of your talk to the Evolution Ottawa meeting
website ( http://www.confersense.ca/Evolution2012/-
index.htm ) at the time of registration. Instructions for
registering as a potential Mayr award contender will
be given on the meeting website. 2. Abstracts should
clearly indicate methods used, conclusions, and the rel-
evance to systematics. Presentations focusing on other
areas of biology (ecology, behavior, genetics, popula-
tions or molecular biology, etc.) that lack a strong sys-
tematics emphasis are not eligible. 3. Applications for
this award will be accepted only until the end of early
registration (April 30, 2012). 4. At the closing of early
registration, a subset of applicants will be selected by
the SSB Awards Committee to present their talks in
the Mayr Symposium during the meeting. All appli-
cants will be notiﬁed about selection decisions by May
15.
Judging: Based on submitted abstracts, the Mayr
Awards Committee (appointed by the Awards Chair,
Sydney Cameron) will select a maximum of 16 appli-
cants for inclusion in the Mayr Award symposium.
The Mayr symposium will be held at a single venue as
a continuous session. Talks will be judged on creativ-
ity, depth and excellence of research, and on quality of
presentation. Competitive students are expected to be
in the ﬁnal stages of their doctoral program, presenting
results of a major body of work.
Co-Authors: The talk may be co-authored. It is under-
stood that the ideas, data and conclusions presented
are primarily and substantially the work of the student
presenter, and the intention is that the student presen-
ter will be senior author on the published version of thepaper.
Notiﬁcation of Winner: The winner of the award will be
announced at the SSB business meeting in Ottawa and
again during the banquet awards ceremony (compli-
mentary ticket provided) at the conclusion of the Evo-
lution Meetings, whereupon the winner will be given
an award certiﬁcate. An announcement of the win-
ner will be published in Systematic Biology and placed
on the SSB website (see last year’s winner at http://-
systbiol.org/ ).

SSB Mini-Arts grant
SSB: Mini-ARTS Grant
The Society of Systematic Biologists is pleased to an-
nounce the availability of awards for revisionary tax-
onomy and systematics, modeled after the NSF Dear
Colleague Letter: Advancing Revisionary Taxonomy
and Systematics (ARTS) recently developed within the
Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster. We are
calling these ’mini-ARTS’ grants. These awards are
designed to allow SSB members (students, post-docs,and faculty) to spend a summer or semester appren-
ticed to an expert in a particular taxonomic group or
to enhance revisionary taxonomic and systematics re-
search in novel ways. Goals of this award program are
to address constraints on our knowledge of undescribed
biodiversity, assist in passing on taxonomic expertise
before it is lost, increase the number of students with
broad training in organismal biology and systematics,
and support projects in biodiversity and taxonomy in-
formatics as well as monographic and revisionary tax-
onomy. Activities can include a trip to the taxonomist’s
laboratory, pay for the taxonomist to visit the appli-
cant’s laboratory for a period of time, or pay for costs
of computer time or development of interactive keys
for electronic dissemination of systematics results. Re-
quests for support may be in any amount up to $3,000.
We will fund two or three of these awards this year.
Please visit NSF’s website http://www.nsf.gov/-
pubs/2011/nsf11037/nsf11037.jsp for more information
about their ARTS program.
How to apply (deadline March 31, 2012) A complete ap-
plication includes 1) a brief description of the project,
including a separate section justifying the importance
of the taxon and the revisionary work, 2) an itemized
budget, 3) the applicant’s CV, and 4) a letter of sup-
port from the taxonomic expert or collaborator. If the
applicant is a student or post-doc, please also include
a reference letter from the advisor. Applicants may
be from any country, but must be members of SSB,
and are advised to join the Society as soon as possible
to facilitate their applications (to join go to: http://-
systbio.org/?q=node/6 ). The narrative part of the ap-
plication should be no more than two pages, including
the budget, but not including the curriculum vitae and
letter(s).
Grant applications should be sent to the SSB Awards
Committee ( ssb-apps@life.illinois.edu), Committee
Chair Sydney Cameron. E-mail submissions are re-
quired, and applicants should use pdf format for all
documents. In the subject line of the email, please in-
dicate the SSB award category as ’mini-ARTS’.

Visualising evolutionDear list members,
We (Miriam Quick: researcher for graphics, Stefanie
Posavec: graphic designer and I: evolutionary ecolo-
gist) have received an ESEB Outreach grant to do the
research for a graphic that illustrates how evolutionary
theories are themselves subject to change. Our aim is
to communicate the facts of evolution but also to excite
and inspire, using a compelling design that will attract
people not normally interested in science.
As we all know, evolution is a thriving research area and
we are aiming to do justice to the diversity of exciting
work going on today.
We want to hear from you!
- What do you identify as the major evolutionary re-
search areas right now? - What do you anticipate to be
the major research areas of the near future? - Where
do the next (potential) conﬂicts arise?
We really look forward to hearing your an-
swers to our questions (please email me:
tania.jenkins@iee.unibe.ch), and hope to incorpo-
rate some of them into our completed graphic!
Best wishes, Tania

Project Description:
Understanding the costs and beneﬁts of mutualism and
its persistence over time requires both an ecological an
geographical context. The goal of this NSF-supported
project is to understand how plant population size and
reproductive traits are inﬂuenced by environmental gra-
dients and how their variation inﬂuences local- and
geographical-scale dynamics in a pollination mutualism
subject to parasitism. Our research focuses on a ﬁg-ﬁg
wasp mutualism composed of Ficus petiolaris and its
species-speciﬁc ﬁg wasp pollinator. Characteristic of
ﬁg-ﬁg wasp interactions, this ﬁg species is completely
dependent on its ﬁg wasp for pollination while female
wasps oviposit in a subset of ﬁg ﬂowers and their oﬀ-
spring feed on developing ﬁg seeds. Associated with
this mutualism is a well-deﬁned community of parasitesMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 95
comprised of seed-eating ﬁg wasps that do not function
as pollinators, and a nematode parasite of the pollina-
tor. The geographical setting for this system, the Sonor
an Desert of Baja California, Mexico, represents the
latitudinal and environmental limits of the ﬁg-ﬁg wasp
mutualism in North America. Here, F. petiolaris popu-
lations are often small and spatially isolated and simu-
lation studies have shown that where ﬁg population size
is small, reliance on species-speciﬁc, short-lived pollina-
tors combined with the unusual, among-tree ﬂowering
asynchrony (but within-tree ﬂowering synchrony) typi-
cal of ﬁgs, leads to a high risk of local pollinator extinc-
tion and mutualism failure. Commonly cited, though
rarely tested, is the hypothesis that where host popula-
tions are small mutualism may be stabilized by repro-
ductive adjustments in the ﬁg; namely increased intra-
crown asynchrony in ﬂower and fruit production and
longer receptivity of individual ﬂowers to pollinators.
We suspect, however, that these reproductive adjust-
ments by the plant may prove costly by potentially ben-
eﬁting to parasites that negatively impact ﬁg seed and
pollin ator production. The patchy distribution of F.
petiolaris, its high within-crown ﬂowering asynchrony
(atypical of ﬁgs) and high parasite loads, as well as po-
tential interactions among these factors, make this an
interestingly complex yet well-deﬁned system for evalu-
ating these predictions and the impact of environmen-
tal and biotic stressors on the ﬁtness and persistence of
mutualism.
We will determine the relationship between ﬁg popula-
tion size and bio-climatic variables related to precipi-
tation and temperature, to test hypotheses concerning
the beneﬁts (to pollinators) and costs (of parasites) of
ﬁg reproductive trait variation as a function of popula-
tion size, and to quantify how these variables interact
to inﬂuence plant-pollinator-parasite interactions and
mutualism ﬁtness. This research includes a graphical
modeling component to infer conditional interactions
among species, and a simulation modeling

“Causes and consequences of variation in dispersal be-
haviour”
Organization
This research project is a collaborative eﬀort of the
research groups Theoretical Biology and Behavioural
Ecology and Self-organization (BESO), which both are
part of the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary
Studies at the University of Groningen (The Nether-
lands). The research is funded by a TopGrant (ALW-
TOP/11.017) allocated to Prof. Jan Komdeur from the
Netherlands Science Foundation (NWO).
Job description
In many organisms individuals diﬀer systematically in
their dispersal behaviour. Moreover, individual vari-
ation in dispersal is correlated with other traits, in-
cluding metabolism, activity, aggressiveness, boldness,
sociability, behavioural ﬂexibility and learning ability.
Although such correlation structures (“dispersal syn-
dromes”) have been described for many species, nei-
ther their evolutionary emergence nor their ecological,
evolutionary and genetic consequences are well under-
stood. By means of a theoretical approach (using an-
alytical models and individual-based computer simula-
tions) the project will address questions such as: Why
are the dispersal syndromes in diﬀerent species remark-
ably similar in some respects and remarkably diﬀerent
in others? What are the consequences of variation in
dispersal for social evolution (e.g., cooperative breed-
ing) and the mating system? What are the implications
of non-equilibrium dynamics for the genetic structure
of a population and for the estimation of pedigrees, re-
latedness and ﬁtness?
The project is designed as a 4-year PhD project; how-
ever, we also welcome applications from exceptional
post-doctoral researchers for a 3-year position. The
close collaboration between theoretical and behavioural
researchers, along with access to the long-term Sey-
chelles warbler dataset, provides a unique opportunity
to forge a link between conceptual models and real-
world data.
Qualiﬁcations
- MSc in Theoretical Biology, Behavioural Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology or related discipline (for a PhD
candidate) or a PhD in any of these disciplines (for a
postdoc).
- Research experience in areas related to model devel-
opment and analysis, individual-based simulations or
dynamical systems (desired for a PhD candidate; es-
sential for a postdoc).
- Working knowledge of programmes like C++,Maple/Mathematica/Matlab or R; excellent program-
ming skills (desired for a PhD candidate; essential for
a postdoc).
- Excellent academic record (as shown by a list of ex-
amination marks); proven ability to plan and prioritize
work and to work to and meet deadlines; strong com-
mitment to excellence in research and teaching.
- Ability to develop creative approaches to problem
solving; creativity, curiosity, and ambition; proactive
attitude; ability to implement new methods and ideas.
- Excellent organisational and interpersonal skills; abil-
ity to work in a team consisting of scientists, students
and technical assistants with diﬀerent backgrounds.
- Excellent communication skills: eﬀective paper writ-
ing skills (demonstrated by publications) and ample ex-
perience with delivering presentations.
- Good command of the English language (oral and
written).

UMontpellierII AntagonisticEvol
Postdoctoral Scientist to study Host-Pathogen Coevo-
lutionA two-year Postdoctoral Scientist position is available
starting October 1st, 2012 at the University of Mont-
pellier II, France. The work will be performed in the
research group headed by Dr. Michael Hochberg*, and
in association with Dr. Peter Thrall (CSIRO Can-
berra, Australia) and Prof. Jennifer Dunne (Santa
Fe Institute, USA). The project is fully funded by
a grant from the McDonnell Foundation ( http://-
www.jsmf.org/grants/2011013/ ).
Context: The proposed project will probe how envi-
ronments inﬂuence the structure of antagonistic coevo-
lutionary interactions. In nature individual organisms
are confronted with diverse arrays of abiotic and biotic
stresses and mortality factors. This generates higher
order complexity because of the multi-scale nature of
these interactions, and because both exogenous envi-
ronments and organisms shift and change in ways which
may be diﬃcult to predict. Our goal is to explain pat-
tern by manipulating this complexity at diﬀerent scales
and teasing apart the contributions of its components
to coevolutionary dynamics and structure.
Requirements: PhD and demonstrated experience in ei-
ther mathematical modelling or microbial experimental
evolution. Excellent command of scientiﬁc English.
Interested candidates should apply by 1 May 2012 by
sending (1) a letter of motivation, (2) a CV with pub-
lication list and (3) the names, institutions and email
addresses of three references to Dr. Michael Hochberg

UNotreDame MosquitoGenomics
POSTDOC: Functional Genomics of malaria
mosquitoes
An NIH-funded postdoctoral position is available im-
mediately in the lab of Nora Besansky, Department of
Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame. The
goal of the project is to uncover the genetic basis of a
physiological trait– saltwater tolerance– in an African
malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles merus. This pri-
marily coastal species is sister to An. gambiae, an
obligate freshwater breeder that is the main vector of
malaria across most of tropical Africa. The two mor-
phologically indistinguishable species are very closely
related, and can be crossed to produce viable and fer-
tile F1 females. Laboratory colonies of both species and
insectary rearing facilities are available at Notre Dame;
other tools include completely sequenced genomes (for
An. gambiae, since 2002; for An. merus, later this
year). Genetic analysis of saltwater tolerance will
involve two experimental approaches: QTL mapping
based on next generation sequencing, and comparative
transcriptomics based on RNASeq. As such, the project
will involve the collection and analysis of large next-
generation sequencing datasets. The successful candi-
date will work with Dr. Besansky in collaboration with
Dr. Romero-Severson at Notre Dame, and Dr. Peter
Andolfatto at Princeton. The Besansky lab has other
ecological and evolutionary genomics projects ongoing
in An. gambiae; for more information, please see:

Natural History Museum, University of Oslo Postdoc-
toral position 1: Evolutionary Biology (Intraspeciﬁc Di-
vergence)
The postdoc fellow will work on the project The early
stages of the speciation process - prezygotic reproduc-
tive isolation and diversiﬁcation in passerines, funded
by the Research Council of Norway and NHM. Speci-
ation is a fundamental evolutionary process in which
lineages diverge to form new species. Understanding
speciation processes is essential for understanding the
evolution of biodiversity. Sexual selection may play a
role in speciation processes, e.g. by promoting evolu-
tion of secondary sexual traits and preferences in al-
lopatry, leading to divergence and premating isolation
upon secondary contact. However, if sexual ornaments
do not diverge in allopatry, populations may evolve
deep genetic divergence but still despeciate upon sec-
ondary contact. The postdoctoral fellow will investi-
gate cases of deep sympatric intraspeciﬁc divergences in
two passerine species (common redstart and raven), us-
ing multilocus coalescence-based analyses, and explore
several hypotheses for how such deep divergences have
evolved. The project will require the use of a variety of
analytical tools, like modern molecular genetic analy-
ses, population genetics and coalescence analyses, and
comparative statistics. The project will include com-
prehensive ﬁeld work, both in Europe, Asia and North
America.
The project team will consist of two postdocs and one
ﬁeld/lab technician and two senior NHM scientists:
professor Jan T. Lifjeld and associate professor Arild
Johnsen (project leader). The project will be performed
in close collaboration with associate professor Kevin
Omland (University of Maryland, Baltimore County,

Natural History Museum, University of Oslo Postdoc-
toral position 2: Evolutionary Biology (Reproductive
Isolation)
The postdoc fellow will work on the project The early
stages of the speciation process - prezygotic reproduc-
tive isolation and diversiﬁcation in passerines, funded
by the Research Council of Norway and UiO. Speci-
ation is a fundamental evolutionary process in which
lineages diverge to form new species. Understanding
speciation processes is essential for understanding the
evolution of biodiversity. Spermatozoa are the most di-
verse cell types in the animal kingdom, indicating that
they evolve rapidly. Given the high evolvability and di-
vergence of sperm cells, we hypothesize that sperm cells
and their interaction with the female reproductive sys-
tem play crucial roles in promoting speciation in passer-
ine birds. The postdoctoral fellow will investigate the
role of such postmating, prezygotic selection as mecha-
nisms of reproductive isolation, by performing sperm
motility experiments in four species/subspecies pairs
with variable degree of divergence. The project will
require the use of a variety of analytical tools, like in-
vitro sperm motility analysis, proteomic analyses, and
comparative statistics. The project will include com-
prehensive ﬁeld work, both in Norway and elsewhere in
Europe.
The project team will consist of two postdocs and
one ﬁeld/lab technician and two senior NHM scien-
tists: professor Jan T. Lifjeld and associate professor
Arild Johnsen (project leader). The project will be
performed in close collaboration with professor Glenn-
Peter Sætre (CEES, UiO) and associate professor Anna

Ecology and Genetics, Evolutionary Biology Centre
(EBC) with starting date being May 1 ^st , 2012, or
as soon as possible after this date. The Evolutionary
Biology Center hosts one of the world’s largest aggrega-
tions of evolutionary biologists, and is a prime researchenvironment for a wide range of ﬁelds in evolutionary
biology and genetics (see “ http://www.ebc.uu.se/” for
more information). The working atmosphere is very
international with English as our operational language.
Uppsala University is the oldest university in Scandi-
navia and the city of Uppsala is a vibrant student town
with beautiful surroundings conveniently situated 40
minutes with train from Stockholm.
*Brief research outline: **The holder of this posi-
tion will direct research towards an evolutionary un-
derstanding of **the genomics of metabolic rate**. In-
sects (seed beetles) will serve as the model system.
The candidate will ﬁrst complete a collaborative eﬀort
to produce a /de novo/ complete genome sequence of
our main model system (/Callosobruchus maculatus/)
which is currently underway. The holder of this posi-
tion will then concentrate on the genetics of metabolic
rate using focussed genotype-phenotype matching and
upon sex-speciﬁc selection on discrete genotypes us-
ing experimental genomics. This research will involve
whole-organism phenotyping of metabolic rate (using
a state-of-the art respirometry system) and will focus
on those nuclear and mitochondrial genes that are in-
volved in the oxphos pathway and epistatic interactions
between these.*
*This post*doctoral position forms a part of a new
project on genetic conﬂict, funded by the European Re-
search Council and the Swedish Research Council. The
entire project will employ some 6-8 postdocs and PhD
students, apart from a full time TA and the PI, and
will strongly encourage interactions and collaborations
within the group.**
*Salary and appointment*: The period of initial ap-
pointment is two years, with the possibility of pro-
longing the contract with another two years *(i.e.,
2+2 years)*. Uppsala University adopts an individual
salary policy but the starting salary for postdoctoral
researchers is typically about 29.000 SEK per month
and includes full social beneﬁts.
*Eligibility:*The successful candidate must have a
Ph.D, or an exam which is judged comparable to a
PhD, that was completed within three years of the ap-
plication deadline. Applicants that received their PhD
earlier than this date will be considered if special cir-
cumstances exist (such as prolonged periods of illness,
parental leave, military service, union duties and others
of similar character).
*Qualiﬁcations and merits*: The ideal candidate has a
documented expertise in using genomic tools in evolu-
tionary biology and has a documented interest in the
study of phenotypic selection and/or general evolution-
ary theory. Experience of /de novo/ next-generationMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 119
sequencing is a merit, as is experience of genotype-
phenotype matching using genomic data and/or com-
parative genomics. Experience of laboratory work
with insects and/or previous experience of work with
respirometry phenotyping of metabolism will also be
considered merits. Because the holder of this position
will interact and collaborate closely with other mem-
bers of the group, we will put emphasis on both inde-
pendence and ability to collaborate. The holder of this
position will be responsible for orchestrating part of the
larger research project as an independent junior scien-
tist and the ideal candidate therefore already has some
postdoctoral research experience.**
*To apply:*Candidates should submit a cover letter, a
curriculum vitae including a list of publications and a

DrosophilaEvolutionaryGenomics
Postdoctoral Researcher in Drosophila Evolutionary
Genomics
A postdoctoral position is available in the recently-
formed research group of John Pool at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison. The focus of our research group
is on (1) analyzing population genomic data, includ-
ing the development of new statistical methods, and
(2) integrating population genomic data with other in-
formation sources - such as mapping, expression, and
phenotypic data - to investigate the genetic basis of
adaptive evolution. This position is targeted for the
latter focus.
We use Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to
pursue the genes and mutations that underlie adaptive
phenotypic diﬀerences between populations from con-
trasting environments. An example from previous work
is melanism, which occurs in African highland popu-
lations. Previous population genetic work identiﬁed
ebony as a candidate gene in one melanic population
(Pool and Aquadro 2007 Mol. Ecol.), and a subsequent
collaboration with Mark Rebeiz and Sean Carroll re-
sulted in the identiﬁcation of ﬁve causative mutations
around the abdominal enhancer of ebony (Rebeiz et
al. 2009 Science). However, at least one additional
pigmentation locus awaits discovery in this population
(Uganda), and for two other populations (Cameroon
and Ethiopia), the genetic basis of melanism is com-pletely unknown. I’d also like to broaden our focus to
other traits involved in Drosophila altitude adaptation.
Strategies for ﬁnding genes underlying adaptive pop-
ulation diﬀerences may include: * Analysis of exist-
ing population genomic data. More than 100 genomes
from African populations have already been sequenced
(www.dpgp.org/dpgp2/DPGP2.html ). Population ge-
netic scans for loci with elevated genetic diﬀerentiation
between high and low altitude populations would be rel-
evant. For larger sample sizes, genotype-phenotype as-
sociations may also be informative. * Generation (and
analysis) of new population genomic data. In terms
of lab work, this would involve identifying haploid em-
bryos, genome ampliﬁcation, and DNA library prepara-
tion for the Illumina HiSeq platform. After receiving se-
quence data, reference alignment and quality ﬁlters are
needed to produce a data object for population genomic
analysis. * Phenotypic measurements - quantiﬁcation
of Drosophila pigmentation (using digital photography
and analysis) and other adaptive traits. The use of in-
bred lines allows replicated phenotyping to reduce mea-
surement error in tests of genetic and geographic asso-
ciations. * Transcriptome analysis - to the extent that
adaptive changes are regulatory, gene expression dif-
ferences within and between populations could oﬀer a
valuable bridge between genomes and phenotypes. This
would involve RNA isolation and bioinformatic analy-
ses.
Our research group was started in fall 2011 and cur-
rently consists of the PI, one postdoc focusing on the
analysis of population genomic data, and undergradu-
ate researchers. I can oﬀer a new postdoc plenty of in-
dividual attention, broadly applicable training in popu-
lation genomics, and a ﬁrst-hand understanding of the
current faculty job market. I encourage postdocs to de-
velop as independent scientists, and I will support you
in putting together a research program that you can
carry beyond this appointment.
UW-Madison oﬀers a superb scientiﬁc environment,
with colleagues in population genetics and evolution-
ary genomics including David Baum, Sean Carroll,
Cameron Currie, Colin Dewey, John Doebley, Au-
drey Gasch, John Hawks, Chris Hittinger, Carol Lee,
Lawrence Loewe, Bret Payseur, and Nicole Perna.
There are roughly a dozen Drosophila groups on cam-
pus, including the labs of Bill Engels and Barry Ganet-
zky in our building.
Madison oﬀers an exceptional quality of life in a beau-
tiful natural setting. Downtown and campus are bor-
dered by lakes, and the area includes a number of long
distance bike trails. Madison features diverse art, mu-
sic, and cultural oﬀerings. A great farmers market andMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 123
a focus on local food are complemented by a wide range
of international restaurants.
Applicants should send a CV and contact information
for three references to jpool@wisc.edu. In addition, ap-
plicants should send a statement of interest addressing
their background and interests related to the following
points (note that the successful candidate may not have
every skill that I inquire about): * Intellectual back-
ground and interests; career goals. * Computer pro-
gramming (language, experience level) and other bioin-
formatic skills. * Statistical experience (such as popula-
tion genetic or quantitative genetic analyses). * Molec-
ular lab skills relevant to the work described above.
* Experience working with Drosophila; knowledge of
Drosophila biology.
Potential start dates are between April 1 and July 1,
2012. Please indicate the earliest start date you would
consider.

DrosophilaExperimentalEvolution
Senior postdoc position in Experimental Evolution in
Drosophila
By allowing for replication, experimental evolution
studies provide the fantastic opportunity to distin-
guish between directional forces (selection) and random
changes (drift). While adaptive responses on the phe-
notypic level are well studied, the potential of exper-
imental evolution studies to link genotypic, transcrip-
tomic and phenotypic responses is just starting to be
recognized. In a ﬁve-year ERC funded project, we are
using experimental evolution in Drosophila to study the
architecture of adaptation to a novel environment, by
linking genotypes, phenotypes and gene expression data
to variation in natural Drosophila populations.
We are searching for a senior postdoc, to work on this
project. The postdoc will serve a central role in manag-124 EvolDir March 1, 2012
ing the project, which includes the supervision of three
technicians and the collaboration with two other post-
docs and several PhD students. Qualiﬁed candidates
will be oﬀered the opportunity to develop into an in-
dependent group leader working on experimental evo-
lution in Drosophila.
Since the project requires a diverse set of skills ranging
from functional Drosophila genetics to bioinformatics
and statistical genetics, successful candidates will have
a solid background in at least one of the core areas and
a keen interest to collaborate with an interdisciplinary
team.
The position will be based at the Institute of Popula-
tion Genetics at the Vetmeduni Vienna (Austria). ).
The research focus of the Institute is on understand-
ing the genetics of adaptation. This central question in
evolutionary biology is being tackled using up-to-date
methods and a variety of approaches, including experi-
mental evolution, quantitative genetics, examination of
life history traits, Evo-Devo, empirical population ge-
netics, bioinformatics and statistics.
In recent years, Vienna has developed into one of
the leading centers in evolutionary biology ( http:/-
/www.evolvienna.at ). In addition, Vienna is home
to the VDRC Stock Center, and a high-proﬁle
Drosophila research community, most notably at the
IMP ( http://www.imp.ac.at/ ) and the IMBA ( http:/-

Project Summary: Collaborative Research: Phylogeny
and Evolution of World Tachinidae (Diptera)
Tachinidae are the most diverse and important group of
insect parasitoids outside the Hymenoptera. They are
also among the youngest and most rapidly diversifying
families of ﬂies. All tachinids are endoparasitoids, at-
tacking as a group at least 14 arthropod orders. They
parasitize this diversity of hosts with a remarkable array
of oviposition and reproductive strategies. As enemies
of other insects, particularly herbivores, tachinids play
important ecological roles in both natural and man-
aged ecosystems. Despite their diversity and impor-
tance, there has never been a comprehensive phyloge-
netic study of the family. Relationships among tribes
and subfamilies are obscure and the family is among the
most taxonomically diﬃcult of Diptera. The lack of a
robust and predictive classiﬁcation of Tachinidae has
hindered both basic and applied research on the fam-
ily. The goals of the proposed research are: (1.) Robust
reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships among ma-
jor tachinid lineages. (2.) Production of a stable, pre-
dictive classiﬁcation of Tachinidae. (3.) Focused phy-
logenetic analyses of two biologically interesting and
agronomically important groups, the tribe Blondeliini
and the subfamily Phasiinae. (4.) Analysis of the evo-
lution of reproductive traits, oviposition strategy, and
host associations and their eﬀects on diversiﬁcation and
biological control success. And (5.), dissemination of
taxonomic and biological information on Tachinidae.
Intellectual Merit: A sound tachinid phylogeny and a
reliable taxonomic infrastructure are necessary to un-
derstand their roles as enemies, the evolution of their
diverse attack strategies, and the causes of their rapid126 EvolDir March 1, 2012
evolutionary diversiﬁcation. With the aid of a net-
work of collaborators, relationships of world Tachinidae
(200+ genera, 50+ tribes, all four subfamilies) will be
inferred using 8-10 genes and a large (150+) array of
morphological characters. RNAseq methods will per-
mit new markers to be developed, establish robust basal
relationships, and provide a foundation for future ge-
nomic research on the family. We will provide an un-
precedented, broad scale phylogeny of Tachinidae with
which we can revise existing classiﬁcations and analyze
the evolution of key traits using comparative methods.
An understanding of the phylogenetic relationships and
evolution of Tachinidae will also inform broader issues
in biology such as historical biogeography, ecological
specialization, and adaptive radiation.Broader Impacts: A stable and predictive phylogeny
based classiﬁcation of Tachinidae will beneﬁt applied
and basic research and spur future work on this diverse
family. One post-doc, two graduate, and several under-
graduate students (as well as many collaborators) will
be involved in the research, receiving training in sys-
tematics, molecular techniques, and evolutionary anal-
yses. Research results will be used to develop college
courses/modules

This workshop, based on a concept developed by Steve
Stearns and John Maynard Smith, takes place in a small
Alpine village (Arolla), which will allow you to focus
while being able to enjoy the landscape and the Alpine
ﬂora.
The main goals of this course are to develop the follow-
ing skills: . developing your scientiﬁc ideas through dis-
cussions in groups; . thinking critically and expressing
oneself clearly; . turning a general idea into a research
project; . writing a research proposal and defending it.
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You,
as a group, will decide what the important questions
in broadly deﬁned evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back seat.
Additionally, the faculty will give informal talks about
their research and be available for informal discussion
with individual students. At the end you will present
your projects to other participants, and we will party.
Costs: CHF 430.- for room and board. There is no
tuition fee.

Dear Colleagues,
microMORPH is pleased to announce our second inter-
disciplinary workshop, ’Microevolution of Flower Form
and Function’ to be held at the Arnold Arboretum of
Harvard University in Boston, MA on May 11-13, 2012.
We are soliciting participation of graduate students and
post docs interested in exploring the intersection of de-
velopment and microevolution.
MICROMOPRH is an NSF funded Research Coordina-
tion Network (RCN). The goal of the RCN is to pro-
mote interdisciplinary interactions in evolutionary de-
velopmental biology at the emerging interface between
molecular developmental biology and the study of nat-
ural intraspeciﬁc and interspeciﬁc variation.
THE INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOPS bring to-
gether small groups of graduate students, post docs,
and faculty with very diﬀerent interests and expertise to
interact and discuss critical concepts, intellectual objec-
tives, emerging technologies, and analytical approaches130 EvolDir March 1, 2012
that have the potential to advance our understanding of
the evolution of plant form. All participants give pre-
sentations on their research and there is extensive dis-
cussion following each presentation. These workshops
provide students and faculty with unique opportunities
to explore new and challenging frontiers of knowledge.
We encourage applications from graduate students (at
all stages of their dissertation research) and post doc-
toral researchers now through March 9th, 2012. mi-
croMORPH will pay for travel, accommodations, and
meals for a select set of applicants who are US-citizens
or currently at US institutions (although non-US citi-
zens not currently associated with US institutions are
encouraged to apply, we cannot supply funding for
them).

NESCent Anatomy Ontologies
Jul30-Aug3
Title: Anatomy Ontologies in evolutionary biology and
genetics Primary instructors: Melissa Haendel, Matt
Yoder Guest instructors: Jim Balhoﬀ, Chris Mungall,
Carlo Torniai, Erik Segerdell Dates: July 30 - Au-
gust 3, 2012 Application deadline: April 6, 2012 Web-
site: academy.nescent.org Where: National Evolution-
ary Synthesis Center, Durham, NC
Evolutionary research has been revolutionized by the
explosion of genetic information available, and anatomy
ontologies must play a central crucial in relating this
knowledge to observable diversity. Anatomy ontolo-
gies and vocabularies are widely used to index data
and are critical for relating gene expression and pheno-
type data across taxa. Within a single species, anatomy
ontologies provide scaﬀolding that interconnects many
kinds of observations; across species, they provide evo-
lutionary, developmental, and mechanistic insights. In
order for anatomy ontologies to successfully serve all
of these purposes, they must be constructed consis-
tently so that they can be utilized and understood by
both researcher and software alike. This course aims
to teach proper ontology design principles and prac-
tices such that anatomical interoperability across evolu-
tionarily disparate taxa is achieved. It further seeks to
promote community growth and adoption of ontology-
based methods and tools. The subsequent beneﬁt is in
the form of shared access to the unique data store of
each community (e.g. genetic, genomic, developmental,
and evolutionary data).The course covers a basic introduction to ontology de-
sign principles and usage, speciﬁc ontology considera-
tions for anatomy, application of anatomy ontologies in
the context of evolutionary phenotype comparison, and
use of anatomy ontologies for image annotation in dif-
ferent taxa. There will be strong emphasis on hands-on
exercises that will develop ontology skills and provide
exposure to diﬀerent software applications that are use-
ful in variety of areas of evolutionary biology.
This course is co-sponsored by the Phenotype

As part of the NESCent Academy, we are pleased to
open applications for Evolutionary Quantitative Ge-
netics. In this workshop we will review the basics of
theory in the ﬁeld of evolutionary quantitative genetics
and its connections to evolution that is observed at var-
ious time scales. Quantitative genetics deals with the
inheritance of measurements of traits that are aﬀected
by many genes. Quantitative genetic theory for natural
populations was developed considerably in the period
1970-90 and up to the present time. It has been applied
to a wide range of phenomena including the evolution
of diﬀerences between the sexes, sexual preferences, life
history traits, plasticity of traits, as well as the evo-
lution of body size and other morphological measure-
ments. Textbooks have not kept pace with these de-
velopments, and currently few universities oﬀer courses
in this subject aimed at evolutionary biologists. There
is a need for evolutionary biologists to understand this
ﬁeld because of the ability to collect large amounts ofMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 133
data by computer, the development of statistical meth-
ods for changes of traits on evolutionary trees and for
changes in a single species through time, and the re-
alization that quantitative characters will not soon be
fully explained by genomics. This workshop aims to
ﬁll this need by reviewing basic aspects of theory and
illustrating how that theory can be tested with data.
Participants will learn to use R, an open-source sta-
tistical programming language, to build and test evo-
lutionary models. The intended participants for this
workshop are graduate students, postdocs, and junior
faculty members in evolutionary biology.
The course is co-sponsored by the American Society of
Naturalists, and reduced tuition will be oﬀered to par-
ticipants who are ASN members.

The GTPB course IB12, “Introductory Bioinformatics”
is now open for applications. The instructors will be
David P Judge (Cambridge University) Phil Cunning-
ham (Kings College, London) Pedro Fernandes (IGC,
Oeiras)
The level of the course is intermediate. The reason why
it is called “Introductory” is the low level of the pre-
requisites: no previous contact with Bioinformatics will
be required.
In this course we will use a set of biological questions to
illustrate several techniques that altogether enable the
participant to acquire practical skills on how to anal-
yse biological sequences and produce inferential results.
The participants will exercise these skills to the point of
being able to use them autonomously. We will dedicate
one day to train the participants with short read se-
quencing data, also called Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS).
The course starts on March 12th and lasts until March
16th (5 days) Applications are open until March 5th,
but can be closed earlier due to the predictably high
level of demand.

Call for Applications
International Interdisciplinary Summer School:
“The Evolution of Morality”
T¨ ubingen, June 12th - 16th
Topic It is a well known saying that “nothing in Biology
makes sense except in the light of evolution” (Dobzhan-
sky). Thus, what kind of new perspectives and impli-
cations can be drawn from insights of the theory of evo-
lution for the understanding of the morality of human
beings? Therefore, this year’s Unseld summer school
will focus on the evolutionary fundaments of morality
presenting as lecturer the primatologist Frans de Waal.
Spending much time watch-ing the behavior of apes and
monkeys, de Waal brings forward the argument that the
core concept of morality has already been present in the
pre-social tendencies of nonhuman pri-mates. As a con-
sequence he attacks what he calls the “Veneer Theory”,
which holds that human ethics and morality - estab-
lished as a cultural innovation - would only be a thin
crust masking our Hobbesian brutish nature. On the
contrary, de Waal proposes that moral actions are direct
consequences of social instincts and capabilities com-
mon to humans and nonhuman primates. This claim is
based on emotive theories of ethics, which claim that
mo-rality is “determined by sentiment” (Hume): In this
respect the capacities for sympathy, em-pathy and co-
operation as well as reciprocal psychological altruism
are crucial.
Taking its cue from de Waals position the summer
school will confront this position with oth-ers, and
particularly with philosophical perspectives. Philip136 EvolDir March 1, 2012
Kitcher, for example, has pre-sented a careful discussion
of the degrees of reciprocal psychological altruism which
are beyond the nonhuman primates’ capacities. Con-
sequently he holds that this disposition is no suﬃcient
condition for the rise of moral behaviour. Also, it has
been argued that empathy does not constitute a funda-
mental criterion of moral agency. In this way Christine
M. Korsgaard, one among de Waal’s commentators in
his book “Primates and Philosophers”, puts forward
the argument that nonhuman primates are crea-tures
that act on whatever desire or impulse is the strongest
at a given moment, but they lack the autonomy with
which a person can evaluate those impulses and thus
choose inten-tionally. Without the ability to step back
and reﬂect on these impulses, nonhuman primates fail
to satisfy a necessary condition for moral agency.
As a consequence the criteria of hu-man moral agency
should include far more than empathic or altruistic dis-
positions. Ulti-mately, according to our second lecturer
Gerhard Ernst it is problematic to state that morality
has evolved out of sentiments and dispositions. He dis-
agrees with the emotivists’ view that the truth or justi-
ﬁcation of moral judgments were relative to emotional
attitudes of the speaker since then moral judgments
would lack the normative force that we contend these
judgments may have. Thus, Ernst suggests to think of
morality as being related to the natural world in a sim-
ilar way as sciences are themselves. Both, science and
morality are faculties of human reason.
The summer school will focus on the hotly debated dis-
course of what constitutes morality. It will be discussed
what it precisely means that human moral agency has
its roots in our evo-lutionary ancestors. Hence, it will
be reﬂected both, the importance and the diﬃculty of
the question about the criteria of human moral agency.
Program
This year ˆAs Unseld summer school organized by the
Forum Scientiarum of Tuebingen Uni-versity will take
place from June 12th afternoon to June 16th noon.
Twenty graduate students and junior sci ˆAfrom all over
the world will have the opportu-nity to work on the
question of the evolution of morality with Professor
Frans de Waal and Professor Gerhard Ernst. In the
mornings selected participants will have the opportu-
nity to present their own projects pursuing the evolu-
tion of morality and discuss these with the lec-turers
and the group. The afternoon sessions of the summer
school will focus on the works of Frans de Waal and
Gerhard Ernst. The attendees of the summer school
will also follow the Unseld Lecture on the Evolution of
Morality held by Frans de Waal and an interdisciplinary
discussion between Frans de Waal and Gerhard Ernstopen to the public, both events taking place during the
course schedule.
Application procedure
To apply for the international summer school, partici-
pants need to submit an abstract of up to 1000 words
presenting their own projects on the topic of the evo-
lution of morality. From these we will select a num-
ber to be presented during the morning sessions of the
course. In addition, an application form downloadable

Applications are invited for a BBSRC-Sponsored Sum-
mer School in Molecular Evolution and Diversity, to
be held at Lincoln Hall of the University of Notting-
ham, from midday on Monday the 30th July 2010 until
midday on Friday, the 3rd August 2012. The Sum-
mer School is designed for researchers in quantitative
aspects of Evolutionary Biology, looking at genetic vari-
ation both between- and within- species.
The course is mainly, although not exclusively, for early
career researchers who wish to gain a greater under-
standing of the quantitative and theoretical tools that
will aid their interpretation of evolutionary data. The
course will include plenary talks from experts in pop-
ulation genetics and molecular evolutionary analyses.
There will be practical (computer) sessions, intended to
help participants in the analysis of sequence and other
types of data, and to understand how these analyses
can be used to study important biological questions.
Attendees will be asked to present a short talk or a
poster about their research project.
Places on the course are free, and, while we expect 90%
of those chosen for the course to be postdoctoral or
postgraduate researchers, 10% of places have been re-
served for more experienced researchers. We are unable
to pay travel expenses for those attending the course.
Places are not restricted to BBSRC-funded researchers.
Applications will be via the website: http://-
www.nottingham.ac.uk/biology/resources/bbsrc-
summer-school.aspx The closing date for applications
will be Friday, the 20th April 2012. Successful appli-
cants will be expected to attend the whole meeting.
Those who have attended previous Summer Schools in
this series will not be selected. We aim to inform can-
didates whether their application has been successfulby Friday, 4th May 2012.
The application form will ask for a poster or talk ti-
tle and abstract, and also the supervisor’s name (if
relevant) and department and institution. The Sum-
mer School will cover the following areas of micro- and
macro-evolution:

Programme This advanced course covers statistical
methods currently used to map disease susceptibility
genes, with an emphasis on (but not limited to) meth-
ods that can analyse family data or a combination
of families and individuals. Discussions of the latest
statistical methodology are complemented by practical
hands-on computer exercises using state-of-the-art soft-
ware. The statistical basics behind each method will
be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand.
With a focus on family data, we will discuss funda-
mental issues needed to increase success in gene map-
ping studies including: optimal study design, power to
detect linkage and association, determining the most
appropriate statistical methods and software, interpre-
tation of statistical results and trouble shooting. We
will also cover the basic principles of statistical infer-
ence, hypothesis testing, population and quantitativegenetics and Mendelian inheritance. Our interactive
and intensive educational program will enable one to
better carry out sophisticated statistical analyses of ge-
netic data, and will also improve one’s interpretation
and understanding of the results. All the software used

HaemosporidianEvolution Aug6-9
*FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT*
Second Annual International Workshop on Malaria and
Related Haemosporidian Parasites of Wildlife
Monday August 6th - Thursday August 9th, 2012
National Conservation Training Center, Shepherd-
stown, West Virginia
Sponsored by the NSF Research Coordination Network
for Haemosporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (1)
Dear Colleagues,
The NSF-sponsored Research Coordination Network
for Haemosporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (Malar-
iaRCN) is pleased to announce our second annual
workshop on the malaria parasites and closely related
haemosporidians of natural populations of vertebrates.March 1, 2012 EvolDir 139
The four day workshop will include both ﬁeld and lab-
oratory exercises as well as lectures and discussions led
by RCN members (2).
Topics to be covered throughout the workshop include
vertebrate ﬁeld capture techniques, blood sampling and
preparation of blood smears, sample vouchering and
preservation, parasite taxonomy, light microscopy for
parasite identiﬁcation and parasite and cell counts, se-
quence data analysis, phylogenetics, parasite evolution,
and databasing. Discussion topics will include, but are
not limited to, the basic biology, phylogenetics and sys-
tematics of Haemosporida, community ecology of par-
asites, coevolution and the evolution of virulence, and
conservation and disease.
All food, lodging and workshop events will take place
at the US Fish & Wildlife Service’s National Conser-
vation Training Center in Shepherdstown, West Vir-
ginia, a site easily accessible through Washington, D.C.
area airports. The workshop will commence on Mon-
day morning, August 6th, and continue through until
the evening of Thursday, August 9th.
The workshop is geared towards graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, and other investigators new to
the ﬁeld of wildlife haemosporidians. We will be accept-
ing applications in early 2012 and encourage individu-
als from outside the United States, particularly from
developing countries. Applications will be available in
early February 2012 through the RCN website. Work-
shop cost, accommodations, meals, and transportation
from the Washington Dulles International Airport will
be covered by the RCN grant for workshop participants.
In addition, applications for travel funds will be con-
sidered. Additional information on the workshop in-
cluding an overview of the four days of events will be
provided with the Second Workshop Announcement as
well as on the RCN website ( http://malariarcn.org/ ).
We encourage you to register on the RCN website and
become a member of the Malaria Research Coordina-
tion Network. In the meantime, further information
can be obtained from the workshop organizers (email:
MalariaRCNWorkshop@gmail.com).
(1) The Research Coordination Network for Haemo-
sporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (“Malaria RCN”),
sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation
and funded through 2015 at the University of Missouri-
St. Louis, was established to promote communication
among researchers working on the ecology and evolu-
tion of haemosporidian parasites of vertebrate wildlife
populations. Please visit the website for the network
(www.malariarcn.org ) for more information.
(2) Workshop organizers include Robert Ricklefs (Uni-
versity of Missouri - St. Louis), Ellen Martinsen(Smithsonian Institution), Staﬀan Bensch (Lund Uni-
versity), Gediminas Valkiunas (Nature Research Cen-
ter, Vilnius), Carter Atkinson (USGS), and Ravinder
Sehgal (San Francisco State University). Other mem-
bers of this RCN include Patricia Parker (University of
Missouri - St. Louis), Robert Fleischer (Smithsonian
Institution), Susan Perkins (American Museum of Nat-
ural History), Tom Smith (University of California, Los
Angeles), and Robert Adlard (Queensland Museum).
*The workshop is likely to be of interest to evolutionary
biologists as it will center around the systematics of a
very successful and diverse group of parasites of natu-
ral vertebrate populations. The workshop will include
readings and discussions on the evolution of the haemo-
sporidian parsites and include laboratory exercises in-
volving phylogenetic analysis of parasite lineages.

Main Page Now in its 25th year, the MBL’s Work-
shop on Molecular Evolution at Woods Hole presents
a series of lectures, discussions, and bioinformatic
exercises that span contemporary topics in molec-
ular evolution. The workshop encourages the ex-
change of ideas among leading theoreticians, software
developers, and workshop participants. The work-
shop serves graduate students, postdoctoral students,
and established faculty from around the world. The
2012 Workshop will use computer packages includ-
ing AWTY, BEAST, Clustal W/X, FASTA, FigTree,
GARLI, MIGRATE, LAMARC, MAFFT, MrBayes,
PAML, PAUP*, PHYLIP, and SeaView to address the140 EvolDir March 1, 2012
following topics:
Phylogenetic analysis: theoretical, mathematical, and
statistical bases; sampling properties of sequence data;
Maximum likelihood theory and practice; Bayesian
analysis; hypothesis testing
Population genetics analysis using coalescence theory;
maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation of popu-
lation genetic parameters
Databases and sequence matching: database searching:
protein sequence versus protein structure; homology;
mathematical, statistical, and theoretical aspects of se-
quence database searches; multiple alignment
Molecular evolution integrated at organism and higher
levels: population biology; biogeography; ecology; sys-tematics and conservation
Molecular evolution and development: gene duplication
and divergence; gene family organization; coordinated
expression in evolution
Comparative genomics: genome content; genome struc-
ture; genome evolution
Molecular evolution integrated at lower levels: bio-
chemistry; cell biology; physiology; relationship of
genotype to phenotype
Students will work with computer packages on their
own laptops and have the opportunity to use the high
performance computer clusters at the MBL.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
AfterwordMarch 1, 2012 EvolDir 141
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
