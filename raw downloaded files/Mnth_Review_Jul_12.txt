Sep29-Oct1
We would like to invite you and your students to at-
tend the 1st International Student Congress of Evolu-
tionary Biology in Middle East Technical University,
Ankara/Turkey from 29 September - 1 October.
- We decided to organize this congress because of lack
of an Evolutionary Biology Congress for students and
also increasing attacks of fundamentalist and ignored
opponents of the evolution. We want to sharing of in-
formation about Evolutionary Biology between the stu-
dents comes from all over the world. Also want to show,
young people adopt the Theory of Evolution.
Make an announcement to large masses is very impor-
tant for us. If you will inform about our congress to
your students also your colleagues, we will be thankful.

Leipzig Retrovirus Aug26-29
I'm writing on behalf of the organizing committee for
the 11th International Feline Retrovirus Research Sym-
posium (IFRRS) to be held August 26-29, 2012 in
Leipzig (Germany) and would like bring the symposium
to the attention of the 'Evolution Directory' readers:
The IFRRS is a bi-annual conference which brings to-
gether renowned experts from the international scien-
tic community who study feline retroviruses and re-
lated topics and employ feline models of retroviral re-
search. The symposium focuses on the latest advances
in genomics, immunology, and infectious disease as well
as gene therapy, anti-viral therapy and vaccine develop-
ment from the perspective of feline health and the po-tential translational applications to human health. The
IFRRS attracts and brings together a large group of re-
searchers from academia, industry, and clinical special-
ists in veterinary as well as human medicine. As such
the symposium provides a forum to share latest cutting-
edge research ndings and ideas and to foster collabora-
tive eorts to improve feline and human health. Due to
several requests we extended the deadlines for early reg-
istration and abstract submission for the 11th Interna-
tional Feline Retrovirus Research Symposium (IFRRS)
until 15th of June 2012!
The symposium will start with a workshop on bioin-
formatics/genomic tools and a session on feline ge-
nomics/viral evolution. The following days will cover
research areas including retroviral pathogenesis, restric-
tion factors, immune response/modulation, vaccines
and clinical/therapeutic aspects. The last day will fo-
cus on other feline viral infections and emerging dis-
eases in cats. We look forwards to welcome you in
Leipzig to share latest cutting-edge research ndings on
viral diseases of cats and to foster collaborative eorts
to improve feline and human health.
All informations for the symposium can be found on
our website at www.ifrrs.org.
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to con-
tact us.
On behalf of the organizing committee
Yours sincerely,

Madison EvoSysBio Jul30-Aug1
Dear All,
For those with an interest in interdisciplinary meetings,
here is a perfect excuse to visit beautiful Madison, Wis-
consin at short notice.
>From July 30 to Aug 1, 2012 will be the rst meeting
on Evolutionary Systems Biology with an associated
workshop on modeling languages at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison:
http://evolutionarysystemsbiology.org/meeting/2012-
Madison/ The purpose of the EvoSysBio meeting is
to explore, how to best bring together evolutionary
biology and current systems biology and what new
insights might result from this. Evolutionary systems
biology analyses critically depend on our ability to
build and analyze quantitative models of dynamical
systems. Many important questions will require
such quantitative analyses on scales that demand
full automation. Appropriately designed problem
specic programming languages are a powerful way
for achieving such automation. The purpose of the
associated workshop on modeling languages is to
collect examples for what analyses might be desirable
and how a modeling language might look like that
could facilitate this. This is a place where you can
say what you want! This discussion will inform future
development of evolvix, a new user friendly model de-
scription language currently under development in the
Evolutionary Systems Biology Group at UW-Madison.
The meeting is free, but registration is required for
catering and other reasons. Registration will be open
until July 21 and is easy, see link on website.
Posters can be contributed until July 21 and there is
still the possibility to compete for a very small number8 EvolDir July 1, 2012
of talks.
We expect many exciting interdisciplinary discussions
and look forward to seeing you in Madison!
All the best, Laurence Loewe

Tenth Annual RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Com-
parative Genomics
October 17-19, 2012, Niter oi, Brazil
Website: www.u.br/recombcg ** Due to several re-
quests, the submission deadline has been extended to
June 19th **
The increasing amount of genome-related data is a
fruitful source for biological research. By comparing
complete or partial genomes it is possible to infer a
great amount of new biological information, includ-
ing gene function, evolutionary relationship between
species and ancestral genome organization. Due to the
dimension of the available data, ecient computational
tools are imperative to accomplish these tasks.
The RECOMB CG satellite workshop brings together
leading researchers in the mathematical, computational
and life sciences to discuss cutting edge research in com-
parative genomics, with an emphasis on computational
approaches and novel experimental results. The pro-
gram will include both invited speakers and contributed
talks.
Contributions to the workshop are welcomed on any
theoretical and/or empirical approach to genome-wide
comparison. This includes genome evolution, algo-
rithms for genome rearrangement, comparative tools
for assembly, gene identication or annotation, com-
parison of functional networks, genomic variation in
humans and model organisms, cancer genomics, dupli-
cation patterns of genes, segments and whole genomes,
and comparative epigenetics. We encourage paper sub-
missions that oer new biological ndings or otherwise
highlight their relevance to biology. Refereed papers
will be published as open-access manuscripts in the
journal BMC Bioinformatics.
The workshop will be held on the campus of the Uni-
versidade Federal Fluminense, in Niter oi, Brazil.

THEME AND SCOPE
The continuing advance of DNA sequencing technol-
ogy has produced an avalanche of genome sequence
and genome structural information across the evolu-
tionary spectrum. Transforming that information into
biological knowledge requires creative and innovative
new computational and statistical methods for compar-
ative genomics.
The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Ge-
nomics aims to provide the premier forum for new com-
putational developments applied to all aspects of com-
parative genomics. We solicit contributions on topics
including comparison of genome structure and organi-
zation, genome function, and evolution. We particu-
larly encourage contributions that use new computa-
tional methods to acquire new insight into biological
processes. Advances in computational theory are wel-
come, though all submissions should include genome-
scale analyses informed by comparative data.
All peer-reviewed and accepted RECOMB-CG
manuscripts will be published in a supplement to BMC
Bioinformatics as open-access, author-subsidized,
articles.
Specic topics of interest include but are not limited
to:
. Gene and genome duplication . Gene family evolution
. Genome structural variation . Algorithms for compar-
ative genomics . Genome rearrangements . Ancestral
genome reconstruction . Multiple genome alignment
. Genome sequence comparison . Modeling genome
evolution . Comparative genomics for genome anno-
tation . Gene tree reconciliation . Species and gene
tree inference . Comparative metagenomics . Compar-
ative genomics linked to proteomics, metabolomics, and
other ~omic data . Comparative genomics and gene ex-
pression and regulation . Applications of comparative
genomic methods

proposed section would compliment SSE members' sci-
entic interests and address the practical career needs
of members who teach. As a rst step, the commit-
tee has proposed to hold a one day mini-conference
on teaching evolution immediately following the Evolu-
tion 2013 main conference. This mini-conference would
not replace education activities during the main meet-
ing which include the Education Symposium, an edu-
cation strand, and and posters. A planning meeting
will be held at Evolution 2012 on Sunday morning,
July 8. The rst hour will be for public comments,10 EvolDir July 1, 2012
ideas, and requests for both the mini-conference and
an education section. The second hour will be a plan-
ning committee meeting. If you would like to volun-

Computational and Statistical Phylogenomics meeting
Vigo, Spain, September 13-14, 2012
Dear all,
We are organizing an international meeting on Com-
putational and Statistical Phylogenomics in Vigo, NW
Spain, this September that might be of your interest:
http://csphylo12.uvigo.es/ There will be invited talks
by some of the most relevant scientists in the eld, but
no contributed talks. Conrmed speakers are: Bastien
Boussau (USA), Oliver Eulenstein (USA), Olivier Gas-
cuel (France), Laura Kubatko (USA), Jens Lagergren(Sweden), Nicolas Lartillot (Canada), Luay Nakleh
(USA), Alexis Stamatakis (Germany), Marc Suchard
(USA), Tandy Warnow (USA) and Ziheng Yang (UK).
We hope this meeting becomes a platform for the ex-
change of ideas, brainstorming and discussion around
phylogenomics. We believe this is a timely meeting
given that NGS techniques have opened a new era in
phylogenomics, prompting the need for accurate statis-
tical methods that take into account the complexities
of this type of data and are implemented in ecient
computational tools.
Besides the science, we will organize some social ac-
tivities, like a visit to a National Park nearby at the
astonishing Cies Islands.
For any questions, please contact us at
csphylo12@gmail.com.
All the best,

\Ecological interactions at surfaces and interfaces"
The International Max Planck Research School (IM-
PRS) \The Exploration of Ecological Interactions with
Molecular and Chemical Techniques" in Jena, Ger-
many, invites applications for 6 PhD fellowships begin-
ning in January 2013.
Many key ecological interactions between plants, her-
bivores, bacteria and fungi occur at dierent surfaces.
These form the boundaries between organisms and their
aerial, aquatic, or subterranean environments, as well
as the interfaces of organisms interacting with each
other. The release or detection of odors and other
chemical signals occurs at surfaces; surface biolms
made by bacteria and diatoms create unique environ-
mental niches. Yet very little information is available on
compounds and proteins playing a role in the local com-
munication processes at these interfaces. New methods
are required to study these interactions at a mecha-
nistic level. Our aim is to develop such methods and
apply them to dierent projects and research questions.
Approaches will include mass spectrometry based tech-
niques and dierent imaging technologies. The devel-
opment of new bioinformatics tools for data analysis
is also needed. A complete list of projects oered is
available on our website.
We are looking for enthusiastic PhD students with
strong interests in the above described central topic.
Applicants should have a rm background in one of the
following elds: bioinformatics, analytical chemistry,
entomology, neurobiology, molecular biology, biochem-
istry, plant physiology and genetics. All our projects
are highly integrative and require willingness to closely
collaborate with researchers of dierent backgrounds.July 1, 2012 EvolDir 15
The Research School is a joint initiative of the
Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Friedrich
Schiller University, Jena, the Leibniz Institute for Nat-
ural Product Research and Infection Biology, and the
Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Re-
search. We oer state of the art equipment, an excellent
research environment, supervision by a thesis commit-
tee and a structured training program including scien-
tic courses, training in transferable skills and internal
conferences. Successful candidates will receive an IM-
PRS fellowship. Working language is English.

formatics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology
We are inviting applications for a PhD position in the
evolutionary ecology department to work on a project
dealing with detecting patterns of selection and adap-
tation across three-spined stickleback genomes using
next-generation sequencing data. The position is avail-
able starting August/September 2012 and is funded for
3 years.
We are looking for a motivated student with a back-
ground in bioinformatics andstrong interests in genome
evolution, population genetics and speciation. The suc-
cessful candidate can choose to work on various aspects
of genome evolution across stickleback populations and
will be required to analyse genomic data. Computer
programming/scripting skills are desirable, and experi-ence dealing with next generation sequencing data or
databases is a plus. Additional wet lab work is possible
if desired to aid in validating results.
The three-spined stickleback /Gasterosteus aculeatus
/has become a model organism for evolutionary ecol-
ogy because of its repeated independent adaptations to
dierent freshwater environments within the last few
thousand years, the associated morphological changes
such as loss of bony armour, and a well-annotated refer-
ence genome. Our main focus deals with investigating
genome architecture across various populations from
distinct environments harbouring habitat-specic par-
asite communities. We have previously shown experi-
mentally that parasites can select for particular resis-
tant alleles in stickleback populations that increase in
frequency in a single generation. The analysis of high
throughput sequence data will therefore enable us to
garner a broader genome-wide understanding of the ge-
netic changes underlying such adaptations and popula-
tion dierentiation in an ecological context.
The research will be carried out in the lab of Prof. Man-
fred Milinski (http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/-
abteilungen/evolutionsoekologie/index.html) in close
collaboration with PhD students and postdocs as well
as with Prof. Thorsten Reusch from the Helmholtz
Centre for Marine Sciences (IFM-Geomar), Prof. Erich
Bornberg-Bauer (University of M unster) and Prof.
Monika Stoll (Leibniz-Institute M unster). As a Max
Planck Institute we have labs and technical equipment
of the highest standards including facilities for genome
analysis. The MPI for Evolutionary Biology oers a
stimulating scientic environment dedicated to evolu-
tionary biology. The working language at the institute
is English.
Our institute is located in Pl on, a Northern German
town surrounded by lakes and ideal for outdoor activ-
ities. In the vicinity are two major cities (Kiel and
L ubeck) as well as the Baltic Sea. Hamburg is reach-
able by train or car in 90 minutes. The institute main-
tains links to the Christian Albrechts University of Kiel
and the Helmholtz Centre for Marine Sciences (IFM-
Geomar).
The Max Planck Society is an equal opportunity em-
ployer and encourages female scientists and scientists
with disabilities to apply.
We ask applicants to send a PDF of their CV and mo-
tivation letter as well as contact information of two ref-
erences by e-mail to milinski@evolbio.mpg.de We will
begin reviewing applications starting July 2 ^nd until

FossilPrimates
*Fully-funded 3 YEAR PhD studentship at Trinity Col-
lege Dublin, Ireland*
Evolutionary ecology and extinct species: how do fossils
change our interpretations of present-day biodiversity
patterns?
Evolutionary ecology, the study of patterns and pro-
cesses at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecol-
ogy, is an exciting and rapidly growing research area.
However, most studies ignore one important factor: ex-
tinction. The aim of this PhD project is to test and
develop methods for adding fossil species into phyloge-
nies and evolutionary ecology analyses, using primates
as a study group.
Primates are a fascinating group in which to study
the eects of extinct species because there is substan-
tial extinct diversity in the order. There are currently
376 species in two suborders: Strepsirrhini (lemurs,
lorises, galagos and aye-ayes: 88 species) and Haplor-
rhini (tarsiers, New World monkeys, Old World mon-
keys and apes: 288 species). The earliest primate fossils
date from around 55 million years ago during the early
Eocene, and come from two major groups; Adapoidea
(putative ancestors of Strepsirrhini) and Omomyoidea
(putative ancestors of Haplorrhini). These primates
were widespread, ranging across North America, Asia,
Europe and Africa, and also species rich (nearly 100
species in each group) so apparently represented very
successful radiations. However, the majority of these
species were extinct by the end of the Eocene. Other
fossil primates became extinct more recently, for ex-
ample, at least one of the 17 species of extinct giant
lemurs in Madagascar may have survived into the 17th
century. These species are particularly interesting be-
cause they range in body mass from approximately 10-
160kg, whereas present-day lemurs have a maximum
body mass of only around 7kg.
The student will rst collate a morphological dataset
for extant and extinct primates, using published sources
and collecting extra data from museums in the USA and
UK. They will then build phylogenies using Bayesian
approaches, and nally they will use these phyloge-
nies to tackle interesting evolutionary ecology ques-
tions. The exact questions tackled will depend on the
interests of the student. However, some potential ques-18 EvolDir July 1, 2012
tions include: (i) Can historical primate extinctions
be explained by competition with other species of pri-
mate? (ii) Does adding extinct giant lemurs into anal-
yses of primate body size evolution alter our conclu-
sions about rates of evolution in primates, particularly
in the Strepsirrhini (lemurs and relatives)? (iii) If all
of the presently endangered primates become extinct,
what will the consequences be for the morphological
and functional diversity of primates? How will this
aect the functioning of the ecosystems they inhabit?
The results of these a nalyses will have implications for
evolutionary ecology methods, evolutionary theory, and
conservation planning.
The project will be supervised by Dr. Natalie Cooper at
the School of Natural Sciences, Trinity College Dublin.
The School is particularly strong in the area of Ecology
and Evolution, with a dedicated seminar series and a
range of peer-learning initiatives. The expected start
date is September 2012. Full funding is provided for a
3 year PhD studentship from Trinity College Dublin.
Stipend is euro 16,000 per annum plus fees for 3 years.
There are no limitations on student nationality.
Applicants must have (or realistically expect to achieve)
a rst or upper second class Bachelors, or Masters de-
gree in a relevant subject (Biology, Ecology, Anthro-
pology, Palaeontology, Mathematics, Statistics or sim-
ilar). The candidate will preferably have a high-level
of numerical competency. Much of this work is collab-
orative and the candidate will be expected to be keen,
motivated and willing to work as part of a team. In
addition, applicants must be competent in written and
spoken English and be prepared to travel to the USA
and UK for data collection and collaborator meetings.
Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae detail-
ing their qualications and experience and contain-
ing the names and contact details of at least two ref-
erees, together with a covering letter explaining why
they wish to pursue this project. Please direct any
enquiries about the research to Dr. Natalie Cooper

*PhD PROPOSAL*
*Post-copulatory sexual selection in the houbara bus-
tard*
/A three year PhD position is available to work on a
collaborative project dealing with the post-copulatory
sexual selection in the houbara bustard./
In most animal species, females mate with multiple
males giving rise to the potential for sperm competition
and cryptic female choice. These post-copulatory com-
ponents of sexual selection add to those acting on males
to attract mates (pre-copulatory sexual selection).
Although the study of post-copulatory sexual selection
has ourished in the last decade, there are very few bi-
ological systems that are amenable to the experimental
study of sperm competition and cryptic choice.
Houbara bustards are endangered bird species living in
North Africa (/Chlamydotis undulata/), Middle East
and Central Asia (/Chlamydotis macqueeni/). In or-
der to restore and reinforce natural populations of
houbara in Middle East, the National Avian Research
Center (NARC) has promoted a captive breeding pro-
gram in Abu Dhabi (EAU) under the leadership of the
International Fund for Houbara Conservation. This
breeding program is based on the collection of sperm
which is subsequently used to articially inseminate fe-
males under standardized conditions (Saint Jalme et al.
1994). This allows investigating several aspects related
to sperm competition and cryptic choice, in a species
where both pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection is
supposed to be a strong selective force. Indeed, males
harbor extravagant sexual displays (Charg e et al. 2010,
2011; Preston et al. 2011) and females have been shown
to mate with multiple males in the wild, where the pro-
portion of clutches sired by multiple fathers is fairly
high (60%) (Lesobre et al. 2010).
In the rst stage of the PhD thesis, we expect to better
characterize sperm traits that determine the likelihood
to successfully fertilize eggs. Then, experimental work
could be conducted to explore the following questions:
1)Is there a trade-o between pre- and post-copulatory
components of sexual selection?
2)Is fertilization success mostly driven by sperm com-
petition or cryptic choice?July 1, 2012 EvolDir 19
3)Is there a scope for sexual conict in this system?
In addition to their fundamental interest, the obtained
results could also be valuable with respect to the genetic
management of the captive breeding. On one hand, in-
seminating with a mix of semen could facilitate insem-
ination procedure by reducing the time spent to select
precise pedigree and by optimizing semen utilization
(mixture of small ejaculates that are usually discarded
could be easily used). On the other hand, sperm com-
petition might result in severely biased paternity with
a potential for strong involuntary selection acting on
breeding males.
This is a collaborative project involving the NARC
(Yves Hingrat, Loic Lesobre, Tony Chalah) where all
the experimental work will be carried out and where
the successful applicant will spend most of the time,
the French CNRS in Dijon (Gabriele Sorci) and the Mu-
seum of Natural History in Paris (Michel Saint Jalme).

Endangered species genetics
We are seeking expressions of interest from individuals
who wish to apply for a fully funded PhD studentship,
investigating the application of molecular tools to the
management of breeding programmes for endangered
species. The research will focus on African wild dogs
and pygmy hippos but there is considerable scope for
wider applications.
Applicants will be considered for nomination as a
candidate for an International Postgraduate Research
Scholarship (IPRS) tenable at the University of West-
ern Australia: http://www.scholarships.uwa.edu.au/-
future-students/postgrad/international .If successful in
any subsequent application for a scholarship, the PhD
candidate will be co-supervised jointly by the Univer-
sity of Western Australia and the University of Chester
(UK), with the student spending time at both institu-
tions. Please note that there will be a further applica-
tion process to undertake at a later point.
Given the precarious status of many in-situ large mam-
mal populations, the need to establish long-term, viable
breeding programmes in zoos, will become increasingly
important. The goal of these breeding programmes is to
maintain genetic diversity and reduce inbreeding over
multiple generations. To help achieve this, studbooks
are in place that provide breeding recommendations to
ensure unrelated animals are paired together. How-
ever, to do this eectively, the genetic relatedness of
the founders needs to be known. In reality this data
is not available and so the default position is that all
founders are assumed to be unrelated.
This PhD project will assess the founder relatedness in
the African wild dog and the pygmy hippo studbooks
to test the validity of the assumption of zero related-
ness amongst founders. The genetic relatedness of the
contemporary population will also be established and,
importantly, genetically under-represented individuals
will be identied for gene banking. This is an exciting
opportunity to make a signicant impact on conserva-
tion of endangered species.20 EvolDir July 1, 2012
Successful candidates should have a strong background
in genetics, or evolutionary biology. Experience with
a wide range of molecular techniques is essential and a
strong interest in conservation is desirable. It also a key
requirement that the candidate has at last one scientic
publication to ensure competitiveness for a scholarship.
Interested candidates should contact Dr. Paul
O'Donoghue (p.odonoghue@chester.ac.uk) or Dr
Monique Paris (mparis@ibream.org) for further
information.
Expressions of interest are invited until July 7th

UIceland AmphipodEvolGenomics
Ph.D. position in evolutionary biology - evolutionary
genomics of a groundwater amphipod.
A three year PhD position is available at the Depart-
ment of Life and Environmental Scicences at University
of Iceland, Reykjavik, supervised by Snbj orn P alsson,
Associate professor, in collaboration with Christophe
J. Douady, Professor at Claude Bernard University in
Lyon, France.
The project is on population and evolutionary genomics
of Crangonyx islandicus, a recently discovered sub-
terranean amphipod endemic to Iceland. Novel high
throughput sequencing methods will be applied. Firstly
to evaluate the genetic patterns, partition and diversity
with respect to habitats. Secondly to compare the tran-
scriptome of the C. islandicus with Crangonyx pseudo-
gracilis, living in surface freshwater. If unknown species
in Icelandic groundwater will be found, their phylogeny
and phylogeography will be explored.
Recent work in Snbj orn P alssons lab has shown that
C. islandicus is composed of two or more cryptic species.
Based on geographical patterns of genetic variation we
showed that the species has diverged within Iceland for
the last ve million years, and has thus survived re-
peated glaciations of Ice age in groundwater. Analysis
of the diversity points to refugias in ssures along the
tectonic plate boundary in Iceland.Applicants should have a masters degree, preferrably
with experience in bioinformatics, genomics and/or
population genetics. Good computer skills are helpful.
The position is nanced by the University of Iceland
Research Fund. The candidate will be selected based
on his or her education, research interest, former work
and two letters of recommendation.
The application, with recommendation letter, should
be sent to Snbj orn P alsson (snaebj@hi.is), before the
July 15th 2012. Further information is provided by

ParasiteCoInfections
A PhD-student position is available in a project funded
by the Academy of Finland at University of Jyv askyl a
(Department of Biological and Environmental Science),
Finland
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF CO-INFECTIONS
IN PARASITES WITH COMPLEX LIFE CYCLES
Wild hosts are typically infected with a range of par-
asite species and genotypes of one species at the same
time. This has signicant implications for parasite-
parasite interactions (one factor underlying parasite
virulence) and for host's ability to defend itself against
infections. These associations may also be subjected to
considerable variation depending on the stage of a par-
asite life cycle. This is particularly true for parasites
with complex life cycles that include several consecu-
tive hosts with dierent conditions for co-infections in
each. However, very little is currently known about
these interactions in natural host-parasite systems.
This project will explore responses of parasites and
their hosts to multiple parasite species and genotype
infections, primarily using trematodes of the genus
Diplostomum. The aims of the project are to determine
(1) the role of antagonistic and facilitative parasite in-
teractions in shaping co-infection dynamics, (2) the role
of dierent types of host responses in determining the
outcome of multiple infections, and (3) the inuence of
spatiotemporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions
on patterns of parasite community assembly. Consider-
able latitude in specic research questions will be given
to the student based on his/her personals interests.

ULeicester HumanGeneticsGIS
Funded PhD position in Geographic Information Sci-
ence (GISc) as a tool for the analysis of human genetic
and genomic data
University of Leicester, UK
Supervisors: Prof Mark A Jobling (Genetics), Dr Nick
Tate (Geography)
Background: Genetic data on human populations are
expanding exponentially through the activities of med-ical genetic consortia, individual research groups, and
thousands of private individuals purchasing genomic
predictive health testing and genetic genealogy ser-
vices. All these data share a geographical (spatial) ele-
ment: sampling locations, birthplaces of DNA donors,
or ancestral locations based on grandparental birth-
places. There are other relevant geographically re-
stricted variables, too: in complex disease epidemiol-
ogy, these are interacting environmental factors, while
for genetic ancestry, they are factors aecting popula-
tion structure, such as indicators of past migrations in
surnames, place-names, or archaeological evidence. So
far, these geographical relationships have been assessed
by a mix of ad hoc methods, with limited power to un-
derstand correlations and their explanations. There is
a need to study geographical patterns of genetic diver-
sity in a more sophisticated way, and an ideal and unex-
ploited tool exists to do this: Geographic Information
Systems (GIS), the scientic marriage of cartography,
statistical analysis, and database technology.
Aims: The project lies at the interface between Ge-
netics and Geographical Information Science (GISc)
and will provide you with a unique opportunity to be
trained in and work across these two disciplines. It
aims to: (i) Explore and develop the use of GIS to rep-
resent and analyse existing genetic datasets, including
data based on binary SNPs (single nucleotide polymor-
phisms) and multiallelic short tandem repeats; (ii) De-

genetic and non-genetic data taking into account dier-
ent levels of spatial granularity and scale; (iii) Address a
specic genetical and geographic research question that
will be dened within the rst year. The novel nature
of the project makes it inappropriate to specify the re-

an analysis of the distribution of rare variants that may
contribute to disease phenotype heritability, within the
context of other data relevant to both disease aetiology
and population structure.
Methodology: Genetic datasets that can be consid-
ered include: available Y-chromosomal data; avail-
able whole-genome SNP data from the Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium; forthcoming TwinsUK whole
genome SNP data; whole-genome SNP data from the
'People of the British Isles' project. Possible spatial
analytical tools and techniques from GISc for use with
these datasets include Kernel Density Estimation and
Geographically Weighted Regression.
Supervision and support: You will be cosuper-
vised by Prof Mark Jobling (Genetics) and Dr
Nick Tate (Geography), who have worked to-

UMontpellier CancerEvolution
PhD Thesis - Theoretical Approaches to Cancer Evo-lution
I am considering applications for a three-year PhD con-
tract, to be available starting October 1st, 2012 at the
University of Montpellier II, France.
The work will be performed in the research
group headed by Dr. Michael Hochberg (http://-
www.eec.univ-montp2.fr/people/mike-hochberg/) and
in association with Dr. Daniel Fisher (IGMM, Mont-
pellier), Dr. Jean Clairambault and Prof. Benoit
Perthame (INRIA, Paris).
Central objective: To increase our knowledge of cancer
progression and therapeutic outcomes in specic sys-
tems, using evolutionary principles. What is the level of
predictability of cancer dynamics at population and in-
dividual organism levels, given knowledge of population
ecology, and the genetic, molecular and demographic
characteristics of cells and their microenvironments?
By applying evolutionary thinking to cancer, we aim
to make discoveries that yield valuable insights on the
selection pressures that shaped cancer origins and pro-
gression, as well as relevant information to improve can-
cer therapies. We believe that answers to many ques-
tions about cancer will result from interdisciplinary ap-
proaches, and that our studies will have an immediate
impact on the scientic community. Although the idea
of cancer as an evolutionary problem is not new, histor-
ically, little attention has been focused on applications
of evolutionary biology to understand and control neo-
plastic progression and to prevent therapeutic failures.
An accurate evolutionary approach should unite and
explain, rather than replace, the insights from mecha-
nistic non-evolutionary studies.
Specic goal: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are a
new class of therapeutic targets for cancer cells, since
they are required for cell proliferation and are eciently
inhibited by specic pharmacological agents. However,
as with all chemotherapeutic agents, the development
of clinical resistance is likely. The student will inves-
tigate using a systems biology approach the evolution
of resistance to CDK inhibitors. The goal is the de-
velopment of therapeutic strategies that minimize both
tumour progression and chemoresistance. In order to
understand how resistance arises, we will rst develop a
mathematical model of the eects of CDK inhibitors on
fundamental cell parameters important in cancer: cell
proliferation, growth rates, cell cycle exit (quiescence or
senescence), migration, and cell death. Then, we will
generate CDK-inhibitor resistant cells by in vitro evolu-
tion, using prolonged treatments with escalating doses
of CDK inhibitors. Achievement of this project will
provide key insights into how cell demography and sig-
nalling change through evolution under dierent ther-July 1, 2012 EvolDir 23
apy scenarios.
Requirements: Masters 2 thesis in applied mathematics
(or postgraduate mathematical training), and demon-
strated course work in evolutionary biology or training
in evolutionary biology with mathematical emphasis.
Interested candidates need to apply by 15 June 2012
by sending (1) a letter of motivation, (2) a CV, and
(3) the names, institutions and email addresses of two

2 PhD positions in Evolutionary Ecology / Bioinfor-
matics: The Genomics of Plant Adaptation to Climatic
Conditions
What is the genetic basis of local adaptation to het-
erogeneity in environmental conditions? - This is the
main question addressed by a project on the genet-
ics/genomics of adaptation in Arabidopsis lyrata. Two
three-year graduate/PhD positions are available to join
this project, supervised by Yvonne Willi at the Insti-
tute of Biology, University of Neuchatel, Switzerland.
The causes and mechanisms of adaptation to environ-
mental change are relevant to many elds of biology,
and we will tackle them from multiple angles: as-
sembling environmental data, studying phenotypic dif-
ferences in morphological and physiological characters
within and across ( >50) populations, and linking them
to SNP frequency shifts.
The project is split into two parts: One student will
focus on within-population processes (heterogeneity in
soil-water availability, selection, gene ow), and the
other will compare populations (large scale climatic
variation, phenotypic dierences, and associated SNP
variation). The work will include analysis of partial-
genome-scan data, so a strong background in quanti-
tative thinking, statistical analysis, and bioinformatics
programming (in R or Unix) is required.
The Institute of Biology at Neuchatel consists of a
dozen groups working in diverse elds of ecology, evo-
lution, physiology, and molecular and cell biology. The
University in collaboration with the CUSO oers out-
standing PhD programs in Evolutionary Biology andGenomics. For more information, contact Yvonne Willi
(yvonne.willi@unine.ch) or see http://www2.unine.ch/-
biol/ and http://biologie.cuso.ch/accueil/
Applicants must have a university degree in the natu-
ral sciences (ideally in evolutionary biology, genetics, or
bioinformatics) that allows entrance to a PhD program,
and very good organizational, analytical, and scientic
writing skills. Motivated applicants should submit 1)
a one-page letter that summarizes interests and rele-
vant experience, 2) a CV, 3) copies of undergraduate
and masters/diploma transcripts, and 4) contact infor-
mation of two references - all as a single PDF - to:
yvonne.willi@unine.ch. Applications are welcome until
the positions are lled. Earliest evaluation of applica-
tions is on July 15, 2012.

UNeuchatel OxidativeStress
PhD Position in evolutionary ecology, University of
Neuch ~Atel.
A fully-funded 3-year PhD position is available at the
University of Neuch ~Atel, Switzerland, to work on the
causes and consequences of oxidative stress in avian se-
men. The position and research project are funded by
the Swiss National Science Foundation.
Oxidative stress is pervasive and represents a major
selective pressure throughout the animal kingdom. In
particular, vertebrate spermatozoa are very suscepti-
ble to oxidative stress, which may aect sperm perfor-
mance and male fertility. Oxidative processes are thus
hypothesised to have a profound impact on the devel-
opment of male reproductive strategies and antioxidant
allocation strategies in species where males face sperm
competition, the circumstance where sperm of two or
more males compete to fertilise the same batch of eggs.
This project will test whether antioxidant allocation
strategies underlie the development of male reproduc-
tive tactics in relation to social status as predicted by
sperm competition models. This goal will be achieved
using a combination of eld observations, eld experi-
ments and aviary experiments on house sparrows Passer
domesticus.
The ideal candidate is highly motivated and creative
with a keen interest in evolutionary questions. He/she
shows a capacity to work both independently and as a
team member and has excellent writing and communi-24 EvolDir July 1, 2012
cation skills in English. She/he has a background in
evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and/or eco-
physiology. Previous experience with bird handling, lab
work, experimental design and/or statistics is not essen-
tial but desirable. A MSc (or equivalent) in Biology is
required.
The successful applicant will be based at the Institute of
Biology, University of Neuch ~Atel. This post oers op-
portunities to collaborate and interact with researchers
working in related and complementary elds (http://-
www2.unine.ch/biol/page-7860 en.html). Our research
groups are international and our working language is
English. Knowledge of French is useful, but not es-
sential. Neuch ~Atel is an attractive city, situated by a
beautiful lake at the foot of the Jura mountains and
facing the Berner Oberland mountains. The city pro-
vides plenty of opportunities for cultural activities and
sports and oers a high quality of life. Its excellent pub-
lic transports make it easy to leave the city and head
to the mountains for outdoor activities such as hiking,
climbing or skiing.
Starting date: October 1, 2012.
Application requirements: Applications should include
1) a 1-2 page cover letter outlining motivations, re-
search interests and relevant experience, 2) a CV with
list of publications (if any), 3) copies of academic quali ,
4) the contact details of two academic referees, and 5) a
1-page description of your MSc project. Send the above

UPorto GenomeEvolution
PhD Students Proposals Selection of candidates for aPhD grant proposal to submit to the Portuguese Foun-
dation for Science and Technology
We accept applicants for a PhD grant proposal to be
submitted to the Portuguese Foundation for the Science
and Technology under the following topics:
1. \A genome-wide sequencing study to character-
ize genes responsible for the development, sensory and
adaptation in Vertebrates". Major phenotypic changes
in vertebrates (from mammals to sh), occurred by
the evolution of various gene products over the last
half billion years. Understanding the genetic basis of
the diversication of development and sensory genes in
vertebrates can provide fundamental biological insight
about species evolution, ecological tness, and genetic
diseases.
2. \A molecular genomic approach to unravel the evo-
lution of natural toxins". Gene families, which encode
toxins, are found in many marine animals (from deadly
poisoning jellyshes to sea snakes), yet there is lim-
ited understanding of their evolution at the nucleotide
level and the evolutionary signicance of their protein
mutations. Understanding the evolution of ecological
specialization is important for making inferences about
the origins of natural toxins biodiversity.
3. \Genomics and global phylogeny of cyanobacteria
species". It is much debated whether microorganisms
are easily dispersed globally or whether they, like many
macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies. Re-
cent ndings using faster evolving genetic markers in
protozoa species revealed considerable genetic structure
and suggested that protest biodiversity may be signi-
cantly higher than previously thought.
Other hot research topics in genomics, molecular evolu-
tion and bioinformatics can be considered deepening on
the student motivation and ongoing research projects in
our lab.
The granted candidates will have a monthly salary of
980 euros and will develop their work at CIIMAR, Uni-
versity of Porto, Portugal (http://www.ciimar.up.pt/).
The candidates should have a B.S. or Graduation in Bi-
ology, Biochemistry or other related elds with a com-
petitive score (16 or more out of 20 plus a Master degree
with 16 or more out of 20) and should have a strong
interest in developing research in Molecular Evolution,
Genomics and Bioinformatics. Students with published
papers in ISI journals will be given priority.
The candidates should include: - Detailed curriculum
vitae; - Scanned copy of the Graduation title and Mas-
ter title if applicable).
Candidates need to be European (EU) citizens or hav-26 EvolDir July 1, 2012

PhD-student position in Molecular Evolution with spe-

at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology Apply
no later than 2012-06-29
Starting date: September 1, 2012.
We study the molecular evolution of genomes from in-
fectious disease causing bacteria as well as symbiotic
and free-living bacteria using bioinformatic analyses of
next-generation sequencing data (NGS). The knowl-
edge is important to understand the early evolution of
life as well as the mechanisms and selective forces that
drive adaptations to dierent environments. Metage-
nomics is a new area of research in which all DNA
present in a particular environment is sequenced and
analyzed. With the aid of metagenomics it is possi-
ble to identify and study previously unknown microor-
ganisms that have not been cultivated in the labora-
tory. Another new exciting technology is single cell ge-
nomics, which enables the genomes of single cells to be
sequenced. By combining metagenomics and single cell
genomics, it is possible to perform an in-depth investi-
gation of the microora, in a way that was not possible
with conventional technologies.
The overall aim of this project is to study how bacterial

Position in Theoretical Population Genetics at the Uni-
versity of Vienna
The mathematics and biosciences group (MaBS, home-
page www.mabs.at) led by Joachim Hermisson at the
University of Vienna is looking for a strong and highly
motivated candidate for a PhD position in evolutionary
modeling and statistical data analysis.
Project: * Genetics of Hybrid Zones and Introgression
*
Hybrid zones are a fascinating study object from a pop-
ulation genetics perspective since they provide us prime
examples of \evolution in action". As the two \species"
that meet at a hybrid zone are not yet fully separated,
several questions arise: Is a narrow hybrid zone is a
natural rst step towards full speciation? If so, how
do the barriers to gene-ow build up along the chromo-
some? And how long does this take? Is there a lasting
potential for adaptive gene-ow through these barriers
{ and could adaptive gene-ow inhibit speciation? Fi-
nally, can we detect \footprints" of these processes in
DNA sequence variation?
In this project, we address these questions with a com-
bination of analytical and statistical modeling, and ap-
plication of these models to next-generation DNA poly-
morphism data. The core work of the Vienna PhD stu-
dent will be the development of models and methods.
The project is a collaboration with the Natural History
Museum London. At the NHM, data from about 400
populations from a bluebell hybrid zone across Spain
has been collected. The analysis of these data will be a
joint endeavor. To this end, a six-month placement of
the PhD student in London is part of the project.
INTERCROSSING: We are an EU funded excellence
program for early career training and research. Fur-
ther information can be found here:

ronment: Vienna is not only one of the world's most
liveable cities, but also oers an excellent research
environment and is currently developing into one of
the main centers in evolutionary research in Europe.
The position will be located at the Max F. Perutz
Laboratories, part of the Vienna Biocenter Campus,
which houses a vibrant community of researchers
from several institutes. As a member of the MaBS
group, the student will also interact with Magnus
Nordborg and members of his group, and will be
part of a larger community of evolutionary biologists
and population geneticists through the activities of
the Vienna Graduate School for Population Genet-
ics (http://www.popgen-vienna.at) and EvolVienna(www.evolVienna.at).
Conditions: The position is for three years, salary is ac-
cording to the (very generous) EU rates. The starting

answers
I want thank you all persons who kindly sent their sug-

have got. They are listed anonymously.
If someone want receiving the email address for a given
report, please, write me at
fbarbanera@biologia.unipi.it
|{
1. I have used three dierent approaches to estimate
ancestral area reconstruction. One is S-Diva (statisti-
cal dispersal vicariance) of Yu et al. (2010) (http:/-
/mnh.scu.edu.cn/S-diva/blog/index.html), which I be-
lieve has been superseded by RASP. I used the online
version of S-DIVA and it was quite easy to run. You
can check my paper Morales-Hojas et al. (2011) Mol.
Phyl. Evol. 60. This method allows for phylogenetic
uncertainty and can be run with trees from the poste-
rior trees from a MrBayes analysis, and it gives you the
probabilities for each ancestral area. The output gives
you a tree with the probabilities in each node. I havealso used Mesquite to estimate ancestral area with Like-
lihood. Mesquite is easy to use once you get the hang
of it, and the method it uses gives you the probabilities
of each state in the node of the phylogeny. And nally
you have SIMMAP (http://www.simmap.com/). It es-
timates the posterior probabilities of character states
for each internal node. It has the advantage that it uses
a Bayesian approach and allows for uncertainty (you
can run it with your posterior trees from MrBayes),
but the output is not very user friendly. Nevertheless
is not dicult to run and it is quite robust.
2. A good program to do that is MESQUITE. The pro-
gram can perform this through ML o parsimony anal-
ysis. I hope that this information is usefull for you
3. Not sure if you could call these friendly but we have
used 3area and Lagrange. Good luck,
4. http://code.google.com/p/lagrange/ 5. One quick
suggestion would be the software PhyloMapper: http:/-

DAMBE workshop Jul6-11
Dear Colleagues,
I will oer a DAMBE Phylogenetics Workshop at Uni-
versity of Ottawa on July 6 and July 11, 2012 (at the
beginning and ending of Evolution 2012). The work-
shop is not part of the meeting and everyone is welcome
(up to the capacity of the computer room reserved).
1. I have booked a computer room (Cube 104) between
8:30 am and 4:30 pm on Jul. 6 and Jul. 11. Cube is
a small building that has the shape of cube, and it is
labelled as Cube in the Google map at the following
link
http://maps.google.com/maps/place?ftid=-

mjbfT-PfM-aiwAGMtf2LDg 2. The workshops will
start at 9 am, with a lunch break between 12 noon and44 EvolDir July 1, 2012
1:30 pm, and resume at 1:30 pm. I will be with you
during the morning and afternoon sessions.
3. The workshop will include DAMBE function demon-
strations, presentation of essential but minimal theoret-
ical background, and hands-on practices, all done in an
informal and interactive manner. The topics will be as
originally announced, i.e.,
-routine phylogenetic analyses and dating methods
(both the conventional dating with internal node cal-
ibration and tip-dating which is used mainly for viral
sequences sampled over dierent years)
-phylogeny-based comparative methods.
-evolutionary genomics
4. The workshop is free, but with the associated evils of
no coee, no cookies and no lunch. There is a drinking
water fountain outside the computer room.
5. DAMBE is a comprehensive software package for
molecular biology and evolution. It is freely available
from my web site at: http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/-
dambe.asp The computer room has 27 seats. Cur-
rently 14 people have expressed interest in participat-
ing, so more participants can be accommodated. If you
have colleagues who might want to attend the work-
shop, please let me know. Please also keep me informed
of your change of plan. Thanks.

Drosophila dates
In October 2011 I asked the following two questions
(original email follows below) with the request that peo-
ple do so without reference to the literature.
[1] When was the most recent common ancestor of D.
melanogaster and D. simulans? and [2] When was
the most recent common ancestor of the subgenera
Sophophora and Drosophila
I have tried in several ways to incorporate all the es-
timates and their uncertainty - Here is my best go at
headline values:* D.melanogaster-D.simulans * Range of point esti-
mates: 1-7 Mya Total 95% density of estimates, ac-
counting for their condence intervals: 0-9 Mya
* Sophophora-Drosophila * Range of point estimates:
7-100 Mya Total 95% density of estimates, accounting
for their condence intervals: 5-110 Mya
I have tried to capture the reported uncertainty is this
gure: http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/groups/-
obbard/Data/Drosophila Date survey.pdf.
For comparison, the estimates given in Tamura et al
(2004)MBEv21 are 5.4[3.2-7.5]Mya and 63[39-87]Mya
respectively, and the estimates given by Russo et al
(1995)MBEv12 are 2.3[1-3.6]Mya and 40[33-46]Mya
(95% bounds assuming normally distributed uncer-
tainty).
My original objective was to establish the gures (if
any) that the Drosophila community carry around in
their heads, and the survey was motivated by the
widespread use of dates that dier by nearly a factor
of two (e.g. in back-to-back papers) but elicit no com-
ment.
I received approximately 70 responses, around 40 of
which provided either ranges or point estimates for both
dates (some points included condence intervals, as re-
quested). I excluded responses from which I couldn't
glean bounds or points, e.g: \a) A long time ago and
b) Longer than a)."
Papers/books that were mentioned specically by re-
spondents were:
Moriyama, E.N., and J. R. Powell. 1997. Synonymous
substitution rates in Drosophila: mitochondrial versus
nuclear genes. J. Mol. Evol. 45(4):378-391.
Tamura, K., S. Subramanian, and S. Kumar. 2004.
Temporal patterns of fruit y (Drosophila) evolution
revealed by mutation clocks. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21:36-
44. (mentioned twice)
Jerey R. Powell (1997) \Progress and Prospects in
Evolutionary Biology: The Drosophila Model" Oxford
University Press, 4 Sep 1997 - 562 pages
A special prize goes to the person who responded \for
question (1) 3.5 Ne generations where Ne is the eective
population size of mel, or equivalently 1.5 Ne genera-
tions where Ne is the eective population size of sim."
but when asked to convert to years suggested \Ok, 20
thousand years ago." This answer was excluded.
A big thank you to all who took part!

*Without* looking at the literature, please at-
tempt to answer the following questions: [1] When
was the most recent common ancestor of Drosophila
melanogaster and Drosophila simulans? [2] When was
the most recent common ancestor of the subgenera
Sophophora and Drosophila (from example, the MRCA
of D.melanogaster and either D. virilis or D. mojaven-
sis. This is the date at the root of the 12-genomes
phylogeny).
My aim is to survey the community's opinion (including
any errors or misapprehensions), not to directly survey
the literature. So PLEASE answer questions [1] and [2]
without looking them up rst. If you wish, you can also
name any paper that you might have in mind when you
give your answer - but again PLEASE DO NOT look
at that paper to check your answer. All answers will
be treated anonymously, and the results published here
in due course. If you distrust point estimates (as you
should) please give condence intervals. These could
be a point estimate plus-or-minus a standard error, or
a point estimate with 95% condence intervals, or a at
stepped distribution of your choice (for example, \any-
where between X and Y million years ago"). I am also
happy to take a multi-spiked distribution (\either X or
Y million years ago"), including one with a zero-bound
(\less than Z million years ago") or any specic distri-
bution of your choice (e.g. paste in the R-code). If you
have absolutely no informed opinion, but you have per-
sisted in reading this far anyway, you are clearly the sort
of person whose wild guess I would like to hear about.
Please just take a guess (with any error distribution
you feel is appropriate) and just let me know that it is
an uninformed guess. Thank you for taking the time to
read this email, and I look forward to hearing any and
all (un)informed guesses.

sults, and also oers two important new features: infer-
ence of population splitting, and accomodation of SNP
data derived via a panel.
Previous versions of LAMARC contained a a very se-
rious bug in inference of migration rates. Inference of
each migration rate was, due to this bug, a composite of48 EvolDir July 1, 2012
information about the rate from A to B and information
about the rate from B to A. This led to numerically in-
correct results and in some but not all cases to reversing
the apparent direction of asymmetrical migration. All
LAMARC migration results must be considered suspect
and should be rerun.
We deeply regret this error and apologize to those
whose research it has aected.
We have also corrected a bug in inference of growth
rates which could cause spurious peaks and condence
or support interval boundaries in cases where negative
growth was considered. While most results which in-
ferred strongly positive growth would be unaected by
this bug, results involving negative growth may have
been aected, as may condence interval boundaries
extending into negative growth.
Version 2.1.8, besides xing these bugs, introduces two
new features.
First, LAMARC can now infer the time of population
splitting for scenarios where populations have diverged
from a common ancestor as well as the post-split migra-
tion rates. Scenarios with multiple populations are pos-
sible if the branching tree of populations is presumed
to be known.
Second, LAMARC now oers a correction for use of
SNP data derived using a panel-based SNP chip. Un-
corrected use of panel-derived data will understate
Theta due to loss of rare SNPs which were missed in
the panel. The correction leads to nearly unbiased in-
ference from panel-based data.
LAMARC's speed in likelihood-based runs has also
been improved signicantly.

Software MOL COANCDear Evoldir members,
A new release (3.0) of MOL COANC is already
available to download from the web page http://-
dl.dropbox.com/u/5714008/Fernandez.htm .
This programme is intended to estimate the genealog-
ical coancestry between a group of contemporaneous
individuals (i.e. none of them can be ancestor of other
individual in the same set) from the genotype for a num-
ber of codominant markers, following the approach pre-
sented in Fern andez & Toro (Molecular Ecology 2006).
The underlying idea is constructing a pedigree by cre-
ating virtual' ancestors of the target (genotyped) in-
dividuals which maximises the correlation between the
molecular coancestry matrix calculated from markers
and the genealogical coancestry obtained for that par-
ticular pedigree. As stated in the original paper, this
method has several advantages over other coancestry
estimators: i) as the method implies explicit reconstruc-
tion of a genealogy, it always yields congruent coances-
try matrices (in opposition with pairwise methods); ii)
it needs no assumptions about the allelic frequencies
of the used markers and no previous knowledge of the
population structure (e.g. only FS families exist); iii)
it allows for complex relationships between individuals
as it is able to construct deeper' genealogies.
- Main novelty of this release is the possibility of deal-
ing with hermaphroditic and monoecious species. Con-
sequently, we can force the software to create ancestors
with separate sexes (i.e. they permanently act as males
or females, as in previous versions) or allow for any
kind of mating design, assuming they can act as males
or females each time they mate.
- In the case of non separated sexes it is also possible to
allow or not for selngs, depending on the physiology
of the species.
- Now the maximum number of ancestors per genera-
tion has not to be constant but can be dene separately.
This way the previous information on the demographic
history of the population can be accounted for (e.g.
number of founders, known bottlenecks or expansions)
and more accurate solutions can be found. Notice that
a larger number of possible ancestors will (unnecessar-
ily) enlarge the space of feasible solutions reducing the
eciency of the optimisation algorithm.
- It is possible to establish a predened coancestry ma-
trix between founders. This feature permits to account
for a real knowledge of the origin of the oldest known
ancestors or to compare dierent hypothesis about the
foundation of the population (i.e. from related or un-
related individuals).

Software Positive selection
Dear all,
as you may know, due to the confounding eect of de-
mography, it is extremely dicult to detect recent posi-
tive Darwinian selection reliably in a natural or domes-
tic population. Recently, we proposed a novel method.
This method has been mathematically proved that the
demographic factors, including population size expan-
sion and bottleneck, do not aect the test.
Notably, it's a single-locus based approach. That
means, to detect positive selection reliably, all you need
is just a short piece of nuclear DNA, say several hundred
base pairs. The sample size should be >= 21 (diploid)
individuals.
The logic behind the method is: the confounding eect
of varying population size can be completely removed
if we only examine tree topology. Then two very sim-
ple sampling strategies remove the confounding eect
of hidden population structure. Those two sampling
strategies are:
1) The minimum sample size from each sampling loca-
tion should be at least 2 or 3, calculated as alph * (n
- 1) / 2. Alpha is the signicance level, n the sample
size.
2) Assuming your sampling locations do not cover the
whole species distribution area, and these uncovered
areas are separated into several isolated regions due
to natural barriers. Then try to collect one individ-
ual/chromosome from each isolated (and uncovered)
regions. Those individuals will be used as migrant de-
tectors. Usually, 2 or 5 migrant detectors should be
enough.
The method has been described in: Haipeng Li (2011).

Woody plantsWhat percentage of plant species are woody?
Woody versus herbaceous is one of the major axes of
life history variation in plants. We sought to nd the
answer to the seemingly simple question: what percent-
age of plant species in the world are woody? We asked
a small group of botanists this question and got an ex-
traordinarily wide variety of answers. In addition to
tallying up the species numbers, we (here \we" refers
to myself along with Rich Fitzjohn, Amy Zanne, Will
Cornwell and others involved with our NESCent work-
ing group: \Tempo and Mode of Plant Trait Evolu-
tion") thought it would be interesting to survey biology-
types to see if a general consensus answer exists. Please
take a couple of seconds to ll out our questionnaire.
Thanks! Answer coming out soon in a journal near you.

EvolAsexualReproductionPostdoc: Evolutionary genomics of asexual reproduc-
tion (Edinburgh, UK)
Two postdoctoral research associate positions are avail-
able to work on our project 'The evolutionary ge-
nomics of sexual recombination'. This is a large, 3-
year, NERC-funded project based in the Universities
of Edinburgh and Hull, UK. Using modern evolution-
ary comparative genomics approaches we aim to study
the rate and pattern of genome sequence change with
and without the action of meiosis, and across dierent
levels of inbreeding. The project will be carried out in
a phylogenetic design, on a newly generated nematode
multi-genome data set, leading to advances in under-
standing the role of reproductive mode in shaping the
structure and diversity of genomes. This advert refers
to the rst of the two postdoctoral posts, based in Ed-
inburgh, UK.
The puzzling predominance of sexual reproduction
amongst animals has been repeatedly identied as one
of the major outstanding questions in biology and has
received an enormous amount of study. Meiotic recom-
bination is one of the fundamental forces of evolution
and plays a very signicant role in both generating and
mixing the genetic diversity present in sexual organ-
isms. Recombination is also suggested to be instru-
mental in shaping the content of eukaryotic genomes.
We are embarking on a three year project to study the
role of breeding system and recombination in shaping
the content and diversity of animal genomes using an
exceptionally powerful natural system - the Root Knot
Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). We will, for the rst
time, be able to take a comparative genomic view of
radically dierent reproductive modes in a phylogenetic
design. Together these studies will give us a novel and
powerful understanding of the role sexual reproduction
plays in shaping genome cont ent.
The goals of the project are to generate complete, an-
notated genome sequences for a set of Meloidogyne
species (at least 16 genomes), carefully chosen to rep-
resent independent evolutionary contrasts in reproduc-
tive mode, and then to use these whole genome data
to characterise the eect of organismal breeding sys-
tem on abundance, diversity and distribution of trans-
posable elements between amphimicts, automicts, and
apomicts. We will also test for adaptive evolution of
genes and gene families using statistical birth and death
model of gene family evolution, and test sequence based
signatures of adaptive evolution and relate these to loci
involved in either reproduction or plant-parasite inter-
actions.

in a large-scale analysis of loss-of-function variants inhuman protein-coding genes, as part of a new transla-
tional genomics group (http://www.macarthurlab.org)
jointly based at Massachusetts General Hospital and
the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. This position
will involve developing tools for functional annotation
of genetic variation data from over 20,000 sequenced
exomes, as well as working with RNA sequencing data
from multiple projects.
Applications for both postdoctoral training positions
or sta scientist roles are welcome. The details
of the position are below - please email me at
macarthur@atgu.mgh.harvard.edu with a CV and cover
letter if you're interested.
Best wishes,
Daniel MacArthur
*About the position* The MacArthur lab <https:/-
/sites.google.com/site/dgmacarthur/ >is a new re-
search team based within the Analytic and Transla-
tional Genetics Unit <http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/-
>(ATGU) at Massachusetts General Hospital and
closely aliated with the Broad Institute of Har-
vard and MIT. The successful candidate will be-
come a part of the Broad Institute community, in-
teracting extensively with other members of the Pro-
gram in Medical and Population Genetics <http://-
www.broadinstitute.org/mpg >. You will work with
population geneticists, clinicians, statisticians, compu-
tational biologists, industry partners and others in a
unique and collaborative intellectual environment, and
have access to new informatic and experimental tech-
nologies being developed in the world's leading center
for human genomics.
We are looking for an ambitious, intellectually curious
individual who is comfortable with integrating large,
complex data-sets, and excited about the future of ge-
nomic medicine. Applicants do not necessarily have a
formal background in academic research - a PhD is not
required for applicants for the bioinformatics special-
ist position - but should be prepared to apply rigorous
computational approaches to complex biological prob-
lems, and enthusiastic about communicating their work
to both scientic and lay audiences.
*Principal duties and responsibilities* This role will fo-
cus on exploring the impact of natural loss-of-function
(LoF) mutations in human protein-coding genes. Our
group has recently published an article in the jour-
nal *Science* <http://www.sciencemag.org/content/-
335/6070/823.full >on the systematic identication of
LoF variants from next-generation sequencing data <
https://sites.google.com/site/dgmacarthur/lof >. You
will work with ATGU members and other collaboratorsJuly 1, 2012 EvolDir 55
in developing an informatic pipeline for the identica-
tion and ltering of LoF variants from genome and ex-
ome sequencing data. This position will involve using
data from large-scale RNA sequencing experiments and
databases of known disease mutations to rene proba-
bilistic models of the functional impact of genetic vari-
ants. You will coordinate the application of the com-
pleted analysis pipeline to exome sequencing data from
over 20,000 individuals.
Ultimately, we aim to perform large-scale genotyping
of LoF variants to identify the eects of these genetic
changes on human traits and disease risk - an approach
we have dubbed the Human Knockout Project. You
will have a chance to be involved in the design and ex-
ecution of this ambitious project, which we anticipate
will uncover the function of many currently uncharac-
terized human genes. You will also contribute to the de-
velopment of an integrated pipeline for the annotation
of clinical sequencing data currently being generated
by the ATGU and collaborators, and to the applica-
tion of this pipeline to sequencing data from hundreds
of Mendelian disease patients to discover novel disease-
causing mutations.
The candidate will be expected to contribute to the
writing of high-impact scientic publications and fund-
ing applications, to travel to and present their work at
international conferences, and to actively seek collabo-
rations with other researchers around the world. This
position may also involve some supervision of graduate
students and research technicians.
*Skills required*
- A good working knowledge of biology and human ge-
nomics; - Direct experience with large-scale data from
genotyping and next-generation sequencing technolo-
gies, including familiarity with analysis tools such as
SAMtools and GATK; - Ability to work in a unix en-
vironment, with demonstrable experience in high-level
programming using C/C++ and experience with script-
ing languages such as Perl or Python;

LMU Munich EvolutionaryGeneticsPostdoc position in Plant Evolutionary Genetics at
LMU Munich (Germany)
A postdoctoral position is open for (up to) three years
in the Biology Department at the University of Mu-
nich LMU for someone interested by molecular evo-
lution and population genetics in plants (wild tomato
species). The applicant will be based in the Section of
Evolutionary Biology in the group of Prof. Wolfgang
Stephan. The applicant will pursue research on molec-
ular adaptation of wild tomato species to abiotic stress
such as drought tolerance or cold resistance. These
species are found in a wide range of habitats (high
mountains, deserts) in South America, and are thus a
good model to study plant adaptation at the genome
level. The objective of the postdoctoral period is to use
high-throughput sequencing to detect natural selection
involved in adaptation to dierent habitats. The appli-
cant is also expected to perform functional validation at
candidate genes. The project involves thus molecular
and quantitative genetic assays of wild tomato acces-
sions, and inferences from molecular population genet-
ics and evolution.
Applicants must have completed their PhD before
starting the position. We seek highly motivated can-
didates with a strong record of accomplishment from
their Master/PhD thesis work. Ideally, applicants
should have some experience with molecular genetic
techniques, and a strong background in population ge-
netics, evolution and statistics.

MaastrichtU EvolutionTropicalTrees
Research in the natural sciences is changing rapidly.
With the recent advent of massive parallel (next gen-
eration) sequencing, gigabytes of data per day are gen-
erated. However, the use of these data in certain ar-
eas of plant biology (e.g. systematics and phylogenet-
ics) is still fairly limited and its possibilities are under-
investigated for non-model organisms.
We are looking for a post doctoral fellow to join the
Maastricht Science Programme at the faculty of Hu-
manities and Sciences of Maastricht University. The
position will focus on next-generation sequencing of
plant (plastid) genomes as a basis for research on tropi-
cal tree diversity in the South American Amazon. Plas-
tid genomes of c. 150 species of tropical trees will be
generated and their evolution studied. Also this ge-
nomic data set has to be mined to explore its additional
potential. Furthermore, the successful applicant should
contribute to the sequencing and analyses of transcrip-
tomes of tropical trees as part of a newly emerging sys-
tems biology research theme at Maastricht University.
Requirements
The ideal candidate is a highly motivated postdoctoral
fellow and has experience with (dierent) next genera-tion platforms and high throughput variation analysis.
The candidate should hold a PhD in (plant) molecu-
lar biology or related elds, and have a strong pub-
lication record. A strong bioinformatics background
and experience in working with large datasets (such as
next-generation sequencing) is a rm requirement. Also
prior wet lab experience and experience with DNA ex-
traction and sequencing from dicult templates is re-
quired. Conditions of employment
The terms of employment of MaastrichtUniversityare
set out in the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch
Universities (CAO). Furthermore, local UM provisions
also apply. For more information look at the website

Montpellier EvolutionAgressiveness
An 18-months post-doctoral position is available in
Montpellier, France, from Septembre 2012. The pro-
posed research will be conducted as part of the BIOFIS
project (Pest and invasive species: from individual to
population and species) granted by Agropolis Founda-
tion. Using several tools including experimental ap-
proaches, this project aims at disentangling *key ques-
tion regarding invasive success*: role of *admixture
events* and of *genetic bottlenecks*, *evolution of
particular traits during spatial expansions*. In our
team, the post-doctoral researcher will address these
questions on two *fungal species responsible for major
emerging diseases of plants*: /Magnaporthe oryzae/
and /Mycosphaerella jiensis/ attacking rice and ba-
nana, respectively. On */Magnaporthe oryzae/*, using
*experimental evolution*, the post-doctoral researcher
will study the*role of initial genetic variability of the in-
oculum* on the invasive success on resistant hosts, and
will seek for aggressiveness traits having evolved dur-
ing invasion. On */Mycosphaerella jiensis/*, he/she
will contribute to study the *evolution of aggressiveness
traits in natural population during a spatial expansion*
from one hand, and *during an admixture event* on the
other hand.
The applicant will join the BecPhy group (Evolutionary
Biology of Phytopathogenic Fungi) of the BGPI Re-
search Unit (Biology and Genetics of Plant-Pathogen
Interactions). To evaluate emergence risks and dene
new and durable control strategies, our group aims
at *understanding how populations of phytopathogenic
fungi adapt*. Using theoretical and experimental stud-
ies in epidemiology and evolutionary biology, we ad-
dress the origin of emerging fungal diseases, the impor-
tance of the dierent evolutionary forces in the adap-
tive process, the genetic constraints on traits involved
in adaptation, and the epidemiological and adaptive dy-
namics in fungal populations in agrosystems.
Applicants must hold a PhD and have a strong back-
ground in evolutionary biology. An expertise in ex-
perimental evolution and in the study of evolution of
adaptive traits is required.

Job description
In many organisms individuals dier systematically in
their dispersal behaviour. Moreover, individual vari-
ation in dispersal is correlated with other traits, in-
cluding metabolism, activity, aggressiveness, boldness,
sociability, behavioural exibility and learning ability.
Although such correlation structures (\dispersal syn-
dromes") have been described for many species, nei-
ther their evolutionary emergence nor their ecological,
evolutionary and genetic consequences are well under-
stood. By means of a theoretical approach (using an-
alytical models and individual-based computer simula-
tions) the project will address questions such as: Why
are the dispersal syndromes in dierent species remark-
ably similar in some respects and remarkably dierent
in others? What are the consequences of variation in
dispersal for social evolution (e.g., cooperative breed-
ing) and the mating system? What are the implications
of non-equilibrium dynamics for the genetic structure
of a population and for the estimation of pedigrees, re-
latedness and tness?
The project is designed as a 4-year PhD project; how-
ever, we also welcome applications from exceptional
postdoctoral researchers for a 3-year position. The close
collaboration between theoretical and behavioural re-
searchers, along with access to the long-term Seychelles
warbler dataset, provides a unique opportunity to forge
a link between conceptual models and real-world data.

(desired for a PhD candidate; essential for a post-
doc) - working knowledge of programmes like C++,
Maple/Mathematica/Matlab or R; excellent program-
ming skills (desired for a PhD candidate; essential for a
postdoc) - excellent academic record (as shown by a list
of examination marks); proven ability to plan and pri-
oritize work and to work to and meet deadlines; strong66 EvolDir July 1, 2012
commitment to excellence in research and teaching -
ability to develop creative approaches to problem solv-

3yr Post-doc 'Resource availability and the evolution of
host resistance to parasites'
http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/AEQ066/associate-
research-fellow-or-research-fell ow/
The College of Life and Environmental Sciences wishes
to recruit an Associate Research Fellow or Research
Fellow to work with Professor Mike Boots on a new
research project that is funded by a NERC respon-
sive mode grant. This NERC funded post is avail-
able from September 2012 for duration of three years.
The successful applicant will be the key researcher on a
proposal entitled \Resource availability and the evolu-
tion of host resistance to parasites: within individuals,
trade-o shapes and the genetic basis of resistance." All
organisms are subject to infection and have to invest
resources into mechanisms that either prevent infection
or that clear infections that enter the body. However,
the availability of resources in the wild is nite and
diers across environments. This is important because
parasites are critical to natural, agricultural and human
populations and an understanding of the expression and
evolution of host defence is crucial to the management
of infectious disease in both natural and managed sys-
tems. The project will take an experimental approach
to examine the role that resource availability plays: (1)
in individual immune responses; (2) in shaping the ge-
netic variability and trade-o relationships; and (3) in
constraining the evolution of resistance. The project
will examine the evolution of resistance to parasites us-
ing the Indian meal moth and its granulosis virus as
a model system, where we have demonstrated ability
to control both resource availability and pathogen in-
fection. The moth will be genome sequenced and a
combination of resequencing, gene-expression and new
quantitative techniques will be used to examine funda-
mental questions on the shape of trade-o relationships.
The successful candidate will be based Biosciences in
Falmouth, Cornwall but collaborate researchers based
in Liverpool and Oxford. The successful applicant will
be able to present information on research progress and
outcomes, communicate complex information, orally,
in writing and electronically. Applicants will have a
PhD in evolutionary biology and be able to demon-
strate sucient knowledge in host-parasite interactions
and/or the analysis of sequence and expression data
or quantitative genetics. Applicants must be able to
work independently, organise time and manage tech-
nicians. For further information please contact Pro-

You are invited to apply for the post of Research Fel-
low to work closely with Dr Richard Edwards on a
BBSRC-funded project to develop and apply compu-
tational tools for the prediction of protein motifs that
mediate protein-protein interactions.
Many protein-protein interactions are mediated by
Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs): short stretches of pro-
teins (5-15 amino acids long), of which only a few posi-
tions are critical to function. These motifs are vital for
biological processes of fundamental importance, such as
signalling pathways and targeting proteins to the cor-
rect part of a cell.
This position represents an exciting opportunity to join
one of the early pioneers in the growing eld of SLiM
prediction. The primary objective of this project is to
integrate a number of leading computational techniques
to predict novel SLiMs and, in so doing, add crucial de-
tail to protein-protein interaction networks. This will
generate a valuable resource of potential SLiMs, includ-
ing dened occurrences and interactions.
The project will use a number of computational and se-
quence analysis techniques. Basic programming skills
are essential. Experience with database design, HPC
and web programming are desirable. You will be
required to develop a thorough knowledge of SLiM-
mediated protein-protein interactions and should there-fore be comfortable with biological literature, biochem-
istry, molecular evolution and structural biology.
A background in either computer science or biology,
with a PhD in a relevant subject area, is essential.
Previous research experience (PhD or Postdoctoral)
in computational biology is highly desirable. Candi-
dates with a computer science background must demon-
strate an interest and aptitude for molecular biology.
Similarly, candidates with a biology background must
demonstrate an interest and aptitude for computer pro-
gramming.
You should be an enthusiastic researcher, a good team-
worker and an excellent communicator. Project man-
agement skills and independent research experience are
desirable.
For informal enquiries, contact Richard Edwards,
email: R.Edwards@soton.ac.uk. More information
about the lab and on-going research can be found at:

Please apply online through www.jobs.soton.ac.uk or
alternatively telephone 023 8059 2750 for an applica-
tion form. Please quote reference number 119512BJ on
all correspondence. In addition to submitting your CV,

UToronto EvolutionPlantPhenols
Post-doc position in chemical ecology of polyphenols in
the Salminen lab: \Evolution and global distribution of
plant polyphenol-based pro-oxidant defenses"
Polyphenols are a group of specialized metabolites that
are produced by practically all global plant species.
One of the most important polyphenol functions is their
ability to serve as plants' chemical defense against e.g.herbivorous insects. However, the true mechanisms re-
sponsible for the polyphenol activities have been a tar-
get of ongoing debate. One of the most apparent types
of defense mechanisms - polyphenol oxidation triggered
by either high gut pH or plant oxidase enzymes - has
received only a little attention. Thus we have a gap in
our knowledge of (1) what are the active (or inactive)
pro-oxidant polyphenols, (2) how are the pro-oxidant
polyphenols (and pro-oxidant activity) distributed in
the plant kingdom, and (3) how are the pro-oxidant
polyphenol molecules and pro-oxidant activity evolved
in ecologically relevant families and genus.
Position The post-doc will be part of the Natural Chem-
istry Research Group working in the Salminen lab (Lab-
oratory of Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology,
University of Turku, Finland). The lab is equipped with
the latest high-quality instruments needed for the mod-
ern studies of chemical ecology. Recently, the Salminen
lab has created a UPLC-MS/MS based method that is
able to (1) reveal all the polyphenol classes, (2) quan-
tify the individual polyphenols and (3) reveal and quan-
tify the individual pro-oxidant polyphenols (active and
inactive ones) present in any plant species or sample.
This method is currently being used to reveal the in-
dividual pro-oxidant polyphenols present in more than
1500 plant species that have been collected around the
globe and distributed along the plant tree of life. A spe-
cial emphasis is given for ecologically relevant species of
Oenothera, Quercus and Eucalypts, to reveal both the
micro- and macroevolution of polyphenol-based pro-
oxidant defences in plants. The post-doc will join this
exciting and challenging task, and will coordinate the
data production and handling. The project will involve
interdisciplinary collaborations with leadings scientists
from around the globe and the post-doc may visit their
labs either in Cornell University (New York, USA), Uni-
versity of Toronto (Toronto, Canada) or Australian Na-
tional University (Canberra, Australia). He/she will
be able to boost his/her career by writing many high-
quality papers related to e.g. (1) the polyphenol oxida-
tion hypothesis, (2) the micro- and macroevolution of
polyphenol-based pro-oxidant defences, (3) the latitudi-
nal herbivore defence hypothesis, and (4) methodology
related to these advanced chemical ecology techniques.
Requirements We are seeking a highly motivated, team-
oriented post-doc with a strong interest in chemical
ecology, chemistry and plant-herbivore interactions.
Applicants should hold a PhD (chemistry, chemical
ecology or equivalent) and must have a proven expe-
rience in the eld of chemical ecology, both in the lab
work and writing of scientic papers. Experience with
chemical methods such as LC, LC-MS, 96-well plate
reader and/or any other methods related to polyphe-74 EvolDir July 1, 2012
nol chemistry would be highly benecial. Knowledge
of statistical methods and the ability to handle large
data sets will be benecial as well. Good knowledge of
spoken and written English is required.
Conditions The position will start in September 2012
at the earliest. The position will be for a maximum of
four years, but could be lled for a shorter period, if
needed. The salary is xed according to the guidelines
of the University of Turku for teaching and research
personnel at the level 4-6. The mobility of a foreign
post-doc may be enhanced by an additional mobility
grant.

*Description*
This intensive one-week course will introduce strategies
for applying core principles of evolutionary biology toproblems in medicine and public health, with a special
focus on infection and cancer. The course will not at-
tempt to cover all possible applications, it will focus
on a few examples. Some especially relevant principles
include life history theory, host pathogen co-evolution,
the regulation of defenses, developmental plasticity, and
trade-os shaping reproductive strategies. These prin-
ciples will be applied to clinically relevant topics includ-
ing aging, antibiotic resistance, clinical management
of fever, endothelial disease, prenatal experience and
metabolic syndrome, and reproductive cancers. This
years course will have extensive special expertise avail-
able on topics related to cancer and infectious disease.
Mornings will be devoted to lectures and structured dis-
cussions. After lunch, participants will gather in small
groups for faculty led discussions on a number of spe-
cialized topics such as strategies to prevent antibiotic
resistance, the role of infection in mental disorders, how
social evolution theory might advance new chemother-
apy strategies, how viral sequences get incorporated
into genomes, the role of imprinting in controlling gene
expression. Participants will be in small workgroups
with faculty and others who share specialized interests.
Most workgroups will investigate a specic topic, for
instance, malignant melanoma, cervical cancer, breast
cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, antibiotic resis-
tance, or vaccine design. Other groups will address
other topics such as strategies for educating physicians,
creating curriculum materials, or current debates about
levels of selection. Each group will develop a possi-
ble research or teaching project, for presentation on
Friday. Individuals are also free to create their own
projects. Late afternoons are not prescheduled, so par-
ticipants can organize their own additional discussions
and projects or pursue individual interests, including
recreation in Acadia National Park. Several optional
preplanned expeditions are available, including whale
watching, and guided hikes in the park. More informa-

Just a reminder that the WORKSHOP DEADLINE
(for the lecture) IS APPROACHING!!!
The Organizing Committee would like to invite you to
attend a 3-day international workshop on the \Evolu-
tion and Ecology of Host-Associated Microbiota" to be
held at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel,
Switzerland on September 12- 14, 2012. The major
aim of this workshop is to provide a synthesis of the
emerging evolutionary and ecological patterns govern-
ing the complex interactions of host-microbiota across
dierent biological systems. We have invited leaders
in the eld of host-associated microbiota and micro-
bial ecology to share their insights on the evolutionary
and ecological principles that shape bacterial commu-
nity structure and host-microbiota interactions.
This workshop is intended for undergraduate students,
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early
career investigators (100 slots available) who wanted to
be exposed to the evolutionary and ecological conceptsand bioinformatics tools being applied on the study of
host-associated microbiota systems and microbial ecol-
ogy. Together with the lecture, a hands-on tutorial
(bioinformatic tools and approaches encompassing mi-
crobial ecology, comparative genomics, molecular evo-
lution) will be provided on the analysis of complex se-
quence data sets derived from next-generation sequenc-
ing.
Thanks to the generous funding from ProDoc of the
Swiss National Science Foundation and the University
of Basel, we are only charging a minimal fee of CHF
150 for registration (includes 3 lunches, 1 social
dinner, 2 social mixers and snacks during the entire
workshop) or CHF 250 (+ tutorial on the analysis of
next-generation sequences; 50 slots available). We also
have arranged for a number of rooms around Basel
ranging from youth hostel dormitories (CHF 32-79/
day) to 3-star hotels (CHF 160- 250/ day). Moreover,
Basel/Mulhouse Airport is a hub for Easyjet, a budget
airline in Europe. Application deadline for the tutorial
is May 30 and for the lecture series is June 30, 2012.

Women in Science Workshops, July 8 & 9, Ottawa, 2012
At this year's Joint Congress in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy in Ottawa, Canada, (http://www.confersense.ca/-
Evolution2012/index.htm) we are happy to announce
two complementary workshops on issues relating to
women in science. The rst, held on Sunday, July 8,
will focus on increasing diversity in evolutionary biology
by advancing the leadership of women, and is targeted
to faculty. The second, held on Monday, July 9, is the
fourth annual \Symposium for women entering ecology
and evolution" (SWEEET - http://www.ecoevo.ca/-
SWEEET/) with this year's theme focusing on career
options beyond academia.
1. \Advancing diversity in evolution: faculty men-
toring panel, discussion & social" Sunday, July 8, 7-
8:30pm Host: Jenny Boughman, Michigan State Uni-
versity This event is focused on increasing diversity in
evolutionary biology by advancing leadership of women
in the sciences. How can we increase the success of
women after they've been hired as faculty, so that more
women get onto the tenure track, then receive tenure
and go on to positions in academic and scientic lead-
ership? There are many excellent programs and events
for women graduate students and postdocs; these are
much needed because moving from these stages into fac-
ulty positions is a critical juncture. However, very few
programs or eorts are targeted at women at the next
stages of their careers to help women position them-
selves to be leaders in their elds and at their institu-
tions. This event hopes to begin lling that gap. Both
genders and people from all ethnic backgrounds are
invited to attend. Light refreshments will be served.
A partial list of panelists includes: Michelle Dudash,
University of Maryland Hanna Kokko, Australian Na-
tional University Helen Rodd, University of Toronto
Nina Weddell, University of Exeter
2. \Knowing your options and getting the job you
want: career options beyond academia" Monday, July
9, 1:15 - 5pm followed by a social mixer with speak-
ers Host: SWEEET 2012 (http://www.ecoevo.ca/-
SWEEET/2012meeting.html) SWEEET is a sympo-
sium intended to address issues that inuence the ad-
vancement of women from postgraduate degrees into
academic, government, NGO and industry positions80 EvolDir July 1, 2012
from backgrounds in ecology and evolution. The tran-
sition into a permanent job is a critical step that in-
volves many challenges - many of these are particu-
larly relevant to women, who tend to be under repre-
sented in scientic careers. At this year's SWEEET
we will be discussing two related topics on the theme
of career options outside of academia including \Tac-
tical advice for moving your academic skills into a
non-academic position" and \Carving your own niche
- women in non-traditional careers in science". We
are pleased to announce our exciting list conrmed
speakers: Dr. Suzanne Fortier, President, NSERC Dr.
Bronwyn Keatley, Senior Policy Advisor, Fisheries and
Oceans Canada Dr. Lalita Acharya, Science and Tech-
nology Division, Library of Parliament Dr. Jenny Car-
penter, Freelance journalist. The format of the sympo-
sium encourages active participation between speakers
and the audience. Speakers will discuss their personal
journey to their current career, challenges along the
way and will provide advice to early-career scientists
interested in keeping their career options open. We en-
courage and welcome women and men to attend.

jevents/icalrepeat.detail/2012/06/11/196/-/-EVOLTREE Summer School: Genome-wide asso-
ciation studies using mixed models >From Wednesday,
5. September 2012 To Friday, 7. September 2012
Tentative programme: This course will provide a gen-
eral background for statistical models used in associ-
ation studies with an emphasis on mixed model ap-
proaches. Multi-trait and multi-locus extensions of
models of genotype-phenotype association will be dis-
cussed with applications to data and hands-on exam-
ples. The course will cover both genotype- pheno-
type associations and genotype-environment associa-
tions and discuss parallels between these approaches.
In addition, we will discuss downstream analyses (e.g.,
gene set and functional class enrichment and experi-
mental work) that can be used to help validate asso-
ciation study results and to clarify the biological basis
for the observed signals. Finally, participants will re-
ceive practical experience running analyses with a sam-
ple data set using R packages.
1. Introduction to mixed models with application to
genotype-phenotype association studies 2. Another ap-
plication of mixed models: genotype-environment as-
sociation studies. 3. More complex models such as
multi-trait and multi-locus models. 4. Range-wide ver-
sus population-specic analyses - pros and cons of using
geographically restricted versus range-wide sampling 5.
Methods for validating the results and integrating re-
sults with other genome-wide information (e.g, enrich-
ment of likely functional variants, relevant candidate
gene sets, experimental follow-up) and making biologi-
cal interpretations 6. Practical experience using R with
a sample data set

EVOLTREE Summer School: Population genetic
and genomic approaches >From Monday, 24. Septem-
ber 2012 To Friday, 28. September 2012
Full title: Population genetic and genomic approaches
to mitigate global climate change impacts on forest ge-
netic resources and to breed more resilient trees
Description: Global climate change poses a major chal-
lenge for most boreal and temperate forests. Climate
inuences growth rate, adaptation and survival of forest
trees. Global climate change can lead to both extinc-
tion of forests in more arid and colder environments and
expansion in wetter and warmer ones. The fast changesJuly 1, 2012 EvolDir 81
in climate can also threaten forest genetic resources or
make them more vulnerable. The proposed summer
school will teach how the application of population ge-
netics and genomics can help to tackle this challenge
and guide forest protection and conservation programs
aimed to mitigate undesirable eects of global climate
change. It will also demonstrate how modern genomic
selection can be used for breeding more resilient trees
that will be productive in harsh and variable environ-
ments. The proposed summer school will teach also
population genetics and genomics tools and methods
that can be used to better characterize available forest
tree genetic resources.
Topics: - Human and global climate change impacts on
forest genetic resources - Genetic implications of for-
est management - Forest population genetics and ge-
nomics: an introduction to tools and methods - Associ-
ation mapping of environmental and genetic variables -
Spatial analysis in forest population genetics and ecoge-
nomics - Gene ow, forest regeneration and assisted mi-
gration - Genomic selection for more resilient trees
Participants: PhD students and young scientists inter-
ested in the application of modern methods and ap-
proaches of population genetics and

Switzerland PhenotypeVariation
Aug4-7
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce our workshop on 'The evo-
lution of consistent phenotype variation: alternative
tactics vs. behavioural syndromes'. The workshop is
to be held in Adelboden, a beautifully located village
in the Swiss Alps, from August 04 to August 07, 2012.
The target audience for this meeting is PhD students,
advanced MSc students and post-docs in Ecology and
Evolution.
The program of the workshop will consist of a combi-
nation of plenary talks by invited speakers and work
performed in small groups, in which the participants
will discuss a particular theme together with one of the
invited speakers. The results of these small-group ses-
sions will be presented to the other participants, fol-
lowed by a plenary discussion. On the last day of the82 EvolDir July 1, 2012
meeting all participants are invited to join in a scenic
hike to one of the numerous lookouts or mountain peaks
in the vicinity of Adelboden (there will be options for
all grades of tness and spirit of adventure), which will
allow to experience pristine alpine landscapes and oer
breath-taking views.
Besides others the invited speakers will be:

Workshop description
The coexistence of alternative behavioural and life
history tactics within a population is an evolution-
ary puzzle studied since decades by several biological
disciplines, ranging from population genetics to eco-
physiology and behavioural ecology. More recently, the
consistent behavioural variation of individuals within
a population generating unimodal trait distributions
has received much interest, because directional selection
should generate 'optimal' phenotypes or behavioural
exibility instead of a broad array of phenotypes spe-
cializing in dierent solutions to the same environmen-
tal or social challenge. It is currently not well under-
stood which mechanisms are responsible for continu-
ous or bimodal/multimodal trait distributions. This is
partly due to the independent, parallel development of
two research elds that focus either on alternative be-
havioural tactics or on behavioural syndromes/animal
personalities. This meeting aims to combine these dif-
ferent research elds. Leading scientists from both
elds will be invited to lecture on this issue and to
supervise workshop groups of participants addressing
the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for consistent
phenotype variation within populations.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected84 EvolDir July 1, 2012
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
