Meeting on Mechanisms of Protein Evolution
December 5-7, 2011
Denver, CO, USA
http://www.evolutionarygenomics.com/-
MMPE Denver/ The meeting will focus on explicit
consideration of biophysical and systems biology
principles to generate a mechanistic understanding of
selective pressures and the impacts of neutral evolu-
tionary processes. Topics will include interaction with
phylogenetics, adaptation, coevolution, convergence,
neutral processes, and other topics of concern to the
study of molecular biology and evolution.
This will be a small meeting, with plenty of opportu-
nity for interaction. Talks by students as well as more
senior investigators are encouraged.
Organized by David Pollock (University of Colorado
School of Medicine), David Liberles (University ofWyoming), and Rachel Mueller (Colorado State Uni-
versity)
The meeting is timed to also enable attendance at

and Behavior Organizers: Georg F. Striedter, John C.
Avise and Francisco J. Ayala Beckman Center of the
National Academies, Irvine, CA
Darwin never wrote much about the brain, but Dar-
win’s nemesis, Richard Owen, tried in 1861 to pro-
tect humans from Darwin’s threatening ideas by argu-
ing that human brains diﬀer fundamentally from those
of other apes. This argument provoked a spirited at-
tack by Darwin’s “bulldog,” T. H. Huxley. Darwin did
not comment publicly on this controversy, but for the
second edition of his Descent of Man, Darwin asked
Huxley to write an essay “on the resemblances and dif-
ferences in the structure and the development of the
brain in man and apes.” This essay was a forceful
attack on Owen’s argument and showed convincingly
that human brains are like fairly typical ape brains, al-
though larger. Thus the Darwinians began to contem-
plate evolving brains. This colloquium will survey what
has been learned about brain evolution in the 150 years
since the Owen-Huxley debate, bringing together lead-
ing scientists whose work illuminates the twin questions
of how and why complex nervous systems evolved.

UCologne NasoniaEvolution Jun3-6
Dear evoldir subscribers,
I would like to announce that the 2012 International
Nasonia Research Meeting will be held at the Univer-
sity of Cologne, Germany from June 3-6 . Nasonia is
a genus consisting of 4 described species of parisitoid
wasps, and has proven to be a powerful model system
with which to examine a wide variety of questions re-
lated to evolutionary processes, including: speciation
genetics, population genetics, sex determination, chem-
ical ecology, symbiosis, evolution of development, and
the evolution of behavioral traits. Technical advantages
of this system include: sequenced genomes of 3 inter-
fertile species, a multitude of genomic and genetic re-
sources (such as tiling and mapping arrays, transcrip-
tomes, molecular and morpholocial markers, etc...), ro-
bust systemic RNAi, and haplo-diploid genetics.
We invite anyone interested in learning more about this
system to join us in June in Cologne. For any questions,
and/or to indicate an interest in attending this meeting,
please contact Jeremy Lynch (jlynch@uni-koeln.de).
Best, Jeremy

Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that registration is open
for the 2012 Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithol-
ogy ’Ecology and Evolution’ Student Conference, to be
held on 4th to 6th January 2012.
The conference will take place in the University of Ox-
ford at the Department of Zoology, and it is the aim
of the conference to provide a setting for students of
various research areas within ecology and evolution to
present and discuss their work in a constructive atmo-
sphere composed mainly of their peers. In addition to
student talks and posters, the conference will consist of
a number of plenary talks given by distinguished inves-tigators. This year will see the conference broaden its
scope to embrace ideas derived from non-ornithological
systems, oﬀering the ideal opportunity for interaction
and exchange of ideas with peers and experienced re-
searchers from a wide variety of disciplines. There will
also be opportunities for students to attend workshop
sessions during the conference.

CrayﬁshGeneticVariation
PhD position available from September 2012
Genetic variation, cryptic diversity and interspeciﬁc hy-
bridization in European crayﬁsh
Charles University in Prague, Department of Ecology
Within a project on variation of both native and in-
vasive crayﬁsh species found in European waters, we
seek a student interested in disentangling the patterns
of diversity of crayﬁsh and processes that shaped them.
We will analyse samples from a wide range of European
countries, employing variety of DNA-based approaches
(from sequencing and phylogenetic methods to resolve
evolutionary relationships and identify cryptic lineages,
to microsatellite analysis of population structures and
reproductive modes, and AFLP analyses of putative
parental species and interspeciﬁc hybrids). The stu-
dent joining the project will be responsible for analyses
of samples from multiple species complexes, focusing on
spatial patterns of genetic variation, and signatures of
hybridization or gene ﬂow between coexisting lineages.
The ideal candidate for this PhD position is interested
in both ecology and evolutionary biology (experience
of aquatic invertebrates is a plus), has some experience
with work in the DNA lab and analysis of sequence
data, and is willing to learn new methods and con-
tribute to both ﬁeldwork and laboratory experiments.
An ability to successfully collaborate within a wider
team of students, and with other national and interna-
tional research groups, is a must.The student will work under supervision of Adam
Petrusek at the Department of Ecology, Faculty of Sci-
ence, Charles University in Prague. The department
has suitable facilities for the DNA work, and oﬀers
supporting work environment in a young team. The
project will be conducted in close collaboration with
other Czech astacologist groups at the Faculty of Fish-
eries and Protection of Waters, University of South Bo-
hemia, and the Faculty of Science, University of Os-
trava. The student may also spend several months
of the study in collaborating institutions abroad, and
is expected to regularly present at international meet-
ings. To be eligible, the candidate must have obtained
a degree equivalent to a biology diploma or M.Sc. by
September 2012 (interested students who are at present
in their ﬁnal year of undergraduate studies are thus el-
igible). Good knowledge of written and spoken English
is essential for candidate of any nationality (this lan-
guage is fully suﬃcient for living in Prague and work-
ing at the department, and Czech candidates must be
equally able to ﬂuently communicate with their foreign
colleagues). The position is available for up to four
years, starting in October 2012. The PhD candidate’s
net monthly income will start at 16.000 Czk (ca 670
EUR) in the ﬁrst year, and may progressively increase
with experience and achievements during the study.
(Note that living expenses in the Czech Republic are
generally lower than in Western European countries.)
If interested, send a letter outlining your past research,
motivation for this position and speciﬁc experience
(max. 2 pages), CV, list of publications or confer-
ence presentations (if available), abstract of Master or
Diploma thesis, and contact details of 2-3 senior sci-
entists that can provide references on you in a sin-
gle PDF ﬁle to petrusek@cesnet.cz until mid-February10 EvolDir December 1, 2011
2012. Pre-selected candidates will be encouraged to
submit an oﬃcial application to the university when
the call for this position formally opens.

ColoradoStateU AvianEvolution
Ph.D. Assistantship in Avian Evolutionary Ecology.
We seek a self-motivated and creative doctoral student
to conduct research on the population structure, re-
productive ecology, and dispersal of the Island Scrub-
Jay. Fieldwork will start in spring 2012 and the student
will enroll at Colorado State University (CSU) in the
2012 fall semester. This dissertation research will be
part of multi-investigator project involving CSU, the
Smithsonian Institution, the Cornell Lab of Ornithol-
ogy, and The Nature Conservancy. The student will
be co-advised by Drs. Cameron Ghalambor and Chris
Funk at CSU and by Dr. Scott Sillett at the Smithso-
nian, and be supported by both teaching and research
assistantships.
A key project objective is to understand how popula-
tion structure and dispersal processes can inform con-
servation management of the jay and the California
Channel Islands. The student will have freedom to de-
velop her/his own thesis topic, so long as the disserta-
tion overlaps suﬃciently with this objective.
We welcome applications from prospective students
with a record of academic excellence, a strong inter-
est in evolution and avian ecology, and extensive train-
ing in the observation, capture, and handling of wild
birds. Ideal candidates will have a Master’s degree,
at least one publication, and graduate coursework in
statistics and genetics. The successful applicant will
need to meet the entrance requirements for doctoral
candidates at CSU’s Department of Biology ( http://-
www.biology.colostate.edu/graduate-programs ).

The Hare Lab in the Department of Natural Resources
at Cornell University is recruiting a MS/PhD student
to study larval dispersal and functional genetics of oys-
ter survivorship using genomic DNA sequence analy-
ses of wild-sampled oysters and genome mapping of in-
bred lines. A two year New York Sea Grant Scholar
Fellowship is available to support a student begin-
ning May or August 2012 (pending federal funding of
NOAA/Seagrant). Available funding dictates entry as
a MS student but transition to a PhD is possible con-
tingent on future funding.
The hypotheses being tested are motivated by the need
to optimize oyster restoration procedures with respect
to choice of broodstock and spatial arrangement of re-
stored reefs. Further motivation comes from basic evo-
lutionary genetics questions about functional genetic
diﬀerentiation across physical environmental gradients
within estuaries. The primary fellowship focus will be
the application of bioinformatic tools to achieve popula-
tion genomic analyses. Therefore, preferred applicants

PhD position in Evolutionary Biology / Behavioural

Fully funded PhD studentship starting October 2012
Sibling competition and indirect genetic eﬀects: a
systems-genetics analysis14 EvolDir December 1, 2011
Indirect genetic eﬀects occur when genes expressed in
other individuals aﬀect the phenotype of a focal individ-
ual. These eﬀects are particularly important in sibling
interactions and competition over maternal resources
but to date we know very little about how genetic vari-
ation in socially interacting individuals aﬀects ﬁtness
of a focal individual. To this end we are conducting a
large experiment in genetically fully characterized mice
collecting life history and behavioural phenotypes.
This is a largely computational project during which
you will develop systems-genetics approaches to estab-
lish networks of lower-order phenotypes (e.g. physiolog-
ical traits) and their underlying candidate genes that
together aﬀect complex life history and behavioural
phenotypes in socially interacting individuals. Using
DNA seq and gene expression data derived from the
largest genetic reference system in mammals, BXD
mice, you will be analyzing complex life history and
behavioural phenotypes to identify candidate genes,
pleiotropic gene eﬀects through correlational analyses,
and networks of functionally linked traits and their un-
derlying genetic variants. The aim is to build up net-
works of genes, their eﬀects and links to lower order
phenotypes and how these relate to variation seen in
complex life history and behavioural traits.
Successful candidates are encouraged to develop their
own research ideas in conjunction with ongoing research
in evolutionary biology. There is also the opportunity
to contribute to teaching on ﬁeld courses in Africa,
South and Central America.
Further Information This studentship is open to all na-
tionalities although no funding is available to cover the
higher tuition fees for non-EU applicants and EU appli-
cants from outside in the UK must have been resident in
the UK for purposes other than education for 3 or more
years to qualify for the living expenses stipend. Appli-
cants should have an excellent undergraduate record
and ideally some research experience. Further infor-
mation can be obtained by contacting Reinmar Hager

ical Station (KBS) of Michigan State University work-
ing under the supervision of Elena Litchman and col-
laborating with faculty and students at the Univer-
sity of Texas-Austin, Wellesley College, University of
California-Santa Barbara, East Tennessee State Uni-
versity and Irkutsk State University. The student will
conduct experiments and ﬁeld work at Lake Baikal and
in the lab in Michigan to assess key functional traits in
common endemic and cosmopolitan phytoplankton.
The deadline for application is December 1, 2011

NorthCarolinaStateU PestEvolution
NorthCarolinaStateU.IGERTGeneticEngineeringSociety
We are pleased to announce a new NSF funded, IGERT
doctoral program in “Genetic Engineering and Society:
The Case of Transgenic Pests”. We are now accepting
applications and are looking for students interested in
the evolutionary aspects of genetically managing pests
through the use of transgenic strains.
The doctoral program will examine questions linked
to the genetic modiﬁcation of mosquitoes, mice, ﬁsh,
and other species that aﬀect human health, biodiver-
sity, and sustainable development. The general ﬁeld of
inquiry is referred to as “Genetic Pest Management”.
The ﬁrst cohort of students starting in July 2012 will fo-
cus on issues related to mosquitoes that vector malaria
and dengue. Some evolutionary questions are: What
are the ﬁtness costs associated with an engineered trait
and how will it impact the spread of an engineered self-
ish genetic element? Will resistance evolve to some
transgenic traits faster than to others? What is the
best spatial and temporal pattern for release of a spe-
ciﬁc transgenic strain? What evolutionary tools can be
used for pre-release evaluation of a strain?Students interested in the molecular genetic aspects of
the program will focus on building strains or novel gene
drive mechanisms. We will also address questions such
as: What are the social, ethical, and ecological conse-
quences of these techniques? How can all stakeholders
be involved in decisions about these products?
We are looking for excellent students who have ma-
jored in a biological science but have a strong interest in
and a background in humanities, mathematics, and/or
a social science. Students in this program will receive a
broad and rigorous graduate training across these areas
with emphasis in their chosen ﬁeld. We also welcome
students who have a masters degree and want strong
interdisciplinary training at the doctoral level.
Students who participate in the program will receive a
PhD in a home doctoral program and a graduate mi-
nor in “Genetic Engineering and Society”. The minor
will include four courses, one of which will be taught in
Peru. In addition to full fellowships (2-3 years at $30K
per year), funds are available for international intern-
ships. After the ﬁrst 2-3 years students will receive a
stipend within the normal range associated with their
home doctoral program.
Please visit our website for more details on the pro-
gram, including a list of participating faculty: http:/-

Subject: Artemia franciscana is the only native brine
shrimp in North America. It has become an invasive
species in many other parts of the world owing to its
extensive export for use in aquaculture. In Spain and
other countries of the Mediterranean region, the na-
tive Artemia taxa A. salina and A. parthenogenetica
are threatened by the spread of A. franciscana, which
quickly outcompetes the native species. Earlier work
in our group has addressed the molecular ecology of all
these taxa in Spain and the Mediterranean. This work
has shown there is a very high level of genetic variation
between diﬀerent populations of A. salina, such that
each population lost represents a signiﬁcant loss of ge-
netic biodiversity. Studies of the invasion genetics of
A. franciscana shows that the major sources of invasive
populations are the Great Salt Lake and San Francisco
Bay in the USA, and that there have been multiple in-
troductions into Spain, combined with dispersal of the
invasive between locations via birds such as ﬂamingos.
Now, for the ﬁrst time, we have the opportunity for
a major study of the genetics of natural populations
of A. franciscana in Canada. We have samples from
c.30 natural hypersaline lakes in Saskatchewan and
British Columbia provinces, and aim to study the ge-
netic diﬀerences using both mitochondrial markers and
microsatellites. Based on our results for A. salina, we
hypothesize a high degree of structure, owing to strong
monopolization eﬀects and local adaptation. This ge-
netic variation between populations will be studied in
relation to geographical distances between lakes, lake
size, lake chemistry (are there similarities between pop-
ulations from lakes with a similar salt composition?),
and possibly variation in other zooplankton from the
same areas (e.g. the fairy shrimps Branchinecta).

TuftsU SpeciationBiology
Graduate Position: Speciation Biology at Tufts
The Dopman Lab at Tufts University is seeking a doc-
toral student for Fall 2012 with an interest in specia-
tion biology. The long-range goal of our research pro-
gram is to gain a better understanding of how genes
evolve to restrict gene ﬂow within the context of ac-
cumulating isolating barriers that ultimately produce
new species. As most life on earth arises following thecombined action of multiple isolating barriers, some our
deepest insights will come by genetically dissecting bar-
riers that are widespread across taxa and eliminate dis-
proportionate amounts of gene ﬂow between daughter
lineages. Emerging research reveals that ecological and
behavioral barriers satisfy both criteria.
The Ostrinia genus is well suited to studying speciation
because we have information on genetics, ecology, and
sexual communication for numerous species. One of
the better known Ostrinia is the European Corn Borer
(ECB) moth. The ECB is a commonly cited model
for speciation biology because sympatric “strains” are
at the early stages of divergence and therefore provide
a window into the evolutionary process of speciation.
Of 12 potential isolating barriers between ECB strains,
seven signiﬁcantly reduce gene ﬂow and ﬁve are either
behavioral or ecological in nature. Current eﬀorts in
our lab are dedicated to elucidating the genetic basis
for phenotypes underlying relevant ecological and be-
havioral barriers between strains, and determining the
consequences of this variation for gene ﬂow.
We seek a creative and motivated graduate student to
work on speciation using the ECB as a model, but the
potential for developing new research directions is high.
Students must have the ability to work with others and
a sense of humor, both of which are needed to make
science fun and worthwhile. A strong undergraduate
background in evolutionary biology is required, as is
prior research experience. Relevant and highly desir-
able experience includes application of molecular ge-
netic techniques or computational analysis of gene or
genome/transcriptome data.
The Dopman Lab is in the Department of Biology and
is a member of Tufts’ Collaborative Cluster in Genome
Structure and Developmental Patterning. The Clus-
ter focuses on genome to organism research and is lo-
cated at a new Tufts facility on the main campus in
Medford, MA. With two additional Tufts campuses (in
Boston and Grafton), other research universities (Har-
vard, MIT, BU), and the vibrant city of Boston all
within reach, Medford and Tufts are ideal places to live

format the following documents: (1) a 1-2 page cover
letter that includes a statement of research interests,
relevant educational background, and prior research
experience; and (2) a CV that includes GPA/GRE
scores and the names and contact information of 2-3
references. Applications to the graduate program are

UAuckland MetagenomicsMSc in Metagenomics
An important part of metagenomics is determining
the species composition of environmental samples using
high throughput sequencing technologies and bioinfor-
matics. One issue is the degree to which organisms are
detectable in environmental samples. An MSc research
project is available in 2012 for someone interested in ad-
dressing this question with samples collected in two re-
search projects from the Hauraki Gulf area (Auckland,
New Zealand): soil samples from Little Barrier Island
and marine invertebrates from the water column. This
project will involve the preparation of samples for high
throughput sequencing and the bioinformatic analyses
of the sequencing data. This project oﬀers the oppor-
tunity to contribute to larger projects, involving mem-
bers of the Allan Wilson Centre, Dr Rochelle Constan-
tine and others, to characterise the biodiversity in these
communities.
Funding A bursary equivalent to the MSc tuition fees
for a domestic student ($6,259-7,253) will be provided
to a suitable applicant. Funding has been obtained for
next generation sequencing of all relevant samples and
other lab expenses.
This is a 1-year research project that would suit some-
one with a BSc(hons) or postgraduate diploma quali-
ﬁcation. It is hoped that the student can begin their
research in March 2012.

UBern BehaviouralEvolution
2 PhD POSITIONS IN BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY
Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern,
Switzerland20 EvolDir December 1, 2011
1) PhD ’GENETIC BASIS OF COOPERATION’: The
aim of this PhD-project is to investigate the genetic
basis of cooperative behaviour in highly social African
cichlids. These ﬁsh have turned into a model species
for studies of social evolution based on detailed infor-
mation about their ecology and behaviour, excellent
possibilities for behavioural and physiological experi-
ments and recent sequencing of their full genome. We
shall pursue a dual approach: (1) a quantitative ge-
netics study employing a large-scale breeding experi-
ment and (2) an ecological genomics approach using
molecular biology tools. The project will involve in-
tensive behavioural observations, quantitative genetics
modeling and lab work for brain gene expression anal-
yses. Eligible candidates will have a master’s degree
(or Diplom) in Biology and research experience in an-
imal behaviour, a genuine understanding of evolution-
ary theory and a strong commitment to basic science.
Practical skills in molecular and/or quantitative ge-
netics techniques and in empirical work with ﬁsh are
beneﬁcial, but not a precondition. The project will
be mostly based in Bern, but will involve collabora-
tion with two co-supervisors, Nadia Aubin-Horth (Uni-
versity Laval, Canada) and Mathias K¨ olliker (Univer-
sity of Basel, Switzerland). The position is part of the
Doctoral Research Program (“ProDoc”) funded by the
Swiss National Science Foundation SNF on “Proximate
and ultimate causes of cooperation” and will connect up
to 30 PhD students working on animal cooperation by
a research network. Supervisor of this project: Barbara
Taborsky.
2) PhD ’ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE TAC-
TICS’: The aim of this PhD-project is to study
the adaptive responses to mating competition of
conspeciﬁcs pursuing alternative reproductive tactics
(ARTs) that are either ﬁxed for life or dependent on
condition. Evolutionary theory predicts that nega-
tive frequency dependence will select for tactic fre-
quencies generating equal lifetime ﬁtnesses when ARTs
reﬂect genetic morphs. In contrast, when ARTs are
purely conditional they may yield diﬀerent ﬁtness pay-
oﬀs. African cichlids showing both types of ARTs
will serve as experimental model for this study. It
will involve competitive in vitro fertilization experi-
ments, behavioural and environmental manipulations,
and - depending on focus - ﬁeld work on Lake Tan-
ganyika and/or research on physiological control mech-
anisms. Eligible candidates will have a master’s degree
(or Diplom) in Biology and research experience in an-
imal behaviour, a genuine understanding of evolution-
ary theory and a strong commitment to basic science.
Practical skills in behavioural observation, multivari-
ate statistics, physiological techniques, empirical workwith ﬁsh and scientiﬁc publication (e.g. of the mas-
ter’s thesis) will be helpful, but are not a precondition.
Supervisor of this project: Michael Taborsky.
Both positions are for three years and should preferably
start in early 2012.
The successful candidates will join a bustling research
environment consisting of ca. 15 PhD-students and
advanced research staﬀ, ﬁve technicians and a vary-
ing number of master’s students and guest scientists.
Besides this Behavioural Ecology group, the Institute
of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Bern
comprises research groups in Aquatic Ecology (Ole
Seehausen), Community Ecology (Wolfgang Nentwig),
Conservation Biology (Raphael Arlettaz), Evolution-
ary Ecology (Heinz Richner) and Population Genetics
(Laurent Excoﬃer). Salaries will follow the schemes of
the national funding organization of Switzerland.
Closing date: Open until ﬁlled, but all application ma-
terials, including CV, a summary of research experi-
ence, copies of any published or in-press papers, and
two letters of recommendation should be received by 22
December 2011 to ensure full consideration. Candidates

A Ph.D. position in Computational Genomics and Phy-
logenetics are available at the Institute of Evolution at
the University of Haifa.
The research projects will be done in collaboration with
the Phylogenetics and Computational Genomics lab of
Dr. Sagi Snir.
Next Generation Sequencing has opened up unprece-
dented opportunities for researches from the quantita-
tive sciences. Genomic sequences of enormous quanti-
ties are available for all sort of advanced biological anal-
ysis. Analytical skills beyond the traditional biological
training are imprative. The positions are targeted to
two projects:
1. The project is focused on large scale phylogenet-
ics reconstruction by means of the supertree method.
The project is based on algorithmic and computa-
tional/mathematical tools for piecing together the tree
of life. We represent trees in a special graph and ap-
ply speciﬁc graph algorithms such as MaxCut on this
graph. Preliminary results show advantages over ex-
isting methods. As these tasks are computationally
hard, we employ probabilistic approaches to obtain the
results. We investigate both theoretical and practical
questions associated with this approach.
2. Detection and analysis of horizontal gene trans-
fer (HGT) in prokaryotes. HGT is a major factor in
prokaryotic evolution and plays a signiﬁcant role in de-
veloping antibiotic resistance. We have developed sev-
eral novel methods to detect HGT where existing meth-
ods fail. The methods use evolutionary signals, unique
to HGT, that are detected by non trivial statistical ap-
proaches.
Both projects are funded by highly competitive grants
that provide high fellowships. Outstanding candidates
from both exact and life sciences are encouraged to ap-
ply. Qualiﬁed candidates will earn very high salaries.
Familiarity with computational/mathematical biology
is favourable. Essential requirements include pro-
ﬁciency in computer-programming skills, such as
C/C++/Java and scripting languages (e.g. Perl, Phy-
ton), demonstrated ability in applying the devised al-
gorithms.
The Institute of Evolution is world leading in broad as-December 1, 2011 EvolDir 23

both algorithmic and evolutionary appeal with ample
collaboration with other leading labs around the world.

MSc and PhD student positions to study ant evolution-
ary genomics
Department of Ecology and Evolution University of
Lausanne, Switzerland
MSc and PhD positions are available in the lab
of Prof. Laurent Keller ( http://www.unil.ch/dee/-
page6763 en.html ). Our group is interested in the prin-
ciples governing the behavior, ecology, and evolution
of animal societies. While this is richly described by
theory, how this is translated to the molecular level
is virtually unknown. We have recently published the
genome of the red imported ﬁre ant and the lab contin-
ues to develop genomic infrastructures in this species.
We use genomic approaches to identify candidate genes
and pathways that are associated with the biology of
social insects. In particular, we are using next gener-
ation sequencing to study gene expression and popu-
lation genetics in ﬁre ants. Ultimately, our goal is to
elucidate the evolution of molecular mechanisms un-
derlying traits that characterize social insects. Possible
research topics include, but are not limited to, social
behavior, caste determination, immunity, and aging.
Candidates should be highly motivated and have a
background in bioinformatics and in molecular, ge-
nomic, or cell biology. Good knowledge of English is re-
quired. Interested applicants should send a short sum-
mary of research interests and experiences (in English),
a curriculum vitae, as well as the names, emails andphone numbers of 2 references to Eyal Privman:

ULausanne PlantEvolution
A three-year PhD studentship is available for research
on the evolution of plant sexual systems and mating
strategies in the Department of Ecology and Evolu-
tion at the University of Lausanne. The projectX.
Flowering plants display a bewildering range of ﬂoral
forms that have evolved to meet the challenges of re-
lying on animals, wind or water for pollen transfer.
Particularly interesting are the factors responsible for,
and the implications of, transitions between contrasting
forms or strategies. This project will study the ecol-
ogy and genetics of evolutionary transitions between
outcrossing, on the one hand, and an ability to self-
fertilize, on the other. The student will work on one (or
both) of two diﬀerent study systems: the breakdown of
self-incompatibility in an insect-pollinated species of a
Spanish species of toadﬂax, Linaria cavanillesii; and the
evolution of inﬂorescence architecture in Spanish popu-
lations of the wind-pollinated European species Mercu-
rialis annua following the evolution of hermaphroditism
from separate sexes. The project is likely to involve a
combination of ﬁeld-work, manipulative experiments of
plant mating strategies, parentage analysis using molec-
ular markers, analysis of the genetic and genomic impli-
cations of transitions between outcrossing and selﬁng,
and the possibility of some theoretical modelling.
The labX. The project will be conducted in John Pan-
nells lab in Lausanne, and will fall squarely within the
current research interests of the group. At present,
we are working on the ecological and genetic fac-
tors underlying two major transitions that have taken
place repeatedly in plants: the evolution of separate
sexes from hermaphroditism, and vice versa; and the
evolution of an ability to self-fertilize. What causes
these transitions, and what are their genetic and de-
mographic implications? We are also currently in-
terested in how reproductive eﬀort and sex allocation
evolve when individuals have to compete for both re-
sources and mating opportunities, and in the evolu-
tion of sex-determination mechanisms and sex chro-
mosomes. For further information and a list of pub-
lications, see: http://www.unil.ch/dee/page86963.html

student opportunity) for an enthusiastic researcher to
work in the ﬁeld of morphological and molecular Phy-
logeny of the Trichoptera subfamily Drusinae. As part
of a project funded by the Austrian Science Founda-
tion (FWF), the ﬁrst cornerstone of the PhD thesis
will deal with a morphological data matrix which will
be expanded by adding new characters from species cur-
rently in our collections not yet fully coded and by ad-
ditional species collected by separate collecting teams
during the project. The expected output will be a com-
plete character matrix relevant for all existing Drusinae
species. The second cornerstone will consist of phylo-
genetic analyses of morphological and molecular data
sets via parsimony, Bayesian MCMCMC and Maximum
likelihood inferences. The expected output of this the-
sis section will signiﬁcantly reﬁne the resolution of the
phylogenetic relationships of the subfamily known so
far. The expected publication eﬀort of the PhD student
will also comprise a comprehensive key for all Drusinae
species. The PhD candidate will be trained at the De-
partment of Limnology (University of Vienna) by Prof.

UWyoming Biodiversity
Graduate Assistantship: Climate Change, Water, and
Ecosystem Services University of Wyoming
I am recruiting a MS or PhD student to investigate
how long-term changes in climate will impact water
(distribution, abundance, quality) and ecosystem ser-
vices (e.g., biodiversity and livestock production) in
Wyoming range systems. The eﬀects of climate change
are critically important in semi-arid systems where wa-
ter is the ultimate limiting factor. Water availability
is predicted to decrease in Wyoming rangelands re-
gardless of precipitation due to temperature-related in-
creases in vegetative evapotranspiration rates. In ad-
dition, annual water supply in high elevation systems
is dependent on spring snowmelt from the mountains
which may be signiﬁcantly impacted by shifts in pre-
cipitation timing. Water shortage has negative conse-
quences for both biodiversity and human resource use.
Semi-permanent wetlands are indicators of surface wa-
ter availability. The selected student will use ﬁeld-based
and remotely-sensed data to characterize wetlands and
quantify biodiversity. The student will then link these
components with human resource use under alternative
scenarios of climate change. Student will also have the
opportunity to incorporate molecular methods to quan-
tify biodiversity and landscape connectivity (landscape
genetics approaches using population genetics).
Prospective students with a background in natural re-
sources, ecology, evolution, and/or population genetics
are encouraged to apply. Evidence of robust analyti-
cal skills, scientiﬁc writing, strong work ethic, passion
for scientiﬁc inquiry, ability to work under harsh ﬁeld
conditions and aptitude for collaborative research are
expected.

bution and functional connectivity of animal speciesDecember 1, 2011 EvolDir 31

Expenses-paid ﬁeld assistant positions to study evolu-
tion of family living and cooperative breeding in birds
in Spain
We are seeking applicants for ﬁeld research volunteers
for the upcoming breeding season to join our ﬁeld
project investigating the evolution of family living and
cooperative breeding in birds. The research is con-
ducted in Andalusia, southern Spain. Starting dates
range from the end of February to the middle of March
and work will continue through June.
Our project researches the shifts in parental investment
patterns in pair living, kin-group living and coopera-
tively breeding birds. The project is based at the Uni-
versity of Bern, Switzerland (PI Michael Griesser, PhD
students Emeline Mourocq & Gretchen Wagner).
The work of the volunteers will consist of carrying out
ﬁeld experiments, locating nests, assisting the PhD stu-
dents with catching and ringing birds, behavioral ob-
servations and data management. This work will give
insight into experimental ﬁeldwork and is carried out in
scenic semi-arid habitats of southern Spain. We work
all day, 5-6 days per week, in the ﬁeld depending on the
workload. Observe that temperatures at the beginning
of the ﬁeld season can be below 0ÆC, and later in the
breeding season be easily above 35ÆC. The work can
be physically strenuous at times.
Qualiﬁcations: (1) BSc or higher in Biology or simi-
lar qualiﬁcation (2) Ability to work and live in small
groups and sociable personality (3) Fluent in English
(4) Previous ﬁeld experience a plus (5) Knowledge in
observing & handling birds is a plus (6) Driving license

UBern FieldAssist SwedishLapland
Expenses paid ﬁeld assistant positions to study life-
history evolution in Siberian Jays in Swedish Lapland
For the upcoming ﬁeld season (from March to the end of
July 2012) we are looking for highly motivated expenses
paid ﬁeld volunteers to join our ﬁeld project investigat-
ing life-history evolution in Siberian jays (Perisoreus
infaustus). The study population is located near Arvid-
sjaur, Swedish Lapland.
Our current project investigates the inﬂuence of dis-
persal timing and female quality on the evolution of
life-history strategies. The project is jointly driven
by Michael Griesser (University of Bern, Switzerland),
Prof. Jan Ekman (Uppsala University, Sweden), and
Joanna Sendecka (Uppsala University, Sweden).
The work of the ﬁeld volunteers will be to help in ﬁeld
experiments, behavioural observations, following radio-
tagged birds, and data management. This work will
give insight into exciting experimental ﬁeldwork and
will be carried out partly in managed forests and partly
in scenic pristine boreal habitats. We will work 5-7 days
per week in the ﬁeld depending on the workload of the
experiments. Days in the ﬁeld can be long in particular
around midsummer when following dispersing individ-
uals. Observe that temperatures in the beginning of
the season can be as low as -30C. The work is physi-
cally strenuous at times in particular during the snow
melting period.
Assistants can apply for either the whole season, or
from March-mid May, and from mid-May-July. Assis-
tants working from March to May will be doing most
of the ﬁeldwork on X-country skis, and given that only
the edge of the study site is accessible by car, we ski
up to 20km per day. Thus, a previous knowledge of
X-country skiing is helpful, but not required.Qualiﬁcations: (1) BSc/MSc in Biology, Ecology or
similar qualiﬁcation (2) Previous ﬁeld experience (3)
Ability to work in small teams and sociable personal-
ity (4) Knowledge in observing & handling birds is a

454 sequencing problems
Hello,
I’ve had problems with a 454 FLX run and nobody (nei-
ther Roche or my sequence provider) is able to work out
what is going wrong. The samples, which are amplicons
of 200-300bp, appear to be of good quality, but the pro-
cess falls over at the last hurdle. Below is an outline
of the scenario. I’d be very grateful for any advice,
or to hear if anybody has had a similar problem (and
hopefully solved it!).
Cheers,
Oliver
* The templates are of good quality and concentration,
established by agilent and nanodrop.
* There aren’t any short fragments that would cause
problems. There are some short-ish fragments around
150bp, but they were intentional.* There are appropriate adaptors (LibL), established
by qPCR and an emulsion titration.
* Small volume emPCR works well,
* Large volume emPCR gives much lower than expected
results, and when we’ve tried sequencing the resulting
beads they seem to cause failure of the processing ﬁl-
ters, suggesting mixed reads.

Amphibian primers
Hi everyone,
I am doing my PhD on the Conservation and Ecology
of the Northern Quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), at Deakin
University, Melbourne, Australia. Part of this study is
genetically analysing quoll scats to look for the pres-
ence of amphibians, to test the hypothesis that North-
ern Quoll’s have learnt to avoid all amphibians as a
response to the long term presence of the invasive cane
toad.
I have been searching the published literature however,
I cannot ﬁnd if there is already an identiﬁed amphibian
primer. This would have to need to amplify all amphib-
ians, but not other vertebrate species. Are you aware
if this primer has been developed in the past?

Discordance in gene trees
Dear colleagues,
In bacterial data sets, discordance in gene trees can
be caused by incomplete lineage sorting, lateral gene
transfer, and others. I have a data set which repre-
sents several hundred shared orthologous genes among
40 bacterial genomes at sub-Family level. I found a
majority of gene trees disagree with each other. I know
later gene transfer has probably occurred. I want to
test whether incomplete lineage sorting has played an
important role, and whether incomplete lineage sorting
is more important than lateral gene transfer.
I would greatly appreciate if someone can give me ad-
vice about what tools/approaches I can use diﬀerenti-
ate/quantify incomplete lineage sorting and lateral gene
transfer.

DNASurveillance Carnivora
Dear EvolDir members,
The DNA Surveillance online tool now has a set of se-
quence alignments for identiﬁcation of the mammals of
the order Carnivora.
Because the reference sequences are short, the DNA
Surveillance - Carnivora is particularly suitable for
species ID of biological material containing low qual-
ity DNA (e.g. faeces, hair, museum specimens, and
sub-fossils). Additional info is available at:

Fish egg DNA
Dear all, we are trying to extract DNA for PCR am-
pliﬁcation from ﬁsh eggs (a damselﬁsh). Since the eggs
are often embedded in the sticky mucus used by the
female to lay them on the rock nests, we would like to
ﬁnd some form of chemical or enzyme that can be used
to “wash” the eggs and remove the traces of mucus that
can interfere with the isolation of clean DNA. Any tips
are welcome.
Thanks!
Stefano.

given the very numerous requests for feedback, I have
now collated below a list of answers that I got. In re-
spect of privacy, I have maintained anonymity.
Thanks again.

Hi
The problem sounds similar we had with frog eggs. Two
possible solutions if the ﬁsh eggs work like frogs eggs.
1. Suck the egg contents out with a pipette inserted
trough mucus. This is the method we used successfully
with common frogs to isolate DNA for our work
2. Get rid of the mucus with 2.6% L-cysteine. I do not
know if this works with ﬁsh mucus, but it eﬀectively
dejellied our frog eggs as described in the enclosed pa-
per.
I hope this helps,
Hi Stefano,
Have you tried extraction methods that will digest away
a lot of the PCR inhibitors? I’ve had good luck extract-
ing from snails using a standard CTAB protocol (with
a Phenol-Chloroform-Isoamyl alchohol wash).
I’m also attaching a paper that is speciﬁcally for small
tissues/ embryonic ﬁsh.. which might work.
Good luck!
Dear Stefano, how are you? Have you tried CTAB ex-
traction? That usually works quite well with “slimy
stuﬀ”.
Stephano,
I wondered if it would be useful to check with protocols
for extracting DNA from cacti and other mucilaginousDecember 1, 2011 EvolDir 61
plants. Seems that there may be protocols that get rid
of various proteins and carbohydrates in plants that are
transferable.
I think you would try PROGEMA WIZARD DNA
(salt-precipitation method) and/or DNA advance
(magnetic beads method): We use them at our lab on
diﬀerent kinds of tissues (we use the chelex INSTA-
GENE too, not recommended for tissues with too much
mucus)

For invertebrates, especially slimy ones, you can use any
derivation of the CTAB methods. This is good when
you have polysaccharides and you want to get ride of
them.
cheers
Hello Stefano,
In the past, while trying to extract DNA from slugs
(Deroceras reticulatum), that are covered in mucus, we
faced a similar problem as you describe. We success-
fully extracted DNA by using the standard technique
of digesting the tissue with proteinase K, and then us-
ing as many chloroform/phenol steps as necessary to
remove all protein and other stuﬀ from the solution.
Usually two chloroform/phenol steps were enough, and
invariably the method gave good quality DNA. Try
to remove as much mucus as possible from the eggs
(freezing them may make that easier?), and the chloro-
form/phenol steps will take care of the rest.
Hi Stefano,
You could try simple detergent. I’ve heard that can
help in snail slima etc. (never tried myself, though)
Good luck!

Hello Stephano I used cyanure potassium to wash the
jelly of amphibian eggs. Very useful, all the jelly is dis-
troyed and you obtain a clear isolated embryo. Perhapssimilar eﬀect with this kind of ﬁsh eggs best
Hi Stefano,
Probably wont be of much use but I know common
carp (among other species) farmers regularly use tan-
nin/tannic acid to ’wash’ carp eggs when using the hy-
pophysation technique to artiﬁcially spawn oﬀspring.
It removes the adhesive properties (i.e. mucus) of the
eggs thus making them easier to handle, incubate etc.
Prolonged exposure apparently damages the egg but a
quick wash would appear to be ok. May be worth a
look, sorry I cant be of more help.
hi Stefano, Prior to DNA extraction, you can add NaCl
to the tissue to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.7M, and 10%
w/v of CTAB solution, and incubated at 70 degrees C
for 10 minutes. I hope this helps.
I used to work with Stegastes partitus eggs, but never
had trouble with the chemicals in the mucus. I was do-
ing microsatellites. The eggs of this species are really
tiny. Do you ﬁnd dirty DNA?
I used the Wizard DNA extraction kit. The individual
eggs were digested whole in 100 ` ıL of Nuclei Lysis So-
lution and 2 ` ıl of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL), and the
Wizard kit protocol was scaled down by a factor of ﬁve.
I also extracted eggs using the silica-based 96-well plate
extraction protocol, from Elphinstone et al. 2003. I also
reduced the concentrations by a factor of ﬁve.
Cheers,
Stefano The relative stickiness of eggs is often related

Kin selection
Dear friends, When looking a bird and the newborns,
the mother is taking care only of these individuals. So,
she is not taking more care on these individuals than
others with less genetic relatedness, like the past oﬀ-
spring. The past newborns go away after the last repro-
duction season. But... when there is young birds actinglike helpers in the nest, the mother will take more care
on newborns and then I see kin selection here. In the
ﬁrst example, it seems to be more individual selection
and in the second more kin selection. Maybe we could
see kin selection in both cases but in the second one this
selection would be stronger? So, thinking in this way,
kin selection would be stronger when parents are deal-
ing with diﬀerent cohorts? This is just an idea and... I
would like to receive comments ple ase!
PS: Thanks for all people sending opinions since my

Milkweed reﬂectance spectra
Milkweed reﬂectance spectra?
We are studying aposematism in monarch butterﬂies,
and would like to obtain some reﬂectance spectra of
milkweed plants (Asclepias) to enable us to estimate the
conspicuousness of monarchs against a natural back-
ground. We are based in the UK, and this isn’t a good
time of year to obtain milkweed plants. Does anyone
have and would be willing to share any reﬂectance spec-
tra, please, of any milkweed species?
Many thanks, Jon Blount (University of Exeter)

Molecular dating software
Dear all,
I am looking for a molecular dating software that:
- works on a ﬁxed topology and estimates dates/node-
heights based on DNA sequences - produces a conﬁ-
dence interval for dates/node-heights - is fast (20 seq,
1kb, 1 minute)
and if possible:
- is reasonably accurate - allows partitioning of the
dataset (if applicable) - is model based - can be invoked
programmatically under linux
I would generally use BEAST, but this time the analysis
has to be repeated many times and with little super-
vision, in a sort of pipeline, hence BEAST would be
problematic.
Any help will be appreciated,
francesco

Netherlands VolunteerFieldAssist
RuﬀEvolution
*SHOREBIRDS FIELD ASSISTANT, The Nether-
lands***
Volunteers ﬁeld assistant are needed *from 10 March
to 15 May 2012* for an ongoing capture-recapture pro-
gram on the Ruﬀs, *Philomachus pugnax. *The project
is under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Theunis Piersma,
head of the Animal Ecology Group of the University of
Groningen. Our current research aims to better under-
stand demographic and ecological processes playing a
role in the ongoing decline of the Ruﬀ population us-
ing the Netherlands during migratory stopovers. The
ﬁeldwork consists in the monitoring of colour-banded
birds in Southwest Friesland, a characteristic Dutch
meadow area in the north of The Netherlands. We
collect data on the timing of migration, habitat use,
phenotype characteristics, feeding and reproductive be-
haviour of the birds; but you will also assist with the
banding of the birds, blood sampling, and data entry.
Volunteers and students involved will live together in
our ﬁeld station in a small village along the shore ofDecember 1, 2011 EvolDir 65
Lake IJsselmeer.
We are seeking highly motivated people, happy to
spend long days in the ﬁeld, social and able to work in
a team. In the same time, interested applicants should
be independent, well organized and able to maintain
a professional attitude. Good observation skills, expe-
rience with handling birds and colour-ring reading is
deﬁnitely a plus. Commitment for the all study pe-
riod and a driver license are required but command of
Dutch or Frisian is not necessary ;-) Applicants willing
to improve their spoken English are encouraged to ap-
ply (this is an excellent opportunity to improve!). But
note that a good understanding is needed.
We provide housing and ﬁeld equipment. Volunteers
must pay own airfare and food expenses (3-4 Euros per
day). A refund of ﬂight cost might be possible (depend-
ing on pending grant applications).
*To apply*: Please send a resume/CV (keep it to rele-
vant details), a cover letter (interests, career goals, rel-
evant experience for the position and availability) and
at least one reference.**
We will begin reviewing applications from 1th January
2012 and continue until position is ﬁlled.

NonNeutral SSR loci
Most analyses of population genetic variation and struc-
ture in populations assume the neutrality of the mark-
ers used. There are a number of software tools that
test for selection on loci, with LOSITAN (which uses
the It uses the FST-outlier method (Vitalis et al. 2001;Beaumont 2005) my preferred tool. In a data set of 31
microsatellite loci, as many of as six test as being sig-
niﬁcantly under either balancing or positive selection
across my samples. I would just like to get a feel for
whether the community at large, faced with such a sce-
nario, would 1) advocate dropping those loci from the
data set, 2) leaving them in or 3) presenting analyses
both with and without those loci included. My question
is asked from the standpoint of presentation in publi-

data set for my own interests in how non-neutral loci
aﬀect population genetic analyses.

NonNeutral SSR loci answers
What follows are the replies that I received to my
evoldir query regarding apparently non-neutral mi-
crosatellite loci. For privacy’s sake, I have dropped
people’s names. Thanks to all who provided responses.
My original post: “Most analyses of population genetic
variation and structure in populations assume the neu-
trality of the markers used. There are a number of
software tools that test for selection on loci, with LOSI-
TAN (which uses the It uses the FST-outlier method

ing analyses both with and without those loci included.
My question is asked from the standpoint of presenta-
tion in publication - I intend to analyze both the full
and trimmed data set for my own interests in how non-
neutral loci aﬀect population genetic analyses.”
Responses:
I would be cautious with only using the classical Fst
method (for example LOSITAN) for detecting loci
under selection. The classical methods for detection66 EvolDir December 1, 2011
of loci under selections are based on simulating a
FST-null distribution across all loci and from this
detect loci that lie outside the credibility region,
and therefore assumed to be under selection. These
methods apply a simple demographic model such as
coalescent-based approach assuming genetic drift to be
the contributor to diﬀerentiation among populations;
outliers are therefore taken as evidence of selection.
Novel methods (such as BAYESCAN ver. 2.01 (Foll
and Gaggiotti, 2008)) extent the classical approach
to include dynamic processes such as gene ﬂow are
based on detection of LD among pairs of loci. The
demographic models are more advanced and more
realistically describing ecological scenarios, includ-
ing migration among subpopulations. The degree
of diﬀerentiation (FST) decomposed into a locus ¬ −
specificcomponent (alpha ), sharedbyallpopulations, andapopulation −
specificcomponent (beta), sharedbyallloci.Selectionisassumedwhenalphaisnecessaryforexplainingtheobservedpatternofdiversity.FortestingforlociunderselectionIhaveusedbothLOSITANandBAY ESCAN, thelatterseemedtobemorerealistic, whenthepopulationstructureandhistorywastakenintoconsideration.
I guess I’d say your results are probably evidence that
the method used to identify “positive selection” is junk
(like most such methods). Almost certainly false posi-
tives...
I would look into how your loci are segregating your
samples. You could do PCAs or correspondence analy-
ses of the allele distributions among your samples and
see how they segregate for each marker, then you can
compare what your presumably neutral and what your
presumably selected markers are doing. If segregation
is the same among all markers (i.e. throughout the
genome), then I would say you do not have selection,
just some markers that are particularly good at pick-
ing the biological signal, and thus, in my opinion, all
markers should be included into the estimation of dif-
ferentiation. If you neutral markers all segregate your
samples one way, but your outlier loci do it another
(or several other ways), then you may have selection,
and I would report your neutral diﬀerentiation, and the
diﬀerentiation due to “selected” markers.
It depends on the impact on the results and the amount
of data you have. I deﬁnitely prefer to check it. Often
the impact for the ﬁnal conclusions is very limited and
can be noted verbally. (Well, dendrograms are noto-
riously instable, but one does not need them anyway.)
You might want to do some more realistic simulations
to explore other confounding factors such as sampling
from a spatially structured population, founding events
and so on.
I would suggest excluding these 6 loci since you will
have many left. I would also check what each non neu-
tral ones says. I would also check the repeat motive.
Trinucleotides are more likely to be non neutral than
dinucleotidic loci. I would also, if possible try to knowwhere these loci come from in the genome (in a coding
sequence etc...).
I would strongly recommend to at least report the out-
lier results and subsequent results with and without
them.
I would deﬁnitely analyse data with and without. In
my experience, this will likely change things. But it
might only aﬀect only some of the populations anal-
ysed (which is reasonable if any such locus is indeed
aﬀected by some local selective force speciﬁc to some
area of your study). If the loci “potentially under se-
lection” do change the picture quite a bit, you would
need to check on BLAST if they are anywhere near a
genomic region that has some functional implication.

Nonrandom sampling correction
Dear colleagues,
I have done some diversiﬁcation analyses in a group of
organisms which is undersampled and I would like to
apply a test to check if non-random sampling is bias-
ing the MCCR test results. A recent paper (Brock et
al. 2011 Syst. Biol.) describes a method to assess the
sensitivity of the MCCR test results to diﬀerent levels
of non-random sampling, the alpha NRS test, but I am
not sure how to implement it. Does anyone have an
idea on how it is implemented?
Thanks for the help.

Pest ﬂower interactions
Dear all
We are currently putting together a comprehensive re-
view on the eﬀects of ﬂowering plant food resources
(ﬂoral and extraﬂoral nectar, pollen, honeydew from
aphids on the ﬂowering plants) on adult insect pests
and their associated (hyper-)parasitoids. We are con-
sidering both lab studies, usually investigating ef-
fects of ﬂowers on pest/parasitoid survival and fe-
cundity/parasitation rate, and ﬁeld studies investigat-
ing the eﬀects of ﬂowers in ﬂower strips or as in-
tercrops/companion plants on pest/parasitoid popu-
lations. Our data base is strongest in cabbage lepi-
dopteran pests so far.
We would greatly appreciate any additional references
you might be aware of on this topic. To avoid dou-ble eﬀorts I paste a list of ﬁrst authors below, whose
publications we are aware of.
Thank you very much for your help!

Rapid evolution in everyday life
Hi folks,
I am writing an article for a general audience maga-
zine about examples of rapid evolution in the context
of our everyday lives (bodies, homes, backyards) and I
would love your thoughts on the latest examples that
you would like the people living and working around
you to know about.
Obvious general areas are antibiotic resistance and pes-
ticide resistance and rapid viral evolution but what I
would love are speciﬁc relatively well worked out exam-
ples (ideally with a citation or a contact).
My desire to write this article is prompted, in part, by
a recent conversation with a faculty member involved
in science communication who said, during a meeting,
“but there aren’t any really good examples of recent
evolution are there?” Rather than send him an email,
I thought I would write something a bit more general.
Thank you for your help. Feel free to forward this to
other folks you think might have ideas. I will share the
resulting article, but will also post links to all of the68 EvolDir December 1, 2011
papers/ideas that are forwarded along to me.
Very gratefully,
Rob

Remembering Lynn Margulis
Forwarded message from the Umass Chancellor. Sad
news.
——– Original Message ——– Subject: Remem-
bering Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University
Professor Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2011 11:02:38 -
0500 From: UMass Chancellor’s Oﬃce <oﬃcial-
chancellors@admin.umass.edu > To: massmail-
l@oit.umass.edu
To the Campus Community:
Lynn Margulis, an internationally renowned evolution-
ary biologist and one of the most prominent and distin-
guished members of the UMass Amherst faculty, died
yesterday at age 73. Her passing is a great loss for the
entire campus family.
Lynn was best known for her theory of symbiogenesis,
which challenges central tenets of neo-Darwinism. She
was also cited for her contribution to the Gaia hypoth-
esis, the concept that the Earth and its living beings
function as a self-regulating system.
She leaves us a legacy of academic accomplishment
brought about by her original thought and tireless in-
quiry into multiple ﬁeld of science that look at how the
world functions and how that magniﬁcent world has
developed over time.
Her scholarship earned an international reputation for
her as a thinker and writer dealing with complicated
ideas and complex theories. Her work brought numer-
ous accolades and awards both to her and to UMass
Amherst.
Lynn was appointed Distinguished University Professor
in 1988 and was a member of the geosciences faculty at
the time of her death. She was elected to the National
Academy of Sciences in 1983, and received the National
Medal of Science in 1999 from President Bill Clinton.Her numerous awards and honors included the 2009
Darwin-Wallace Medal, awarded at 50-year intervals
by the London-based Linnean Society for signiﬁcant
advances in the study of natural history and evolu-
tion. She also received the Nevada Medal, Sigma Xi?s
William Proctor Prize, a NASA Public Service Award,
the Miescher-Ishida Prize and the Commandeur de
l?Ordre des Palmes Academiques de France.
In 2009, she was among the seven honorees at the
Faculty Convocation who received the Award for Out-
standing Accomplishments in Research and Creative
Activity given to nationally recognized faculty mem-
bers. She previously received the Chancellor?s Medal,
the campus?s highest award for service.
As we observe Thanksgiving tomorrow, let us reﬂect on
Lynn?s contributions to UMass Amherst and the quest
for knowledge, for which we are grateful.

Software Nemo QuantiTraitLoci
v220
Nemo v2.2.0 [29 Nov 2011]
A new version of the population genetics simulation
software Nemo has been released.
In this new version, up to two genetically correlated
quantitative (phenotypic) traits can be modeled, based
on multiple pleiotropic and additive quantitative loci.
Selection on the quantitative traits can be spatially and
temporally heterogenous. Nemo2.2.0 thus allows for
the simulation of diﬀerent scenarios of local adaptation
and adaptive divergence among populations connected
by gene ﬂow, among other things.
The code released here forms the basis of work previ-
ously published in Evolution by Guillaume & Whitlock
(2007), Yeaman & Guillaume (2009), Guillaume (2011),
and Yeaman & Whitlock (2011).
Check the website for more information and down-
loads: http://nemo2.sourceforge.net If you decide to
use Nemo, please register to the mailing list, and re-
port bugs!
Happy simulations!

— What is Nemo?
Nemo is a forward-time, individual-based, genetically
explicit, and stochastic simulation program designed to
study the evolution of life history and phenotypic traits,
and population genetics in a ﬂexible (meta-)population
framework.
Nemo implements diﬀerent traits with a variety
of genetic architectures, from neutral markers (m-
sat, SNP), to deleterious mutations and quantitative
trait loci (QTL), some with sex-speciﬁc expression
(e.g., dispersal genes, female-inherited Cytoplasmic-
Incompatibility mutations, etc.).
All this is framed within a ﬂexible metapopulation
model that allows for patch-speciﬁc carrying capaci-
ties, dispersal rates, stochastic extinction/harvesting
rates, and demographic stochasticity. Populations can
be dynamically modiﬁed during a simulation, allowing
for population bottlenecks, patch fusion/ﬁssion, pop-
ulation expansion, etc. Selection on the quantitative
traits can also vary during the course of a simulation
and among the demes within a population.
The life cycle is also ﬂexible, with many diﬀerent events
that can be included when needed (reproduction, mi-
gration, selection, crossing, regulation, etc.). Nemo also
oﬀers the possibility to output many diﬀerent statistics
recorded during simulation runs.
— What is the diﬀerence with quantiNEMO?
quantiNEMO (Neuenschwander et al. 2008) also imple-
ments quantitative traits. Its implementation is how-
ever based on a diﬀerent mutation model (i.e., discrete
number of alleles per locus versus continuum-of-allele
model) and does not allow for pleiotropic loci. quan-
tiNEMO thus doesn’t oﬀer the possibility to model ge-
netically correlated traits. The model however allows
for epistatic interactions among loci.
quantiNEMO is based on an older version of Nemo (pre-
2.1.0) from which it implements the dispersal models,
neutral trait, and the metapopulation framework, while
improving some aspects of those elements. It how-
ever does not implement the most recent improvements
brought into Nemo.

TimeSeries MicroarrayData
My research group is having trouble analyzing unevenly
sampled microarray time series data. We are using
the Meltzerlab GEO Microarray tool search for our re-
search, and there are some samples that are unevenly
distributed for some time points. For example, GDS63
(GDS accession number) has 5 microarray datasets at
the time point of 3 days, whereas there are 14 of mi-
croarray datasets at the time point of 7 days. The lit-
erature does not explain how the authors analyzed the
uneven samples, and we are wondering if there is any
software/ algorithms/ protocol that enables researchers
to compare the samples. It would be really great if we
can get some inputs for this issues.

HumanPopulationGeneticsHealth Canada and the Public Health Agency are
studying the associations among genetic polymor-
phisms in folate and B vitamin metabolic genes, di-
etary folate intake and folate status in the Canadian
population. We are looking for someone with expe-
rience in genetics, especially population genetics and
with an interest in the application of population genet-
ics in public health and nutrition. The position would
be for 1 year with the possibility to renew for one addi-
tional year. Please refer to the NSERC Visiting Fellow-
ship application website to determine your eligibility to
apply. If you are interested, please contact Amanda
MacFarlane at amanda.macfarlane@hc-sc.gc.ca . Ap-
plications should be submitted soon. Please ﬁnd a
general project description below. The modifying ef-
fect of genetic polymorphisms involved in folate and
B12 metabolism on the relationship between folate/B12
intake and vitamin status Folic acid (FA) supplemen-
tation in the peri-conceptional period prevents neural
tube defects (NTDs), including spina biﬁda. Health
Canada (HC) recommends that women of childbear-
ing age take a supplement containing 0.4mg FA/day.
Despite signiﬁcant public health promotion, only a mi-
nority of these women take FA supplements. Therefore,
HC mandated the addition of FA to white ﬂour in 1998
to increase intake in this target population. However, it
has also resulted in exposure of the general population
to unprecedented levels of FA. While HC&rsquo;s cur-
rent policies have led to a signiﬁcant reduction of NTDs
in Canada, almost one quarter of women of childbear-
ing age still have levels below optimal for signiﬁcant
reduction in NTD risk. Conversely, approximately 40%
of the Canadian population has a high folate status
indicative of excessive dietary intake of FA. There is
accumulating evidence linking high FA intake with in-
creased risk for some cancers, anemia, cognitive decline
and other chronic diseases. Our goal is to identify ge-
netic signatures that are associated with hypo- or hy-
per responsiveness to dietary FA intake, as indicated
by folate status. B12 metabolism is inextricably re-
lated to and signiﬁcantly impacts folate metabolism.
Therefore, we will devise a method to relate usual FA
and B12 dietary intake with folate and B12 status from
data collected in the Canadian Health Measures Survey.
Genes associated with folate and B12 metabolism will
be sequenced to identify gene variants associated with
aberrant folate and B12 status as it relates to dietary
intake. This will be the ﬁrst study to identify individu-
als within the Canadian population that may be genet-
ically susceptible to the eﬀects of FA over-consumption.

CrustaceanGeneticVariation
POSTDOC WANTED with interest in
Genetic variation of model taxa of crustaceans and their
associated (micro)parasites
A funding for one junior post doc (less than 3 years
since acquiring PhD) is available for 34 months start-
ing in April 2012, in the group of Adam Petrusek at the
Department of Ecology, Charles University in Prague.
The research of the group focuses mostly on diversity,
evolution, and ecology of two groups of crustaceans
cladocerans (mainly Daphnia) and freshwater crayﬁsh.
Furthermore, we are interested in interactions of these
crustaceans, as hosts, with certain microparasites (in
particular, an oomycete Aphanomyces astaci causing
crayﬁsh plague, and microsporidians infecting Daph-
nia). In our projects, we collaborate with a number of
groups in various European countries.
The postdoc who will join our group should contribute
to these research questions by genetic analyses of pop-
ulations of selected crustacean species complexes, fo-
cusing on questions such as spatial distribution of evo-
lutionary lineages and phylogroups, patterns on inter-
speciﬁc hybridisation between coexisting related taxa,
impacts of parasitism on genetic variation of host pop-
ulations, etc. Variety of molecular approaches is likely
to be used, such as standard sequencing, microsatel-
lite analyses, DNA-based pathogen detection (includ-
ing real-time PCR), or AFLP. The exact topics of the
postdoc project will be speciﬁed based on the know-
how and interests of the candidate, and might be either
cladoceran- or crayﬁsh biased; however, he/she is ex-
pected to work with both groups of models, and master
additional methods. To facilitate this, funding for two
3-month stays of the postdoc with collaborating groups
in other European countries is secured.
The ideal candidate for this position has strong back-
ground in animal ecology and evolutionary biology (an
experience with host-parasite interactions is a plus),
has experience with various DNA laboratory methods
and analysis of resulting data, and is willing to learn
new methods and contribute to both ﬁeld- and labwork.
Furthermore, the postdoc is expected to organise one
workshop a year for students and academic personnel
out of Prague, for transfer the know-how. Good knowl-
edge of written and spoken English is essential for can-didate of any nationality (this language is fully suﬃ-
cient for living in Prague and working at the depart-
ment). The department has suitable facilities for the
DNA work in a recently refurbished lab, access to well-
equipped genomic and proteomic service labs, and a
stimulating working environment within a young team.
The building where the department is located is in the
historical centre of Prague, within the UNESCO World
Heritage area.
The gross salary of the postdoc is 40.000 Czk/month (ca
1600 EUR), and may increase based on his/her achieve-
ments during the project (note that living expenses in
the Czech Republic are generally lower than in Western
European countries.)
If interested, send a letter of interest outlining your past
research, motivation for this position and speciﬁc expe-
rience (max. 2 pages), CV, list of peer-reviewed publi-
cations, abstract of PhD thesis, and contact details of
2-3 senior scientists who may provide a reference in a
single (!) PDF ﬁle to petrusek@cesnet.cz. Note that
only those who ﬁnished the PhD since February 2009
are eligible! Pre-selected candidates will be asked to
submit their applications through a formal university
selection procedure, and invited for an interview.

BioinformaticsTranscriptomics
*CNRS France Bioinformatics transcriptomics*
We are opening a postdoctoral position to work on a
collaborative project between the Station of Experi-
mental Ecology of the CNRS (French National Center
for Scientiﬁc Research) and the Bioinformatics Plate-
form of the Genome Center in Toulouse (Plateforme
GenoToul Bioinfo), France. The position is available
for one year, renewable once.
The research developed at the Station of Experimen-
tal Ecology ( http://www.ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr/ ) aims to
understand the impact of environmental changes (e.g.,
climate change) on natural populations, using species
such as butterﬂies and lizards as model systems. In to-
day’s rapidly evolving landscapes, we expect dispersal
to play a particularly crucial role in allowing organ-
isms to cope with changing environmental conditions,
yet how, and how rapidly organisms may respond to
selection on mobility remains currently unknown. Our76 EvolDir December 1, 2011
aim is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying the adaptive responses of organisms to in-
creased selective pressures on mobility, in order to de-
velop more realistic predictive models of population dy-
namics and species persistence.
The bioinformatics plateform is one of 12 plate-
forms of the Genome Center in Toulouse ( http://-
bioinfo.genotoul.fr/ ), which assists research teams with
data processing and data storage, and provides access
to generalist and specialist data banks and bioinformat-
ics software.
The postdoctoral position oﬀered is funded by a French
ANR grant obtained to better understand variations in
the locomotor abilities of lizards, butterﬂies and frogs
using genomic, transcriptional, physiological and eco-
logical approaches. To do so, we will be sequencing the
transcriptomes of the lizard (/Lacerta vivipara/) and
the butterﬂy (/Pieris brassicae/) using 454 technology,
to use as references in future genomic studies. The suc-
cessful candidate will work in close collaboration with
both teams at the Station of Experimental Ecology and
at the Bioinformatics Plateform and will be in charge
of the assembly of the sequence data, identiﬁcation of
SNPs associated with phenotypic variation, and poten-
tially, gene expression analyses of RNA seq data.
In addition, the successful candidate will be in charge
of analyzing and interpreting results, and will also be
involved in the writing of research reports and scientiﬁc
papers.
Ideal candidates will have a Ph.D. in transcriptomics,
bioinformatics, or other relevant ﬁeld, proven research
experience and a strong publication record.Candidates
should be comfortable working in a UNIX environment,
have a strong programming background, be proﬁcient
in working with large datasets and have solid analytical,
computing and statistical skills.
To apply for these positions, please send an email
with a single collated PDF including (1) CV, (2)
names and contact information of three references, (3)
statement of research interests, to Michel Baguette
(baguette@mnhn.fr) by January 15, 2012. The posi-
tion is expected to start in April/May 2012.

Project description : Brent geese Branta bernicla are
highˆ aarctic breeding birds that feed extensively on in-
tertidal mudﬂats outside the breeding season, where
they graze on eelgrass Zostera spec. Eelgrass beds are
a restricted and endangered habitat around the world.
After the decline of eelgrass beds in the Dutch Wadden
Sea, the brent goose population initially collapsed, but
recovered later due to conservation actions and a habi-
tatˆ aswitch towards lower salt marsh vegetations and
agricultural ﬁelds. Recently, the population has de-
clined again due to a long series of poor breeding years.
Brent geese were among the ﬁrst migratory species for
which it was shown that spring conditions in the tem-
perate region carried over to breeding performance in
the arctic. Recent evidence suggests that the quality of
wintering and stopover sites may be vitally important
to population processes in migrants. In this project,
we aim to investigate the importance of nonˆ abreeding
habitats, and eelgrass beds in particular, for brent goose
population dynamics and individual ﬁtness, relative to
the importance of alternative habitats, the role of com-
petition with the closely related barnacle goose Branta
leucopsis, and other factors. The postdoc will analyse

A three year postdoctoral fellowship is available to in-
vestigate the adaptive variation, environmental gradi-
ents and demography in Mediterranean conifers. The
study organisms will be Pinus pinaster, Pinus halepen-
sis and Taxus baccata. For this project, we are com-
bining diﬀerent approaches to investigate the evolu-
tionary response of these conifers to selection: demo-
graphic dynamics, patterns of adaption at the pheno-
typic and molecular levels, and modeling of the climatic
niche. More speciﬁcally, the candidate will be involved
in assessing the patterns of adaptation at the phe-
notypic and molecular levels by identifying functional
genes responsible for variation in phenotypic traits and
geographical-climatic clines of adaptive variation.
The successful candidate will have experience with
population genetics and genomics, especially with se-
quences and SNPs analysis. The candidate should hold
a Ph.D. in genetics or evolutionary biology, have an ex-
cellent academic and publication record, and be a ﬂuent
speaker/writer in English. We seek an individual who
is enthusiastic, highly motivated, and willing to work
independently as well as with a team.
This project is a collaboration between the Center
of Forest Research (CIFOR) at the National Insti-
tute of Research and Agrarian and Food Technol-
ogy (INIA) in Madrid ( www.inia.es ), and the Cen-
ter for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications

UCalifornia Davis AntGenetics
Post-doc position in the spatial genetics and ecology of
acacia-ants in Kenya The Stanton and Grosberg labs,
Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of
California Davis
We are seeking a highly motivated post-doc with ex-
pertise in spatial genetic analysis, an interest in using
genetics to inform ﬁeld experiments and surveys, and
the ability to work up to 4 months per year at one of
Africa’s most spectacular ﬁeld research centers.
Over the past twelve years, our team of colleagues at
the Mpala Research Centre in Kenya has probed deeply
into the ecological dynamics of a multi-species mutual-
ism in which four species of acacia-ants associate with a
single, dominant acacia, A. drepanolobium in highland
savannas around East Africa. The relative ease with
which ﬁeld manipulations can be conducted in this sys-
tem, in concert with its amazingly rich natural history,
has resulted in a number of high-proﬁle publications,
and new insights into the dynamics of competition and
coexistence among the symbiont ant species, the role
of mega-herbivores in maintaining the mutualism, and
the non-additive ﬁtness consequences for long-lived host
trees that associate with multiple species over their life-
time. For links to recent papers and some of the work in
progress, please refer to the beautiful website of our pal
and collaborator extraordinaire, Todd Palmer ( http:/-
/web.mac.com/toadpalmer/Site/welcome.html ).
The new post-doc will lead a relatively new research
eﬀort, in which we are focusing on three congeneric
acacia-ant species that coexist at very ﬁne spatial scales
around the Mpala area Crematogaster sjostedti, C. mi-
mosae, and C. nigriceps. These species vary dramat-
ically in ecology, life-history and apparent colony dy-
namics. Large, multi-queen, multi-tree colonies of C.
sjostedti dominate in competition for host trees over
smaller (sometimes multi-queen) colonies of C. mi-
mosae, which in turn can competitively displace the
single-queen colonies of C. nigriceps. The focus of our
current project is to determine what role spatial pat-
terns of within-colony and between-colony genetic vari-
ation may play in colony success in competition for food
sources and host trees, colony establishment, the bal-
ance between intra- versus inter-speciﬁc competition,
and on the ability of these intensely competing species
to coexist system. Multiple microsatellite loci havebeen developed in two of the three species thus far,
and patterns of variation at these loci identify colony
structures that correspond closely with those obtained
from ﬁeld aggression assays.
So, if you are, like us, someone who is driven to solve
mysteries, here is just a small sample of observations
we’ve made and questions we hope to address in this
work.
*Bigger colonies have a competitive advantage, but at-
taining large colony size requires multiple queens. To
what extent are large colonies less genetically integrated
than single-queen colonies? Does polygyny pre-dispose
a colony to reduced cooperation or fragmentation? If
not, how is colony integrity and cooperation main-
tained?
** Colonies of the diﬀerent species are spatially aggre-
gated that is, conspeciﬁc colonies are more often near
neighbors than expected by chance. To what extent are
conspeciﬁc neighbors also related to one another? How
do genetically related neighboring colonies arise?
** Do neighboring colonies of the same species compete
as often and as intensively as heterospeciﬁc neighbors?
To what extent are levels of intraspeciﬁc, inter-colony
aggression determined by genetic relatedness?
Here are the attributes we are seeking in the person
who will ﬁll this position. 1) Strong skills in writing
and in transforming data into manuscripts and research
proposals. 2) Experience in development of microsatel-
lites and in analysis of microsats or other hyper-variable
genetic markers using multiple software packages. 3)
Experience in the design and execution of large-scale
ﬁeld experiments. 4) Good mentoring and organiza-
tional skills, with an ability to organize and supervise
lab groups and research teams. 5) High levels of respon-
sibility and self-motivation for independent work. 6)
Experience with mapping and spatial analysis in GIS.
7) Experience and interest in ant or other haplodiploid
social insects is a plus, but not essential.
UC Davis is an extraordinarily stimulating and fertile
environment for post-doctoral work in all aspects of
evolutionary ecology. While on campus, the post-doc
will have oﬃce and lab space in Storer Hall, home to
both the Department of Ecology and the Center for
Population Biology. We anticipate that the post-doc
will make two trips per year to the Mpala Research Cen-
tre in Kenya, which hosts a stimulating international
community of biologists and ecosystem scientists. This
post-doc position is renewable for up to three years.

the Phylogenetics and Computational Genomics lab of
Dr. Sagi Snir.
Next Generation Sequencing has opened up unprece-
dented opportunities for researches from the quantita-
tive sciences. Genomic sequences of enormous quanti-
ties are available for all sort of advanced biological anal-
ysis. Analytical skills beyond the traditional biological
training are imprative. The positions are targeted to
two projects:
1. The project is focused on large scale phylogenet-
ics reconstruction by means of the supertree method.
The project is based on algorithmic and computa-
tional/mathematical tools for piecing together the tree
of life. We represent trees in a special graph and ap-
ply speciﬁc graph algorithms such as MaxCut on this
graph. Preliminary results show advantages over ex-
isting methods. As these tasks are computationallyDecember 1, 2011 EvolDir 91
hard, we employ probabilistic approaches to obtain the
results. We investigate both theoretical and practical
questions associated with this approach.
2. Detection and analysis of horizontal gene trans-
fer (HGT) in prokaryotes. HGT is a major factor in
prokaryotic evolution and plays a signiﬁcant role in de-
veloping antibiotic resistance. We have developed sev-
eral novel methods to detect HGT where existing meth-
ods fail. The methods use evolutionary signals, unique
to HGT, that are detected by non trivial statistical ap-
proaches.
Both projects are funded by highly competitive grants
that provide high fellowships. Outstanding candidates
from both exact and life sciences are encouraged to ap-
ply. Qualiﬁed candidates will earn very high salaries.
Familiarity with computational/mathematical biology
is favourable. Essential requirements include pro-
ﬁciency in computer-programming skills, such as
C/C++/Java and scripting languages (e.g. Perl, Phy-
ton), demonstrated ability in applying the devised al-
gorithms.
The Institute of Evolution is world leading in broad as-
pects of evolution, both theoretical and practical. The
young team of Dr. Snir is characterized by works with
both algorithmic and evolutionary appeal with ample
collaboration with other leading labs around the world.

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP - ZOOPLANK-
TON MOLECULAR ECOLOGY University of Hawaii
at Manoa Department of Oceanograph Applications are
invited for a postdoctoral fellowship position in zoo-
plankton molecular ecology in E. Goetze’s laboratory in
the Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii,
at Manoa.
The postdoctoral scientist will lead eﬀorts in nuclear
marker development for an NSF-funded project on pop-
ulation connectivity and dispersal in oceanic plank-ton species. The project aims to test the hypothe-
sis that depth habitat and vertical migration behavior
are keys traits that inﬂuence dispersal and gene ﬂow
among plankton populations in open ocean habitats.
Our approach is comparative, and we are working to
resolve the spatial patterns of gene ﬂow among popu-
lations of eight copepod species that utilize very dif-
ferent depth habitats (surface 1000 m) The postdoc’s
primary responsibilities on this project will be to (1)
develop new microsatellite (or RAD tag) markers for
1-2 planktonic copepods, and (2) apply these markers
across a global collection of material (Atlantic, Paciﬁc,
and Indian Oceans; subtropical and tropical waters).
454 sequencing will be used for marker development,
and applicants with skills in handling these datasets are
particularly desired. If interested, opportunities would
exist to participate in ﬁeldwork at sea, gain university
teaching experience at the graduate and undergradu-
ate levels, attend training workshops, and obtain ex-
perience in writing research grants. Support will be
provided to present research results at national or in-
ternational meetings. Initial appointment is for 1 year.
The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Tech-
nology (SOEST) was established at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa to promote excellence in interdisci-
plinary research and graduate education in marine, at-
mospheric, and geological sciences. This postdoctoral
position is within the Department of Oceanography at
SOEST, and is located on the main Manoa campus.
Additional information about the Biological Oceanog-
raphy Division and the Department of Oceanogra-
phy can be found at: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/-
oceanography/ . Qualiﬁcations: The successful candi-
date will have a PhD in oceanography, marine biology,
zoology or a related ﬁeld, and strong molecular skills.
While not required, ideal candidates will have experi-
ence with nuclear marker development in other organ-
isms, and will have some experience with handling large
genetic datasets (from 454 or Illumina platforms).
How to apply: Electronically submit a coverletter, CV,
brief statement of research experience and interests,
and names and contact information for three references
to egoetze@hawaii.edu. Review of applications will be-
gin on November 4, 2011 and will continue until a suit-
able candidate is found. An ideal start date would be in

EvolutionaryEcologyGenetics
Postdoc position in evolutionary ecology / evolutionary
genetics Rundle lab, Department of Biology, University
of Ottawa
I am looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow
with a keen interest in evolutionary ecology and/or evo-
lutionary genetics. Although project(s) are ﬂexible and
could compliment various research in my lab ( http://-
mysite.science.uottawa.ca/hrundle ), I am especially in-
terested in those with a background and interest in one
or more of the following:
1) life history studies of antler ﬂies (Protopiophila lit-
igate) in the wild (in collaboration with R. Bonduri-
ansky, UNSW). This is a powerful model system in
which it’s possible to come very close to measuring
male lifetime ﬁtness in undisturbed populations in na-
ture, and manipulative lab experiments are also fea-
sible, providing great potential to study the dynam-
ics of life history traits, sexual selection, senescence,
condition-dependence, etc.
2) genetic drift and its eﬀects on genetic covariance
structure, the subsequent response to selection, and the
evolution of reproductive isolation using experimental
evolution in Drosophila serrata.
3) manipulative tests of the conditions favouring the
evolution of sex in the ﬁlamentous fungus Aspergillus
nidulans (with S. Schoustra, Wageningen University
and R. Kassen, uOttawa).
Good communication and interpersonal skills, a strong94 EvolDir December 1, 2011
work ethic, and the ability to think creatively and crit-
ically are also assets.
The position is for two years, comes with a compet-
itive salary, and the start date is ﬂexible. Applica-
tions should include a cover letter, a curriculum vitae,
a short ( ~1 page) description of research interests, and
the names and contact information (including e-mail) of
two referees. All application materials should be sub-
mitted via email, as a single pdf, to Howard Rundle
(hrundle@uottawa.ca), to whom queries may also be
addressed. Evaluation of applications will begin imme-
diately and continue until the position is ﬁlled.

UOulu EvolutionInformationUse
A postdoctoral position, funded by the Academy of Fin-
land, available at the Department of Biology, University
of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.
Accumulating evidence suggest that information is
ﬂowing among conspeciﬁc and heterospeciﬁc individ-uals but very little is known about its ecological and
evolutionary eﬀects. Our research team have demon-
strated that interspeciﬁc information use aﬀects impor-
tant decisions, such as where to breed, how much invest
in oﬀspring and which behavioral traits to copy (e.g.,
Current Biology 17:1248-, Ecology 88:1622-, Proc. R.
Soc. B 278:1736-), but many novel research questions
are still awaiting further exploration.
The current research project can be built on diﬀerent
themes or combination of them depending on the skills
and interests of the candidate. One of the main aims
is to examine dispersal and breeding site selection of
birds relative to presence and performance of con- and
heterospeciﬁcs using a comprehensive long-term data
base. Experimental ﬁeld work is also possible using resi-
dent titmice and migratory ﬂycatchers as model species.
Field work will take place either in Oulu, or on the is-
land of Gotland, in Sweden. Interspeciﬁc information
use challenges many predictions of the traditional theo-
ries and provides many exciting and novel questions for
theoretical examination. Studies will be done in collab-
oration with researchers from Lyon (France), Uppsala
(Sweden), and Helsinki (Finland).
Applications and requirements: Minimum qualiﬁca-
tions include a PhD in ecology, evolutionary or com-
munity ecology or related ﬁeld and interest in social
information use, and habitat selection. Good English
speaking and writing skills are mandatory. Ideal can-
didate is a conﬁdent and independent scientist and has
a good track record in publishing in leading journals.
S/he also should have a strong background in analyz-
ing large spatial and temporal data sets. An interest
and skills for theoretical studies is a beneﬁt, but not
necessary.
The start of the position is ﬂexible, but should prefer-
ably not be later than March 2012. Funding is available
for 12 months with a possibility for an extension of 6-12
months. The salary will be based on the levels 5-6 of
the demand level chart for Finnish universities and also
is aﬀected by the ’personal work performance, and will
be 3300-3900 euros/month, including full health care
beneﬁts.
Interested applicants should email a statement of re-
search interest, a full CV, and names and contact in-
formation of three academic referees (in pdf format) to
Jukka Forsman (jukka.forsman@oulu.ﬁ). Initial consid-
eration of applicants start on December 9th, 2011, and
position is open until a suitable candidate is found.
Informal enquiries are welcome (jukka.forsman@oulu.ﬁ,

We are using as study models two adaptive radiations
in oceanic island ﬁnches: the Tristan buntings and the
Gulf of Guinea seedeaters. The study models have been
chosen for their simplicity and because molecular and
ecological data indicate that selection has played a ma-
jor role in the diversiﬁcation of these systems.
English is the working language at CIBIO.
AIM. The candidate will hold the important role of co-
ordinating and supervising the handling and analysis
of genomic data produced by diﬀerent research teams

bility of contributing in the assembly and annotation of
the genome of one of the model species. The candidate
should be available to participate in student supervi-
sion and in paper writing-up. Besides the willingness
to work within this collaboration, the successful appli-
cant will be encouraged to develop his/her own research
lines within the project framework.
QUALIFICATIONS. Applicants must hold a PhD in a
quantitative ﬁeld (e.g., bioinformatics, computational
biology, statistics) or have a research record in this
area. An interest in population genetics and speciation
is desirable. Preference will be given to candidates with
experience in comparative/population/evolutionary ge-
nomics (e.g., database mining; analyses of genetic and
genomic diﬀerentiation; detection of selection; genetic
expression analyses; SNP detection; analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data). Candidates with an evo-
lutionary biology background and experience in quanti-
tative analyses who are keen to take their research intothe bioinformatics ﬁeld are also welcome to apply. The
candidate must be willing to work closely with a large
number of researchers that are part of an international
collaborative network (Portugal, South Africa, Sweden,

Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
playing an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecological communities. The estimation of
phylogenetic trees is now a formalized statistical prob-
lem with general agreement on the central issues and
questions. A nearly standard set of topics is now taught
as part of the curriculum at many colleges and univer-102 EvolDir December 1, 2011
sities. On the other hand, application of phylogenetic
methods to novel problems outside systematics is an
area of special excitement, innovation, and controversy,
and perspectives vary widely.
This Spring, for the thirteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-
vances in phylogenetic methodology, and then focuses
on methods and tools that can be brought to bear on
these applied issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labo-
ratory on the Northern California coast, which has ex-
tensive computing resources and on-site housing. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, discus-
sion, and hands-on software training. One afternoon
during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips to local
natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Estimating, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees
* Recent advances in Bayesian and Maximum-
likelihood estimation of phylogeny
* Estimation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree
conﬂicts
* Divergence-time estimation from sequence data: re-
laxed clocks, fossil calibration
* Analysis of character evolution: maximum likelihood
and Bayesian approaches, ancestral-state estimation,
character correlation, rates of trait evolution
* Analysis of morphological form, function of complex
character systems
* Inference of diversiﬁcation rates: detecting rate shifts,
testing key innovation hypotheses
* Model speciﬁcation issues: model selection, adequacy
and uncertainty
* Diagnosing MCMC performance
Instructors for the 2012 workshop
* Jeremy Brown * Brian Moore
* Jonathan Eisen * Samantha Price
* Rich Glor * Bruce Rannala* Tracy Heath * Bob Thomson
* John Huelsenbeck * Peter Wainwright
Plus special guest lecturers!!
Prerequisites. Available housing limits course enroll-
ment to ~30 students. Preference is given to doctoral
candidates who are in the early to middle stages of their
thesis research, and who have completed suﬃcient pre-
requisites (through previous coursework or research ex-
perience) to provide some familiarity with phylogenetic
methods. Unfortunately, because of limits on class size,
postdocs and faculty are discouraged from applying.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $650. This includes
room and board at BML for duration of the course (ar-
riving March 10, leaving March 17) and transportation
from Davis to BML.
Application Deadline. Applications are due by Jan-
uary 9, 2012. Please send a completed application

France Metabarcoding
Dear All,
In the context of the european project EcoChange,
the Laboratoire d’Ecologie Alpine (LECA) organizes
a spring school about DNA Metabarcoding applied to
biodiversity assessment and diet analysis.
Many ecological questions rely on the knowledge of the
list of species involved in the studied process. Tack-
ling this demand using standard methods (botanical
relev´ es, micro-histology, palynology) is often a diﬃcult
task that relies on highly qualiﬁed persons. DNA bar-
coding has proposed to use short standardized genomic
sequences (barcode) as a character in taxonomical iden-tiﬁcation. DNA Metabarcoding use the same principle
that associate DNA sequences to taxa for estimating
biodiversity of an environmental sample. As all liv-
ing organism spread cells in their environment, a PCR
amplicon obtained with adequate primers from the to-
tal DNA extracted from an environmental sample can
be consider as a mirror of the biodiversity present in
the environment. The pertinent choice of the primer
pair allows to focus on a speciﬁc group as, for exam-
ple, plants. Then the sequencing of a large number of
individual DNA molecules of the PCR amplicon using
next generation sequencer allows to establish a list of
taxa present in the sample. Depending of the sample
(e.g. soil, water, permafrost, feces), DNA metabarcod-
ing can be applied to many ecological studies such as
plant community analysis, past ecosystem reconstruc-
tion, or diet assessment.
We propose a spring school including lectures and
practical sessions on metabarcoding. This school is
open for twenty participants (students, postdocs, or re-
searchers).
Please visit http://metabarcoding.org for more infor-
mation.
Applications including a short CV and a
short motivation letter should be sent to

OhioStateU SpeciesTrees Jan13-14Workshop at the Ohio State University, Jan 13-14, 2012
Estimating Species Trees: a Phylogenetic Paradigm for
the 21st Century
Recentcomputational and modeling advances have pro-
duced methods for estimating species trees directly. Ac-
curateestimates of phylogenetic relationships can be ex-
tracted from genetic data with these new approaches,
sometimes with less data, by directly modeling the
causes of discordance in topology and branch lengths
among gene trees. Such inferences are commonly im-
possible under the traditional phylogenetic paradigm
because of the potential for the idiosyncrasies of gene
trees to obscure the actual history of species divergence.
We are oﬀering this workshop to not only increase the
visibility and use of these methods, but also address a
number of signiﬁcant challenges to estimating species
trees, to assure that the advantages these methods of-
fer reach a broad community of users. The goals of the
workshop are to: (i) provide an understanding of the
theoretical underpinnings of current methodology, (ii)

Course description This course on Landscape Genet-
ics provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary
training and provides an overview of the ﬁeld of land-
scape genetics. The course caters to students in
both basic and applied ecology, especially conserva-
tion/population genetics, landscape ecology and con-
servation biology. A key objective of landscape genet-
ics is to study how landscape modiﬁcation and habi-
tat fragmentation aﬀect organism dispersal and gene
ﬂow across the landscape. Landscape genetics requires
highly interdisciplinary specialized skills making inten-
sive use of technical population genetic skills and spatial
analysis tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools and remote
sensing). Even when students receive disciplinary train-
ing in these areas, educational programs often lack the
necessary linkage and synthesis among disciplines. This
linkage can only be accomplished after experts from
each discipline work together to develop guiding prin-
ciples for this new research area. Landscape Genetics
will be concurrently oﬀered at six universities in North
America and Europe giving students the opportunity to
learn from international experts and work with peers
from outside institutions. For students who are not
members of the participating institutions, we are of-106 EvolDir December 1, 2011
fering a web-based online course to reach a broader
audience. Each course meeting will start with a live
web-cast lecture (no special software required) by an
expert on the topic that introduces foundations and
methods and highlights points for discussion in local
seminar groups. After breaking out into local course
group discussion (including a discussion group for on-
line course students), a web-based discussion across
campuses will wrap up the weekly topic. Students who
are unable to make it to live-cast of lectures and need
to view taped lectures should contact the course co-
ordinators to make special arrangements. In addition,
students may choose to participate in optional interdis-
ciplinary group team projects with web-based collabo-
ration across institutions. Course topics - Landscape
genetics framework, Measuring gene ﬂow, Alternative
views of landscapes - Spatial analysis framework, Iden-
tifying discrete populations - Incorporating landscape
data, Matrix resistance approaches in landscape genet-
ics - Distance-based methods, Model selection and val-
idation - Role of simulation modeling, Network-based
methods - Landscape genetics of adaptive variation
How to register? Contact Lisette Waits,
lwaits@uidaho.edu to register for the class.
Note: University credit will not be provided but stu-
dents who need course credit can set up an independent
study course at their home institution and turn in spe-
ciﬁc assignments during the semester. Contact Lisette
Waits if you are interested in this option.Funding provided by the American Genetics Associa-
tion and Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution
(CIEE)
Related American Genetic Association (AGA) and
CIEE sponsored Graduate Mini-Course in May 2012
After the course, project participants may decide to
continue working on the group research project for
another term with the aim of writing a collaborative
manuscript for publication. With support from AGA
and CIEE a Graduate Mini-Course (not for credit) will
be held near Toronto, Canada, May 20 ’ 26, 2012 to pro-
mote intensive collaboration on manuscripts and pro-
vide professional networking opportunities. Participa-
tion in the Landscape Genetics Course and in a group
term project are prerequisites for the AGA-CIEE Grad-
uate Mini-Course, and participants will be selected pri-
marily based on the merit of their application and con-
tribution to the group project.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plainDecember 1, 2011 EvolDir 107
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
