The National Institute of General Medical Sciences,
NIH, DHHS, is hosting a symposium entitled Evolution
of Infectious Disease, July 13-15, 2005, in Bethesda,
MD at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Bethesda.
The meeting will begin with a reception on the evening
of July 13, and the scientiﬁc presentations will begin
the morning of July 14. The meeting organizers, Dr.
Howard Ochman and Dr. Holly Wichman, have sched-
uled outstanding presentations on new research in the
ﬁeld and made sure there is ample time throughout the
meeting for conversation and discussion.
The meeting agenda focuses on understanding basic
principles of evolution using infectious diseases as mod-
els and employing knowledge from computational sci-
ences and mathematics in addition to infectious dis-
ease biology. This symposium will be an opportunity
to share knowledge and resources and to deﬁne impor-
tant questions for future interdisciplinary research in
the ﬁeld.

This is to let people know that the timetable of talks
for this symposium, and the selected talks, should nowJuly 1, 2005 EvolDir 3
(or soon) be on the meeting web site.
Our ’symposium’ was heavily over-attended, but the
organisers kindly gave us an extra allocation of time,
so we now have two sessions planned, on both Friday
(August 19th) and on the Saturday morning. However,
there was still not enough time in the schedule to in-
clude the many very interesting talks that were oﬀered.
We apologise to those who are disappointed, but the
good thing about this situation is that there is a large
number of very interesting posters as well as talks, and
there should be good opportunities for discussions of
topics in genome evolution, so we do hope that people
who had hoped to give a talk will still be willing to
come and show a poster instead.
If anyone listed to give a talk does not wish to give a
talk after all, we would be grateful if they would email
me (DC, email below) as soon as possible, as we should
like to oﬀer their time slot to someone else.

UEastAnglia phylogenetic theory
PhD-studentship at The University of East Anglia,
Norwich, United Kingdom
Starting date: autumn 2005
Extending the theory behind phylogenetic inference
Drug resistant superbugs such as MSRA and novel vir-
ulent pathogens such as SARS or bird ﬂu are just a
few examples of potentially lethal organisms that have
recently dominated the headlines. Although fundamen-
tally diﬀerent in nature a feature shared by all of them
is that they have arisen relatively recently via complex
evolutionary processes such as e.g. lateral gene trans-
fer and recombination. An improved understanding of
such processes may therefore hold the key for eﬀective
drug development strategies.8 EvolDir July 1, 2005
Traditionally, evolution has been assumed to be tree-
like making a (graph theoretical) tree the model of
choice. However, by its very nature, a tree cannot ap-
propriately represent the intertwined evolutionary past
of organisms such as the ones mentioned above. The
need to better understand the netted character of evo-
lution coupled with improved insight into the com-
plex processes that drive evolution has led to the in-
troduction of the novel concept of a phylogenetic net-
work into phylogenetics – a young and ﬂourishing area
concerned with providing a theoretical framework for
studying evolution. Recently, these structures have re-
ceived a considerable amount of attention in the lit-
erature from mathematicians, computer scientists and
biologists alike.
The main thrust of this interdisciplinary project is to
take on some of the challenges involved in extending the
theory behind phylogenetic inference. It will draw on
the supervisor’s expertise and is expected to result in
novel approaches plus software for constructing phylo-
genetic networks. In close collaboration with biologists
the resulting methods will be assessed and compared
with other phylogenetic inference techniques.
The project will by supervised by Dr. Katharina Hu-
ber ( www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/people/faculty/kth ), School
of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia, Nor-
wich, United Kingdom.
Students interested in this PhD-studentship should
have excellent programming skills, a good background
in theoretical computer sciences and/or mathematics
and an interest in biology.

UHelsinki MetacommunityDynamics
POST GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP IN METACOM-
MUNITY DYNAMICS IN HELSINKI, FINLAND
Ever wanted to know how interspeciﬁc interactions
are aﬀected by the spatial setting? If so, you
are invited to apply for a three-year post graduate
fellowship, available from August 2005 onwards in
the Metapopulation Research Group ( www.helsinki.ﬁ/-
science/metapop ), Department of Biological and En-
vironmental Sciences, University of Helsinki, Finland.
The monthly salary is ca. 1900 EUR and your super-
visor will be Tomas Roslin.
The PhD project is aimed at analyzing how local com-
munities of insects on oak (Quercus robur) are aﬀected
by host tree genotype and the spatial location of the
host tree. You will combine large-scale ﬁeld experi-
ments with repeated surveys of local insect communi-
ties. The project has a strong empirical focus, but al-
lows for interaction with several theoretically-minded
members of a broader research group. A demonstrated
record of coping with strenuous ﬁeld work and good
skills in statistical analysis (generalized linear models
in particular) are counted as major advantages.
Applications including a short CV and two letters of
recommendation should be submitted by 25 June 2005
to Dr. Tomas Roslin by email, tomas.roslin@helsinki.ﬁ.

UHelsinki SticklebacksPhD position in Evolutionary Ecology The eﬀects of
eutrophication on sexual selection and viability of stick-
leback populations
A 3-year PhD project is available in the research group
of Ulrika Candolin in the Department of Biology and
Environmental Sciences of the University of Helsinki,
Finland.
Environmental heterogeneity can cause the inten-
sity and direction of selection to vary in time and
space. Yet, the eﬀects of human-induced environ-
mental changes on selection and evolution are poorly
known. Currently, the breeding habitats of the three-
spine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus are changing
in the Baltic Sea due to eutrophication and increased
growth of ﬁlamentous algae and phytoplankton. The
aim of the project is to investigate the eﬀects of in-
creased algae growth and water turbidity on sexual
signalling, mate preferences and the intensity and di-
rection of selection on diﬀerent traits in sticklebacks.
The work will be realised through ﬁeld and labora-
tory experiments, both at a ﬁeld station by the sea
(Tv¨ arminne Zoological Station) and in the lab in the
city. Molecular genetic techniques will be applied to
determine the paternity of eggs. For further informa-
tion, see http://www.mv.helsinki.ﬁ/home/ucandoli/ or
contact ulrika.candolin@helsinki.ﬁ.
Starting date would be August 1st at the earliest. The
salary is approximately 1900 EUR/month. Experience
of working with ﬁsh as experimental animals and of
molecular techniques is an advantage, but not nec-
essary. Interested candidates should send a curricu-
lum vitae, a brief summary of research experience and
interests, and contact details of two referees to ul-
rika.candolin@helsinki.ﬁ, or Ulrika Candolin, Dept of
Biological & Environmental Sciences, PO Box 65, FI-
00014 University of Helsinki, Finland. The review of
applicants will start on June 24th.

NERC Studentship: Sensory and Chemical Ecology
Group
Department of Biological Sciences
Closing date for applications: 28 June 2005
Applications are invited for a three-year NERC-funded
CASE studentship to be held in the Sensory & Chemi-
cal Ecology Group at the University of Hull. The stu-
dentship will be supported by the CASE partner En-
glish Nature.
Background: Pheromones are key players in the regu-
lation of social interactions of almost all animals. The
identiﬁcation of pheromones can give great insight into
the physiology, behavioural ecology and evolution of a
species and it facilitates research into the physiological
and genetic basis of olfactory receptors, as well as into
the function of the brain. In freshwater crayﬁsh chem-
ical signals are involved in aggressive as well as sex-
ual behaviour. They are crucial for the maintenance of
dominance hierarchies and appear to be important for
the assessment of sexual receptivity. Yet, the speciﬁc
function and chemical nature of crayﬁsh pheromones is
not known. Environmental organisations have a strong
interest to enrich pheromones in order to use them as
lures to trap invasive crayﬁsh species.
The PhD project: The PhD student will perform a
complement of behavioural and chemical studies into
the nature of sex and dominance pheromones in two
invasive crayﬁsh species Pacifastacus leniusculus andJuly 1, 2005 EvolDir 11
Procambarus clarkii. The NERC studentship covers
University fees, and for UK students, pays a stipend of
ca.£12,000 pa
Research Group: The Sensory and Chemical Ecology
group at Hull is an expanding team with 2 lectur-
ers, 2 TAs, 5 PhDs and 3 Masters students working
on the chemical ecology, behaviour and ecotoxicology
of marine and freshwater crustaceans, polychaetes and
ﬁsh. We are well equipped with aquatic facilities, be-
havioural analysis tools (video tools, analysis software)
and chemical analytical facilities (HPLC, GC-MS, ac-
cess to LC-MS). .
Proﬁle: Applicants should have an appropriate degree
in the life science disciplines (biology, biochemistry,
zoology, behavioural ecology) and a broad interest in
chemical ecology, behaviour and evolution. Some expe-
riences in behavioural and chemical techniques or with
crustaceans would be advantageous but the candidate
will receive good training in all relevant techniques.
He/she will be supervised by Drs. Thomas Breithaupt
and Joerg Hardege (Department of Biology, Hull) and

I need al the help I can get with ﬁnding a PhD student!
A NERC PhD studentship has become available in the
research group of Dr Kirsten Wolﬀ at the University of
Newcastle, UK
Title: Genetical Ecology and Molecular Evolution in
plants.
Eligibility: Applicants must be eligible according
to NERC criteria which can be found at http://-
www.nerc.ac.uk/students/eligible/ (UK students only,
sorry)
Genetic diversity and adaptation are important issues
when we want to understand biodiversity and mainte-
nance of diversity in plant species, wild as well as cul-
tivated. With the development of molecular markers
we can now get much deeper insights in the evolution-ary and population genetic processes that contribute to
this. In this studentship there is a range of questions
that could be answered depending on the interest of the
student.
There are opportunities for developing the project in a
number of directions depending on the interests of the
student appointed.
You will join an active research group, interested in a
broad range of aspects of population genetics and evolu-
tionary biology, in both animals and plants. The group
is housed in a well equipped molecular laboratory, in-
cluding DNA sequencer. Newcastle is a great and ex-
citing place to live, with wonderful countryside within
reach. For further information on the project, require-
ments and how to apply: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/biol/-

phylogenetic analysis of a certain domain-class. Right
now I have my ﬁnal protein-dataset, containing approx.630 Sequences, and I need to decide which program to
use. What I need is a software, that is able to com-
pute a heuristic tree search (ML) using the WAG-I-G
model for over 600 Sequences ( ~130 AAs in length). I
ﬁrst thought of using something like TreePuzzle, but it
seems ot be limited to less then 300 Sequences/dataset.
My second idea was MrBayes but tests I performed to-
day showed that no computer I have access to is able
to deal with this amount of data in MrBayes (out of
Memory).
In case someone has a good advice on which programm22 EvolDir July 1, 2005
to test next I would really appreciate a short notice
(hoeppner AT uni-muenster.de).

Arlequin AFLP answers
Thank you to the many people who responded to my
question regarding Arlequin, AMOVA, and AFLP data
input ﬁles. Below I have summarized what I found so
far to be the four most helpful solutions, including my
feedback in capital letters and annotated versions of
selected email responses. Cheers, Molly

Solution #1: Use Transformer-3b.01 software to
create Arlequin ﬁle. THIS WAS THE BEST SO-
LUTION FOR MY PARTICULAR DATA SET,AND I EXPECT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR
ANYONE. VERY VERY EASY TO USE - CUT
AND PASTE INTO SIMPLE EXCEL FORMAT. I

Solution #2: Use GenAIEx to create your Arlequin
ﬁle and/or do your actual analyses in GenAIEx.
GENAIEX VER.6.0 DOESN’T CURRENTLY CON-
VERT DOMINANT DATA TO ARLEQUIN FORMAT
(ONLY CODOMINANT DATA); HOWEVER, YOU
CAN DO THE AMOVA IN GENAIEX WITHOUT
CONVERTING TO ARLEQUIN. CAVEATS: MISS-

WILL NOT PROCEED IF ANY POPULATION HAS
ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL. OVERALL, VERY EASY
TO USE AND COULD BE A VERY GOOD SOLU-
TION FOR MOST USERS. Peakall R and Smouse PE

another program to run your analysis. I recommend
GenAlEx (by Smouse and Peakall). The input ﬁle and
use of the program is user friendly. You can also use

Bovine faecal preservation
Hi,
I’m looking for ways of preserving bovine faecal sam-
ples for subsequent DNA analysis that don’t involve a
freezer! Ethanol or silica-based drying methods appear
to be commonly used for ungulates, however most of the
studies I’ve encountered so far involve the preservation
of “pellets” rather than “pats”. Can anyone recom-
mend an alternative method that may be better than
ethanol or silica, which avoids the usual problems of
transporting ﬂammable liquids and trying to dry faeces
in the ﬁeld?

Cloning mystery
Hello,
I would be grateful if anyone would be able to help me
in construction of clone librairies .
I use to clone PCR fragments but since one month I
try without success to clone a 2.3Kb DNA fragment. I
cloned a 2.3 KB fragment (16S-23S rDNA) from envi-
ronmental samples with TOPO TA kit. I checked by
PCR the transformants: I had with success 40 clones.
I sent them for sequencing and .......... surprise: the
cloned fragment was a piece of the vector TOPO.
I tried again to clone my fragment in pGMT Easy, pre-
viously isolated in agarose gel. I had white colonies,
but when I checked by digestion with Eco RI all the
transformants were without the right fragment.
If you know of anyone that might be able to help, I
would also appreciate your help. Please contact me to
the address given below.
Thank you very much for your help!

ContigEditors answers
Dear Colleagues,
I received many responses to my query about contig
editors. In particular, I am seeking one that will 1)
align contigs (to each other, across individuals), 2) al-low access to chromatograms with a simple mouse click
(so that data can be compared quickly and easily both
between primer reads from one individual and between
multiple individuals in a data set), 3) work with Beck-
man sequencer data, 4) be economical for evolutionary
biologists without huge grants, and 5) be relatively easy
to use and bug-free.
In brief, no one wrote and said that they know of a
package that meets all these criteria. But hope is (hope-
fully) on the horizon. Peter Richterich of Codoncode
informed me that he has received several requests for
the contig alignment feature with easy access to chro-
matograms, and he hopes to incorporate this feature
into Codoncode Aligner ( http://www.codoncode.com/-
) by the end of this year. For non-proﬁts, this program
costs US $960 for the ﬁrst copy and $480 for subse-
quent copies (and the prices are easily found on their
website, unlike some companies). I use this program in
my lab and am very happy with it (except for the lack
of the nested contig feature). It meets criteria 3, 4, and
5, and is easy to use. It also can do base calling and
assembly with PC versions of PHRED and PHRAP.
The programmers at Codoncode are very accessible (re-
sponses to emails within the hour, and answering their
own phones) and even have a webpage for suggestions.
Based on responses I received to my query, many of you
will be anxious to have the contig alignment feature as
well.
Several people recommended Staden, and Bioedit
(http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.htm ),
which are free. I don’t know these programs, but Tom
Hall, the author of Bioedit told me that it doesn’t do
contig assembly (see below). A user disagrees and sent
me a screenshot to prove it. Does it use an accessory
program to do this? In any case, it sounds like a
versatile and useful program, and you can’t beat the
price.
Biolign is by Tom Hall as well, and Kristen Shepard
(below) says that it does many things I asked about.
I received several recommendations for Seqman II. I
have checked this program out and it was expensive
and didn’t align contigs.
At any rate, I plan to sit tight and hope that Codon-
code gets it right, and soon. In the meantime, a lot of us
are feeling pretty frustrated with the options available
(many responses NOT included below).
Thanks,
Steve

many expressing dismay at the current state of aﬀairs:July 1, 2005 EvolDir 25
***** Hi Steve,
Have you tried Staden?
Staden is suﬃciently powerful to do (very) large assem-
blies (I have assembled several BAC clones). It also
has a mutation/heterozygous indels detection compo-
nent (originally designed for clinical mutation scans,
but is easily adapted for SNP/population genetics and
other evolutionary analyses).
It is fast, free, has good graphics and trace viewing fa-
cilities and has an excellent manual/online help. Staden
runs on any UNIX platform with X windows. There is
also a PC/MSWindows port, but it is somewhat buggy
and no longer supported, however, for some purposes it
will do just ﬁne - I wouldn’t recommend the Windows
version for large assemblies, though.
http://staden.sourceforge.net/ It takes some time to
learn to make best use of its large number of features.
If you choose to give it a try and need any pointers, feel
free to contact me.
Best wishes
Anette Becher **** Hi Steve,
BioEdit is freely available at http://-
www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html It does
not do contig assemblies and was never published in a
peer-reviewed journal.
BioLign is an editor that sits on top of multiple short
phrap assemblies. It is not freely available at this time.
It does not do contig assembly itself, but requires le-
gal copies of phred and phrap and uses phrap output.
I think those are legally free to academic users. It is
unsuitable for genome-size assemblies, and is not well
suited for assemblies that contain more than about 20
traces passing through any one region of an assembly,
because of the way that trace viewing was implemented.
It was primarily designed for doing automated align-
ments of multiple assemblies of alleles of the same gene
or very close homologs that align well at the nucleotide
level. The interface provides a multiple alignment of se-
quence asseblies, with each assembly expandable into a
synchronized alignment of the sequence traces for man-
ual inspection of the data. It can be useful for a narrow
range of uses, but is not the most versatile program for
sequence assemblies.

-Tom Hall ***** Steve,

DNA extraction techniques
Message:
Does anyone know of a cheap 96 well DNA extraction
protocol that has worked on Penaeids? I have previ-
ously had diﬃculty with inhibitors that I assume co-
precipitate with DNA in precipitation based extrac-
tions. A colleague suggested that these may be gly-
coproteins found in the exoskeleton of the prawns, but
I encounter the problem when extracting from muscle
tissue with no traces of exoskeleton. I have had good
success with Qiagen DNeasy columns in both single and
plate format but they are cost prohibitive given the
large number of samples I have. Any advice on other
plate format extraction techniques would be appreci-
ated.

IntelligentDesign ﬁlm at
Smithsonian
To the evolution community:
Many of you may be aware from recent newspaper
articles (for example, the New York Times article
available at http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/-
national/28smithsonian ), that the NationalMuseum of
Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution is about
to show a ﬁlm that was co-written and co-produced
by members of the creationist Discovery Institute.
(The showing is on June 23.) This ﬁlm, called “The
Privileged Planet”, the Search for Purpose in the
Universe“. It is an attempt to use geology, climatology,
and physics to show that the earth was designed by
an intelligent designer, and of course is part of the
latest strategy of ”intelligent design“ creationists to
worm their way into the public consciousness and
school curriculum. You can read about the ﬁlm
at its website http://www.privilegedplanet.com/,
and see the Discovery Institute’s announcement of
the co-sponsorship at http://www.discovery.org/-
scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=-
133&program=CSC&isEvent=true
Although the Smithsonian must give non-proﬁt organi-
zations (of which the Discovery Institute is apparently
one) the right to present ﬁlms in its facilities, it seems
wrong for the Smithsonian to also co-sponsor such ﬁlms.
The Smithsonian has a history of supporting the fact
of evolution, and in fact has a wonderful Hall of Evo-
lution in the NMNH to present the data. Why, then,
is it co-sponsoring this ﬁlm? The eﬀect of this is to
give a U.S. government imprimatur to the activities of
the Discovery Institute. The Discovery Institute is of
course playing up this co-sponsorship on its website.
The director of the National Museum of Natual His-
tory, which is co-sponsoring the ﬁlm, is Christian Sam-
per, whose email address is SamperC@si.edu . I would
urge you to consider emailing him and expressing your
feelings about this event.
I am sure that Dr. Samper is not very happy with
this event (apparently the Discovery Institute sneaked
in the ﬁlm under the Museum’s radar), but perhaps a
series of emails from evolutionists could get the Smith-
sonian re-examine its policy of cosponsoring events like
this. Needless to say, we should all be polite in our
emails.Thanks. Jerry Coyne

Magnesphere beads
Dear members,
I have to questions concerning the use of magnesphere
beads and a mix of oligos for the enrichment step of a
microsat library protocol 1) We have promega magne-
sphere beads Z5481. Unfortunatly, the leaﬂets that
come with the beads are lost. I looked up the protocol
on Promegas website, but it describes RNA puriﬁca-
tion. Can I use the same protocol for the enrichment
step of my genomic DNA or are there maybe other (bet-
ter) protocols out there?
2) We have GA15B, CA15B, GATA5B. Could I use a
mix of those three bitynilated probes or would I get bet-
ter results if I used them one by one in the hybridization
step?
Thanks,

Multiple Outgroups
I performed a PAUP run with two outgroup taxa spec-
iﬁed indicating that the ingroup should be made mono-
phyletic and this message came up: “tree can not be
rooted such that speciﬁed ingroup is monophyletic”.
The resultant tree emerged with one of the outgroup
taxa (the second in my MacClade list) pairing up with
one of the ingroup taxa. When I reversed the order
of the outgroup taxa in MacClade and reran, the out-
groups reversed positions in the tree. The second out-
group always seems to pair up with an ingroup taxon.
Is there an explanation? Many thanks. Bill Chapco.

I wanted to get it up and functioning asap, but keep
in mind that it will be undergoing both short term and
long term reﬁnements (and some parts are still incom-
plete). This is just a start, although I think it’s a very
good one, and puts SSE onto the internet with a strong
new presence.
The site was designed by Chris Gates, a professional

PygmyPipehorse samples
Dear all,
I am trying to get hold of a single sample of a pygmy
pipehorse for a phylogenetic study on the evolution of
seahorses.July 1, 2005 EvolDir 29
Description: There are three genera of pygmy
pipehorses, namely Idiotropiscis (Autralia), Acen-
tronura (Indo-Paciﬁc) and Amphelikturus (Caribbean).
Any one of these will be suitable for the study.
Please see the following websites for details:
Idiotropiscis: www.amonline.net.au/ﬁshes/ ﬁsh-
facts/ﬁsh/ilumnitzeri.htm Acentronura: http://-
www.seahorse.org/gallery/Pipehorses (Amphelikturus
looks similar)
Reward: Anyone who can send a good-quality sam-
ple (ideally preserved in ethanol and not dried or
formaldehyde-ﬁxed) will receive co-authorship. We al-
ready have a large data-base of nuclear and mitochon-
drial seahorse and pipeﬁsh sequences, and the pygmy
pipehorse will be crucial in understanding how and
when seahorses derived from their pipeﬁsh ancestors.
This is likely to get published in a very high-ranking
journal!!
Legislation: Pygmy pipehorses are not CITES listed,
but any local regulations should be adhered to (this
applies particularly to Australia).

Qst computation
I am writing a simulation program for a quantitative
trait in a structured population and I have a question
about how one computes Q st (the population diﬀer-
entiation in a quantitative trait; similar to F st). It is
deﬁned as the ratio of the mean additive genetic vari-
ation within demes to the sum of two times the mean
additive genetic variation within demes and that for
between deme variance. I have been computing the
within and between deme components of variance us-
ing ANOVA logic (sum of squares over degrees of free-
dom) but this does not appear to be the same as the

Rate Constancy
Dear EvolDir members,
I have intraspeciﬁc COI data in which certain popula-
tions (group A) appear to have about twice larger sub-
stitution rate than others (group B). This assumption
is based on the mean number of pairwise diﬀerences
within each group and on terminal branch lengths in a
neighbour-joining tree.
Could you suggest me an appropriate method to test
this assumption, i.e. particularly that the group A has
faster substitution rate than the group B. Is it possible
to evaluate how much faster?
The data set consists of 55 haplotypes (22 in group A)
and there is little support for the nodes in the NJ tree.
Groups A and B are not monophyletic as well, there-
fore tests based on a well deﬁned topology do not seem
suitable to me.
thanks in advance, Asta

I have been using the 1000bp ladder for a long time.
We have never had a problem with it.
The ABI 1000 bp ladder only works for non denaturing
gels. The Bioventures ladder and maybe the ladders
supplied by The Gel Company, are to be used in de-
naturing conditions. The capillary ABI machines use
a polymer (it acts like the ’gel’) - your fragments run
through this polymer. The polymer is denaturing so
you have to make sure you use a ladder that is reliable
and accurate under denaturing conditions.

Rodent population cycling
Dear Biologists of Rodent Population Cycling,
I have been involved in a project with Bo Niklasson
in Stockholm demonstrating the determinative impact
of a newly discovered picornavirus on the population
cycles of rodents in northern Sweden (see Niklasson et
al. 1999. A new picornavirus isolated form bank voles.
Virology 255:89-93). Interacting with stress, the virus
causes diabetes, heart and reproductive diseases in ro-
dents. Additionally, this work suggests a determinative
impact on human diseases. We would like to extend the
rodent studies to North America, where the virus has
also been found in native rodents.
Please let me know if you might be interesting in collab-
orating on this work by making available ﬁeld-caught
rodents (voles are of particular interest) for diabetes
testing. We envision that we would come to your locale
to perform glucose tolerance tests on the animals, and
retain tissue samples to test for the virus.

SimonLevin wins KyotoPrize
>From - The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology -
Inamori Foundation Announces 21st Annual Kyoto
Prize Laureates for Lifetime Achievements in Technol-
ogy, Science, and the Arts
http://www.kyotoprize.org/pressrel 061005.htm The
announcement for the Basic Science Prize reads as fol-
lows:
The 2005 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences focuses on the
ﬁeld of Biological Sciences. Professor Simon A. Levin
will receive the award for establishing the ﬁeld of “spa-
tial ecology” and expanding scientiﬁc understanding of
the biosphere as a “complex adaptive system.”
Professor Levin’s use of mathematical models to under-
stand the complex patterns of the biosphere has made
a substantial impact on environmental sciences and led
to new methods of environmental protection. In 1974,
with Dr. Robert T. Paine, he proposed the “patch
dynamics model” that forms the basis of many cur-
rent ecological models for marine and terrestrial ecosys-tems. He also demonstrated that high species diver-
sity among competitors – as observed, for example, in
rocky inter-tidal communities, or in tropical rain forests
– can be maintained by recurrent disturbance. Pro-
fessor Levin has actively collaborated with economists
and environmental scientists to propose methods for
dealing with environmental problems. His work has
shown that ecosystems and the biosphere are not super-
organisms, as previously suggested, but complex adap-
tive systems with apparent regularity emerging from
self-organization processes. Among his primary con-
cerns are the staggering losses in biodiversity worldwide
that have resulted in the recent past from the mass pro-
duction, consumption and waste disposal practices of
human populations. His 1999 book, “Fragile Domin-
ion,” illustrates how the loss of biodiversity has created
direct threats to human survival, and identiﬁes a series
of actions urgently necessary for maintaining biodiver-
sity. In proposing many methods of biological conser-
vation and ecosystem management, Professor Levin has
made fundamental contributions to environmental sci-
ence.
Simon Levin served as SMB President from 1987 to
1989. Congratulations Simon!

Museum Quits as Film Sponsor
By THE NEW YORK TIMES Published: June 3, 2005
The Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of
Natural History has withdrawn its co-sponsorship of
a showing later this month of a ﬁlm that supports thetheory of “intelligent design.”
The museum said it would not cancel the screening of
the ﬁlm, “The Privileged Planet,” but would return
the $16,000 that the Discovery Institute, an organiza-
tion that promotes a skeptical view of the Darwinian
theory of evolution, had paid it.
Proposals for events at the National Museum of Natu-
ral History are reviewed by members of the staﬀ, and
it shares sponsorship of all events. After the news of
the showing caused controversy, however, oﬃcials of the
museum screened “Privileged Planet” for themselves.
“The major problem with the ﬁlm is the wrap-up,” said
Randall Kremer, a museum spokesman.

Software Lamarc2 0
We have just released version 2.0 of the LAMARC pro-
gram (part of the LAMARC package).July 1, 2005 EvolDir 33
LAMARC uses genetic data from a population to es-
timate several population parameters: size of subpop-
ulations, subpopulation growth rates, migration rates
among subpopulations, and overall recombination rate.
The algorithm is Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain
Monte Carlo; we search through a wide space of ge-
nealogies representing the possible histories of the data.
Suitable data for this program includes DNA or RNA
sequences, SNPs, microsatellites, or elecrophoretic alle-
les. Phase may be known or (with some loss of power)
unknown.
A serious bug existed in previous versions of Lamarc
(not including Recombine) that could lead to failure
to adequately deal with DNA or SNP markers of un-
known phase. Please disregard any earlier results with
DNA or SNP markers of unknown phase and re-run the
analysis.
Version 2.0 adds:
Bayesian Analysis. LAMARC can now run a Bayesian
analysis instead of performing a Frequentist one.
LAMARC supports both linear and logarthimic priors
with arbitrary boundaries. Users are strongly encour-
aged to set the prior boundaries appropriately for their
datasets.
Converter Graphical User Interface. A GUI that re-
places the current text menu converter is now available
for all supported platforms. The GUI is a beta-test
release which works poorly on X11 windowing environ-
ments. The text-based ﬁle converter is still available.
Constrained Parameters. LAMARC can now combine
subsets of parameters for a particular force into groups.
Each group can either be held constant at a given value
or constrained to all be equal to each other. Runs which
estimate fewer independent parameters will use their
search time more eﬃciently, but incorrectly constrain-
ing a parameter may bias the estimate of all other pa-
rameters.
Relative Mu and Ne. LAMARC now handles analysis
of data with known diﬀering rates of mutation or popu-
lation size: for example, a run can correctly incorporate
both mtDNA and nuclear DNA. It does not currently
allow for the speciﬁcation of a distribution of rates or
sizes.
Performance improvements. Maximization of the likeli-
hood surface now succeeds on a wider range of surfaces.
A new arranger is available for use that just lengthens
and shrinks all the branches in the tree; this may in-
crease the eﬀectiveness of the search, particularly in
Bayesian runs.
Interface Cleanup. Models of marker evolution maynow be set/changed in the menu.

Software SQUINT 1 0
We have released a new multiple sequence alignment
editor called SQUINT. SQUINT is written in Java and
requires that a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is installed.
The program can be dowloaded without a JVM from
http://www.bioinformatics.org.nz under the Software
Link, and is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
SQUINT has the following features:
-o- Read and export ﬁles in FASTA, PHYLIP and
NEXUS formats -o- Nucleotide sequences can be viewed
as amino acids or codons, with codon boundaries in-
dicated -o- Display sequences in split windows, with
diﬀerent windows showing diﬀerent views (e.g., nu-
cleotides and amino acids) -o- View changes to align-
ment scores in real time as alignment is edited -o- Ver-
satile editing features, including block selection, point
selection, left and right insertion of gaps
In addition to its editing features, SQUINT is also a
multiple alignment program. SQUINT can align all se-
quences in the alignment, selected sequences, or even
selected blocks within an existing alignment. SQUINT
can align the translated amino acids of nucleotide se-
quences, and back-translate the alignment to the origi-
nal nucleotide sequences, a feature that we consider to
be particularly useful.
Documentation is embedded within the program within
the Help menu option, and the context-speciﬁc Help34 EvolDir July 1, 2005

Stationarity tests answers
Stationarity of nucleotide frequencies is an important
assumption of most sequence evolution models. Al-
though ML tree reconstrucion is to some extent robust
against the violation of underlying assumptions, one
never knows how much violation is actually tolerated
before the method produces wrong results. It is there-
fore good practice to exclude sequences from the analy-
sis whose base compositions deviate too much from the
average.
A popular method to facilitate this decision is a simple
chi-square test which compares the nucleotide distribu-
tion of each sequence with that of the whole data set:
It rejects a sequence if it becomes improbable that the
two distributions are equal. Many people have been us-
ing this test over years and I too have implemented it in
my own software - whithout thinking too much about
it.
The problem is that p-values produced by this method
depend strongly on the sequence lengths. Any natu-
rally evolving sequence which is to some extent oﬀ the
equilibirium will pass the test if it is only short enough,
and any sequence that is long enough will fail - no mat-
ter how good or bad it is. Especially the punishment of
long sequences is bad because ML tree reconstruction
is known to become more and more reliable the longer
the sequences are.
Take a small sequence alignment whose sequences have
passed the chi-square test and concatenate it several
times with itself. You will be surprised that very likely
some of the sequences are being rejected now, though
the phylogenetic information can not have changed.
I am looking for alternatives. Any ideas? Is there a sim-
ple way to check that the base composition in a dataset is or was suitable for tree reconstruction?
Gangolf
———————————————
Hi Gangolf
Perhaps one way to do this is to use parametric boot-
strapping, as follows:
1. Estimate the best (i.e., ML) model of evolution, sta-
tionary frequencies, and tree for a given dataset. 2. Use
the estimated model, frequencies and tree to generate
simulated datasets. 3. Now estimate the distribution
of your Chi-squared statistics using the simulated se-
quences.
You can now assess how each sequence ﬁts against this
distribution.
Of course, this approach is predicated on your choice
of the model that best describes the evolution of the
sequences. The ML rate/tree/frequency estimates of a
less-than-satisfactory model will give an inappropriate
chi-squared distribution.
Be interested to know how this works. Cheers

Hi,
My view on how to think about this is as a model selec-
tion problem: We have to choose between a model M0
under which all sequences have the same base compo-
sition, and models M1,... under which some sequences
have diﬀerent base compostions.
It is well known that many classical (p-
value/likelihood/LRT/AIC) model selection methods
are asymptotically inconsistent, meaning that as the
number of i.i.d. observations goes to inﬁnity the
probability of selecting the the right model does not go
to one. In contrast, the Bayes factor and BIC (a.k.a.
Schwarz criterion) are asymptotically consistent.
Note that consistency is an entirely classical concept,
referring to probabilities in repeated sampling under
the same true model. In this sense, Bayesian methods
perform better by a classical criterion.
The BIC is like a LRT/AIC model selection criterion,
but is
BIC = 2 x (lnL(M1) - lnL(M0)) - k ln(n)
where k is the diﬀerence in degrees of freedom of the
two models, and n is the number of i.i.d. observations.
Thus as n gets large we

Stationarity tests answers2
Dear Brian,
here are some collected late answers to my queries,
and one answer to an answer. The ﬁrst is about my
I+Gamma question, the other two about stationarity
tests.
Best wishes, Gangolf
—————————————————–
Dear Gangolf,
Concerning the I+G questions and the interesting dis-
cussion that followed ? given the high increase insequence-data availability it certainly looks like the
I+G model is problematic. We have recently devel-
oped a novel evolutionary model that is based on a
mixture of gamma density functions. This model gen-
eralizes the traditional gamma distribution model and
the I+G model by assuming the existence of a number
of gamma distributions (components), each character-
ized by its own set of parameters (alpha and beta). This
mixture-model further deﬁnes the a priori probability
for each gamma component. The resulting model can
accommodate a multi-modal rate distribution, where
the number of modes depends on the number of gamma
components and how diﬀerent each component is from
another. We showed that the Gamma-mixture model
can better describe the among-site-rate-heterogeneity
of sequence evolution using both simulations and real
data examples. This model also improves the inference
of site-speciﬁc evolutionary rates.
The paper describing the Gamma-mixture model will
be presented in the upcoming ECCB meetings and will
appear in Bioinformatics (attached please ﬁnd the lat-
est draft).
Best,

Gangolf:
You have initiated a great discussion on the evoldir.
I am about to submit a ms for publication in which I
use ANOVA to compare the principal components of
the nucleotide frequencies across the eutherian tree. I
presented the results at the 2004 evolution meetings in
Colorado. This tree is a great example of the homo-
geneity test failing to reveal serious base composition
bias across the tree. This happens for several related
reasons.
Negative results for the homogeneity test do not sug-
gest that the sequences are homogeneous but rather
suggests that they contain insuﬃcient evidence to re-
ject homogeneity in favor of heterogeneity. In short,
compared to the mean base frequencies, the standard
errors are too large to reveal heterogeneity. And that
is because so much of the variance (within that stan-
dard error) among sequences is explained by diﬀerences
across the clades. The among-clade diﬀerences inﬂate
the standard error so and these go undetected by the
homogeneity test.
Note that Swoﬀord warns of this problem at the end of
the output for his test in PAUP. The test ignores tree
structure. So a test that accounts speciﬁcally for the
variance among the clades is needed too.36 EvolDir July 1, 2005
Principal components analysis looks at the full multi-
variate correlation structure of the four nucleotide fre-
quencies across the sequences and transforms them to
uncorrelated variables (the principal components that
are appropriate for ANOVA. ANOVA on the PCs sepa-
rates the within-clade variance from the among-clade
variance to demonstrate the serious departure from
base composition homogeneity demanded by current
models of sequence evolution.
Hope that makes some sense.
Cheers, Pat

Hi,
Be careful about using the BIC. It is known to be too
conservative for model selection, even in quite simple
experimental situations. Work is currently being un-
dertaken to improve it. BIC is an asymptotic approxi-
mation to the Bayes factor which ASSUMES A UNIT
REFERENCE PRIOR. ie a prior whose information
content is equal to the average information content of
one observation. This may or may not be appropriate
for your analysis. BIC will not approximate the Bayes
factor calculated under diﬀerent priors. If you are will-
ing to make the standard Bayesian assumptions, direct
speciﬁcation of priors and calculation of Bayes factors
is the way to go for Bayesian model selection, in my
humble opinion. Of course, in many circumstances this
can be diﬃcult.
See Sociological Methods Research Vol. 33 (2004) and
Vol. 27 (1999) for a thorough discussion on the use and
abuse of the BIC for model selection.
Cheers,
Simon.

Hi,
Be careful about using the BIC. It is known to be too
conservative for model selection, even in quite simple
experimental situations. Work is currently being un-
dertaken to improve it. BIC is an asymptotic approxi-
mation to the Bayes factor which ASSUMES A UNIT
REFERENCE PRIOR. ie a prior whose information
content is equal to the average information content of
one observation. This may or may not be appropriate
for your analysis. BIC will not approximate the Bayes
factor calculated under diﬀerent priors. If you are will-
ing to make the standard Bayesian assumptions, direct
speciﬁcation of priors and calculation of Bayes factors
is the way to go for Bayesian model selection, in my
humble opinion. Of course, in many circumstances this
can be diﬃcult.
See Sociological Methods Research Vol. 33 (2004) and
Vol. 27 (1999) for a thorough discussion on the use and
abuse of the BIC for model selection.

Dear Brian,
here are some collected late answers to my queries,
and one answer to an answer. The ﬁrst is about my
I+Gamma question, the other two about stationarity
tests.
Best wishes, Gangolf—————————————————–
Dear Gangolf,
Concerning the I+G questions and the interesting dis-
cussion that followed ? given the high increase in
sequence-data availability it certainly looks like the
I+G model is problematic. We have recently devel-
oped a novel evolutionary model that is based on a
mixture of gamma density functions. This model gen-
eralizes the traditional gamma distribution model and
the I+G model by assuming the existence of a number
of gamma distributions (components), each character-
ized by its own set of parameters (alpha and beta). This
mixture-model further deﬁnes the a priori probability
for each gamma component. The resulting model can
accommodate a multi-modal rate distribution, where
the number of modes depends on the number of gamma
components and how diﬀerent each component is from
another. We showed that the Gamma-mixture model
can better describe the among-site-rate-heterogeneity
of sequence evolution using both simulations and real
data examples. This model also improves the inference
of site-speciﬁc evolutionary rates.
The paper describing the Gamma-mixture model will
be presented in the upcoming ECCB meetings and will
appear in Bioinformatics (attached please ﬁnd the lat-
est draft).
Best,
Itay Mayrose and Tal Pupko

Gangolf:
You have initiated a great discussion on the evoldir.
I am about to submit a ms for publication in which I
use ANOVA to compare the principal components of
the nucleotide frequencies across the eutherian tree. I
presented the results at the 2004 evolution meetings in
Colorado. This tree is a great example of the homo-
geneity test failing to reveal serious base composition
bias across the tree. This happens for several related
reasons.
Negative results for the homogeneity test do not sug-
gest that the sequences are homogeneous but rather
suggests that they contain insuﬃcient evidence to re-
ject homogeneity in favor of heterogeneity. In short,
compared to the mean base frequencies, the standard
errors are too large to reveal heterogeneity. And that
is because so much of the variance (within that stan-
dard error) among sequences is explained by diﬀerences
across the clades. The among-clade diﬀerences inﬂate
the standard error so and these go undetected by the
homogeneity test.38 EvolDir July 1, 2005
Note that Swoﬀord warns of this problem at the end of
the output for his test in PAUP. The test ignores tree
structure. So a test that accounts speciﬁcally for the
variance among the clades is needed too.
Principal components analysis looks at the full multi-
variate correlation structure of the four nucleotide fre-

Diﬀerential molecular and physiological response of pe-
dunculate and sessile oaks to hypoxia
The genetic group of UMR BIOGECO is conducting
research activities in three main areas 1- Evolutionary
biology and population genetics 2- Genomics 3- Tree
improvement
Since several years, this group is working on molecu-
lar diﬀerentiation between pedunculate and sessile oaks.
These two species are sympatric although they occupy
ecological diﬀerent niches: pedunculate oak grows on
humid and rich soils and is tolerant to waterlogging but
is sensitive to drought and sessile oak needs acid and
dry soil. Hybridization is observed between the two
species. Several genetic studies using neutral molecular
markers showed similar genetic diversity between the
two species with a very low interspeciﬁc diﬀerentiation.
Only allelic frequency diﬀerences were obtained. How-
ever, morphological and physiological diﬀerences were
observed. For instance, pedunculate oak is more toler-
ant to waterlogging than sessile oak. Although genomes
of both species exhibit high molecular similarity, ge-
nomic regions involved in species diﬀerentiation do ex-
ist. It seems particularly interesting to focus our work
on the detection of these regions. A genetic map has
been developed on a full sib family of pedunculate oak
and has been completed for QTL analysis of bud burst,
growth and hypoxia. Experimental trials are developed
in Nancy and hypoxic stress will be applied this sum-
mer on the same full sib family.
The recruited person will work at the BioGEco unit
in INRA Bordeaux with a close cooperation with EEF
unit in INRA Nancy. He/She will be in charge on
the identiﬁcation of molecular markers diﬀerentially ex-
pressed between the two species on stressed or non
stressed conditions by using SSH libraries and pro-
teomic analysis. He/She will assess the expression level
of diﬀerentially expressed genes (hybridization, quanti-
tative PCR) and will compare transcriptomic and pro-
teomic results. He/She will realise co-locations analysis
of QTL/candidate genes.
Required knowledges: molecular biology, molecular ge-
netic, bioinformatic knowledge and population genetics.
Langage: English, FrenchThis project has been selected by INRA. The net salary
will be about 2000 .
Administrative conditions: The candidate should pos-
sess his PhD should be less than 40 years old should not
have work at INRA Bordeaux should be free in october

We just received three years of NSF funding to study
“Evolution of moth sexual communication systems”.
Our approach involves combining Quantitative Trait
Locus analysis and candidate gene approaches with
ﬁeld tests of mating success to determine the number of
genes and identity of genes that code for species speciﬁc
mating. We are especially interested in understanding
evolutionary mechanisms involved in diversiﬁcation of
complex traits that appear to be under stabilizing se-
lection. We are looking for a postdoc who wants to
conduct molecular genetic analyses to identify genes
that control sexual communication, and who also wants
to do some ﬁeld work. Candidates must have a back-
ground in molecular/quantitative genetics. Experience
in chemical ecology and the use of GC equipment would
be very helpful. The successful applicant will work in
the labs of Fred Gould and Coby Schal.
MORE BACKGROUND: Most night-ﬂying moth
species locate mates through production of, and re-
sponse to, a very precise blend of two or more volatile
chemical compounds. Within a population, females
with atypical blends have been shown to be less attrac-
tive to males than females with the population’s com-
mon blend. Similarly, rare males that respond to atyp-
ical blends have been found to be at a disadvantage in
ﬁnding mates. The genes that control pheromone blend
ratios have never been found to be linked to, or aﬀect
male response, so mutations that cause changes in each
of the two components of communication are expected
to arise independently. On a simple theoretical level,
this type of sexual communication system is expected
to be evolutionarily constrained because an individual
with a mutation leading to an altered blend or response
will be selected against, when rare. Even if the selective
disadvantage to rare individuals with alleles for novel
signals or responses is minimal, mass selection is not
expected to increase their frequency in the population.
Based on these assumptions it is diﬃcult to account for
the great diversiﬁcation of chemical mixtures used in
mate communication by over 10,000 moth species. By
dissecting the genetic underpinnings of selective mating
in moths we are investigating a number of potential evo-
lutionary mechanisms that could have resulted in this
diversiﬁcation . We are working with two sympatricmoth species that have very distinct sex pheromone
blends, do not mate in the wild, but can be induced
to mate in the lab. We have used segregating backcross
families to map a number of QTL that control produc-
tion of speciﬁc female sex pheromone components and
male response to these components. We have moved
one speciﬁc QTL between species and tested its impact
on mating in the ﬁeld. There are a lot more experi-
ments waiting for the right postdoc!

modeling (C++ preferred) to work on an NIH-funded
project. The project is aimed at building simulation
models that link insect population dynamics and pop-
ulation genetics in a way that can contribute to im-
proving strategies for releasing transgenic mosquitoes
to reduce the incidence of human disease. Once the in-
sect modeling is complete, disease epidemiology mod-
els will be built and linked to the insect models. The42 EvolDir July 1, 2005
fellowship is for 2-3 years. In addition to working on
model development and testing, the person in this posi-
tion will collaborate in an interdisciplinary group com-
posed of mosquito ecologists, disease epidemiologists,
molecular biologists, biomathematicians, ethicists, and
scientists from disease-endemic countries, in eﬀorts to
develop novel transgenic strategies for disease reduc-
tion. The person in this position will will work with
the PI and at least one other postdoc in organizing
a workshop to teach other researchers how to use the
models. There will be an opportunity for some empiri-
cal research (if desired), and for interactions with other
members of the lab who are working on other evolution-

UCollegeLondon SexualConﬂict44 EvolDir July 1, 2005
NERC-funded Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, Depart-
ment of Biology, University College London
Determining the genetic basis of sexual conﬂict in
Drosophila melanogaster: the role of the sex peptide.
A full-time NERC funded post-doctoral position is
available for up to 36 months in the fruit-ﬂy labora-
tory of Dr Tracey Chapman ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/-
˜ ucbhtoc/tc1.html ). Sexual conﬂict exists when the
evolutionary interests of the sexes diverge over repro-
ductive decisions. In D. melanogaster, seminal ﬂuid
proteins such as the sex peptide (SP) are implicated
in mediating such conﬂicts of interests (e.g. Chapman
et al. 1995 Nature 373, 241-244; Wigby & Chapman
2005 Current Biology 15, 316-321). In this project we
will study the function of the SP, using males in which
the SP is over or under expressed (e.g. Chapman et al.
2003 PNAS, 100, 9923-9928) to conduct life history as-
says. We will investigate important questions in three
areas.
(1) What is the extent to which SP underlies conﬂict?
(2) In terms of the life history, how does the sex pep-
tide exert its harm on females? (3) What is the extent
to which SP-induced harm to females and SP-derived
beneﬁt to males interact with the environment?
The candidate should have experience in general molec-
ular biology and ﬂywork. Starting salary is 21,640 GBP
per annum pro-rata (23,970 GBP including London Al-
lowance) and the preferred starting date is January or
February 2006.
To apply and for further information, please send
a covering letter and a CV with the names and
contact details of 3 referees to Tracey Chapman

Conservation genetics of animals
November 20th - December 2nd, 2005, in Grub, Ger-
many
Rapid decline in the number of livestock breeds and
reduction of genetic variability within breeds has initi-
ated growing interest for the conservation of farm ani-
mal genetic resources. We are oﬀering a course covering
important aspects and topics in conservation genetics
to raise the competence in this ﬁeld.
The course will consist of lectures, computer exercises
(using a variety of software packages), written exercises
(pen and paper), paper discussion with presentations
(landmark papers) as well as demonstration of partic-
ular case studies and group work on given projects.
Main topics covered in the course are: deﬁnitions, glos-
sary and basic knowledge; variation within populations;
variation between populations; detrimental eﬀects and
extinction; assignment problems; criteria for choosing
units for conservation priority and conservation strate-
gies. Although targeted to the conservation of farm
animal genetic resources, the subject covered will also
be relevant and applicable to a large number of zoo and
wildlife populations.
Participants are awarded 5 ECTS credits.

ditions mimicking the cellular nanoenvironment will be
emphasized. Ralf Blossey, Bahram Houchmandzadeh
and Stanislas Leibler are co-organizers of this school.
Further informations can be found at the following ad-
dress: ( http://www.ibl.fr/noisitransnet/ ). We invite
contributions for poster or oral presentations. Priority
will be given to papers associating experimental and
theoretical approaches in the ﬁeld of single molecule
studies or in single (eukaryotic) cell expression studies.
The dead line for the submission of the papers is June
15 and the notiﬁcation of acceptance will be on July
1st.

ESF CONSERVATION GENETICS WORKSHOP 17-
19 November 2005, Santiago de Compostela, Spain
CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS (DEADLINE 24 June
2005)
The European Science Foundation is funding a series of
workshops under the ConGen programme (Integrating
population genetics and conservation biology: merg-
ing theoretical, experimental and applied approaches).
The three-day meeting (arrival Wednesday 16, depar-
ture Sunday 20 November) in Santiago de Compostela
will focus on approaches to studying genetic sources
of extinction, responses to environmental stress (in the
broadest sense) and the maintenance of adaptive diver-
sity in small and subdivided populations.July 1, 2005 EvolDir 51
We plan to host 40-44 participants, of which 14 have
already been invited. We are now selecting a further
30 participants (funding restricted to European Union
residents). If you would like to attend, send a brief
description of your research activity in conservation ge-
netics together with a title and abstract of a presenta-
tion or poster (Deadline 24 June) to Ilik Saccheri (sac-
cheri@liv.ac.uk).
There is no registration fee and we are able to cover lo-
cal costs (full board) for all participants, but for travel
costs are limited to a contribution of 150 EUR.

Meeting / workshop Demogenetics in fragmented pop-
ulations
Dates: 14-17. Sept. 2005 Site: La Fouly (VS, Switzer-
land) http://www.dolent.ch/ Small and fragmented
populations incur large viability risks in terms of dy-
namics (demographic stochasticity, Allee eﬀects) and
genetics (genetic drift, inbreeding load). Up to now, an-
alytical models were developed mostly under simple ge-
ographic (island or lattice) and demographic (patch oc-
cupancy) conditions. But the non-equilibrium dynam-
ics of metapopulations is obviously important, for both
practitioners and theoreticians. Recent approaches
have succeeded in introducing more realistic features
of landscape and demography to investigate their ef-
fects on population genetics (e.g. eﬀective population
size), population viability (e.g. metapopulation capac-
ity), and their interactions.
We have invited the 6 following people who will
present their research and lead discussion groups: Otso
Ovaskainen (Helsinki), Denis Couvet (Paris), Oscar
Gaggiotti (Grenoble), Xavier Lambin (Aberdeen), An-
drew Young (Sidney) and Etienne Rampal (Haren)
Participants will have the opportunity to present their
own research. Ample time will be allowed for discus-
sions.
Registration and further info at: http://www.unil.ch/-
dee/page11644.html Attendance limited to 30 partici-
pants Registration fees (including food and accommo-
dation) are CHF 250.-, except for students from the
Swiss universities aﬃliated to the CUSO (Gen` eve, Lau-
sanne, Neuchˆ atel, Fribourg and Bern), who will be
given priority. Deadline for registration 30th June 2005.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
