Conference: Mechanisms of Protein Evolution III, Den-
ver, 8-10 November 2015
Registration is now open for the conference, 'Mech-
anisms of Protein Evolution III, to take place 8-10
November at the University of Colorado Denver School
of Medicine, Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver.
See www.proteinevolution.org The subtopic of this
year's meeting is 'origins', which will include theory on
de novo gene birth, exaptation of novel function from
transposable elements, neo-functionalization from ex-
isting genes, adaptive modication of functions, and
synthetic biology. We are particularly interested in ex-
ploring how our understanding of the mechanisms of
protein evolution will inuence how we analyse data,
how the immense wealth of incoming data will inuence
our models, and how structural, biophysical and systems
biology principles inuence our understanding of protein
evolution.
Topics include adaptation, coevolution, convergence,
neutral processes, prediction of folding, prediction of
mutational eects, the inuence of protein-protein in-
teractions on protein evolution, and the interaction of
next-gen sequencing and model development. As in past
years, we broadly interpret our topic to include exciting
interactions with diverse elds such as phylogenetics,
human population genetics, and RNA structure.
For more information see http://-
www.proteinevolution.org/ The conference is limited to
50 participants and registration will be closed when the
conference is full. Register early to avoid missing out.

International Workshop \An Introduction to Geometric
Morphometrics using R"
October 5-9, 2015 @ CIBIO-InBIO, Vairao, Portugal
The analysis of organismal shape is central to many
questions in ecology and evolution. This workshop aims
at providing an introduction to the theory and meth-
ods of geometric morphometrics for analyzing variation
in shape and its covariation with other variables. It
will provide an overview of the theory underlying the
quantication of shape using landmark methods, and
a practical guide to data acquisition, standardization
for obtaining shape variables, statistical treatment of
shape variation, and visualization of the results in the
R language for statistical programming.
R knowledge is a requirement for the course and it will
be assumed that all participants are uent for data ma-
nipulation and basic operations in the R environment.

Applications are invited for a PhD fellow-
ship/scholarship at Graduate School of Science
and Technology, Aarhus University, Denmark, within
the Bioscience programme. The position is available
from 1 November 2015 or later.
Title:
Nutritional stress and thermal adaptation
Research area and project description:
Evolutionary genetics, ecophysiology and molecular bi-
ology
The PhD student should study eects of variable nu-
tritional regimes and interactions between nutrition,
temperature and genotype on stress resistance and life
history traits using Drosophila as a model organism. It
is intended to use rearing and test conditions that are
ecological relevant making the studies of strong interest
from ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Relevant
molecular work should complement organismal pheno-
typic analyses, possibly followed up by the application
of relevant omics techniques.
The work will be done under the supervision of Prof.
Volker Loeschcke (AU) in collaboration with Prof. MSO
Torsten N. Kristensen from Aalborg University and in

BielefeldU MammalNatHist
PhD studentship: the natural history of inbreeding in a
cooperative mammal
Supervisors: Dr. Joe Homan (Bielefeld University, Ger-
many) and Dr Hazel Nichols (Liverpool John Moores
University, UK)
This PhD studentship will investigate the causes and
consequences of inbreeding in the banded mongoose
Mungos mungo; a cooperatively breeding African mam-
mal. Recent studies (Nichols et al 2012, Nichols et al
2014) have shown that inbreeding occurs regularly in
this species, with around 9% of pups being the prod-
uct of father-daughter or brother-sister matings. This
frequency of inbreeding is highly unusual in a wild popu-
lation, so this species presents us with a rare opportunity
to investigate the causes and consequences of inbreeding.
The studentship will address the following questions:
1. What are the drivers of inbreeding? In particu-
lar, what are the social factors that shape inbreeding
behaviour, and whether the propensity to inbreed is
heritable?
1. Is inbreeding avoided, and if so, how? Here, you will
investigate whether banded mongooses may be able to
recognise relatives on the basis of dispersal, familiarity
or phenotype matching (e.g. scent).
1. What are consequences of inbreeding in a cooperative
mammal? Here, you will explore the tension between in-
breeding depression and kin- selected helping behaviour.
At its most basic level, inbreeding increases relatedness
between group members, which may in turn increase the
benets of cooperation. Consequently, inbreeding could
have important impacts on the distribution of helpingbehaviour within social groups.
During your PhD, you will use multigenerational data
from a long-term study of the banded mongoose. We
will exploit a large existing molecular dataset of around
2000 individuals genotyped at 40 microsatellite loci to-
gether with a large multigenerational pedigree. This will
be used to establish levels of inbreeding and relatedness,
which in turn will be linked to detailed individual-based
behavioural and phenotypic data collected continuously
over almost two decades. There will also be the oppor-
tunity for eldwork at the study site in Uganda.
We seek a bright and highly motivated student who
holds a good rst degree and an M.Sc. or equivalent
in a relevant topic (e.g. animal behaviour, evolution-
ary, conservation or quantitative genetics). The ideal
candidate will have strong quantitative skills (including
prociency in R) and ideally some experience of working
with pedigree data. The candidate should also be able
to work both independently and as part of a multidisci-
plinary team. A high standard of spoken and written
English is required.
The student will be jointly registered at the Department
of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University, Germany
(www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/vhf/index.html) and
the School of Natural Sciences and Psychology,
Liverpool John Moore's University (LJMU), UK
(https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/faculties/faculty-
of-science/school-of-natural-sciences-and-psychology).
The department of Animal Behaviour in Bielefeld is
the oldest of its kind in Germany and currently hosts
six principal investigators, seven postdocs and twenty
PhD students. It oers a stimulating international
environment and an excellent research infrastructure
including a brand new molecular laboratory. The
working language of the Department is English. The
School of Natural Sciences at Liverpool John Moores
University is a diverse, interdisciplinary School with
almost 100 academic sta. We have excellent facilities,
with a large suite of newly refurbished molecular labs,
and a wide range of expertise crossing the elds of
behaviour, genetics, biochemistry and neurobiology.
Both Universities oer a supportive environment with
regular seminars, research group meetings and academic
events. You will also have the opportunity to interact
with cooperation partner Prof Mike Cant (University of
Exeter), and to attend regular conict and cooperation
group-meetings at the University of Cambridge.
Bielefeld is a small city with an attractive historical
centre and easy access to the Teutoberger Wald for hik-
ing and other outdoor pursuits. It oers a very high
standard of living and is well connected to most major
European cities. Liverpool is a large, dynamic and cul-August 1, 2015 EvolDir 11
tured city with a UNESCO world heritage water-front.
It is an aordable and pleasant city to live in and is also
close to the attractive beaches and nature reserves of
the Wirral and Sefton Coast.
You will spend approximately half of your time in Biele-
feld and half in Liverpool (although you will have some
exibility here). A joint PhD will provide you with an
excellent opportunity for international travel

DeakinU ParrotDiseaseEvol
We are seeking two outstanding, highly motivated PhD
candidates to work on the Australian Research Coun-
cil (ARC) Linkage funded research project \Threats
of avian pathogens to endangered parrots and human
health: developing and utilizing tools for risk reduc-
tion". This project commencing in 2015, is a partner-
ship between Deakin University's Centre for Integrative
Ecology, Deakin University's Medical School, Zoos Vic-
toria, the Victorian State Government's Department of
Environment and Primary Industries, Charles Sturt Uni-
versity and the Geelong Centre for Emerging Infectious
Diseases.
Emerging infectious diseases are among the most sig-
nicant threats to conservation, agriculture and public
health worldwide. Among these are two globally sig-
nicant avian pathogens, Chlamydia psittaci and Beak
and Feather Disease Virus. Both pathogens infect pri-
marily parrots, which are also amongst the most highly
threatened bird groups in the world. We will study
these pathogens in a range of Australian parrot species,
focussing in particular on the crimson rosella as a model
species, and the critically endangered orange bellied par-
rot. The aims of this research program are to determine
transmission dynamics and the role of environmental
reservoirs of infection, quantify the tness costs of infec-
tion, and test the roles of genetic diversity of both hosts
and pathogens in infection and disease emergence. We
also aim to determine the extent to which zoonotic trans-
mission of C. psittaci to free-range poultry or humans
is related to infection in wild birds.
PhD Project 1: This PhD project will be primarily
eld based and will involve the collection of samplesfrom wild birds and their environments (e.g. nest sites)
and measure breeding success and survival. This project
may involve work on several Australia parrot species but
with a focus on crimson rosellas (Platycercus elegans).
PhD Project 2: This PhD project will focus on genetic
analysis of parrot DNA samples to identify infected
individuals using PCR-based assays and to sequence
pathogens and their host birds to elucidate transmission
pathways and the roles of genetic diversity in infection
and disease progression. The samples will be derived
from wild parrot populations, including the critically
endangered orange-bellied parrot and other species im-
plicated in possible zoonotic transmission to humans or
free-range poultry. There will also be some scope for
eld work in this project.
Both projects will be working with Professor Andy
Bennett, Dr Matt Berg, Dr Ken Walder, and where
appropriate, other members of the research grant
team. For further information on the research group,

JamesCookU Chytriiomycosis
2 PhD opportunities to study virulence of chytridiomy-
cosis at James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland,
Australia
Chytridiomycosis has caused amphibian declines and
extinctions globally as it has spread through na ve pop-
ulations. It is now endemic in much of its suitable range
in Australia where it still causes high mortality rates
and threatens amphibian biodiversity. We have funds to
investigate mechanisms of virulence and how virulence
of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is evolving as
it adapts to new habitats. One project is focussed on
how Bd causes disease and will involve bioassays, toxin
identication and possibly gene knockouts. The second
project involves comparing Australian Bd strains to as-
sess growth characteristics and virulence. Both projects
may involve frog transmission experiments. The stu-
dents will be able to pursue areas of interest within this
framework.
The candidates will be part of the enthusiastic and
supportive One Health Research Group at JCU, see
http://www.jcu.edu.au/cphmvs/public-health-tropical-
medicine/JCU 10 7907.html and Facebook:https:/-
/www.facebook.com/onehealthresearchgroup/ .The
projects are multidisciplinary and involve collaborators
such as Qld Institute of Medical Research in Brisbane.
The outcomes of the projects are likely to lead to the
improved conservation of amphibian biodiversity and
may contribute to theories on host/pathogen dynamics.
The selected applicants would need to apply for an APA
or international PhD scholarship (due 31 Aug). Please
see http://www.jcu.edu.au/grs/scholarships/index.htm
Ideal PhD candidates will have: 1 ^st class honours or
equivalent research credentials in a relevant discipline
such as biology or veterinary science majoring in micro-
biology, biochemistry, molecular biology or pathology.2. Demonstrated publication record in high impact jour-
nals 4. Demonstrated interpersonal and communication
skills.

The Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research
(IZW) in the Forschungsverbund Berlin e. V. (www.izw-
berlin.de) together with the Research Institute of
Wildlife Ecology (FIWI) at the University of Veteri-
nary Medicine, Vienna (www.vetmeduni.ac.at/wi), the
Weierstra Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochas-
tics (WIAS, www.wias-berlin.de), the Institut for Virol-
ogy of the Freie Universit at Berlin (FU, www.vetmed.fu-
berlin.de) and the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecol-
ogy and Inland Fisheries (IGB, www.igb-berlin.de) have
formed a consortium to implement the AQUAVIR
project funded by the Leibniz Association.
Water is required for life. We have accumulated evi-
dence suggesting it may be an overlooked viral vector.
In climatic zones with seasonally limited precipitation
such as east Africa and central Asia, animals congregate
at high densities at scarce water sources. We hypothe-
size that viruses shed in water in this ecological setting
would gain a tness advantage if they evolved traits
permitting the retention of their infectivity in water and
a reduction in host specicity. The AQUAVIR project
will determine whether water is a signicant viral vector
and how viruses behave mechanistically in such settings,
and develop mathematical models to understand the
epidemiology and evolution of this phenomenon. We
therefore seek to ll the following position: doctoral stu-
dent in evolutionary disease ecology: African waterholes
Specic tasks: Determine the distribution, persistence
and species usage of transient water sources; determine
the eect of water source characteristics on virus pres-
ence; non-invasively determine if physiological stress,
reproduction or lactation are correlated with virus excre-August 1, 2015 EvolDir 13
tion in zebras; analyse environmental DNA of water sam-

sequence diversity obtained directly from animals com-
pared to their drinking sources. This is a team project
consisting of 2 doctoral students and 2 postdoctoral
researchers with the overall goal of understanding the
potential role of water as a viral vector. However, each
position represents an independent project. Though
independent, the successful candidate will be expected
to collaborate intensively with all members of the team.
Requirements: A completed master's/diploma degree
in biological sciences; clean driver's licence; competence
in statistical methods; ability to work independently in
challenging environments and to interact with scientists
from a wide variety of elds; strong interest in wildlife,
conservation and evolutionary biology; a background
in ecology. Those candidates with previous experience
with wildlife, experience in eld research and o-road
driving experience will have an advantage.
The position will be supervised by Prof Alex Greenwood
(IZW Dept of Wildlife Diseases) and Dr Marion L East
(IZW Dept of Evolutionary Ecology).
Applications and working environment
In our consortium we oer state-of-the-art methodology
and a stimulating international research environment
within an interdisciplinary, collaborative context. The
doctoral positions are initially limited to two years, with
the possibility for extension to a maximum of three years.
The position will start on September 1, 2015. Salary is
according to TV oD (65%). As a member of the Leib-
niz Association, and lead institution of the AQUAVIR
consortium, the IZW is an equal opportunity employer,
determined to increase the proportion of women in suc-
cessful scientic careers, and particularly encourages
women to apply. Preference will be given to disabled
applicants with the same qualications.

MonashU 2 EvolutionaryChange
Two PhD projects will be oered from 2016 in the
Evolutionary Ecology of Environmental Change re-
search group at Monash University, Australia (https://-
sites.google.com/site/chapplelab/). The research group
uses eld studies, eld- and lab-based experiments, com-
parative analyses, morphological analyses and molecular
approaches to examine the impact of past, current, and
future environmental change on phenotype, life-history
and distribution. We use squamate reptiles as model
systems.
The successful students will be able to develop a project
in one of three research areas:
Egernia Group lizards. The Egernia Group (Egernia,
Liopholis, Lissolepis, Bellatorias, Tiliqua, Corucia) is an
endemic Australasian lineage of large-sized skinks that
exhibit stable social aggregations and long-term social
and genetic monogamy. We are examining the evolu-
tion of sociality and mating systems within the group,along with studies on the evolution and maintenance of
dietary preferences and colour pattern polymorphism.
This project will be supported by an ARC Discovery
Grant, and involve collaboration with Geo While (Uni-
versity of Tasmania) and Mike Gardner (Flinders Uni-
versity). Macroecology and comparative analyses. We
use comparative methods to investigate the ecology and
evolution of squamate reptiles. Our research is focused
in areas including i) conservation and extinction risk, ii)
the interplay between morphology, ecology, ecophysiol-
ogy, life-history and the environment, and iii) invasion
biology and biosecurity. This project will involve col-
laboration with Shai Meiri (Tel Aviv University, Israel;
http://shaimeirilab.weebly.com/). Delicate skink (Lam-
propholis delicata). The delicate skink is one of the most
abundant and widespread vertebrates in eastern Aus-
tralia, occurring from North Queensland to Tasmania.
It is also the only Australian lizard that has successfully
established overseas, with invasive populations in the
Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand, and Lord Howe Island.
We are examining the role of behaviour in the introduc-
tion process, intraspecic hybridisation in the invasive
range, thermal biology, learning and cognition, colour
pattern polymorphism, and its impact on native species.
In addition, we are completing a range of comparative
analyses on other widespread and range-restricted mem-
bers of the genus.
Interested students should email their CV (includ-
ing details of two academic referees), academic
record, and research interests to Dr David Chapple
(David.Chapple@monash.edu, Ph: 03 9905 3015) by

Job description
The subject of the PhD project will address the genomic
foundations of cryptic speciation in marine interstitial
invertebrates. The detection of cryptic species is ex-
ponentially increasing in the past two decades. This
includes many interstitial species living in the space
between the sand grains, for which the \Meiofauna para-
dox" is long known. That is, morphological identical
species with very limited dispersal capacities exhibit
a global distribution. The paradox is related to cryp-
tic speciation, but several aspects are unknown. 1)
What is driving speciation? 2) How strongly is gene
ow limited between populations? 3) Does sympatry
of cryptic species occur? 4) Why are the species mor-
phologically static? These questions shall be addressed
using European populations from the interstitial poly-
chaete Stygocapitella subterranea as a model system.
Population and evolutionary genomic approaches will
be explored to assess gene ow, signatures of dierent
selection regimes and phylogeography.
The project will be based on morphological and molec-
ular methods. NHM have access to modern DNA-
laboratory facilities. The PhD will be associated with
the professor of evolutionary genomics at NHM, Torsten
Struck.
Requirements * We seek a person with strong motivation

SwanseaU EvolMicrobialGenomics
PhD studentship in Evolutionary Microbial Genomics
and Immunology (Swansea University, UK)
General description: Research will be conducted under
the direct supervision of Professor Samuel K. Sheppard
and Dr. Thomas Wilkinson and based in the Depart-
ment of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases
at the Swansea University School of Medicine (United
Kingdom). The successful student will join a team of
multi-disciplinary scientists working in the MRC Cloud
Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB)
Centre and the BBSRC-funded medical mass spectrom-
etry team. More information on the research group can
be found on http://www.sheppardlab.com/ . Project
details: The project will focus and link two major areas
of host pathogen interactions: i) the cellular response
of the organism and host; ii) the population genomics
of microbes so that host responses specic to a species
or evolutionary conserved lineages of pathogens can be
identied.
Early and rapid detection of infection is a major goal of
Clinical Microbiology. In particular an ability to dier-
entiate between sepsis and other non-infectious causes of
systemic inammation such as Systemic Inammatory
Response Syndrome (SIRS) is particularly pertinent as
it will determine antibiotic administration. Recently,
we and others have identied 25-hydroxycholesterol as
an important inammatory mediator regulating the pro-
duction of pro-inammatory IL-1 driven responses. To
date these studies have linked inammation with the
antiviral interferon response. In this context less is
known about 25-hydroxycholesterol and bacterial in-
fection. This project will investigate whether major
bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus,
Campylobacter and Escherichia coli generate unique
metabolic signatures of 25-hydroxycholesterol and its
degradation products. We will use the whole genome
data of over 5,000 bacterial isolates organised in ouronline databases to select the major disease causing
clones for host / pathogen whole blood modelling prior
to Mass Spectrometry analysis of isolated sera.
Requirements: Enthusiasm and practical experience in
evolutionary biology, immunology, microbiology, molec-
ular techniques and computer-based genetic analysis is
necessary but training and support will be provided to
strengthen these areas. The successful candidate will
be highly motivated, creative, independent and have a
good degree in immunology, molecular biology, microbi-
ology, bioinformatics, genetics or ecology (BSc or MSc,
2:1 or 1st only). Previous experience in a molecular
biology/immunology laboratory or in bioinformatics re-
search is also strongly desirable. Good English writing
and oral skills are essential.
Details: - The duration of the studentship is 3 years
(2016-2019). - The position is open until lled, but a pre-
ferred deadline for application is 30th September 2015
to allow for registration to start in the Winter semester.
- The position is fully open for UK and EU students only.
- Salary will be commensurate with regular UK post-
graduate stipends, i.e. ?13,863/year ( ~?18,425/year),
tax-free. - Tuition fees are fully covered by the stu-
dentship. - Students will also have opportunities to
attend national and international conferences during
their candidature and a chance to compete for internal
Medical School travel bursaries.

Title: Towards genotype-based monitoring for fungicide
resistance management

erence: SAUNDERS G15ICASE Application deadline:

PhD - 4 year Project Funding: BBSRC ICASE
Project Summary
Evolved resistance to fungicides is a major threat to
global food security. Fungicide resistance increases dis-
ease losses and imposes higher costs on growers and the
fungicide industry. The implementation of validated
resistance management strategies for the maximisation
of the eective life of existing and new fungicides is of
the upmost importance. These strategies involve the
use of mixtures and alternation so that selection and
rate of resistance evolution is reduced.
A key aspect of these strategies is the monitoring of
pathogen populations and epidemics so as to measure
the prevalence and impact of resistance. To date, mon-
itoring strongly relates to phenotypic data; i.e. eld
trials are carried out and pathogen isolates are tested
for decreased sensitivity. Whilst there will always be a
need for phenotyping, the cost in time and money limits
the eectiveness of such methods.
Recent advances in gene and genome sequencing meth-
ods have brought us to the point where genotypic moni-
toring might be considered as a rst line of investigation.
The Saunders group at The Genome Analysis Centre in
partnership with the John Innes Centre have recently
developed an eective method based on next-generation
sequencing techniques to genotype pathogen popula-
tions at high resolution. The PhD student will use
these existing techniques to develop an eective, rapid
genotyping platform specically focused on monitoring
genes targeted by fungicides for mutations that have
been shown to induce resistance. Furthermore, the im-
plications of any novel mutations will be investigated
using lab-based assays established in the Oliver groupat Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia.
This project provides a unique opportunity for the stu-
dent to undertake multidisciplinary research, embedded
within The Genome Analysis Centre that is a hub for
innovative bioinformatics to support all computational
aspects of the project and within the John Innes Centre
that is an international centre of excellence in plant
science to support laboratory-based experiments. The
student will also work closely with the Oliver group
at Curtin University who are renowned experts in the
eld of fungicide resistance. In addition, as an ICP
CASE student they will also work closely with Syngenta
a world leader in fungal disease control, at their Stein
Laboratory in Switzerland. The student will spend a
minimum of 3 months at Syngenta during the course of
their PhD.

UAntwerp EvolutionParentalCare
The Faculty of Sciences, Department Biology-Ethology
of the University of Antwerp seeks to ll the following
vacancy (m/f): Ph.D. student in Behavioural Ecology
Job description: Parental care increases ospring sur-
vival, but entails tness costs for the parents too. The
resulting trade-o between investing in current ospring
or in self-maintenance is a central tenet of life-history
theory. But these costs and benets vary with multiple
environmental factors. When adjusting their level of
investment, parents therefore have to respond to mul-
tiple cues from their ecological and social environment.
Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an individual toalter trait expression in function of the environment,
plays therefore a central role. However, exibility in
parenting may sometimes be constrained, e.g. because
of consistent individual dierences in behavior, such as
any form of foraging specialization. Moreover, parental
decisions will also depend on the contribution to care by
the partner. Parental responsiveness is likely to aect
the eciency of cooperation within pairs, and there-
with ultimately reproductive success. In the proposed
project we will apply sophisticated cross-fostering ex-
periments in a wild population of individually marked
Lesser black-backed gulls, a long-lived migratory species
breeding in a heterogeneous environment. We will make
use novel GPS tracking devices to investigate parental
care in great detail, which we aim to combine with large
scale behavioral observations and state-of-the-art phys-
iological measures. We will apply recently developed
behavioral reaction norm concepts in order to capture
the multidimensional complexity of parental care.
Prole and requirements: . You have a Master degree
in Biology or an equivalent degree in life sciences. . You
are an enthusiastic and motivated student with a strong
interest in Behavioral and Evolutionary Ecology, who
likes working in the eld under at times harsh conditions.
Preferentially you have already experience in eldwork,
but this is not essential. . You have good organiza-
tional, writing and presentation skills and should be
able to work well both independently and in a team
environment.
We oer: . A doctoral scholarship for a period of two
years, with the possibility of renewal for a further two-
year period after positive evaluation, the starting date
is between 1 October 2015 and 1 January 2016. . The
successful applicant will join a young, dynamic and
stimulating group of researchers working on all 4 ma-
jor aspects of animal behaviour (causation, develop-
ment, function, evolution), with particular emphasis on
bird family life (maternal eects, phenotypic plasticity,

A PhD project is available at the University of Can-
berra studying the drivers of ne scale genetic spatial
structuring in aquatic organisms in eastern Australia
with a focus on the Murray-Darling Basin, Lake Eyre
Basin and Clarence River system. Our central aim is
to determine the spatial scale at which species are ge-
netically structured in riverine ecosystems. The spatial
scale of population substructuring provides indirect es-
timates of the degree of mixing between populations
and the speed at which recolonisation occurs in stream
reaches following extirpation events, and so is a crucial
component of the management of aquatic ecosystems
and of restoration eorts. Despite its importance, ge-
netic research across varying spatial scales is lacking
for most aquatic species and river basins. Specically,
this project will address three questions: 1) How does
genetic structure within aquatic species vary across the
riverine landscape at the spatial scales of river reaches,
tributaries, major rivers and drainage basins? 2) Do
more complex dendritic riverine networks show greater
intra-specic genetic structure than linear systems at
the same scale, and if so, why? 3) How has variation
in uvial geomorphic characteristics and current and
long-term climatic variation inuenced connectivity and
the spatial scale in structuring riverine fauna over the
last~100,000 years?
We are collecting SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)
data for thousands of loci via next-generation sequencing
for multiple species including shes, turtles and shrimps
from several focal catchments that have a range of den-
dritic structures across an aridity gradient with a variety
of uvial geomorphic characteristics and histories.
The options for the specic PhD research questions are
somewhat open, but projects would be expected to focus
on developing and extending connectivity models that
compare dierent network structures and incorporating
and analysis our SNP datasets with these models. A
strong background in modelling (knowledge in computer
programming, statistical and spatial analysis using R) is
important, while knowledge of genetic data, while help-
ful is not crucial. The PhD project is part of a recently
successfully granted ARC Linkage project; the detailedproject description is available on request. Students
would be supervised by some combination of Bernd Gru-
ber, Peter Unmack, Duanne White or Arthur Georges
and others, depending on the nal project details.
IMPORTANT POINTS: 1. This project and the PhD
candidature will be administered through the University
of Canberra. You will need to have completed a BSc and
some subsequent form of research-focussed degree (an
MSc, or in the Australian/New Zealand system, an Hon-
ours year) to be considered. 3. If you are an Australian
or New Zealand citizen or Australian permanent resi-
dent, you would be eligible to be considered for an APA
Stipend Scholarship, and would be eligible for exemption
from tuition fee payments under the Australian Gov-
ernment's Research Training Scheme (RTS). An APA
stipend scholarship is currently valued at $28,549pa. A
small number of top-up Scholarships valued at $5,000
pa are also available. 4. If you are not an Australian or
New Zealand citizen or Australian permanent resident,
unless you are the recipient of a competitive merit based
scholarship, you will be liable for upfront fees, at a rate
of approximately $AUS 20k p.a.

PhD STUDENT POSITION IN FISH EVOLUTION-
ARY ECOLOGY
Alternative life histories: evolutionary ecology and eco-
physiology of facultative anadromy in Brown Trout
Understanding how and why individuals develop strik-
ingly dierent phenotypes and life histories in variable
environments is a major goal in evolutionary ecology.
It is also a prerequisite for conserving important bio-
diversity within species and predicting the impacts of
environmental change and management interventions on
natural populations. This PhD will form part of a larger
ERC-funded research program to understand the causes
and consequences of ^ afacultative anadromy^ a in brown
trout (Salmo trutta), the phenomenon whereby some
individuals in a population migrate to the sea for part
of their lives, while others remain resident in freshwater
and never go to sea.
The aim of this 4-year PhD will be to relate variation
in trout life histories to variation in energy acquisition
and allocation (i.e. energy budgets). For example, the
balance between metabolic requirements during growth
and available extrinsic resources has been hypothesised
to act as the major physiological driver of migration deci-
sions in species that exhibit partial migration. The work
will involve large-scale experiments where trout from dif-
ferent populations are exposed to dierent environments,
in order to understand how genes and environment inter-
actively determine alternative life histories. The project
will involve both lab work and eld work in Ireland and
will apply modern physiological and genetic techniques
within an evolutionary ecology conceptual framework.
The student will be supervised by Dr Thomas Reed
(School of BEES) and will work in a growing team of
salmonid researchers, with a broad network of collabo-
rators across academic and governmental institutionsin Ireland and abroad. The student will be based at
the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sci-
ences (BEES) at University College Cork (UCC) in the
south of Ireland, which oers a vibrant and diverse re-
search environment. Cork is a dynamic, cosmopolitan
and culturally-diverse coastal city with beautiful land-
scapes and diverse options for outdoors pursuits on its
doorstep.
Candidates should possess at minimum a 2.1 BSc (Hons)
degree in a relevant discipline (e.g. Ecology, Zoology,
Physiology). Applicants must be self? \motivated with
good numerical, communication, organisational and
writing skills. Experience working with sh would be
advantageous but not essential. The studentship is open

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY, INSTITUTE OF ECOL-
OGY, UNIVERSITY OF INNSBRUCK PhD student
position in Wolbachia transinfection
We seek to hire a PhD student with training in ecologi-
cal and especially molecular-biological methods; some
research experience with arthropods and/or Wolbachia
or other bacterial endosymbionts would be an asset but
is not required. The position is a 48-months position at
the Molecular Ecology group of the Institute of Ecology,
starting from 1 October 2015; for details, see below.
Focusing on the Alpine Space, the group's mission
is interdisciplinary research, embedded in interna-
tional collaboration networks. A list of research top-
ics can be found at: http://www.uibk.ac.at/ecology/-
forschung/molecular ecology.html.en . ***Responsibili-
ties*** 1. transinfecting the climate-change study sys-
tem Drosophila nigrosparsa with Wolbachia 2. charac-
terising endosymbiont phenotype(s), e.g. cytoplasmic
incompatibility, sex ratio distortion 3. characterising
endosymbiont tropism(s) 4. evaluating endosymbiont in-
uence on host life history traits 5. evaluating endosym-
biont inuence on host gene expression using Illumina
sequencing (RNA-seq) 6. manuscript writing 7. contact
and collaboration with scientists at other Austrian and
international research facilities 8. teaching 1 hour/week
***Selection criteria*** A. MSc degree or equivalent
graduation B. published research experience in biology
C. proven lab skills in molecular biology and/or mi-
croscopy; skills in handling small and delicate samples
D. basic knowledge in bioinformatics, e.g. sequence
assembly, GenBank search algorithms, NGS analysis
pipelines, scripting E. ability to work as part of a multi-
disciplinary team F. ability to work independently G.
very good knowledge of English
***Salary*** The annual gross salary is Euro 18,634.
The contract includes full social (health, unemployment,
annuity) insurance and 5 weeks of holidays annually.
***Project details*** In an ongoing project, we have
developed the alpine y Drosophila nigrospasa towards
a model system for evolution of heat tolerance in moun-
tain arthropods and have thoroughly characterised its
life history traits. We published an annotated tran-
scriptome of the species, and the genome will become
available in due course. Maternally inherited bacte-
rial endosymbionts like Wolbachia and Spiroplasma are
widespread in insects and able to alter their host's re-
production and tness. Our lab has key experience in
the study of Wolbachia in various hosts and was the
organiser of the 8th International Wolbachia Conference
in 2014. As far as known today, Drosophila nigrosparsa
is free of endosymbionts but likely to come in close con-
tact with other, endosymbiont-infected dipterans dueto increasing temperatures in the alpine environment.
Thus, natural horizontal transfer of Wolbachia into D.
nigrosparsa might occur in the future. The successful
candidate will perform an in-depth assay of the bacterial
fauna of D. nigrosparsa and transfer Wolbachia (and
maybe other endosymbionts) into laboratory strains of
D. nigrosparsa using egg cytoplasma microinjection. Af-
ter successful transinfection, the y lines will be used
to study tropism, phenotypes, and life history trait al-
terations of the novel endosymbiont/host interaction in
the laboratory.
***How to apply*** To apply, please submit via the job
portal of the university at http://orawww.uibk.ac.at/-

tion.August 1, 2015 EvolDir 23
A 5-year Phd position is available in Human
Evolution/Cooperation/Life-history/Economics at De-
partment of Ecology and Evolution of the University of
Lausanne.
Human life history compared to other primate is marked
by an exceptional long lifespan and capacity for indi-
vidual and social learning. This raises a number of
questions pertaining to the co-evolution of life-history,
cognition, and cultural transmission. How should in-
dividuals trade o allocation of resources to learning,
growth, and reproduction? What is the role of ecolog-
ical and social pressure for investment into increased
cognition? How does adaptive cultural knowledge accu-
mulate over lifespan? Do intergenerational transfer and
longevity aect this and how?
The aim of the Phd is to study such questions from
a theoretical point of view. Applicants should have
a master degree in a relevant area (e.g. evolutionary
biology, population genetics, economics, game theory,
physics, or mathematics), with strong mathematical and
computing skills, and a vivid interest in fundamental
research.
Inquiries and applications should be sent to Prof. Lau-
rent Lehmann: laurent.lehmann@unil.ch by August
1st, and should include a CV, a one-page statement
of research interests, and names of 2-3 referees. Only
applications with all these information will be con-
sidered. For further information please contact lau-

UmeaU UngulateEvolution
I am advertising a PhD position in animal community
ecology, partly using molecular methods. I think this
position could be of interest for the readers of evoldir.
Joris
The department of Wildlife, Fish & Environmental stud-
ies (SLU, Umea, Sweden) oers a fully funded PhD
project in Animal Community Ecology.
Beyond Moose: community ecology of Sweden's novel
diverse ungulate communities
Project descriptionSweden's ungulate communities have changed dramat-
ically, resulting from introductions of non-native (e.g.,
fallow deer) and native ungulates (e.g., wild boar) and
expansion of ranges northwards beyond historic distri-
butions due to milder winters. We lack a comprehen-
sive understanding of the functioning of these novel
diverse ungulate communities in landscapes modied
by humans. The Swedish EPA has funded our program
Beyond Moose to increase this understanding and to
move from single- to multispecies wildlife management.
This also feeds into the international discussion on how
to manage increasing ungulate communities throughout
Europe and North America. The PhD will study trophic
interactions among species, and eects on individual
and population performance, for varying ungulate com-
munity compositions and along gradients of land use
practices. The project combines eld methods with
state of the art DNA tools. Results will be crucial for
nding trade-os among competing ecosystem services
such as game meat and recreation from hunting vs. ber
from forests and food from crops. The PhD student
will closely collaborate with an advertised PhD posi-
tion in the Governance project that focuses on social
dimensions of multi-species wildlife management.
Qualications
The applicant should have an MSc degree in Ecology or
similar discipline. We are looking for a candidate that
is prepared to combine extended eld work periods with
work in the lab (DNA analyses) as well as complex data
analyses, such as bioinformatics. Documented skills in
one or more of these three aspects are highly valued.
The candidate should be uent in spoken and written
English. The candidate should be able to work indepen-
dently as well as in a team. Experience in writing and
publishing scientic papers is a plus.

UMelbourne AdaptationGenomics
PhD Project Available (Commencing 2016)
School of BioSciences, The University of Melbourne,
VIC, Australia, 3010
Adaptation genomics: the genetic architecture of colour
polymorphism and speciation
We are seeking a PhD student to work on an ARC-
funded project investigating the genetics underpinning
discrete colour morphs in a species of lizard.
To understand the speciation process, we need to under-
stand how selection acts on traits involved in reproduc-
tive isolation (e.g. colour variation), and how this relates
to the underlying genetic architecture. The project will
utilise a well-characterised system with two genetically
and phenotypically discrete lineages, the tawny dragon
lizard. The species is polymorphic and lineages dier
most notably in throat coloration (see gure below).
The main aims are to determine the nature of reproduc-
tive isolation between lineages, identify genes associated
with colour morphs and investigate whether these gene
regions are also involved in the process of speciation.
The PhD project may involve eldwork in semi-arid
South Australia as well as captive maintenance of tawny
dragons, laboratory work and/or bioinformatics depend-
ing on the student's main interests.
The student will need to obtain an Australian Post-
graduate Award (APA; $25,849 per annum, or an IPRS
for international students) through The University of
Melbourne; therefore a rst class Honours or Masters
Degree and/or evidence of publishing in international
peer-reviewed scientic journals are essential. Expe-
rience in bioinformatics and/or working with lizards
would be a bonus.
Interested applicants please submit: 1) a brief cover let-
ter outlining your research interests, 2) a comprehensive
CV, 3) academic transcript and 4) contact details of
two referees (including a previous research supervisor).

Project 1: Genetic assessment of threats to platypus due
to river modication. The iconic platypus is classed as
?near-threatened? despite its wide distribution in East-
ern Australia. The genetic work forms part of a larger
ARC-funded project to assess and model threats and
then to implement decision analyses that focus eective
conservation actions. We will use genetic methods to
assess population structure and movements, in platypus
upstream and downstream, in pairs of rivers with dier-

next-generation genotyping-by-sequencing, microsatel-
lites, and mitochondrial DNA is desirable. Experience
in eld work would be an advantage. A full driver?s
licence is desirable.
Project 2: Forecasting and managing biodiversity. We
have produced new biodiversity theory, based on infor-
mation theory (eg, Molecular Ecology 15:2857). The
PhD student would apply this theory to a wide range of
existing datasets in genetic and community biodiversity,
using data from koalas, dolphins, ies, trees and various
other species. The student would also be encouraged to
further develop this theory in response to ndings from
the data analysis. A range of skills and interests can
be accommodated. Biologists who are comfortable with
rst-year undergraduate mathematics would nd this
work rewarding. Also, applicants from a maths/physics

RedSquirrelLifeHistory
Funded Ph.D. position on life history ecology of red
squirrels.
I am currently advertising one Ph.D. student opening
in my lab (www.lanelab.ca) in the Department of Biol-
ogy at the University of Saskatchewan, ideally to begin
September, 2015 (January or April, 2016 start dates
may also be feasible). Full funding ($20k CAD/yr for 4
years) is guaranteed, but the successful student will be
expected to apply for any funding for which they may
be eligible (e.g., NSERC post-graduate scholarships for
Canadian citizens).
The Project: Life history ecology of North American
red squirrels (Ph.D.)
The Kluane Red Squirrel Project (KRSP; http://-
redsquirrel.biology.ualberta.ca/) was established in the
late 1980's and now represents one of the longest running
and most-comprehensive studies of a wild mammal in
the world. Researchers from multiple universities are in-
volved and exciting collaborations have produced many
important, interdisciplinary ndings. A clear strength
of this project stems from our ability to link the biology
of the population with a key environmental driver (avail-
ability of their primary food source - white spruce seed,
cached as cones). The advertised project will investigate
the causes and consequences of phenological variation
(i.e., annual timing of key life cycle events) and how this
variation ts within the broader life history phenotypesof individual squirrels. Phenological shifts are now the
most often cited ecological responses to climate change
and can have substantial consequences for individual t-
ness and population viability. The proje ct will combine
analyses of our long-term data set (comprising data on
>10,000 individuals, collected over 10 generations and
25 years) with new eld data collection. Quantitative
genetics analyses will be used to estimate heritabilities
and genetic correlations (i.e., evolutionary potential)
in phenological traits and opportunities are available
to collaborate with other researchers in energetic phys-
iology, population ecology, endocrinology and animal
behaviour. All eldwork will occur in the spectacular
southwest Yukon Territory at KRSP's eld camp.

PhD-Position: Dept. of Forest Genetics, BFW, Vienna,
Austria Genetic variation of disease resistance of the
Common Ash against the pathogen Hymenoscyphus
pseudoalbidus
The Department of Forest Genetics at the Federal Re-
search and Training Centre for Forests, Natural Hazards
and Landscape (BFW) in Vienna (Austria) is inviting
applications for a PhD Position to study the genetic
variation of disease resistance of common ash against the
cause of the European-wide ash dieback, the pathogen
Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus. The PhD candidate
will use quantitative- and molecular-genetic approaches
to identify disease resistant genotypes, to understand
the geographical pattern of resistance, and to select
genotypes for breeding programmes. The PhD will work
in a joint project between the BFW and the University
of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (Department of
Forest Entomology, Forest Pathology and Forest Pro-
tection).
We look for a highly enthusiastic PhD student with
interest in molecular and quantitative genetics, forest
pathology and tree breeding, preferably with previous
experience in any of these research areas. A high level of
self-organization skill is expected. All our projects are
highly integrative and require willingness to embrace
multiple disciplines within the domain of forest genetics.
Requirements:
- Master in Forestry, Forest or Plant Pathology, Biology,
Nature conservation or related sciences
- Fluent spoken and written English
- Basic knowledge of German- Driving licence
- Ability and willingness for eld and nursery work
The PhD contract is for 4 years (30 h/week) and en-
ables the attendance of PhD courses at the University
of Natural Resources and Life Sciences.
We oer an inspiring research environment, including
state-of-the art research facilities, extensive supervision
and an exciting project with high relevance for nature
conservation and forest management.
The Department of Forest Genetics is located in the
heart of Vienna, close to Schoenbrunn castle. We are
concerned with the analysis of genetic information about
forest trees and other organisms living in the forest and
the dynamics of genetic processes in forest stands. En-
vironmental stress and forest management issues are
also considered. Activities are based on genome re-
search, population genetics and provenance research
(gene ecology). The aim is to translate genetic knowl-
edge into measures for biodiversity enhancement, ge-
netically sustainable management of forests, protection
and management of genetic resources and promotion of
the adaptability and survival of complex forest ecosys-
tems. In addition, the Department deals with breeding
possibilities to increase the productivity and yield of
tree species from plantations. Research projects are
often conducted in close cooperation with other depart-
ments, universities, and forest enterprises in Austria and
abroad.
How to apply: Send a single pdf including a letter of
motivation, a CV with University grades, the names and

GenomicSelectionNaturalEnemies
A PhD student position within the EU-funded Marie
Skodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network BINGO
(Breeding Invertebrates for Next Generation Biocon-
trol) is available at the Laboratory of Genetics and the
Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre of Wageningen
University in the Netherlands.
About the position: The candidate will work on the
development of genome-based selection for the improve-
ment of natural enemies in biocontrol. Intraspecic
genetic variation in arthropods is often studied in the
context of evolution and ecology. Such knowledge can
also be very usefully applied for selection of genotypes
with optimal trait values to develop more eective bio-
control agents. For complex life-history or behavioural
traits that lack easily recordable morphological pheno-
types (i.e. longevity, development time, fecundity), the
selection process can be laborious. Knowledge of the
genomic regions underlying the traits can facilitate the
screening and selection process. Genome-based selection
(GS) methods use information from genome-wide DNA-
markers to eciently select for such complex traits.
While they have been shown to hold great potential
for plant and animal breeding, GS methods have not
yet been applied for the improvement of natural ene-
mies. This project seeks proof-of-principle for the use of
genome-based selection for key life history and natural
enemy traits in the model parasitoid wasp Nasonia vit-
ripennis. The aim is to develop selection protocols for
insect natural enemies and apply these for the genome-
based selection of Nasonia lines for complex life-history
traits. The project will involve: (1) A quantitative
genetics approach, known as (genomic selection,) to ac-
commodate the haplodiploid nature of parasitoids and
other natural enemies; (2) Genomic data generation
and analysis using next-generation sequencing technolo-
gies; (3) Large-scale phenotyping of complex traits in
Nasonia. For more details on this position, see http://-
bit.ly/1D3tcLT Qualications: We seek a bright, highly
motivated, and enthusiastic researcher with a skill set
suitable to the project and who is able to work both
as part of a team and independently. Our ideal can-
didate has a strong quantitative or statistical genetic
background, experience with bioinformatic analysis, and
life-history or behavioural work in insects. You have a
master degree in quantitative genetics, statistical genet-ics, animal or plant breeding, or evolutionary biology,
with a good background in population genetics, bioinfor-
matics, genomics or computational biology. Candidates
from other programs, with a strong interest in the ap-
plication of quantitative methods in genetics are also
invited to apply. Experience with NGS technologies and
genomic data analysis is a plus, but training will be
provided. Insect experimental work will be part of the
project. The language in the lab is English. Therefore, a
high standard of spoken and written English is required.
Eligiblity: Candidates must be, at the time of recruit-
ment by the host organisation, in the rst four years
(full-time equivalent) of their research careers and have
not yet been awarded a doctoral degree. This is mea-
sured from the date when they obtained the degree,
which would formally entitle them to embark on a doc-
torate (e.g. Master degree). Eligible candidates may
be of any nationality but must not, at the time of re-
cruitment have resided or carried out their main activity
(work, studies, et cetera) in The Netherlands for more
than 12 months in the 3 last years immediately prior to
the recruitment date.
BINGO-ITN: The BINGO-ITN is funded by the EU
Horizon2020 programme and involves 12 partners from
academia, non-prot organizations, and biocontrol in-
dustry located in the Netherlands, Germany, France,
Spain, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Greece
and Portugal. BINGO's approach is multidisciplinary,
encompassing a broad range of scientic disciplines,
including the application of state-of-the-art popula-
tion genomics. The BINGO programme combines in-
tegrated training workshops and internship opportu-
nities across the network, with career opportunities
in academia, public or the private sectors. You will
work in close cooperation with PhD students and re-
searchers involved in related BINGO research projects.

SAO PAULO: CHEMICALLY MEDIATED MULTI-
TROPHIC INTERACTION DIVERSITY ACROSS
TROPICAL GRADIENTS:
PROJECT SUMMARY
Overview:
Most known species are involved in chemically mediated
plant-insect-parasitoid interactions, and recent synthe-
ses point to a substantial gap in our understanding of
trophic interaction diversity. This gap will be lled
by our proposed research to examine relationships be-
tween metabolomic, genomic, taxonomic, and interac-
tion diversity of trophic interactions via quantifying
and comparing these dimensions of biodiversity along a
latitudinal gradient and elevational gradients in Brazil
and Argentina. Our focus will be on plants in the genus
Piper (Piperaceae), associated herbivores, and parasitic
wasps and ies. This plant genus is characterized by ex-
tremely high phytochemical and taxonomic diversity, as
are the associated arthropods. The proposed work with
these plants and arthropods will utilize transformative
and innovative approaches to biodiversity research that
allow us to link measures of trophic interaction diver-
sity at an ecologically relevant scale to genetic diversity,
genetic structure, and phytochemical diversity. Uniform
application of quantitative sampling along elevational
gradients, newly developed metabolomics methods, the
latest population genomics tools, and a large scale exper-
iment will make possible tests of emerging hypotheses
about relationships between plant chemistry, special-
ization, climate, and dierent dimensions of diversity,
and will represent the rst large scale, among-site plant-
herbivore-parasitoid food web comparison in the tropics.
Intellectual Merit :
The proposal involves a broad synthesis of molecular
and ecological approaches to the study of species inter-
actions and how they shape and are shaped by multiple
dimensions of diversity. Among the approachesAugust 1, 2015 EvolDir 31

collect DNA of sh from a collection of dierent ponds
and analyze the population structure of these desert sh.
Also, we will be looking at the water conditions and local
adaptations in these sh. This will allow observing the
presence or absence of gene ow between these ponds
through underground freshwater connections. Further-
more, it will be the rst step to nd pond/condition
specic variants that might reveal local adaptation to
certain harsh conditions.
The student will be involved in the eld work, but also

Bioinformatics with Python
Dear all,I would like to announce \Bioinformatics with Python
Cookbook" which I authored.
This book is slightly dierent from the standard books
on Bioinformatics and Python. It is not about teaching
Bioinformatics algorithms. It is also not an introductory
book of Python (you can nd plenty of those elsewhere).August 1, 2015 EvolDir 53
It is about solving practical day-to-day problems with
Python, for example:
Next-Generation Sequencing: FASTQ, BAM and VCF
processing. Along with ltering of datasets.
Genomics: processing reference genomes of both high-
quality references of model species and low-quality non-
model species. Also discussed are genome annotations
and gene ontologies.
Population Genetics: doing PCA, Admixture/Structure,
computing FSTs, ...
Genome simulation: mostly forward-time simulations,
but also a bit of coalescent
Phylogenetics: tree reconstruction and tree drawing
Proteins: PDB processing and visualization.
Other topics like processing map data, GBIF, interfac-
ing with Cytoscape, accessing lots of online databases,
...
There is a bit on interacting with R/Bioconductor via
Python.
Finally we discuss high-performance in Python: faster
algorithms, clusters, Numba and Cython. Also related
technologies like Docker
The book discusses the usual Python Libraries in the
eld: Biopython, PyVCF, Pysam, simuPOP, DendroPy,
Pymol and also scientic libraries like NumPy, SciPy,
matplotlib and scikit-learn.
The code is fully available for free at github https:/-
/github.com/tiagoantao/bioinf-python/blob/master/-
notebooks/Welcome.ipynb I am keen on maintaining
the book code, so if you nd any issues please do
contact me.
The book is available in the usual places (Amazon,
etc.) in paperback and e-book format. The web page
of the book is https://www.packtpub.com/application-

EvolutionMeeting Poster coding
Evolution Meeting Coding Project - Poster Invite Sys-
tem
The organizing committee for the annual Evolu-
tion Meetings (the joint annual meeting of the
ASN/SSB/SSE) is looking to develop a poster-invite
system for future meetings and we're therefore search-
ing for someone (graduate student, pdf, or faculty) who
would be we willing to do some coding to develop this for
us. We're after a simple yet reliable system that looks
nice, works well, that can easily be implemented across
meetings (i.e. plug in a new database and go), and that
can also be modied by others if needed (meaning open
source with well annotated code).
For those not familiar, the basic idea of the poster invite
system is that a week or two before the meeting every-
one that is presenting a poster gets an email explaining
that they can have a personal invite to their poster sent
to up to 3 meeting attendees of their choice. The email
directs them to a website where they can browse a list
of attendees (names and institutions) and select up to
three. Any given attendee can only receive a maximum
of 5 invites, after which they are no longer available
for selection by subsequent poster presenters (it's rst
come-rst serve). After a few days, the system closes
and emails get sent to every attendee that received one
or more invites (up to the max of 5 per attendee). Each
email indicates the name of the person that invited
them, the title of their poster, and the date and time
it is being presented. Past experience indicates that
the majority of people visit posters to which they are
invited, and this system can therefore dramatic ally
alter the benets of giving a poster compared to a talk.
We're willing to oer some nancial compensation,
and/or funds towards attending the next Evolution
meeting in Austin, TX in 2016. However, this should
be considered as much a volunteer service as a job. The
ideal candidate would therefore be a member of one or
more of these societies who values these meetings and
would be interested in improving them.
If you're interested, or would like additional details,
please contact me at hrundle@uottawa.ca. Those inter-
ested are asked to provide some evidence that they havethe appropriate skills.

Shipping treating RNA
I am currently conducting research for my dissertation

Canada to the US for use in comparative transcriptomics
(using a cryo dry-shipper) and I would like to maintain
the highest level of quality since I will be comparing it to
RNA extracted here in the USA. Since it is avian RNA,
it will require \treatment" in order to be cleared for
import. I have been told that the following are all valid
viral inactivation treatments on our current permit:
a) heated to 56C for 3 hours, 60C for 30 minutes, or 100C
for 20 minutes b) subjected to anity chromatography
c) treated with a minimum of 2% SDS for 30 minutes d)
treated with a minimum of 3% beta propiolactone for
12 hours at 4C and pH 7 e) immersed in 10% formalin
f) immersed in a minimum of 70% ethanol g) immersed
in phenol/chloroform h) treated with guanidine HCl i)
treated with proteinase K
I was hoping to extract the RNA using a Qiagen RNeasy
kit and I was wondering if adding proteinase K to the
homogenate would be a reasonable way to treat the
samples? If a better alternative jumps out at you based
on the possible treatment options, please suggest it.

ple types of loci, placed on the same genetic map (QTL,
DMI, deleterious mutations) - An unlimited number of
quantitative traits can be modelled, with pleiotropic loci.
- Selection aecting quantitative traits can vary spatially
and temporally among populations. - Nemo has been
optimized to model migration on very large population
grids using connectivity and migration matrices - And

SouthAfrica VolunteerFieldAssist
StripedMouse
Volunteer opportunity
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to eco-physiology, animal behavior, evolution, and
ecology before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night in
winter, sometimes over 40 ^AC during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of a
small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance of
the research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to theeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1400 (around 180 US$, 110 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$ / 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for one or two volunteers starting in August-October
2015, and for two volunteers starting in December 2015/
January 2016. Volunteers are expected to stay at least
three months, but longer periods of up to 6months are
preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

Switzerland Internship
BatReproduction
Internship for undergraduate/ Master's degree student
for the bat project
Topic: Impact of oxidative stress on alternative repro-
ductive tactics in bats.
Context: Oxidative stress is considered to be a major
mechanism impacting on life history trade-os. Carollia
perspicillata, a neo-tropical bat, shows two reproductive
tactics, with harem males defending a territory, and
bachelor males. Our hypothesis is that bachelor males,
because they have less mating opportunities will invest
more in sperm quality then harem males. The project
is based at the university of Neuch ~Atel, Switzerland.
We study a captive bat colony (Papiliorama http://-
www.papiliorama.ch). Bats can y freely under a 40m-
diameter dome, which includes an articial cave. The
light cycle is reversed, allowing us to work during the
day. Therefore, it is a unique opportunity to study bats,
animals still largely unknown.
Tasks of the intern, in collaboration with the two PhD
students working on the project:
- Planning of the experiment
- Help to feed the bas that are in cages during the
experiment
- Participation in blood and sperm collect
- Behavioral observation
- Possibility of lab work
About the position:
- It can be part of your studies. Therefore, the candidate
is welcome to conduct a personal research project.
- Not paid, but housing could be reimbursed for two
month maximum
- Minimum duration of two months, possibly starting in
September
Please feel free to contact me if you have any ques-
tions. To apply, please send a CV and a cover letter to

UBern Cichlids
InternshipBachelorProject
Internship or Bachelor project for Master/ undergrad-
uate students Topic: Alternative reproductive tactics
in cichlid sh I am looking for 1-2 motivated Interns or
Bachelor students interested in doing a practical project
at the Department of Behavioural Ecology, University of
Bern, Switzerland (minimum 8 weeks, starting Septem-
ber 2015).
We study the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the
origin and maintenance of alternative reproductive tac-
tics (ARTs), with a shell brooding Lake Tanganyika
cichlid as a model system. Lamprologus callipterus ex-
hibits three male ARTs involving an extreme intrasexual
size dimorphism determined by Mendelian inheritance.
Large nest males defend territories and construct nests
of empty snail shells in which females breed. In con-
trast, the genetically xed dwarf males do not court but
enter shells surreptitiously during spawning, in order to
steal fertilizations. Finally, the plastic and conditional
sneaker males enter nests during spawning to steal oc-
casional fertilizations from nest owners. Reproductive
investment and aggression patterns typically diverge
between individuals pursuing ARTs.
We are interested in the following questions: - How do
dierent ARTs perform and adjust to changes in morph
densities? - How do dierent ARTs specialize in spawn-
ing behaviour, ejaculates and sperm? - What is the
inuence of dierent traits on spawning success?
Interns have the chance to choose a topic they would
like to focus on, but may be involved in several projects.
Tasks of the intern/ student: - Participate in the plan-
ning process of your experiment - Help to feed, measure,
weigh and prepare sh for the experiment - Help with
behavioural observations and analysis of the data - Pos-
sibility to help with lab work
The project may be part of your studies. Unfortunately,
the internship/ Bachelor project cannot be paid, but
housing might be available at our institute for some
time.

AarhusU EvolutionRecombination
Evolution and mechanisms of genetic recombination
A post doc position is available to work in the research
group of Kasper Munch at the Bioinformatics Research
Centre at Aarhus University on the evolution and ge-
nomic control of recombination rate. The position is
funded by the Danish National Research Council for
Independent Research.
We recently published a method that infers recombina-
tion maps in ancestral species. This new line of research
oers great promise for a detailed understanding of how
recombination is controlled by the genome and how the
mechanisms of this control evolve. By comparing recom-
bination maps for all living and ancestral species in the
great ape species tree, the candidate will work in close
collaboration with me on research questions such as:
* What is the role of positive selection in the evolution
of recombination landscapes across the species tree?
* Which changes in genomic sequence features trigger
change in ne and broad-scale recombination rate along
branches of the species tree? * What is the isolated
eect of chromosomal rearrangements on recombination
rate in the aected region?
A PhD degree and strong expertise in statistical analy-
sis and population genetics is essential. Analyses will
require programming skills and familiarity with high
performance computing.The position is initially for 1 year with extension for
1 additional year on mutual agreement. The starting
salary depends on qualications but is typically in the
range of EUR 59,000-65,000 per annum, and taxation
is often strongly reduced for applicants, which have not
lived and worked in Denmark for the past 3 years.
The working environment is the Bioinformatics Research
Center (www.birc.au.dk), which has a strong empha-
sis on evolutionary analyses and includes the research
groups of Drs Mikkel. Heide Schierup, Thomas Mailund,
Thomas Bataillon and Asger Hobolth with whom there
are extensive collaborations.
Informal inquiries are encouraged and should be sent to
Kasper Munch at kaspermunch@birc.au.dk. The appli-
cation with CV, list of publications and names of three
referees should also be sent to kaspermunch@birc.au.dk
before Aug 15. Starting date is negotiable, but the
position is available immediately.

Postdoctoral Position - Population genomics
A postdoctoral position is available for up to three years
in the eld of population genomics with the Max Planck
research group \Environmental Genomics" headed by
Prof. Eva H. Stukenbrock. The Max Planck group
is aliated with the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on and the Christian-Albrechts
University of Kiel in the North of Germany. The po-
sition is funded by the German Research Foundation,
DFG, in the framework of the Priority Program \Rapid
Evolutionary Adaptation - Potentials and Constraints".
The project will be conducted in close collaboration
with Prof. Wolfgang Stephan, LMU Munich (soon at
the Museum f ur Naturkunde Berlin), Germany.
Background
Antagonistic co-evolution between pathogens and their
hosts can drive rapid adaptive changes in both partners.
In this project we aim to understand the underlying
mechanisms that drive rapid adaptation in two closely
related fungal plant pathogenic species Zymoseptoria
tritici (pathogen of cultivated wheat) and Z. ardabiliae
(pathogen of wild grasses). These two species dier not
only in terms of host and environment (agro-ecosystem
versus natural grassland) but also in terms of demog-
raphy. Our previous analyses have documented a high
eective population size in Z. tritici and a strong impact
of natural selection on genome evolution.
In this project we aim to investigate the role of recombi-
nation in rapid adaptation of Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae.
Comparing patterns of genome evolution in the two
species that exist in contrasting environments will al-
low us to address the impact of ecological constraints
on evolution of pathogens. We will use a population
genomic approach to infer the genomic recombination
landscape in the two species and identify the presence
of recombination hot spots in coding sequences in both
species. We will detect genes aected by high recombi-
nation rates in hot spots and evaluate the role of high
recombination rates in rapid adaptation. Furthermore,
we aim to identify signatures of positive selection in
the genomes of Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae using com-68 EvolDir August 1, 2015
posite likelihood ratio (CLR) statistics. Hereby we will
infer the genome-wide distribution of selective sweeps
in the two species and we will correlate this information
with recombination maps to assess the importance of
recombination to adaptive evolution.
The development and application of appropriate models
will be conducted with Prof. Wolfgang Stephan. Fur-
thermore, the candidate will collaborate closely with
a molecular biologist in the Environmental Genomics
group that will conduct functional analyses of candidate
\hot spot" and \sweep" genes to be identied in the
genome analyses.

phylogeography, use of phylogenies to study the evolu-
tion of characters.
The second position, associated with the European
VIROGENESIS project (http://www.kuleuven.be/-
english/research/EU/p/horizon2020/sc/sc1/-
Virogenesis), concerns the genomic analysis of virus
sequences. Phylogenetic placement of metagenomic
reads, and bacteriophage evolution by recombination
are among subjects of interest.
The third position is also associated with VIROGE-
NESIS, with focus on molecular epidemiology, virus
evolution, and transmission of resistances. This position
will be supervised by Olivier Gascuel, with possibility
to be hosted at the Institut Pasteur, Paris, in the new

ModelingEvolutionDiseases
Post-doc position in Montpellier on statistical modeling
of ecology and evolution of vector-borne diseases
During the last century, WHO have led public health
interventions that resulted in spectacular achievements
such as the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the
elimination of malaria from the Western World. How-
ever, besides major successes achieved in control of
infectious diseases, most elimination/control programs
remain frustrating in many tropical countries where
specic biological and socio-economical features have
prevented implementation of disease control over broad
spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples in-
clude malaria, dengue, yellow fever, measles and HIV.
There is consequently an urgent need to develop af-
fordable and sustainable disease control strategies that
can target the core of infectious disease transmission in
highly endemic areas.
Focusing on Dengue transmission in Phnom Penh (Cam-
bodia) and on malaria spreading in Bobo-Dioulasso
(Burkina Faso), the PANIC project (PAthogen ^As NIChe:
a new approach for infectious diseases control) aims to
develop conceptual, empirical and theoretical frame-
works to envision optimized public health strategies
for vector-borne diseases by considering the most re-
cent advances in ecology and evolution of infectious dis-
eases. Funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche
(ANR, www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr <http://-
www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr >) for ve years, this
project involves French, Burkinabe and Cambodian re-
searchers from various elds (entomology, virology, epi-
demiology, disease ecology, modeling) to tackle this
issue.
Within this context, we are seeking for a post-doctoral
fellow who will focus on data analyses to quantify the
relative contribution of mosquito, human, pathogen and
environmental factors on the spatio-temporal transmis-
sion dynamics of (i) malaria in Bobo-Dioulasso and (ii)
Dengue viruses in Kampong Cham, Cambodia. Most
of the data relevant to this project (household socio-
economic data, epidemiological time series and mosquito
population dynamics from dierent neighborhoods) are
already available, and additional data will be collected
in the eld at the beginning of the project. The post-doc
will work in close collaboration with two other post-docs,72 EvolDir August 1, 2015
each of these other post-docs will focus on one disease
only and on other facets of disease transmission than
the candidate for this position. Therefore, the post-doc
will play an essential transversal role within the project
and we expect to create a scientic synergy between the
three post-docs.
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in epidemiology, in
ecology and evolution of infectious diseases or in statis-
tics, with evidence of scientic autonomy. A good back-
ground in quantitative epidemiology with cutting-edge
statistical methods (Spatial models, GLMs or Struc-
tural Equations Modeling among other possibilities)
is required. Previous experience in infectious diseases
epidemiology/dynamics in southern countries will be
greatly appreciated. This position is for two years, start-
ing in January 2016, in MIVEGEC lab in Montpellier
(www.mivegec.ird.fr).
Interested candidates should apply by October 1st by
sending (1) a letter of motivation, (2) a CV with pub-
lication list, and (3) the names, institutions and email
addresses of three references to Dr. Benjamin Roche at

Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Phylogeography and Popu-
lation Genetics - Montpellier, France
The application of molecular genetic data in elds such
as population genetics, phylogeography, and evolution-
ary biology have improved abilities to make inferences
regarding evolution of invasiveness. These approaches
stand to aid materially in the development of eective
management strategies such as biological control and
sustainable science-based policies. Continued advance-
ments in the statistical analysis of genetic data promise
to overcome some existing limitations of current ap-
proaches.
Purpose and responsibilities A postdoctoral position is
available at the Centre de Biologie pour la Gestion des
Populations, (CBGP) in partnership with the European
Biological Control Laboratory (EBCL) -USDA-ARS.
Both laboratories are located near Montpellier (France)
at the International Campus of Baillarguet, at Montfer-
rier sur Lez. ^A The successful applicant will be expected
to apply latest models and advances of Phylogeography
and Population Genetics inference to address the evolu-
tionary pattern of an invasive pest and a potentially in-
vasive pest. The applicant will work on two case studies:
the Wheat Stem Sawy (Cephus cinctus), an invasive
insect pest in the U.S. which is presently experiencing
unprecedented outbreaks and the Eurasian cabbage gall
weevil (Ceutorhynchus assimilis syn. C. pleurostigma)
which has some potentially invasive host races. For both
targets, two large data sets of mitochondrial sequences
and microsatellites are already available. The appli-
cant should possess a communication skill set conducive
to assist with management of a large interdisciplinary
project. Experience in writing scientic reports and
manuscripts, excellent communication skills, and ability
to interact productively with a diverse group of col-
laborators is required. ^A Expertise in sequence analysis,
Phylogeography and Population Genetics are skill sets
highly relevant to this position. The successful applicantAugust 1, 2015 EvolDir 73
will manage a large and complex sample database and
will conduct guided but independent analyses leading
to rst author publications. The ideal candidate will
demonstrate initiative, creativity, and will have excel-
lent organizational skills; we also seek candidates with
enthusiasm who work well as part of a team as well as
independently. ^A The position is funded for one year.
Practical information for applications The post-doc po-
sition will be held at CBGP and EBCL labs next to
each other. Applicants are expected to speak and write
English although French is always welcome given the
location of this position. Montpellier hosts one of the

PhylogeographyPopulationGenomics
Post-Doctoral position in phylogeography and popula-
tion genomics Montpellier, France
Purpose and responsibilities:
The research program GENESIS focuses on the role ofGENetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in adapta-
tions to changing Environments: a genomic analySIS
of a biological invasion. It involves four academic re-
search teams from UK and France for the three next
years and is opening a post-doctoral position to work
on the conservation genomics of sh topmouth gudgeon
Pseudorasbora parva, a small cyprinid species native to
East Asia.
The post-doc will be in charge of the analysis of genomic
data (GBS) for conservation genomics (phylogeography)
and estimating heritability of tness related traits using
a molecular based pedigree.
Research program
The main question for the program is to assess the role
of genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in adapt-
ing to changing environmental conditions. GENESIS
uses the framework of biological invasion to answer this
question as the challenge for an invasive species is to re-
spond quickly and eciently to changes in the selective
regime imposed by the colonized ecosystem. In addition,
a series of stochastic sampling events associated with
the colonization process is predicted to result in strong
genetic drift in invasive populations, providing the op-
portunity for rapid evolutionary change through both
selection and drift, and the majority of studies report
marked phenotypic change in invasive populations. The
information on heritability of ecologically signicant
life history traits or behaviors is crucial in accurately
predicting responses to selection and is therefore a key
element of GENESIS that aims at increasing our under-
standing of factors that promote establishment success
of invasive species and the response of small fragmented
populations to climate change.
A phylogeography will be constructed based on the
genomics data. Further, in order to identify genomic re-
gions under selection between populations, an outlier
analysiswill be conducted. The problem of identify-
ing statistically signicant departure from neutrality is
complicated and results related to assumptions made, by
example to the demographic history of the samples. A
variety of tests have been developed either making strict
assumptions about demographic history of the popula-
tions or estimating for evolutionary non independence
among samples. The candidate will have a signicant
experience of such tests including methods based on
summary statistics (eg Fst) as well as bayesian hierar-
chical modelling. The candidate will be able to choose a
justied approach taking into account the characteristic
of the data (SNP and NGS sequencing), the robustness
of the methods to departures from assumptions, and
the consideration of false positive rate.

Sanger UK MosquitoFieldBiologist
This is a rare and exciting opportunity for a Postdoc-
toral Fellow or a Sta Scientist (no PhD required) to
investigate wild African mosquitoes and malaria para-
sites as part of a project on natural genetic variation in
these species of great medical relevance. The eldwork
will take place primarily in Uganda but with oppor-
tunities to expand to other regions of Africa, and we
seek someone with commitment to the project and its
goals including a desire to be based in Uganda (or other
African sites) for long periods of time.
You will take leadership on and be responsible for de-
livering two main facets of our large project on natural
genetic variation. First, we aim to do genetic surveil-
lance to understand population changes of vectors and
parasites over space and time. This will require a dedi-
cated eld biologist who coordinates large-scale collec-
tions of wild parasites and mosquitoes with detailed
record-keeping. Second, we aim to carry out infections
of mosquitoes with malaria parasites in our eld in-
sectary to understand the genetic factors that make
mosquitoes susceptible to parasites. This will require
someone who deeply understands experimental design
and can coordinate the rearing and infections of thou-
sands of mosquitoes while keeping careful records. In
practical terms, the role requires you to be in charge of
delivering high quality, meticulously curated mosquito
and parasite samples back to the Sanger. The resources
you generate will be then be whole genome sequencedresulting in open access genomes on these important
organisms.
The level of your involvement in the analyses of these
data depends on your own interests and whether this is a
postdoctoral or sta scientist role for you. The position
requires someone who has a proven ability to execute
projects and deliver results at a practical level while
working relatively independently. The position will be
tailored to t those with or without PhDs incorporating
further excellent training in population genomics and
vector and parasite biology as desired.
Essential Skills: Field experience, preferably in Africa,
of>1 month at a time working in remote locations
Standard molecular biology wet lab experience (DNA
/RNA extraction, PCR, qPCR)
Experience working with insects and/or parasites, prefer-
ably mosquitoes/malaria
Detail oriented and highly organized
Dedicated eort towards meticulous record-keeping
(thousands of samples will need to be individually pre-
served with recorded phenotypes)
Experience working with international collaborators

StockholmU BehaviourEvolution
Postdoctoral position in Ethology at the Department
of Zoology at Stockholm University. Closing date 1
October 2015.
Project description
A fully funded 2-year post-doctoral position is available
at the Zoology Department (Ethology) at Stockholm
University. The candidate can chose to work within
either or both of two potential projects. For the rst
project, developed in collaboration with Dr Bj orn Rogell
at Stockholm University, we are looking for a person
with demonstrated experience in experiments using sh
as model system. This project involves work on the
eects of lifestyle on life history and behaviour using kil-
lish as a model system. Killish are an excellent model
system because of their strong contrasts in lifestyle:
some species live in temporary water bodies which com-
pletely dry out and only the eggs survive by going into
diapause (annual species), whereas other species live in
permanent water bodies and do not present diapause.
The dierent species thus present marked dierences
in longevity and other life history traits. We currently
have stocks of several annual and non-annual killish
species in the lab allowing the postdoctoral researcher
to develop diverse experiments analyzing the inuence
of lifestyle on life history and behaviour. There is ample
freedom to develop projects which match the chosen
candidate's interests.
The second project involves macro-evolutionary analy-
ses of morphology and behaviour in relation to diver-
sication patterns in the most important Caribbean
amphibian radiation, the family Eleutherodactylus. For
this project the candidate must demonstrate experi-
ence in the use of modern phylogenetic comparative
methods. Potential projects can involve rate of pheno-
typic evolution, analyses of diversication, community
phylogenetics, song evolution, etc.80 EvolDir August 1, 2015
The position will most likely involve research stays at the
Universidad Nacional Aut onoma de M exico, particularly
for candidates working on the second project.
The Department of Zoology was founded in 1880, it is
divided into ve sub-departments: ecology, ethology,
functional morphology, population genetics and system-
atics and evolution and there is much integration and
collaboration among sub-departments. Current research
in the Department of Zoology is focused on animal evolu-
tion, ecology and behaviour, with a broad spectrum from
nervous system to ecosystem involving model organisms
from fruit ies and butteries to shes, birds and large
mammals. The Department oers an international and
stimulating work environment.
Applicants must provide a written report about pre-
vious scientic activity and experience and how they
comply with the requirements of the project applicants
are interested in.
Eligibility and selection criteria
The applicant must have a doctoral degree from an ac-
credited college/university in Biology or a similar eld
of studies. For the postdoctoral position, the PhD de-
gree should have been received no more than three years
before the deadline for applications. Among qualied ap-
plicants selection is made according to scientic merits,
quality of the PhD thesis, the applicant ^As documented
knowledge in subjects of relevance for the research area,
ability to master English language (both spoken and
written), analytical ability, initiative, independence and
ability to cooperate. In lling the position, particular
weight will be given to research prociency, experience
with an experimental approach to tackle evolutionary
questions and experience keeping sh stocks in a labora-
tory environment. The working language in Stockholm
University is English, and even everyday life in Stock-
holm is very simple with English.
Stockholm University strives to be a workplace free from
discrimination and with equal opportunities for all.
Employment conditions.
The position is for two years, full time. The starting date
is negoatiable but preference will be given for candidates
who can begin work in 2015.
Application
Applications must include a CV, list of publications and
a cover letter describing research interests, qualications
and reasons for the application. The letter should also
contain possible starting dates and contact information
of three references.

UAntwerp EvolEcol Rodent Virus
Landscape
POSTDOC POSITION FOR THREE YEARS - The
Evolutionary Ecology Group at University of Antwerp
(www.uantwerpen.be/eveco) has an open position for
a postdoc for three years, in a project \Landscape het-
erogeneity as a driver of evolutionary divergence in two
rodent-borne RNA-viruses: a multi-scale approach."
Evolutionary divergence of directly transmitted virus
lineages is often thought to occur either via codiver-
gence with their hosts or due to the micro-evolutionary
processes related to isolation by distance. Yet, in case
of rapidly evolving RNA viruses with reservoir hosts
that have distinct habitat preferences, landscape hetero-
geneity may be an important factor in virus divergence.
Unpreferred host habitat is, through its eect on host
density, expected to pose a barrier for virus gene ow,
even in the absence of genetic isolation in the host. This
is a consequence of host density thresholds for success-
ful viral transmission. This project aims to investigate
the role of multi-scale landscape patterns in shaping
spatiotemporal patterns of viral divergence in two dis-
tinct rodent-borne RNA viruses: Puumala hantavirus
in bank voles Myodes glareolus in Europe and Mopeia
arenavirus in multimammate mice Mastomys natalen-
sis in Eastern Africa. On a short-term and regional
scale, we will study how local land use patterns aect
viral clustering through space. On a long term and
continental scale we will investigate how virus success
in dierent genetic host groups has led to the types
of particular distribution patterns of these viruses cur-
rently present in these rodents and the extent to which
historic landscape changes has dierentially inuencedhost and virus genetic structures. The project involves
both eldwork and analyses of existing long-term data
and samples.
Applicants should have a strong cv with documented
experience in population genetics, landscape ecology
and/or ecology of viruses and other parasites. Required
skills include molecular lab techniques, sequence anal-
ysis, phylogenetics and phylogeography (preferably of
both viruses and vertebrates). Experience in NGS tech-
niques (especially for whole-genome sequencing of uncul-
tured viruses) and subsequent bioinformatics analyses
would be a bonus.
The successful applicant will take the daily lead of the
project, develop the scientic questions and study de-
sign in collaboration with the project leader and take
responsibilities in supervising M.Sc. and Ph.D. students
working on the project. He/she will be expected to
become involved in the general activities of the research
group, which may also involve a limited amount (max.
30h) of teaching. Under a tax exemption scheme to
attract foreign scientists to Belgium, especially from
outside EU, the funding allows a 3 year full-time post-
doc position. With the available funds, scientists with
current or recent residence in Belgium, and thus without
tax exemption, can only be employed part-time. The

We invite applications for 5 PhD and 4 postdoc positions
within the framework of the new Research Unit
Sociality and the reversal of the fecundity/longevity
trade-o (FOR 2281)
funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG)
Why do organisms age? The genetic underpinnings
of ageing seem to be highly conserved from nematode
worms to humans. Across animals, ageing is charac-
terized by a trade-o between fecundity and longevity,
with an increase in fecundity commonly associated with
accelerated senescence and a drop in lifespan. A ma-
jor exception to this pattern is found within the social
insects. Some social insect queens are record holders
with respect to longevity whereas their sterile workers
are short-lived. The aim of the Research Unit is to
explore, in a highly integrative and interdisciplinary
fashion, the ultimate and proximate reasons for the
apparent reversal in the fecundity/longevity trade-o
associated with sociality by using all major clades of
social insects, with Drosophila melanogaster as model
non-social organism. Projects will apply a broad range
of approaches from experimental manipulation, eld-
based studies and molecular genetic studies (e.g. qRT
PCR, NGS) to theoretical evolutionary modelling and
bioinformatics analysis.
PhD positions will be available on the following topics:
- The physiological and metabolic basis of the
fecundity/longevity trade-o in Drosophila (Prof.
Dr. Thomas Flatt, University of Lausanne;
thomas.att@unil.ch)
- The fecundity/longevity trade-o in an orchid bee at
the cusp of sociality (Prof. Dr. Robert Paxton, Univer-

- The genomic tool box to transform a short-lived social
bee into a long-lived parasite (Prof. Dr. Robin Moritz,

- Fecundity/longevity reversal in a social insect with
alternative reproductive strategies (Prof. Dr. Susanne

The successful candidate will integrate mechanisms into

volves an international collaboration between Redouan
Bshary (host at Neuch ~Atel), John McNamara (Bristol)
and Olof Leimar (Stockholm) for the mathematical as-
pects, and Arnon Lotem (Tel Aviv) for the mechanistic
aspects of learning. It is expected that the post doc will
visit these colleagues for direct discussions.90 EvolDir August 1, 2015
The study is integrated into a grant provided by the
Swiss Science Foundation with the title \How proximate
factors underlying decision making may aect the evo-
lution of cooperation" (grant holder: Redouan Bshary).
Large parts of this project are empirical in nature, with
marine cleaning mutualism as a model system. Cleaner
sh remove ectoparasites from other ^ aclient' reef sh,
but a conict of interest exists as the cleaners prefer to
eat client mucus. This conict apparently promoted the
evolution of sophisticated decision rules in cleaners, en-
abling them to adjust service quality to various factors
like client strategic options, the presence of bystanders,
the co-inspection by the partner, level of satiation, etc.
While studying more and more both cognition and phys-
iology underlying variation in cooperation, we recently
found that individual cleaners from rather marginal
habitats employ simple rules-of-thumb rather than pre-
cise decision rules. These data should be seen as an
inspiration for the modelling part. We aim to develop
models that explicitly link parameters aecting social
complexity with costs and benets of more or less so-
phisticated decision rules, i.e. rules that use dierent
amounts of information about the social environment.
Our variables of interest will aect the eciency of dif-
ferent updating rules that would lead to more or less
knowledgeable / cognitively enabled individuals. The
updating rules should take into account likely learning
mechanisms used by animals, like reinforcement learn-
ing. We will explore the eects of social complexity and
learning on both ecological and evolutionary time scales.
The powerful combination of modelling and empirical
data, especially the explicit links between mechanisms
and function, should provide us with novel insights con-
cerning the conditions promoting stable cooperation.^ a
The successful candidate should have a PhD, proven
evidence of modelling skills in the form of peer reviewed
publications, and a strong motivation to make a career
in research. In addition, the social competence of the
successful candidate will be a key priority. The be-
havioural ecology group at Neuch ~Atel comprises 3 post
docs, 6 PhD students and various Master students. We
have strong links with other research groups within the
university and within Switzerland (never more than 2h
away). For more information, please check our website
http://www2.unine.ch/ethol/page-5880 fr.html or send
an email to redouan.bshary@unine.ch. The position

Glasgow AppliedBayesianModelling
Oct26-31
Statistics course - Applied Bayesian modelling for ecolo-
gists and epidemiologists
This course is being delivered by Dr. Matt Derwood
and Prof. Jason Matthiopouus.
This extensive 6 day course will be held at SCENE (Scot-
tish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment),
Glasgow, United Kingdom from 26th - 31dt October
2015.
Course Aims: This application-driven course will pro-
vide a founding in the basic theory and practice of
Bayesian statistics, with a focus on MCMC modeling for
ecological and epidemiological problems. Starting from
a refresher on probability and likelihood, the course willtake students all the way to cutting-edge applications
such as state-space population modeling and spatial
point-process modeling. Most importantly you should
have a keen interest in ecology or epidemiology (or both)
and come prepared to discuss your own research prob-
lems with the instructors.
Overview This course provides a general introduction
to Bayesian statistics, including theory and practical
implementation of MCMC methods. By the end of the
week, you should be able to understand the key practi-
cal and philosophical dierences between Bayesian and
Frequentist statistics, have a basic understanding of how
common MCMC samplers work and how to program
them, and have practical experience with the BUGS
language for common ecological and epidemiological
models. The experience gained will be a sucient foun-
dation enabling you to understand current papers using
Bayesian methods, carry out simple Bayesian analyses
on your own data and springboard into more elaborate
applications such as dynamical, spatial and hierarchical
modeling. The main focus of the week is on practical
application of these methods, so a large proportion of
the time will be spent doing exercises in R. The underly-
ing statistical theory and an overview of more advanced
concepts will be discussed where appropriate.
Intended Learning Outcomes By the end of this course
you will be able to: 1. Do calculations with conditional,
joint and total probability. 2. Understand the key philo-
sophical dierences between Bayesian and Frequentist
statistics and be in a position to decide which approach
is likely to be most useful for particular research ques-
tions. 3. Use prior information along with likelihood
information to form a Bayesian posterior in simple ex-
amples 4. The concept of Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) and how this is used in practice 5. Critically
discuss the role of autocorrelation and cross- correlation
in model identiability and Monte Carlo error 6. Write
regression models (GLMs, GLMMs) in WinBUGS /
JAGS and t these to data 7. Use biological rst princi-
ple or independent information to choose and implement
both informative and minimally informative priors 8.
Identify when a model has converged and when sucient
Monte Carlo samples have been obtained 9. Conduct
model selection and comparisons using DIC. Understand
the motivation and advantages of alternative model se-
lection methods. 10. Understand and customize more
complex models for ecological populations in space and
time Outline
Each day will consist of both taught material with dis-
cussion, and guided computer practical sessions with
assistance on hand. These will be interspersed evenly to
ensure that all of the concepts discussed are reinforced
with practical exercises. The planned content for eachAugust 1, 2015 EvolDir 97
day is as follows:
Day 1 Revision of likelihoods, using full likelihood pro-
les, and introduction to the theory of Bayesian statis-
tics.
Probability and likelihood Introduction to Bayesian
statistics
Day 2 An introduction to the workings of MCMC, and
the potential dangers of MCMC inference. Participants
will program their own (basic) MCMC sampler to illus-
trate the concepts and fully understand the strengths
and weaknesses of the general approach. The day will
end with an introduction to the BUGS language.
Introduction to MCMC Markov chains, autocorrelation
and convergence Introduction to BUGS and running
simple models in JAGS
Day 3 This day will focus on the common models for
which JAGS/BUGS would be used in practice, with
examples given for dierent types of model code. All
aspects of writing, running, assessing and interpreting
these models will be extensively discussed so that par-
ticipants are able and condent to run similar models
on their own. There will be a particularly heavy focus
on practical sessions during this day. The day will nish
with a discussion of how to assess the t of MCMC
models using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)
and other methods.
Using JAGS for common problems in biology Essential
tting tips and model selection
Day 4 The fourth day will focus on the exibility of
MCMC, and precautions required for using MCMC to
model commonly encountered datasets.

Nov2-13
This November we hold our biannual PhD course on the
Ecology of Animal Migration. PhD students working on
animal migration and related animal movement topics
are encouraged to apply.Ecology of Animal Migration
International PhD Course, November 2nd - 13th, 2015
Lund University, Sweden.
Animals move across dierent spatial and temporal
scales either as part of their daily life or as part of
seasonal migrations to exploit resources in the environ-
ment. Well known examples are the global scale seasonal
migrations in birds, sea turtles, sh and mammals, such
as whales and wildebeests. Also movements at smaller
scales occur, such as the vertical movements in plank-
ton, the dispersal in soil collembolans and movements of
pollinating insects. But what are the ecological causes
and evolutionary consequences of animal movements?
During this two-week course you will get insight in a
number of dierent methods and approaches to study
the migration of birds, insects, sh, amphibians and
mammals, ranging from experimental studies in the
laboratory to tracking long-distance migration in wild
animals. Lectures will be given by international authori-
ties in the eld as well as by researchers in the CAnMove
Group at Lund University.

Manchester Morphometrics
Nov2-Dec11
Dear colleagues
I am pleased to announce this year's morphometrics
course from the University of Manchester. This year's
course will run in the six weeks from 2 November to 11
December 2015.
The course information can be found on the following
we site: http://www.ywings.org.uk/MorphoCourse
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Denitions
of size and shape * Geometric methods to characterise
shape from a conguration of landmark points (Pro-
crustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation, scatter
plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal component
analysis * Measurement error and outliers * Shape trans-
formations and 'warping' { the thin plate spline * Anal-
ysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing between groupsAugust 1, 2015 EvolDir 99
(taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) * Allometry and
size correction * Inuence of external factors on shape
(ecomorphology, dose-response studies) * Symmetric
forms and measurement of asymmetry. * Morphometric
inferences on developmental processes * Morphological
integration and modularity * Genetics of shape: analy-
ses of resemblance between relatives, QTL analyses. *
Phylogeny: reconstructing the evolution of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.
The fee for the course is GBP 330.00.
All prospective participants need to pre-register for the
course. The deadline for this is the *30 September
2015*.

Manchester Morphometrics
Nov2-Dec11 Changes
Dear colleagues
After some discussion with our administrators, we de-
cided to change the registration procedure for this year's
online course on morphometrics. The new procedureis simpler, because there is only a single step for reg-
istration and payment. This also enables us to have a
deadline that is quite a bit later than it was under the
old procedure.
The new registration procedure uses the university's e-
store, which can process automatic *payments by credit
card or debit card*. The deadline for registration via
this site is the *23 October 2015*.
If you cannot pay by credit or debit card, or *if you
require a formal invoice* (e.g. for reimbursement
by your institution), you need to contact the Short
Course Oce in our faculty via this E-mail: FLS-
shortcourses@manchester.ac.uk If you need to use this
option, please do so as soon as possible, but denitely
*well before October*.
Further information on the course and a link to the
registration page can be found on the following we site:

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the102 EvolDir August 1, 2015
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
