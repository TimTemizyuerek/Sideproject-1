Dear All Apologies for cross-posting, but we would like
to re-announce that we are proud to be hosting the
Third Annual Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Dis-
eases Conference, in conjunction with a modeling work-
shop, to be held in May 2005 at Colorado State Uni-versity. The program is still under development, but a
web page with further information can viewed at:
http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/EEID2005/ The
conference and workshop have funding from the Na-
tional Science Foundation, so we will be accepting ap-
plications from post-docs and graduate students, both
from the United States and internationally, for support
of travel to Fort Collins. Application deadlines will be
in early March, 2005, with decisions made shortly after.
Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Princi-
pal Organizer: Michael Antolin, Department of Biology
and Program for Interdisciplinary Math, Ecology and
Statistics (PRIMES), Colorado State University, Fort
Collins, CO 80524 Workshop: May 14-18, 2005 Appli-
cation of disease models to long-term population data
Conference: May 19-21 Ecology and Evolution of Infec-
tious Diseases: 3rd Annual Conference Organizing com-
mittee: Mike Antolin, Colorado State University Ottar
Bjornstad, Pennsylvania State University Andrew Dob-
son, Princeton University Karen Garrett, Kansas State
University Peter Hudson, Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity Mary Poss, University of Montana Les Real, Emery
University David Smith, National Institutes of Health
Workshop focus: Advances in numerical and statistical
models in infectious diseases have provided the oppor-
tunity for exploring how long-term population moni-
toring data can be analyzed in the context of disease
dynamics. We will run a workshop in which graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers will learn the
major skills for analysis and modeling and then apply
these to speciﬁc data sets. The workshop will be fo-April 1, 2005 EvolDir 3
cused around two questions: 1) is it possible to test
with models whether compensatory mortality caused
by a previously undetected disease has inﬂuenced dy-
namics of a host population? 2) given a long-term pop-
ulation data set, which may or may not include disease
prevalence, what observations or experiments would be
needed to test hypotheses regarding infectious disease?
We will recruit participants for this workshop by solicit-
ing for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers
who have access to long-term data sets they could bring
with them to the workshop. The aim is to explore the
data sets using a wide arsenal of analytical and sta-
tistical techniques. We plan to follow the model that
has been developed in the PRIMES program at Col-
orado State University, where teams of graduate stu-
dents with backgrounds and interest in ecology, mathe-
matics, and/or statistics are grouped to solve analytical
and biological challenges that arise. Thus, we hope to
recruit graduate students and post-docs from statistics
and applied mathematics to participate in the work-
shop, and certainly to attend the conference that fol-
lows. These students may not have access to long-term
data sets, but would provide us with an opportunity to
recruit applied mathematicians and statisticians into
infectious disease research. We will use the experiences
of the math and stats faculty in PRIMES at Colorado
State to help in this recruiting eﬀort. We hope to have
20 or more workshop participants, in addition to the
researchers who will provide modeling and statistical
expertise to the workshop participants. We expect that
ﬁve additional participants will be graduate students or
post-docs who are currently in the PRIMES program
in Fort Collins. The researcher/faculty are: Mike An-
tolin, Ottar Bjornstad, Andy Dobson, Karen Garrett,
Peter Hudson, Mary Poss, Les Real, David Smith.
Conference focus: This will be the third Ecology and
Evolution of Infectious Disease conference and follows
two previously successful meetings at Penn State and
Emory. The conference will follow the workshop and
build on the experience learnt from previous meetings.
Essentially this will be a two day science meeting, aimed
speciﬁcally at graduate students but limited in size to
approximately 75 participants. The plan is to have
talks presented mostly by graduate and post doctoral
workers with a short but broad introduction from PIs.
The conference will be organized around the following
two areas, with two sub-areas subsumed under the ﬁrst
of them: 1.) Disease persistence and transmission: How
do pathogens persist? i) the role of super-spreaders ii.)
metapopulation dynamics 2.) Immune system dynam-
ics: do they scale from the individual to the population
level? i.) can within-host immune processes explain in-
cidence, severity, and virulence? We plan to have eacharea represented by more established researchers who
can address theoretical, clinical, or empirical aspects of
each area. Thus, we

Undergrads
DIVERSITY AT SSE/SSB 2005:
Call for applications for undergraduates of diverse back-
grounds to attend the 2004 meeting of the Society for
the Study of Evolution/Society of Systematic Biologists
*** and ***
Call for volunteer mentors for this program from grad-
uate students, postdocs and faculty.
In 2001, 14 undergraduates of diverse backgrounds re-
ceived funding from a pilot NSF- Undergraduate Men-
toring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) grant to at-
tend the annual meetings of SSE/SSB in Knoxville,
Tennessee, present posters, and interact with graduate
student, postdoc and faculty mentors. The program
has since supported undergraduates attending the 2003
meeting in Chico, California and the 2004 meeting in
Fort Collins, Colorado.
The program will take place again at the 2005 meeting
this June in Fairbanks, Alaska and we are now accept-
ing applications. The application deadline is April 1,
2005. Applications will consist of a title, author line
and abstract of the poster to be presented by the un-
dergraduate; a one or two paragraph (no more than 1
page) statement of academic interests and career goals
and of how attending the Evolution meetings will helpApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 5
meet these goals; and one letter of recommendation
from the undergraduate’s research advisor. All ma-
terials should be submitted as pdf ﬁles and emailed
to Rich Kliman at rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu. Appli-
cations will be accepted only from students registered
or very recently graduated from U.S. institutions, in-
cluding Puerto Rico (i.e., having ﬁnished classes during
the winter or spring semesters before the meeting) and
traveling to the meeting from within the US. Students
demonstrating a need for funds to attend SSE/SSB will
be given preference, and will be selected so that as a
group, they will increase cultural diversity among un-
dergraduates at Evolution meetings.
In addition to applications from undergradu-
ates, we hope to receive email notices to rmkli-
man@cedarcrest.edu from graduate students, postdocs
and faculty who wish to serve as undergraduate men-
tors for the meetings. Duties will include meeting with
a pair of undergraduates in the program, attending
and demystifying a half-day of talks with them, joining
them for a meal, introducing them to colleagues
and in general befriending them in ways that make
evolutionary biology seem like a welcoming discipline.
No costs for travel, housing or registration are covered.
Please spread the word about this very rewarding
activity.

SELECTION CRITERIA for participating undergrad-
uates:
Students will be selected so that:
a) As a group, attending students must increase cul-
tural diversity among undergraduates at Evolution
meetings.
b) Students and faculty demonstrating a need for stu-
dent funds to attend SSE will be given preference.
Those students without access to travel funds from their
institutions or their research advisor’s research budget
will be chosen over those that have signiﬁcant support.
c) Students must be registered undergraduates or very
recent graduates (i.e., having ﬁnished classes during the
winter or spring quarters (semesters) before the meet-
ing).
d) All students will be encouraged to attend the entire
meeting to maximize their participation and to mini-mize travel costs by spanning a Saturday overnight stay.
Thus travel schedule will be for arrival on 9 June 2005
and departure on 15 June. Students selected for the
award will make travel arrangements through a desig-
nated travel agent working with this program.

goal of this symposium is to bring together statisticians,
data analysts, bio-information scientists and computa-
tional biologists from universities, research institutes
and industry and to bring them in contact with the
newest developments in statistical genetics. Leadingexperts in this ﬁeld will discuss diﬀerent themes, in-
cluding pharmacogenetics, genetic association analysis,
marker-assisted plant breeding and micro-array analy-
sis.

Abstract: Evolutionary theory has reﬁned greatly in
recent years, particularly regarding the role of ecol-
ogy. Concurrently, new methods and empirical sys-April 1, 2005 EvolDir 7
tems allow testing this theory, the recent application
of non-invasive molecular techniques to ﬁeld and lab
populations being especially instrumental. This sym-
posium covers recent empirical studies in life history
evolution and adaptive diversiﬁcation using very dif-
ferent systems and methods: from microbes to verte-
brates, from “evolution in a bottle” to populations with
extended pedigrees, from natural to anthropogenic se-
lection. Bringing biologists from these diverse ﬁelds
together will stimulate testing evolutionary theory in
exciting new ways.

GenomicsSymposium Aug15-20
Genomic approaches towards tracing adaptive evolu-
tion - a special symposium in ESEB 2005
Organizers: D. Tautz (Germany) & C. Schl¨ otterer
(Austria)
The identiﬁcation of genes subjected to natural selec-
tion has been one of the primary research interests inpopulation genetics over the past decades. With the
recent technological advancements and the availability
of numerous fully sequenced genomes, the emphasis is
shifting from the analysis of single candidate genes to-
wards analyses on the genomic scale. This new ap-
proach oﬀers the potential of identifying genes sub-
jected to selection without the need of a priori infor-
mation about putative candidate genes.
This symposium will be held in the ESEB 2005 meet-
ing in Krakow 15-20.8.2005, and it is sponsored by Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB). Se-
lected contributions from this symposium will be pub-
lished in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology which
has recently expanded its editorial board and wel-
comes more contributions from the ﬁeld of molec-
ular evolution ( http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/-

rays for mapping and expression analysis: Toward the
genetic determinants of light response adaptation in

MeasuringNatalDispersal Aug19-23
Hi all
I would like to bring the following workshop to your
attention:
Title: Measuring natal dispersal: current approaches
and future challenges Location: Strasbourg, France
Conference: 6th meeting of the European Ornitholo-
gists’ Union Date: 19 - 23 August 2005 Abstract: Na-
tal dispersal, the movement of an individual from its
birthplace to the site of ﬁrst reproduction, is a key pro-
cess with many causes and consequences for individuals,
populations and communities. Despite its importance,
our knowledge of dispersal is at best limited for most
species. Obtaining reliable estimates of dispersal rates,
distances and timing is notoriously diﬃcult, mainly be-
cause of great logistic challenges. These include lim-
itations of surveys to a few study plots mainly due
to time and money constraints, diﬃculties in record-
ing long-distance dispersal, and incomplete correlation
between movements of individuals and gene ﬂow among
subpopulations. The aims of this workshop are to get
an overview of currently used methods and techniques
and to discuss the potential of new approaches in the
study of natal dispersal. Researchers are encouraged
to present their (new) methods for studying natal dis-
persal. We aim at bringing together as wide a range
of topics as possible, including for example studies us-
ing genetic methods, radio-tracking or observational ap-
proaches as well as probabilistic techniques. We also
hope that this workshop will increase the interest in
and will stimulate new research programs on natal dis-
persal.

Final announcement: One-day Structure@Sea Sympo-sium Thursday, 14th of April 2005, University of Ams-
terdam, The Netherlands. http://staﬀ.science.uva.nl/-
˜peijnenb Marine-dwelling organisms are usually imag-
ined to be part of huge populations, characterized by
almost unlimited interchange. This is especially true
for free-living critters in the plankton that may travel
wherever the water current takes them. Allopatric di-
vergence and speciation are therefore not expected to
play a major role at the spatial scales at which they
typically act in other habitats. Nonetheless, species di-
versity and levels of population genetic structuring are
often unexpectedly high. This symposium reviews the
observed patterns for pelagic as well as benthic organ-
isms and discusses recent theories on the possible causes
for these.
The symposium is organized on the occasion of the PhD
defense of Katja Peijnenburg and will consist of presen-
tations by a diverse group of internationally renowned
as well as up-and-coming scientists, and will include a
poster session.
The event is free of charge and open to all. However,
we do ask for you to register by sending an email to
Pieternella Luttikhuizen (luttikhuizen@science.uva.nl).
Participants are encouraged to bring posters.
Conﬁrmed speakers are: Nancy Knowlton (University
of California, USA) Colomban de Vargas (Rutgers Uni-
versity, New Brunswick, USA) Matthew Hare (Univer-
sity of Maryland, USA) Jeanine Olsen (University of

First Announcement on EVOLDIR
International Symposium Mediterranean plant conser-
vation in a changing world
29 September - 2 October 2005 Hyeres Var, France
Organizers :
Institut M´ editerran´ een dEcologie et de Pal´ eo´ ecologie
(IMEP, UMR CNRS 6116), Universit´ e Paul C´ ezanne
(Aix-Marseille III). & Conservatoire Botanique Na-
tional M´ editerran´ een de Porquerolles
Abstract :
The Mediterranean Basin represents one of the 34
“hotspots” of biodiversity, primarily because of its rich-
ness in plant species and the high rates of endemism
it contains. However this region has been subject to
long term and intense human impacts, and may be
severely aﬀected by future modiﬁcations to the envi-
ronment associated with global change. The conser-
vation of Mediterranean plant diversity in this chang-
ing world thus constitutes a key issue for conservationbiologists and landscape managers. The main objec-
tive of this symposium is to evaluate eﬀective conser-
vation solutions to the apparent dilemma of conserving
plant diversity in a region where it is likely to become
both more vulnerable and more variable in space and
time. Twenty years after the seminal synthesis edited
by C. G´ omez-Campo in 1985 (Plant conservation in the
Mediterranean area), and on the 25th anniversary of
the Conservatoire Botanique National M´ editerran´ een
de Porquerolles, this conference will provide a new as-
sessment of the plant conservation status of the circum-
Mediterranean ﬂora. The focus of the conference will
be on recent progress, with the additional aim of bring-
ing to light gaps in our knowledge worthy of future
attention. The emergence, and rapid development, of
several new disciplines (e.g. conservation genetics, phy-
logeography, landscape ecology, and ecological model-
ing) have lead to several conceptual and practical ad-
vances whose integration provides a standpoint from
which to assess the conservation of plant biodiversity
in the Mediterranean Region. The presentation of syn-
thetic overviews, accompanied by the results of more
focused innovative projects in this conference will con-
tribute to the development of new perspectives for a
dynamic approach to the conservation of the Mediter-
ranean ﬂora within the framework of the Global Strat-
egy for Plant Conservation.
Program
29th September : - Session 1 Evaluation of conservation
strategies in diﬀerent regions around of the Mediter-
ranean basin The purpose of this session is to assess
the current state of our knowledge concerning (i) the
rare and threatened species of the Mediterranean ﬂora
(existence of red lists, data bases and catalogues of
protected plants), (ii) protected areas (status and pur-
poses) and (iii) conservation actions that have begun
in diﬀerent regions of the Mediterranean Basin. Talks
will be selected to cover the diﬀerent biogeographical
regions of the Mediterranean Basin (northern shores
of the western Mediterranean, north-east Africa, the
Balkans, Turkey and the Middle-East)
- Session 2 Major threats and their consequences for
the Mediterranean ﬂora This session will examine the
major causes of rarefaction and threats of extinction
in the Mediterranean ﬂora. The diﬀerent elements of
global change (landuse change and habitat fragmenta-
tion, climate change and invasive species) will be ex-
amined. A priority will be given to the eﬀects of these
environmental changes on the distribution and popula-
tion dynamics of narrow endemic, rare and protected
species.
30th September : - Session 3 New advances in the bi-12 EvolDir April 1, 2005
ological and ecological plant conservation This full-day
session will be centred on recent conceptual progress in
plant conservation and its application to the Mediter-
ranean ﬂora. Two half-day sessions are programmed.
In the ﬁrst, the use of phylogeographic and genetic data
for the identiﬁcation of evolutionary signiﬁcant units for
the conservation of geographically peripheral, ecologi-
cally marginal or fragmented populations The poten-
tial role of a metapopulation approach will be consid-
ered here. In the second part of this session, studies of
the ecological processes associated with species interac-
tions, demography and ecogeograpical plant diﬀerentia-
tion will be covered in order to illustrate the importance
of a spatially oriented approach to conservation ecology.
1rst October : - Session 4 Experimental programmes of
conservation and restoration The ﬁnal session will pro-
vide a more practical viewpoint on conservation issues
for Mediterranean plants. In this session cases studies
of conservation and restoration will be presented with
the aim being to cover a variety of situations and prob-
lems in the Mediterranean region This will allow for the
emergence of practical guidelines for future projects of
habitat and species conservation.
2nd October : Field excursion.

Sea(Ifremer) and the Centre for Ecological and Evolu-
tionary Synthesis (CEES) proposes a doctoral schol-
arship to University candidates or engineers with a
Master degree or equivalent. The scholarships are at-
tributable for a period of 3 years, out of which approx-
imately 18 months are to be spent at each of the two
institutions. This research position is oﬀered within one
of the 29 themes proposed by Ifremer (see below) and
is titled “Eﬀects of the color of environmental noise on
the persistence of marine exploited populations: a com-
parative approach among various ecosystems” (num-
ber 14). The procedure for application and a brief de-
scription of the thesis project is given below. For fur-
ther information, please contact Nils Chr. STENSETH
(n.c.stenseth@bio.uio.no or Jean-Marc FROMENTIN
(Jean.Marc.Fromentin@ifremer.fr).
These scholarships are attributable for a period of max-imum 3 years following a yearly evaluation of the re-
sults. They are obtainable by students who prepare
their thesis in one of Ifermer’s laboratories or in one
of the laboratories of the collaborative Universities of
Ifremer.
The proposed research subjects should correspond to
one of the themes that are prioritized by the establish-
ment and contribute to this research. The subjects and
their corresponding scientiﬁc goals are indicated in the
table that can be found at
www.ifremer.fr/francais/actual/bourses/aﬃche-
bourses-2005.pdf . The scholarship, who corresponds
to a monthly payment of 1380 ??? (1820 USD brut -
18 months spent at S` ete, France) and from 2930 ???
(3860 USD - 18 months spent in Oslo, Norway) (not
cumulative with other scholarships), are obtainable
after an evaluation of the application from the Com-
mission of scholarships at Ifermer. It is planned that
12 subjects for co-ﬁnanced thesis and that the subjects
in totality will be ﬁnanced at Ifremer. The partners of

P.O. box 1050, Blindern, 0316 Oslo, Norway. See web
page: http://www.cees.no/ Duration: 3 years
Objectives and Originality:
The objectives of the study are to: (i) determine
the properties of the marine physical environments
of several exploited populations, using environmental
databases such as COADS and (ii) model the variability
in abundance of marine populations and evaluate the
importance of environmental impacts. The approach
will be data-oriented and will be mainly based on time
series analyses.
The originality of this work will be related to the sys-
tematic description of the environmental stochasticity
of diﬀerent ecosystems (e.g., continental shelves ver-
sus open ocean) of various oceans (cold to temperate
or tropical seas). The originality will also be within
its extensive comparative approach, i.e., among various
environments and species of various trophic levels (i.e.,
top predator versus small pelagic). The purpose of such
extensive comparison work would be to answer to the
following key questions:
??? Do all marine environments exhibit similar red-
dened noise (in reference to Vasseur & Yodzis 2004)?
??? Can we characterise similarities/diﬀerences among
key marine systems? ??? What are the diﬀerent ef-
fects of diverse environmental noises on exploited ma-
rine populations? ??? Do all the populations transform
or integrate similarly the signature of environmental
and climate noise? ??? What is the importance of life
history traits, trophic level, and area in the response of
the populations? ??? How can ﬁsheries impact on pop-
ulation modify population responses to environmental
noise?
Such a topic is very broad and needs to be restricted to
a given set

birds Supervisors: Dr Peter Bennett (Institute of Zo-
ology, principal supervisor), Dr John Ewen (Institute

partment of Biology, Imperial, University supervisor).
Project aims: Does sexual selection drive extinction?
If so, how does it operate? Does the evolution of ex-
travagant or exaggerated traits heighten extinction risk
due to the costs of producing and maintaining them,
or does sexual selection result in another form of spe-
cialisation, dooming species to extinction in the face
of rapid anthropogenic change? These questions are
highly controversial, with some current theory and ev-
idence providing support for the role of sexual selec-
tion in extinction, while other studies reject the argu-
ment. Much of this confusion arises because diﬀerent
studies use diﬀerent indices of the intensity of sexual
selection, and diﬀerent phylogenetic, ecological and ge-
ographical scales of analysis. This study will attempt
to resolve this confusion by performing a series of new
tests of how sexual selection might inﬂuence extinction
risk in birds. Speciﬁcally by - i) examining variationApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 15

visors: Dr Andrew Bourke (Institute of Zoology, prin-
cipal supervisor), Dr Seirian Sumner (Institute of Zo-
ology, second supervisor), Dr William Foster (Depart-
ment of Zoology, University of Cambridge, University
supervisor). Project aims and methods: Kin selection
theory predicts favourable treatment of relatives (kin
discrimination) in social groups, but whether this oc-
curs is controversial. In social insects, early studies
failed to ﬁnd unequivocal within-colony kin discrimi-
nation [e.g. 1], but more recent work suggests that it
exists [2]. However, no study has demonstrated clear
within-colony kin discrimination in favour of sexuals
(queens and males), which is the critical prediction.
Conﬁrming or refuting this prediction would therefore
represent a major advance in our understanding of a
fundamental evolutionary theory. Using the multiple-
queen (polygynous) ant Leptothorax acervorum as a
model system, this studentship will test the hypothe-
sis of within-colony kin discrimination favouring related
sexuals.
L. acervorum represents an excellent system for this
work because it is common, easily collected in the ﬁeld,
and readily kept and observed in captivity. In addi-
tion, previous work led by the principal supervisor has
established seven polymorphic microsatellite loci for L.
acervorum and provided extensive knowledge of colony
kin structure and demography, as well as queen and
worker behaviour [e.g. 3-8]. We therefore know that re-
lated queens in polygynous colonies share reproduction,
with the result that workers tend adult queens and sex-
ual larvae of diﬀering relatedness to themselves. This
provides a natural context for the evolution of within-
colony kin discrimination. The student will perform a
series of laboratory experiments involving behavioural
observations, controlled manipulations and microsatel-
lite genotyping to test the hypothesis of within-colony
kin discrimination.
The student will receive training in evolutionary biol-

Oxford University: Protozoan Molecular Evolution 3

ology Starting 1 October 2005. Open to UK citizens
and to EU residents. Please apply very soon.
THE PROJECT: Evolution, gene discovery, and lat-
eral gene transfer in the ecologically most important
soil Protozoa: Cercozoa
A major advance in understanding eukaryote evolu-
tion during the past 3 years has been the recognition
that protozoa belonging to the phylum Cercozoa (estab-
lished only in 1998 by Cavalier-Smith), together with
Foraminifera and Radiolaria, constitute Rhizaria, one
of ﬁve major supergroups forming the eukaryote evo-
lutionary tree. Understanding the evolution, physiol-
ogy, and ecology of this major branch of the tree of
life is severely limited by the complete absence of any
genome project for it. To help ﬁll this major gap the
student would sequence thousands of genes from C-
DNA libraries of about ﬁve phylogenetically ill-resolved
and ecologically diverse cercozoan classes, and analyse
them bioinformatically and phylogenetically. Cercozoa,
as the only culturable rhizarians, are the best rhizarian
targets for gene discovery by large-scale cDNA sequenc-
ing.
BACKGROUND Thirteen protozoan phyla with very
distinctive body plans are now recognised, but only
three or four play really major roles in all habitats
(Amoebozoa, Ciliophora, Cercozoa, and to a lesser ex-
tent Euglenozoa). Recent work using environmental
rRNA library screening and intensive culturing of the
latter two phyla in my laboratory has shown that Cer-
cozoa comprise thousands of species, many belonging
to previously undetected major clades. Cercozoa now
has 10 classes, representing huge morphological diver-
sity, including testate, ﬁlose, and reticulate amoebae,
ﬂagellates, algae, and organisms previously classiﬁed
as heliozoa, radiolaria, and even fungi. High levels of
cercozoan diversity have been found in most environ-
ments sampled; some appear to be restricted to marine
environments, others to non-marine, while some strains
appear to ﬂourish in both. In many microbial commu-
nities Cercozoa appear to be among the most abundant
predators. They commonly eat bacteria and unicellu-
lar fungi, but are also known to digest larger organ-isms, and the phylum includes at least two parasitic
classes. Some unicellular strains can form large, retic-
ulose, multinucleate plasmodia, the function of which
is unclear. It is thus probably the most diverse but
least studied of all protozoan phyla and thus the scope
for exciting novel discoveries is immense. There is al-
ready an extensive EST project under way in a Cana-
dian Laboratory for Bigelowiella, the best-studied rep-
resentative of the only photosynthetic (exclusively ma-
rine) class (Chlorarachnea) in the phylum, which re-
tained the plastid and miniaturised nucleus of an en-
gulfed green alga. Our new project would be the ﬁrst
major and broad molecular study of any heterotrophic
rhizarians. Our lab provides an excellent environment
for this research as there would be a second student and
a postdoctoral researcher (David Bass) also working on
Cercozoan evolution and ecology, with much opportu-
nity for exchange of ideas and mutual help.
AIMS 1. To quantitate gene transfer from food bacteria
into cercozoan genomes (about 1% in Amoebozoa).
2. Discover genes associated with diﬀerent aspects of
the diverse lifestyles exhibited by Cercozoa.
3. Determine whether these heterotrophs have any
genes supporting the theory of a photosynthetic ances-
try of all Cercozoa.
4. Construct multigene trees to settle the evolutionary
relationship of the major classes of Cercozoa and to test
the theory that Rhizaria are sisters of excavates.
5. To follow up one or more of the likely unexpected dis-
coveries of the sequencing projects in accordance with
the student’s developing interests and preferences using
whatever methods are most appropriate.

THE PROJECT: Biodiversity, population structure,
and ecology of sarcomonad Cercozoa (Protozoa) This
project is on the environmental adaptiveness of diﬀer-
ent genotypes of soil protozoa and the related question
whether they are mostly sexual or mostly asexual. Cer-
cozoa, established only in 1998 by Cavalier-Smith, is
quantitatively the most abundant phylum of soil proto-
zoa, as they include ﬁlose testate amoebae, numerous
groups of zooﬂagellates (phagotrophic heterotrophic
ﬂagellates) naked reticulose amoebae and many organ-
isms that are both ﬂagellate and amoeboid (e.g. sar-
comonads); the latter two body types especially seem to
be particularly characteristic of and adaptively suited
to living in soil and sediments. This project will focus
on sarcomonad zooﬂagellates (heteromitids and Cer-
comonas), as they are the most widespread and abun-
dant phagotrophic ﬂagellates in soil, where they are
major predators on bacteria, and easy to grow in the
lab; they also occur widely in freshwater and some Cer-
comonas are marine. Molecular methods will be used to
pioneer study of the ecology and population structure
of speciﬁc genetic lineages of sarcomonads, primarily in
soil, and to clarify their systematics and evolution more
generally. The primary focus of this project is the role
of sarcomonads in soil community ecology - in partic-
ular to provide the ﬁrst evidence for the adaptiveness
of individual genotypes for phagotrophic predatory soil
protozoa.
The student will use rDNA sequencing, quantitative
PCR, and DNA hybridization to study the qualitative
and quantitative distribution of diﬀerent selected Cer-
comonas ribotypes among habitats, through the sea-
sons, and across environmental gradients, and for se-
lected subclades expand the ribotype database and seek
correlations with morphology. S/he will also do large-
scale chaperone Hsp90 gene sequencing for cultures of
the most abundant ribotypes of Heteromita, Bodomor-18 EvolDir April 1, 2005
pha and Cercomonas to determine whether they are
haploid or diploid and whether they are sexual or asex-
ual. If they are sexual the 18S rRNA and Hsp90 se-
quences of closely related genotypes can be used to de-
ﬁne biological species boundaries and will provide ge-
netic tools for comparing the ecology of sister species.
The student will make use of our numerous existing
cultures of Cercomonas, add to them considerably, and
generate many more for heteromitids. BACKGROUND
Soil and aquatic sediment ecosystems centrally involve
decomposer food webs in which microbes are of major
importance for biogeochemical cycles and where pro-
tozoa are the dominant consumers of bacteria. Of the
13 protozoan phyla with very distinctive body plans
now recognised, only three or four play really major
roles in all habitats (Amoebozoa, Ciliophora, Cerco-
zoa, and to a lesser extent Euglenozoa). Recent work
using environmental rRNA library screening and inten-
sive culturing of the latter two phyla in my laboratory
has shown that Cercozoa comprise thousands of species,
many belonging to previously undetected major clades.
Cercozoa now has 10 classes, representing huge morpho-
logical diversity, including testate, ﬁlose, and reticulate
amoebae, ﬂagellates, algae, and organisms previously
classiﬁed as heliozoa, radiolaria, and even fungi; one of
these, the sarcomonads, consists primarily of biciliate
ﬂagellates that glide on surfaces and can often form a
wide variety of pseudopods during feeding. High levels
of cercozoan diversity have been found in most environ-
ments sampled; some appear to be restricted to marine
environments, others to non-marine, while some strains
appear to ﬂourish in both. In many microbial commu-
nities Cercozoa appear to be among the most abundant
predators. They commonly eat bacteria and unicellu-
lar fungi, but are also known to digest larger organ-
isms, and the phylum includes at least two parasitic
classes. Some unicellular strains can form large, retic-
ulose, multinucleate plasmodia, the function of which
is unclear. It is thus probably the most diverse but
least studied of all protozoan phyla and thus the scope
for exciting novel discoveries is immense. Our recent
molecular phylogenetic studies provided tools that now
make detailed study of their ecology possible for the
ﬁrst time despite their taxonomy still being relatively
chaotic and very ill-developed. Our lab provides an ex-
cellent environment for this research as there would be
a second student and a postdoctoral researcher (David
Bass) also working on Cercozoan evolution and ecology,

of social communication in archaic New Zealand frogs
(genus Leiopelma). These frogs are “living fossils” that
have remained virtually unchanged over the past 200
million years and never evolved bioacoustic signalling
systems. Leiopelma are extremely long-lived, do not
stray far from small home ranges, and repeatedly in-
teract with the same individuals. These conditions fos-
ter the formation of complex social networks, which
might be structured through chemical signalling. The
project takes an integrative approach and makes use
of microsatellite analyses to investigate genetic related-
ness, chemical methods to characterise the signals, and

ULeicester EvolImmunology
Research council funded PhD studentship Opening a
blackbox in evolutionary immunology. Parasites are
ubiquitous and aﬀect a wide array of host character-
istics at all levels of biological organization. Conse-
quently, understanding their relationships has impor-
tant ramiﬁcations for a variety of scientiﬁc ﬁelds.
The interaction between the bumblebee and its try-
panosomal gut parasite Crithidia bombi1 has become
one of the central models for the study of the evolu-
tionary ecology of immune systems 2. However, so far
this system has been considered as a black box. For our
understanding of the system to develop, more must be
known about the speciﬁcs of the host parasite relation-
ship.
This studentship will delve into the mechanisms of their
interactions. What is the actual pathology of C.bombi?
Its ﬁtness eﬀects on bumblebees are well known 3, 4 but
what tissues or processes are actually damaged? On the
host side, many details are now known about the insect
immune system5, but what components of this system
are used by the bumblebee to defend against this gut
parasite 6? And what is the basis of the well-known
speciﬁcity between diﬀerent strains of Crithidia and in-
dividual bumblebee colonies2.
Previous studies have shown that C. bombi can arti-
ﬁcially infect Drosophila7. One exciting possible re-
search direction is to use the candidate gene approach8
to transfer knowledge from this artiﬁcial system into C.
bombi1s natural host, the bumblebee.
Many parasites, including important species that aﬀect
humans and livestock, must survive the harsh environ-
ment of insect guts to complete their life-cycle. Hence,
understanding how insects protect themselves against
such parasites has immediate practical implications.
At a minimum, applicants should have or expect to
receive an upper second class honours degree in biology
or a related discipline. Send your CV (including names

Department of Biology, University of Oslo, Norway.
A 3-year PhD position in evolutionary biology (my-
cology) is currently being oﬀered at the Dep. of
Biology, University of Oslo, Norway ( <http://-
www.biologi.uio.no/ >www.biologi.uio.no ). The posi-
tion relates to the research project “Evolution of mating
type and vegetative incompatibility genes in fungi: The
dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans as a model species”.
The project is a collaboration between researcher at
the University of Oslo and at the Agricultural Univer-
sity of Uppsala, Sweden. The project is funded by the
Research Council of Norway and the PhD position will
be based at the University of Oslo, Norway.
The research project to which the position is linked
includes evolutionary, phylogeographic and population
genetic studies of fungi using the basidiomycete Ser-
pula lacrymans and allied taxa as model organisms.
One important aim is to explore evolutionary processes
that inﬂuence the mating and vegetative incompatibil-
ity systems in fungi. Studies within the project will in-
clude a combination of molecular laboratory work and
culturing of fungi, in addition to some ﬁeld work. The
PhD plan of the appointed candidate will be aﬀected by
the candidate’s interests and competence within these
ﬁelds and there will be considerable scope for the stu-
dent to develop their own interests. Knowledge of the
Norwegian language is not required.
Qualiﬁcations of importance in assessing candidates in-
clude:- Motivation - Educational background - Practice with
basic molecular techniques (PCR, DNA sequencing,
etc.) - Experience in culturing fungi (or other microor-
ganisms) - Good knowledge in evolutionary biology -
Ability to work both independently and in a group -
Experience in presenting scientiﬁc material - written
and oral
The decision on whom to appoint will essentially con-
sider the applicants’ potential for conducting a success-
ful PhD project of high quality. Short-listed candidates
will likely be interviewed. Deadline for the receipt of
applications is March 30. The starting date is ﬂexible.
The position is for three years within which the candi-
date appointed is expected to complete her/his PhD.

Evolution, gene discovery, and lateral gene transfer in
the ecologically most important soil Protozoa: Cerco-
zoa
3 year NERC-funded DPhil (=PhD) studentship super-
vised by Professor T. Cavalier-Smith FRS in the De-
partment of Zoology, starting 1 October 2005.
RE-POSTING: EXTENDED DEADLINE - NOW 27
MAY 2005.
A major very recent advance in understanding eukary-
ote evolution has been the recognition that protozoa
belonging to the phylum Cercozoa (established only in
1998 by Cavalier-Smith), together with Foraminifera
and Radiolaria, constitute Rhizaria, one of ﬁve major
supergroups forming the eukaryote evolutionary tree.
Understanding the evolution, physiology, and ecology
of this major branch of the tree of life is severely lim-
ited by the complete absence of any genome project
for it. To ﬁll this major gap the student would do
high-throughput sequencing of thousands of genes from
C-DNA libraries of ~5 phylogenetically ill-resolved and22 EvolDir April 1, 2005
ecologically diverse cercozoan classes, and analyse them
bioinformatically and phylogenetically. Cercozoa, as
the only culturable rhizarians, are the best rhizarian
targets for gene discovery by large-scale cDNA sequenc-
ing.
Aims:
1. Quantitate gene transfer from food bacteria into cer-
cozoan genomes ( ~1% expected). 2. Discover genes as-
sociated with diverse cercozoan lifestyles. 3. Determine
whether these heterotrophs have any genes supporting
the theory of a photosynthetic ancestry for Cercozoa.
4. Construct multigene trees to settle evolutionary re-
lationship among major classes of Cercozoa and test
the theory that Rhizaria are sisters of excavate proto-
zoa. 5. Follow up unexpected serendipitous discoveries
of the C-DNA sequencing in accordance with the stu-
dent’s interests

plication closing dates are given in the University of Ox-
ford Graduate Prospectus ( www.admin.ox.ac.uk/gsp ).

MAY 2005.
Cercozoa (established by Cavalier-Smith, 1998), the
most abundant phylum of soil protozoa, includes nu-
merous zooﬂagellates and amoebae with long thin pseu-
dopods adapted to creeping around soil particles. This
project focuses on heteromitids and Cercomonas, the
most widespread and abundant phagotrophic ﬂagellates
in soil, where they are major predators on bacteria, and
easy to grow in the lab. Chaperone Hsp90 genes will be
sequenced for cultures of the most abundant ribotypes
of Heteromita, Bodomorpha, and Cercomonas to deter-
mine whether they are haploid or diploid and by seek-
ing intragenic recombination determine whether they
are sexual or asexual. If they are sexual the 18S rRNA
and Hsp90 sequences of closely related genotypes will be
used to deﬁne biological species boundaries and provide
genetic tools for comparing the ecology of sister species.
The student will use our numerous existing cultures of
Cercomonas, add to them considerably, and generate
many more for heteromitids. The environmental adap-
tiveness of diﬀerent rRNA genotypes will be studied
by rDNA sequencing, quantitative PCR, and DNA hy-
bridization to study the qualitative and quantitative
distribution of diﬀerent selected Cercomonas ribotypes
among habitats, through the seasons, and across envi-
ronmental gradients, and for selected subclades expand
the ribotype database and seek correlations with mor-
phology.

Position
A four-year PhD-position in evolutionary biology is
open from approximately 1st of Mai at the University
of Tromsø, Norway. Applicants must document knowl-
edge about Evolutionary Biology equivalent to mas-
ter level and should have experience from ﬁeld-work
in Behavioral Ecology. Applicants must also be willing
to acquire knowledge about new methodology in cell-
biology and immunology, and documented knowledge
from these areas is an advantage. Speciﬁc knowledge
about sperm cells is also an advantage, but not obliga-
tory.
Project description
Mutations in the male germ-line are common and in
highly monogamous species males may beneﬁt from
selecting against own, mutated sperm. This will, in
turn, reduce a male’s chance of fertilizing, but, on the
other hand, prevent loss of DNA order down the family
line. The importance of sperm selection by the male
will be related to the intensity of sperm competition.
That is, in species with high levels of sperm competi-
tion male selection against own sperm will impose high
ﬁtness costs and therefore be selected against. Conse-quently, a lowered control of mutated sperm could ex-
plain the increased mutations rates - originating from
the male germ-line - documented to co-occur with in-
creased sperm competition. Identiﬁcation of mutated
sperm cells are most likely conducted by the immune
system, which also surveys other somatic cells, and an-
tibody coating of sperm cells are commonly observed in
male vertebrates. The evolutionary framework outlined
may explain some puzzling biological paradoxes, such
as: why should the male, but not the female germ-line
be non-self, why should stress and sex hormones be im-
munosuppressive and why do we observe the enormous
sperm redundancy.
Practicalities
Application dead-line is 7st of April.
25% of the work-load (equivalent to 1 year) will be
teaching in Life History Evolution.
Applications should include ﬁve copies of conﬁrmed
documents, including CV, and three copies of publi-
cations and manuscripts. These should be sent to:

We seek a highly motivated individual interested in pur-
suing a PhD degree in Evolutionary Genetics within a
newly started research program on the evolution of re-
productive systems in fungi.
Project description The diﬀerences in reproductive be-
haviour of organisms greatly aﬀect patterns of genetic
variation, and therefore the responses of populations to
natural selection and other factors of evolution. Discov-
ering why and how these characters evolve poses some
of the most challenging problems in evolutionary biol-
ogy. Neurospora is a eukaryote model system excep-
tionally suited as a subject for studies of the evolution
of reproductive systems. The species of the genus ex-
hibit the range of reproductive behaviour seen through-
out fungi: obligately outbreeding, selﬁng, and a mix-
ture of the two. This PhD-project aims at 1) identifying24 EvolDir April 1, 2005
genes and genetic mechanisms important for outcross-
ing in Neurospora, and investigating the evolutionary
fate of these characters in selﬁng lineages; 2) Identify-
ing trade oﬀs in energy allocation as a potential driving
force in the evolution of selﬁng taxa from their out-
breeding ancestors.
The project will involve using molecular techniques
such as DNA sequencing, quantitative PCR and whole
genome microarrays, as well as statistical analyses. Al-
though the general area of the work is already de-
ﬁned, there will be considerable scope for the stu-
dent to develop their own interests and to inﬂuence
the emphasis of their project within the broad area
speciﬁed. The announced position is planned for four
years. Requirements Applicants should possess a BSc
or MSc degree in evolutionary genetics, microbiology,
ecology, population genetics, or a related ﬁeld, and
should have a strong interest in using molecular meth-
ods to study key questions in ecology and evolution.
General microbiology and molecular biology laboratory
skills are a plus. Application Please submit your CV,
a letter describing your research interest and skills, a
copy of master thesis or equivalent, and contact in-
formation for two references to Hanna Johannesson

shaped by evolution. We have ongoing projects on
age-speciﬁc schedules of mortality, reproduction and
growth, on the evolution of senescence, on reproductive
eﬀort, parental investment and intergenerational trans-
fers, on environmentally-cued life-history choices, and

ABIGeneMapper Alternative
Dear Evoldir members,
Does anyone know of an alternative software to ABI’s
GeneMapperTM? For now I’m forced to use the com-
puter that is connected to the ABI sequencer to be
able to process my samples (microsatellites). I would
like to be able to analyze my samples on my desktop
but the Stand-alone install of GeneMapper has too high
demands on my computer for this to work.
All the best,
Jens

Analysis with Arlequin
Dear all,
We are trying to analyze a group of sequences with
Arlequin and are ﬁnding a basic problem that we are
hoping somebody may have encountered previously.
Some information about the data: -the data comes from
direct sequencing of PCR fragments of a nuclear gene,
from a diploid species. Therefore, the heterozygotes for
a SNP apear with the degenerate code (R, Y, etc).
-We build the input with the diﬀerent haplotypes found
in each population
The problem: -we cannot get the program to interpret
the degenerate code. The way things are going now,
it dismisses any SNP position with a degenerate codeApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 37
and therefore interprets all the haplotypes as being the
same.
We tried changing several parameters with no luck. I
am hoping we simply ignored a simple detail about
this... but I could not ﬁnd any speciﬁc information
in the manual- both sequence examples provided in the
program DO NOT include degenerate sequences.
Thanks for any help!

Analysis with Arlequin answers
Dear all,
We posted a couple of questions about using Arlequin
to analyze sequence data from nuclear genes a few days
ago. Many folks sent me several nice ideas and many
others asked to know the answers I got. I ﬁgured it
would be easier to just post what I thought was most
signiﬁcant:
Here is what I previously posted: >Some information
about the data: >-the data comes from direct sequenc-
ing of PCR fragments of a nuclear >gene, from a diploid
species. Therefore, the heterozygotes for a SNP apear
>with the degenerate code (R, Y, etc). > >-We build

>The problem: >-we cannot get the program to inter-
pret the degenerate code. The way things are >going
now, it dismisses any SNP position with a degenerate
code and therefore interprets all the >haplotypes as
being the same.
The solutions/answers: -even though the manual says
so, arlequin does not interpret sequence degenerate
codes, at least for the type of data we have (diploid,
unknown phase)-there are two basic ways to deal with the situation: (1)
one can convert the sequence data into genotypes at the
variable sites/SNPs and analize the data that way, as
genotypic data, phase unknown.
(2) there are ways to predict haplotypes from this type
of data, which can then be inputed into arlequin, and
other programs, as phase known haplotypes, etc. See
Kidd et al. 2000 Am. J. Hum. Gen.
Many thanks to all of you who tried to help us!

BAPS software users
I’ve received emails from BAPS sw users, who have
been puzzled with certain aspects of the analysis done
by the program. Unfortunately, the user manual has
not been speciﬁc enough on some details, so I wish to
make users aware of certain functionality. The text be-
low is also added to the BAPS webpage. Best Jukka
An announcement to the users of BAPS software. The
following important aspects concerning functionality
were previously not clearly indicated in the manual.
Hint #1! You can ﬁll as many K values into the BAPS
3.1 input window as you wish, e.g. like 200 hundred val-
ues. This option makes the sensitivity analysis based
on many estimation runs with an equal K much sim-
pler. The input ﬁeld simply shifts to the right when it
becomes ﬁlled. So the input could look like:
10 10 10 10 10 10 11 11 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 13 13 13
13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 etc.
What the program does for each K value (even the repli-
cates of the same value) is to ﬁnd the optimal partitions
with k ¨U K, it stores these internally, and the after all K
values have been processed, it merges the stored results38 EvolDir April 1, 2005
according to the logml values. Even if small k values are
considered a priori possible, they can have extremely
bad ﬁt compared to the larger values, in which case
they are ignored in the results.
Hint #2! For those who have used Structure sw previ-
ously, the diﬀerence in the use of K may be confusing.
Please, do not enter the K=1 into the ﬁeld, since it is
meaningless value for BAPS (the estimation algorithm
of BAPS still considers k=1 to be a plausible number
of clusters a priori).

Bootstrapping loci individuals
I am wondering which bootstrap technique (individuals
versus loci) is most appropriate for gauging conﬁdence
in the genetic diﬀerentiation between populations. I
am reticent about bootstrapping over individuals as to
me they do not appear to be independent (i.e. they are
related). I would like to know which method is most ap-
propriate for my needs (determining conﬁdence in the
relationships between populations), and also perhaps
examples of where you would use each method.
My ruminations to date: I suppose both are valid (or
else they wouldn’t both be available in software by peo-
ple much more learned than I), but it will depend on
the question you ask.
Bootstrapping across individuals (which I am not en-
tirely cool with since data points are not independent -
they are related, at least to some degree, which will, to
me anyway, will necessarily bias estimates in favour of
diﬀerentiation) would enable you to gauge conﬁdence
in how well your samples support diﬀerentiation be-
tween populations. Taken this way, you assume that
the distribution of genetic variation in your samples is
representative of the populations as a whole.
In contrast, bootstrapping across loci gauges how well
the genome supports diﬀerentiation. Here, obviously,
you assume that your loci are representative of the dis-
tribution of diﬀerentiation between populations across
the genome as a whole. A major potential problem here
is that a handful of loci may be unlikely to accurately
portray this distribution (but clearly this is an implicit
problem with every population genetics study under the
sun). The eﬃciency of bootstrapping when sample sizesare small (i.e. a handful of loci) may be pertinent here,
though I am not up on the bootstrapping literature.
You can imagine a locus that is quite unrepresentative
may bias your results (e.g. 2 populations have a partic-
ular allele in high frequency, due solely to homoplasy).
In that case, going the individual-route might be more
appropriate as the real-variance is better approximated
with the much larger sample size of individuals. At the
other extreme, if you know your samples are good (for
example, you have sampled all individuals), then boot-
strapping loci would seem more appropriate to me as
the variance due to sampling individuals is zero.
I guess the thing to do is bootstrap whichever sample
distribution (individuals or loci) you think best approx-
imates the variance of the respective real distributions
(population or genome). It may very well be that both
distributions are equally well approximated, and would
therefore deliver similar bootstrap proportions.
Long story short, the two tests seem complementary.
Despite reservations, I think I would report bootstrap
proportions across individuals. I would defend this by
saying that 1) I assume my microsatellites are represen-
tative because they are putatively randomly distributed
across the genome, or 2) the results are true given the
data used (which happens to also be the only data avail-
able), and are open to debate with new data. Any input
on this problem would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Bootstrapping loci individuals
answers
I recently sent out a message asking whether bootstrap-
ping across individuals or loci is appropriate for gaug-
ing the conﬁdence in relationships between populations,
but I see from some of the responses that my questionApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 39
could have been posed better. I thank everyone who
replied so far, but I’d like to restate the question.
I am working in a population genetics framework and
have genotyped many individuals for each of several
populations for a dozen microsatellite loci. I know
which pairwise populations are signiﬁcantly diﬀerenti-
ated as determined through the non-parametric permu-
tation approach of Excoﬃer et al. (1992). My initial
query really had to do with constructing a population
dendrogram showing the relationships between popula-
tions. The program POPULATIONS (Olivier Langella)
oﬀers bootstrapping across individuals or loci using 15
diﬀerent diﬀerentiation metrics. My question, then, is
which of these two options is most appropriate (or even
if both are statistically valid). To reiterate, I feel ret-
icent about bootstrapping across individuals because
they are not statistically independent (they are re-
lated). Please read the former message (below) for more
ruminations. Thanks. Joseph. (josephwb@umich.edu)

Consensus patterns
Dear all
We are working with protein interaction data and
peptide-domain interactions obtained from high-
throughput experiments. We would like to obtain for a
list of peptides the consensus pattern.40 EvolDir April 1, 2005
I have found many useful websites where I can gener-
ate a proﬁle from multiple sequence alignment but what
would be really useful will be a tool where I can feed a
list of short peptides (not aligned) and obtained a con-
sensus (so the alignment is also done automatically in
the moment I give the input).
I will keep searching, but in case you know of anything
doing this I would be grateful if you could let me know.

DNA from bloodApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 41
Dear EvolDir members,
I have one question to submit to the group:
One proposes us to study DNA polymorphisms in an
Ameridian population. Nevertheless, the sample is
composed of glycerolized red cells. So do you think it

Ernst Mayr passing
Ernst Mayr, perhaps the most inﬂuential evolutionist
in the world during the 20th century, died on Thurs-
day, February 3, 2005. He was well into his 100th year,
enjoying good health until near the end. In hand were
several more manuscripts that he would have published
had he lived longer.
Mayr’s inﬂuence was wide and deep. His two major
works on evolution and systematics (Mayr 1942, 1963)
are still read today. He was a constant innovator of
systematic nomenclature (Mayr 1978). Mayr’s books
on the history of biology (Mayr and Provine, 1980,
Mayr 1982), and on the philosophy of biology (Mayr
1988) had a major inﬂuence on both ﬁelds. Between
Mayr and Richard C. Lewontin, Harvard’s Museum of
Comparative Zoology became the center of training for
young historians and philosophers of biology.
Mayr was a forceful writer, and never hesitated to chal-
lenge his colleagues. Naturally, he had many detractors,
whom he relished. His ideas endured much criticism
from me, but he never wavered as a friend and advisor.
The worst thing, he claimed, was being ignored. After42 EvolDir April 1, 2005
roundly criticizing the contributions of population ge-
netics to evolutionary biology (Mayr 1959), Mayr later
nominated Sewall Wright for the Balzan Prize, and at-
tended the award ceremony in Italy when Wright won
the prize. When Theodosius Dobzhansky published
his Genetics and the Origin of Species in 1937, Mayr
pointed out to him with glee that the ﬁgure of a cell
division on the spine of the book had the chromosomes
backward (Dobzhansky was an accomplished cytologist,
and had not noticed).
Finally, no notice of his death has mentioned his prodi-
gious production of correspondence over his lifetime.
He answered nearly every letter that reached him, and
initiated much correspondence. His inﬂuence through
correspondence will have to be evaluated in the future
and I predict it will be immense.

Formalin DNA
Dear evoldir members, I would like to submit two ques-
tions to the group: (1) We are looking for a contact
person in China, who could help us to obtain “Pseu-
dorasbora parva” specimens from the Amur (and even-
tually other chinese rivers) for genetical purposes. (2)
I am also interested to hear about (working) protocols
for DNA extraction from formalized tissue. We ob-
tained some samples from freshwater ﬁsh (caught about
4 months ago) that are ﬁxed in formaline and after-
wards have been put in ethanol. Is there any chance to
get genetical information from these samples?? Does
someone has experience with that? Kind regards, Di-

Glycoside Hydrolases
Dear all
I am a phD student and Ive began working with pro-
teins, mainly glycoside hydrolases. Well, I ve been
trying to get all sequences avaliable on computer data
banks, but the tools for searching are not so eﬃcient.
So, does anybody know a tool I could use so I could
type, for exemple: glycoside hydrolases and get all the
sequences; or if I would type glycoside hydrolases fam-
ily 5, I would get all sequences from family 5 not along
with other sequences that contains in their names the
number 5 or the word family. I am just not being able
to ﬁnd a constrain for the search.
It would be nice to receive some clues! Thanks

Individual genetic distances
Hi there, I’m currently trying to ﬁnish my master’s the-
sis and I’ve run into a problem with my analysis. I have
microsatellite data for 9 loci for a single population that
contains 1) bisexual species and 2) related unisexual hy-
brids. I want to generate a genetic distance matrix at44 EvolDir April 1, 2005
an individual level for my multi-locus genotype data,
that will allow me to compare graphically the genetic
relatedness between the hybrids and sympatric bisex-
uals. However, I can’t seem to ﬁnd a program that
will allow me to generate a genetic distance matrix for
genotype data at an individual level (as compared to
a sub-population level through allele frequencies). I’ve
hit a wall here and so if anyone can help me ﬁgure
out how to do this analysis, I’d be super appreciative.
Thanks so much in advance! Cadhla

Kansas Evolution Hearings
Dear Colleagues,
You may be receiving calls or e-mails from the Kansas
Department of Education oﬀering you a free, all ex-
pense paid trip to Kansas to testify in hearings com-
paring evolution and “intelligent design”. Though that
is doubtless a terriﬁc draw for any of us, especially in
March, I would encourage you to please consider the
views of the local pro-science group, Kansas Citizens
for Science ( www.kcfs.org ). KCFS has been closely in-
volved in this battle from the beginning and has been
tracking the Board of Education’s shifting attempts to
have public hearings giving equal time to intelligent de-
sign and evolution.
KCFS expresses the view that the event to which you
are being invited is a “Kangaroo Court”, with sci-
ence (and evolution) on trial, and that participation
by members of the science and education communities
will only hurt the cause of science education in Kansas.
Please read their views, posted here: http://-
www.kcfs.org/standards05/Press.release.3-3-05.html
The kernel of their position is that the hearings are a
sham (not an opportunity to “defend science”) that
have been organized for political purposes. KCFS
writes:
“KCFS asserts that the proposed hearings by the board
committee not be held. First, the minority report (rea-
son for the hearings) has received peer-review and found
to be lacking. Despite opportunities to do so, Dr. Bill
Harris, primary author of the minority report has re-
fused to answer these challenges to his scientiﬁc credi-
bility. We don’t need additional comment when currentcomment has not been answered. Second, Dr. John
Marburger, White House science advisor has made it
clear that the White House, the administrative branch
of our government, considers evolution to be the cor-
nerstone of modern biology and rejects ID as a science
theory. Obviously he has failed to grasp the proposed
deﬁnition in the Kansas minority report. Third, the
hearings are a sham as we all know that Connie Morris
and Kathy Martin ran for oﬃce on anti-evolution plat-
forms. Steve Abrams introduced the creationist sub-
standards which were approved in 1999. These are the
three individuals who will act as the board committee
judge and jury of the scientiﬁc credibility of evolution.
Fourth, it is unclear whether these proposed hearings
are to inform the board on matters of science, or in-
form the public at large. Either way, the hearings are
a sham.”
The KCFS has expressed its views in resolu-
tion form, at http://www.kcfs.org/standards05/-
KCFS.resolution.html The key provision is their
concern that “The science community should not put
itself in the position of participating in a rigged hearing
where non-scientists will appear to sit in judgment
and ﬁnd science lacking. Science should not give
the anti-evolution members of the board the veneer
of respectability when they take their predictable
action. Let the board take responsibility for its actions
without dignifying those actions with the appearance
of academic rigor.”
If you have any questions, feel free to get back to me,
or to one of the KCfS members such as Jack Krebs,
jkrebs@sunﬂower.com

MHC diﬀerentiationApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 45
Dear people,
We try to analyse population diﬀerentiation using ge-
nomic copies of the MHC (Major Histocompatibility
Complex). Because there are many duplicated genes in
our species (guppies), we cannot assign alleles to loci.
Therefore, Fst and genetic distance measures (Dm and
Ds) seem inappropriate.
Are there established methods to analyse these data?
Thanks in advance!

Microsat electrophoresis answers
Dear Colleagues, I posted my question about selecting
Microsatellite electrophoresis few weeks ago. Thank
you very for your suggestions.
We silver stain microsatellite loci, and have been do-
ing this for a number of years. The gel rigs we use are
from Biorad, we have two sizes of gel but the most user
friendly are the short fat gels (38 x 30 cm) onto which
you can load 96 samples plus controls. The gels arevery easy to use. The power packs are also Biorad, but
this is probably because we got a good deal on them.
Then we use pre-measured silver staining reagents from
Promega, which probably isn’t the cheapest way of do-
ing things but having everything pre-measured is a huge
time saver. Hope this helps Jo
I used a Hoefer SE660 vertical gel for analysing hu-
man derived tetranucleotide loci in baboons (see http:/-
/www.hoeferinc.com/product.asp?ProdID=32 ). This
system allows you to run four gels simultaneously
and up to 100 lanes. I got very clean results us-
ing 1mm thick 8% non-denaturing acrylamide (29:1
acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gels which were then stained
with silver. Ive attached a picture as an example the al-
leles closest together diﬀer by 1 repeat unit. I also tried
to look at dinucleotide loci (this time from gazelles), but
I found these more diﬃcult to resolve because the al-
leles were closer together and there were more stutter
bands than with the tetranucleotide loci. An alterna-
tive might be to consider a Spreadex gel. These are pre-
formed gels and run on a horizontal system and can be
stained with SYBR green. Never used them myself but
other people say they are very good. They are proba-
bly signiﬁcantly more expensive than acrylamide. The
Elchrom site is found at http://www.elchrom.com/-
public/index.php?article=144 . Good luck and I hope
that this helps. Please feel free to contact me again if
you need any more info. Cheers Rob.
During my phd I used big slab gels (the old sequenc-
ing rigs) I would attach the gel to one of the plates
using some sigma product which i could ﬁnd in an old
lab note book if you need it. Anyways the protocal
for this method at least the actual silver staining part
is in Morgan et al 2003 J heredity which is attached.
This protocol worked very well for my needs, but given
the cheapness of dye labeled primers I might do a cost
beniﬁt analysis before you spend tons of money on sil-
ver staining chemicals. I guess that all hinges on you
having access to a sequencer or gel scanner. Hope this
helps. Ted
I am working with microsatellites in Mexico on sea-
grasses. I am using the electrophoresis set of Biorad
(Sequigen GT) it is a bit expensive, but it works ﬁne.
I am using the 38 x 50 cm gels, and load them 2 times.
this gives me (if lucky), results of 120 samples. To es-
timate size I use 10 bp ladder of invirtogen!
Hope this will help.
Yours,
Kor-jent
Hi I use the OWL Scientiﬁc vertical rigs. The S3S
model. 18002425560. When you order it you get two46 EvolDir April 1, 2005
sets of plates. I these rigs more than BWR because the
buﬀer tends to leak from top to bottom on those. If you
are using silver staining they plates work pretty well
with the promega silver sequence staining reagents... I
never seem to have much trouble with it. Lee Dear
Binh, I’m using Biorad Sequigen. It’s just wonderful
:-) It uses large amount of buﬀer but thanks to it there
are almost no smiles on gel. In my opinion the best set
is 30x38 with 0,4mm spacers (thinner gels have prob-
lems with reaching the desired temperature in prerun).
If you’re going to analyse large sets of samples I advise
you to buy 100 Shark Tooth Comb. I’m silver staining
on longer plate as it’s easier to manipulate - don’t forget
to change the picture form the camera as the samples
are in reverse order. You could also load it in reverse
order :) Good luck! Maciek

Phenotypes Genes
Dear All, I have a question about gene variation in re-
lationship to phenotype diversity that needs your help
to clarify:
If two species are diﬀerent in phenotype (say fruit color
red vs, blue) and they hybridize in nature. The hy-
brids show diﬀerences in fruit color phenotypes (say
some have red fruits, some have blue and some have
a mosaic of red and blue). For a gene contributes to
the color diﬀerence, do we expect to see an associa-
tion or correlation between the fruit phenotypes and
gene sequences in the hybrid populations? Whereas no
such correlations should be observed for a gene that has
nothing to do with the fruit color? Is this correct?
If you observe a correlation between the phenotypes
and the sequences of a gene regulates the pathways of
the pigments synthesis, could you infer that diﬀerence
in the gene is potentially linked to the diﬀerence in the
phenotypes?
Your thoughts and opinions about this would be very
helpful and highly appreciated. Thanks! Sincerely,
Jenny Xiang

I think the key idea you are struggling towards is that
of QTLs - quantitative trait loci.
You can detect such loci by following the co- inheritance
of DNA markers and traits such as colour in crosses.
You might even detect the loci that are involved in the
trait with much work.
You could do a literature with the term qtl in it.
For example on the scirus.com site. I had a ﬁrst shot
at it for you. See here
http://www.scirus.com/srsapp/search?q=-
qtl+cross++lines+colour&ds=jnl&g=s&t=al l
$$$$$
This is regarding your query on the evolution directory.
This is an interesting question! One would expect asso-
ciation (linkage disequilibrium, LD) between the gene
locus and the trait if the gene indeed controls the trait.
If the genetic architecture of the trait is not too com-
plex, this association might be detectable in natural
hybrid populations. However, there are other factors
as well that can cause LD in hybrid populations, and
you would have to control for these. E.g.: (1) In both
experimental and natural hybrid populations, the cross-
ing of two species induces LD between many or all loci
in the genome, and these associations are expected to
decay in subsequent generations. (2) Persistent genetic
structure (population subdivision) in the hybrid popu-
lation also causes LD across the genome. (3) Selection
that favors particular gene combinations (epistatic se-
lection) can do the same. So one would have to control
very carefully for these factors. If they are all taken into
account, it may be possible to interpret associations be-
tween genes and traits in natural hybrid populations.
There is some recent literature on this topic, please let
me know if you need some references. I also worked on
this topic myself a little in the recent past, and I have
a project running that addresses these questions in treeApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 47
hybrid zones.
#####
You’d need to be extremely cautious about making that
assumption. If the hybrids are variable in their status
(e.g. some F1s, some B1 to either parental species,
some advanced-generation intercrosses and introgres-
sions), one would expect to ﬁnd associations between
fruit color and almost any gene in the genome. For ex-
ample, in this circumstance, red-fruited hybrids would
on average carry a higher proportion of the red-fruited
species genome than blue-fruited hybrids, so red fruit
would show an association with almost any allele that
is at substantially higher frequency in the red-fruited
species than in the blue-fruited species. Such associa-
tions would be strong evidence for linkage only if (a)
all the hybrids were of the same generation (e.g. F2);
or (b) the population were a hybrid swarm many gen-
erations old that has undergone random mating among
the hybrids and no mating with the parental species. In
(a) you could still get association due to linkage with
a causative gene on the same chromosome, similar to
linkage mapping. In (b) the region of linkage disequi-
librium would be much smaller but would still probably
encompass more than a single gene. Thus, even in these
situations, I’d only treat allele-phenotype associations
as evidence for causation if the gene were a functional
candidate.
If the status of the hybrids is variable or unknown, it
may still be possible to test associations by controlling
for ancestry; e.g. using Pritchard’s STRUCTURE pro-
gram, but this would require scoring a genome-wide set
of markers to provide data on ancestry. Anyway, good
luck!!
$$$$$
Before making any inferences with regards the role of
your candidate “red vs blue” gene a degree of veriﬁca-
tion needs to be carried out. If you did ﬁnd sequence
polymorphisms that cosegregate with fruit colour then
this is an indication that the gene controls the pheno-
type, however could be due to genetic linkage. Tests
can be carried out in a number of ways - QTL mapping
will show if the gene/trait are linked, however isnt con-
crete proof. You could grow up an F2 of, say, 10000
plants and (if single gene control) genotype the 2500
reds and 2500 blues to check the sequence polymor-
phism cosegregates (ie bulk DNA from 50 reds, pcr and
cut with an enzyme that cuts the ’red’ gene. anything
that isnt cut is a ’blue gene’ in a red plant. And the
same for blue plants/red genes. Ultimatley introducing
the blue gene into a red plant and vice versa is the acid
test. An interesting paper showing strong correlation
between DNA polymorphism and phenotypic variationis Thornsberry et al (2001) Nature genetics 28:286 Also,
it seems increasingly that developmental processes are
controlled by transcription factors and these TFs may
not show sequence polymorphism (eg

Relation s migration answers
Many thanks to all those who responded to my question
concerning the the relationship between ’s’ and rate of
migration of an allele. The original question, plus a list
of responses is given below:
My cursory conclusion were (remembering that this was
just to write a paragraph in a review) were
Rate of migration (over geographic distance) can get
confused with migration (proportional exchange be-
tween subpopulations), so its probably best to use ’wave
of advance’ or ’rate of spread’ for the former. Its a bit
clumsy, and probably not the way non-specialist would
use it, but it is at least unambiguous.
There is nothing technically wrong with Fishers’ equa-
tion or approach.
These papers use simulation to look at rate of spread
in sub-populations: Slatkin, M. (1976). The rate of
spread of an advantageous allele in a subdivided popu-
lation. In “Population genetics and ecology” (S. Karlin
and E. Nevo, Eds.), pp. 767-780, Academic Press, Lon-
don. Slatkin, M. and Charlesworth, D. (1978). The

********original question*********
I have two questions concerning the relationship be-
tween the selective advantage of an allele and the rate
at which it migrates over geographic distance [for those48 EvolDir April 1, 2005
of you interested in the background: we can model or
measure the selective advantage associated with alleles
conferring drug resistance in malaria, so have estimates
of ’s’, but the alleles appear to occur very rarely and
have subsequently migrated around the world].
Intuitively there must be a positive relationship
but has it been quantiﬁed? On the basis that
Fisher/Haldane/Wright sewed up most of population
genetics in the 1920s to 1940s I tried there and was not
disappointed:
Fisher, R. A. (1937). The wave of advance of advanta-
geous genes. Ann.Eugen 7: 355-369.
who found that rate of advance was proportional to the
square root of ’s’. This paper appears to be cited only
rarely (at least in this context; it is used a lot in chem-
istry as a basis of diﬀusion of reactions) so my ﬁrst
question is whether it was ﬂawed, overlooked, or was
simply superseded by later work?
My second question pertains to island and stepping
stone models: has anyone investigated the relation-
ship between ’s’ and migration rate from these models?
Apologies if they have, but I haven’t located it because
most of the work looks at more complex questions like
maintenance of clines, genetic variability etc.
I realise I could probably do it myself using stepping
models but there is the (non-negligible) risk I would
get it wrong, it is unnecessary if it has been done al-
ready, but most importantly I just need to cite the re-
sult in a review and don’t want to have to prove it in
an appendix.
As a technical point, malaria is haploid so we need not
worry about dominance.
Thanks to those who can comment.
Regards,
Ian.

Dear Ian,
I am not sure if I am exactly replying to your question,
but you could probably get some idea from two of our
publications if you look them carefully.
1. Vogl et al. 2003 Genetics 165: 1385-1395 2. Das et
al. 2004 Genetics 168: 1975-1985 3. Baines et al. 2004
Genetics 168: 1987-1998.
In Baines et al. we have dealt with the migatrion of
the selected allele with an experimental setup and also
found evidence of cline of haplotypes across latitudinal
transects.Best wishes,

Fisher’s Wave of Advance work has not been ignored. It
has frequently been revisited by mathematicians, who
love to ring changes on it.
It is mentioned (and a simpliﬁed derivation given) in my
course notes which are available on the web: http://-
evolution.gs.washington.edu/pgbook/pgbook.html (see
pages 158-159).
It is also covered, I think, in Warren Ewens’s recent
book (2003). I think I cited it in my 1976 Annual Re-
view of Genetics review of migration work.
I wouldn’t call over 800 citations in the literature being
ignored or overlooked.

SPAGeDi 1 2
Dear evoldir members,
I wish to announce the release of a new version
of the program SPAGeDi available at: http:/-
/www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ecoevol/spagedi.html
SPAGeDi (Spatial Pattern Analysis of Genetic Di-
versity) is primarily designed to characterize the
spatial genetic structure of mapped individuals and/or
mapped populations using genotype data of any ploidy
level (assuming polysomic inhertitance in case of
polyploids). SPAGeDi runs on PC under Windows 9x
or later versions.
It can compute various statistics describing relatedness
or diﬀerentiation between individuals or populations by
pairwise comparisons, and analyze how these values are
related to geographical distances, 1) in a way similar
to a spatial autocorrelation analysis, 2) by linear re-
gressions (the slopes of these regressions can be used
to obtain indirect estimates of gene dispersal distances
parameters such as neighborhood size). SPAGeDi can
also treat data without spatial information, providing
global estimates of genetic diﬀerentiation and/or matri-
ces of pairwise statistics between individuals or popu-
lations. Data from dominant markers such as AFLP or
RAPD can also be treated to estimate pairwise kinship
or relationship coeﬃcients between individuals.
The statistics computed include Fst, Rst, Ds (Nei’s
standard genetic distance), and (delta mu)2 (Goldstein
and Pollok 1997) for analyses at the population level
and, for analyses at the individual level, pairwise kin-
ship, relatedness and fraternity coeﬃcients (with dif-
ferent estimators for each) as well as Rousset’s distance
between individuals and a kinship analogue based on
allele size. Jackknife over loci gives approximate stan-
dard errors. Permutations of locations, individuals or
genes provide ad hoc tests of spatial structure, popu-
lation diﬀerentiation or individual inbreeding, respec-
tively. A new allele size permutation test also allows to
check whether microsatellite allele sizes carry a relevant
information about genetic structure.
In addition, the actual variance of the statistics can be
estimated following the method of Ritland (2000), pro-
viding a measure necessary for marker-based inference
of the heritability or Qst of quantitative traits.
What’s new in SPAGeDi ver 1.2?Compared to the previous version 1.1, there are several
major improvements in this version :
1) SPAGeDi 1.2 proposes new statistics (e.g. Nst)
to characterize diﬀerentiation among populations using
ordered alleles, i.e. considering the phylogenetic dis-
tance between alleles (or haplotypes), as proposed by
Pons and Petit (Genetics, 1996). Speciﬁc permutation
tests permit to assess whether the allele phylogeny con-
tributes to the diﬀerentiation pattern, testing for the
occurrence of phylogeographic patterns.
2) SPAGeDi 1.2 proposes an estimator of the mean kin-
ship coeﬃcient between populations (Gij) closely re-
lated to the autocorrelation of population allele fre-
quencies (Barbujani 1987, Genetics).
3) SPAGeDi 1.2 proposes a new estimator of the rela-
tionship coeﬃcient between individuals (Li et al. 1993,
Human Heredity).
4) SPAGeDi 1.2 can consider speciﬁc reference allele
frequencies (to specify in a ﬁle) to compute relatedness
coeﬃcients between individuals.
5) SPAGeDi 1.2 includes an iterative procedure to
estimate gene dispersal parameters from isolation-by-
distance patterns by regressing pairwise kinship coeﬃ-
cients on distance over a restricted distance range (this
requires an estimate of the eﬀective population den-
sity), following Vekemans and Hardy (2004, Mol Ecol).
6) SPAGeDi 1.2 provides better error messages and the
most common errors when preparing data ﬁles are sys-
tematically listed in a ﬁle called error.txt. Empty lines
in data ﬁles are now allowed. Problems when entering
instructions with the keyboard under Windows 2000
and latter versions have been solved.

SSB Travel Award for Foreign Scholars
SSB is pleased to announce the availability of awards for
scholars from developing countries to attend workshops
and courses in systematics, or to visit a molecular lab
for training. The emphasis of this program is the trans-
fer of knowledge to the scholar’s home country. This
means that the student should currently be in their
home country, or have deﬁnite plans to return in the
near future. Courses such as the Molecular Evolution
Workshop at Woods Hole and the applied Systematics
Course at Bodega Bay are examples of courses that are
appropriate for this funding, in addition to other equiv-
alent opportunities. Support for attending a course will
be contingent on admission to the course through the
normal admissions process.
A complete application includes: 1) a justiﬁcation of
the course or planned visit, and a description of how
this will provide appropriate training (1 page max). 2)
a letter detailing how the knowledge acquired will be
transferred to the country of the scholar’s origin (1 page
max) 3) applicant’s CV
The entire application should be no more than two
pages long, not including the curriculum vitae. Ap-
plication deadline is March 31 of each year.
Requests should be sent by e-mail to Dr. Kelly R. Za-
mudio, SSB Award Committee Chair, Cornell Univer-
sity, at krz2@cornell.edu. If possible, applicants are
encouraged to use pdf format for all documents.

SSB GraduateStudentAwards
SSB Graduate Student Research Awards in Systematic
Biology
The Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) announces
its annual Graduate Student Research Award compe-
tition. The purpose of these awards is to assist stu-
dents in the initiation (ﬁrst two years) of their system-
atics projects and in the collection of preliminary data
needed by them to pursue additional sources of sup-
port (e.g., Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants
from the National Science Foundation) or to enhance
dissertation research (e.g., by visiting additional ﬁeld
collection sites or museums). Applicants may be from
any country, but must be members of SSB, and are ad-vised to join the Society as soon as possible to facilitate
their applicaions (see http://systbiol.org/ ). Previous
awardees may not re-apply, but other previous appli-
cants are encouraged to re-apply. Awards will range
between $1,000 and $2000 and up to six awards will be
made.
All applications materials this year must be in elec-
tronic format. Applicants and their recommenders are
strongly encouraged to use pdf format, rather than
Word or some other application, to minimize diﬃculty
transferring ﬁles. We strongly recommend that appli-
cants send all materials (except letters of reference) in
a single pdf ﬁle; for this you will need to use functions
in Adobe Acrobat or similar application. Letters of
recommendation should be sent by the referees in pdf
format or in the text of an e-mail; please include the
full name of applicant in letters of recommendation.
Applicants must submit 1) a curriculum vitae (one
page) 2) brief research proposal including objectives,
methods, signiﬁcance, and schedule (max. three single-
spaced pages including literature cited and any ﬁgures
and tables) 3) budget and budget justiﬁcation (1 page)
4) and arrange for two letters of recommendation; one
letter must be from the student’s current graduate ad-
visor.
The research proposal must clearly state the current
stage of the proposed research and the current year
and status of the student. Please include e-mail con-
tacts for the applicant in the application itself. Both
Masters and Ph.D. students are eligible. Systematics
is interpreted broadly to include questions below and
above the species level, molecular and morphological
approaches, and issues of pattern and process. Funding
is not limited to any particular aspect of research, but
rather is available for ﬁeld, museum/herbarium, and/or
laboratory work.
Please email all application materials and queries to:

SSB Mini-PEET Award
SSB is pleased to announce the availability of four
awards to enhance the transfer of taxonomic exper-
tise, modeled after the highly successful PEET program
at NSF. The primary purpose is to pass on taxonomic
expertise in general, therefore, unlike the NSF PEET
program, awards will not be limited to taxonomically
understudied taxa.
The awards are designed to allow SSB members (stu-
dents, post-docs, and faculty) to spend a summer or
semester apprenticed to an expert in a particular tax-
onomic group. This could include either a trip to the
taxonomists’ laboratory, or pay for the taxonomist to
visit the applicants’ laboratory for a period of time. Ap-
plicants should NOT be members of a laboratory group
currently supported by an NSF PEET award. Requests
for support may be in any amount up to $4,000.
A complete application includes:
1) a brief description of the project 2) justiﬁcation of
the importance of the taxon, and the appropriateness
of the collaborating taxonomist 3) an itemized budget
4) a CV
The entire application should be no more than two
pages long, not including the curriculum vitae. Ap-
plication deadline is March 31 of each year.
Requests should be sent by e-mail to Dr. Kelly R. Za-

SSCP analysis
Dear colleagues:
I am thinking about buying some equipment fromElChrom, in order to make some SSCPs and microsatel-
lites analysis. The equipment is the Sea2000 Elec-
trophoresis apparatus (which basically allows to keep
the temperature of the running gel constant) which is
combination with the ready-to-use- gels from the same
company will make it possible to analyse either RFLPs,
microsatellites and SSCPs. I would like to ask ﬁrst if
anyone of you has this kind of equipment. If yes, do
you recommend it? Are you happy with your results?
Even if you do not have this equipment, but are working
with SSCPs, could you explain me what kind of meth-
ods you are using. I would like to ﬁnd a more eﬃcient
(not so time consuming and more economic) way of do-
ing it (without the need of using the poliacrylamide
gels!!!).
Thanks for your help, Andreia

Sequence navigator OS10
Bonjour,
We just had the chance to receive a new Apple com-
puter G5 ... that take advantage of Mac OS 10.3.8
! They are also suposed to have a folder using the
older OS9, that we also tried to use. Unfortunately Se-
quence Navigator, an important softeware for us, is not
working well anymore. The software looks like normal
when it is “open” but the modiﬁcation done on the se-
quences became ... “surprising” ... you are never sure
on which base you interfer for exemple. The software
allows to compare multiple sequences, to compare them
to a homebuild database (convenient for identiﬁcation),
seeing simultaneously the electrophoregrams (ie result
of the sequencing machine), and even to edit and mod-
ify the sequences. Perkin Elmer sold Sequence Naviga-
tor with the sequencing machine, but doesn’t develop
it any more as far as we know. Does anybody have a
trick to use Sequence Navigator on our new fancy Mac’s
OS10? Does anyone know an other software doing the
same things so conveniently?
Thanks

Sequence navigator OS10 answers
here are the answers of kind Evoldir members who
helped to identify valuable alternatives to Sequence
Navigator
Hi,
I’m using the same G5 as you, and I solved such prob-
lem by installing the MacOS-9 Classic from the MacOS
10.3.8 installing package. Thus, when I start SeqNav
up I get into a virtual OS9 and everything works Ok!
Good luck, and have a nice day,
Eric, eric.rivera-milla@uni-konstanz.de
Hi there, we used to use sequence navigator when
analysing data for MLST. As you have found, it has
been rather left by the wayside. Nowadays we use
the STARS program, which is a free staden inter-
face developed for analysing polymorphisms within
the same stretch of DNA (available from http://-
www.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/ ˜ paediat/stars/ ). It includes
the ability to interrogate a database of alleles online and
assign them to strains. I’m not sure if this would be use-
ful for what you are doing (presumably with mycobac-
teria, yes?). You would need to work with it through
an Xwindow on your new mac. Also install STADEN
etc.
Alternatively, the new version of MEGA (MEGA3
megasoftware.net) has the ability to analyse elctro-
pherograms, align sequences etc. It’s not ideal for these
purposes but it might be better than worrying about
’surprising’ sequence modiﬁcations. You would have to
use a windows emulator on your mac, I’m afraid.
Unfortunately, these are both either UNIX (STARS) or
PC based (MEGA). But they are both free.
I hope this helps. If anyone does write in with a way
to extend the use of sequence navigator, please let me
know!
Best

Dr. W. P. Hanage, Imperial College Faculty of
Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemi-
ology, St Mary’s Hospital,
saw your post on EvolDir re. Sequence Navigator and
OSX. I suggest to check out FinchTV by Geospiza(www.geospiza.com/ﬁnchtv ) which is great for viewe-
ing traces, and has the advantage to also view the raw
data and do BLAST searches directly out of the pro-
gram. 4Peaks ( http://www.mekentosj.com/4peaks/ ) is
also great for viewing and editing (more similar to Se-
quence Navigator I think).
best of all: both are free!
if you need a good OSX program for sequence edit-
ing and contig assembly, I suggest to check out Codon
Code Aligner ( www.codoncode.com ), which is a great
program (we are using it happily since more than a
year) and has a very good licensing scheme, much more
ﬂexible than Sequencher, less than half the price (and
no dongles), and very responsive suppport if you run
into any trouble! Would be great if you could post all
replies back on EvolDir.
Good luck

Software COLONISE
Dear evoldir members,
We wish to introduce COLONISE, a user-friendly Mi-
crosoft Windows software for the study of colonization
events in natural populations. It determines the compo-
sition of the newly colonized population and makes in-
ferences about the factors that inﬂuenced individuals to
establish a new population. COLONISE uses a hierar-
chical Bayesian model to combine multilocus genotypeApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 53
data with demographic and environmental data, and a
reversible jump MCMC algorithm to perform posterior
density estimations. The software is written in C and
C++ for the graphical user interface and is available
at:
http://www2.ujf-grenoble.fr/leca/-
presentation.html#logiciels The software integrates a
tool to draw posterior density functions (histogram,
running mean, traces, etc.) and to estimate parameters
from them (mean, mode, variance, HPDI etc.)
The program can be cited as follows: Foll, M and OE
Gaggiotti. COLONISE: a computer program to study
colonisation processes in metapopulations. Molecular

Software TreeViewX
TreeView X is an open source program to display phylo-
genetic trees on Linux and Unix platforms. It can read
and display NEXUS and Newick format tree ﬁles (such
as those output by PAUP*, ClustalX, TREE-PUZZLE,
and other programs). It has a subset of the function-
ality of the version of TreeView available for the Mac
Classic and Windows.
Version 0.5 is the ﬁrst version to use the same source
code for all three major platforms (Mac OS X, Win-
dows, and Linux). There is not much more in the way
of new features compared to the previous version, apart
from a few minor tweaks concerning the ﬁle open dia-
log, and support for saving pictures (SVG on Mac OS
X, metaﬁle on Windows).Realistically this is likely to be the last release for
a while, but I thought it worthwhile to get the pro-
gram into a state where it was reasonably stable and
there was a single code base. In the past I wrote the
GUI for the Mac OS X version myself from scratch,
but version 0.5 uses the same <a href=“ http://-
www.wxwidgets.org” >wxWidgets </a>cross-platform
library for the GUI.

Tissue storage
Dear All,
I am planning to establish a long-term tissue bank
(hopefully lasting decades or longer) for molecular work
and am wondering about the best way to store DNA.
All our samples (mainly ﬁn clippings of ﬁsh) so far arestored in ethanol (90-95%), but we had previously some
problems with tissues that have been stored for several
years at room temperature. We now try to keep the
tissues at 4oC, which seems to work ﬁne, but requires
spark-proof cooling space.
What is the experience out there with ethanol sam-
ple storage? Is it necessary to keep ethanol preserved
samples at 4oC? Are there alternative methods for long
term storage?
Many thanks

Tissue storage answers
Re: Long term tissue storage
Dear All,
Thank you for all your responses on the issue of long
term tissue storage. Interestingly, there does not seem
to be a good consensus on the best storage. By far
most responses favor storage in ethanol in a cooled en-
vironment (-80oC - 4oC) though, on a larger scale,
these methods require spark proof cooling units which
are not cheap and not always feasible given local ﬁre
regulations. Preserving ethanol tissues at low temper-
ature may have the advantage over frozen tissue that
a freezer failure would not lead to the complete loss of
the collection for that reason, expensive alarm systems
would also not be required. Some scientists use DMSO,
which is easier to ship, but a nasty chemical. Desiccat-
ing methods seem to be increasingly used, though there
seems to be little experience on conservation problems
under realistic conditions. For long-term storage, many
people recommend storage in liquid nitrogen this may
not always feasible in the long term, given potential
loss of collections because of failure to reﬁll contain-
ers. However, a curating service such as that oﬀered
by the Ambrose Monell Cryo Collection at the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History may be the best option
for most of us. Below are responses, organized by the
methods they propose. I also include some useful re-
views at the end of this message.April 1, 2005 EvolDir 55
Ethanol cooled * 4 deg is much preferred unless (a)
samples are in small containers, e.g. 2ml, (which ﬁn
clips would be) with screw caps (including rubber o-
ring), have a low tissue to Etoh volume, and are not
watery tissue (ﬁn clips ok I reckon; tissue lumps less
so). Even so I would still seal any box that they are in
with tape around the lid seam and avoid warm rooms.
For big tissues (e.g. whole ﬁsh, etc.), I can’t really see
a viable way around 4 deg storage, unless you have a
robot who likes topping up and perhaps completely re-
placing Etoh periodically. (David Weetman, Hull, UK)
* If possible, I’d invest in a -80C freezer and store your
tissues (in ethanol) there. The ethanol won’t freeze but
it will be very cold and your tissue deﬁnitely won’t de-
grade. I’ve worked in a few labs (mostly birds, but
also marine mammals and other critters) and think the
ethanol/-80C combination makes the most sense (espe-
cially if your tissues are in 2ml cyrovials - or something
similar - b/c you can get an awful lot of tissue in a rela-
tively small space). (Tammy Steeves, Canterbury, NZ)
* I too have found that freezing or refrigerating ethanol
preserved samples increases the longevity of the sam-
ples for DNA extraction. In the past I have simply
transferred the samples into small cryotubes and kept
them in a -80 freezer. (Kevin Roe, Curator of Mol-
lusks, Delaware Museum of Natural History, USA) *
There was a poster at the Conservation Genetics Meet-
ing in 2001 comparing diﬀerent storage methods. I
can’t recall whose it was though. The best way to
store DNA for a long time was lyophilized DNA at -
80^C. We keep samples in alcohol (changed after the
ﬁrst day) at -80 ^C. You might also try -20 ^C, but I
strongly discourage you from trusting 4 ^C for long term
DNA preservation. (Natalia Martinkova, York, UK) *
We are keeping our collection in -80 freezers, and that
seems to work out ﬁne (specimen are preserved in 95-
100% ethanol). (Katharina Dittmar de la Cruz, BYU,
USA) * I’ve also been storing tissues, including lots of
ﬁsh, at room temp, and also in the fridge and sometimes
in a -20. I would like to hear what you ﬁnd out. And,
I’d also like to know more about the issue of spark-
proof cooling. (Sarah Cohen, SFSU, USA) * A few
years ago, I extracted DNA from invertebrates stored
in 75% EtOH since the early 1980s in room temper-
ature and I was able to amplify mtDNA without any
problems, but I personally keep my EtOH-preserved
samples at -18C (freezer) and, if I can, -80C is bet-
ter. (Sergios-Orestis Kolokotronis, American Museum
of Natural History, USA)
Ethanol at room temperature * We had insect samples
(mainly honeybees) stored for 5-7 years in 95% Ethanol
at room temperature - no problems. (Ute Kryger,
Pretoria, SA) * Our lab has not noticed any prob-lem with ambient storage of salmon tissues in ethanol
(many 10s of 1000s of ﬁn, muscle, and blood samples
in our archive). 10- or 15-year-old samples typically
amplify just ﬁne; however, I can’t say we’ve worked
with alcohol-preserved ﬁn clips much older than that.
Our greatest concern for the alcohol-preserved sam-
ples, based on anecdotes from our museum curator col-
leagues, is that the laser-printed accession numbers on
the labels (inside the tubes) might eventually fall oﬀ
the paper. Fortunately, we’ve not yet seen this in any
samples going back 15 years or more. Some years ago,
we thought we saw problems with some types of dena-
turent use in commercial ethanol. Since

Typha samples
All,
I am working on a hybridization study with cattails,
genus Typha. So far, it looks as if our samples are all
hybrids (T.glauca). If any of you can help me obtain,
some pure strain samples of Typha lattifolia and Typha
angustifolia, I would greatly appreciate it.

have recently obtained their PhD in the ﬁeld of chem-
ical ecology. They are expected to have a strong back-
ground in general chemical ecology techniques and a
good knowledge of evolutionary biology. Familiarity
with behavioral ecology would be appreciated. Study
Context: Coevolution between gorse and its speciﬁc
weevils. In Brittany, there are three species of gorse
(Ulex, Fabaceae, Genisteae) which show a strong vari-
ation in ﬂowering and fruiting phenologies: U. minor
and U. gallii ﬂower in autumn and U. europaeus ﬂow-
ers mainly in the spring, but also in autumn and winter.
These gorse species can be found in sympatry. Speciﬁc
weevils named Apions (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) par-
asite the three Ulex species. The two main species are
Apion ulicis, already described in the literature, and
a new species discovered by our group. Apions ulicis
spends winter at an adult state and lay its eggs in the
spring. The new species lay eggs in autumn and spends
winter at a larvae state. However, this new species
never lay its eggs in autumnal pods of U. europaeus
and is restricted to U. minor and U. gallii. The two
Apion species present diﬀerent life cycles as well as dif-
ferent host choices. In this context, the applicant will
be working in collaboration with a PhD student who
compares cold resistance of the two Apion species, and
the diﬀerential attractiveness among three gorse species
to apions. Preliminary works already showed that the
two Apion species show diﬀerences in these two aspects.
Objectives: The person will be responsible of the iden-
tiﬁcation and comparison of the chemicals involved in
apions cold resistance and gorse chemical defense.
I- Chemical molecules involve in cold resistance of api-
ons: The objective is to understand the adaptation of
the weevils to the diﬀerent types of gorse ﬂowering and
fruiting phenology. The post-doc will have to com-
pare the compounds involved in cold resistance (glu-
cose, glycerol, glycogen) synthesized under cold tem-
peratures by the two Apion species.
II- Chemical defense of gorse: The objective is to un-
derstand the speciﬁcity of weevil choice for laying eggs.
The post-doc will have to (1) compare the composi-
tion of chemical molecules of defense in the three gorse
species and (2) determine what are the main chemi-
cal molecules that determine Apion choice. This will
be achieved by searching for principal bioactive sec-
ondary metabolites generally involved in the gorses de-
fense mechanisms: alkaloids and volatile compounds
(terpenes...). To apply: Please send a curriculum vi-
tae, including list of publications, research interests

Title: Epidemiology of endogenous retroviruses: the
transposable element tirant in D. simulans.
Research program: Transposable elements (TEs) repre-
sent a large portion of the genome of many organisms,
and the invasion of the genome of an entire species
can be a quick process. Although we have extensive
evidence that TEs can horizontally transfer into new
species, we do not know the extent to which recent new
invasions are due to the emergence of new aggressive
TE variants and, if so, how such new TE variants might
arise. We propose to study this question by analyzing
a particular retrotransposon, tirant, which is localized
on the chromosome arms in only a few African pop-
ulations of D. simulans, whereas D. melanoagster has
many copies scattered over the chromosomes in all pop-
ulations. The question arises on to why tirant has such
an unusual distribution. Is such a distribution reﬂec-
tive of a recent invasion of tirant in the African pop-
ulations, or is it a remnant in these populations of an
ancient more global invasion of the element into the D.
simulans / D. melanogaster ancestral species? Within
a large programme aimed at analyzing the copies of
tirant in the natural populations of Drosophila, we are
looking for an experienced molecular biologist to inves-
tigate viral particles and the gag, pol, and env proteins
of tirant. The objective is to test for a potential infec-
tious characteristics of this TE.
Applicant qualiﬁcations: The position is opened to all
nationalities. The candidate must have a strong back-
ground in molecular biology associated with retrovirol-
ogy and virus proteomics (western blot, tissues in situ
hybridization), with a high interest in population ge-

Description: Over the past three years, a multidisci-
plinary European research network has grown around
the archaeozoology lab of the Natural History Museum
in Paris. It aims to analyse the early husbandry of un-
gulates in the Old World. A better knowledge of these
phenomena will contribute to understand the histor-
ical, socio-economic and cognitive mechanisms of the
process of neolithisation on one hand, and to explain
the present day structure of the genetic diversity of do-
mestic animals on the other. The post-doc will con-
tribute to the paleogenetic research of this European
network, which aims to explore the diversity of wild
ancestors and to determine the geographic origin of do-
mestic Neolithic mammals. The work will be composed
of two parts: - sampling, extraction and ampliﬁcation
of ancient DNA from archaeological bone, following the
required protocols for reducing the risks of contamina-
tion and for authenticating the ampliﬁed ancient se-
quences; this part of the research will take place in
one of the genetic labs of the network (Lyon, Paris-
Jussieu, Grenoble, Dublin, Mayence); - acquiring suﬃ-
cient knowledge of archaeozoological and archaeological
techniques, practices and concepts, to be able to inter-
pret the palaeogenetic results in terms of history and
anthropology, and to contribute to their publication inpeer-reviewed journals; this will take place in the Muse-
ums archaeozoological lab in Paris. This post-doc aims
to help a young scientist, preferably with experience in
molecular biology but with or without experience in the
ﬁeld of ancient DNA, to increase her/his knowledge in
historical anthropology in order to be able to act as an
interface between the disciplines interested in paleoge-
netic techniques.
The applicant must hold a PhD in the ﬁeld of the
molecular biology, molecular phylogeny, molecular phy-
logeography, population genetics (animals or plants) or
ancient DNA. He/she should have experience with an-
cient DNA or with similar substrates in small quanti-
ties. The candidate must take an interest in interdisci-
plinary approaches, in the application of phylogenetics
to the history of human beings and their societies. Ba-
sic knowledge of Holocene prehistory would be an asset.
He/she will have contact with other scientists involved
in the research, and must be able to work in a team.
The ability to read and speak English is required.

DESCRIPTION: Postdoctoral Position in Population
Genetics. The Evolutionary Biology unit of the Cor-
nell Laboratory of Ornithology seeks to ﬁll the position
of Postdoctoral Associate within the framework of an
NSF-funded project “Unifying Models of Gene Flow at
Multiple Scales in a Well-Studied Vertebrate.” This
project will generate a comprehensive understanding of
dispersal in the threatened Florida Scrub-Jay by com-
paring robust ﬁeld, model-based, and genetic patterns
of gene ﬂow. A large fraction of the world population of
these jays is currently being screened with large pan-
els of microsatellite and SNP markers; extensive ﬁeld
data regarding the distribution and dispersal of this
species are available. The postdoctoral associate will
work in collaboration with Cornell faculty Irby Lovette,
Rasmus Nielsen, and John Fitzpatrick to develop and
carry out population genetic analyses appropriate to
this large dataset, including deriving estimators of gene-
ﬂow from spatial genetic models appropriate for the
Florida Scrub-Jay system and applying these methods
to test hypotheses regarding dispersal patterns. Al-

An INRA postdoctoral fellowship position is avail-
able at UAGPF INRA Orl´ eans and UMRGV
[1]www.evry.inra.fr . This position is available for one
year from May 2005.
The project consists in cloning a major factor control-
ling partial resistance to Melampsora larici populina
(Mlp) leaf rust in Populus trichocarpa. The foliar rust
caused by Melampsora larici-populina Kleb. is the main
disease aﬀecting poplar stands in the northern part of
France - more generally in Northern Europe. A major
factor controlling partial resistance was fully charac-
terize by genetic studies conducted on several P. tri-
chocarpa x P. trichocarpa and P. deltoides x P. tri-chocarpa families with seven strains of Mlp (Dowkiw
and Bastien, 2004; Jorge et al. 2005). A BAC library of
the P. trichocarpa parent is underway. A 14 equivalent
genome is expected at the end of March 2005. High res-
olution mapping of the region of interest is applied on
one segregant family of 1200 progenies. Physical map
will be established by using markers tightly linked to
the target locus. The project will be enhanced by com-
parison with the overall genome sequence of Nisqually
already available.
Major duties will include high-density and high -
resolution mapping of targeted region, BAC character-
ization and ﬁngerprinting, sequence analysis, marker
development, genetic and physical mapping, contig as-
sembly. Plant material of more than 500 individuals
in P. trichocarpa, P. nigra and P. deltoides species are
already phenotyped for rust resistance as a ﬁrst step of
association studies.
Applicants should have a PhD in agricultural sciences
or biology with proven expertise in molecular genetics.
Experience on informatic tools for sequence analysis
would be advantageous. Knowledge of French language
is not required.
The candidate is supposed to have never worked in
France up to now. Candidates should provide a cover

“Probabilistic and mixture models in phylogenetics”
Project
The exponential increase in the number of sequences
(DNA, RNA, and proteins) available makes now possi-
ble to build and infer complex and realistic models of
sequence evolution. The standard models are Marko-
vian and describe the substitution probabilities from
one character (nucleotide, amino acid, or codon) to an-
other. However, it was recently proposed [1] to build
more powerful models via the use of mixtures of Marko-
vian models. The mixture approach has shown to beApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 61
eﬀective in numerous domains (e.g. pattern recogni-
tion and classiﬁcation) and its application to evolution-
ary studies and phylogenetics is quite promising. The
postdoc subject is to explore this new approach at the
statistical and/or algorithmic level, within the maxi-
mum likelihood framework and the PHYML software
[2].

AvianDemography
The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW)
focuses on fundamental, strategic research into indi-
vidual organisms, populations, ecological communities
and ecosystems. More than 240 staﬀ are employed atthree centres as well as the head oﬃce. The Centre for
Limnology (CL) in Nieuwersluis focuses its research on
freshwater ecology. The Centre for Estuarine and Ma-
rine Ecology (CEME) in Yerseke deals with ecosytems
in brackish and salt water and the emphasis at the Cen-
tre for Terrestrial Ecology (CTE) in Heteren is put on
land-based ecology. The Netherlands Institute of Ecol-
ogy is a research institute of the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW)
The Department of Animal Population Biology is look-
ing for a:
Post-doc Ecologist (m/f) (reference number CTE-
PVD-05091)
for a project on spatial aspects of avian demographic
processes. This project is a joint project of the depart-
ments Spatial Ecology (CEME), Plant Animal Interac-
tions (CL) and Animal Population Biology (CTE) and
within the project a twinned position at Plant Animal
Interactions has been ﬁlled.
Function description The Post-doc will apply and de-
velop approaches for spatially explicit analyses of avian
demographic processes. The aim of the analyses is to
improve insight in dispersal and its consequences for de-
mography, using large sets of data on ringing, resight-
ing, reproduction, survival, feeding and other charac-
teristics of birds. Two large datasets are already avail-
able at the institute. One of these datasets covers dis-
tribution patterns of Bewick’s Swans, which move from
the North to the South of the Netherlands in the course
of the winter, using resightings of individually marked
birds. Actual movement patterns will be compared to
predictions from optimality models. Furthermore, the
post-doc will analyse dispersal patterns using a large
12-year dataset on reproduction and survival of Swal-
lows at seven sites in the Netherlands. The aim is to
determine how dispersal aﬀects the spatial structure of
populations, especially how diﬀerences in dispersal are
related to habitat properties. The Swallow data set
oﬀers good possibilities to study variation in dispersal
among habitats and any interactions with sex and date
of birth. The Swallow data have been collected by vol-
unteers linked to the Dutch Ringing Centre, which is
part of Animal Population Biology. Finally, the post-
doc is encouraged to collaborate with other members
of Animal Population Biology on spatial aspects of the
Animal Population Biology research.
Function requirements The candidate should possess a
PhD in Ecology, a strong background in quantitative
approaches and statistics. Knowledge of GIS and/or of
multi-strata survival analysis is desired. The candidate
should have good verbal and writing skills.62 EvolDir April 1, 2005
Conditions of employment The appointment will be for
1.5 years starting on the 1st June 2005 at CTE Het-
eren and will be in accordance to the CAO-NU of the
KNAW. The gross monthly salary will be maximum
3.453, – depending on experience.

RochesterU EvolGeneticsNasonia
Postoctoral Position: Evolutionary Genetics in Nasonia
Description: A 2-3 year postdoctoral position is
available to study evolutionary genetics in the par-
asitoid wasp genus Nasonia. Nasonia is an emerg-
ing model system for genetic research, which has re-
cently been selected for full genome sequencing ( http:/-
/www.genome.gov/13014443 ). Genome sequencing has
been approved by NIH for 6-fold sequencing of N.
vitripennis and 1-fold sequencing of the two sibling
species, N. giraulti and N.longicornis. Nasonia is a com-
plex of three closely related species that are interfertile,
allowing movement of genes between them. The three
species diﬀer in many interesting aspects of morphol-
ogy and behavior. An NIH-funded project investigates
the genetic basis of a 2.5 fold diﬀerence in male wing-
size between two species(N. vitripennis and N. giraulti).
This represents a recent evolution of male- and organ-
speciﬁc regulation of cell size and number, and our ge-netic analyses indicates that the diﬀerence is due pri-
marily to 3-4 genetic regions of large eﬀect. Fine-scale
mapping and introgression of wing size genes from one
species into the other has been accomplished. The goal
of this project is to use positional cloning methods to
identify candidate genes involved, and to investigate
their patterns of molecular evolution, and gene expres-
sion in wing imaginal discs. Depending upon interest,
the postdoctoral researcher will also have opportuni-
ties to become involved in aspects of the Nasonia EST
project (70,000 ESTs are currently being sequenced in
the two species), Nasonia microarry, and molecular evo-
lutionary studies emerging from the Nasonia genome
project.
Additional information on Nasonia and related projects
can be obtained through my website below
Requirements: PhD. Experience with some combina-
tion of the following: insect genetics, DNA sequencing
and analysis, molecular evolution, QT-PCR, cDNA mi-
croarrays, BAC library hybridization
Salary: $33,500 38,500 per year, depending upon
experience level. Health Insurance is also included.
Rochester has a moderate cost of living with readily
available and aﬀordable housing.
Deadline: The position is available immediately. Ap-
plications will be accepted until the position is ﬁlled.

Title: Linking Genomes to Ecology: Evolution of
Daphnia Immune System Genes
Supervisors: Tom Little (tom.little@ed.ac.uk) and
Mark Blaxter (mark.blaxter@ed.ac.uk). This NERC-
funded project is focused on disease resistance and im-
munity genes in Daphnia, the ﬁrst crustacean to have
its genome fully sequenced. Depending on your interest
or skill, the work may emphasize aspects of compara-
tive genomics, molecular evolution, or the ecology and
evolution of disease resistance, but preferably the can-
didate will have an interest in all these things.
Details: 1) Postdoctoral Research Fellow (quote ref:
3004165)
BRIEF BACKGROUND AND GOALS OF THE
PROJECT: Parasitism may dramatically modulate the
genetic structure of populations. Natural populations
vary tremendously in their levels of parasitism and
pathogen virulence, and although host genetic polymor-
phism often mediates these patterns, rarely is it known
which genes are involved. Addressing this issue requires
studying parasitism in a organism that is both a ge-
netic model and a model for studies of natural variation.
This Project will exploit emerging genomic knowledge
of Daphnia pulex. Daphnia, unlike traditional models
for genetic study, are extremely well-characterised in
terms of their ecology and natural patterns of variation,
which includes intriguing variation in levels of recom-
bination. The project will ﬁrst involve searching the
Daphnia genome for immunity genes (based on homol-
ogy with the range of other sequenced arthropods) to
gain a broad perspective on the immune-related genome
of the ﬁrst sequenced crustacean (sensu Christophides
et al. Science 298:159-165 (2002)). Second, the project
will study natural levels of variation at candidate im-
munity genes. In particular, we aim to determine which
immune system genes are the foci of coevolutionary in-teractions by examining DNA polymorphism between
and within species to test for the footprint of pathogen-
mediated selection in natural populations (e.g. Ford,
M. J. Molecular Ecology 11, 1245-1262 (2002); Little et
al. Journal of Molecular Evolution 59:498-506 (2004)).
Thus, this Project will combine bioinformatics, popu-
lation genetics and evolutionary ecology, possibly in-
cluding ﬁeld work. The candidate will have a strong
interest in some or all of these areas. The Job is based
in Edinburgh, but travel to North American study sites
is likely. The candidate will join a working environment
that is extremely strong in evolutionary ecology, pop-
ulation genetics, genomics and coevolutionary interac-
tions (see: http://www.icapb.ed.ac.uk/ )

Postdoctoral Researcher

Genetic variation in Drosophila immune responses
Individuals and populations of Drosophila
melanogaster vary considerably in their suscepti-
bility to infection and parasitism. This project will
begin by examining the genetic architecture of this
variation; the numbers of loci, the size of their eﬀects,
epistatic interactions and whether genes are speciﬁc
to certain parasite genotypes. We will then attempt
to identify the genes themselves. This will not only
allow population genetic analyses of the processes
maintaining so much genetic variation, but it also
provides a novel approach for identifying ’immunity
genes’ in Drosophila.
The project will take a stepwise approach. Initially,
we will use recombinant lines to identify regions of the
genome containing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) af-
fecting immune competence. Then, we will reﬁne the
location of these QTLs by deﬁciency mapping. Finally,
we will identify genes by complementation tests and
association mapping.
The lab is working on both speciﬁc parasites of
Drosophila (parasitoids and the sigma virus) and gen-
eral insect pathogens (bacteria and fungi). You will
work in the lab of Dr Frank Jiggins, and collaborate
with Dr Sara Knott on the quantitative genetic aspects
of the project. There are two graduate students and a
technician working on closely related projects.
Candidates: Will have a PhD in an appropriate disci-
pline and must have experience relevant to the project,
preferably in host-parasite coevolution, insect immu-
nity, Drosophila biology or quantitative genetics.

UManchester Imprinting
We are looking to appoint a Postdoctoral Research As-
sociate as part of a project funded by a Biotechnol-
ogy and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)
project grant for three years. You will investigate the
contribution of genomic imprinting and maternal eﬀects
to the genetic architecture of size and growth related
traits in mice. The project will utilise a very large set
of genotypic and phenotypic data available from multi-
ple generations of an experimental population of mice,
providing a very powerful means to address a number
of questions related to non-Mendelian eﬀects in genetic
architecture. The project also provides signiﬁcant ﬂex-
ibility to examine a number of other related questions
about the structure and evolution of genetic architec-
ture and its consequences for multivariate evolution.
Research will be done in collaboration with Professor
James Cheverud (Washington University in St Louis).
You should have a strong interest in genetics and quan-
titative analysis and will possess a PhD degree in a
relevant biological discipline. Quantitative and com-
puting skills are essential as is the ability to work both
independently and collaboratively as part of a research
team. Some skills or an interest in obtaining skills in
theoretical population or quantitative genetics is pre-
ferred but not required. You will have good interper-
sonal and communication skills and preferably experi-
ence in quantitative genetics, population genetics, ge-nomics, or multivariate statistics.
The appointment is for a period of one year in the ﬁrst
instance and, upon successful completion of this proba-
tionary period, is available for a further two years. (i.e.,
this is a THREE YEAR position, but the ﬁrst year is
necessarily considered probationary as per University
policy). The start date for this position is ﬂexible and
subject to negotiation, but ideally the position would
start on or before September 1st 2005.

UMaryland StalkEyedFlies
POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT
Description: This is a two-year (minimum) postdoc-
toral position to participate in an NSF-funded project
on genomic analysis of sexual dimorphism in stalk-eyed
ﬂies.
The goal of the research is to identify variation in gene
expression and DNA sequence that is associated with
morphological innovation and rapid diversiﬁcation in
head shape of stalk-eyed ﬂies. These ﬂies have under-
gone, to varying degrees, elongation of the head into
stalks as a consequence of sexual selection. The pri-
mary strategy of the project will be to identify candi-
date loci involved in sexually dimorphic developmentApril 1, 2005 EvolDir 69
of eye-stalks and then quantify molecular variation at
these genes. Candidate loci will be chosen based on
an analysis of diﬀerential gene expression in the eye-
antennal imaginal discs of these ﬂies. Diﬀerential gene
expression will be identiﬁed using an EST database of
over 2500 unique cDNA clones and microarray analy-
sis to reveal quantitative diﬀerences in gene expression
between two speciesCyrtodiopsis dalmanni and Cyrto-
diopsis quinqueguttatathat diﬀer in the degree of sex-
ual dimorphism. Both male and female gene expres-
sion in eye-antennal imaginal discs will be examined in
the microarray experiments. The person in this posi-
tion will have primary responsibility for conducting the
microarray experiments using a well-staﬀed microar-
ray facility ( http://www.umbi.umd.edu/˜cbr/macore/-
macorestart.htm ).
In collaboration with colleagues at the Joint Genome
Institute, genomic libraries constructed for both species
will then be screened to obtain both protein coding
and ﬂanking sequence data for several candidate loci.
Comparison of sequence variation within one of these
species, C. dalmanni, will be used to provide SNPs that
can be included as molecular markers to determine if
putative candidate genes map to previously identiﬁed
QTL sites. Analyses of molecular variation will be used
to test whether candidate genes or gene regions exhibit
1) association with phenotypic variation in eye-stalk
size, 2) signatures of directional or stabilizing selection
and 3) altered levels of genetic diversity.
The successful applicant will join an active lab with six
graduate students, research technician, and several un-
dergraduates involved in research and will be able to
participate in campus initiatives involving genomics.
Requirements: PhD in the biological sciences. Experi-
ence with spotted cDNA microarrays, DNA sequencing,
SNP genotyping, and QTL analysis is desirable.
Salary: $35,000 per year
Health Insurance: Up to $4000 supplement available.
Deadline: The position is available now. Applications
will be accepted until the position is ﬁlled.

THEME AND SCOPE: Large-scale genome sequenc-
ing projects are generating vast amounts of data for a
multitude of organisms including mammals and other
vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants, bacteria, and
viruses. As the data increase so do the opportunities
and the challenges for scientists to interpret them. By
endeavouring to make sense of the process and pattern
of genome evolution, comparative genomics lies at the
forefront of this challenge.
The core of comparative genome analysis is the estab-
lishment of the correspondence between genes (orthol-
ogy analysis) or other genomic features in diﬀerent or-
ganisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it
possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible
for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evo-
lutionary events acting at various organizational levels
shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mu-
tations aﬀect individual nucleotides. At a higher level,
large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lat-eral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and in-
sertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in pro-
cesses of hybridization, polyploidization and endosym-
biosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complex-
ity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges
to developers of mathematical models and algorithms,
who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, sta-
tistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from ex-
act, heuristic, ﬁxed parameter and approximation al-
gorithms for problems based on parsimony models to
Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms for Bayesian
analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.
The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Ge-
nomics is a forum on all aspects and components of this
ﬁeld, ranging from new quantitative discoveries about
genome structure and process to theorems on the com-
plexity of computational problems inspired by genome
comparison.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.76 EvolDir April 1, 2005
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
