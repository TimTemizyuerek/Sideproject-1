2SUU-V5PW-DA6U86R3F7/cr.aspx Recent observa-
tions strongly suggest that changes in maternal stress
signalling can lead to altered development in ospring
and changes in ospring physiology across evolutionary
lineages. In mammals, studies suggest that maternal
exposure to environmental stress during pregnancy can
lead to an increased risk of a variety of pathologies
in later life including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
depression and anxiety.
This new conference will bring together scientists work-
ing on foetal programming and developmental origins
of health and disease in humans and animals, with
ecologists and evolutionary biologists, to compare and
contrast mechanisms of intergenerational change in di-
verse organisms, to help us understand how the maternal
environment contributes to developmental programming
and disease susceptibility.

limited number of bursaries are available for PhD stu-
dents to attend the meeting.

Dear Colleagues,
This is a second announcement for the ProbGen'2019
meeting. The deadline for early bird registration and
for student/postdoc grant application is May 25.
We are pleased to announce the 5th Probabilistic Mod-
eling in Genomics meeting (ProbGen19), to be held in
Aussois, in the French Alps, Oct 6-9, 2019 (https://-
probgen2019.sciencesconf.org/).
The goal of this meeting is to cover a wide variety of
topics in genomics, ranging from population genomics to
systems biology and cancer genomics, with a particular
focus on the use of novel mathematical and computa-
tional models and inference methods to address timely
and important biological questions. What makes the
meeting special, in our view, is that it has substan-
tial mathematical and theoretical depth yet remains
well grounded in the practical and scientic concerns of
modern genomics. We invite abstract submissions on a
range of topics including functional genomics, molecu-
lar evolution, phylogenetics, epidemiology, methods for
genome-wide association studies, quantitative genetics,6 EvolDir June 1, 2019
etc'
We will have three keynote speakers: Barbara Engel-
hardt (Princeton University) Gil McVean (Big Data
Institute, University of Oxford) Caroline Colijn (Simon
Fraser University, Vancouver)
Alongside invited speakers, oral presentations will be
selected from submitted abstracts. We particularly en-
courage abstract submissions from junior investigators,
including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. A
few grants will be available for students and postdocs.
Best wishes and hope to see some of you at the meeting,

I wanted to let you know that the Royal Society is
holding a Theo Murphy meeting, Pearls of wisdom: syn-
ergising leadership and expertise in molluscan genomics,
from 16 - 17 September 2019. The meeting is a 2-day
event, held at Chicheley Hall, Buckinghamshire, and
has a poster session for increased networking.June 1, 2019 EvolDir 9
Although molluscs are ecologically, economically, and
medically important, progress in understanding their
biology has been limited by problems associated with
genome sequencing and assembly. As technology break-
throughs overcome these challenges, this meeting will
bring together experts in molluscan biology and ge-
nomics to share best practice in how to use these de-
velopments in elucidating the biology of this diverse
and ill-understood phylum. More information on the
speakers and programme is available on the website
<https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/-

2 PHD positions on the behaviour ecology of shorebirds
in Madagascar
1) Behavioural ecology meets disease biology and
immuno-ecology 2) The scent of Madagascar plovers:
communication or concealment?
2 PhD positions (3 years), Bielefeld University (Ger-
many), Universities of Bath and Bristol (UK)
Supervisors: 1) Prof Oliver Kruger, Prof Tam as Szekely
and 2) Dr Barbara Caspers, Prof Innes Cuthill
Mating systems and parental behaviour are among the
most diverse social behaviours, and recent research sug-
gests that the social environment inuences these be-
haviours. Small plovers (Charadrius spp.) exhibit highly
variable breeding systems, between and within species,
making them an ideal model system for studying the
causes and consequences of sex ratio variation. The
objective of these studentships is to investigate these
fundamental issues by means of eldwork in three plover
populations in Madagascar. The research builds on the
results from previous successful studentships working
with these birds.
We seek two bright and highly motivated students with
strong interests in evolutionary ecology and behavioural
ecology. Willingness to carry out eldwork in a harsh
tropical environment is essential for this position. The
students will search for nests, trap birds and take blood
and preen gland samples and record their behaviour. In
addition, they will use molecular methods and chemical
analysis in the laboratory. Previous experience with
avian eld biology or any other eld experience in the
tropics is very important.
Fieldwork will be in a remote and pristine location in
SW Madagascar. Facilities are extremely basic, the
weather can be very harsh, and a great deal of walking
and cycling are required. Opportunities for outside com-
municate on are very limited. You must be physically
t, hard-working and meticulous, and have a proven
ability to work independently. You must have a positive
attitude and an ability to look after yourself (i.e. cook
your own meals, deal with logistics and organise your
own work over extended periods). Speaking French or
Malagasy is advantageous, but not a requirement.June 1, 2019 EvolDir 19
Project 1. Behavioural ecology meets disease biology
and immuno-ecology. Supervisors: Oliver Kruger, Joe
Homan, Nayden Chakarov, Tam as Sz ekely. The aim
of this project is to study the immune-ecological causes
of sex ratio bias in three sympatric species of plovers
with varying mating systems at one site in Madagascar.
At which stage of the life cycle do mortality dierences
between the sexes emerge and what are the demographic
consequences of these dierences? We aim to experimen-
tally manipulate parasite infection and load in plovers
but also monitor the populations closely to nd the
proximate causes of the adult sex ratio biases previously
described. In addition, the student will test hypotheses
of mating system evolution, and develop demographic
models to estimate key demographic properties of natu-
ral populations., statistical modelling and/or immuno-
logical techniques is advantageous. Strong quantitative
skills are essential, and willingness to programme is a
must.
Project 2. The scent of Madagascar plovers: communi-
cation or concealment? Supervisors: Barbara Caspers,
Innes Cuthill, Tam as Sz ekely. The aim of this project is
to investigate the function of preen gland secretion vari-
ation in three sympatric species of plovers with varying
mating systems at one site in Madagascar. Within the
last decades various hypothesis have emerged, which
will be tested using this unique study system. Using
state of the art chemical analysis techniques together
with behavioural experiments and molecular techniques
we will investigate whether plovers change their preen
gland composition to protect themselves, their chicks or
eggs against microbes, or olfactory hunting predators,
or in order to communicate with conspecics.
These projects will provide cutting edge training in evolu-
tionary biology, behavioural ecology and disease biology.
In addition, the student will be involved in biodiversity
conservation impact of the projects by working with
local conservationists and training Malagasy students
in eld biology and conservation.
The students will be based at the Department of
Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University (www.uni-
bielefeld.de/biologie/animalbehaviour.html). The De-
partment is the oldest of its kind in Germany and cur-
rently hosts 6 Principal Investigators, 7 Postdocs and
20 PhD students. It oers a stimulating international
environment and an excellent research infrastructure
with access to state-of-the-art techniques. The work-
ing language of the Department is English. The stu-
dents will also spend some of their time at the Universi-
ties of Bath (www.bath.ac.uk/bio-sci/biodiversity-lab/-
index.htm) and Bristol

Adaptive radiation of cichlid sh in rivers: Evolutionary
genomics of replicated diversication in Neotropical pike
cichlids
PhD position at the University of South Bohemia in
Ceske Budejovice (Budweis, Czech Republic) available
from: July 2019 (negotiable) application deadline: May
31st
More information: https://zoo.prf.jcu.cz/wp-content/-
uploads/2019/05/PhD-position-at-USB-Adaptive-
radiation-of-cichlid-sh-in-rivers.pdf Project back-
ground: Adaptive radiations are often too rapid for the
emergence of new relevant mutations between successive
speciation events and are thus more likely to utilise
standing genetic variation. Hybridization between
species can instantaneously boost genetic diversity and
create novel phenotypes, and thus facilitate speciation
and adaptive radiation. On the other hand, the question
whether interspecic hybridization is important as
a mechanism that generates biological diversity is
a matter of some controversy due to the argument
that reduced tness would typically render hybrids an
evolutionary dead end.
The model system: Our research group has recently
discovered and introduced an outstanding evolutionary
model of replicated diversication that includes two in-
dependent riverine lineages of a South American cichlid
genus, Crenicichla, inhabiting adjacent river basins (of
the La Plata River) with similar geomorphology. Both
clades show an extremely wide range of morphologies
and coloration patterns tied closely with trophic ecology,
in which the corresponding (and strikingly similar) eco-
morphs from dierent basins have evolved independently.
We have recently demonstrated, based on morphological
tests of similarities, ancestral states and rates of evo-
lution that the replicated ecomorphs arose via parallel
processes of phenotypic and trophic diversication.
Goal of the project: The aim of this project is to bring
new resolution into the study of microevolutionary pro-
cesses of diversication based on whole-genome sequenc-
ing and RAD-seq genotyping. Phylogenomic and mor-20 EvolDir June 1, 2019
phological analyses will be used to better understand the
biological and environmental factors underlying rapid
speciation with special focus on the role of hybridization.
To achieve full employment of the WGS/RAD data we
will also sequence and assemble a reference genome of
an appropriate congeneric species.
Research team: The student will work in a small team
supervised by Lubomir Pialek and Oldrich Rican. The
project will be conducted in close collaboration with
Jorge Casciotta and Adriana Almirn (National Univer-
sity of La Plata, Argentina), Edward Burress (University
of California, USA), and Milan Malinsky (University of
Basel, Switzerland).
Time and place: The PhD position is available for three
years, starting in July 2019 (starting date negotiable)
at the Dept. of Zoology, Faculty of Science, University
of South Bohemia, Czech Republic.
Applicant's desired qualication: Master's degree in bi-
ological sciences Understanding of the basic principles
of population genetics and molecular evolution

CharlesU PlantSpeciation
An interdisciplinary PhD project is available under the
joint supervision of the Plant Repro Evo Lab (http://-
plantreproevo.natur.cuni.cz) and Machac Lab (https:/-
/machac.weebly.com) at Charles University & Czech
Academy of Sciences in Prague.
How sexual selection generates new species remains
among the fundamental puzzles in evolution. Classic
theory postulates that sexual selection produces diver-
gence in sexual traits which, eventually, translates into
reproductive barriers and large-scale speciation. Plants
present excellent opportunities to test and extend the
theory, given that sexual selection has been studied ex-
tensively at the gametic level in plants (competition
between male pollen grains and female choice mediated
by the ower stigmas and ovules). However, the genomicbasis of sexual selection and its large-scale inuence on
plant speciation have yet to be examined.
The PhD project will bridge these gaps in current knowl-
edge by integrating research from micro- and macroevo-
lution. The microevolutionary research will involve
developmental biology, transcriptomics and population
genomics. Specically, the student will evaluate genetic
and phenotypic dierentiation in sexual traits across
several *Arabidopsis* species*, *using laboratory tech-
niques. The macroevolutionary research will examine
whether sexual traits (oral traits, pollination mode,
etc.) translate into large-scale speciation in plants, us-
ing statistical techniques. By bridging two traditions in
evolutionary research (micro- and macro-), the project
will produce an integrative perspective on sexual selec-
tion and speciation. In the process, it will equip the
PhD student with theoretical and practical skills cur-
rently in high demand in academia and private sector
(plant reproduction biology, genomic techniques, statis-
tics, programming).
We are looking for PhD student with interest in multi-
disciplinary approaches, involving plant reproduction,
genomics, and macroevolution. Previous experience in
any of these elds is not required but will be benecial.
The project is supported jointly by the Department of
Botany and the Center for Theoretical Studies (Charles
University, Prague, Czech Republic) and combines the
expertise from two related elds, under the supervision
of Clment Lafon Placette (plant reproduction biology,
genomics; http://plantreproevo.natur.cuni.cz) and An-
tonin Machac (macroevolution, macroecology; https://-
machac.weebly.com/).
The project is expected to start on October 1, 2019. It
will be nanced for four years. The salary together with
the doctoral stipend provided by the university (start-
ingO 800 EUR, with signicant raise over the years) is
equivalent to the average salary within Prague, which
represents currently one of the most vibrant cities in Eu-
rope, with rich social life, large international community,
and opportunities for collaborative research across multi-
ple institutes and universities located in the city. If you
are interested, please send us an email explaining your
motivations and your CV at lafonplc@natur.cuni.cz.

BirdEvolutionClimateChange
I am looking for an enthusiastic and motivated student
to take up a PhD scholarship at Deakin University in
Melbourne, Australia, as part of a project called 'Shape-
Shifting Birds'.
The goal of this Australian Research Council-funded
Project is to determine whether changes in body shape
are an evolutionary response to climate change. Birds
in warmer climates tend to have large extremities (bills
and legs), increasing their surface area and enabling loss
of excess heat. Increases in extremity size may therefore
be a predicted consequence of climatic warming. The
student will undertake an extensive comparative analy-
sis of Australian birds, designed to identify a) which bird
species are showing changes in body shape (bill and leg22 EvolDir June 1, 2019
morphology); b) what ecological (life-history, behaviour,
habitat) factors determine such responses; c) whether
these changes relate to tness/survival and d) whether
such changes are linked to long-term populations trends
in Australian birds.
The project will involve extensive work in Australian mu-
seum collections, measuring bird morphology using tra-
ditional and modern (3D-scanning) techniques. There
is also a strong analytical component, involving use
of long-term eld data on Australian bird species as
well as phylogenetic comparative analysis of large-scale
ecological data sets for Australian birds.
Applicants must enrol full time and hold an Honours
degree (First Class) or an equivalent standard Master's
degree with a substantial research component. Appli-
cants will have good English-writing skills and preferably
have experience with handling large data sets and appro-
priate techniques for analysing them (e.g. phylogenetic
comparative analysis, linear models, model selection).
Experience with R would be advantageous. Previous
experience of either of working with museum specimens,
or research experience with birds is desirable but not
essential. PhD students receive a stipend of AU $27,596
per annum tax exempt (2019 rate) plus a tuition fee
waiver. A relocation allowance from $500 to $1,500
(for single to family) is awarded to students who are
moving from interstate or overseas in order to study at
Deakin. For international students only: you will also
receive health coverage for the duration of the tuition
fees oset (Duration is 3 years for stipend and 4 years
for the tuition fees oset). Application letters (or in-
quiries) should sent, together with a CV to Dr Matthew
Symonds (matthew.symonds@deakin.edu.au). Closing
date for applications is 7th June 2019.

APPLY FOR A PHD POSITION IN AN INTERNA-
TIONAL PROJECT!
*Pollution and cancer in aquatic environment*
We invite candidates to apply for a PhD student position
in an international research project focusing on pollu-tion and cancer in aquatic environment. The applicant
can have a background in either Evolutionary biology,
marine biology, genetics, veterinary science or zoology.
The project will involve eld work on the Baltic Sea,
laboratory analyses, work with captive sh, and many
opportunities for international collaboration and travel.
The PhD position will be host by the Estonian Marine
Institute, but with tight collaboration with the Zoology
Department at the University of Tartu. Main work will
be conducted in Tartu, some work will also take place
in Montpellier, France.
For more information and applying, please contact Tuul
Sepp (tuul.sepp@gmail.com) and Mathieu Giraudeau
(giraudeau.mathieu@gmail.com).
*Deadline for applying is June 1st.*
*Title of the project: *Natural adaptations to onco-
genic aquatic environments: a study of contemporary
evolution in Baltic Sea, using ounders and their cell
lines
*Supervisors*: dr. Tuul Sepp (Department of Zoology,
University of Tartu), dr. Lauri Saks (Marine Institute,
University of Tartu), dr. Mathieu Giraudeau (CNRS;
France)
*Description of the project: *All multicellular organ-
isms have developed mechanisms to supress malignant
processes. Our knowledge of these natural defence mech-
anisms against cancer is so far limited. A better under-
standing of adaptations to avoid cancer is crucial for
building our understanding of evolution of cancer and
nding novel possibilities for the treatment of cancer.
Human activities have resulted in large-scale environ-
mental modications. This unintentionally creates pos-
sibilities for using polluted environments as \natural
laboratories" for studying the evolution of cancer de-
fence mechanisms. While it is known that organisms
that are naturally exposed to environmental pollutants
can evolve specic adaptations to cope with pollutants
and their adverse eects on tness, almost no attention
has been focused on contemporary natural adaptations
to environmental oncogenic factors.
*Hypothesis*: In polluted habitats, local adaptation
have developed in ounders to overcome the negative
physiological eects of environmental oncogenic factors.
*Methods*: Baltic Sea is one of the most polluted ma-
rine areas in the world. Pollutant levels vary between
localities, creating a gradient of more and less polluted
habitats. Previous studies have indicated that cancerous
lesions are common in ounders (*Platichthys esus*)
living in the Baltic Sea. Flounder is the main target
species for monitoring health eects of contamination inJune 1, 2019 EvolDir 23
North Sea and Baltic Sea since the species is abundant,
benthic, and inhabits shallow waters.
Stage 1. We will start with an assessment of the preva-
lence of tumors in ounders from 10-15 Baltic Sea lo-
calities diering in pollutant levels. We will conduct
histological analyses for conrming cancers. We will
assess cellular defence mechanisms against pollution
along the gradient of polluted local habitats, using tis-
sue samples collected from the eld (immune defences,
antioxidant defences and DNA damage).
Stage 2. Based on the data collected from the rst stage
of the project, we will conduct a captive study with
ounders originating from dierently polluted habitats
to assess the plasticity and genetic background of in-
vestment in antioxidant and anti-tumor mechanisms in
a common garden environment.
Stage 3. We will develop cell lines from wild sh to
assess the eects of various environmental oncogenic
factors on cell functioning and defence mechanisms on
the level of gene expression.

EstonianU PikeGeneticsParasites
PhD position on northern pike genetics and parasites
A 4-year Ph.D. position is available focusing on popula-
tion genetics and parasite fauna in northern pike (Esox
lucius) at Estonian University of Life Sciences (Chair
of Aquaculture) under the supervision of Prof. Anti
Vasem agi and Dr. Veljo Kisand. More specically, the
project aims to i) develop and test the performance of
DNA-based approaches for estimation of pike abundance
and recruitment success in coastal Baltic Sea; ii) charac-
terize inter- and intra-specic parasite diversity in pike
using next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches.
This PhD project is a component of a larger project
examining the alternative molecular genetic methods
to estimate northern pike abundance (e.g. using envi-
ronmental DNA and mark-recapture for quantication
of biomass/abundance, sib-ship analysis for estimating
eective number of breeders) and characterize parasite
fauna (NGS for characterization of the trematode species
in the family Diplostomidae). The PhD student will
work with other PhD students focused on eDNA and
mark-recapture analysis of pike.
Declining trends in the abundance of many sh speciesillustrate the urgent need to implement more informa-
tive monitoring programs and improve the eciency
of ongoing management and conservation actions. The
northern pike (Esox lucius) is one of few abundant preda-
tory sh species in Baltic Sea coastal areas. Declines of
pike populations have been related to trophic cascades
(an increase of mesopredators) and eutrophication symp-
toms. In addition, pike is a much-appreciated target for
growing recreational and small-scale coastal commer-
cial sheries and thus has a signicant socio-economical
value. Over the last decades, severe local declines of
Baltic pike have been reported, and although pike is not
regarded as threatened in the Baltic Sea, there is still
reason for conservation concern for many populations.
The PhD will join research groups of Vasem agi at the
Chair of Aquaculture (Estonian University of Life Sci-
ences) and Kisand at Institute of Technology (University
of Tartu). The molecular work is jointly carried out in
the labs of Riho Gross (https://www.researchgate.net/-
lab/Riho-Gross-Lab) and Veljo Kisand (https://-
www.tuit.ut.ee/en/research/veljo-kisand).
Duties: You will be part of our teams working with

carry out eld-work, laboratory work, bioinformatics,
and population genetic analyses. The principal respon-
sibilities include phenotyping, sample collection, DNA
extraction, microsatellite analysis, estimation of the ef-
fective number of breeders, NGS library preparation,
analyses of NGS data, analysis of inter-and intraspecic
diversity of parasites, writing manuscripts and keeping
detailed notes and logs of the analyses.
Qualications: The qualication requirement is the com-
pletion of a master's degree. Candidates should have a
strong background and interest in ecology, population
genetics and evolution, and motivation for highly collab-

a strong background in next-generation sequencing data
analysis and/or host-parasite interactions. Previous ex-
perience working with sh would be useful but is not
required. The starting date for this position is Sept-
Oct 2019. Excellent communication skills in both oral
and written English are expected. Candidates should
be able to work both independently and as part of a
collaborative team.
Place of work: Tartu, Estonia. Form of employment:

ETH Zurich FungalPopGenetics
Title: Global population genetics of Cercospora beticola,
cause of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beets
Summary: Cercospora beticola causes the most impor-
tant fungal disease on sugar beets worldwide. A global
collection of ~1000 strains of C. beticola will be assayed
for 20 SSR markers. Population genetic analyses of these
neutral loci will be used to elucidate global population
structure and infer eective population size, reproduc-
tive mode, and extent of gene ow. 150 of the strains
will be used to conduct an FST/QST analysis to de-
termine the importance of local adaptation in selected
populations. Using complete genome sequences from
these 150 strains, a GWAS will be conducted to identify
candidate genes underlying each trait.
Description: Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) caused by the
fungus Cercospora beticola (Cb) is an important disease
on sugar beets. CLS is typically controlled with fungi-
cides, but resistance has become a problem in many
locations and there would be economic and ecological
benets associated with using genetic resistance instead
of fungicides to control CLS. Cb populations in Europeand North America have already shown their ability
to evolve resistance to fungicides, but it is unknown
how they will respond to deployment of CLS resistant
cultivars.
Pathogen population genetic structure has proven to
be one of the best predictors of pathogen evolutionary
potential. The core of this project is oriented around
obtaining a detailed understanding of the population
genetics of Cb to provide insight into the distribution
of gene and genotype diversity within and among Cb
populations sampled from dierent regions around the
world. The results will enable quantitative assessments
of the importance of sexual recombination, gene ow and
eective population size, all of which aect a pathogen's
evolutionary potential. This comprehensive population
genetic analysis can be used to develop an overall risk
assessment model for Cb that would consider both the
evolution of virulence against resistance genes and the
emergence of fungicide resistance. The analysis will
also consider the potential for long-distance gene and
genotype ow and the likely importance of sexual re-
combination.
In the rst phase of the project, the student will obtain
completely assembled PacBio genome sequences for 2
European strains of Cb and Illumina genome sequences
for 10 additional strains of Cb. These genome sequences
will be used to identify 20 robust SSR loci that can be
assayed in ~1000 global strains of Cb, with 30-50 strains
coming from each sugar beet eld. The SSR data will
be collected from all global strains and used to conduct
detailed population genetic analyses.
In the second phase of the project, the student will iden-
tify~150 global Cb strains to use in an FST/QST anal-
ysis. FST/QST analyses provide a powerful approach
to identify quantitative traits that are under selection
for local adaptation, as shown in our earlier work with
three other fungal plant pathogens. In the framework of
the FST/QST analysis, we will collect phenotypic data
for a series of in vitro traits, including melanization, and
growth rates at dierent temperatures, in the presence
or absence of fungicides and in the presence or absence
of reactive oxygen stress provided by hydrogen perox-
ide. For each trait, we will partition the phenotypic
variance into components reecting variance within eld
populations and between eld populations (i.e. QST)
and compare this to the distribution of neutral genetic
variance for SNP markers (i.e. FST) distributed among
the same populations. The SNP markers will be based
on complete genome sequences obtained from each of
the 150 strains used in the FST/QST analysis.
In the third phase of the project, the student will use the
phenotype data collected in the FST/QST analysis andJune 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
the SNP data obtained from the 150 genome sequences
to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
aiming towards determining the genetic architecture of
each quantitative trait and identifying candidate genes
underlying each trait.
Qualications of the applicants: Applicants should have
a masters degree in bioinformatics, biology, microbiology
or a similar qualication. Previous experience in popu-
lation genetics, evolutionary biology, plant pathology or
mycology will oer an advantage. We seek individuals
who possess good collaboration skills, can take their
own initiative, and work independently.

tive genetics

Freie Universitaet Berlin, Germany Open PhD position:
Eco-evo-immunity of Drosophila ' bacteria interactions
Application deadline: 10th June 2019
The Evolution and Ecology of Insect Defences group at
the Institute of Biology, Freie Universitaet (FU) Berlin,
Germany, would like to invite applications for a PhD
position (TV-L E13, 50%) for the research project: Eco-
evo-immunity of Drosophila ' bacteria interactions. The
position is xed-term and available for 3.5 years and
it will start in August 2019, or as soon as possible
thereafter.
Project background Our research lies in the eld
of eco-evo-immunology, focusing on host resistance
and tolerance to infection (https://armitagelab.com/).
Pathogens can have substantial negative tness eects
on their hosts. This creates a strong selection pressure
on a host to have ecient immune defences. A host cancounteract an infection by directly reducing its pathogen
load, i.e., resistance, or by reducing the harm that the
infection does to its tness, i.e., tolerance. Given that re-
sistance can be costly and involve autoimmune damage,
a more resistant host is not always the ttest. Tolerance
is therefore an interesting concept because it describes
how well hosts are able to ameliorate the tness costs of
a given pathogen load. Resistance and tolerance are pre-
dicted to give contrasting perspectives on host-pathogen
evolution and infectious diseases, therefore it is impor-
tant to understand infection in the light of these two
concepts. The project will involve studying the interac-
tion between the host (Drosophila melanogaster) and
bacterial pathogens during the infection process, with
the objectives to understand how tness parameters
interrelate with each other and describe host sickness
trajectories and the eects that defences have upon the
evolution of the pathogen. The project will follow the
progression of the infection within the host (resistance),
and it's longitudinal eect on host tness parameters
such as health-, behaviour- and fecundity-tolerance.
Requirements Completed University Master's degree in
biology.
Desirable - We would like applications from enthusias-
tic and highly motivated students with a background
/ strong interest in evolutionary ecology. - Ability to
work independently. - Good team-working and com-
munication skills. - Laboratory experience with either
bacteria or insects. - Good basic knowledge of statistics
and experimental design. - Procient in spoken and
written English. - Experience: Completed projects /

Iceland 2 SticklebackEvolution
*Two PhD positions on ECO-EVO-DEVO dynamics in
threespine stickleback of lake M yvatn, Iceland*
H olar University, Iceland, seeks two PhD students for
a Grant of Excellence (RANNIS) project to study the
dynamics of *Ecological (ECO), Evolutionary (EVO)
and Developmental (DEVO) processes*
The phenotype is an important determinant of the dy-
namic interactions between ecological and evolutionary
processes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) and the processes
that shape biological diversity in face of global change.
This project will study the interplay among ECO, EVO
and DEVO to understand 1) the dual role of ecology in
evolution (as driver of natural selection and phenotypic
plasticity), 2) the molecular mechanisms underlying
phenotypic variation, and 3) the feedbacks between phe-
notypic change and ecosystem function. The project
uses threespine stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*)
from lake M yvatn, Iceland, as a model. The project is
led by Prof. Bjarni K. Kristj ansson (lead PI, H olar Uni-
versity, Iceland) and Dr. Katja R as anen (Swiss Federal
Institute of Aquatic Sciences, Eawag, Switzerland). It
is part of a large collaboration across H olar University

Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, USA (Prof. Anthony R.
Ives), Univ. of Iceland (Prof. Zophon as O. J onsson)
and the M yvatn research station (Dr. Arni Einarsson).
We are looking for two excellent PhD students to work
on two complementary aspects of the project: *i) the de-
terminants of phenotypic variation and ii) consequences
of phenotypic and genetic variation for ecosystem pro-
cesses. *Which of these aspects each student specically
focuses on will depend on their interests as well as ex-
pertise (to be stated in application, see below). These
student projects are an integral part of research that
includes long-term eld data, laboratory, mesocosm and
eld experiments, genomics and mathematical modelling.
We are an international research team dedicated to high
quality training. The students will have the opportunity
to conduct part of their research at the collaborative
institutions.
*Location*: The students will be based at the Dept. of
Aquaculture and Fish Biology (DAFB - http://holar.is/-

H olar University (North Iceland) and registered at the
Univ. of Iceland (Reykjavik). HU is situated in thebeautiful Hjaltadalur (Skagafjordur), with oces and
research laboratories in the nearby town Sau arkr okur.
DAFB is an active research centre and the students
will become part of a dynamic international team of
graduate students and faculty. The beautiful natural
setting and central location in North of Iceland oer
both outdoor and cultural activities.
*Requirements: *The candidates must hold a MSc de-
gree in a relevant eld (e.g. Ecology, Molecular Biol-
ogy, Evolution, or Development). The ideal candidates
have a strong interest in *evolutionary ecology, *enjoy
working in a dynamic group, and have experience from
eldwork and laboratory work (with relative importance
depending on the project specics). Expertise and in-

Ph.D. Student position: The diversity and dynamics of
insect microbiomes
The new Symbiosis Evolution research group at the
Institute of Environmental Sciences of Jagiellonian Uni-versity in Krakow, Poland is seeking a motivated Ph.D.
Student to join the project \The insect microbiome
dynamics in time and space", recently funded by the
Polish National Science Centre (NCN) OPUS grant.
Insects frequently associate with microbes, forming dif-
ferent types of symbiotic associations that often play
major roles in the insect biology. We know that the
microbiome abundance, composition, and roles vary
among insect species, but they also often dier among
populations, sampling dates, and among individuals
sampled from a population at the same time. However,
our understanding of the microbiome diversity patterns
across insects, and factors that inuence them, remains
limited. Our team's goal is a broad, comprehensive
survey of microbial symbioses across the diversity of
Swedish insects. We will do this in close collaboration
with Insect Biome Atlas, an international project sam-
pling ying insect communities at hundreds of sites. We
will use large numbers of insects carefully selected from
that collection for the microbiome characterization us-
ing high-throughput next-generation sequencing. This
approach will allow us to understand the microbiome
composition across the taxonomic diversity of insects,
as well as to describe the seasonal changes, geographic
variation, and the eects of environmental factors on
microbiomes of selected, broadly distributed species.
The Ph.D. Student will primarily focus on the study
of the diversity of microbes across thousands of insect
species, addressing the question of how the microbiomes
vary across the insect phylogeny. Initially, the Stu-
dent will work with Swedish partners on preparing and
curating large numbers of insect specimens for the mi-
crobiome characterization, while learning the relevant
bioinformatic techniques. They will also participate
in high-throughput next-generation sequencing library
preparation. However, their main task is going to be
the bioinformatic analysis of large amounts of insect
microbiome composition and metagenomics data. The
Student will be encouraged to work closely with other
team members and project collaborators, including In-
sect Biome Atlas consortium members in Sweden and
Dr. Brandon Cooper at the University of Montana,
U.S.A.
The Student will be based at one of the top research in-
stitutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolution in Central
Europe, in a medieval city known as the cultural capi-
tal of Poland, with good access to outdoor recreation
opportunities and well-connected to the rest of Europe.
They will be supported by a 36-month, tax-free research
stipend, starting at 3500 PLN ( ~800 EUR) per month
and increasing during subsequent years to 4500 PLN
(~1050 EUR) per month. This stipend may be combined
with the standard Ph.D. program scholarship. Note that28 EvolDir June 1, 2019

LeedsU EvolutionaryGenomics
4 year Faculty funded PhD studentship at the Univer-
sity of Leeds in Evolutionary Genomics of Galapagos
Iguanas. Open to UK and EU students only.
This project provides a unique opportunity to examine
adaptation and evolutionary history in an the marine
(Amblyrhynchus cristatus) and land iguanas (Conolo-
phus sp) of the Galapagos archipelago. Both genera
of Galapagos iguanas originate from the same common
ancestor, diverging around 4.5-10.5 million years ago,
with both groups subsequently spreading across the
archipelago. Land iguanas diversied to form 3 species
- Conolophus subcristatus, native to six islands, and
Conolophus pallidus, which is restricted to Santa Fe.
The third species Conolophus marthae, known as the
pink iguana, is only found on Volcan Wolf at the north-
ern end of Isabela. It was only recently recognised as
forming a genetically and ecologically distinct species
and is now considered endangered due to its small pop-
ulation size and restricted distribution.
The process of divergence and diversication among
these iguanas has generated many novel adaptations
over relatively short evolutionary timescales V most
strikingly adaptation to diving and the marine environ-
ment in Amblyrhynchus cristatus, which is the worlds
only fully marine lizard. Land iguanas have their own
adaptations to the harsh terrestrial environment in the
Galapagos, including diet, tolerance of arid conditionsand uctuating resources, as well as various dierences
in morphology and pigmentation. This provides an
amazing natural model system for evolutionary biolo-
gists to characterise the genomic basis of adaptation
and novel phenotypes; the process of speciation, includ-
ing mechanisms that prevent hybridization and genetic
introgression; as well as characterising the origins and
history of iguana populations. These can be linked with
palao- and present environmental data to yield a bet-
ter understanding of the environmental and ecological
conditions which drove the evolution of these species.
The project is a part of a collaborative iguana genome
and evolution consortium led by Dr Gabriele Gentile
at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. Dr Gentile
has been pioneering the study and conservation of pink
iguanas for many years. The student will spend time
working in both Leeds and Rome.
Multiple genome sequences for all land and marine
iguana species are currently being generated, as a result
of a collaboration between the University of Rome Tor
Vergata and the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (Prof.
Mohd Firdaus Raih) and will be completed shortly.
This is essentially a bioinformatics/computation project,
but there may be opportunities to gain hands on labo-
ratory experience of associated DNA sequencing tech-
niques. The project will use data from a range of Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches including
de novo sequencing on Illumina and other platforms
to build and annotate de novo assemblies of iguana
genomes. Data will be then be analysed with a range
of bioinformatics, population genomics and molecular
evolution tools in high performance computing environ-
ments, as appropriate to the research questions.
An interest in working at the interface of ecology, bio-
diversity and population/evolutionary genomics is de-
sirable. Prior experience of bioinformatics is helpful
but not essential. However interest in developing skills
in bioinformatics and computing is important. This
project is part of a consortium involving researchers
from the University of Leeds, University of Rome, Tor
Vergata, and Universiti Kebangsaan, Malaysia. The stu-
dent will join the Ecology and Evolution group in the
School of Biology, Leeds, and will be integrated with
the LIDA and Leeds Omics, virtual institutes which
encompass a large group of researchers working on ge-
nomics and bioinformatics related projects. The student
will also spend signicant time working with Dr Gentile
in Rome, and visiting other collaborating institutions
across Europe and further aeld.

SeaCowComparativeGenomics
PhD student (m/f/d) (TV-L E13, 65%)
Location: Rudolf Sch onheimer Institute of Biochemistry
(Faculty of Medicine) and the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Germany
Starting date: Spring/Summer 2019
Project: We are looking for a highly motivated PhD
student for a 3-year position. The main project deals
with comparative genomics of the ancient Steller's Sea
Cow Genome. This project aims to identify pathways
and genes involved in body size and energy storage by
comparing the genomes of the ancient Steller's sea cow,
possibly the largest recent non-cetacean mammal, to
the ones of the modern smaller sirenians, the dugong
and the manatee. We also intend to detect how climate
adaptation may shape genetic data by selection since un-
like the modern sirenians, which are adapted to a warm
climate, the Steller's sea cow inhabited arctic environ-
ments. Additionally, we will build the phylogenetic tree
of the sirenians, including genomic data of the hyraxes
as a more distant outgroup than the African elephant.
A second running project deals with gene expression pro-
les of lipomas. By analyzing the dierential expression
of genes in lipoma versus matched normal subcutaneous
adipose tissue we intend to identify genetic networks
that are involved in lipid accumulation with a long-term
goal of better understanding mechanisms of obesity. At
the Rudolf Sch onheimer Institute of Biochemistry (Fac-
ulty of Medicine) we aim to understand medicine in the
context of evolution. Leipzig University developed a
major research focus in obesity. The two projects the
PhD student is involved in inquires the same question
using dierent perspectives and techniques.
Collaboration Partners: The project oers stimulating
interactions and training opportunities including the
Human Genetics Institute in Leipzig, the Institute for
Biochemistry and Biology, Department of Mathematics
and Natural Sciences, Potsdam University, and the De-partment of Bioinformatics and Genetics of the Swedish
Museum of Natural History.
Prole of candidate's qualications: If you are highly
motivated, fascinated by evolution and translating the
ndings to modern medicine, this may be the right po-
sition for you. Programming experience in R, python,
and C++, as well as working in Linux environment will
be of benet.
Our oer: - a supportive and international working
environment - access to cutting edge genomics, com-
puting, and research facilities - the chance to pursue
fundamental research of medical relevance - enrollment
and graduation within the International Max Planck
Research Schools (IMPRS) Programme

SocialInsectEvolution
3 PhD positions in evolutionary biology of social in-
sects at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,
Germany The Institute of Organismic and Molecular
Evolution is seeking candidates for 3 PhD positions
(starting October 1st 2019) to study the molecular reg-
ulation of ant social life within the Research Training
Group GenEvo.
Position 1 ' Molecular regulation of reproduction in in-
sect societies (co-supervised by Romain Libbrecht and
Ren e Ketting). The main feature of social insects is
the reproductive division of labour, whereby queens
monopolize reproduction while sterile workers perform
other tasks to maintain the colony. Investigating the
molecular mechanisms regulating reproduction and di-
vision of labour in ants is necessary to understand the
evolution and ecological success of insect societies. The
clonal raider ant O. biroi has emerged as a powerful
study system to investigate gene regulatory processes
and the molecular regulation of reproduction (Chan-
dra et al. 2018, Libbrecht et al. 2016, Libbrecht et al.
2018). This project will identify putative gene regu-
latory mechanisms associated with reproduction, and
investigate the functional link between social cues (pres-
ence of larvae), regulatory mechanisms, gene expression,
and reproduction. It will thus shed light on the regula-
tion and evolution of reproductive division of labour in
insect societies, as well as on how gene regulation can
translate social cues into physiological changes.
Position 2 ' Gene regulation and division of labour (co-
supervised by Susanne Foitzik, Peter Baumann, Susanne
Gerber). Social insect workers specialise in specic tasks
and this division of labour contributes to the ecological
success of insect societies. Task specialisation is mostly
neither genetically determined nor rigid, but changes
with age and colony needs. Typically, young workerstakeover brood care, whereas older workers focus on
risky tasks. The expression of behavioural genes shifts
with the tasks of workers and histone acetylation can reg-
ulate task-specic gene expression (Simola et al. 2016).
Our preliminary work revealed division of labour, the
expression and functions of task-specic genes (Feld-
meyer et al. 2014; Kohlmeier et al. 2018; 2019), and the
importance of histone acetylation for their expression
in the ant Temnothorax longispinosus. This projects
aims to understand how dierent regulatory processes
respond to external cues, the expression of which genes
they alter and how fast they can change gene expression.
It will thus give insights into the molecular regulation
of worker division of labour in social insects.
Position 3 ' Parasite interference with gene regulation
of a social host (co-supervised by Susanne Foitzik, Peter
Baumann, Falk Butter). Parasites with complex life cy-
cles often manipulate the behaviour of their intermediate
hosts to increase transmission to the denite host and
we hypothesise that they do so by interfering with host
gene regulation. Infection of Temnothorax nylanderi ant
larvae with the parasitic cestode Anomotaenia brevis
strongly alters the adult phenotype. Parasitized workers
exhibit altered behaviour, morphology, chemical prole
and a lifespan extension (Scharf et al. 2012, Beros et
al. 2015), and these changes are linked to transcrip-
tomic alterations (Feldmeyer et al. 2016). The cestode,
residing in its cysticercoid stage in the ants' gaster is
transcriptionally active and releases many proteins into
the host. The aim of this project is to demonstrate
that parasite-induced changes in host phenotype are
actively promoted by the parasite. We therefore will
study how the cestode parasite interferes with the hosts'
gene regulation, which gene-regulatory mechanisms are
utilised and whether these alterations are permanent or
have to be actively maintained. This project will reveal
genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of behaviour and
longevity in social insects and will uncover the mecha-
nisms of across-species interference in gene regulation.
We are looking for highly motivated students with a Mas-
ter degree (or equivalent) in biology, good English skills,
and a keen interest in evolutionary biology. Previous
experience with social insects, statistics and bioinformat-
ics is advantageous, but not required. Successful appli-
cants will join an international, interactive, dynamic and
English-speaking scientic environment in a brand new
building with access to state-of-the-art, newly equipped
laboratories and climate-controlled rooms. The JGU of
Mainz hosts many excellent scientic institutions, and
Mainz is a historic city located on the Rhine River with
a large student population and a rich social and cultural
life.

PhD projects in mitonuclear ecology, genetics, and be-
haviour
TWO fully-funded Ph.D. positions are available for
projects that will seek to understand how genetic varia-
tion within the mitochondrial genome inuences organ-
ism performance, life history, and evolution.
The projects will involve testing emerging hypotheses
from the rapidly growing eld known as \mitonuclear
ecology," which explores how mitochondrial genetics and
biochemistry (driven by interacting mitochondrial and
nuclear genomes) inuence fundamental behavioural,
ecological, and evolutionary processes-from the complex
pre-copulatory behaviours associated with mating to
reproductive outcomes to ageing.Project 1 will address the physiological and behavioural
consequences of variation in mitochondrial performance.
The project will test new hypotheses for how mitochon-
drial function aects individual \quality" and thereby
mating behaviour; depending on student experience and
interests, the project can test these hypotheses from the
bottom up (biochemistry/physiology) and/or the top
down (evolutionary/behavioural ecology).
Project 2 will address the genotypic contributions of
mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (and their interac-
tions) to sex dierences in organismal life history, from
reproductive performance to longevity. This project
will explore the functional consequences of mito-nuclear
genetic variation, with a focus on testing an evolution-
ary hypothesis known as \Mother's Curse"3
4i.e, that
maternal inheritance of mitochondria has led to the
accumulation of mutations within the mitochondrial
DNA sequence that confer harm to males, but which
are benign or benecial in eect to females.
Both projects will integrate techniques and experimental
designs drawn from evolutionary biology, ecology, genet-
ics, and physiology. A key tool will be genetic strains of
fruit ies (Drosophila melanogaster) in which dierent
mitochondrial DNA haplotypes have been introgressed
alongside a diverse set of nuclear DNA backgrounds.
This system oers the invaluable opportunity to sepa-
rate mitochondrial and nuclear genetic eects on organ-
ismal function, exploring the downstream consequences
of mitochondrial variation on individual behaviors and
physiology. There will be full exibility for the success-
ful applicants to pursue their own academic ideas and
interests within the scope of their projects.
We are seeking students who are highly motivated and
passionate about evolutionary biology, the mechanistic
bases of animal behaviour, and/or mitonuclear ecology;
applicants should be familiar with the fundamentals of
evolutionary theory and behavioural ecology. The suc-
cessful candidates will be supervised by A/Prof. Damian

EcologyButteryInversions
PhD studentship on the ecology of inversions and bal-
ancing selection in butteries, CNRS Montpellier France
A fully-funded 3-year PhD studentship is available at the
CNRS Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology
(CEFE) in Montpellier, France, under the supervision
of Mathieu Joron, on the ecology of balancing selection.
Closing date. 12/06/2019. Application portal: http://-
bit.ly/2JV8AyB The project focuses on deciphering the
evolution of a complex of polymorphic inversions form-
ing a supergene in an Amazonian buttery (Heliconius
numata). The supergene controls switches in wing pat-
tern elements, whose linked variation produces distinct
morphs shaped by natural selection favouring mimicry
with other defended species. Inversion polymorphism
is promoted by negative assortative (or 'disassortative')
mate preferences among mimetic morphs. Yet we ignore
why and how these preferences have evolved, or howinversion polymorphism has become associated with a
diversity of wing patterns. The PhD project will help
decipher the selective factors (viability trade-os, dele-
terious variation, etc.) and the mating cues associated
with the maintenance of inversion polymorphism, and
will improve our understanding of the stability of com-
plex polymorphisms involving the covariation of multiple
traits.
The project will largely rest on insectary and eld exper-
imental data. Diverse approaches to characterise trait
variation associated with inversions may be developed
during the PhD (e.g. morphometrics, chemical ecology,
physiology...). The project allows for much exibility
in the direction taken, depending on the student's in-
terests and ideas. By collaborating with team members
focused on the genomics of inversions, the student will
also be able to tackle the link between natural and sex-
ual selection and the underlying genetic architecture of
traits.
The student will join a lively consortium of teams whose
research combines experimental approaches with pop-
ulation genomics (CEFE Montpellier), bioinformatics
(Claire Lemaitre, INRIA Rennes), and evolutionary the-
ory (Violaine Llaurens, MNHN Paris).
The student will receive rst-class education in biology
bridging many disciplines from behavioural ecology to
evolutionary genomics and bioinformatics. The student
will attend advanced courses, workshops and conferences,
will interact with other team members working on re-
lated projects, and will report his/her results in progress
meeting, international conferences, publications, and a
written thesis in French or in English which should be
completed within three years.
The student must have a degree in ecology/evolution,
a keen interest in ecology and evolution and excellent
understanding of the underlying theory, outstanding
academic achievement, a background in experimental
or eld-based research, and must not be afraid of work-
ing with caterpillars. Independence and motivation are
essential to successfully carry out challenging eld and
experimental work overseas in the Amazon, as well as
with collaborating teams in French Guiana and Panama.
The CEFE is the largest ecology lab in France and is
a major institute for evolutionary ecology and genetics.
Within CEFE, our team comprises 12 researchers whose
research combines genetics and evolutionary ecology to
address a diversity of topics on adaptation and natural
variation. Our group focuses on buttery wing patterns
as a model to decipher how diversity is shaped by nat-
ural selection and other processes at the phenotypic
and genomic level. Montpellier is a major hotspot for
evolutionary and environmental research worldwide andJune 1, 2019 EvolDir 35
has a vibrant research community with several hundred
researchers in this domain, and highly praised gradu-
ate programmes. The University of Montpellier ranked
1st in the 2018 Shanghai ranking in Ecology. Montpel-
lier lies near the Mediterranean region in the South of
France and enjoys pleasant weather, fantastic nature
and great cultural and city life.
Starting date should be in September or October 2019.
Net salary is around 20.5Keuro /year, including social
benets and public health insurance.
Applications should be done through the CNRS portal.
See http://bit.ly/2JV8AyB. Applicants should upload
a letter of application explaining their motivation and
achievements, a paragraph on the preferred questions
they would like to address or focus on during the project,
a full CV, academic transcripts, and the names and con-
tact details of two references. Closing date. 12/06/2019.

August 2019
We are seeking to ll a PhD position funded by the
Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) in the group
of Lukas R ~A^A1
4ber to look at comparative genomics
and phylogenomics of miniature shes. This is a joint
placement between the Department of Vertebrates, Nat-
ural History Museum Bern (NMBE) and the Institute36 EvolDir June 1, 2019
of Ecology and Evolution (IEE), University of Bern.
The zebrash, Danio rerio, is one of the most important
vertebrate models for studies of development, genome
evolution, and disease. This project aims to investi-
gate the evolutionary consequences of miniaturization
in close relatives of the zebrash, including some of
the most striking examples of miniaturization in ver-
tebrates. We recently sequenced the genome of the
dwarf minnow genus Paedocypris, comprising the small-
est sh species, to investigate for the rst time the
genomic consequences of miniaturization in vertebrate
species. We discovered drastic genome size reduction
and extensive loss of Hox and other developmental genes
in Paedocypris (Malmstr ~A^Am et al. 2018, https://-
doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy058). In the PhD project, we
will use whole genome data for an in-depth exploration
of the evolutionary consequences of miniaturization in
a broader comparative framework by providing a ro-
bust phylogenetic framework of zebrash relatives. We
will examine whether genome size reduction and exten-
sive loss of developmental genes are general features of
miniaturization in these shes.
We are looking for a committed and enthusiastic candi-
date with an MSc or an equivalent university degree in bi-
ology/bioinformatics and a strong background/interest
in evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, genomics and
bioinformatics. Experience in tropical eldwork and
knowledge of sh systematics is an advantage. The PhD
candidate will conduct demanding eldwork in South-
east Asia collecting miniature cyprinid shes, carry out
whole genome sequencing of the collected material, and
conduct phylogenomic analyses and comparative ge-
nomic analyses focusing on the evolution of genome size
and Hox genes in the group. Our working language is
English and excellent communication and writing skills
in English are essential.
The project involves several partners including Ralf
Britz (Natural History Museum, UK), Richard Durbin
(University of Cambridge, UK), Kerstin Howe (Well-
come Sanger Institute, UK), Catherine Peichel (Uni-
versity of Bern, Switzerland) and Walter Salzburger
(University of Basel, Switzerland). During the duration
of the project, there will be opportunities for short-term
visits to the laboratories of the project partners. Lukas
R~A^A1
4ber (NMBE and IEE) will supervise the PhD stu-
dent with co-supervision provided by Catherine Peichel
and Walter Salzburger.
Salary for this four-year project is at SNSF PhD Fellow-
ship level and the position is available from August 1st,
2019.
Bern is a vibrant city with a beautiful historic old town
that has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Siteoering excellent quality of life. The nearby majestic

GrapeColdAdaptation
Cold tolerance in North Dakota grape cultivars
Two MS positions are available to study the mechanisms
contributing to cold adaptation in North Dakota grape
cultivars with Jill Hamilton (Biological Sciences) and
Harlene Hatterman-Valenti (Plant Sciences) at North
Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota avail-
able starting August 2019 or January 2020.
The ability to grow competitively, while reducing the risk
of winter injury represents a critical trade-o mediated
by environmental cues for many species. In grapevines,
sensitivity to environmental cues, particularly temper-
ature and photoperiod, which may accelerate or delay
development of dormancy, will impact cultivar health
and consequent fruit production. This project aims to
comprehensively assess the interaction between temper-
ature cues, phenology, and cold hardiness across mul-
tiple growing seasons in North Dakota grape cultivars.
This project will systematically assess the ne-scale
relationship between temperature and the induction
and breakup of dormancy and dormancy-related traits
for six grape cultivars replicated four times across two
distinct environments. The graduate student will (i)
monitor temperature, (ii) phenological shifts over timeJune 1, 2019 EvolDir 37
in response to environmental cues, and (iii) estimate
development of cold hardiness using electrolytic leak-
age or dierential thermal analysis. Data developed
through this research will be used to test and optimize
models that simulate life history transitions in response
to environmental cues for North Dakota grape cultivars.
Results from this work will provide valuable informa-
tion for varietal development and may be used for risk-
management to predict winter injury.
The ideal MS student will be prepared to lead eld-
based research monitoring phenological shifts in response
to shifting environmental (temperature) cues and test-
ing for cold hardiness using dierent experimental ap-
proaches, including electrolytic leakage and dierential
thermal analysis. In addition, the student will test an
established model using North Dakota grape cultivars
that predicts shifts in cold hardiness associated with
the induction and breakup of dormancy. There is plenty
of room to pursue particular interests in adaptive trait
variation depending on the interest and experience of
the candidate. The student will also be involved in
outreach activities associated with the project engaging
with local state agencies, grape growers, and wine pro-
ducers in the region. Ability to work independently in
the eld, alongside basic botanical and plant physiology
expertise is required. Some experience in quantitative
analysis and modeling in R and previous experience
evaluating physiological trait variation is preferred.

Description of the thesis topic
Abstract Due to the access to large amounts of genomic
data and the recent advancements in IA, several machine
learning based methods are currently being developed
in the population genetics eld, among which a few aim
at reconstructing the demographic history of popula-
tions. A challenge is to integrate in the studies of human
populations cultural phenomena such as the cultural
transmission of reproductive success. This transmission
exists when the reproductive success of individuals de-
pends on a cultural trait (wealth, social status, network
of knowledge) that is itself transmitted from one gener-
ation to the next. This process strongly inuences the
evolution of genetic diversity and we have previously
designed a statistic that detects unilinear transmission
based on the unbalance of coalescence trees (through
women with mitochondrial DNA or through men with
the Y chromosome). The objective of this PhD is to
focus on an entirely dierent scale thanks to large sets
of genomic data and develop machine learning and deep
learning methods capable of detecting this transmis-
sion when it aects the entire genome as a result of
transmission by both men and women.
Aims Developing methods that can detect the existence
of transmission of reproductive success in large genomic
data sets by combining a set of signals. Machine learn-
ing approaches make it possible to jointly use multiple
patterns, whether computed based on expert knowledge,
or detected automatically. However, these methods,38 EvolDir June 1, 2019
and in particular the ones based on deep learning, have
never been used for the inference of cultural traits and
have been emerging only recently in population genetics.
Methods (1) Simulations of whole genome genetic data
under dierent scenarios, with or without transmission
of reproductive success (based on forward simulations in
which one can integrate complex processes such as a re-
production success depending on the number of siblings)
(2) Implementation of several statistics related to the
transmission of reproductive success, demography and
selection (tree shape, Fst, shared haplotype length, allele
frequencies) and exploration of their distribution along
the genome for extreme scenarios. These generated data
and statistics will be used to train or test the following
statistical learning approaches. (3) Semi-automatic in-
ference. Methodological development for classication
(predict whether or not there is a transmission of repro-
ductive success) and inference (estimate of transmission
factor) from the summary statistics proposed in step (2)
using Approximate Bayesian Computation and Random
Forest (Pudlo et al., 2016, Raynal et al., 2017) or deep
MLP networks (Multi Layer Perceptron, Sheehan and
Song 2016). This approach will allow the use of a large
number of summary statistics, hence a better coverage of
the characteristics of the transmission process. (4) Au-
tomatic inference. Replacing the task of designing and
choosing expert statistics with the automatic detection
of signals characterizing the transmission of the success
of the reproduction. To do this, the same set of simu-
lated genetic data can be used to train a more complex
neural network. In particular, it has been shown very
recently that demography, selection and recombination
signals (at the population level) can be detected using
convolutional neural networks (work in progress at LRI,
Sanchez et al. JDSE2017, Chan et al., 2018, Flagel et
al., 2018). These methods need to be extended to the
estimation the transmission of reproductive success. (5)

Queen Mary University of London Funded PhD position:
Genomics of African indigenous cattle Deadline: 23rd
June 2019
We are currently seeking highly motivated PhD student
for a fully-funded project to start in September 2019.
The project will focus on analysing molecular data from
modern and museum cattle samples to unravel their
population histories in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to a rich but poorly un-
derstood diversity of indigenous cattle breeds. Many
of the regions ~150 indigenous breeds show unusual re-
sistance to extremes of climate and disease, and these
traits are likely to become increasingly important in the
face of climate change and mixing of stocks. Despite
this, many of these local cattle breeds are endangered,
facing threats from uncontrolled crossbreeding, as well
as from replacement by exotic yet ill-adapted European
breeds. There is a now an urgent need to identify and
characterise the genomic diversity of African cattle, to
better manage and retain genetic diversity and avoid
the permanent loss of desirable traits.
Genetically-varied African cattle breeds have evolved
from a complex history of articial and natural selection.
The student will use genomic methods to reconstruct
these processes. These analyses will be able to address
key questions concerning African cattle, such as the
origin and number of introductions of zebu cattle. The
student will also perform analyses to quantify genetic
diversity available in African cattle populations, and
identify key genetic markers for disease, fertility and
drought resistance in the genome of specic populations.
This studentship is fully-funded by Queen Mary Uni-
versity of London (QMUL) and is aligned to the UKs
overseas development strategy. The PhD student will
be trained in population genetics, genomics and bioin-
formatics by the supervisory team. Data collection,
generation, and analyses will be funded by our non-
academic partner SilverStreet Capital.
The successful candidate is expected to have a strong
academic background with a at least a 1st class orJune 1, 2019 EvolDir 39
2.1 Bachelors degree (or equivalent). An MSc in a
relevant eld (genomics, evolutionary biology, bioin-

evolutionary genetics, and/or conservation issues, would
also be advantageous. Candidates can contact either

post.queensu.ca/ ~birdpop/index.html As numerically
dominant apex predators, seabirds are key components
of Canada's arctic marine ecosystem. Seabirds and
their eggs also are important to the culture and diet
of indigenous Arctic peoples. However, Arctic seabird
populations are facing multiple simultaneous direct and
indirect threats from climate change, shipping and in-
dustrial development. Unsurprisingly, many populations
are showing signs of stress such as reduced reproduc-
tive success or declining numbers. To avoid extinction,
wildlife populations must adapt through (1) changes in
behaviour or physiology, (2) dispersal, or (3) genetic
changes. The capacity for seabirds to adapt through
these three avenues is virtually unknown, but it is criti-cal to maintenance of healthy populations. New genomic
methods, especially when combined with on-going stud-
ies of behaviour and physiology, provide powerful oppor-
tunities to determine the long-term sensitivities of Arctic
seabirds to climate change and industrial development.
We will use genomic, behavioural and ecological data
in a landscape context to estimate levels of phenotypic
plasticity, dispersal, and genomic variation for seven
seabird species that Canada has a global responsibility
to protect. Results will help Environment and Climate
Change Canada (ECCC) develop science-based policies
for Arctic stewardship. The students will be responsi-
ble for analysis of one species, and will gain training
in population and landscape genomics, bioinformatics,
population modeling and arctic ecology.

Scientic Background Among the potential solutions
for a sustainable agriculture, the concept of ecological
intensication is particularly promising. It hinges on
the hypothesis that by acting on populations and diver-
sity of service providers, it is possible to increase the
multi-functionality of ecosystems. To fully deploy an
ecological intensication strategy and ensure optimum
delivery of ecosystem services, a better understanding of
the underpinning mechanisms shaping not only biodiver-
sity but also interaction networks and their associated
services is needed. In agroecosystems, regulatory ser-
vices such as animal pollination and biological control of
pests are particularly important because they have the
potential to maintain or increase crop production while
reducing chemical inputs. These services are based not
only on key species but also on their trophic interactions.
Food webs are traditionally described as stable states
while they are intrinsically dynamic. This is particularly
true in agricultural landscapes of annual crops where
resources vary considerably throughout the season until
the almost complete disappearance of the base of the
food web (the primary producer). When harvesting an40 EvolDir June 1, 2019
annual crop, the sudden disappearance of the resource
and habitat leads to a drastic reduction of invertebrate
populations and consequently a collapse of the food
webs. Yet these networks are re-built every year from a
limited number of early colonisers coming from neigh-
bouring \refuge" habitat (e.g. natural or semi-natural
habitat), or emerging directly from the eld when they
manage to survive winter and soil handling (e.g. tillage).
In theory, the rst individuals that manage to colonise
early in the season are likely to determine the make-up
of the future populations within a given year and in a
given eld.
Aim The aim of this PhD project is to describe of the
temporal dynamics of species assemblages and interac-
tion networks involving key species of regulatory services
in oilseed rape (OSR) crops. The three services selected
for the project are 1) predation of insect pests by ground
beetles, 2) impact of parasitoid wasps on aphids and
3) pollination by wild and domestic bees. This PhD
project will use innovative environmental genomics tools
to describe the spatial and temporal dynamics of insect
trophic interactions. A DNA metabarcoding approach
will be applied to the stomach contents of ground beetles
caught in Barber traps, parasitized aphids (mummies)
collected on the OSR and pollen pellets collected by
wild and domestic bees.
Methods High throughput DNA sequencing and eld
observations will help decipher trophic interactions and
quantify regulatory services (predation, parasitism, pol-
lination) provided by predatory beetles, parasitoids and
pollinators. These regulatory services will be studied in
rape crops through the analysis of food web dynamics
on a very ne time scale (monthly surveys) and wide
spatial scale (from the plot to the landscape). For this,
about thirty elds of rapeseed will be sampled each year
on the Zone Atelier Plaine and Val de S evres. This
study site includes 19,000 agricultural parcels covering
450 km2, and oers a quasi-experimental context where
it is possible to test the impact of agricultural prac-
tices and landscape heterogeneity on the structuring
and dynamics of interaction networks. Plots selected
for the study will be distributed along gradients of in-
terest such as agricultural intensication or distance to
semi-natural areas. In addition, an existing research
partnership between farmers and the CEBC AGRIPOP
team will lead to controlled experiments in the eld.
Prerequisites This project will be based at the Insect
Biology Research Institute (IRBI) in Tours and will
include sample collection campaigns at the Chiz e Bio-
logical Study Center (CEBC). Samples will be analyzed

TU Munich
EvolutionaryGenomicsTomato
The Chair of Phytopathology at the Technical University
of Munich, TUM School of Life Sciences,
hires a PhD Student to study
Molecular genomics of secondary metabolite pathways
in wild tomato species.
We are interested in understanding the diversity and
evolution of pathogen resistance within plant species.
Therefore we study dierent populations from a di-
verse and geographically dierentiated tomato species,
Solanum chilense. We have shown that populations show
dierent levels of defence against a range of pathogens
and have identied patterns of dierential selection for
defence-associated genes. However, the implications of
these ndings on a molecular level remain unknown.
Therefore, we are looking for an enthusiastic PhD stu-
dent to investigate the diversity of secondary metabolites
in S. chilense and the eects thereof on plant defence
mechanisms in an evolutionary context. The applicant
must have a very good MSc in biology, biotechnology or
(bio)chemistry with an interest in evolutionary biology.
Knowledge and practical experience in biochemistry,
molecular plant sciences and an interest in bioinformat-
ics and population genetics are required. English skills,
both written and spoken, are essential.June 1, 2019 EvolDir 41
The project will be carried out in the group of Dr.
Remco Stam at the Chair of Phytopathology (Prof.
Dr. Ralph H ~A^A1
4ckelhoven). The chair hosts several
research groups studying molecular biology of plant
pathogens and is well equipped to study pathogen de-
fence responses on dierent levels. The project will be
carried out in collaboration with the Bavarian Center
for Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry (BayBioMS) and
the Chair for Experimental Bioinformatics, both located
on campus. The project is integrated into the SFB924
\Molecular mechanisms regulating yield and yield stabil-
ity in plants", allowing direct access to state of the art
technology for cell biological and biochemical analysis,
next generation sequencing etc.

The laboratory of professor Prof. Dr. Siegfried Roth,
at the Institute of Zoology of the Albertus-Magnus Uni-
versity of Cologne, Germany, is oering a 3-year PhD
position. Salary according to German TV-L E13 (65%).
Background: Chelicerates are the most basally branch-
ing clade of the arthropods, and include horseshoe crabs,
sea spiders and arachnids (e.g. spiders and scorpions).June 1, 2019 EvolDir 43
Embryonic development of this group of animals is of
special interest as they have evolved a very interesting
mode of setting up the dorsoventral body axis. This
mode involves the establishment of an organizer (called
the cumulus) that is analogous to the organizers that
can be found in vertebrate embryos (e.g. Spemann or-
ganizer of amphibian embryos). Similar to organizer
transplantations in vertebrate embryos, transplantation
of the cumulus is able to induce axis duplication in spi-
der embryos. The projects aims to better understand
anteroposterior and dorsoventral body-axis formation
in chelicerates as well as the formation, patterning and
migration of the cumulus. The project will involve next
generation sequencing, antibody generation, knockdown
and overexpression studies in the common house spider
Parasteatoda tepidariorum.
Your prole: We are looking for a committed, talented
and highly motivated PhD candidate with a MSc or
an equivalent university degree in biology or a related
discipline. The candidate should have a strong back-
ground/interest in evolutionary biology. Excellent com-
munication and writing skills in English are essential.
Experience in handling and imaging embryos of arthro-
pod species as well as being experienced in molecular bi-
ological techniques like gene cloning, performing protein
overexpression and Western Blots would be benecial.

WaspEvolutionaryGenetics
Open PhD position in Evolutionary Genetics & Analyt-
ical Chemistry
The Molecular Evolutionary Biology and Chemical Com-
munication group at the Institute for Evolution and
Biodiversity at the University of M'nster, Germany, are
looking to ll a PhD Position (TV-L E13, 65%) for the
research project:
Genetic, chemical and behavioral investigation of sexual
signaling evolution in parasitoid wasps
The xed-term position is available for three years and
will begin on the 1st of September 2019 or as soon
as possible. One of the most important questions in
evolutionary biology is how new species potentially orig-
inate. The development and maintenance of barriers to
interspecic reproduction has been postulated to be the
major driving force of speciation. Variations in sexual
signaling have the potential to greatly contribute to keep
species reproductively isolated through species-specic
communication and recognition mechanisms. In the
insect model system Nasonia, a closely related species
complex of parasitoid jewel wasps, we could demonstratethat female cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) function as
species-specic sex pheromones distinguishable by the
males, hinting at their profound role in reproductive
isolation. Curiously though, in one particular Nasonia
species (N. giraulti), an apparently recent evolutionary
leap shifted the female CHC prole out of the males'
perceptive range, which, in turn, still retain a poten-
tially ancestral attraction to CHC proles of females
from other species. In this PhD project, the successful
candidate will have the unique opportunity to track this
highly unusual evolutionary shift genetically, chemically
and behaviorally with the ultimate goal to unravel the
key compounds responsible for maintaining the sexual
signaling function in Nasonia CHC proles. The PhD
candidate will establish female sipship lines based on
Nasonia hybrids to enable the performance of haploid
genetics on Nasonia males to assess dierential pheno-
typic traits in the diploid Nasonia females. The sexual
attractiveness of the resulting hybrid female sibship lines
will be simultaneously accessed by our established male
mate choice assays as well as gas-chromatographic cou-
pled with tandem mass spectrometric analysis of their
corresponding CHC proles, utilizing our new, state-of-
the-art GC-MS/MS set-up. Furthermore, the successful
candidate is expected to generate a high-density genomic
map based on novel Restriction-site Associated DNA
(RAD) sequencing for localizing quantitative trait loci
(QTL) governing CHC variation in the hybrid female
sipship lines. To conrm their function, the unraveled
candidate gene regions co-localizing with our predicted
QTL for CHC variation and female attractiveness will
be selectively knocked down in the parental Nasonia fe-
males utilizing double-stranded RNA interference (dsR-
NAi). Lastly, the successful knockdown in the Nasonia
females needs to be conrmed behaviorally (male mate
choice assays), chemically (GC-MS/MS) and genetically
(qPCR), for unambiguously revealing the crucial com-
ponents and mechanisms governing the sexual signaling
function in Nasonia CHC proles. The successful PhD
candidate will be supervised by Dr. Jan Buellesbach and
integrated into the newly established Chemical Com-
munication within the larger framework of Molecular
Evolutionary Biology headed by Prof. Dr. J'rgen Gadau.
The PhD student will also have the chance to join the
M'nster Graduate School of Evolution, one of the largest
graduate programs in evolutionary biology in Germany.
Requirements: Applicants are required to have a mas-
ter's or equivalent degree in biology, chemistry or a
related eld. Applicants are also expected to show a
strong interest in evolutionary biology, functional genet-
ics and genomics as well as analytical chemistry. Expe-
rience with genomic mapping techniques, particularly
RAD-sequencing and QTL mapping as well as func-46 EvolDir June 1, 2019
tional genetics approaches such as dsRNAi and qPCR
are highly desirable. Furthermore, high motivation to be
trained in state-of-the-art gas-chromatography coupled
with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) analysis
and behavioral mate choice assays will be expected from
the potential candidates as well. Other requirements
are the capacity to eectively integrate several multi-
variate datasets, formulate and solve individual research
questions, motivation to conduct research independently
and nally, uency in written and spoken English.
The University of M'nster is an equal opportunity em-
ployer and is committed to increasing the proportion
of women in academics. Consequently, we actively en-
courage applications by women. Female candidates with

PhenotypicPlasticityAgeing
We have a PhD position (or two) at the Evolu-
tion & Ecology Research Centre at UNSW (http://-
www.eerc.unsw.edu.au/)
Title: Phenotypic plasticity and aging in a changing
world
Abstract: Human-induced changes such as clmate
change threaten many populations. Evidence suggests
that for many organisms, an increase in temperature
expedites aging. Importantly, aging is often associated
with the loss of phenotypic plasticity, key for popula-
tion viability in a changing world. Surprisingly, we
know very little about how plasticity changes as organ-
isms age. This project will ll this knowledge gap on
age-dependent plasticity using both theoretical and em-
pirical approaches. Our project will reveal not only how
phenotypic plasticity can dampen the eect of climate
change, but also how, in turn, climate change itself can
aect phenotypic plasticity.Candidate: We are looking for a candidate with a back-
ground in ecology and evolution, so they are familiar
with the theory and literature, although a candidate
with a background in mathematics, statistics and com-
puter sciences is also suitable. Ideally, a candidate
should have some experience in empirical work (e.g.
having conducted a eld or lab experiment of their own)
and good quantitative and computational skills (e.g.
basic knowledge of linear algebra, competence in R).
Also, we seek a demonstrated ability in academic com-

UParis13 TermitePhylogeography
A PhD position is available for 3 years at the Labora-
tory of Experimental and Comparative Ethology (LEEC,
University Paris 13, France).
Phylogeography of the Neotropical soil-feeding termite
Embiratermes neotenicus (Termitidae, Syntermitinae)
in South America
Soil-feeding species occur in several lineages of Termi-
tidae (most evolved termite family) and represent over
one-third of all described termite species. Soil feeders
are especially abundant and diversied in humid trop-
ical forests, where they largely contribute to the soil
humication process. It was proposed that soil feeders
were poor passive dispersers over water gaps because
their colonies are usually located in the soil or soil-made
nests and are unlikely to raft over water gaps, contrary
to wood feeders frequently drifting in wood pieces. Up
to date, only two genetic study investigated the disper-
sal potential of alates in soil feeders in pristine habitats,
i.e. Fournier et al. (2016) in Cavitermes tuberosus and
Fougeyrollas et al. (2018) in Embiratermes neotenicus
and Silvestritermes minutus. Beside their typical soil-
feeding ecology, our interest in these two last species
was further prompted by their unusual breeding system:
asexual queen succession. In this system, the found-
ing primary queen is replaced by numerous neotenic
daughters arising through thelytokous parthenogene-
sis. The neotenics then take over the reproduction of
the colony and mate with the founder king. While the
breeding system of E. neotenicus is now well known, the
reproduction of colonies, i.e. the dispersal and mating
strategies, remain to be investigated at a large scale, i.e.
in South America where this species occurs. Therefore,
we aim to study population genetics and phylogeogra-
phy (i.e. study of the principles and processes governing
the geographical distributions of genealogical lineages,
including those at the intraspecic level) of Embirater-
mes neotenicus in South America. Molecular analyses
will be performed on samples collected in many dier-ent countries from South America. This will allow us:
(1) to determine whether it includes genetically and
geographically distinct lineages, (2) to elucidate its de-
mographic history (diversication events), (3) to infer
biogeographic scenarios.
We are seeking a highly motivated candidate with a
Master degree in a relevant area (ethology, behavioral
ecology, genetics or entomology). We expect successful
candidates to write scientic papers on the project in in-
ternationally peer-reviewed journals, and to present the
research at national and international meetings. Work-
ing language is French or English. Possibility of doing
teaching in French only.

*PhD-position in Animal Evolution at Uppsala Univer-

A 4-year PhD-position in evolutionary genetics is avail-

the Department of Ecology and Evolution, Animal Ecol-48 EvolDir June 1, 2019
ogy in Uppsala, Sweden. Starting date in September
2019 or as agreed upon.
Project description: Earth is permeated by a remark-
ably rich ora and fauna, from the highest mountains
to the deepest seas and lakes. Unfortunately, biological
diversity is disappearing at a fast and accelerating pace.
To preserve the biological diversity it is important to un-
derstand the two ways that underlie changes in species
diversity: extinction and speciation. So far, most stud-
ies have been focused on understanding mechanisms of
extinction, since speciation traditionally has been seen
as a slow process that 'only adds new species to the
existing ones'. Recent research eorts challenge this
picture and require that we reassess the roles of both
speciation and extinction in generation and maintenance
of biodiversity. Speciation can occur quickly, especially
when the process acts in reverse ' i.e. where a new
species develops from two parental species through hy-
bridization. In this project, we aim to characterize and
quantify mechanisms that aect how species boundaries
dissolve in freshwater lakes. Particular focus will be on
the common bream and the white bream (Abramis sp.),
two closely related freshwater sh species that currently
hybridize to some extent and that run the risk of collaps-
ing into a single unit (gene-pool). The PhD project will
contain a range of approaches including genetic studies,
eld and lab experiments and mathematical modelling.

biodiversity in Swedish freshwater lakes.

Vienna TreePathogenInteractions
PhD position in tree breeding and genomics of tree-
pathogen interactions
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD candidate with
background in evolutionary biology and genetics having
a special focus on tree-pathogen interactions. The po-
sition is for 3 years (full-time) and the working place
will be the Federal Research and Training Centre for
Forests (BFW) in Vienna, Austria.
Project description: Diplodia sapinea or Diplodia tip
blight is an important pathogen aecting economically
valuable pine species around the world. As an endo-
phyte in many pines, it can quickly develop into a severe
disease especially when trees become drought stressed
in summer. Hence, it is considered an important biotic
disturbance agent under climate change. However, the
genomic architecture of resistance against Diplodia tipblight is largely unexplored yet. The aim of the project
is i) to get a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms leading to resistance and ii) to nd genetic
variants and phenotypes that can be employed in breed-
ing programs in order to produce more resilient seed
material. The candidate will work on whole-genome
sequencing information (Exome-capture) as well as on
metabolomic data. The model tree species is Black Pine
(Pinus nigra), which is occurring in an area of 20,000ha
in eastern Austria. In the project, we will combine in-
fection experiments of clonal copies of Black Pine trees
with eld sampling and landscape genomic approaches.
Requirements: The candidate should have a completed
Master degree in biology, genetics or plant biotechnology
with outstanding rating. Experience with tree and/or
fungal DNA is an advantage. Knowledge of program-
ming in R or other related software languages is also
benecial. A high level of reliability and an accurate
mode of working is absolutely desirable for this project
The Federal Research and Training Centre for Forests
(BFW) is located in the heart of Vienna close to the
castle of Sch onbrunn in a nice and green working envi-
ronment. The candidate will work in an international
team and will also partly work in the labs of collabo-
rating partner institutions in Vienna. We oer a gross
monthly salary of e2.718,90 (14 times per year).
The position will start in October 2019 and appli-
cants should send their CV together with a Let-
ter of motivation (all in one pdf-document named
as Surname Name CV.pdf) until July 31st to jan-
peter.george@bfw.gv.at Contact details of two academic
reference persons should also be given in the CV. Can-
didates selected for a Skype interview will be informed
latest until beginning of September.

The Social Savannah: studying cooperation and conict
in southern African birds
We are looking for eld research assistants to work on
our wild bird study in Mbuluzi Game Reserve, Eswa-
tini (formerly Swaziland). This work is part of an on-
going project to monitor the reproductive and social
behaviours of a number of bird species including speck-
led mousebirds, arrow-marked babblers, white-crested
helmet shrikes and dark-capped bulbuls. Fieldwork
involves catching and ringing individuals and taking bi-
ological samples (during the non-breeding season), and
nding and monitoring nesting attempts (in the breed-
ing season). Field assistants will also be responsible for
tasks like data management and vegetation/arthropod
surveys.
Field assistants will be stationed at the reserves research
centre as part of a small collaborative research team
from the Universities of Groningen and Wageningen in
the Netherlands, and the University of eSwatini. The
eld base is in a remote but beautiful location and oers
basic sanitary facilities, a research station, and clean
but basic tented accommodation and food.
Most of the eldwork is conducted by mountain bike or
car V a valid driving licence is therefore needed and some
experience driving on poor roads or dirt tracks would
be a bonus (but not strictly required). Fieldwork at our
study site is physically demanding, so applicants must
be physically t and able to cope in harsh conditions.
Applicants are expected to work both independently
and as part of a group, and experience of catching and
observing wild birds would be a strong advantage. Theposition oers lots of opportunities to learn and practice
important research and data collection skills and the
chance to collaborate on projects covering a range of
topics including parental care, endocrinology and so-
ciality. There are also opportunities for eld assistants
to conduct their own small research projects as part of
ongoing data collection.
The position will run from July to December 2019. A
six month stay is preferable but we will consider all
applicants than can stay for at least three months. The
costs of accommodation and food will be covered for
the duration of the position.
We are looking to ll this position quickly and will stop
reviewing applications once a suitable candidate has
been found, so we encourage potential candidates to
get in touch ASAP. To apply, please send a cover letter
explaining your suitability for the project, along with
a CV, to the email address below. We look forward to
hearing from you!

CallForSubmissions
***We invite contributions to a special feature on evo-
lution in urban environments to be published in Evo-
lutionary Applications in 2020. Instructions on how
to be considered for this special feature are provided76 EvolDir June 1, 2019
below. This information is also available at: https://-
urbanevolution-litc.com/evoapp submission/ ***
Urban areas are among the fastest growing ecosystems
on earth and the driver of local and global climate
change. Despite this importance, little is known about
the consequences of urbanization for evolutionary bi-
ology, and its application to human society and envi-
ronmental sustainability. Consequently, the study of
evolution in urban environments is among the fastest
growing research areas in evolutionary biology, with
important implications for fundamental questions in
evolutionary biology and applied problems that relate
to human health, conservation biology, environmental
sustainability, and urban planning. To advance this
research area, Evolutionary Applications will be hosting
a Special Issue examining how urbanization aects the
evolution of organisms living in or near cities, edited
by Marc Johnson, Elizabeth Carlen, Lindsay Miles, and
Kristin Winchell.
To be considered for the special issue, we invite Ab-
stract submissions that propose original theoretical or
empirical research, quantitative reviews/meta-analyses
or perspective articles that oer a novel view on ur-
ban evolution. Contributions from diverse and cross-
disciplinary elds are especially encouraged. We also
encourage submissions from any country and research
discipline. Papers should examine the eects of ur-
banization on evolution, or the applied consequences
of urban evolution on urban planning and sustainabil-
ity, conservation, genetics, human evolution, and the
integration of ecological and applied research with an
evolutionary perspective. Abstract submissions should
be 250-400 words and can be submitted using this form:
https://forms.gle/9BdwShrQz29MNh1j9. The deadline
for abstract submissions is June 1st, 2019, and all deci-
sions on invited papers will be communicated by July 1.
Invited contributors should plan to submit manuscripts
for peer review by February 1, 2020.

\Winchell, Kristin" <kmwinchell@wustl.edu >Genes CytonuclearInteractionsIssue
Please note that there will be a special issue on cytonu-
clear interactions in polyploid organisms in the journal
Genes:
Manuscripts are due September 30th 2019
https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes/special issues/-
polyploid species? Polyploidy is widespread in
plants and less frequent in animals but serves as
an important speciation mechanism in both groups.
Polyploidy is accompanied by drastic changes in
genome organization including dierential patterns
of gene loss, gene silencing, genome-wide expression
dominance, and epigenetic reprogramming. One
underexplored dimension of polyploid evolution is
cytonuclear interactions. Allopolyploid animals must
ensure coordination between the eectively haploid
and typically uniparentally inherited mitochondrial
genome and the duplicated biparentally inherited
nuclear genome. In allopolyploid plants, an additional
cytoplasmic genome (the plastome) must interact
with the duplicated nuclear genome. Whole genome
duplication may lead to a stochiometric imbalance
between these interacting genomes and perturb
the assembly of enzyme complexes and the proper
functioning of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Recent
studies have shown compensatory mechanisms in young
plant polyploids with organelle-targeting nuclear genes
returning to a single copy following polyploidization. In
animals, the mitochondrial genome is typically inherited
maternally and numerous cases of hybrid breakdown
and incompatibilities have been traced to the disruption
of cytonuclear coordination in diploids. However, not
much is known about how doubling the nuclear genome
perturbs interactions with the mitochondrial genome in
polyploid animals or plants. As polyploidy allows new
interactions between highly divergent cytoplasmic and
nuclear genomes, cytonuclear interactions may be more
challenging in allopolyploids than in diploid hybrids.
This Special Issue aims to explore and contrast coordi-
nation and coevolution between cytoplasmic and nuclear
genomes in both plant and animal polyploids.

nominations-open-for-the-2019-harry-smith-prize/ >
The editorial board of the journal *Molecular Ecology
*is seeking nominations for the Harry Smith Prize, which
recognizes the best paper published in *Molecular Ecol-
ogy*in the previous year by graduate students or early
career scholars with no more than ve years of postdoc-
toral or fellowship experience. The prize comes with
a cash award of US $1000 and an announcement in the
journal and in the Molecular Ecologist. The winner will
also be asked to join a junior editorial board for the
journal to oer advice on changing research needs and
potentially serve as a guest editor. The winner of this
annual prize is selected by the junior editorial board.
The prize is named after Professor Harry Smith FRS,
who founded *Molecular Ecology* and served as both
Chief and Managing Editor during the journal's critical
early years. He continued as the journal's Managing Ed-
itor until 2008, and he went out of his way to encourage
early career scholars. In addition to his editorial work,
Harry was one of the world's foremost researchers in
photomorphogenesis, where he determined how plants
respond to shading, leading to concepts such as 'neigh-
bour detection' and 'shade avoidance,' which are funda-
mental to understanding plant responses to crowding
and competition. More broadly his research provided an
early example of how molecular data could inform ecol-
ogy, and in 2008 he was awarded the Molecular Ecology
Prize that recognized both his scientic and editorial
contributions to the eld.
Please send a PDF of the paper you are nominating,
with a short supporting statement (no more than 250
words; longer submissions will not be accepted) directly

Post-doctoral position in animal ecological genomics
is available at the CIBIO/InBio, Research Centre
in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources, University of
Porto, Portugal (https://cibio.up.pt/), to work with the
BIODESERTS team (https://biodeserts.cibio.up.pt/).
Successful applicant will coordinate laboratory work and
bioinformatical analyses at CIBIO/InBio, in close collab-
oration and visits at University of Oulu (*https://bit.ly/-

bit.ly/2ATA69P*). Candidate will have the opportunity
to participation in eld work in North Africa (*https:/-
/goo.gl/H1gptJ*) investigating unique desert rodents.
This project investigates the eect of past climatic
changes on the genomic architecture of adaptation us-
ing Sahara desert specialist, jerboa *Jaculus jaculus*.
Since the formation of the Sahara, during the Mid-
Upper Pliocene, the region went through several climate
changes. Those changes inuenced habitat structure of
recently described cryptic species within jerboa. Dis-
covery of divergence in fur coloration and camouage
lead to the hypothesis that jerboa species specialized to
explore divergent habitats. In this project we ask: what
is the role of climate changes in shaping the genomic
architecture of adaptations to extreme desert conditions,
camouage and habitat specialization?
Funding is available for up to 32 months with renewal
after rst year of satisfactory performance. Salarylevel is according to the Portuguese state foundation

DEEP: Deforestation and Evolutionary Ecology of
Pathogens - Impacts of anthropogenic pressures on bird
populations and infectious diseases in an insular context
Oceanic islands, by virtue of their simplicity, played a
central role in the development of ecological and evo-
lutionary theory. They constitute hotspots of both en-June 1, 2019 EvolDir 83
demism, due to their isolation, and extinction, due to the
increasing human impacts. To date, little is known on
how anthropogenic changes inuence the host-parasite
interactions on islands and especially the distribution of
parasites in endemic populations. Among the numerous
anthropogenic pressures, agricultural expansion is one
of the principal factors contributing to deforestation
in tropical regions and in recent years, the cultivation
of one crop, oil palm *Elaeis guineensis*, has been ex-
panding at an annual rate of 9% worldwide. This rapid
expansion has resulted in a signicant loss of biodiver-
sity across the tropics for various taxa: arthropods,
birds, mammals and associated ecosystem services, but
surprisingly very few studies investigated the eects
of forest conversion to oil palm plantations on vectors
and vector-borne diseases. This project will address
this gap by using cutting-edge molecular technologies
and a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together
epidemiology, vector ecology and immunoecology on an
endemic-rich oceanic island, S~ ao Tom e in the Gulf of
Guinea, Africa. The outcomes of the project will be of
direct relevance not only for the conservation biology
but also for the understanding of the dynamics of infec-
tious diseases in a rapidly changing world - a subject of
major implications for human health.

The phenotype is an important determinant of the dy-
namic interactions between ecological and evolutionary
processes. We are looking for a highly motivated Post-
doctoral candidate to study the interplay among ECO,
EVO and DEVO including 1) the dual role of ecology in
evolution (as driver of natural selection and phenotypicplasticity), 2) the molecular mechanisms underlying phe-
notypic variation, and 3) the feedbacks between pheno-
typic change and ecosystem function (eco-evolutionary
dynamics). The project uses threespine stickleback
(*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) from lake M ~A^A1
2vatn, Ice-
land, as a model. The project is led by Prof. Bjarni
K. Kristj ~A^Ansson (lead PI, H ~A^A3lar University Col-

eld) and genomics tools (transcriptomics and genomics)
with mathematical modelling. The postdoctoral fellow
will have opportunities to develop the focus of their
work, will be encouraged to further develop their re-
search career, e.g. by opportunities in developing spin
o projects, and through student supervision.
*Location*: The candidate will be based at the Dept. of
Aquaculture and Fish Biology (DAFB - http://holar.is/-

InsectSymbioses
Postdoctoral Researcher position: The evolutionary dy-
namics of insect symbioses
The new Symbiosis Evolution research group
(www.symbioses.pl) at the Institute of Environmental
Sciences of Jagiellonian University ( www.eko.uj.edu.pl)
in Krakow, Poland, is looking to hire a Postdoctoral
Researcher. This is a full-time, 48-month position
funded by the Polish National Science Centre (NCN)
project \The evolutionary dynamics of the symbioses of
Auchenorrhyncha", available from Summer 2019.
The project goal is to comprehensively describe the evo-88 EvolDir June 1, 2019
lutionary processes and patterns related to nutritional
endosymbioses in a clade of sap-feeding hemipteran in-
sects that includes cicadas, spittlebugs, leafhoppers, tree-
hoppers, and planthoppers. In particular, the project
will focus on the replacements of ancient heritable sym-
bionts by other microorganisms that occurred in dif-
ferent Auchenorrhyncha clades. We will describe the
incidence and nature of these symbiont replacements,
the origins of the replacing microbes, their genomic
evolutionary patterns, their biological roles, and the
eects of the replacements on the ecology and evolu-
tion of hosts. We will achieve this through microbiome
screens and reconstructions of the symbiont replacement
patterns across the global auchenorrhynchan diversity,
followed by phylogenomic, comparative genomic, and
microscopy-based analyses of symbionts in host clades
that have experienced the replacements.
The Postdoc will play the central role in this project and
contribute to most aspects. Early on, they will partici-
pate in the planning and implementation of molecular
and bioinformatic techniques for the microbiome sur-
vey across large numbers of samples, as well as the
acquisition and management of insect specimens. Later,
depending on expertise and interests, they may lead
the reconstruction of the diversity and evolution of sym-
bioses across Auchenorrhyncha clades and species, or
focus on phylogenomic, comparative genomic, and func-
tional analyses of symbiotic bacteria and fungi. They
will also have an opportunity to contribute to the study
of other aspects of insect symbioses.
The Postdoc will be based at one of the top research
institutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolution in Cen-
tral Europe, in a medieval city known as the cultural
capital of Poland, with good access to outdoor recre-
ation opportunities and well-connected to the rest of
Europe. They will be encouraged to spend time in the
laboratories of international collaborators. We oer a
competitive salary relative to the cost of living, exi-
ble schedules, and extensive opportunities to acquire
cutting-edge research skills and to network.
The candidates must have a Ph.D. in Biological Sci-
ences or a related eld, or anticipate the completion of
doctoral studies before the appointment starts. They
should be able to demonstrate experience with molec-
ular biology techniques and bioinformatic analyses of
NGS data and be uent in English. An ideal candi-
date will be able to demonstrate interest and scientic
achievements related to the planned project, for example
regarding the Auchenorrhyncha biology; the diversity,
biology, and evolution of insect-microbe interactions; mi-
crobiome surveys; comparative microbial genomics, and
phylogenomics. Familiarity with the Linux / Unix shell
and scripting languages such as Python / Perl / R, andinterest in participating in international collaborations
and research travel preferred.

ButteryEvolutionaryGenomics
2-year Postdoc on the genomics of supergene evolution
in butteries - CNRS Montpellier, France
A 2-year post-doctoral fellowship is available at the
CNRS Centre for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology
(CEFE) in Montpellier, France, to work on the evolu-tionary genomics and demography of inversion polymor-
phism in tropical butteries with Dr Mathieu Joron and
colleagues (http://joron.cefe.cnrs.fr).
Full ad: http://bit.ly/2Jz565A Closing date: 20 June
2019
Supergenes are genetic architectures underlying the coor-
dinated variation of many characters within populations.
Supergenes are often associated with chromosomal re-
arrangements and with specic genomic signatures of
natural selection. Our lab focuses on a complex of
distinct chromosomal types characterized by distinct
combinations of inversions, and associated with wing-
pattern mimicry polymorphism, in the tropical buttery
Heliconius numata. The project aims at understanding
the consequences of supergene formation by dissecting
the traits and population parameters aected by chromo-
somal polymorphism. The position is open to contribute
to understanding how inversions have established and
spread through populations across the range, how in-
version polymorphism involves deleterious mutations,
changes in mating systems, and shifts in population con-
nectivity, which may profoundly change ecological and
evolutionary trajectories of polymorphic populations.
The postdoctoral researcher will be in charge of popu-
lation genomic approaches. She or he will investigate
signatures of selection, genomic association of tness
traits, as well as population demography and dierentia-
tion across the range. Datasets such as 120 resequenced
genomes, multiple independent genome assemblies, tran-
scriptomes and annotations are available, and will be
expanded during the project. The project allows for
much exibility in the direction taken, for instance by
combining population genomics with eld or morpho-
metric data, depending on the postdocs interests and
ideas.
The postdoc will join a lively consortium of teams whose
research combines experimental/trait-based approaches
and population genomics (CEFE Montpellier), bioin-
formatics (Claire Lemaitre, INRIA Rennes), and evolu-
tionary theory (Violaine Llaurens, MNHN Paris). The
postdoc will interact with team members working on
the ecology of inversion polymorphism, the modelling of
balancing selection, or the functional dissection of wing-
patterning. Our partner institution INRIA Genscale
is a major bioinformatics institute in Rennes, so the
postdoc will enjoy direct support from a bioinformatics
team.
Candidates should have a PhD or equivalent in evo-
lutionary sciences, advanced knowledge of population
genetic theory, a keen interest in understanding biodiver-
sity. Candidates should have experience with genomic
datasets, population genomics and/or demographic infer-92 EvolDir June 1, 2019
ences using genomic data. Experience with heterozygous
genomes, inversion polymorphisms, and/or the mapping
of complex phenotypes will be appreciated.
Starting date is exible but should ideally be in the
autumn 2019. Net salary: between 25 k/year and 35
k/year depending on experience, including social bene-
ts and public health insurance.
The CEFE is the largest ecology lab in France and is
a major institute for evolutionary ecology and genetics.
Within CEFE, our team comprises 12 researchers whose
research combines genetics and evolutionary ecology to
address a diversity of topics on adaptation and natural
variation. Our group focuses on buttery wing patterns
as a model to decipher how diversity is shaped by nat-
ural selection and other processes at the phenotypic
and genomic level. Montpellier is a major hotspot for
evolutionary and environmental research worldwide and
has a vibrant research community with several hundred
researchers in this domain, and highly praised gradu-
ate programmes. The University of Montpellier ranked
1st in the 2018 Shanghai ranking in Ecology. Montpel-
lier lies near the Mediterranean region in the South of
France and enjoys pleasant weather, fantastic nature
and great cultural and city life..
Applications should be done through the CNRS portal.

a letter of application with details on their motivation
and achievements and including proposed research di-
rections, a full CV, the names and contact details of
two references, and their date of availability. Closing

NewYorkU EvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral position in Matt Rockman's Lab in New
York
Join us at NYU to work on fundamental questions in
evolutionary genetics. We're studying the characteris-
tics, causes, and consequences of segregating recessive
variation in natural populations. The study organism is
an obligately-outcrossing worm closely related to C. ele-
gans, chosen because populations harbor intermediate
levels of recessive deleterious variation, convenient for
experimental and genomic analyses.
The postdoctoral researcher would have opportunities
to analyze datasets we have generated from laboratory
evolution experiments and broad latitude to develop
new datasets or conduct new experiments.
This position is ideal for someone with experience or
interests in statistical genetics, quantitative genetics,
population genetics, comparative genomics, or experi-
mental evolution. The position can t anywhere on the
computational-experimental spectrum according to the
researcher's goals and background.
The Rockman Lab studies evolutionary genetics, with a
focus on the relationship between developmental mech-
anisms and population-level phenotypic variation and
evolution. NYU is home to a number of evolution and
comparative genomics research groups, and the New
York area is increasingly a center for evolutionary genet-

at the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo. The
position is placed in the ?Sex and Evolution Research
Group? (SERG). The appointment is a fulltime posi-
tion and is made for a period of four years with 25 %
duty work devoted to teaching, supervision, collection
management (curatorial work in the ornithological col-
lection of NHM), outreach activities and administration.
The postdoctoral fellow is expected to acquire basic
pedagogical competency in the course of the fellowship
period within the duty component of 25 %. The main
purpose of the fellowship is to qualify researchers for
work in higher academic positions within their disci-
plines.Starting date no later than 01.10.2019.
More about the position The position is placed in the
Sex and Evolution Research Group (SERG). The re-
search group currently consists of two professors, two
researchers and two PhD-students, as well as master
students. The research themes are concentrated on
the importance of sex, sex roles and sexual conict
in shaping evolutionary processes such as speciation,
hybridization, diversication and adaptation. These
processes are studied at dierent levels of organization,
like genes, genomes, gametes, individuals, populations
and species. Most projects use birds as their study sys-
tems. The research group has access to large museum
collections in ornithology, including a unique collection
of formalin-preserved sperm cells from more than 500
species, and a DNA bank with more than 50 000 bird
tissue samples. Field work for comparative studies is
often carried out abroad and in collaboration with other
institutions and research groups.94 EvolDir June 1, 2019
We invite a highly motivated researcher to work on
and develop a project entitled ?Macroevolution of avian
spermatozoa? in close collaboration with the scientic
sta in the SERG group. The project will consist of
three main parts, (1) a descriptive analysis of the ma-
jor patterns of sperm phenotype dierentiation across
the passerine phylogeny, (2) analyses of evolutionary
rates of sperm variation among and within lineages, and
(3) investigation of the genomic mechanisms underlying
sperm trait evolution. The approach will be largely phy-
logenetically controlled comparative analyses combined
with in-depth phylogenomics of selected taxa. There
will also be a need for additional eld work to sample
important taxa currently lacking in our sperm database.
Qualication requirements The candidate must have a
PhD in ecology, evolution or avian systematics. We seek
a highly competent and motivated early career evolution-
ary biologist, with skills in comparative analyses and evo-
lutionary modelling and experience with bioinformatic
tools for handling large genomic data sets. Experience
with ornithological eld work and good knowledge in
bird systematics is required, while experience with work
on spermatozoa, including microscopy and morphome-
try, and other natural history collection work, will be
considered advantageous. A good command of written
and spoken English is required.

Post-doc position in Evolutionary quantitative genetics,
NTNU, Trondheim Norway
We have a fully-funded 3 year Post-doc position in
evolutionary biology available at the Centre for Biodi-
versity Dynamics, NTNU (Trondheim, Norway). The
Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics is a leading cross-
disciplinary Centre of Excellence from the Norwegian
Research Council, with primary interests in evolutionary
biology, population ecology and community dynamics.
It works at the interface between biology and mathe-
matical sciences and strives to apply cutting-edge theo-
retical and statistical frameworks to eld data to resolve
key questions in the context of both fundamental and
applied sciences. Further information is available at
http://www.ntnu.edu/cbd About the position
The post-doc position is part of a project nanced by the
Norwegian Research Council on evolvability. In brief,
evolvability is the ability of organisms to respond to
selection. On short time-scales, evolvability depends on
the amount of additive genetic variance. Yet, evolvabil-
ity, variation in evolvability and the factors responsible
for this variation are poorly understood. To improve
our understanding of evolvability, we will synthesize
the empirical knowledge on additive genetic variance
and identify key factors aecting this property of liv-
ing organism by performing quantitative reviews and
meta-analyses of published results on evolvability. More
specically, we will investigate questions such as: Does
variation in life history strategy aect evolvability? Does
environmental uctuation increase evolvability? Ulti-
mately, we will build a large open-access data base on
evolvability. Using newly developed statistical meth-
ods to analyze line-cross data, we will also investigate
the importance of epistatic interactions in quantitative
traits. The post-doc will work with Professor C. P elabon
at NTNU, Professor T.F. Hansen (University of Oslo),
and senior researcher G.H. Bolstad (NINA, Trondheim).
Part of the work during the rst years of the post-doc
will be located in Oslo.
Job description
The main tasks of the post-doc will be to gather infor-
mation from the literature with the rest of the team96 EvolDir June 1, 2019
and analyze these data to test specic hypotheses about
the factors aecting evolvability. The post-doc is thus
expected to lead part of the project and develop his/her
own research questions within the general framework of
the project. We thus seek candidates highly motivated
for theoretical work and data analysis with a broad
understanding of the evolutionary theory.
Qualication requirements
We seek candidates who have a strong academic record
and interests in evolutionary theory and quantitative
genetics. The candidate must have a PhD degree in
biology preferably related to evolutionary biology or
quantitative genetics, but candidates with a background
in statistics may be also considered for the position.
Other desired qualications:
Good competences in statistical genetics.
Strong interest for the theory.
Willingness to learn and extend new forms of statistical
and/or mathematical analyses.
Good theoretical knowledge of relevant topics in evolu-
tionary biology and quantitative genetics such as the
multivariate Lande equation, epistasis, genetic architec-
ture.
Some experience of meta-analytical work and work with
large data-base would be an advantage.
Good skills in written and oral English.
The candidate should present excellent ability for team-
work, but should be also able to work independently.
We are seeking innovative candidates that are able to
generate their own research questions within the frame-
work of the project.

*Project description* The positions are associated with
the European Research Council (ERC) funded project
SuperGenE: Supergene evolution in a classic plant sys-
tem - genomic studies of distyly.
The aim of this project is to investigate the genomic ar-
chitecture underlying the balanced oral polymorphism
termed distyly in wild Linum species. Specically, the
project aims to investigate the genomic region (termed
supergene) that governs distyly and test whether this su-
pergene exhibits evolutionary genetic similarities to sex
chromosomes. For this purpose, we are conducting evo-
lutionary genetic analyses of cutting-edge genomic data
to comprehensively investigate the tempo and mode of
recombination suppression, the impact of natural selec-
tion, and regulatory evolution at the supergene in several
distylous species. Within the project we are generating
several new high-quality de novo genome assemblies for
wild Linum species, as well as large population genomics
and expression data sets.
The positions will be based in the Slotte lab (https:/-
/tanjaslottelab.se), a part of the Dept. of Ecology,
Environment and Plant Science, Stockholm University
(http://su.se/deep/english/). The working atmosphere
is international with English as the working language,
and the position oers plenty of opportunities for sci-
entic exchange with both genomicists, evolutionary
biologists and ecologists.
*Qualication requirements* A relevant PhD degree and
training in evolutionary genetics or population genomics
is required. For the postdoctoral position the PhD de-
gree must have been completed no more than three years
before the deadline (see full ad for details). Candidates
who do not meet this requirement should instead apply
for the researcher position.
*Main responsibilities* The positions involve researchin the ERC project SuperGenE, primarily evolutionary
genetic analyses of genomic data and gene expression
data. Some lab work and plant work (e.g. sampling of
natural populations in the Mediterranean region) may
also be included.

UBritishColumbia 2 PlantEvolution
The Davies lab at the University of British Columbia is
advertising two funded postdoctoral positions
*A phylogenetic framework for the macroecology of plant
disease*
Applications are invited for a fully funded one-year post-
doctoral position, starting September 2019 with possi-
bility of extension, on the development of a phylogenetic
framework for the macroecology of plant diseases that
merges theory with phylogenetic, spatial and trait-based
approaches.
Project Description
Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) represent one of thesingle biggest threats to humans, wildlife, and domes-
ticated plants and animals. Traditional approaches for
modelling infectious disease dynamics have assumed
a single-host single-pathogen framework, but many
pathogens infect multiple host species, and hosts are
infected by multiple pathogen species. This position
aims to develop new theoretical and statistical models
to examine multi-host multi-pathogen disease dynamics
in plants, and validate them using large databases on
the plant pests and pathogens of wild and agricultural
species.
The successful candidate will be expected to work with
a disperse team of collaborators, participate in working
groups, assist in supervision of graduate students, and
contribute to the lively research community at UBC.
Requirements
Key requirements include a strong conceptual and quan-
titative background in phylogenetic methods and/or
spatial ecology, prociency in programming (preferably
in R), and an excellent understanding of community ecol-
ogy and/or disease biology. Candidates with a proven
track record in analyzing large datasets and statistical
modelling will be given preference.
*The changing intensity of plant pests and pathogens
with climate warming*
Applications are invited for a fully funded one-year post-
doctoral position, starting September 2019 with possi-
bility of extension, on modelling the changing intensity
of plant pests and pathogens with climate warming us-
ing data from herbaria and new, eld-based sequencing
platforms.
Project Description
Species are responding to a warming climate in multiple
ways. Animals are migrating or reproducing sooner.
Plants are shifting their phenology, leang out and ow-
ering earlier in the growing season, or moving their
geographic distributions pole-wards or upwards in eleva-
tion. There has been increasing concern that such shifts
might result in spatial or phenological asynchronies be-
tween tightly coupled species, for example, owers and
their insect pollinators. To date, asynchrony in antago-
nistic interactions, such as between hosts and pathogens,
has received less attention; nonetheless, climate change
is predicted to facilitate the emergence of pests and
pathogens in new regions. This postdoctoral position
will use the vast historical record housed in herbarium
collections to document shifting pest and disease pres-
sures through time, and track contemporary pathogen
spread using new eld-based sequencing tools, such as
the Nanopore Minion sequencer, that can generate data
in near real time.June 1, 2019 EvolDir 103
The successful candidate will be expected to assist in the
development of statistical and molecular methods, help
in the supervision of graduate students, and contribute
to the lively research community at UBC.
Requirements
Key requirements include an excellent understanding
of community ecology and/or disease biology, a strong
conceptual and quantitative background, prociency in
programming (preferably in R). Candidates with ex-
perience in analyzing next generation sequence data,
and/or working with herbarium specimens will be given
preference.
Location
The position will be in the Davies lab (https://-
phyloecology.wordpress.com/) within the Biodiversity
Research Centre at the University of British Columbia
(https://biodiversity.ubc.ca/), with strong ties to the
Departments of Botany, and Forest and Conservation

name and emails of two references to Jonathan Davies,
UBC (j.davies@ubc.ca). Informal enquires welcome. Re-
view of applications *will begin 15 May* and continue

AncientPlantGenomics
Postdoctoral position in ancient plant genomics in ERC-
funded project TIMBER
The SAXO Institute, Faculty of Humanities, Univer-
sity of Copenhagen (UCPH), Denmark, in collaboration
with GeoGenetics, invites applications for a 1-year post-
doctoral position in ancient plant genomics to be lled
by 1st September 2019 or as soon as possible thereafter.
The position is for 12 months.
The project The project 'TIMBER' Northern Europe's
timber resource - chronology, origin and exploitation, led
by Aoife Daly, has received funding from the European
Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's
Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant
agreement No. 677152). In this project, timber in
Northern Europe is being studied, to attain a precise
chronology for trade of timber over a long time period
(c. 1100 to 1700). Using material and textual evidence
to identify the source of timber (provenance) the aim is
to map the trade in this construction material and to
show the regional and temporal uctuations in timber
exploitation and availability. Using a multi-disciplinary
approach (archaeological analysis, archival research and
a range of archaeological sciences) on a variety of specic
case studies, the team is working together to analyse
the sources and destinations of traded timber through
time.
Job content The postdoc will perform analyses on ar-
chaeological oak timber using ancient DNA (aDNA)
techniques with a view to identifying the timber's re-
gion of origin. The genomic research should complement
the dendrochronological provenance analysis to locate
historical sources of wood and better understand trade
routes within the Baltic region. The main focus will
be to develop an aDNA approach to study historical
wood samples, using it to identify the origin of the wood.
Specic archaeological case studies are the focus of the
project, and these have been preserved in a variety of
conditions, both in their in situ environments and after
excavation.
Qualication requirements In order to be considered for
the position, applicants must have research qualica-
tions at least corresponding to what can be achieved aspart of a successfully completed PhD within a relevant
eld.
Candidates that have experience in working with aDNA
and/or population genomics are highly encouraged to
apply. The project will consist of both laboratory work
and bioinformatics, but support is available for each,
through collaboration with the GeoGenetics Centre (also
within the University of Copenhagen). The Centre has
specialized DNA-free laboratories dedicated to perform-
ing aDNA work, and is consequently a world leader in
the discipline.
The postdoc will work closely with the other postdoc
appointees in the team and with the PI at the SAXO
Institute; so that the information gathered in the en-
tire project disciplines will be incorporated into a wider
analysis referring to the main project research questions.
The appointee will be part of a cross-disciplinary team
with emphasis on researching evidence for the trade of
timber in the past.

Postdoc in ecology and evolution
A 2 years postdoctoral fellowship in ecology and evolu-
tion is available at the Center for Macroecology, Evolu-
tion and Climate, Department of Biology, University of
Copenhagen.
Overall description of the project: Climate change poses
a major threat to biodiversity, potentially outpacing
the ability of species to adapt.Yet the scientic com-
munity still struggles to anticipate the responses of
biodiversity to climate change.Integrating pioneering
data and methods across macroecology, evolutionary
genomics and paleoclimatology we propose to elucidate
the demographic history of bird species during the last
million years of climate change.These species inhabit
dierent biomes (from the tropics to the poles) and rep-
resent a variety of life strategies and ecological traits.We
will reconstruct the demographic history under past
climate change of a variety of populations across 320
bird species using PSMC methods, and identify the role
of life strategies and species to explain dierent demo-
graphic responses across species.We will also provide
relevant baselines for avian population dynamics under106 EvolDir June 1, 2019
climate change.Revealing past demography will largely
improve our ability to anticipate potential responses or
species to ongoing climate warming.

hagen and both Zhang and Nogues-Bravo will be the
co-supervisors.
The position is open from September 2019 and is time
limited for two years with the possibility of extension
for another two years.
Tasks to carry out: Coordination of sample collections
and sequencing, population genomic analysis for infe-
rior paleo-demography, alignment of temporal trends in
demography and paleoclimatic conditions, estimates of
dierent responses to climate change and model how
species trace modulate those responses across space,
time and phylogeny.
Qualications: We are looking for highly motivated in-
dividuals with a PhD from ecology and evolutionary,
population genomics, macroevolution, phylogenetics /
phylogenomics, or similar elds.Candidates with below
experiences will be highly preferred.
Skills / expertise: Computational modeling, population
genomics analysis, phylogenomic / macroevolutionary
methods (ie, how ecological traits control demographic
responses to climate change after controlling by evo-
lutionary patterns represented in phylogenies), large
data sets management and data curation, strong coding
abilities, project coordination, curatorial or collection
of research-based expertise in birds.
Software / programming languages: R.

Research Fellow to participate in a high prole ERC
funded project entitled 'Understanding and exploiting
the P450 insect resistome' and then subsequently a BB-
SRC project entitled 'The adaptive potential of clonality
in aphid crop pests'. This post is available for four years
from July 2019. The post-holder will be based in the
Bass lab and be part of a thriving group comprising
several PhD students, post-doctoral research fellows and
technicians.
Both projects focus on dierent aspects of the evolu-tion of insect resistance to natural and synthetic toxins.
We will use a range of genomic, transcriptomic and
epigenetic approaches to understand the (epi)genetic
mechanisms that allow clonally reproducing insects to
adapt to sudden environmental change (such as that
imposed by pesticides) in the absence of sexual repro-
duction.
The successful applicant will employ a range of bioinfor-
matic and molecular approaches to investigate this topic.
Their primary role will be to generate and analyse next
generation sequence data, including resequenced insect
genomes, transcriptomes and whole genome bisulte
sequencing (WGBS) data. The fellow may also conduct,
or contribute to, follow-on work to functionally validate
the role of candidate resistance genes.
Over the duration of the project, the postdoc will be en-
couraged to develop their own avenues of research with
a view to establishing themselves as an independent
investigator. The project includes substantial funds
for sequencing, research consumables, and to facili-
tate attendance at national and international confer-
ences/workshops.
About you
Applicants will possess a relevant PhD or equivalent
qualication/experience in a related eld of study. Ex-
perience working with genomic data and bioinformatics
skills are essential. Experience with standard molecu-
lar biology methods and post-genomic functional ap-
proaches would be advantageous.

Postdoc with Roger Butlin and Kerstin Johannesson,
working on genomics of speciation in Littorina.
At the Marine Science department there is a long tradi-
tion in working with marine snails of the genus Littorina
as models for studies of local adaptation, hybrid zones
and speciation. This study focuses on ecotype forma-
tion and the subsequent evolution of barriers to gene
exchange in L. saxatilis. This species forms multiple
ecotypes but we concentrate on contrasting adaptations
to crab predation and wave action that occur in many
parts of its North Atlantic distribution, particularly
comparing Spanish and Swedish contact zones. We have
extensive phenotypic and genomic data sets (targeted
capture sequencing, whole genome re-sequencing and
SNPs). This postdoc project will contribute to bioinfor-
matic processing of data and analyses aimed at detecting
selection and its phenotypic correlates, including con-
tributions to reproductive isolation. One focus will be
on the phenotypic eects of inversions and the factors
inuencing clinal variation in both inversion frequen-
cies and phenotypes. An L. saxatilis reference genome
and a genetic map is available. This postdoc may also
contribute to eorts to improve these resources.

Post-doc: Expression plasticity in Daphnia
The Dudycha lab at the University of South Carolina is
recruiting a post-doctoral research associate to join an
NSF-funded project addressing the mutational origins
of phenotypic plasticity. As a whole, the project aims to
use Daphnia as a model system to understand how ex-
pression plasticity and phenotypic plasticity evolve. The
post-doc will use next-gen sequencing to test hypotheses
about how spontaneous mutation alters transcriptomes
and their responses to environmental variation, poten-
tially developing approaches to evaluate allele-specicity
and connections to organismal phenotypes.
Qualications: The selected candidate must have a
Ph.D. in a relevant eld completed prior to beginning
the position, including experience in the statistical de-
sign and analysis of biological data. The ideal candidate
would have experience analyzing RNAseq datasets, and
some experience quantifying phenotypes with live organ-
isms (not necessarily Daphnia). In addition, candidates
should be comfortable working in a diverse collaborative
environment, have excellent quantitative skills, strong
written and verbal communication skills, along with an
intellectual interest in the project.
The Dudycha lab has broad evolutionary interests: cur-

BioinformaticsWithBashAndPython
Oct14-18
Course: Bioinformatics with Bash and Python
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany)
When: 14-18 October 2019
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
biologists)
Overview:
A fundamental part of bioinformatics (in contrast to
simply computational biology) is the idea of scaling
and automation. We want to arrange our tools into
pipelines which can be executed with minimal supervi-
sion. Reliable automation of this type is key to many of
the things that we want from our analyses; chiey the
ability to reproduce our results, and to extend them to
other datasets.
In this course we will examine two dierent systems
for automating bioinformatic analyses. For situations
where we are mostly running existing command line
tools, bash scripting will allow us to build pipelines with
minimal overhead. We'll start with simple command
lines and see how the Linux environment - though not
designed with biology in mind - is well suited to the
type of automation we need.
For situations where we don't have an existing tool avail-
able, and hence need to implement our own logic, bash
quickly becomes unwieldy - it's theoretically possible to
write complex programs in bash, but the experience is
painful! It's much better to use a more modern program-
ming language, and for most biological tasks Python
ts the bill.

Berlin LandscapeGenomics
Nov25-29
Dear all,
we will run the 3rd edition of our LANDSCAPE GE-
NOMICS course in Berlin, from the 25th to the 29th of
November 2019, at the Freie Universit at (FU) Berlin.
INSTRUCTORS :
1) Dr. St ephane Joost (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
2) Oliver Selmoni, MSc (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Course overview
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, we will dis-
cuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic data and
subsequently show how to study genetic variation and
population structure across space in the R environment.
We will give an overview of the dierent statistical ap-
proaches to study local adaptation, and the participants
will be trained in using two of them, Sambada and
LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task of
the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-118 EvolDir June 1, 2019
nally, the course will consider the crucial aspects and
good habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This course is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneti-
cists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evo-
lutionary biology and conservation. Even though the
course is not intended for a specialized audience, basic
knowledge in evolutionary biology and population ge-
netics would help. Students will learn how to use GIS,
but basic computer skills are desirable (e.g. in the R
environment). A basic understanding of statistics is also
necessary.
Teaching Format
The course is organized in ten learning sessions. During
the rst two sessions, the course will provide a contex-
tualization of the research eld. Then, students will be
guided through a landscape genomics experiment with
sessions that couple brief theoretical introductions with
practical work.

Dear all,
We have the last 5 places left on our aDNA Paleoge-
nomics course!
When: 17th -21st of June 2019.
Where: Free University of Berlin (Germany).
Application deadline is: May 18th, 2019.
Instructors:
Dr. Claudio Ottoni (Sapienza University of Rome
(Italy))
Dr. Amine Namouchi (University of Oslo (Norway))
Overview
This course will introduce biologists to the main bioin-
formatic tools for the analysis of Next Generation Se-
quencing (NGS) data from ancient samples. Through
a series of theoretical and practical hands-on sessions,
the main goal of this course is to provide a clear under-
standing of the most common bioinformatic methods
adopted in a wide range of paleogenomics projects (from
metagenomic screening of ancient samples, to NGS reads
mapping and phylogenetic tree reconstruction). Par-
ticular attention will be given to quality control, DNA
damage assessment and variants calling. A basic intro-
duction to NGS platforms and the main le formats
used in most common bioinformatics pipelines will be
provided. Each day will consist of a mix of introductory
lectures on the theoretical background of the programs
that will be used, followed by hands-on exercises using
command line tools performed by the participants under
guided supervision.
Target Audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
The course is aimed primarily at researchers (MSc and
PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, engineers) inter-
ested in learning the dierent steps from NGS raw data
analysis to phylogenetic tree reconstruction in archaeo-
logical samples. The hands-on sessions are targeted to
beginners and more advanced users alike. The practical
sessions will cover the most common pipelines adopted
in paleogenomics, and can be applied to a wide range
of projects, from metagenomics to genome resequenc-
ing. Attendees should have a background in biology and
some familiarity with genomic data.June 1, 2019 EvolDir 119
STRUCTURE
The course material will be delivered over 5 days, in
10 half-day sessions. These lessons will build o of
one another, and feature a mix of lecture and in-class
exercises.

Berlin Selection Oct28-Nov1
Course: GENOME-WIDE SIGNATURES OF SELEC-
TION AND ASSOCIATION STUDIES
Where: Free University of Berlin
When: 28 October -1 November 2019
General Topic: Genome-wide analysis of selection sig-
natures and genotype-phenotype associations
INSTRUCTORS:
Dr. Pablo Orozco-terWengel (Cardi University, Wales
(UK))

Dr. Filippo Biscarini (CNR, ITA)
( https://www.researchgate.net/prole/-
Filippo Biscarini )
Overview
This course will introduce students, researchers and pro-
fessionals into the eld of using genomics data to identify
meaningful genomic regions. The course comprises two
approaches: one based only on genomic information,
which will use populations genetics techniques to detect
signatures of selection (both natural and articial); the
other approach will combine genomic and phenotypic
data to identify genetic associations for specic pheno-
types (i.e. GWAS, genome-wide association studies).Format
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning how to make
use of genomic information to study how selection has
shaped the genome and how the genome inuences mea-
surable phenotypes. It will include information useful
for both beginners and more advanced users. We will
start by introducing general concepts of population ge-
netics, which will take up most of the rst half of the
course; the second half of the course will be centered
mainly on GWAS and related aspects.
Attendees should have a background in biology, specif-
ically genetics. There will be a mix of lectures and
hands-on practical exercises using R and the Linux
command line, and bespoke software. Some basic under-
standing of R programming and the Linux environment
will be advantageous. Attendees should have also some
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments, including genotyping-by-sequencing
(GBS), and commercial genotyping platforms.

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the course 'PYTHON
MACHINE LEARNING IN BIOLOGY'.
Instructor: Nichole Bennett (The University of Texas at
Austin, USA) Dates: October 7th-11th, 2019 Location:
Crete, Greece
COURSE OVERVIEW:
The eld of biological sciences is becoming increasingly
information-intensive and data-rich. For example, the
growing availability of DNA sequence data or clinical
measurements from humans promises a better under-
standing of the important questions in biology. However,
the complexity and high-dimensionality of these biologi-
cal data make it dicult to pull out mechanisms from
the data. Machine Learning techniques promise to be
useful tools for resolving such questions in biology be-cause they provide a mathematical framework to analyze
complex and vast biological data. In turn, the unique
computational and mathematical challenges posed by
biological data may ultimately advance the eld of ma-
chine learning as well. This course will cover basics
of the Python programming language as well as the
pandas and sklearn Python libraries for data wrangling
and machine learning. The course is intended to give
participants a conceptual overview of machine learn-
ing algorithms and an intuition for the mathematics
underlying them, equipping participants to be able to
choose and implement appropriate models for biological
datasets.
PROGRAM:
Monday, October 7th, 2019. Python Foundations Morn-
ing: Python Basics, Handling Data in Pandas, Basic
Pandas Data Cleaning Afternoon: Exploratory Data
Analysis in Pandas, Data Visualization in Python.
Tuesday, October 8th, 2019. Supervised Machine Learn-
ing: Classication Morning: KNN, Introduction to
sklearn workow. Afternoon: Train/Test Split, and
Bias-Variance Tradeo, Model Evaluation.
Wednesday, October 9th, 2019. Supervised Machine

Cyprus MetageneticsBiodiversity
Oct2-8
*Workshop: Analysis of metagenetic data for macroe-
cology*
Where: University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus
When: 2nd-8th October 2019
Fees: FREE for all participants
Apply now! Application deadline extension: 7th of June
www.metagenecol.eu Workshop overview:
New sequencing methods are rapidly changing the analy-
sis of biodiversity. Metagenetics of community, ingested
or environmental samples generates high-resolution data
on composition, diversity and evolutionary history in a
fraction of the time of traditional methods. However,
using the great ood of DNA data for macroecology
requires new bioinformatics and statistical skills. This
course will teach procedures for the bioinformatic pro-
cessing of major types of genetic data for species compo-
sition and phylogeny. Statistical analysis of the resulting
biodiversity data will then be explored for community
analysis and patterns of diversity distribution. The
course is unique in that it takes students from the basics
of bioinformatics and data handling to advanced topics
in the use of large-scale DNA data in evolutionary and
ecological analysis. The course will comprise 5 days of
guided practicals using real-world data, supplemented
by short talks and thematic lectures. There will be open
time for discussions around issues in metagenetics, with
the particular aim of discussing participant queries and
ideas.
Instructors:
The instructors are prominent evolutionary biologists
and ecologists, who have developed many of the pro-
tocols and methodologies used in the analysis of meta-
genetic data for macroecology: Prof. Alfried P. Vogler
(Imperial College London and the Natural History Mu-
seum,UK), Dr. Carola G omez-Rodr guez (University
of Santiago de Compostela, Spain) and Dr. Thomas
J. Creedy (Natural History Museum, UK). The local
workshop organizers are Dr. Anna Papadopoulou and
Dr. Vasilis Promponas (University of Cyprus).
Workshop details:
There will be no fees for participants as the work-shop is organized within the framework of the iBio-
Gen project under the Horizon 2020 Twinning funding
scheme (www.ibiogen.eu). Free coee breaks and lunch
during weekdays, as well as a free excursion on the
weekend, will be oered to all participants. However,
travel and accommodation costs should be covered by
the participants themselves.
The course is aimed at graduate students and early-
career researchers interested in applying novel DNA-
based methods to macroecological questions. The course
focuses on bioinformatic and analytical methods, and
participants are expected to have a working knowledge
of R for linear parametric statistics and basic commu-
nity data analysis. Some prior experience with the linux
command line is also preferred, although pre-course on-
line study materials will be available to all attendees
to ensure a common starting point. An understand-
ing of phylogenetics would be useful to get the most
of out of some sessions. For applications, please send
a Curriculum Vitae and a short motivation letter to
ibiogen.project@gmail.com by the 7th of June 2019.

Analysing Environmental Adaptation Using Landscape
Genomics in R (EDAP01)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/adaptive-
landscape-genomics-in-r-edap01/ This course will be
delivered by Matt Fitzpatrack and Dr Aki Laruson
form the 15th - 19th July in Glasgow City Centre.
Course Overview:
Local adaptation to climate and other environmental
drivers increasingly is being studied at the molecular
level using high-throughput sequencing methods, with
applications spanning both model and non-model or-
ganisms. At the same time, statistical tools for mod-
eling and mapping patterns of biodiversity have seen
increasing application, including to the challenge of un-
derstanding the drivers of spatial variation in adaptive
genomic variation and mapping these patterns under
current and future climate. This 5-day course will pro-
vide the skill set necessary to analyze sequence data
for signatures of natural selection and to apply spatialmodeling techniques to these patterns to quantify and
map population-level genetic variation using two spa-
tial modelling algorithms V Generalized Dissimilarity
Modelling (GDM) and Gradient Forest (GF).
The course will include introductory lectures, instruc-
tion on using the Linux command line for manipulation
of genomic data, guided computer coding in R, and
exercises for the participants, with an emphasis on visu-
alization and reproducible workows. Portions of each
day will be allotted for students to work through their
own datasets with the instructors.

Dears, we are pleased to announce the summer course:
\Bridging Phylogeny and Population genetics: Inferring
divergence and selection at both interspecies and in-
traspecies level"
When: 27 August-1 September 2019.
Where:The Campus at Fondazione Edmund Mach in
San Michele all'Adige (Trento, Italy between moun-
tains and vineyards, http://www.fmach.it/eng), and
the (world oldest) Botanical Garden of University of
Padua ( http://www.ortobotanicopd.it/en).
What: Phylogeny studies inter-specic variations and
typically describes the macroveolutionary changes of
organisms over long time scales; population genetics
instead typically focuses on the intra-species variability
and describes microevolutionary changes occurred dur-
ing the relatively recent history of a population. The
two disciplines are characterised by dierent tools and
methods, and too often phylogeneticists do not under-
stand what population geneticists do, and vice versa.
With this course we aim at stimulating a dialogue and
a constructive discussion between students and teach-
ers with phylogenetics, population genetics, but also
ecological backgrounds, in such a way that we can ap-
preciate the complementary nature of these disciplines.
All students should be united by the will to understand
better each other's methodological processes. The aim
is to form students that are capable of understanding
both approaches and lling the gap between the two
disciplines. We will do this by providing the theoretical
and practical bases of both phylogenetics and popula-
tion genetics. The course will cover some important
applications such as genome scaled detection of positive
selection using PAML, site frequency spectrum analysis
using Sweepnder, inference of divergence time using
BEAST, inference of population past demography us-
ing Fastsimcoal. Every day we will alternate topics on
PHYLOgenetics, POPulation genetics, and a MIXture
of them.
Teachers: Lino Ometto (evolutionary zoologist, Univer-
sity of Pavia) Emiliano Trucchi (population geneticist,
Marche Polytechnic University and University of Oslo)
Omar Rota-Stabelli (molecular phylogeneticist, Fon-
dazione Edmund Mach) Francesca Cagnacci (MovementEcologist, Fondazione Edmund Mach) Daniele Silvestro
(molecular phylogeneticist, University of Gothenburg)
Erlend Nilsen (population ecologist, NINA- Norway)
Participation: This course is aimed at PhD students,
but participation of post-docs, researchers, managers
and motivated MSc is also encouraged. There will be
room for a maximum of 25 participants, with priority
given to students from the IRSAE network and the SIBE
society.
Fees and costs: The course is supported by the Inter-
national Research School in Applied Ecology (IRSAE
www.irsae.no), and co-organized by Fondazione Edmund
Mach, NINA, and the Italian Society for Evolutionary
Biology. Fees and costs vary according to aliations.
IRSAE participants: Fees, board and lodging are cov-
ered by the IRSAE network; they may also obtain re-
imbursement for travel costs through IRSAE and their
institution. SIBE members pay no fees. Otherwise,
students: 130 e; Researchers/Seniors: 250 e. In all cases
food (lunch+dinner) plus lodging in the campus can be
booked at 80 e/day. Alternative lodging possibilities
are available in the area.
5 ECTS credits will be assigned, after positive grades
in a nal exam.
Format: This 5 days course consists of a meet and greet
evening + three full days with technical seminars and
practical labs + one day of excursion to nearby hut
with symposium and lectures + a trip to Padua (2h
bus drive, organised by the school) with nal lectures.
For those interested is possible to extend the staying
in Padova to attend the congress of the Italian Society
for Evolutionary Biology https://sibe2019.sibe-iseb.it/;

/scate.phenoscape.org/2019-workshop-cfp.html
* Free Registration: https://goo.gl/forms/-
802KN6cd6cQOI01Q2 COURSE OVERVIEW:
Ontologies encode information about a domain of
knowledge, such as how anatomical structures are
related, which is crucial information for modeling char-
acter evolution. Phenoscape, in its current Semantic
Comparative Analyses for Trait Evolution (SCATE;
http://scate.phenoscape.org) project, is developing
tools that use the computable knowledge in ontologies
to improve phenotypic character modeling and inform
analyses of trait evolution. To train evolutionary
biologists and developers of comparative analysis tools
to adopt these new capabilities, the SCATE team
will be holding a short course on using ontologies in
comparative analyses of integrated anatomical traits, in
conjunction with iEvoBio and the Evolution Meetings,
on June 26, 2019 in Providence, Rhode Island.130 EvolDir June 1, 2019
Attendees will learn how to use R packages such as
RPhenoscape (http://rphenoscape.phenoscape.org) to
access a knowledgebase of ontology-linked phenotypes
(kb.phenoscape.org), build character matrices that take
anatomical dependencies into account, and use these
to construct stochastic character maps on a phylogeny.
The course will also include a practical introduction to
community ontologies for biodiversity domain knowledge
(anatomy, taxonomy, phenotypic attribute).
Graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and software de-
velopers with interests in comparative analyses, mor-
phology, and phylogenetics are encouraged to apply.
Free registration: Applications accepted until May 15th

Asked Questions for 2019 at https://hackmd.io/s/-
BkjZDqNNV **No prior programming experience is
required**, although bravery in the face of the unknown
is necessary! A year or more of graduate school in
a biological science is strongly suggested. Faculty,
postdocs, and research sta are more than welcome, as
are researchers from industry.
The 2019 schedule is up! http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/-
SCHEDULE.html We plan to run multiple independent
classrooms of 20-30 participants each. Each classroom
will have 2 lead instructors and 3-4 TAs and helpers. In
2019, we will provide both introductory and intermedi-
ate tracks to accomodate all levels of learners.
We strive to provide a welcoming and inclusive environ-
ment, and work hard to accommodate learner needs.
This course supports and encourages diversity by creat-
ing an environment in which people can communicate
eectively and share their unique talents. This diver-
sity of talents enriches the course by fuelling creativity,
innovation, and success!
## What will I learn if I attend?
Our goal for these two weeks is to get students to the
point where they are ready to begin analyzing their own
data on a computer cluster, and are more comfortable
with help forums and other online resources to be able
to continue advancing their own skills.
Students will gain practical experience in:
- bash shell and R scripting - Cloud comput-
ing/Jetstream - Installing and running many bioinfor-
matics tools (e.g.BLAST, bwa, samtools) - Querying
mappings and evaluating assemblies - Running work-
ows in the cloud and evaluating their results - Estimat-
ing computational resources

AncientDNAHumanHistory Aug5-9
Course Description: Ancient DNA has revolutionized
the eld of archaeology over the past few years by provid-
ing unprecedented insights into past population move-
ments, admixture events with other hominins - like Ne-
anderthals - and adaptation to particular environments.
This revolution is tightly linked with the introduction
of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and
the rise of 'big data'. This intensive one-week course
will provide students with a broad introduction to the
varied uses of ancient DNA in archaeology and hands-on
experience working with high-throughput sequencing
datasets. The course is composed of a series of lectures,
covering a wide range of topics and hands-on computing
practicals, and is primarily aimed at students in biology,
archaeology, linguistics, and related elds who would
like to learn more about ancient DNA applications in
the post-genome era.
Where: University of Copenhagen
When: August 5th-9th, 2019
ECTS credits: 5.0
Formal requirements: Applicants should have a rst
degree in archaeology, biology, linguistics or a related
eld.Teaching and learning methods: Lectures, computing
practicals, and seminars based around paper discussions.

SLiMEvolutionaryModeling Sep9-13
Hi all.
First of all, as background: SLiM is a software package
for creating evolutionary models/simulations that are
individual-based and genetically explicit. It is script-
able, exible, fast, and includes an interactive graphical
modeling environment. You can read more about it on
its home page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
September 9-13, 2019, a ve-day workshop will be of-
fered at UEA, the University of East Anglia (Norwich,
UK). It will be hosted by Simone Immler, of UEA. It
will be free, and open to participants outside of the
university. HOWEVER, registration is required, a lim-
ited number of seats are available, and priority will
be given to registrants aliated with UEA. To apply,
please send an email to both of us (S.Immler@uea.ac.uk,
bhaller@mac.com) with the info below. The deadline
for applying is the end of the day on 1 August.
For this workshop, your application email should include:
(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any other
forward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM that
you hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted. Note that acceptance will likely
be rst-come-rst-served (apart from the priority for
those from the hosting institution), so early application
is advised.
The plan is to try to cover all the major topics in the
SLiM manual, starting with lots of introductory materialJune 1, 2019 EvolDir 133
to get beginners up to speed with SLiM and its asso-
ciated scripting language Eidos, and hopefully ending
up at advanced topics like non-Wright-Fisher models,
tree-sequence recording, continuous-space models, and
nucleotide-based models. We won't cover everything in
the manual - that would be overwhelming! - but we'll
try to cover all the big topics. There will also be time
for attendees to work on their own models with help
from me, and we may also have time to explore some
optional side topics that are of particular interest to
those attending each workshop. The workshops will be
taught principally using SLiMgui on macOS. For this
workshop, ATTENDEES MUST BRING THEIR OWN
MAC LAPTOP. (A Mac is required to run SLiMgui,
which is necessary for teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).

Course Overview: This course will provide a theoret-
ical, analytical and practical introduction to QIIME
2 (canonically pronounced ¥chime two), which stands
for Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology 2, and
Qiita (canonically pronounced ¥cheetah), a multiomics
and multi-study online tool. QIIME 2 and Qiita are
open source software packages for comparison and anal-
ysis of microbial communities, primarily based on high-
throughput amplicon sequencing data (such as SSU
rRNA) generated on a variety of platforms, but also sup-
porting analysis of other types of data (such as shotgun
metagenomic, metabolomics or proteomics). The main
Qiita deployment ( http://qiita.microbio.me/) allows
users to manage and analyze large studies, their meta-
data and the multiple data types generated from thesame samples. Additionally, it allows users to combine
their samples with other published and public studies
available in the system. QIIME 2 is a stand-alone envi-
ronment for the analysis of individual microbiome data
sets that can be used on your laptop, university compu-
tational resources, and cloud computing resources.
Course objectives: By the end of the course, participants
will be able to: 1) Understand the most recent QIIME2
and Qiita features for microbial community analysis 2)
Select the best workow and parameters to perform
the dierent steps for microbial community analysis 3)
Understand and apply on their own datasets dierent
phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic metrics to compare
microbial diversity samples 4) Upload and analyze their
own datasets using Qiita and compare their studies with
other public studies

SLiMEvolutionaryModeling
Aug12-16
Hi all.
First of all, as background: SLiM is a software package
for creating evolutionary models/simulations that are
individual-based and genetically explicit. It is script-
able, exible, fast, and includes an interactive graphical
modeling environment. You can read more about it on
its home page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
August 12-16, 2019, a ve-day SLiM workshop will be
oered at Umea University (Umea, Sweden). It will be
hosted by Ake Brannstrom and Xiao-Ru Wang, both of
Umea University. It will be free, and open to partici-
pants outside of the university. HOWEVER, registra-
tion is required, a limited number of seats are available,
and priority will be given to registrants aliated with
Umea. To apply, please send an email to all three
of us (ake.brannstrom@umu.se, xiao-ru.wang@umu.se,
bhaller@mac.com) with the info below. The deadline
for applying is the end of the day on 1 July.
For this workshop, your application email should include:
(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any other
forward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM that
you hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted. Note that acceptance will likely
be rst-come-rst-served (apart from the priority for
those from the hosting institution), so early application
is advised.
The plan is to try to cover all the major topics in the
SLiM manual, starting with lots of introductory material
to get beginners up to speed with SLiM and its asso-
ciated scripting language Eidos, and hopefully ending
up at advanced topics like non-Wright-Fisher models,
tree-sequence recording, continuous-space models, and
nucleotide-based models. We won't cover everything inthe manual - that would be overwhelming! - but we'll
try to cover all the big topics. There will also be time
for attendees to work on their own models with help
from me, and we may also have time to explore some
optional side topics that are of particular interest to
those attending each workshop. The workshops will be
taught principally using SLiMgui on macOS. For this
workshop, we will have a classroom arranged with Macs
at each seat. (A Mac is required to run SLiMgui, which
is necessary for teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).
Cheers,

Jun5-7
*Fantastic Forces* is a workshop for postgraduates to
get introduced to the cutting edge of evolutionary ge-
netics research. By bringing together researchers from
across the spectrum of evolutionary biology research,
this workshop aims at promoting an environment for
reection and discussion about how dierent tools can
be used cooperatively to answer complex questions.
Our workshop will comprise three themed days, each
consisting of a series of talks in the morning followed
by tutorials in the afternoon. Fantastic Forces will be
held on *June 5 ^th - 7 ^th 2019 at the University of St
Andrews*, Arts Building.
With a terric list of expert speakers, Fantastic Forces
is an excellent opportunity for students to meet with
experts in the eld, learn valuable data analysis skills,
and discuss research ideas and career prospects.https:/-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.June 1, 2019 EvolDir 137
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
