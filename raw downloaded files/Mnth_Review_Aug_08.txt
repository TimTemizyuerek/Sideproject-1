Leiden IslandEvolution Feb12-13
150 Years after Darwin’s On the Origin of Species, is-
land evolution is entering a new phase. By habitat frag-
mentation, we humans create more and more islands,
while at the same time, by transporting species from
their native biomes, we remove the dispersal barriers
that kept habitats isolated.
To explore the implications of this new era of island evo-
lution, the National Museum of Natural History in Lei-
den, the Netherlands, together with the Darwin Cen-
ter for Biogeology in Utrecht, the Netherlands, will co-
organise an international congress on
“Island Evolution 150 Years After Darwin”
12 & 13 February 2009
Museum Naturalis
Leiden, the Netherlands
The meeting will bring together traditional students
of island biotas, experimental/theoretical community
ecologists, and evolutionary biologists, to explore the
role of island-biological processes in a world in which
the “island processes” of isolation and dispersal are be-
ing drastically altered.
Conﬁrmed keynote speakers:
Mark Lomolino (State University of New York, Syra-
cuse)
Peter Morin (Rutgers University, New Jersey)

istration procedure will soon be available at:

Beyond Cladistics: A Festschrift for Prof C J
Humphries
As an approach to the discovery of phylogenetic rela-
tionships among organisms, cladistics took the system-
atics community by storm. According to David Hull, in
his 1988 account of its history, cladistics was winning
out everywhere; according to Colin Patterson, cladis-
tics3began in the late 1960s, accelerated in the 1970s,
and was virtually complete by the eighties2; in con-
trast, Gareth Nelson suggested that cladistics is suf-
fering from3Arrested Development2. This symposium,
entitled Beyond Cladistics, in honour of botanist Chris
Humphries, will address some general issues relating to
cladistics: its past, its present and its future if, indeed,
there is anything beyond cladistics itself.

Melbourne DarwinAnniversary
Feb12
Come Share in a Unique Experience
You are invited to come to Melbourne, Australia to
share in a unique conference experience, celebrating
the 200th anniversary of Darwinˆ as birth (February 12,
1809) and the 150th anniversary of the publication of
the Origin of the Species
When Charles Darwin came to Australia on the voy-
age of HMS Beagle in 1836 he was an obscure English
naturalist.
23 years later the publication of Darwinˆ as book, Ori-
gin of the Species, sparked an intellectual, social and
spiritual revolution.ˆ a It radically transformed our un-
derstanding of life on this planet ˆ a the origins of life, our
relationship to other species and the way life can adapt
or fail to do so in the face of environmental change.
Evolution ˆ a the Experience will explore the breadth
and depth of Darwinˆ as ongoing impact in basic biol-
ogy, agriculture, medicine, psychology, sociology, poli-
tics, history and religion.
Evolution ˆ a the Experience will be embedded in rich
menu of public events, each in their own way touch-
ing the Darwinian theme ˆ a theatre, ﬁlm, forums, de-
bates and exhibitions involving theatre companies, or-
chestras, cinemas, museums, art galleries, libraries,
botanic gardens, zoos, herbaria, schools, universi-
ties and the media. And on February 12, 2009
there will be a unique birthday celebration <http://-
www.evolution09.com.au/social.php >for Charles Dar-
win.

SYSTEMA NATURAE 250
26-27 August 2008, Paris, FranceAugust 1, 2008 EvolDir 7
A symposium celebrating 250 years of zoological
nomenclature, starting with the publication of the 10th
edition of Linnaeus1s Systema Naturae on January 1st
1758, has been organised by the secretariat of the In-
ternational Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.
Systema Naturae 250 runs concurrently with the
20th International Congress of Zoology in Paris,
26-29 August, 2008 ( http://icz2008.snv.jussieu.fr/-
program.htm ), and will have its plenary session on 26
August 2 pm 6 pm. This will include Prof E.O.
Wilson1s plenary lecture3The Linnaean Ark2, and
the presentation, by Professor Wilson, of the Sherborn
award for outstanding service to biodiversity informat-
ics to Professor Alessandro Minelli. The symposium
ﬂyer can be found here, with details of all speakers:
http://www.iczn.org/Systema Naturae 250A5amended (2).pdf
Themes covered by the meeting will include the evolu-
tion of zoological nomenclature over the past 250 years,
the future of animal taxonomy, web publication of tax-
onomic work, including changes to the Code, copyright
issues, and the Encyclopedia of Life. All papers by in-
vited speakers will be published in a commemorative
volume Systema Naturae 250 The Linnaean Ark. This
symposium represents a key opportunity to discuss all
of the above issues.
Because the symposium is part of the 20th ICZ, regis-
tration is necessary, and possible at:
http://www.alphavisa.com/icz2008/registration.php
The fee includes lunch for all four days of the meeting
as well as coﬀee breaks, the congress banquet on the
29th, participation in all scientiﬁc and poster sessions
and of course all abstract and programme booklets,
bags and other material. We look forward to seeing
you in Paris!

Philadelphia ASM May17-21
Dear EvolDir,
We are now planning symposia for the 109th American
Society for Microbiology General Meeting to be held in
Philadelphia, PA, May 17-21, 2009.2009 is the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin and the
150th anniversary of the publication of the Origin of
Species , and therefore should be an important year for
ASM Division R - Evolutionary & Genomic Microbiol-
ogy. I invite everyone to consider proposing a sympo-
sium. Any topic related to evolutionary and genomic
microbiology can be considered. Topics that have been
casually discussed include:
- The origin of bacterial species - Evolution of sex and
recombination - The ﬂexible genome in ecological adap-
tation - Microbial evolution in the human microbiome
Symposia are 2.5hrs in length with a maximum of ﬁve
speakers. Speakers are reimbursed for some of their
travel expenses (up to $900 for US-based speakers and
$1200 for non-US speakers). Symposia conveners do not
get any reimbursement unless they also present a talk.
Meeting registration fees will be reimbursed for speak-
ers who are not ASM members. Symposium propos-
als are ﬁrst vetted by divisional oﬃcers (Paul Turner,
Jennifer Wernegreen, and me for Division R), and for-
warded to the Divisional Group for ﬁnal review and
selection.
The application process is fairly painless. A web form
is available at: http://gm.asm.org/session-proposal/-
session-proposal.asp . All proposals must be completed
by Aug 18th.
I hope you will consider proposing a symposium, and
look forward to seeing you in Phily next May.

THE EVOLUTION OF SEX AND ASEXUAL RE-
PRODUCTION
Genetics Society Autumn Meeting, University of Bath,

Scientiﬁc organisers: Laurence Hurst (Bath) and Roger8 EvolDir August 1, 2008
Butlin (Sheﬃeld)
To accompany the presentation of 2008 Mendel Lec-
ture by Professor Matthew Meselson and the 2008 Bal-
four Lecture by Daven Presgraves, The Genetics Soci-
ety is organizing a one day conference on THE EVOLU-
TION OF SEX AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION.
This will be held at the University of Bath, UK on Fri-
day 5th September.
While the maintenance of sex and recombination re-
mains an intellectual challenge, the long term persis-
tence of some asexuals is equally puzzling. What if any-
thing can be learnt about the former issues by studying
the latter and vice versa? There are multiple contrast-
ing approaches to these problems: theoretical versus
empirical approaches, genetical verses ecological expla-
nations, ﬁeld versus laboratory systems. This meeting
will bring together all of these strands in current re-
search.

MEEGID IX University of California at Irvine, 30th
October-1st November 2008
PLEASE CIRCULATE
It is our pleasure to announce oﬃcially that the 9th In-
ternational Meeting “Molecular Epidemiology and Evo-
lutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases” (MEEGID
IX), will be held at UC Irvine, California.
MEEGID IX will be co-organized by the University
of California at Irvine ( http://www.uci.edu/ ) and the
Institut de Recherche pour le D´ eveloppement (IRD;
http://www.ird.fr/ ) in France. Principal organizers are
Francisco J. Ayala (Dept Ecology and Evolution, UC
Irvine) and Michel Tibayrenc (IRD).
Communications on genetics, genomics, proteomics,
phylogenetics, population biology, mathematical mod-
eling, and bioinformatics are welcome. They can report
on the host, the pathogen, or the vector for vector-
borne diseases. Papers considering host + pathogen
or pathogen + vector (co-evolution) are particularly
encouraged. All pathogens are within the scope of
MEEGID: viruses, parasitic protozoa, helminths, fun-
gal organisms, and prions. All infectious models can be
explored, including those of veterinary or agronomical
relevance.

The MEEGID meetings are organized in synergy with
the new journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution (El-
sevier; http://www.elsevier.com/locate/meegid ), cov-
ering the same scientiﬁc topic. Launched only 6 years
ago, Infection, Genetics and Evolution is now published
with six issues per year, and has been indexed by Med-
line and Index Medicus, starting from the ﬁrst issue. It
has been quoted 3.5/5.0 (“very good”) by the US Na-
tional Library of Medicine. It is now covered by ISI and
the oﬃcial impact factor for 2007 is 2.407 (ISI Web of
knowledge).
The papers communicated for MEEGID IX will be pub-
lished in a special issue of Infection, Genetics and Evo-
lution, as already done for MEEGID VI (Paris, July
2002) and MEEGID VIII (Bangkok, Thailand, Novem-
ber 2006). MEEGID IX will include 10-15 plenary lec-
tures, about 20 specialized symposia, 12-15 “express-
debates” (a 20-min presentation by a single speaker fol-
lowed by 40 min of free discussion) and several poster
sessions.
Special emphasis through plenary lectures and sym-
posia will be given to health problems of particular in-
terest to mediterranean and tropical countries: AIDS,
malaria, tuberculosis (especially multidrug resistant
TB), sleeping sickness, leishmanioses, Chagas disease,
ebola, bird ﬂu, Chikungunya, as well as cattle and crop
pathogens. Plenary lectures and symposia will also deal
with transversal topics such as population genetics or
species concepts. The congress is open to proposals for
conferences and symposia.
Awards will be attributed to the best oral communica-
tion, the best oral communication by a scientist from
the Southern World on a problem speciﬁcally relevant
to these areas, the best oral communication by a stu-
dent, and the best communication by poster. Each
prize winner will be oﬀered a free 2-year membershipto Infection, Genetics and Evolution.
The abstract submission deadline is the 30th September
2008.
Registration Fee: 200.00 euros or equivalent in other
currencies. Reduced fees upon request for scientists
from developing countries who do not have interna-
tional funds. Registration fees are waived for students.

UCrete Zoogeography Sep22-26
The Hellenic Zoological Society and the Natural His-
tory Museum of Crete (NHMC) University of Crete
will organize the /11 ^th International Congress on the
Zoogeography and Ecology of Greece and Adjacent Re-
gions/. The Congress will take place at the new per-
manent exhibition halls of the NHMC (Irakleio, Crete,
Greece) between the 22 ^nd and the 26 ^th of Septem-
ber, 2009.
The congress’ scope includes *all issues** *related to
the animal systematic, phylogeny, phylogeography, and
ecology in the eastern Mediterranean region. Research
concerning all aspects of animal biodiversity (terres-
trial, subterranean, freshwater and marine) within a
geographical region that includes the Balkan and Ital-
ian peninsulas, Asia Minor and Anatolia, as well as
the Near East and the Mediterranean coasts of north-
eastern Africa are welcome. The oﬃcial language of the
11th ICZEGAR will be English.
Experience gained from the 10 previous successful con-
gresses of this series during the last 33 years has shown
that the meeting can become an important forum for
contact and information exchange between scientists
working on a wide range of subjects at a region with
very high biodiversity. Participants will have the op-
portunity to discuss and collaborate on many basic and
applied research subjects, such as conservation biology,
biogeography, ﬁsheries, population ecology, phylogenet-
ics etc.
News will be regularly posted in the web address10 EvolDir August 1, 2008

PhD Studentship Conservation and monitoring of
legally protected and threatened bryophyte species in
Ireland. National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin and
Trinity College, Dublin. Ireland has one of the rich-
est bryoﬂoras in Europe, with over 50% of the Euro-
pean bryoﬂora represented. The target species for this
project are bryophyte species identiﬁed as being of cur-
rent conservation concern in Ireland. The list includes
proposed Red Data species and species listed in na-
tional legislation such as the FPO (Flora Protection
Order Statutory Instrument No. 94 of 1999). The aims
of this fully funded project are to contribute to the
conservation management of these species by assessing
clonal growth, reproduction and population diﬀerenti-
ation. This will require the development of appropriate
ﬁeld monitoring methods, site characterization, assess-
ment of population sizes, use of molecular markers to
provide population genetic information, and the devel-
opment of conservation management guidelines. The
research will be co-supervised by Dr Noeleen Smyth
(National Botanic Garden, Glasnevin) and Dr Daniel
Kelly (Botany Department, Trinity College Dublin).
Conditions of the award: Applicants should have a ﬁrst
or upper second class primary degree, or an MSc, in
an appropriate discipline (Botany, Environmental Sci-
ence). Familiarity with molecular techniques, ﬁeld sur-
vey work, an ability to work in detail with small spec-
imens and a full, clean driver’s licence are all highly
desirable, as well as a capacity for both individual re-
search and intergration into team work. The starting
date for the position is October 2008. Amount of the
award: Successful candidates will receive a stipend of
17,000 per year, with annual increment, for up to three
years. Fees for postgraduate students from the EU will
be fully covered by the project. There will be opportu-
nities to earn additional money through teaching and
demonstrating on undergraduate courses and invigilat-
ing examinations. Application procedure: submit acurrent CV, a letter containing a statement of inter-
est, and the names and contact details of two referees
to Dr N. Smyth (National Botanic Garden, Glasnevin,
Dublin 9, Ireland. Email:noeleen.smyth@opw.ie.

PhD thesis at INRA Poitou-Charentes France in the
research unit on meadow and forage crops (URP3F).
Subject: Selection versus phenotypic plasticity in the
evolution of heterogeneous populations: case study of
a perennial ryegrass sward. The thematic includes the
following questions: - What are the speciﬁc roles of
selection and phenotypic plasticity in evolution pro-
cesses? - How plasticity aﬀects the intensity of se-
lection? - Is there a variability of plasticity between
genotypes? - Could plasticity be subject to selection?
Using a F2 population of perennial ryegrass (Lolium
perenne L.) which maximizes the leaf length diversity,
QTLs of traits involved in the response to selection
pressure will be identiﬁed. Allelic frequencies for se-
lected markers (under QTLs) and neutral markers will
be followed. Concepts and models of population genet-
ics will be used to understand and predict the evolution
of the population. The experiment was started a year
ago. The PhD student will perform phenotypic obser-
vations and molecular work as well as data analyses
and modeling. The skills required include good knowl-
edge in evolutionary biology, population genetics and
quantitative genetics. Practices in morphological mea-
surements and in molecular biology are necessary. The
thesis should start in November or December 2008. Ap-
plications (CV, motivation letter and references) haveto be send by email at isabelle.litrico@lusignan.inra.fr

ˆ aPotential ecosystem eﬀects of future GM crop intro-
ductions through establishment of crop/wild hybrids or
feral populationsˆ a.
One aspect of Environmental Risk Assessments (ERA)
of transgenic crops involves the introduction of the
transgene in natural environments through outcross-
ing with a wild relative or through the establishment
of feral populations. In the current project the like-
lihood of an expansion of hybrid/feral plants as well
as the associated and potentially adverse eﬀects on the
ecosystem will be studied. The experimental systems
are (i) hybrids between crop and wild lettuce (Lactuca
sativa and L. serriola, resp.) as a model for crop/wild
hybridisation, and (ii) Brassica napus as a model feral
system. We speciﬁcally focus on abiotic stress related
to salinity and drought.
Tasks The project focuses on experiments using diﬀer-
ent types of manipulations: changes to the local densi-
ties of plants, establishing new populations within and
outside the current range, and creating experimental
populations in ˆ aoasesˆ a where they are not exposed to
the stress of the surrounding environment (no trans-
genic plants will be introduced to the ﬁeld). The work
involves designing experiments, selecting and creating
experimental plots, collecting data, speciﬁcally on the
impact of the experiment on other species (pollinators,
herbivores) and statistical analyses of the results. Re-
sults will be published in peer-reviewed journals.
Requirements ˆ a Master in biology, with emphasis on
population genetics, evolutionary biology or plant phys-
iology ˆ a Good training in the planning, execution and

PhD Student Positions - Evolutionary/Functional Ge-
nomics
Two PhD student positions in Evolutionary and Func-
tional Genomics are available at the University of Mu-
nich. The students will join a collaborative research
group studying natural selection in structured popula-
tions and be enrolled in the Munich Graduate School
for Evolution, Ecology and Sytematics (EESLMU). The
speciﬁc projects are:
1) Selection on expression variation at the B4galnt2
gene in natural populations of house mice (Dr. John
Baines). Variation in the tissue-speciﬁc expression pat-
tern of B4galnt2, a glycosyltransferase, is associated
with a phenotype in mice that closely resembles a com-
mon human bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease.
This project aims to understand the evolutionary forces
governing this variation and will include a large-scale
geographic survey of alleles conferring alternative ex-
pression patterns and an analysis of metagenomic sam-
ples from wild-caught mice.
2) Gene expression variation in natural populations of
Drosophila (Dr. John Parsch). This project will use
microarray analysis to investigate gene expression vari-
ation in Drosophila melanogaster, with particular fo-
cus on adaptive regulatory changes between ecologically
diﬀerentiated populations. It will also include DNA se-
quence analysis and transgenic experiments to study
the evolution of gene regulatory elements.
The University of Munich has a strong, interactive
group in evolutionary biology, including theoreticians
and experimentalists working on both plant and animal
systems. We have an international group and the every-
day working language is English. The Department of
Biology is housed in the new, state-of-the-art BioCenter
on the University of Munich High-Tech campus. More
information is available on the web at:

will receive a salary according to the German pay scale
(E13/2 TV-L). Applicants should have a master’s de-
gree or equivalent in biology or a related ﬁeld. In addi-
tion, laboratory experience in molecular biology and/or
genetics is desired. Interested candidates should send a

PHD POSITION IN PLANT EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY
A Ph.D. position in plant evolutionary Biology is avail-
able at the Dept. Structural and Functional Biology,
University of Naples Federico II, Italy, with Dr. Sal-
vatore Cozzolino to study speciation and reproductive
isolation in Mediterranean orchids.
I am seeking a PhD candidate (3 yrs) with a strong
interest in the evolution of reproductive isolation and
speciation in plants. Our group is using orchids as a
model system for ecological genetics and current re-
search topics include hybridisation and introgression,
habitat adaptation, reproductive isolation and specia-
tion, mechanisms and consequences of speciﬁc pollina-
tor attraction, genome evolution. For this PhD position
two possible research projects are available. The two
projects are embedded in a larger framework of evo-
lutionary studies in Mediterranean orchids. For both
projects, experience with experimental work and sta-
tistical analyses and the use and application of molec-
ular methods to evolutionary problems are a must.
One project will focus on the characterization of genes
involved in species isolation by pollen-stigma interac-
tions, by transcript proﬁling and functional study of
candidate genes. For this project I am looking for one
candidate with a strong background in molecular biol-
ogy or biochemistry and plant developmental biology.
The second project will investigate mechanisms and
consequences of speciﬁc pollinator attraction in orchids
species-pair, involving investigations on ﬂoral signals
(scent), behavioural experiments, molecular analysis of
hybrid zones with pollinators and plot experiments in
the ﬁeld. For this project , a background in evolution-
ary ecology and population genetics is desirable.

PhD Students Proposals Selection of candidates for a
PhD grant proposal to submit to the Portuguese Foun-
dation for Science and Technology
We accept applicants for a PhD grant proposal to be
submitted to the Portuguese Foundation for the Science
and Technology under the following topics:
1. “A molecular genomic approach to unravel the evo-
lution of natural toxins”. Gene families, which encode
toxins, are found in many marine animals (from deadly
poisoning jellyﬁshes to sea snakes), yet there is lim-
ited understanding of their evolution at the nucleotide
level and the evolutionary signiﬁcance of their protein
mutations. Understanding the evolution of ecological
specialization is important for making inferences about22 EvolDir August 1, 2008
the origins of natural toxins biodiversity.
2.ˆAGenomic diversity of proto-eukaryotes symbiosis ˆA.
Harvesting light to produce energy and oxygen (photo-
synthesis) is the signature of all land plants. This abil-
ity was co-opted from a precocious and ancient form
of life known as cyanobacteria. The most widespread
cyanobacterial symbiosis is that of plastids in eukary-
otes that happened more than 2 billion years ago. How-
ever, much more recent episodes of symbioses occurred
between cyanobacteria and eukaryotic hosts, both non-
photosynthetic (from marine sponges to ascidians) and
photosynthetic (from diatoms to the ﬂowering plants)
hosts. Characterizing the evolutionary mechanism un-
derlying such genetic cooperation is fundamental to un-
derstanding the origin of genomic symbiosis.
3.ˆAGlobal phylogeny and biogeography of cyanobac-
teria species ˆA. It is much debated whether microorgan-
isms are easily dispersed globally or whether they, like
many macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies.
Recent ﬁndings using faster evolving genetic markers in
protozoa species revealed considerable genetic structure
and suggested that protest biodiversity may be signiﬁ-
cantly higher than previously thought.
4. ˆAGenomic research on the chimerical origin of
Eukaryotic genomes ˆA. Eukaryotic genomes are replete
with genes of eubacterial ancestry, namely from the
Cyanobacteria, the Proteobacteria, and the Thermo-
plasmatales. These signals correspond to distinct sym-
biotic partners involved in eukaryote evolution: plas-
tids, mitochondria, and the elusive host lineage. Eval-
uating the evolutionary relationships between such an-
cient relationships is important for making inferences
about the origins and diversiﬁcation of life.
5.ˆAA genome-wide sequencing study to characterize
genes responsible for the development and adaptation
in Vertebrates ˆA. Major phenotypic changes in verte-
brates (from mammals to ﬁsh), occurred by the evolu-
tion of various gene products over the last half billion
years. Understanding the genetic basis of the diversiﬁ-
cation of development genes in vertebrates can provide
fundamental biological insight about species evolution,
ecological ﬁtness, and genetic diseases.
The granted candidates will have a monthly salary
of 980 euros and will develop their work at CIMAR,
University of Porto, Portugal ( http://www.cimar.org/-
). The candidates should have a B.S. or Graduation
in Biology, Biochemistry or other related ﬁelds with a

ComputationalEvolBiol
PhD position avaliable in the Computational Evolu-
tionary Biology group at the Department of Bioinfor-
matics of the University of Wuerzburg.
In a BMBF funded project, we want to compare the
evolution of genomes with the development of lan-
guages. We want to address questions like the follow-
ing: Why can the meaning of the word ’Augenblick’
not be deduced from the words ’Auge’ and ’Blick’?
How does the function of two genes change, if they are
fused? Why does nobody use the word ’unvorgreiﬂich’
any longer? Is the rate of gene loss comparable to that
of vanishing words? Are the diﬀerences between di-
alects in bavarian villages comparable to those in the
genomes of diﬀerent persons?
We are looking for a biologist with a strong background
in bioinformatics or a bioinformatician. Experience
in the analysis of genomic data is a plus. The can-
didate should have a general interest in evolutionary
questions and should become acquainted with linguis-
tics. Language data will be analysed in close collab-
oration with linguists from diﬀerent insitutes (Univer-
sity W¨ urzburg, University Trier, Institut fuer deutsche
Sprache Mannheim). As all language data are in ger-
man, strong command of german language is a require-
ment.
The position is funded by the BMBF for three
years. Interested sudents should email their CVAugust 1, 2008 EvolDir 23

PhD position at University of Zurich: Systems biology
on ecosystems
The project is oﬀered as an Interdisciplinary
PhD (IPhD) Fellowship program of SystemsX.ch,24 EvolDir August 1, 2008
which is Swiss-wide network of systems biology
(www.systemsx.ch ). The project, entitled “Systems
biology on ecosystems: exploring the mechanism of
synchronized ﬂowering by integrating molecular and
modeling approaches ” is supervised by three groups:
(1) Kentaro Shimizu, Evolutionary Functional Ge-
nomics, Institute of Plant Biology, University of Zurich
(http://botserv1.uzh.ch/home/shimizu/index.html,
http://www.imcr.uzh.ch/systembio/shimizu.html ).
(2) Akiko Satake, Theoretical Biology, Hokkaido
University, Japan, as an international collaborator
(http://www.cris.hokudai.ac.jp/satake/en/index.html,
moved from EAWAG recently) (3) Andreas Wag-
ner, Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,
Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich
(http://www.bioc.uzh.ch/wagner/ ).
Self-organized synchrony between diﬀerent biological
components has been identiﬁed in many biological sys-
tems. Synchronized ﬂowering in tropical rain forests,
called “general ﬂowering”, is considered one of the
most mysterious and large-scale events in ecosystems.
Tree samples will be collected in tropical rain forest in
Malaysia and in temperate forest in Japan, and quan-
titative gene expression pattern regarding ﬂowing is
assayed by using the genomic information of a model
species Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on those data, we
will construct a network structure of genes that regu-
late ﬂowering timing, and then develop a dynamic gene
network model to predict the degree of synchrony in re-
sponse to various extent of water-stress and nutrients.
Ecological robustness of synchronous ﬂowering against
global warming will also be studied. A 454-type ultra-
high throughput sequencer (deep sequencer) introduced
recently in Functional Genomics Center Zurich (FGCZ,
http://www.fgcz.ethz.ch/ ) will be exploited.
Comment: Diploma, Master or equivalent in biol-
ogy, bioinformatics, ecology is preferred. This project
requires both computer modeling and molecular ex-
periments in order to analyze large-scale expression
data. Experience in at least one of them, and
strong motivation to learn another is preferred. In-
terdisciplinary training in MLS or PSC program of
Life Science Zurich Graduate School ( www.lifescience-
graduateschool.ch/ ) is oﬀered. In addition, Sys-
temsX.ch ( www.systemsx.ch ) will provide courses.
Remarks: Please send your CV including a description
of your practical experience, grades, your scientiﬁc in-
terests, and the names and the contact address of two
references in English, preferably by E-mail. The review
of the applications will start in Aug 2008, and contin-
ues until the position is ﬁlled. The salary follows the
regulation of Swiss National Foundation.Contact: send your application both

versity of Alaska Museum (UAM) houses the deﬁnitive
collection of birds from northwesternmost North Amer-
ica and also includes important holdings from major
relevant wintering areas. Located in a region that has
never had a formal biological survey, this collection has
tripled in size during the past decade to about 25,000
specimens; it is an exciting time to be a specimen-based
ornithologist.
The Collection Manager is responsible for the daily
management and development of the Bird Collection,
which includes the multiple preparation types typical of
modern collections. Duties include all aspects of collec-
tion growth and management, such as permitting, col-
lecting expeditions, specimen acquisition and prepara-
tion, cataloguing and databasing, maintenance, loans,
public inquiries and tours, purchasing and budget man-
agement, supervision of students and volunteers, and
managing the use of the collection. The Collection
Manager will assist the Curator in writing proposals
and reports of collections-based activities and will also
promote the Collection through public outreach, ex-
hibits, reports, and presentations at meetings when ap-
propriate.
Minimum qualiﬁcations include an advanced degree in
an appropriate discipline and experience in specimen-
based ornithology (including museum experience),
specimen collection and preparation, formal communi-
cations on specimen-based science, and data manage-
ment.
The UA Museum is housed in a newly expanded
and renovated building on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Alaska Fairbanks, just south of the
Arctic Circle in Interior Alaska. More infor-
mation can be found www.uaf.edu/museum/ and
www.uaf.edu/museum/bird/. Fairbanks has ready ac-cess to incredible outdoor opportunities, and as the sec-
ond largest population center in Alaska, it has impor-
tant cultural, artistic, and recreational opportunities
not often available in a community of its size.
Salary begins at about $48,588 per year with full uni-
versity beneﬁts.
To apply, please submit an application and curriculum
vitae, a collections management statement, and the
names and contact information of three references by 12

UYork PlantPhylogeography
Dear all
The York Institute for Tropical Ecosystem Dynamics
(KITE) is seeking to appoint a Senior Research Fellow
to work within the KITE project, ideally within the
area of plant phylogeography.
The successful applicant will use DNA sequence data
to investigate the historical biogeography of tropical
forest forming species in an East African biodiversity
hotspot, the Eastern Arc Mountains. He/she will work
as part of a multidisciplinary team integrating mod-
elling studies, palaeoecological, phytosociological, and
phylogenetic data to examine past, present and future
impacts of environmental change within the region. As
such, this work will have a particular focus on investi-
gating the age and divergence of mountain forest pop-
ulations relative to the wider region in the context
of investigating hypothesised impacts of past climatic
changes. This project will utilise existing published and
unpublished chloroplast sequence data, in combination
with further data to be derived from ﬁeld samples and
herbarium specimens. Candidates must be experienced
in molecular lab work and sequence-based phylogenetic
data analysis.
Full details can be found on the University of York

Research Assistant in Plant Evolutionary Genetics
A research assistant is needed to conduct experiments
in the Busch laboratory at Washington State University
(WSU). The Busch laboratory conducts experiments in
plant evolutionary genetics, with a particular empha-
sis on the evolution of mating systems and their ge-
netic consequences. Experiments are currently focus-
ing on species of Leavenworthia, a genus of mustards
that are endemic to the southeastern United States. An
independent and highly motivated individual is being
sought to conduct independent research in the follow-
ing two areas: 1) an examination of genetic incompati-
bilities contributing to reproductive isolation in hybrid
oﬀspring produced in crosses between populations of a
self-fertilizing species; and 2) PCR ampliﬁcation of mi-
crosatellite loci to study the eﬀects of mating system on
population structure in several Leavenworthia species.
Field trips to collect natural material may also be re-
quired, so the candidate should be comfortable collect-
ing plant material in the ﬁeld. The ideal candidate will
have recently graduated from University with a B.A. or
B.S. in biology, in addition to having experience con-
ducting independent research in a laboratory. Experi-
ence with molecular techniques (PCR, electrophoresis,
cloning, etc.) is an asset but not a requirement for em-
ployment. Responsibilities of the position include main-
tenance and oversight of the laboratory (25%), growth
of plant material, experimental crosses, and measure-
ment of plant traits in a greenhouse (35%), in addition
to PCR ampliﬁcation and analysis of polymorphic DNA
(40%).
Interested individuals should submit a one-page letter
outlining why the position is being sought to Jeremiah
Busch at jwbusch@wsu.edu. Applicants must also pro-
vide the email addresses and phone numbers of three
references in their letter. The position is to be ﬁlled
for one year, although employment for a second year
may be oﬀered upon satisfactory performance. Appli-
cations will be accepted and screened until September
1st, 2008. The starting salary is $25,000, although this
amount is negotiable based upon prior experience. The
position is expected to start on January 5th, 2009.
Washington State University is housed in Pullman,
Washington, a small town with strong school systems40 EvolDir August 1, 2008

ABI 5x sequencing buﬀer
For years we used to make our own 5x sequencing buﬀer
for doing cycle sequencing with BigDye. However, for
the last couple of years ABI (hum Darth Vader’s theme
here) started shipping 5x buﬀer with the BigDye. Re-
cently we ran out so we ﬁgured we’d be lazy and order
some from ABI (hum Darth Vader’s theme here). They
quoted us nearly $1000 for 28mL of the stuﬀ. Now, my
recollection is that the 5x buﬀer was simply a solutionof 400mM tris and 10 mM MgCl. However, I think this
was back in the days of BigDye3.0. Does anyone make
their own 5x buﬀer for bigdye 3.1. I doubt there is any
reason that the buﬀer costs more than gold.

ABI 5x sequencing buﬀer answers
Thanks to all who sent in helpful responses to my query
regarding the ABI 5x sequencing buﬀer. It appears that
most people use the following recipe. Indeed it seems
that it is just 400mM Tris, and 10mM MgCl2, pH 9.0
solution, making it one of the most expensive saltwater
solutions in the world.
Some of the more helpful responses are pasted below.
If you’re buying this from ABI, you should complain to
the bitterly about their exploitive business practices.

Gel scoring software
Dear Evoldir Members!
I ampliﬁed ITS regions by a PCR based approach and
ran amplicons (not labelled with ﬂuroscence) on a 10%
PAGE gel with asize standard. I obatined diﬀerent
genotypes (based on their length variation) at a par-
ticular region of interest. I have them all as gel im-
ages (TIFF format). Currently I am looking for a soft-
ware program (possibly a freeware) that facilitates me
in scoring bands from a normal PAGE gel image. I
would like to score them as either presence or absence
of bands (0 or 1) and calculate genetic diversity like we
do in a AFLP. I would be highly obliged ifany of you
could provide me suggestions on the above.

Informative AFLP markers
Dear EvolDir Members,
I work on a large-scale population-level project with
over 2000 samples, using AFLP. In order to reduce the
laborious scoring of AFLP proﬁles I’d like to select the
most informative AFLP markers. I was wandering if
any of you have experience with this and can recom-
mend an approach/software/procedure etc.
I have already scored selected panel of about 150 sam-
ples in 9 primer combinations used and this gener-
ated over 400 AFLP markers. I was hoping that if
we could select less markers/primer combinations that
would give us nearly the same results I could substan-
tially reduce time spent by scoring and use it for sub-
sequent data analysis. Please note that most of the
samples are already lab-analysed in all 9 primer com-
binations so I’m not looking for cutting down the cost
of lab-work.
Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!
Best wishes, Sarka

Microsat software and
individual-based trees
Dear all,I have recently tried to calculate individual-based trees
using the Microsat software by Minch et al. This soft-
ware produces frequency and distance ﬁles on diploid
data (with bootrapping if wanted) that can be im-
ported into PHYLIP. Unfortunately, the software is no
longer supported, and my version is not working any-
more. Creating individual-based frequency input ﬁles
for PHYLIP is possible but very exhausting, and be-
sides Microsat has a far wider range of possible dis-
tances (apart from the usual three that PHYLIP of-
fers).
Does anybody know of an alternative software instead
of Microsat? Individual-based trees are very popular,
and indeed they oﬀer exciting results sometimes. It
would be a great loss not to be able to do this any
longer.
Any help would be gratefully appreciated!
Best wishes,
Frank

Microsat software and
individual-based trees answers
Dear all,
I have received many very helpful answers and com-
ments regarding my query about software programmes
with the option of constructing individual-based dis-
tance ﬁles and or trees.
The take-home message of all these answers was that
I should go for either the MSA (Microsatellite Anal-
yser) software by Dieringer and Schl¨ otterer, which of-
fers many options not implemented in Microsat but re-
quires a particular inﬁle, or the programme Popula-
tions by Langella, which also covers individual-based
distances and trees.
I would very much like to thank all who have enlight-
ened me on this matter your help was very valuable to
me!

Pinned insect DNA
Dear Evoldir Listers,
For project planning purposes, I’m attempting to es-
tablish what is a typical level of success for obtaining
DNA sequence from pinned museum specimens of in-
sects of various ages. To compile this information from
the literature is virtually impossible, as most studies
don’t give data on the specimens they were unable to
sequence.
If any of you have experience in this area, I’d be inter-
ested to know what taxonomic group you are working
on, what gene region and length of DNA fragment, av-
erage age of specimens and percentage of samples that
sequenced successfully. Approximate numbers are OK.
If you know collecting/killing methods that information
would also be useful.

Plantago seed request
Dear all,
For a project on plasticity and ecological amplitude of
native and introduced plant populations, we are look-
ing for seed material from native and introduced pop-
ulations of /Plantago lanceolata/, /Lactuca serriola/,
/Holcus lanatus/ and /Capsella bursa-pastoris/. All
four species are native to Europe, and now have an al-
most worldwide distribution.If you know some populations of any of these four
species, and would be willing to send us seeds, together
with information on the location of the population (lat-
itude, longitude, altitude), we would very much appre-
ciate it. From each population, we would like to have,
when possible, seeds from ten diﬀerent plant individu-
als, separated by at least 1 m. The seeds should ideally
be kept separately for each individual. However, if it is
too laborious to pack the seeds separately, we are also
happy with bulked seeds.

RNAlater expiration date
Hi all,
I have some tubes with unused RNAlater that date back
to March 2007. They were stored at room temperature.
According to the product documentation, RNAlater is
storable for only about a year. Does anyone have any
experience of using RNAlater that has been stored for
longer than a year? Given the price of the chemical
I hoped to be able to use the old vials, but of course
I don’t want to risk to loose samples just because I’m
stingy... Any advice or experiences would be greatly
appreciated!

Rotting fruit samples for
Caenorhabditis
Dear all,
This is a call for rotting fruit samples from all around
the world (especially outside Western Europe and US-
Canada) to ﬁnd Caenorhabditis species.
Caenorhabditis nematodes proliferate in rotting fruits
that have fallen on soil below their tree (and are also
found on snails, isopods, etc. that probably carry
them to the fruits - cf. Barriere and Felix, Genetics
2007). Curiously pretty much the same as Drosophila
and yeasts.... In the past years, 8 new Caenorhabditis
species were found - in China, Portugal, US, Ghana,
India, La Reunion and Guyana. With other colleagues,
we also study the distribution and genetic structure of
the diﬀerent species, so we are also interested in getting
the “old” ones, like C. elegans or C. briggsae. From
the recent surge in new species since we sample rotting
fruits, we are probably very far from exhausting the
diversity of species around the world.
If you or somone you know are living or trav-
eling outside of “Western” Europe (mostly
France/UK/Germany; even Ireland, Italy or Scan-
dinavia need sampling!) and US/Canada, I would
be interested that you sample rotting fruits /vegeta-
bles/ﬂowers (either wild or cultivated, below their
tree). Samples of about 10-20 ml are good. They need
to travel in aerated containers so that they don’t start
fermenting and depleting the oxygen, for example in
plastic bags or 10-50 ml tubes which are not airtight
(cap slightly unscrewed, or small hole in it). I could
get worms out after 2-3 weeks of travel, provided they
are not heated too much.
Note there is a prize for ﬁnding a sister species
to C. elegans (cash + the right to propose a
name). http://www.wormbase.org/mt/wormbase/-
archives/2007/09/11/10.14.02/ If you send the key
sample, you’ll get it....48 EvolDir August 1, 2008

Sequencer advice
Hello - we are a group of three researchers that are
purchasing a low to medium throughput sequencer for
DNA sequencing and microsatellite genotyping. Be-
cause of the relatively low volume, ABI sequencers
don’t make sense for us, so we are contemplating
a LI-COR (400 DNA Analyser) or Beckman-Coulter
(GenomeLab GeXP).
Does anyone have any experience with either of these
machines/manufacturers for both sequencing and geno-
typing? We have heard conﬂicting opinions from
our own colleagues about the eﬃcacy of these ma-
chines/manufacturers, and would like to know what the
greater community thinks of these choices.
Many thanks.

Software bms runner 1 2Dear EvolDir,
bms runner is free software to predict functional linkage
among gene products, on the basis of correlated gain
and loss of genes from genomes (Barker et al. 2007). It
does this by helping the user to conﬁgure and repeat-
edly launch the separate BayesTraits program (Pagel et
al. 2004).
bms runner version 1.2 has just been released, with im-
portant improvements. bms runner works under Linux
or Mac OS X. It may be downloaded here:
http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/cegg/software.html I
will be happy to receive any questions and feedback
on bms runner.

Software ForSim
ForwardEvolutionarySimulation
We have produced a forward evolutionary computer
simulation package, called *ForSim*, that can be used
to simulate many aspects of the evolution of single or
multilocus traits in diploid organisms, and also provide
test data that can be used by to evaluate study design
and other inferential questions in gene association, link-
age, or heterogeneity studies. The program is forward
rather than backward (coalescent), to allow minimal re-
liance on formal theory and maximum ﬂexibility. This
program tries to mimic natural evolution by phenotype,
rather than assigning ﬁtness or net phenotypic eﬀects
directly to individual genes. *ForSim *is not intended
as competition with any other evolutionary simulation
programs; each has its uses.
Users can specify many diﬀerent conditions, includ-
ing environmental eﬀects; population size(s) and
growth, subdivision histories with or without gene ﬂow;
phenotype-based mate choice or migration; various
forms of natural selection (including none); mutation
eﬀect size distributions; and many other things. Indi-August 1, 2008 EvolDir 49
vidual or multiple phenotypes can be simulated, that
are aﬀected by separate or overlapping sets of genes.
Many situations not explicitly built into the program
can be achieved by creative speciﬁcation in the input
ﬁle.
Users can also control how much output detail they
want at the end or at speciﬁable points during the sim-
ulation, but standard output includes the entire simu-
lated population(s) with phenotypes and phased geno-
types for each individual, 3 (or more)-generational pedi-
grees, case-control samples, parent-oﬀspring trios for
tagSNP/LD testing, and a variety of diagnostic and
analytic graphical ﬁles.
*ForSim* is entirely open-source. It’s written in C++,
and uses wrapper pre- and post-processing scripts
written in Ruby. It has been tested on a variety
of Unix/Linux/MacOS (32 or 64 bit) platforms, and
should also run under Windows (such as with CygWin
etc.), but we have not tested that. For full current
functionality, the installation should also have available
*R*for statistics, ClustalW for haplotype alignments,
and Haploview for LD and tagSNP analysis.
This program is brieﬂy described in *Bioinformat-
ics* (online: “*ForSim*: a tool for exploring the ge-
netic architecture of complex traits with controlled
truth.” *Bioinformatics*, doi 10.1093/bioinformat-
ics/btn317). The user Manual is browsable from
http://www.anthro.psu.edu/weiss lab/research.shtml
*ForSim *is available free, conditional on a non-
commercialization open-source software agreement.
The distribution tar ﬁle includes the program, an instal-
lation README ﬁle, the extensive user Manual, and a
few other utilities. Of course, any software can have
bugs, and we will issue revisions to registered users as
they are caught. New ﬂexibilities are planned for sub-
sequent versions, depending on funding.
Anyone interested in trying or using *ForSim* should
contact Brian Lambert (bwl1(at)psu.edu), or me (ken-
weiss(at)psu.edu).

Software LAMARC 2 1 3
We have just released version 2.1.3 of LAMARC. The
LAMARC program estimates population parameters
such as eﬀective population size, migration rates, pop-
ulation growth rates and recombination rate from sam-
ples of molecular data.
The 2.1.3 release ﬁxes an error in haplotype phase infer-
ence. Analyses which used this feature in versions 2.1.2
and 2.1.2b should be rerun. A symptom of this bug is
very high acceptance rates for phase-reassessment up-
dates. Runs which did not attempt phase inference are
not aﬀected.
We have also made several small improvements:
TRACER-compatible output is now usable even when
the number of steps is very large.
Mapping output from gene-mapping runs is now writ-
ten to a separate ﬁle, rather than lumped in with the
parameter estimation output; this makes automation of
mapping runs much easier.
A more recent version (2.8.8) of the wxWidgets graph-
ics library has been used, increasing the chance that
the graphical data converter will run correctly on di-
verse computer systems.
The new release of LAMARC can be downloaded from
our web site:
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc.html It is
freely available, but please register so that we’ll know
how many people are using the software.

Volunteer/ﬁeld assistant to study group and grouping
decisions in House Sparrows
For 4 months: from the end of October 2008 until be-
fore Xmas and from the beginning of January until the
ﬁrst week of March 2009.
I seek a highly motivated volunteer/ﬁeld assistant to
help us with ﬁeldwork. Our study site is located in the
foothills of the Pyrenees in southern France. This sea-
son we will experimentally investigate group and group-
ing decisions in house sparrows. Since we will catch
and ring frequently, ringing experience and familiarity
of handling birds would be a merit. Field assistants are
expected to be able to work independent and willing
to take responsibility. We will work 5 days per week
and it would be helpful to have drivers licence. Basic
knowledge of French or Basque language will facilitate
the work in the ﬁeld since we frequently interact with
the locals to catch birds around farm houses.
The study site is located close to the Pyrenees (ca. 15
km oﬀ St. Jean Pied du Port) in a small valley which is
unaﬀected by tourism and is an excellent wildlife spot
on one of the major European bird migration routes.
The study site is within an hour’s drive of the airports
of Biarritz and Pau.
Qualiﬁcations: 1) Bachelors or MSc in biology or simi-
lar qualiﬁcation 2) Sociable personality and motivated.
3) Willing to work outside 5 days per week. The cli-
mate at the study site during winter is mild and snow
fall rarely. 4) Drivers licence would be useful 5) Used
to handle animals, bird banding experience would be a
plus.
The project will cover transport to and within study
site, accommodation and food. Assistants with exten-
sive bird banding or ﬁeld work experience will be paid
a salary of up to 500 per month.

Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by Natural Selec-
tion is the basis of Biology and the Spanish Society for
Evolutionary Biology (SESBE) has the goal of promot-
ing and spreading Evolutionary Theory in Spain. Three
years after its launching, the society has consolidated its
main media, the electronic journal eVoluci ˜A3n, has pro-
moted several popularizing activities and discussions
about evolution, and generated many documents avail-
able for scientists, teachers and those interested in Biol-
ogy in general (available through the society’s web site,
www.sesbe.org <http://www.sesbe.org/ >. Now that
the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of “On
The Origin of Species” is about to start, the SESBE
has launched the SESBE Collection on Evolutionary
Biology, a series of books by experts in the diﬀerent
areas of knowledge inﬂuenced by Evolutionary Theory.
Today, the SESBE announces the publication of the
ﬁrst volume in this collection, “Current challenges of
Darwinism, a theory in crisis?” by Juan Moreno Klem-
ing (from the Natural History Museum – Museo de His-
toria Natural-CSIC).

Sterilizing plant pots
I would like to re-use lots of pots that have contained
Mimulus, but want to make sure that they don’t con-
tain viable seeds. These are pretty cheap plastic, so au-
toclaving is out of the question. The seeds (belonging
to the family Scrophulariaceae, or Phrymaceae, what-
ever), are very small, e.g., to get a good look at them
requires about a 5x or more magniﬁcation. So I was
thinking maybe a 10% Clorox (sodium hypochlorite)
soaking for 10-15 minutes followed by a thorough rins-
ing with fresh water would do the trick to avoid con-
tamination. Does anyone have any advice about this?
Thanks, Jeﬀ Dole jadole@berkeley.edu

PHD POSITION IN PLANT EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY
A Ph.D. position in plant evolutionary Biology is avail-
able at the Dept. Structural and Functional Biology,
University of Naples Federico II, Italy, with Dr. Sal-
vatore Cozzolino to study speciation and reproductive
isolation in Mediterranean orchids. I am seeking a PhD
candidate (3 yrs) with a strong interest in the evolu-
tion of reproductive isolation and speciation in plants.
Our group is using orchids as a model system for eco-
logical genetics and current research topics include hy-
bridisation and introgression, habitat adaptation, re-
productive isolation and speciation, mechanisms and
consequences of speciﬁc pollinator attraction, genome
evolution. For this PhD position two possible research
projects are available. The two projects are embed-
ded in a larger framework of evolutionary studies in
Mediterranean orchids. For both projects, experience
with experimental work and statistical analyses and the
use and application of molecular methods to evolution-
ary problems are a must. One project will focus on the
characterization of genes involved in species isolation by
pollen-stigma interactions, by transcript proﬁling and
functional study of candidate genes. For this project
I am looking for one candidate with a strong back-
ground in molecular biology or biochemistry and plant
developmental biology. The second project will investi-
gate mechanisms and consequences of speciﬁc pollina-
tor attraction in orchids species-pair, involving inves-
tigations on ﬂoral signals (scent), behavioural experi-
ments, molecular analysis of hybrid zones with pollina-
tors and plot experiments in the ﬁeld. For this project
, a background in evolutionary ecology and popula-
tion genetics is desirable. The Dept. Structural and
Functional Biology (see <http://www.dbsf.unina.it/-August 1, 2008 EvolDir 53
>http://www.dbsf.unina.it/ ) host 40 academic staﬀ,
a dozen of PostDoc, and 20 PhD students that inves-
tigate several biological topics and oﬀers a supportive
and stimulating environment, a state-of-the-art molec-
ular labs, as well as climate chambers, greenhouses and
common garden facilities. Naples has a large and very
active research community and the University of Naples
(www.unina.it ) dealing with various aspects of organ-
ismal and molecular biology. The city also oﬀers excel-
lent opportunity for social life through active cultural
programs and infrastructure, as well as an attractive
surrounding including both see and mountains in prox-
imity. Funding is available for three years and we hope
to appoint by October 2008. Candidates should have
completed their Masters degree or equivalent (Diplom)
in a relevant ﬁeld and be very ﬂuent in English. The
closing date for applications is end August 2008. A
letters of application, together with a full CV and the
names of two referees should be sent by email to Dr

WillowSawﬂy samplesHi all,
I am a PhD student working on the willow sawﬂy (/Ne-
matus oligospilus/, family: Tenthredinidae) in Aus-
tralia. The willow sawﬂy originates from North Amer-
ica (from Ireland to Southern Alaska to Mexico) and
Europe (from Ireland to the Himalayas) and has be-
come invasive in the southern hemisphere.
I am currently looking for samples from the northern
hemisphere. If anyone come across a willow and ﬁnd
sawﬂy larvae, I would be extremely grateful if these
could be preserved and make their way to this side of
the world. I can pay for shipping.
You can contact me for more infor-

BrownU Phylogenomics
I am currently seeking a postdoctoral researcher in-
terested in the conceptual and practical problems of
analyzing phylogenetic data from whole genomes and
ESTs. This work will build on a recently pub-
lished animal phylogeny ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/-
nature06614 ) that considered 150 genes from 77 broadly
sampled taxa, including 29 animals for which we col-
lected new EST data. The primary research focus
will be on homology identiﬁcation (based largely on
graph- theory approaches to building clusters of sim-
ilar genes from pairwise similarity data) and paralogy
evaluation (through phylogenetic methods). The post-
doc will explore various theoretical aspects of these and
related problems, and take part in the authorship of
open- source software tools that will facilitate large-
scale phylogenomic projects in labs without the exper-
tise to build these tools from scratch. It is hoped that
the successful candidate will take the initiative to in-
vestigate and build tools for other new challenges that
are arising with the the growing use of high-throughput
sequencing for phylogenetic problems. The candidate
would be encouraged to get involved on the ﬁeld, or-
ganismal, and wet-lab aspects of the research program
if they so desire.
A thorough understanding of phylogenetic theory and
extensive experience in the phylogenetic analysis of
molecular data are essential. Strong unix skills, pro-
ﬁciency with one or more computer languages, and fa-
miliarity with relational databases are also required.
The position will remain open until ﬁlled, with the
successful candidate starting as soon as is possible for
them. Please send a cover letter outlining your interestin the project, a current c.v., and contact information
for 3 professional references to casey dunn@brown.edu

CornellU RapidEvolution
We invite applications from prospective postdoctoral
candidates to join our research project, “Contempo-
rary Rapid Evolution: Dynamics and Persistence in
Complex Ecological Communities”, supported by the
James S. McDonnell Foundation. Interested candi-
dates should contact us directly (Nelson Hairston, Jr.,
ngh1@cornell.edu; Stephen Ellner, spe2@cornell.edu)
with a brief statement of your background and interests,
attaching your CV and providing contact information
for 2 persons who could provide letters of reference.
Our broad goal is to understand the proximate and ulti-
mate factors responsible for general patterns of popula-56 EvolDir August 1, 2008
tion variability, such as the ubiquity of stability and cy-
cles and the rarity of more complex dynamical patterns.
Work to date has centered on predator-prey (rotifer-
algal) microcosms having the potential to exhibit a wide
range of qualitative dynamics. Tightly linked experi-
mental and theoretical studies have allowed us to show
that feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary pro-
cesses play an essential role in determining the system’s
dynamic properties. Future directions for experimen-
tal and theoretical work include: relationships between
genetic variability and ecological dynamics; more com-
plex experimental communities; management implica-
tions of rapid evolution; and extending the work to nat-
ural aquatic communities. Additional information is at
www.jsmf.org/grants/d.php?id 07006.
We can provide at least 2 years of postdoc salary with
a start date as early at September 1, 2008 and as late
as January 1, 2009. The postdoc will have primary
responsibility for planning and conducting microcosm
experiments and for training and supervising under-
graduate assistants on the project, but will be a full
participant in all aspects of the project, both theoreti-
cal and experimental. Previous experience with aquatic
microcosm/mesocosms will be helpful, but is not essen-
tial.

ESF Programme ThermAdapt
short-visit-exchange
***** PERMANENT CALL FOR SHORT-VISIT &
EXCHANGE GRANT APPLICATIONS *****
In 2006 we launched a new ESF Programme on “Ther-
mal adaptation in ectotherms: Linking life history,
physiology, behaviour and genetics” (ThermAdapt); see
http://www.esf.org/thermadapt . The Objective of
this ESF Programme is to foster a multidisciplinary
European network of scientists working on thermal
adaptation. We particularly aim to integrate research
at multiple levels of investigation, including genetics,
physiology, ecology, behaviour or theory. Interested
persons or groups are encouraged to join our activities.
These include advertising their expertise via our web
site, and participation in various activities to be an-
nounced separately and regularly over the next 5 years
such as workshops, training courses, short and long ex-
change grants, exchange of specimens and expertise,
sharing of facilities, and scientiﬁc collaboration of any
kind.
We PERMANENTLY call for applications for
==>Short Visit ( <15 days) and Exchange Grants (15
days - 3 months)There is no particular deadline. Instead, submission of
grant proposals is now PERMANENTLY OPENED,
as explained on our web site http://www.esf.org/-
thermadapt under >Grants, where the application pro-
cedure is also outlined. These grants are competitive
and open for all ranks (including MSc/PhD students).
We shall periodically review submissions about every 3
to 4 months.
Proposals should be broadly related to the scientiﬁc
objectives of the Programme. Short Visits may serve
for planning collaborative research projects, brief data
gathering or data analysis. The longer-term Exchange
Grants typically involve planning and execution of a
larger collaborative research project (under special cir-
cumstances stays longer than 3 months may be possi-
ble).
Grant applications will be chosen based on scientiﬁc
quality, and priority will be given to applicants who
come from or intend to visit countries supporting the
programme (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Den-
mark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Nether-
lands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland), but
other European nations can be involved.

Postdoctoral Research Associate
The Natural History Museum, Department of Zoology
We are seeking to appoint a highly motivated and pro-
ductive Postdoctoral Research Associate to join a new
programme of research entitled “Developmental genes
in the life cycle of a parasitic ﬂatworm”. This work
seeks to characterize the roles of key homeotic genes
in the processes of metamorphosis and segmentation in
tapeworms and represents a major component in under-
standing the genetic processes underlying the evolution
of parasitism in ﬂatworms (see Olson. 2008. Parasitol
Int 57:8-17). The successful candidate will use gene
expression and suppression techniques in a beetle and
mouse- hosted tapeworm model to explore the roles of
Hox, ParaHox and other relevant genes (eg. -catenin).
Techniques including whole-mount and genomic ISH,
PCR-RACE, and Q-PCR will be employed, and meth-
ods for RNA interference will need to be adapted to a
cestode model.
The post is funded by the BBSRC for up to three years
and will be undertaken within the well-equipped labo-
ratories of the Natural History Museum in South Kens-
ington under the supervision of Dr Peter Olson. The
appointment will be on a Band 5 pay scale starting at
29,000 pa.
Applicants should possess a background in molecular
biology, parasitology or evolutionary developmental bi-
ology, with a Ph.D. in a related subject area. Sig-
niﬁcant experience in genetic manipulation including
RNA-based techniques and a willingness to work with
live animal cultures are prerequisites, and experience62 EvolDir August 1, 2008
with gene expression and functional genomic techniques
such as ISH and RNAi is highly desirable. The suc-
cessful applicant will have a strong publication record
and proven experience in applying one of more of these
multidisciplinary skills to a singular research question
within or outside the ﬁeld of parasitology.
Applications including a short CV, list of publica-
tions, names of three referees willing to provide a let-
ter of recommendation upon request, and a brief state-
ment on interest and qualiﬁcations should be sent to

ogy, and has strong ties to the laboratory of Ralph
Holzenthal at the University of Minnesota. We expect
that there will be a great deal of cross training avail-
able in this position, between molecular and organis-
mal biology, as well as theoretical work in alignment
and data treatment. This is an NSF-funded phyloge-
netics position, to construct a world-wide phylogeny
of Trichoptera genera. We plan to include about 500of the 600 genera of Trichoptera in a molecular and
morphological study. Although there is a sequencing
requirement, the postdoc will have time to pursue in-
dividual interests. We are looking for a creative and
independent scientist. Although we are interested in
“skills”, we are not looking for any skills in particular.
We would be just as likely to hire a skilled morpholo-
gist, who wishes to add a molecular component to their
work, as we would be likely to hire a seasoned bench
worker. Of course, molecular experience is relevant as
well, as is experience with Trichoptera, or computer
skills. We are interested in a person who might bring
new ideas, as well as familiar techniques. The posi-
tion pays about $35,000 per year, and includes health
beneﬁts. The starting time is very ﬂexible, but prefer-
ence will be given to applicants who will be ready to
start within the next 6 months. Rutgers is located in
the middle of New Jersey, between Philadelphia and
New York City. Interested candidates should send an
E-mail that outlines what they can bring to the project,
their CV, and their single most important publication
to kjer@aesop.rutgers.edu After an initial screening, we
will ask for three letters of recommendation. Applicants
are encouraged to E-mail for more details as well.

ﬁcult nature of the genetic templates, but this is a re-
warding opportunity to undertake a complete overhaul
of current ancient DNA and molecular archaeological
practice. An interest in ancient DNA, archaeology or
natural history would be very useful.
The position will be supported by a full time Tech-
nician, and will make use of the international quality

UAgarve CharophyteSystematics
Postdoc: Charophyte systematics - U of the Algarve
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral researcher
position* in charophyte systematics at Centro de Cien-
cias do Mar (CCMAR - http://www.ccmar.ualg.pt/ ),
at the University of the Algarve ( http://www.ualg.pt ).
Background The endosymbiosis of an oxgenic photo-
bacterium by a eukaryotic host cell leading to the evo-
lution of the chloroplast, and the subsequent colonisa-
tion of land by plants, were pivotal events in cell and
Earth history. The transition to land marked an un-
paralleled period of morphological and developmentalinnovation in plant form resulting in the formation of
plant-dominated terrestrial ecosystems with global en-
vironmental eﬀects. Relationships among charophyte
algae and land plants, on either side of the bound-
ary marking the transition to land, remain controver-
sial and make it diﬃcult to polarise what are thought
to be the key developmental innovations underpinning
colonisation of land.
The postdoctoral researcher will explore the morpho-
logical diversity, life-history and developmental char-
acteristics, and phylogenetic relationships among the
charophyte algae in relation to the evolutionary transi-
tion of plants to a terrestrial environment. It is essential
that the candidate have a Ph.D. and a strong back-
ground in green algal systematics and molecular phy-
logenetic methodology. Unix/Linux computing skills,
and the ability to programme in a scripting language,
would be highly advantageous.
The position is available for 3 years from January 2009
and is open to all nationalities. The researcher will re-
ceive a salary of 1495 euros/month.
Applications should be submitted before 15th August
2008 to Cymon J. Cox (cymon@ualg.pt). Applicants
should send a covering letter detailing their research
interests, a current C.V., and the email addresses for 3
professional referees. Informal enquires are welcome to

UNottingham snail chirality
Postdoctoral Research Fellow
Institute of Genetics / School of Biology, University of
NottinghamUnwinding snail chirality
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research fel-
low to work on a three-year project, funded by the BB-
SRC, on “Unwinding snail chirality”.
Although multiple lines of enquiry remain, a deep-
seated theoretical problem has stoked a burning interest
in understanding the symmetry-breaking event during
development - how is one side of an organism consis-
tently distinguished from the other, given that the side
that is called ’right’ is essentially arbitrary? Although
most prior research has concentrated on models such
as the mouse, chick and frog, we believe that the pond
Lymnaea may be a crucial organism in coming to under-
stand asymmetry, because their chirality is determined
very early in development.
The objective of this project is to take advantage of
the latest advances in DNA sequencing technology to
clone and characterize the determinant of chirality in
snails, by a novel method that we term “massive sub-
tractive linkage analysis” (MSLA). A parallel PDRA in
Professor Mark Blaxter’s lab at the University of Edin-
burgh (to be advertised separately) will lead the bioin-
formatic analyses, and there will also be collaboration
with David Lambert’s lab in Rochester, New York.
Candidates must possess a PhD in molecular genet-
ics or equivalent qualiﬁcation in a related discipline.
Experience of working with RNA and cDNA libraries
is essential, as is a meticulous approach to lab work
and note-keeping. Experience of high-precision PCR
work, genotyping, and micromanipulation of embryos
(e.g. microinjection) would also be highly desirable.
Salary range £25888 - £33780 per annum, depending
on qualiﬁcations and experience (salary can progress to
£36912 per annum subject to performance). This post
is funded by the BBSRC for a ﬁxed-term of three years,
with a provisional start date of October 1st, but with
ﬂexibility on the precise start date.

dressed to Dr. Angus Davison, tel: 0115 823

Additional information
For an organism to become asymmetric, bilateral sym-
metry must somehow be broken during development.
Although multiple lines of enquiry remain, a deep-
seated theoretical problem has stoked a burning interest
in understanding the symmetry-breaking event - how is
one side of an organism consistently distinguished from
the other, given that the side that is called ’right’ is es-
sentially arbitrary? In the hypothetical view of Brown
and Wolpert, the solution is provided by a pre-existing
asymmetric molecular reference: an asymmetric gradi-
ent is created if an ’F-molecule’ aligns with anterior-
posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, so transporting an
eﬀector molecule towards the left or right. Asymme-
try is thus entirely dependent upon the chirality (and
subsequent alignment) of the F-molecule.
To attempt to validate the hypothesis, attention has
focussed on the mouse, chick and zebraﬁsh. In these
model organisms, it has been found that rotational
beating of cilia in the early gastrula creates an asym-
metric extracellular ﬂuid movement. It has therefore
been argued that this is the symmetry-breaking step -
the chirality of cilial motor proteins leads to directional
ﬂuid movement, ultimately determining the molecular
and morphological asymmetry.
The unfortunate problem, however, is that a body of
research indicates that the symmetry-breaking event
sometimes occurs much earlier and at the intracellu-
lar level, preceding the commencement of ciliary move-
ment. Together, the results suggest that in inverte-
brates and at least some vertebrates, molecular asym-
metry is established early in embryogenesis, with mor-
phological asymmetry only becoming apparent later. In
consequence, the ﬁeld of left-right patterning is “in

Wolbachia are intracellular inherited bacteria of arthro-
pods and nematodes, with whom they interact through
a variety of symbiotic associations, ranging from par-
asitism to mutualism. These bacteria are gaining in-
creasing interest as a biological model because of their
potential roles in evolutionary processes, insect disease
vector and agricultural pest control and human ﬁlarial
diseases. The successful applicant will use a combi-
nation of computational and wet-bench approaches to
investigate the evolution and genomic impact of Wol-
bachia transposable elements (see e.g. Cordaux 2008
Gene 409, 20-27; Cordaux et al. 2008 Mol Biol Evol
doi:10.1093/molbev/msn134).
Applicants should have a Ph.D. degree and training in
evolution, biology, bioinformatics or a related ﬁeld. The
ideal candidate will have prior research experience with
transposable elements. The initial appointment is for

POSTDOCTORAL PROPOSALS Selection of candi-
dates for a grant proposal to submit to the Portuguese
Foundation for Science and Technology
We accept applicants for a Postdoctoral grant proposal
to be submitted to the Portuguese Foundation for the
Science and Technology under the following topics:
1. “A molecular genomic approach to unravel the evo-
lution of natural toxins”. Gene families, which encode
toxins, are found in many marine animals (from deadly
poisoning jellyﬁshes to sea snakes), yet there is lim-
ited understanding of their evolution at the nucleotide
level and the evolutionary signiﬁcance of their protein
mutations. Understanding the evolution of ecological
specialization is important for making inferences about
the origins of natural toxins biodiversity.
2.ˆAGenomic diversity of proto-eukaryotes symbiosis ˆA.
Harvesting light to produce energy and oxygen (photo-
synthesis) is the signature of all land plants. This abil-
ity was co-opted from a precocious and ancient form
of life known as cyanobacteria. The most widespread
cyanobacterial symbiosis is that of plastids in eukary-
otes that happened more than 2 billion years ago. How-
ever, much more recent episodes of symbioses occurred
between cyanobacteria and eukaryotic hosts, both non-
photosynthetic (from marine sponges to ascidians) and
photosynthetic (from diatoms to the ﬂowering plants)
hosts. Characterizing the evolutionary mechanism un-
derlying such genetic cooperation is fundamental to un-72 EvolDir August 1, 2008
derstanding the origin of genomic symbiosis.
3.ˆAGlobal phylogeny and biogeography of cyanobac-
teria species ˆA. It is much debated whether microorgan-
isms are easily dispersed globally or whether they, like
many macro-organisms, have historical biogeographies.
Recent ﬁndings using faster evolving genetic markers in
protozoa species revealed considerable genetic structure
and suggested that protest biodiversity may be signiﬁ-
cantly higher than previously thought.
4. ˆAGenomic research on the chimerical origin of
Eukaryotic genomes ˆA. Eukaryotic genomes are replete
with genes of eubacterial ancestry, namely from the
Cyanobacteria, the Proteobacteria, and the Thermo-
plasmatales. These signals correspond to distinct sym-
biotic partners involved in eukaryote evolution: plas-
tids, mitochondria, and the elusive host lineage. Eval-
uating the evolutionary relationships between such an-
cient relationships is important for making inferences
about the origins and diversiﬁcation of life.
5.ˆAA genome-wide sequencing study to characterize
genes responsible for the development and adaptation
in Vertebrates ˆA. Major phenotypic changes in verte-
brates (from mammals to ﬁsh), occurred by the evolu-
tion of various gene products over the last half billion
years. Understanding the genetic basis of the diversiﬁ-
cation of development genes in vertebrates can provide
fundamental biological insight about species evolution,
ecological ﬁtness, and genetic diseases.
The granted candidates will have a monthly salary of
1495 euros and will develop their work at CIMAR,
University of Porto, Portugal ( http://www.cimar.org/-
). The candidates should have a PhD in Molecular Evo-
lution, Genomics, Population Genetics or other related
ﬁelds of research.
The candidates should include: - Detailed curriculum
vitae; - Scanned copy of the PhD degree.

gust 2008 by email to Dr Agostinho Antunes (aan-
tunes@ncifcrf.gov)

I am currently seeking a postdoctoral researcher in-
terested in working on the conservation genetics of
the endangered Hines emerald dragonﬂy (Somatochlora
hineana). Hines emerald dragonﬂy has been particu-
larly impacted by urban development in its fen habitat
in riparian areas near Chicago, IL. We are developing
microsatellite markers to elucidate the population ge-
netic structure of the dragonﬂy in disturbed areas in
Illinois and relatively undisturbed areas in Wisconsin.
We are also obtaining mtDNA sequences to be used
in analyses at larger spatial scales. Because of its en-
dangered status, we are further reﬁning nondestructive
means of obtaining samples from both adult and lar-
val dragonﬂies. The genetics portion of the study is
part of a larger eﬀort to develop methods to monitor
Hines populations and better understand its ecology.
Additional work in my lab includes investigation of the
population genetic structure of prairie dog ﬂeas (Orop-
sylla spp.) in relation to the spread of sylvatic plague
and the population genetic structure of the endangered
Uncompahgre fritillary butterﬂy (Boloria acrocnema).

The course is designed for biologists seeking advanced
training in biological sequence analysis, computational
biology core resource directors and staﬀ, and for scien-
tists in other disciplines, such as computer science, who
wish to survey current research problems in biological
sequence analysis and comparative genomics.
The primary focus of the Computational and Compar-
ative Genomics Course is the theory and practice of al-
gorithms used in computational biology, with the goal
of using current methods more eﬀectively and develop-
ing new algorithms. Cold Spring Harbor also oﬀers a
“Programming for Biology” course, which focuses more
on software development.

AdaptiveGeneticVariation Sep3-6
LAST CALL
A workshop on “Managing adaptive genetic variation in
conservation biology” will be held in La Fouly, Valais,
Switzerland, from September 3rd to September 6th
2008.
Deadline for registration is July 15th 2008.
Workshop summary: Current population management
concentrates very much on demographics, local adap-
tion, and on the maintainance of genetic variation. Re-
cent developments in theory and on some model or-
ganisms suggest, however, that there can be signiﬁcant
variation in heritable viability within a population. So-
called ’good genes’ models of sexual selection predict,
for example, that reproductive skews in the wild are
positively linked to heritable viability. Conservation
management should try to minimize any variance in re-
productive success that is not linked to viability traits.
However, including ’good genes’ eﬀects in, for example,
captive or supportive breeding could increase the aver-
age viability in the next generation. This positive ef-
fect would have to be balanced with the management of
overall genetic variation. So far, neutral markers were
mainly used to study the genetic make up of wild pop-
ulations, but new methods and analyses can now give
insights into adaptive genetic variation. We will discuss
the advancements in these ﬁelds and their possible rel-
evance for population management. Invited speakers:
Juha Meril¨ a (University of Helsinki, Finland); Wayne
Potts (University of Utah, USA); Jon Slate (University
of Sheﬃeld, UK); Jay Storz (University of Nebraska,
USA); Pierre Taberlet (CNRS & University of Greno-
ble, France). In addition to invited speakers, partic-
ipants will also have the opportunity to present their
own research. Ample time will be allowed for discus-
sions.
Registration fees are CHF 300, including local accom-
modation and food. Fees are waived for students from
the Swiss universities aﬃliated to the CUSO (Geneva,
Lausanne, Neuchatel, Fribourg and Berne), which will
be given priority.
Deadline for registration is July 15th 2008.
Please register directly on our web site: http://-www.unil.ch/dee/page11644 en.html Note that the
workshop is limited to 35 participants, and a ﬁnal se-
lection will be done at the end of July.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
