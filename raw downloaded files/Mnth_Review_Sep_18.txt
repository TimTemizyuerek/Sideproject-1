### Second announcement - abstracts due August
31st ###
Dear all,
On behalf of the Genetics Society of the UK we are
pleased to extend a very warm invitation to the 2018
autumn meeting - Genotype to Phenotype to Fitness.
The meeting will be held on 22-23 November 2018 at
Reed Hall, Exeter University, UK.
Registration and abstract submission is now OPEN
at https://my.genetics.org.uk/item.php?eventid=1014
The meeting will bring together researchers working
with diverse genetic techniques across a multitude of
systems, but who are nonetheless connected by a shared
passion for understanding adaptive evolution. The meet-
ing will have four themed open sessions over the two
days, each session featuring 2-3 of our invited speakers
together with contributed talks and posters selected
from abstracts submitted. The four themed sessions
are titled Genotype to Phenotype, Constraint and Con-
ict, Genes in Environments and Micro to Macro. We
encourage everyone to interpret these themes broadly
- they are intended to help identify common ground
for discussion, not to limit scientic scope! In addi-
tion to the open sessions there will be an Early Career
Researcher symposium oering opportunities for early
career researchers to present in an especially supportive
environment.
Conrmed Speakers: Matthew Webster (Uppsala), Nina
Wedell (Exeter), Patrik Nosil (Sheeld), Susan John-
ston (Edinburgh), Edze Westra (Exeter), Chris Jiggins
(Cambridge), Anne Charmantier (Montpellier), Miltos
Tsiantis (Max Planck, Cologne), Katrina McGuigan
(Queensland), Walter Salzburger (Basel)
Abstract deadline: 31st August 2018

State of the World's Fungi Symposium
13'14 September 2018
Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
The State of the World's Fungi Symposium coincides
with the launch of a cutting-edge new report highlight-
ing our current state of knowledge and the major issues
aecting fungal diversity and abundance. Also featured
are fungal-plant interactions, conservation and uses of
fungi, and the fungal tree of life.
The two-day symposium brings together plant and fun-
gal scientists, ecologists, conservationists and industry
and policy experts from around the world, to discuss
issues raised in the report.
The event is based around seven topical questions, with
each session comprising talks from invited experts fol-
lowed by a panel Q&A to discuss the emerging issues:
1. Conservation of fungi: what, why, where and how?
2. Does all plant life depend on fungi? 3. And have
you forgotten the lichens? 4. Do fungi provide a greater
ecosystem service or disservice? 5. Fungal networking '
who benets? 6. Panning for gold in the mould: where
do we nd commercial value in fungi? 7. Exploring the
dark taxa: when does a molecular signature become a
species?

RoyalSociety SingleCellEvolution
Dec10-11
I'm organising a 2 day meeting here at the Royal Society
on 10-11 December 2018, entitled Single cell ecology.
This will be an exciting meeting that explores the use
of single cell technologies to understand the function,
diversity and interactions of microbes. The meeting will
draw on expertise from physicists who manipulate cells,geochemists, molecular biologists, evolutionary biolo-
gists, genome biologists and microbial ecologists. The
meeting aims to discuss how dierent approaches and
datasets can be combined to make new and powerful
observations about natural microbial ecosystems. More
information including the draft programme can be found
on the meeting website here: https://royalsociety.org/-

The eld of population genetics has a remarkable
tradition of being a tight-knit and nurturing community.
In order to continue to foster that sense of community
for popgen groups in the Midwest, we are organizing
the fth annual Midwest PopGen conference. The
meeting will begin Friday at noon and continue to
Saturday evening with a BBQ on Friday evening, and
an opportunity to check out the state fair on Saturday
night!

Additional notes 'V The meeting overlaps with the
state fair. This should be very fun (and was part
of the reason that we chose this date) but adds a
degree of diculty to meeting logistics. Look for a
place to stay soon (we are soliciting twin cities folks
interested to put people up), and plan on taking public
transport. 'V The meeting follows a symposium on
machine learning on august 23rd (in the same location)
with speakers including Casey Greene, Katie Polard,
and Dan Schrider. Come early for the fun! We also
have one open speaker slot for that meeting so contact
Yaniv if you would like to present at that meeting. We
hope to pair people up with a place to stay, so locals
should let us know how many people they can host, and
out-of-towners should let us know if they are looking
for a place.

Evolutionary biology is a vibrant eld with a theoreticalframework that itself evolves. The Evolution Evolving
conference will focus on some emerging themes in the
relationship between development and evolution. Top-
ics include the evolutionary causes and consequences of
developmental bias, plasticity, niche construction and
extra-genetic inheritance - all of which contribute to
an understanding of evolvability. The conference will
feature a balanced program of talks and poster sessions
spanning three days, and be a mix of empirical and
theoretical work, as well as contributions to the history
and philosophy of evolutionary biology.
Invited speakers <https://evolutionevolving.org/-

We are seeking applications from highly-motivated can-
didates for a PhD at the Australian National Univer-
sity's Division of Evolution and Ecology, in the Research
School of Biology, supervised by Prof. Loeske Kruuk,
Prof. Andrew Cockburn and Dr Kara Youngentob.
Project: Testing environmental causes of population
decline in an Australian song-bird. Many wild animal
populations have recently declined in numbers, but de-
termining the exact causes of these declines and the
mechanisms by which environmental change aects in-
dividual tness is dicult. The aim of this project is
to test the extent to which ne-scale biotic and abiotic
environmental variation can explain a decline in a pop-
ulation of a common, cooperatively-breeding wild bird
in south-east Australia. Our detailed long-term study
of superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) has revealed a
dramatic ~50% decline in population size over the past
three decades. The project will combine the extensive
life-history data on the bird population with long-term
remote sensing data, terrestrial laser-sensing measures
(LiDAR) and ground surveys to assess the contribution
of spatial and temporal variation in vegetation struc-
ture to population dynamics. It will aim to test the
interactive eects of a changing climate and ecological
conditions on bird population life-history, including a
marked decline in the extent of cooperative breeding.
There is also the potential to use new high-density ge-
nomic data to assess changes in spatial genetic structureover time, or to extend the project in other directions
particularly suited to the interests of the student.
Eligibility: Applicants should have an Honours degree
or MSc in a related discipline, relevant research expe-
rience, strong interests in animal ecology or evolution,
and good quantitative skills. The project will involve a
combination of analysis of long-term superb fairy-wren
and remote-sensing data with eldwork at the study site
of the Australian National Botanic Gardens. Experience
of remote sensing data and GIS techniques would be a
strong advantage but is not a prerequisite.
Funding: Scholarships are available from the Australian
National University at a rate of $27,082 per annum tax-
free for up to 3.5 years. The project would start in early
2019.
Applications: If interested, please rst contact
Loeske.kruuk@anu.edu.au directly. Please send a sin-
gle pdf le which includes your CV (including your
nationality), a brief outline of your past research ex-
perience and reasons for applying for this studentship
(max. 600 words), and contact details of two academic
referees. Candidates will need to apply to the ANU's
Research School of Biology programme for PhD stipend
and scholarship.
Deadlines for full applications to ANU (see links below)
are 31 August 2018 for international students and 31
Oct 2018 for Australian students.

A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is why
anisogamy, the dierence in gamete size that denes
the sexes, has repeatedly led to large dierences in be-
haviours such as mate searching, mating competition,
and parental care. Recent theory has made progress
in this area based on mathematical models of the feed-

the current state of a population (including current sex
dierences). The objective of the project is to develop
mathematical and simulation models to study this topic
further.
The successful candidate should hold an MSc degree in
a relevant area (e.g. behavioural ecology, evolutionary
biology, economics with focus on game theory, physics,
mathematics, computer science), with some mathemat-
ical and computing skills and a keen interest in evolu-
tionary biology.
Funding is provided by the Department of Biological
and Environmental Science to ll positions in four out

Landscape genetics and adaption in a marsupial pest
Project Description New Zealand is recognised as a
biodiversity hotspot but many native plants, animalsand ecosystems are threatened by introduced mammal
species including a marsupial from Australia. The same
species has also been identied as a carrier of bovine tu-
berculosis impacting on agriculture. Brush tail possums
(Trichosurus vulpecula) reached high density through-
out New Zealand after being introduced in the 19th
century to establish a fur trade. A nationwide manage-
ment programme includes widespread use of a synthetic
toxin (uoroacetate) called 1080. This chemical is natu-
rally produced by some plants within the natural range
of some brush tail possum populations in Australia,
resulting in regional toxin resistance.
We are oering a 3 year PhD scholarship based at Massey
University, New Zealand, that will inform on the evo-
lutionary genetics and molecular ecology of brush tail
possums. The project will examine the genetic basis of
uoroacetate resistance and adaptive responses of pest
possums in New Zealand, as part of a wider programme
exploring landscape genetics, ecology and disease trans-
mission in this species.
The research will likely involve : Application of Next
Generation Sequencing tools, bioinformatics and ecolog-
ical modelling, population genetic analysis, phylogenet-
ics, GIS, screening for Bovine TB and other microbial
diseases. You will explore the evolutionary ecology of
pesticide resistance within the context of an exceptional,
unintended, nationwide experiment.
Candidates who are able to demonstrate enthusiasm for
biological science and creativity in problem solving will
be at an advantage. The ideal applicant will have a
GPA of 7.0 (A-) or higher, a four-year bachelor degree
with honours or a Master ^A^As degree in an evolution,
zoology, genetics, ecology or a related eld.
The scholarship (including tuition fees) is available from
early 2019 (start date negotiable). Review of appli-
cations will begin immediately and continue until the
position is lled.

jointly seeking to ll a
*** PhD Position (salary level TV-L E13, 65%) *** to
study evolutionary genomics in invasive ants, specically
rapid adaptive change in Cardiocondyla obscurior
The xed-term position is available for three years and
will begin on 1 November 2018 or as soon as possible.
The available PhD position is integrated into the re-
cently funded DFG Priority Programme (Schwerpunkt-
programm) \Rapid Evolutionary Adaptation: Potential
and Constraints" (SPP1819). This research program
brings together research groups from dierent back-
grounds in biology to advance our understanding of the
mechanisms and the evolutionary signicance of rapid
adaptive changes.
The ecological success of ants is a prime example for
the role of innovation in adaptation and evolution. In-
triguingly, ants and other social Hymenoptera have the
highest rates of recombination and genomic rearrange-
ments in all animals studied so far. This PhD project
aims to explore the evolutionary signicance of theseprocesses in ants. The project is focused on the inva-
sive ant Cardiocondyla obscurior, and the successful
candidate will study the genome evolutionary and popu-
lation genetic mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation
to novel habitats in this species.
Cardiocondyla obscurior has successfully established
populations across the tropics despite expected low ge-
netic diversity in incipient populations. The goal of
the PhD project is to understand to what extent non-
homologous recombination and transposable elements
contribute to genetic diversication by generating struc-
tural variants - the largest source of inter-individual
genetic variation, which can have substantial pheno-
typic consequences.
To this end, the successful candidate will collect ant
colonies in the eld, maintain live colonies in the lab,
conduct behavioral and wet lab experiments, and, most
prominently, generate and analyze population genomic
data. Thus, this PhD thesis involves eld work, wet lab
work, and computational work, with a strong empha-
sis on the generation and analysis of high-throughput
sequencing data.
The successful candidate will be supervised by Lukas
Schrader (University of M unster) and Jan Oettler (Uni-
versity of Regensburg) and will thus work in collabora-
tion with other members of the research group in the
Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity at the Univer-
sity M unster (wwu.de/evolution/molevolsocbio) and in
the Institute for Evolution at the University Regens-
burg (janoettler.wordpress.com). Both groups have a
long history of research collaboration, focusing on the
study of evolution of social insects. Regular visits be-
tween both groups and meetings within the scope of the
DFG Priority Program will provide the framework for
a successful PhD project.
The PhD student will join in the M unster Graduate
School of Evolution (MGSE, wwu.de/evolution/mgse/),
one of the largest graduate programs in evolutionary
biology in Germany. The student will also be expected
to spend extended periods at the research group in
Regensburg to conduct part of the research.
Requirements Applicants are required to have an out-
standing master's degree or equivalent degree in biology
or a related eld. Applicants must also show a strong
interest in evolutionary and computational biology and
show motivation to be trained in the analysis of high-
throughput genomic data. Other requirements are the
capacity to formulate and solve research problems and
eectively interpret research results, as well as motiva-
tion to conduct research at both research groups - at the
University of M unster and at the University of Regens-
burg. Finally, uency in written and spoken English is20 EvolDir September 1, 2018
required.

EvolutionAnimalCommunication
Masters position - Evolution of animal communication
The Beckers' Lab at Murray State University is looking
for a Masters student who is interested in the evolution
of animal communication starting in the spring semester
of 2019.
We study katydids and crickets to address questions
pertaining the evolution of animal behavior, or more
specically, animal communication. Our research fo-
cusses on the eects of the environment (i.e., phenotypic
plasticity) on mating songs and song preferences. In
our main study species, Neoconocephalus triops, day
length induces two substantially dierent mating songs.
These dierences in the songs are comparable to species
dierences within the genus. In a collaboration with
two other labs (Missouri and West Virginia), we study
the genetic underpinnings of this behavioral plasticity
and how the involved genes possibly relate to speciation
within the genus.
In addition, we are currently exploring the eect and
evolutionary consequences of the seasonal environmenton the communication system of a local cricket species,
Gryllus rubens. In this species, the songs change in
response to its rearing temperature. This cricket and N.
triopsare two of the very few described Orthopterans
that display this kind of phenotypic plasticity in their
reproductive communication systems. Studying this
environmentally-induced variation provides important
insights in the evolutionary potential of plasticity.
I seek driven, enthusiastic, and focused students to join
my lab at Murray State University. Successful appli-
cants have a B.S. in biology, ecology, or related discipline
and are interested in studying animal behavior and evo-
lution. If you are interested in this opportunity and/or
have any questions, please email Dr. Beckers at obeck-
ers@murraystate.edu. For your application, make sure
to address in an attached document (1) your research in-
terests, (2) how they relate to the Beckers' lab research,
and your (3) GPA.
Funding for tuition and a summer stipend are avail-
able for research related to N. triopssong plasticity. In
addition, MSU oers a TAship ( $8,000/year) and a bio-
diversity stipend ( $10,000 per year + research supplies
and meeting expenses) that the applicant is encouraged
to apply. Please get in touch with me if you have any
questions. Once you indicated interest in the position,
an interview will be set up shortly after (i.e., skype).

MitonuclearEvolution
Available at Portland State University, Portland, Ore-
gon: We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusias-
tic MS or PhD student to work on a National Science
Foundation-funded project that uses experimental ge-
nomics in C. elegans nematodes to study mitonuclear
evolution and the impact of sexual system on mitonu-
clear adaptation.
Planned start date: September 2019. Earlier, o-cycle
admission will be considered.
Project Description: Energy metabolism in nearly all
eukaryotic life forms relies on coordinated interactions
among gene products encoded by both mitochondrial
and nuclear genomes, and thus depends upon inter-
genomic coevolution. Neither the processes maintaining
this coevolution nor its downstream evolutionary conse-
quences are well understood. These consequences were
recently hypothesized to include the evolution and main-
tenance of sexual reproduction. This project leverages
the expertise and resources of three research groups
to provide the direct, non-retrospective tests of major
hypotheses to explain mitonuclear genome coevolution.
These hypotheses predict that integration of the two
genomes is achieved primarily by xation of nuclear
mutations that compensate for the deleterious eects
of previously acquired mitochondrial mutations, and
that this process will favor sexual recombination among
nuclear chromosomes. We will apply experimental ge-
nomics with Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to study
evolutionary process within the context of the mito-
chondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the proper
functioning of which relies on the maintenance of favor-
able mitonuclear epistatic interactions. The project will
take full advantage of the powerful C. elegans system
to: 1) Determine the impact of sexual system on the
tempo and patterns of mitonuclear adaptation. C. ele-
gans strains containing deleterious mitochondrial- and
nuclear-encoded ETC mutations will undergo labora-
tory adaptation in replicate populations experiencing
obligate selng, facultative outcrossing, or obligate out-
crossing. This design also permits examination of how22 EvolDir September 1, 2018

StockholmU ButteryEvolution
The Lab of Christopher Wheat is seeing a PhD stu-
dent in the project ' The evolution of female limited
alternative life history strategies'.
Alternative life history strategies (ALHS) exist across
diverse species, wherein dierent strategies of resource
investment couples with the tradeos that result in di-
vergent phenotypes with dierential consequences in
Darwinian tness. While male-limited ALHS are well
known and their study has signicantly advanced our un-
derstanding of the selection dynamics acting in the wild,
comparatively few examples of female-limited ALHS
are known, either due to biological rarity or our lack of
understanding of how ALHS manifest in females. Thus
there is a need for mechanistic insights, as none exist for
female ALHS. In this project, the student will continue
investigations into the genetic basis a female-limited
ALHS in the buttery Colias, working to understand
the mechanisms giving rise to tradeos in investment to
reproduction vs. pigment synthesis.
In this project we will combine several approaches: (i)
genome wide association studies across diverse species
to nd the genetic switch for the ALHS, (ii) multiple-
level \omic" investigation of key functional physiological
layers and (iii) direct manipulations of the ALHS switch,
using CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockouts, (iv) eld and lab
based studies to determine the abiotic and biotic factors
maintaining the variation in the wild. By integrating
these data we will build models of how the ALHS has
evolved and is maintained across species. The project
therefore oers the PhD-candidate a chance to learn a
variety of modern methods in organismal biology and
can be tailored in several directions according to the
skills, aptitude and interests of the PhD-candidate.September 1, 2018 EvolDir 23

ButteryGeneDuplications
The Lab of Christopher Wheat is seeing a PhD student
in the project 'Investigating the role of gene duplications
in coevolutionary interactions'.
Coevolutionary interactions are thought to have spurred
the evolution of key innovations and driven the diversi-
cation of much of life on Earth. However, the genetic
and evolutionary basis of the innovations that facili-
tate such interactions remains poorly understood. We
have recently found that while gradual changes in trait
complexity appear to have been facilitated by allelic
turnover, key innovations are associated with gene du-
plication events. Here we will focus upon investigating
the tempo and mode of such duplication events in associ-
ation with coevolutionary interactions between Pieridaebutteries and their Brassicales hostplants. In this
project, the student will continue investigations into
the role of gene duplications in several buttery species,
working to understand the mechanisms giving rise to
the ability to detoxify hostplant secondary chemicals.
In this project we will combine several approaches: (i)
comparative genomic studies across butteries to iden-
tify genes undergoing duplication dynamics associated
with changes in hostplant usage, (ii) multiple-level \omic"
investigation of physiological performance (iii) direct
manipulations of the identied detoxication genes us-
ing CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockouts. These projects will
be performed in collaboration with Prof. Lars Arves-
tad at the Department of Mathematics, who is also
hiring a PhD student to develop and use novel methods
for detecting gene duplications in comparative genomic
analyses. The goal is to have both PhD students work
together and share insights between their two elds.
The project therefore oers the PhD-candidate a chance
to learn a variety of modern methods in organismal and
genome biology and can be tailored in several directions
according to the skills, aptitude and interests of the
PhD-candidate.

UCentralFlorida PlantEvolution
PhD positions in Plant Evolutionary Ecophysiology, Ge-
nomics, and Biochemistry
{
The Mason and Goolsby labs in the Department of
Biology at the University of Central Florida are cur-
rently recruiting motivated, curious, and enthusiastic
PhD students to start in Fall 2019. Our labs work
closely together and research a wide variety of topics
in plant physiology, ecology, evolution, genetics, and
biochemistry.
The Goolsby Lab is a plant evolutionary genomics and
biochemistry lab. We are interested in exploring the evo-
lution of complex traits using a combination of empirical
and theoretical systems. I am interested in recruiting
graduate students for Fall 2019 who are interested in
any of the following areas:
(1) the evolution of heavy metal hyperaccumulation in
plants, especially wild sunowers (Helianthus), which
naturally accumulate extremely high levels of normally
toxic metals (nickel, cadmium, zinc, etc). Metal accu-
mulation and tolerance are both complex traits that
can be represented by dose-response curves known as
function-valued traits. I am particularly interested in
the evolutionary history and genomics of metal hyper-
accumulation and tolerance as independent function-
valued traits.
(2) C4 and CAM are two photosynthetic pathways that
confer elevated resistance to heat and drought stress,
respectively. Both pathways have evolved from C3 an-
cestors independently several times in the evolutionary
history of plants. These pathways involve multiple com-
plex biochemical and anatomical adaptations that are
generally thought to be incompatible with one another.
However, the Portulaca lineage consists of plants which
are capable of performing both C4 and CAM photosyn-
thesis within the same leaf. Our research in Portulaca
is concerned with mapping the evolutionary history
of distinct anatomical and biochemical changes associ-
ated with these two pathways within the genus, as well
as uncovering the genetic mechanisms responsible for
maintaining two functional co-occurring photosynthetic
pathways.
(3) the development and improvement of phylogenetic
comparative methods and algorithms for studying thesecomplex traits. In particular, we are interested in de-
veloping methods for studying the evolution of environ-
mental and developmental plasticity, high-dimensional
complex traits, multivariate datasets with missing data
and multiple within-species observations, and compara-
tive methods for mixing continuous and discrete traits.
The Mason Lab is a plant evolutionary ecophysiology
lab. We are especially interested in the physiological
and genetic mechanisms underlying plant adaptation
to diverse environmental pressures, including abiotic
factors like climate and soil fertility, and biotic factors
like herbivory and disease. All plants face physiological
trade-os between growth, defense, and reproduction,
and we seek to understand the coordinated evolution of
the traits that govern these three core functions. Our
research addresses a variety of questions across multiple
scales, from macroevolution to population dierentia-
tion to within-individual plasticity, as well as in multiple
systems, from crops to wild herbs and woody plants. In
particular, for students interested in joining the lab for
Fall 2019, I am especially interested in recruiting stu-
dents who are interested in any of the following topics
(listed in no particular order):
(1) core plant ecophysiology, especially the evolution of
gas exchange physiology and water/nutrient relations,
especially in the context of function-valued trait evo-
lution and adaptation to diverse environments. Wild
sunower (Helianthus) would be a highly suitable system
for this, but I am open to other systems as well.
(2) the evolution, ecology, genetic architecture, and ap-
plied utility of mycorrhizal symbiosis, especially in crop
and wild sunowers (Helianthus) given ongoing work in
the lab, but open to expanding into other systems as
well.
(3) the physiological and metabolomic impacts of poly-
ploidy in sunowers (Helianthus) and the broader Aster-
aceae using both comparative and manipulative ap-
proaches.
(4) the genetic architecture of chemical defense inducibil-
ity under attack from insects and fungal pathogens. This
would be highly suitable to wild and crop sunower (He-
lianthus), but I'm open to expanding into other systems
as well.
(5) the role of oral morphological and chemical varia-
tion in determining pollinator visitation and/or pest and
pathogen resistance, in both crop and wild sunowers
(Helianthus).
(6) the evolution of leaf chemical defenses in relation to
the leaf economics spectrum in temperate woody trees
and shrubs.26 EvolDir September 1, 2018
(7) plant phytochemistry, broadly dened. I nd vari-
ation in plant secondary metabolism fascinating and
would be interested in questions in a wide variety of
systems and.
Interested students should contact either Chase Mason
or Eric Goolsby (or both) to discuss research interests
before applying to the Department of Biology graduate
program

Intraspecic variability is the basic ingredient for bio-
logical evolution. Although it is expected that it will
impact how species react to global change, few experi-
mental tests have been done. This is the objective of the
DIVERCE project, a collaboration between two Belgian
Universities: Does Intraspecic Variability modulate
the impact of EnviRonmental Change on biodiversity
and Ecosystem function?
In this framework, we oer a full-time 4-year PhD posi-

(UCL, Belgium), Earth and Life Institute, Biodiversity
Research Centre, in the Quantitative Conservation Bi-
ology team led by Prof. Nicolas Schtickzelle, starting
01/10/2018.
The PhD candidate will combine microcosm experi-
ments with (statistical and mechanistic) modelling to
examine if and how the level of intraspecic variability
modulates the eects of global change (temperature and
pollution) on population and community dynamics, and
coexistence in competitive protist (freshwater ciliates)
communities.
Two other PhD students will perform experiments with
the exact same design on phytoplankton and on arbuscu-

MSc IN EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY AND GENET-
ICS OF ICELANDIC ARCTIC CHARR
Location: University of Guelph and H?lar University
College, Iceland. Field work occurs in the lava caves
around Lake Myvatn northern Iceland.
Advisors: Dr. Moira Ferguson, University of Guelph,
Guelph, ON Canada and Dr. Camille Leblanc, H?lar
University College, Iceland.
Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes con-
tribute to the generation of biodiversity, and the com-
plexity of their interactions has presented a challenge to
our understanding of nature. Our knowledge of the roles
of development, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene
ow in shaping biodiversity is complicated by the spatial
and temporal variability inherent in natural systems. A
powerful approach to better understand such processes
involves monitoring wild populations over generations
and obtaining data including pedigrees, phenotype, and
tness, so that we can directly infer evolutionary param-
eters, particularly those describing selection and genetic
variation. We are seeking a talented MSc student to
apply such an approach to wild populations of Icelandic
Arctic charr, in order to further our understanding of
the complex interplay among genes, phenotypes, and
ecology, in natural environments.The successful MSc student will test important mi-
croevolutionary theories with individual-based pheno-
typic records, molecular genetic (SNP) data, and ecolog-
ical data from 19 populations of Arctic charr residing
in a spatially replicated system of lava caves in the My-
vatn area of northern Iceland. The monitoring of these
populations began in 2012 and provides an impressive
long-term dataset for novel insights. Advanced analyti-
cal techniques will be used to understand spatial and
temporal patterns of genetic variation, natural selection,
and ecological covariates. The student will be based at
the University of Guelph with Prof. Moira Ferguson
but will spend time at H?lar University College with Dr.
Camille Leblanc (including annual eldwork). Our ideal
candidate will have interests in evolution, ecology, and
genetics, and will have strong quantitative skills - neces-
sary for the advanced analytical techniques used in this
eld. The student will be able to work independently
and as part of a larger team, both in the laboratory and
in the eld.
The project is part of a long term collaboration be-
tween the University of Guelph, Canada (Prof. Moira
Ferguson), H?lar University College (Prof. Bjarni K.
Kristj?nsson, Prof. Sk?li Sk?lason and Dr. Camille
Leblanc), the University of Iceland (Prof. Sigur?ur
S. Snorrason, and Prof. Arni Einarsson), EAWAG,
Switzerland (Dr. Katja R?s?nen), and the University
of St Andrews (Dr. Michael Morrissey). The project is
funded by The Icelandic Science Foundation ? Rann?s
and NSERC (Canada). The position will be lled as
soon as a good candidate is found (target date 1. May
2018). The funding for the graduate student positions is
sucient to cover living costs and University of Guelph
tuition fees for Canadian citizens or permanent resi-
dents.
Applicants should send an application letter with a

of Berkeley in California, Fernando Racimo Centre for
GeoGenetics Copenhagen University and Tim Sackton
Director of Bioinformatics at Harvard University.
The student will be based at University of Iceland and
work under the supervision of Einar Arnason, Katrin
Halld orsd ottir, and Bjarki Eldon in Berlin. This is a
highly interdisciplinary project combining latest molec-
ular technology, and advanced statistical and bioinfor-
matic analysis. We will maintain good communication
between all participants. The position therefore comes
with possibilities to visit participating labs and groups in
Berlin, Berkeley, Copenhagen, Oxford, and Cambridge
(MA).
Analysis of time-series of samples using whole-genome
sequencing promises to be a powerful way of understand-
ing evolutionary history, in particular, for detecting se-
lection. The PhD project is about the time-series partof the overall project.
We are looking for a highly motivated individual with a
strong interest in evolutionary and population genomics.

InsectComputationalEvolBiol
The Department of Ecology and Evolution of the Univer-
sity of Lausanne invites applications for the position of
a doctoral student in insect computational evolutionary
biology and genomics.
The incredible diversity of insects makes them fascinat-
ing to study, with important applications in the charac-
terisation of animal biology, the control of disease vectors
and pests, and the conservation of threatened insects.
Falling sequencing costs are improving genomic species
sampling and enriching sources of functional data, chal-
lenging researchers to nd innovative approaches to best
exploit these data to bring new levels of depth and detail
to our understanding of biology. Overcoming these chal-
lenges requires substantial methodological advances in
data integration and interrogation, supported by robust
computational infrastructures. With an initial focus
on disease-vector mosquitoes, this Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation funded research project aims to exploit
genomic evolutionary signatures to enhance the under-
standing of putative functions of thousands of currently
uncharacterised genes from hundreds of organisms.
The successful candidate will be based at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution of the University of
Lausanne ( https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home.html),
under the supervision of Prof. Robert Waterhouse(www.rmwaterhouse.org), also a Group Leader at
the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (https://-
www.sib.swiss/waterhouse-robert). The aims of the doc-
toral thesis will include the design and development of
cross-species comparisons to quantify patterns of evolu-
tionary change with a focus on characterising constraint
and selection. Understanding of and condence with
genomics analyses, evolutionary concepts, and statistics
will help with the design and implementation of com-
putational biology approaches to delineate conservation
patterns and link them to biological functions, and are
therefore desirable.
Deadline: 31.08.18 Further information: https://-

PhD POSITION : EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY/BIO-
INFORMATICS
The position : The Breton lab (University of Montreal)
is looking for an ambitious and highly motivated PhD
student interested in understanding the genetic and epi-
genetic mechanisms of sex determination in the marine
mussel Mytilus edulis.
PROJECT : The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is the most
important cultured mollusc and therefore a major eco-
nomic driver in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Fisheries
and Oceans Canada), and one of the most important in
the world. Once successful in southern North Carolina,
M. edulis has undergone a worrying decline in recent
years in the Atlantic Provinces and the United States.
Dierent hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
reasons for this decline: overexploitation, ocean acid-
ication, pollution, diseases, increased predators and
global warming. Notably, global warming has been used
as a hypothesis in several other studies to explain the
decline of blue mussel populations, a result that could
be attributable, among other things, to a drastic change
in the sex ratio (i.e. the ratio of males and females),
which could jeopardize the viability of certain popula-
tions. Indeed, marine mussels and oysters are known to
have a sex ratio regulated by the environment (temper-
ature and/or food). However, unlike oysters, very few
studies have focused on sex determination mechanisms
in marine mussels. A major reason for studying sexual
determinism in mussels relates to their economic and
nutritional importance. It is widely accepted that the
success of livestock operations is largely related to the
characteristics of the breeding populations (natural or
captive), and in particular the need to control sex ratios,
reproduction periods, fecundity and fertility.
This FRQNT-funded project aims to better understand
the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of sex deter-
mination in Mytilus edulis. Therefore, the successful
applicant should have experience or a strong interest
in bioinformatics, evolutionary biology and molecular
biology.
Funding (17K/yr) is available to support the successful
candidate for three years in addition to a limited travel
budget. Expected start date is May 2019 or September
2019. The Universite de Montreal is a French language
institution where graduate work may be undertaken inSeptember 1, 2018 EvolDir 31
English or French.
Interested students should contact
s.breton@umontreal.ca and attach a CV, academic
transcript, contact details of two academic referees, and
a brief description of their research interests.
The position will remain open until a suitable candidate
is found.
Please note that only those selected for an interview
(Skype or telephone) will be contacted. Preference will
be given to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.

PhD Position in Musculo-skeletal modelling in lizards,
University of the Sunshine Coast, Australia.
The Clemente Lab at the University of the Sunshine
Coast, Australia is seeking outstanding applicants for
funded PhD scholarships.
Our research focuses on the relationship between form,
function and ecology of living and extinct animals. One
fundamental goal in evolutionary biology is to under-
stand how size can constrain the evolution of morpho-
logical traits and limit the ability to exploit ecological
niches. Size inuences all
biological functions from cellular respiration, up to how
fast an animals can run or climb. Yet to completely
understand the inuence of size on performance, we re-
quire information on the integration of multiple systems,
including the nervous, muscular and skeletal systems.The PhD project will contribute to research that in-
vestigates the neuromuscular and biomechanical mecha-
nisms associated with changes in body size using varanid
lizards as a model. We have collected an extensive mor-
phological dataset for this group including the muscle
architecture of varanid lizards ranging from the smallest
(7.6 g Varanus brevicauda) to the largest extant species
(40 kg Varanus komodoensis), as well as their maximum
speeds. We will use musculoskeletal models of varanid
lizards in OpenSim to predict higher level biological pa-
rameters (e.g. running speed) in both living and extinct
species. We will be able to scale our model up or down,
exploring size, or change its shape (e.g. limb length).
This will allow us to understand what the limitations to
size are, in biological systems, and at what size certain
structures no longer work. This research will have direct
implications for understanding evolution as a process of
optimisation.
Essential qualities for candidates include:
- strong computational and analytical skills in biome-
chanics
- experience using biomechanical assessment tools (e.g.
high speed video, force plates)
Preferred qualities for candidates include:
- interpersonal skills to work eectively with patients,
research subjects, team members, and project collabo-
rators. - excellent critical thinking skills, ability to work
independently
- research experience and practical knowledge of research
principles is required whether through previous intern-
ship, work experience, or coursework.
- interest or previous experience in musculo-skeletal mod-
elling, e.g. SIMM/ OpenSim.
- interest in evolutionary theory

In the recently funded project \The interplay between
animal personality and sexual selection" we will inves-
tigate how personality dierences are reected in be-
haviours such as male-male competition and space use,
mate choice, and parental care; and how these dier-
ences ultimately aect an individual' ^As survival and
reproductive performance. The project will focus on the
model species Allobates femoralis, a Neotropical poison34 EvolDir September 1, 2018
frog with a prolonged breeding season, pronounced male
territoriality, and male parental care. The study will
be carried out in an experimental island population in
French Guiana. Complimentary experiments can be
carried out in the laboratory frog population at the
University of Vienna. One unique feature of this project
is our ability to monitor, assay, and track an entire
animal population in its natural habitat in an island
setup over several generations. By identifying respective
costs and benets of specic personality proles, the
proposed project will help us to better understand how
behavioural variation can persist over evolutionary time.
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student,
who will be responsible for conducting the eld exper-
iments (typically from end of January to end of April
each year), molecular analyses (parentage, relatedness),
and/or hormonal and bioacoustics analyses. Particular
focus of the PhD thesis will be negotiated depending on
the candidate' ^As specic interests and/or skills. How-
ever, priority will be given to applicants with previous
experience working in tropical environments, frogs, ani-
mal personality, molecular analyses, hormonal analyses,
and/or bioacoustics.
Our lab welcomes applications from outstanding stu-
dents with a passion for research and eld work. The
candidate must be willing and capable to spend up to
3-4 months each year in a tropical research station under
relatively simple living conditions (sleeping in hammock,
restricted privacy, simple sanitary facilities). Fieldwork
can get physically challenging and the river island can
only be reached via a zipline or paddling boat.

Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate
University (http://www.oist.jp/) is seeking qualied ap-
plicants for two technician positions. The lab works at
the interface of ecology, evolution, and natural history,
with an empirical focus on ant biodiversity. We use
a variety of approaches to understanding biodiversity
including eld expeditions, collections-based research,
x-ray micro-CT, 3D modeling and morphometrics, phy-
logenomics, biodiversity informatics, and quantitative
theory. Although two positions are described below, we
are exible with regards to division of duties among the

downstream applications such as segmentation, 3D mod-
eling (e.g. https://sketchfab.com/arilab), morphomet-
rics, 3D printing, and interacting with biodiversity data
in virtual and augmented reality.
Qualications: An undergraduate degree or higher in
a scientic or technical eld and experience with sci-
entic research are required. Although there is no re-
quirement for prociency in a specic computational
program/language, it is important that the person hasstrong computational skills and a high ability to learn
dierent software and methods independently. Although
not required by any means, experience with any of the
following would be highly desirable: biodiversity collec-
tions management, 3D modeling, 3D animation, data

formatic data analysis pipelines, application support for
utilizing HPC resources, and desktop support to lab
members. In addition, there are opportunities to lead
or participate in development of new technologiesthat
facilitate and accelerate biodiversity research.
Qualications: An undergraduate degree or higher in
a scientic or technical eld and experience with scien-
tic research computing are required. As this position
is not tied to a single application or task, the ideal
candidate would have a good baseline of programming
skills, including familiarity with both compiled and in-
terpreted languages, and ability to learn independently.
Prociency with Linux, SQL-based database design and
administration, and at least basic familiarity with server
administration are required. Experiences with one or
more of the following would be highly desirable but
are not required; GIS, bioinformatics, phylogenetics,
ecoinformatics, parallel computing, and statistical com-
puting.
Job Data: OIST is a newly established international
graduate university located in the resort area of Onna-
son, Okinawa, Japan, and oers a high quality of life

Summary: This collection of essays examines selected
works in the American literary tradition from an evolu-

work to pose new questions about long admired, much
discussed texts, the collection as a whole provides an
introduction to Darwinian literary critical methodology.
Individual essays feature a variety of gures Benjamin
Franklin to Billy Collins targeting tness-related issues
ranging from sexual strategies and parental investment
to cheating and deception. Attention is paid to the phys-September 1, 2018 EvolDir 73
ical and social environments in which ctional characters
are placed, including the inuence of cultural-historical
conditions on resource acquisition, status-building, com-

unexpected insight into long familiar works.

FlySpecies Interactions
Hi everyone,
We are writing because we are hoping for help nding
data. Specically, we are interested in investigating
species interactions and natural selection across broad
geographical areas in the gall forming y Eurosta sol-
idaginis. Many colleges and universities throughout the
eastern United States and Canada have used this sys-
tem in undergraduate laboratory courses to illustrate
directional and stabilizing natural selection.
We suspect there are a lot of unpublished data that can
be compiled to gain a better understanding of how the
strength and direction of selection varies across broad
geographic areas. Please write if you have access to and
are willing to share one of the following types of data:
1. The average strength of species interactions (propor-
tion of galls attack by each enemy: Eurytoma gigantea,
Eurytoma obtusiventris, Mordellistena sp., downy wood-
peckers, chickadees) and variance standardized selection
gradients/dierentials acting on Eurosta gall size (di-
ameter), including their standard errors if possible. We
would also need a location of the collection (coordinates
or an approximate area), and a rough time (month and
year) that the collection was taken. 2. If possible, we
prefer raw data. This would mean having a dataset thatincludes the size (diameter) and fate (attacked by enemy
X or Y or survived) of each gall, from which selection
coecients can be calculated. Again, we would also
like to know the time and place that the collection oc-
curred. Any additional data on environmental correlates
(population sizes & densities, climatic data, landscape
features, etc.) would be an appreciated bonus.

VOLUNTEER RESEARCH ASSISTANT: FLIGHT BE-
HAVIOR AND EVOLUTION OF GYPSY MOTHS
Two short-term volunteer research assistant opportu-
nities (September 5-25, 2018) are available under the
direction of Dr. Ilga Porth (Laval University), represent-
ing the chance to work with regulated invasive gypsy
moths (Lymantria dispar spp.) in a USDA quarantine
facility in Connecticut (USA)*. The assistants will live
in a dormitory at the quarantine facility, and will per-
form moth maintenance and collection of female ight
behavior data under laboratory conditions. Following
data collection, they will have the option to participate
in subsequent data analyses geared towards gypsy moth
behavior, morphometrics, population genetics, or evo-
lution. Travel to the quarantine facility (from Canada
or USA), living expenses, and a daily stipend will be
provided.
To apply, please email Gwylim Blackburn
(gwylim.blackburn@gmail.com) with a brief mes-
sage outlining your interest in the project and an
attached CV that lists 2 references. Review of
applications will occur as they arrive. The successful
candidate for this position will require a passport valid
for travel in the USA. *PROJECT DETAILS:Gypsy moths (Lymantria) are a group of plant defolia-
tors adapted to a wide variety of deciduous and conif-
erous hosts. During population outbreaks, gypsy moth
larvae can cause widespread forest damage. Adult fe-
male ight capacity represents a key dispersal limitation
and therefore a crucial trait determining our ability to
monitor and regulate the spread of gypsy moth popula-
tions. Currently, a single introduced species featuring
limited female ight capacity (L. dispar dispar) is es-
tablished throughout eastern USA and Canada. The
persistent arrival of female-ight-capable gypsy moth
species on ships and cargo at North American trading
ports represents an important invasion threat, in terms
of their potential for successful establishment or hy-
bridization with local moths. The present research aims
to develop genetic markers capable of identifying the
species, origin, and female ight capacity of gypsy moths,
and to explore the genetic architecture and evolution of
ight in this group.

Dear Community,
We are pleased to announce the release of a new soft-

Accuracy in Sweep Detection). RAiSD implements a
novel computational method for identifying multiple
signatures of selective sweeps using single nucleotide
polymorphism vectors. This approach leads to higher
sensitivity and accuracy, as well as considerably reduced
complexity than current methods.
An article (Open Access) describing and evaluating the
method and the software can be found here: https://-

interested in characterizing the phenotypical dierences
between breeding and non-breeding individuals and to
develop an integrated understanding of the causes and
consequences of contrasts in reproductive output.
Applicants should be available for a period of 6 to 12
months starting as soon as possible. They should be
hardworking, enthusiastic, physically t, and prepared
for long hours in the laboratory. Successful applicants
will be responsible to run experiments and will be in-
volved in data collection (behavioural observations, col-
lection of blood and urine samples). Other general tasks
related to animal handling and husbandry and data
handling will also be expected. Some specic volunteer
positions will require the successful applicants to be com-
fortable with being involved in experiments requiring
the sacrice of experimental subjects. Working weeks

Volunteers needed for the period October 2018 to May
2019
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Applicants must have
an interest in working in the eld and with animals.
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6
AM), and stops its activity with dusk (7 PM). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40 ^AoC during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for
long periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part
of a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance of
the research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1650 (around 110 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy theirown food in Springbok. Including extras (going out for
dinner; shopping), you should expect costs of about 450
Euros or 600 US $per month.
German students can apply for a grant from
the Deutsche Akademischer Auslandsdienst (DAAD,
www.daad.de ). Here, commonly travel grants of 300
Euro are given to students. Students from other coun-
tries are encouraged to seek funding from their home
institutions / home country. Students get an invitation
letter which they can use to apply for funding in their
home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers
to start in October 2018 as well as beginning of 2019.
Volunteers are expected to stay for a minimum of 2-3
months, though longer periods are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

Dear colleagues, We are editing a special issue for the
journal Genes (impact factor: 3.19) entitled \Tools for
Population and Evolutionary Genetics".
In recent years, the development of next generation
sequencing techniques has fueled an explosion in the
pace at which genomic data sets are generated, while
dramatically decreasing the costs of genome sequencing.
Comparison of these datasets can uncover remarkable
information about the evolution of organisms. The avail-
ability of datasets of ever-increasing size and complexity
has resulted in a growing need for computational tools
that allow their eective and ecient analysis.
This special issue focuses on tools for population and
evolutionary genetics, including, but not limited to,
bioinformatics approaches, and computational tools, al-
gorithms and resources. We welcome submissions of
reviews, research articles, and short communications.
We also encourage the submission of manuscripts de-
scribing new tools, in the form of \concept papers".
Deadline for manuscript submissions: 31 July 2019.

AarhusU StatisticalGenetics
Hi all, I'm advertising for a 2-year postdoc to work
on developing and applying methods for analysis of
genome-wide association study data. Applications by
5th October. A summary below, or for more details see
this link
http://www.au.dk/en/about/vacant-positions/-
scientic-positions/stillinger/Vacancy/show/1001254/-
5283/ |{
Aarhus University is recruiting a 2-year postdoc in sta-
tistical genetics based at the Bioinformatics Research
Centre (BiRC). The provisional starting date is 1st
November 2018.
The postdoc will be jointly supervised by Drs
Doug Speed, Manuel Matthiesen and Sren Dinesen
~Astergaard. There are two broad aims, however the spe-
cic projects will be decided according to the interests
and experience of the successful applicant.
1 - Application of recently developed methods to genome-
wide association study (GWAS) data. Dr Speed has
created the software package LDAK which contains a
variety of methods for analysing GWAS data. These in-
clude the prediction tool MultiBLUP. A possible projectof the postdoc will be applying MultiBLUP to GWAS
data for a large number of traits (e.g., from dbGAP,
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium or UK
Biobank), to compare its performance to that of rival
methods such as polygenic risk scores and LDPred, then
investigate ways MultiBLUP can be improved.
2 - Development of new methods for analysing GWAS
data. Central to LDAK is a method for estimating the
SNP heritability of a trait, the proportion of pheno-
typic variation explained by all SNPs. To date, SNP
heritability has been estimated only for common SNPs
(MAF>0.01), but it is currently unknown how best to
estimate the contribution of rare SNPs. Therefore, a
potential project is investigating how best to estimate
the rare SNP heritability of a trait. First the post-
doc will test methods using simulated data, then apply
the most successful to GWAS data for traits such as
schizophrenia, alzheimer's disease and heart failure.
*Requirements* A PhD degree and strong expertise in
statistical genetics is essential. The position will involve
analysis of large-scale genetic datasets, so the ideal can-
didate would be familiar with popular genetic software
(e.g, PLINK) and at least one coding languages (e.g.
R).
*Supervisors* Assistant Professor Doug Speed special-
izes in developing statistical methods for analyzing large
scale GWAS data. He has released the software LDAK
(www.ldak.org) which contains tools for detecting causal
variants, constructing prediction models and better un-
derstanding genetic architecture, using both individual-
level data and summary statistics.
Professor Matthiesen specializes in the analysis of large
scale GWAS data and its clinical interpretation. He is
a physician by training with a specialization in med-
ical genetics, and has a strong background in genetic
epidemiology, biostatistics and molecular genetics.
Professor Sren Dinesen ~Astergaard is a medical doctor
who focuses on psychiatric research. He is particularly
interested in translational psychiatry, and the idea that
studies should cover the full pathway from discovery in
the lab, bench to bedside, bedside to clinical applica-
tions, and from clinical applications to healthcare and
global health.
*Place of work and associated departments* The po-
sition will be primarily based at the Bioinformatics
Research Centre, a department with approximately 50
members focused on the development of statistical mod-
els and computational algorithmns to analyse genetic
data (www.birc.au.dk). The position will also be linked
to the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative
Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH), a consortium in charge84 EvolDir September 1, 2018
of 50,000 cases for autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipo-
lar disorder and depression (www.ipsych.au.dk) and to
the Department of Clinical Medicine, Denmark's largest
health science institute (www.clin.au.dk/en).
The place of work is C.F. Mllers All e 8, 8000 Aarhus,
and the area of employment is Aarhus University with
related departments.

tion procedure, please contact doug@aias.au.dk.

Guo Lab: Fish Evolution and Genomics Group Guo
(BC) Lab has research interests in both comparative
and population genomics to understand how genetic
variation contributes to sh diversication and adapta-
tion. There are two major research topics in my lab.
1) Gene duplication and consequence in sh genome.
With this topic, we will analyze publicly available sh
genome data to characterize how duplicated genes evolve
in sh genome (Guo et al., 2011, 2012; Guo 2017), and
eventually to understand their role during the successful
radiation of teleosts. 2) Local adaptation in marine
sh. Local adaptation is usually dicult to detect in
marine shes with large population size, e.g., due to
weak population structure, low genetic dierentiation,
etc. Our earlier studies show that local adaptation
could be inferred by using population genomics with
integrating environmental associated analysis (Guo, et
al., 2015; 2016a; 2016b). As such, we will use popu-
lation genomics approach by utilizing next generation
sequencing (NGS) data to identify the genetic signature
of adaptation in wild marine sh, e.g., hairtails, salmons,
sticklebacks, etc. For more information about our lab
and/or interest in the PIFI program, please write to

Post-Doctoral Associate Position Open in Aquadro lab
at Cornell
A successful candidate will help design and carry out
research aimed at testing evolutionary and functional
hypotheses to explain the episodic positive selection on
the Germline Stem Cell regulatory gene bag of mar-
bles (bam) in dierent species of the fruit y genus
Drosophila. An ability to integrate population genetic
and functional genomic approaches is key. Work will
focus on experimental studies including CRISPR/Cas9
genome editing and the analysis of fertility, cytologi-
cal and gene expression for edited variants in multiple
species of Drosophila. Good 'hands' in the lab are crit-
ical as is attention to detail and accuracy. The main
responsibilities include conducting research, attendinglab meetings and journal clubs, and preparing research
results for publication and presentations at scientic
meetings. Opportunities may also exist for mentoring
graduate and undergraduate students.
Minimum/Basic Qualications (required by start date):
- PhD or equivalent degree in genetics, developmental
biology, population genetics functional genomics, or a
related eld. - Demonstrated record of research pro-
ductivity and publications. - Strong molecular biology
skills
Preferred Qualications: - Research experience with
Drosophila genetics and/or developmental biology. - Ex-
perience with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing or a strong
desire to learn. - Knowledge of or willingness to earn
at least basic population genetics theory. - Experience
with uorescent microscopy - Experience with genomic
data analysis. - Programming/scripting experience or a
willingness to learn (e.g. Python/ Perl, R)
Our lab's current research is on the population genetics
and functional evolution of genes that regulate germ line
stem cells in Drosophila. Our focus is the evolutionary
and functional analysis of bag of marbles (bam), the key
regulatory 'switch' gene for germ line stem cell renewal
or dierentiation in Drosophila. Our work involves the
use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to functionally test
hypotheses of protein function and evolutionary drivers
of strong positive natural selection we discovered acting
on bag of marbles in multiple species and lineages of
Drosophila. Central to our studies are tests of functional
and evolutionary interactions of the intracellular bacte-
ria Wolbachia and germ line stem cell genes, particularly
bag of marbles, across the genus Drosophila. We are also
carrying out computational analyses of the evolutionary
history of Wolbachia infections in Drosophila species.

CornellU AdaptationGenomics
Postdoctoral opportunity to study the genomic basis of
adaptation with gene ow
The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cor-
nell University is looking for a highly motivated postdoc
to work on an NSF-funded project aimed at elucidat-
ing the genomic underpinnings of adaptive divergence
despite extensive gene ow in the Atlantic silverside
(Menidia menidia). The Atlantic silverside is a small
estuarine sh that exhibits a remarkable degree of local
adaptation in growth rates and a suite of other traitstightly associated with a climatic gradient across lati-
tudes. Decades of prior lab and eld studies have made
the Atlantic silverside one of the marine species for which
we have the best understanding of evolutionary tradeos
among traits and drivers of selection causing adaptive
divergence. Yet, the underlying genomic basis is so
far completely unknown. Our ongoing work integrates
whole genome sequencing of wild sh sampled across the
distribution range with breeding and phenotyping in the
lab to 1) examine ne-scale spatial patterns of genomic
dierentiation along the adaptive cline and 2) map key
locally adapted traits to the genome to dissect their
underlying genomic basis. The postdoc will have access
to a newly generated reference genome along with link-
age and QTL maps and already generated low-coverage
whole genome sequence data for >1,000 individuals.
Varying levels of gene ow across the species range cre-
ate a natural experiment for testing general predictions
about the genomic mechanisms that enable adaptive
divergence in the face of gene ow, and key goals of
the project include integrating patterns of variation in
the wild with ndings from the trait mapping to 1)
examine how genomic architectures underlying local
adaptation vary across connectivity regimes and 2) shed
light the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements
and other tight linkage among adaptive alleles in facili-
tating adaptation. We are also building up time series
of samples from multiple locations to examine disper-
sal - selection dynamics over seasonal time scales for
real-time inference of how selection against migrants
and their ospring maintains local adaptation despite
homogenizing connectivity. Specic focus areas for the
postdoc will depend on their interests, and there will
also be opportunities for developing new lines of inquiry.
Additional opportunities arise from a prior dataset we
have on the genomic basis for rapid sheries-induced
evolution in this species.
Qualications: Candidates should have completed or be
within 1-3 months of completing a PhD in evolution-
ary genomics, molecular ecology, bioinformatics or a
related eld. We are looking for a creative and talented
scientist who is a team play with a good publication
record and excellent organizational and communication
skills. The successful candidate must have a strong
computational/bioinformatics background and previous
experience with analyzing large population genomics
data sets. Experience working in the Unix environment
is essential and familiarity with one or several program-
ming languages is highly desirable.|
Interested candidates should send their CV, a descrip-
tion of their motivation and research interests and con-

HebrewUJerusalem BeeEvolution
Postdoctoral position at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. Regulation of body size-based social or-
ganization in bumblebees
Social bees provide an excellent system for studying
the evolution of sociality. Diversity in body size un-
derlies two of the organization principles of bumblebee
societies: worker division of labor and caste determina-
tion, but little is known on the proximate mechanisms
regulating body size and how they are socially regu-
lated. This project explores how social cues such as
pheromones, behavior, and queen regurgitates, inter-
act with endocrine and epigenetic processes to regulate
genes involved in larva development in the bumblebee
Bombus terrestris. To meet these goals we integrate
sociobiological, behavioral, physiological, and molecu-
lar approaches. The molecular methods include but
are not limited to RNAseq and RNAi. The position
will be located at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
with opportunities to travel to the US for training and
research.Required qualications
- A PhD degree pending or obtained within the last
three years in molecular biology, genetics, entomology,
developmental biology, neurobiology, or related elds.
- Relevant lab expertise in developmental biology, neu-
roanatomy, bioinformatics, or molecular biology tech-
niques. Experience with RNAseq, bioinformatics, RNAi,
or CRISPR-Cas9 DNA editing, or with bees is advanta-
geous.
- An outstanding academic record
- Experience in organismal biology (e.g., animal behavior,
neuroethology, or ecology) is advantageous.
- Fluent spoken and written English
- Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, abil-
ity to work in a team.
The position is for 2-3 years but appointment is ini-
tially for one year and renewable based on performance.
Salaries are commensurate with experience and based
on standard postdoc fellowships in Israeli universities.
We oer a strong, internationally recognized and inter-
disciplinary working environment with an open academic
atmosphere. Location in the beautiful city of Jerusalem.
The project is part of a collaboration with the Woodard
and Yamanaka Labs in the Department of Entomol-
ogy at the University of California, Riverside and is
supported by the US-Israel Agricultural Research and
Development Fund, and the US-Israel Binational Sci-
ence Foundation. The position will start on 1 September
2018 or as soon as possible thereafter. To apply, please
send a cover letter, current CV, and names and contact
information for three

Postdoc: Modeling Gene Drive and Evolution of Insec-
ticide Resistance in Mosquitoes
OVERVIEW: We recently received funding from NIH for
a project titled \Combining Aedes aegypti genomics and
modeling to improve gene drive strategies and our un-
derstanding of insecticide resistance evolution". Aedes
aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, Zika, chikun-
gunya, and urban yellow-fever. This project will fund
two postdocs; one who will do the genomics and bioin-
formatics (individual already identied), and a second
to work on the modeling aspects (this position).
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Although the idea of us-
ing selsh genetic elements to drive specic transgenes
into populations was proposed over 40 years ago, it is
only recently with the advent of CRISPR-based geneediting technology that this approach has gained broad
attention from researchers and the news media.
The most straightforward approaches for building gene
drives using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are theoreti-
cally expected to result in spread of the gene drive to
individuals in all populations that are connected by
even minimal gene ow. These approaches are appro-
priate in some cases, but detailed mathematical models
are needed to understand the dynamics of spread and
the potential for resistance evolving to the gene drive
mechanisms. More complex approaches have been pro-
posed for developing gene drives that are spatial and/or
temporally limited. More novel molecular approaches
accompanied by modeling are needed for development
of these limited gene drives.
We have funding from the NIH to build mathematical
models aimed at assisting the design and deployment of
gene drives for suppressing or altering the characteristics
of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue virus that
impacts over 100 million people a year. Ae. aegypti has
substantial ne scale population structure but detailed
parameter estimates are lacking. Other work within
the project is focused on accurately estimating these
parameters through genomic approaches.
We currently have a detailed model that simulates the
population dynamics and population genetics of Ae. ae-
gypti in a city on the Amazon river, Iquitos, for which
there are rich data sets on both mosquito dynamics and
dengue epidemiology. The rst main goal of our NIH
grant will be to incorporate the parameter values from
the genomic analysis into the detailed model, and to use
the model for assessing the expected performance of a
variety of gene drive mechanisms in Iquitos and similar
cities.
Insecticides have been used to suppress Ae. aegypti in
Iquitos since 2001. The mosquitoes have responded by
evolving resistance. We are fortunate to have samples
of Ae. aegypti from the year 2001 to the present and
have already begun molecular analysis of signatures of
selection. The second main goal of our NIH grant is
to use the detailed mathematical model to evaluate hy-
potheses about the spatial and temporal dynamics of
insecticide resistance evolution that involves multiple
genes. This work will break new ground in eorts to
control the evolution of insecticide resistance and will
also be informative about the spread of resistance to
gene drives.
JOB DESCRIPTION: The postdoc in this position will
lead modeling eorts to achieve both of the project goals.
In addition to working with our detailed model, the post-
doc will have the option of developing more general mod-
els to evaluate novel approaches to spatially/temporally104 EvolDir September 1, 2018
limited gene drives and examine impacts of specic gene
drives on dengue virus epidemiology. Our project is
strengthened by collaborations with a number of labs
in the US and in Peru. The postdoc will interact with
members of these other research groups. There will
be an opportunity for some work in Peru. The ini-
tial appointment is for two-years with the potential for
extension beyond that period.
QUALIFICATIONS: We are looking for a postdoc with
a solid background in population biology and popula-
tion genetics who has experience with modeling and
who wants to do applied research. Experience with
C++ or related languages is desirable. Ability to work
independently and as a member of a team is essential.

ArthropodHybridization
Postdoc in Arthropod Introgressive Hybridization and
Phylogenomics, San Diego State University
Overview - An NSF funded research postdoctoral posi-
tion is available in the laboratory of Dr. Marshal Hedin
(https://marshalhedinlab.com/) to conduct population
and phylogenomic studies of introgressive hybridization
in a species-rich clade of jumping spiders. This position
is potentially funded for three years, with an oppor-
tunity to spend Y3 in the lab of Dr. Wayne Maddi-
son at the University of British Columbia ( https:/-
/waynemaddisonlab.wordpress.com/). The postdoc-
toral associate will also be expected to interact closely
with the collaborative team of behavioral biologists
at UC Berkeley, in the Damian Elias lab ( https://-
nature.berkeley.edu/eliaslab/).Position Description 'V This research seeks to under-
stand how introgressive hybridization (IH) has impacted
phylogeny (deep and shallow) and character evolution
in Habronattus jumping spiders, and how IH itself re-
ects<>aects mating system evolution. Habronat-
tus represents a diverse and intriguing system where
prezygotic isolation via female mate choice appears to
be a primary isolating mechanism, facilitated by high
visual acuity and complex, multimodal courtship orna-
ments and behaviors. However, instead of paradigmatic
\strong sexual selection acting to isolate", female prefer-
ences in Habronattus appear \open" to greater or lesser
degrees across species and over time (ancient to contem-
porary). A consequence is the sharing of both genes and
phenotypes across divergent populations and species
boundaries. In driving the evolution of additional ge-
netic and phenotypic novelty, this IH potentially fuels a
creative feedback loop involving mate choice evolution,
phenotypic evolution, and species diversication.
A postdoctoral associate working in the Hedin lab will
lead genus-wide phylogenomic studies, conduct popula-
tion genomics experiments, and potentially work with
Maddison (Y3 @ UBC) on character evolution and hemi-
plasy analyses. Applications will be accepted until the
position is lled; review will begin on September 21,
2018.
Qualications - Minimum qualications include a Ph.D.
in Evolutionary Biology, Entomology, Computer Sci-
ences, or a related eld, with demonstrated experience
in eldwork, collection of next generation sequence data
(e.g., RNASeq, sequence capture, RADSeq, genomics)
and associated bioinformatics, and interest in hybridiza-
tion. Ability to mentor, communicate clearly, work
independently, and interact collaboratively is essential.

within freshwater mussels (Family: Unionidae) across
multiple dimensions of biodiversity within streams in
the Mobile and Tennessee River Basins. This project
will address basic ecological principles related to niche
vs neutral based models across levels of biodiversity in
both freshwater mussels and their associated gut mi-
crobial community. This is a highly interdisciplinary
project to understand ecological and evolutionary as-
sociations among the environment, genetic diversity,
functional traits, and community assembly across both
host and microbiome phylogenies. In addition to being
housed within the Atkinson lab, the selected applicant
will work closely with Je Lozier at the University of
Alabama and will collaborate with researchers at the
University of Mississippi. More information about the
project can be found at http://mussels.ua.edu/ . The
position is for a highly motivated postdoctoral research
associate whose primary objective will be to oversee
eldwork and conducting functional trait analyses, but
will also be involved in integrating phylogenetic, genetic,
and functional trait data. Responsibilities will include
leading eldwork, setting up a eld experiment, labo-
ratory work, statistical analysis, and interfacing with a
postdoc based at University of Mississippi. The ideal
candidate should have experience conducting eldwork
in streams in dicult conditions, a background in basic
ecological principles including ecological stoichiometry,
familiar with conducting basic water chemistry analy-
ses, excellent computational skills, SCUBA certied (or

DiseaseEvolution
Description: From infectious disease ecology, we know
that the magnitude of vertical (from parent to ospring)
vs. horizontal (among unrelated individuals) transmis-
sion can predict pathogen virulence (the harm caused
to the host) and the strength of selection for host resis-
tance or tolerance against pathogens. Despite this, there
has been little focus on how transmission of microbiota
occurs, is maintained, and impacts upon (co)evolution.
This is especially true in the plant literature, despite
decades of evidence for a role of plant- associated mi-
crobiota in shaping plant health. An idea that has been
gaining traction in recent years is that interrupted verti-
cal transmission (for example through C-section delivery
and antibiotic use in infancy) can lead to irreversible
change and/or loss of human microbiome diversity over
time. We are seeking to extend this concept to the plant
microbiome, where common agricultural practices such
as seed treatment, tillage, crop rotation, and chemical
antimicrobials almost certainly result in disrupted mi-
crobiome transmission and could therefore have similar
short and long-term impacts on the host-microbiome
association.We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to lead an NSF-
funded project exploring the importance of microbiome
transmission mode in shaping adaptation and commu-
nity assembly. The work will take place in the labora-
tory of Dr. Britt Koskella, at UC Berkeley, and will be
in collaboration with Profs Steven Lindow (UC Berke-
ley, Plant and Microbial Biology) and Jessica Metcalf
(Princeton). The project will include a combination of
experimental evolution and bacterial/fungal community
proling/' ^Aomics' ^A approaches, using tomato plants as
a model system.
Responsibilities: Responsibilities include microbiologi-
cal culturing, plant inoculations, extraction and analysis
of both amplicon and metagenomic data sets, statistical
analyses, and preparation of manuscripts for publica-
tion. There also exists ample opportunity to design and
implement additional projects of mutual interest.
Minimum/Basic Qualications Required (At the time
of application): Candidates must have completed all
degree requirements except the dissertation or be en-
rolled in an accredited Ph.D. or equivalent international
degree program
Additional Required Qualications (By start date):
Ph.D. or equivalent international degree with a track
record of publication in peer-reviewed journals.
Preferred Qualications (By start date): Preference
will be given to applicants with experience in bioinfor-
matics, microbial ecology, molecular biology, statistics,
and/or disease ecology, as well as excellent writing and
communication skills.
Appointment: This position reports to Dr. Britt
Koskella. The initial appointment will be at 100% time
for one year with the possibility of extension for up to 3
years based on satisfactory performance. The approxi-
mate start date of this position will be September 2018,

about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomic
datasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.Minimum/Basic Qualications required at the time of
application: - Completion of all doctoral degree re-
quirements except the dissertation in genetics, compu-
tational biology, biostatistics, population genetics or
related elds.
Additional Qualications (required by start date): -
PhD or equivalent degree in genetics, computational
biology, biostatistics, population genetics or a related
eld.
- Knowledge of statistics and population genetics theory.
- Demonstrated record of research productivity and pub-
lications.
- Programming experience (e.g. C/C++, Python/ Perl,
R or other programming languages) Preferred Qual-
ications: Experience with large-scale genomic data
analysis.

Dear evol dir community,
We are looking for an enthusiastic post-doctoral re-
searcher to join a multi-disciplinary project on exper-
imental evolution. The ideal candidate would have
experience in bacterial genetics and experimental evolu-
tion. The position will last for two years and will start
between March and June 2019. Here is the summary of
the project:
Although the last decades witnessed many victories
against *infectious diseases*, the spread of multidrug-
resistant bacteria is now challenging these past successes.
Species that were previously well controlled are now
becoming health threats. For instance, /Escherichia/
/coli/, which caused minor trouble 15 years ago, is now
a major concern in the hospital owing to increased an-
tibiotic resistance and extra-intestinal virulence. This
pattern is partly driven by the worldwide expansion of
clone ST131. It was undetected in the collections sam-
pled in humans in the 1980s but represents now about
7% and up to 18% of strains isolated in commensal con-
ditions in France and in extra-intestinal pathologies in
the UK, respectively.The fast emergence and evolution-
ary success of multi-resistant clones with some ecological
specicity in the /E. coli/ species raises both medical
and fundamental interests. How can a clone or phy-
logroup propagate and conserve its specicity despite
the presence of genetic exchanges that may transmit its
genes to other species members. Experimental evolution
suggests that adaptation selects rapidly for mutations
scattered on the chromosome that interact epistatically
with one another. We suggest that this form of Genome
Wide Epistasis (GWE) may explain the diversication
within /E. coli/ species. GWE may limit genetic trans-
fers from and to a given clone as disruption or partial
transfer of a successful combination of alleles will be
costly and result in recombinants with low tness. To
test our hypothesis, we will use two unique, unprece-
dented and complementary strain collections that both
evolved over the last 30 years. The Long-Term Experi-
mental Evolution (LTEE) from Richard Lenski with now
70,000 generations of asexual evolution in a perfectly
controlled laboratory environment is a unique analytical
material to unravel the genomic consequences of adap-
tation. The emergence, 30 years ago, of two antibiotic
resistant clades of ST131 provides an alternative well-122 EvolDir September 1, 2018
documented system of evolution that occurred this time
in the wild, in the presence of genetic exchange. More-
over, ST131 is a public health concern owing to ST131
high virulence and antibiotic resistance. To uncover the
emergence and extant of GWE, we will perform crosses
between strains and study the tness of the recombi-
nants. Recent developments in synthetic biology tools
and sequencing technologies allow now the production at
high rates of recombinants and the precise measurement
of their tness in bulk through barcoding sequencing.
We therefore propose to evaluate precisely the distribu-
tion of tness eects of recombinants in the two previous
systems.Their comparison and integration in a theoreti-
cal model of speciation will provide an unprecedented
quantitative approach to GWE in a bacterial species.
To validate this phenomenological approach, we will
uncover the molecular determinants of GWE using new
developments in milliuidics and microuidics. With
a method akin to quantitative trait loci analysis, our
aim will be to detect regions that are restrictive to
genetic exchange and to precisely measure the tness
of recombinants involving the transfer of these regions.
For a subset of identied combinations of mutations,
we will use a combinatorial approach coupled to mi-
crouidic genotyping to reconstruct the precise adaptive
landscapes composed of mutations or regions selected
in dierent populations/clades. This ambitious project
tackles the fundamental question of the emergence of
stable genetic specicities in a sexual bacterial species
of medical relevance, and addresses it using recent tech-
nological revolutions in the elds of synthetic biology,
sequencing, milliuidics and microuidics.
The TIMC-Imag is a very diverse biomedical institution,

EcoEvolutionaryDynamics
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic
postdoc to work on eco-evolutionary dynamics in a coe-
volving host-virus system.
Deadline: September 30th, 2018 Inquiries and applica-
tion: lutz.becks@uni-konstanz.de
Project Description: There is a continuing interest to
characterize the pace of adaptive evolution and a need
for a better understanding of the factors inuencing
the rate of evolution. Especially, we lack a detailed
understanding on how evolutionary dynamics at the
genomic level relate to the distribution of tness in pop-
ulations evolving together in complex environments. In
this project, we aim to identify rapid adaptive genomic
changes in coevolving host-virus populations and to de-
termine how multiple stressors for the host and virus
alter the rate and trajectory of rapid adaptation. In
previous experiments combined with genomic analyses
we showed how demographic changes of host and co-
evolution between the host and virus aected adaptive
changes at the genome level of both, host and virus. We
now aim testing the hypothesis that abiotic stressors
and species interactions interactively aect the pace
of adaptive evolution. Overall, we aim to identify if
and how environmental complexity introduced by abi-
otic stressors constrains the pace of resistance evolution
even when the mutation rate is high.
This project is in close collaboration with col-
leagues from Eawag (Dr. Philine Feulner; https:/-
/www.eawag.ch/en/aboutus/portrait/organisation/-
sta/prole/philine-feulner/show/) and is part of
the DFG funded priority program Rapid Adaption
(https://dfg-spp1819.uni-hohenheim.de/).
Highly motivated candidates holding a PhD degree in
evolutionary biology or ecology are welcome to apply.
Applicants should have a background in evolutionary
theory or population dynamics and ideally experience in
working with plankton or microbial systems and show
an enthusiasm for basic research. Experience in ow-
cytometry and advanced imaging analyses are welcome.
The successful candidate should be able to communi-cate eectively with individuals from a wide range of
disciplines.

January 1, 2019, for 2 years CLOSING DATE FOR AP-
PLICATIONS: October 15, 2018, or until position is
lled RANK: Post-doctoral fellow
SALARY RANGE: $45,000- $55,000 per annum (plus
benets), commensurate with qualications and experi-
ence
PROJECT OVERVIEW: We are using a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) in combination with linked-
read whole-genome resequencing in 30 males and 30
females to test for and identify the genetic basis sex
determination in sea lamprey. Sex determination mech-
anisms in shes are highly variable, ranging from geno-
typic (GSD) to environmental (ESD) sex determination.
Male-biased sex ratios under conditions of high popula-
tion density or slow growth have led to suggestions of
ESD in lampreys, but there is no conclusive evidence in
lampreys of ESD, and no sh species with exclusively
ESD are known. Understanding the genetic basis of sex
determination in lampreys is important given their phy-
logenetic position as one of only two surviving groupsof jawless vertebrates. Furthermore, the sea lamprey
is a signicant pest in the Laurentian Great Lakes and
genetic manipulation of sex determination could be a
powerful tool for control. The Principal Investigators
on the project are Drs. Marg aret Docker and Colin
Garroway (Department of Biological Sciences, Univer-
sity of Manitoba) and Dr. Alison Wright (Department
of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheeld).
JOB DESCRIPTION: The primary task of this position
will be to test for a genetic basis for sex determination
in the sea lamprey. However, the PDF will also have
the opportunity to develop and pursue his or her own
research questions within the context of sea lamprey
evolutionary genomics.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
* To undertake research on the genomics of sex deter-
mination in sea lamprey. To contribute signicantly to
experimental design, data interpretation and statistical
analysis. * To trial new techniques and assay systems
as required and keep abreast of the research literature
relevant to the project. * Disseminate research through
publications in peer reviewed journals. * To attend and
contribute to research seminars, departmental meetings
and international conferences. * Carry out administra-
tive roles as required, e.g. organising physical or remote
meetings with collaborators, arranging travel to consor-
tium meetings. * Perform professional activities such as
refereeing papers, editing journals, refereeing research
grants, external examining, organising conferences, com-
mittee membership and involvement with professional
bodies on accreditation.
QUALIFICATIONS:
* PhD in evolutionary biology, computational biology,
or genetics or successful PhD viva at commencement of
contract. * Proven ability to process and analyse next-
generation sequencing data. Experience with Chromium
10X technology is desired but not essential. * Prociency
with analysis software and programming languages, as
well as ability to write or adapt scripts and pipelines for
in silico genetic analysis. * Ability to work both collabo-
ratively and independently * Well-developed leadership,
management and inuencing skills

hrp2 deletion
A postdoc position is available at the Department of
Biological Sciences and Eck Institute for Global Health
at the University of Notre Dame, USA, in the lab of Cris-
tian Koepi (https://biology.nd.edu/ people/cristian-
koepi/ , https://globalhealth.nd.edu). A PhD/T.A.
position within the same project is also available.
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are an indispensable tool
for clinical malaria diagnosis and community surveys.
The most sensitive class of RDTs for P. falciparum re-
lies on the detection of the Histidine Rich Protein 2
(HRP2). Recent reports of parasites lacking hrp2 have
alerted clinicians and endanger elimination eorts. The
evolutionary forces resulting in hrp2 deletion, and the
impact of malaria control activities, are not understood.
Molecular monitoring of parasite populations is required
to understand this process and to select the optimal use
of diagnostic tools for diagnosis.
We will use a novel, highly sensitive and high through-
put method to diagnose hrp2 deletions in parasite iso-
lates from dierent countries and time-points, and apply
genome-wide analysis to understand the emergence and
spread of hrp2 deletion.
Requirements: We are looking for an enthusiastic candi-
date with a Ph.D. in microbiology, evolution, population
genetics, or a related eld. Knowledge of common lab-
oratory methods, e.g. DNA/RNA extraction, PCR,
etc, good organizational skills and an interest to inter-
act with researchers in malaria endemic countries are
essential.
The postdoc position is initially available for one year,
with the potential for extension.

Post-Doctoral Position University of Pennsylvania -
Perelman School of Medicine The Voight lab invites
applications for a computational Post-Doctoral position
at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,
within the Department of Systems Pharmacology and
Translational Therapeutics and the Department of Ge-
netics. The lab focuses on translating discoveries from
human genetics data into insights about the biological
basis and genetic architecture of human disease and
understanding selection during recent human evolution.
Objectives: The candidate will have the opportunity
to work with large collections of human genetic data
sets, focused around population genetics problems, i.e.,
inference of mutation rates and signatures of selection in
the genome. In particular, projects will be built around
(i) machine learning methods to models for mutation
rate across the human genome, integrating large-scale
functional annotations of the genome, (ii) applying de-
veloped, cutting-edge models for mutation rate at high
resolution to infer natural selection in the genome and
apply them to existing and newly-generated human ge-
nomic data sets, and/or (iii) develop novel methods that
utilize these models and insights generated therein in a
disease association context.
The applicant will focus their eorts on the method-
ological development in these areas. However, this will
also include large-scale analysis and applications to hu-
man genomics data numbering in the tens of thousands,
sequenced across the entire genome. The applicant
also will work to develop approaches that translate
any insights into actionable information in clinical and
bench-lab experimental settings.
Qualications: 1. The candidate will have a MD, PhD,
or equivalent doctorate, with a strong background in one
or more of the following areas: statistics, biostatistics,
population genetics, human genetics, genetic epidemiol-
ogy, computational biology and/or genomics, bioinfor-
matics.
2. The ideal candidate will have a track record of scien-
tic productivity and leadership.
3. The ideal candidate will demonstrate a working pro-
ciency in programming, scripting, and statistical com-
puting (i.e., C/C++, Python, PERL, R, etc.), will have
experience handling large data sets in the UNIX/LINUXoperating environment, experience in high-performance
cluster computing.
Application Instructions: To apply, please send (i) a
cover letter that includes the names and contacts for
three references and a short statement of research in-
terests, and (ii) a current CV to: Benjamin Voight,

UppsalaU SpeciationGenomics
*Post-doc in Speciation Genomics*
A two-year post-doc is available in the Karrenberg group
at the Department of Ecology and Genetics, Evolu-
tionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden.
Processes that govern speciation and divergence are of
vital importance for most other areas of biology. Yet,
our understanding of organismal and genomic processes
generating such divergence is still limited. Progress is
expected from research that incorporates both experi-
mental work and modeling. This post-doc provides an
excellent opportunity to engage in such an integrated
approach starting with extensive, preexisting ecological
and genomic data.
The main project for this post-doc aims at 1) identifying
genomic regions associated with extrinsic and intrinsic
reproductive barriers (i.e. adaptive divergence and seg-
regation distortion) and 2) understanding their role in
the divergence process with respect to demographic his-
tory. We study the hybridizing sister species Silene
latifolia and S. dioica (campions) from the carnation
family. These two species have separate sexes and evolu-
tionarily young sex chromosomes. Various reproductive
barriers have been characterized, including dierential
habitat adaptation (Favre et al. 2017, New Phytolo-
gist). In this system, reproductive barriers appear to
have a complex but coupled genetic architecture with
an important contribution of the sex chromosomes (Liu
& Karrenberg, 2018, Molecular Ecology). Silene is a
non-model system with developing genomic resources
such as a partial genome sequence (Papadopulos et al.,
2015, PNAS), high-density linkage maps (Liu & Karren-
berg, 2018, Molecular Ecology) and transcriptomes (e.g.,
Zemp et al., 2016, Nature Plants). For this post-doc
project, extensive ddRADseq data is already available,
such that data analysis can start directly. Available
data are from a transplant experiment with recombi-
nant hybrids (Favre et al. 2017, New Phytologist), from
recent crossing experiments and from range-wide sam-
pling of the two species. The post-doc is very welcome132 EvolDir September 1, 2018
to develop follow-up experiments or analyses depend-
ing on his/her interests and/or to join further ongoing
projects and collaborations.
*Qualications* The successful candidate has a Ph.D.
degree in evolutionary biology, genetics or in a related
eld and a genuine interest in speciation. Experience in
the following areas is needed: bioinformatics, population
genomics, general statistics with R and R programming.
We are looking for a dedicated, creative and productive
scientist and expect the post-doc to engage in close
teamwork, as well as in independent work.
*The environment* The Evolutionary Biology Centre
(EBC) hosts one of the largest aggregations of evolu-
tionary biologists in the world and Uppsala University
was recently ranked 7th in the world in evolutionary
biology (CWUR 2017). The Department of Ecology
and Genetics is a highly international working environ-
ment and our research spans from evolutionary ecology
and genetics to studies of ecosystems. A number of
high-prole projects address natural and sexual selec-
tion, local adaptation, speciation, molecular evolution,
microbial diversity, and ecosystem processes. Uppsala
University is the oldest university in Scandinavia and
the city of Uppsala is a vibrant college town with beau-
tiful surroundings conveniently situated 40 minutes by
train from Stockholm.
*Position* The postdoc is funded by a tax-free 2-year
scholarship from the Carl Tryggers Foundation, amount-
ing to 23,000 SEK per month. It is a requirement from
the funding agency that you are an incoming postdoc
(in other words, that your Ph.D. is not from Uppsala
University).
The starting date is as soon as possible, but at the latest
in November/December 2018.
*How to apply* Please contact Sophie Karrenberg (so-
phie.karrenberg@ebc.uu.se) if you would like to apply
or have questions about the position. Applications will
be reviewed as they come in.
Applications should be submitted via e-mail to so-
phie.karrenberg@ebc.uu.se with the following documents
combined into one pdf le: 1) A cover letter describing
your research interests and suitability for the position
2) A detailed CV with a list of publications and other
scientic merits and description of your experience and
education in bioinformatics, population genomics and
R programming
3) Contact details of two to three references, who are
available via telephone or e-mail
Prospective candidates will be invited for interviews
in person or via Skype in late August/early September2018; I will also be happy to meet prospective candidates
at the Evolution congress in Montpellier.

JOB DESCRIPTION Postdoc in evolutionary and func-

fellow for up to three years to work at the intersection
of functional genomics and evolutionary developmental
biology. The postdoc will work as part of a collabora-
tive eort to determine what kind of genomic changes
drive color pattern diversity in butteries. The success-
ful candidate will join the Riccardo Papa lab and be
hired through the University of Puerto Rico, but will
be physically based in the Robert Reed Lab at Cor-
nell University. The postdoc will join a large group of
researchers and directly interact with an international
collaborative team that includes the Arnaud Martin Lab
at George Washington University, the Owen McMillan
Lab at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,
and the Brian Counterman Lab at Mississippi State
University. The postdoc's research will specically focus
on regulatory evolution of the wing pattern morphogen
gene WntA, which underlies development of the ma-
jor central wing patterns. The regulation of this gene
has diversied dramatically within and between species,
and population genetic work shows that variation inSeptember 1, 2018 EvolDir 133
expression can be traced to regulatory regions adjacent
to WntA. We are now working to ask the questions (1)
what are the cis-regulatory elements that drive the evo-
lution of WntA expression, (2) how did these regulatory
elements rst arise, and (3) how are these elements evolv-
ing to produce morphological variation? We are asking
this question both within species (Heliconius mimicry)
and between species (the family Nymphalidae). Our
primary experimental approach is to combine whole-
genome comparative assays of regulatory element ac-
tivity (ATAC-seq) with functional validation (CRISPR
and reporter constructs). The successful candidate will
be encouraged to visit and work in collaborating labs
depending on specic experimental goals. The postdoc
will produce rst-author publications representing their
own intellectually independent work.
TO APPLY Please submit IN A SINGLE PDF FILE:
(i) a cover letter including motivation and research in-
terests, (ii) a full CV that includes all requisites for
the position, and (iii) contact information for two ref-

Dear all,
we still have a few places available for our Speciation
Genomics course
in Berlin (03-07 December 2018) with Dr. Mark Ravinet
(CEES, Univeristy of Oslo, Norway) and Dr. Joana I.
Meier (University of Cambridge, UK).
Overview
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
growing eld of speciation genomics. The course aims
to take students from the initial steps required for han-
dling raw sequencing data to demographic modelling
and inference of genome-wide signatures of selection
and introgression. Through a combination of lectures
covering key theoretical and conceptual topics, along-
side hands-on exercises, participants will learn the most
important computational approaches used in speciation
genomics. This will include a heavy emphasis on data
visualization and intepretation. After completing of
the course, the participants should be able to begin
using NGS data to shed light on the genomic aspects of
speciation in their study system of choice.
Format
This course is designed for researchers and graduate
students with strong interests in applying novel high-
throughput DNA sequencing technologies to study the
population genomic basis of speciation. The course will
mainly focus on the analysis of NGS data for study
systems for which a reference genome is available. We
will provide theoretical lectures and hands-on exercises
drawing on examples of whole-genome resequenced and
RAD-sequencing data. Participants will make use of
the UNIX command line, R and Python throughout the
course.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background in
evolution and genomics. No programming or scripting
expertise is required. Previous experience in UNIX-
based command line and R is an advantage but a stan-dard introduction will be provided. All hands-on ex-
ercises will be run in a Linux environment on remote
servers. Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStu-
dio.
Learning Outcomes
Handling NGS data from raw reads to genetic variants
Applying basic population genetic statistics Visualiz-
ing the genetic structure Inferring demographic history
Identifying regions under divergent selection or barriers
to gene ow Understanding the potential and limitations
of dierent methods to detect regions under selection

Course: Introduction to Python for Biologists
Berlin, 15-19 October 2018
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
biologists)
Course overview This course is aimed at complete be-
ginners and assumes no prior programming experience.
It gives an overview of the language with an empha-
sis on practical problem-solving, using examples and
exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics
work. After completing the course, students should be
in a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to
tackling problems in their own research and (2) continue
their Python education in a self-directed way. All course
materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared by
the instructing team) will be provided electronically to
participants.
Intended audience
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned138 EvolDir September 1, 2018
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. If in doubt,
take a look at the detailed session content below or
drop Martin Jones (martin@pythonforbiologists.com)
an email.
Teaching format:
The course is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background:
Students should have enough biological background to
appreciate the examples and exercise problems (i.e. they
should know about DNA and protein sequences, what
translation is, and what introns and exons are). No
previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary,
but you'll need to have a laptop with Python installed.

Overview
This course will introduce students, researchers and pro-
fessionals into the eld of using genomics data to identify
meaningful genomic regions. The course comprises two
approaches: one based only on genomic information,
which will use populations genetics techniques to detect
signatures of selection (both natural and articial); the
other approach will combine genomic and phenotypic
data to identify genetic associations for specic pheno-
types (i.e. GWAS, genome-wide association studies).
Format
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include an introductory lecture with class dis-
cussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning how to make
use of genomic information to study how selection has
shaped the genome and how the genome inuences mea-
surable phenotypes. It will include information useful
for both beginners and more advanced users. We will
start by introducing general concepts of population ge-netics, which will take up most of the rst half of the
course; the second half of the course will be centered
mainly on GWAS and related aspects.
Attendees should have a background in biology, specif-
ically genetics. There will be a mix of lectures and
hands-on practical exercises using R and the Linux
command line, and bespoke software. Some basic under-
standing of R programming and the Linux environment
will be advantageous. Attendees should have also some
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments, including genotyping-by-sequencing
(GBS), and commercial genotyping platforms.

INSTRUCTORS:
Dr. Ayshwarya Subramanian (Broad Institute of MIT
and Harvard)
Dr. Dana Silverbush (Broad Institute of MIT and Har-
vard)
Dr. Ehsan Habibi (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard)
Course overview
In recent years single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has140 EvolDir September 1, 2018
become widely used for transcriptome analysis in many
areas of biology. In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-
seq provides quantitative measurements of the expres-
sion of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze
scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some
of the underlying assumptions for the methods devel-
oped for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid.
In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq
processing, starting from the raw reads coming o the
sequencer. The course includes common analysis strate-
gies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss
the central biological questions that can be addressed
using scRNA-seq.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The
material is suitable both for experimentalists who want
to learn more about data-analysis as well as computa-
tional biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq
methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can
be applied to any experimental protocol or biological
system.
The requirements for this course are:
i- Working knowledge of unix (managing les, running
programs)
ii- Programming experience in R (writing a function,
basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages).
iii- Bioconductor experience is a plus.
iv- Familiarity with NGS data and its analyses (using
alignment and quantication tools for bulk sequencing
data)
Teaching Format
The course will be delivered over the course of ve days.
Each day will include a lecture and laboratory compo-
nent. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion
and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical
hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will
be done using a combination of tools installed on the
attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed
via web browser.

Short course: The Search for Selection Venue: Roslin In-
stitute, University of Edinburgh Dates: Oct 15-19 2018,
Instructor: J. Bruce Walsh, Ecology & Evolutionary
Biology, Univ. of Arizona
Description Biologists are obsessed (indeed, seduced) by
the search for signatures of selection in organismal fea-
tures of interest, ranging from specic traits to genome-
wide signatures. A vast number of approaches have
been suggested in this search for selection, including
genomic-based signatures of recent or ongoing selection,
tests based on either excessive amounts or nonrandom
patterns of divergence (in both fossil sequences and
functional genomics data) and the more classical Lande-
Arnold tness estimates (direct association of pheno-
typic values with tness estimates) and their modern
extensions (such as aster models). Given the breadth
of such searches, a large amount of machinery has been
developed, but is rarely presented in a unied fashion.
This course presents an integrated overview of all these
approaches, highlighting common themes and divergent
assumptions.
The goal of this course is to expose investigators from
all branches of biology to this rich menagerie of tests,
applicable for population geneticists, genome biologists,
evolutionary ecologists, paleontologists, functional mor-
phologists, and just about any biologist who ponders onhow to formally demonstrate that a feature (or features)
of interest might have been shaped by selection.
Intended Audience. The intended audience is advanced
graduate students, postdocs, and faculty with an interest
in searching for targets of selection, be they particular
genomic sequences or specic traits. Given the breadth
of this topic, the material is of interest to students
from functional genomics, population and evolutionary
genetics, ecology, paleobiology, functional morphology,
and statistics (as well as other elds). Background re-
quired: some basic introduction to population and/or
quantitative genetics.
Optional Reading: This course is based on material
from Chapters 8-10, 12, and 29-30 in Walsh and Lynch
(2018) Evolution and Selection of Quantitative Traits
(Oxford). While this text is not required, it does present
much more detail discussion (with detailsed references)
of the material to be covered.

for this FREE National Science Foundation-sponsored
two-day workshop.
Registration page: http://go.iu.edu/21IC NCGAS is of-
fering a National Science Foundation-sponsored, two-day
workshop on high performance computing (HPC) usage144 EvolDir September 1, 2018
and de novo transcriptome assembly. It will take place
October 1-2 on the IU Bloomington campus. There are
limited spots on October 3 to have one-on-one consul-
tation sessions with NCGAS Sta. Registration is free,
but application is required.
The workshop will include discussions, lectures, and
hands-on tutorials to cover topics important to get-
ting started constructing and analyzing transcriptomes-
without the use of a ?genome. Material covers both the
availability and use of HPC resources, alongside the task
of assembling a new transcriptome, in order to provide
a more comprehensive preparation for this and future
bioinformatic tasks.
Transcriptome assembly will consist of using four sepa-
rate assemblers (Trinity, SOAP de novo, Velvet Oases,
and TransABySS), with multiple kmers, to be com-
bined and curated with Evigenes. This combined as-
sembly with multiple parameters is considered much
more robust than simply using one assembler, and the
NCGAS pipeline streamlines the process and allows for
customization if desired.
While material will make heavy use of XSEDE and IU
machines, the material is transferable to any cluster.

polyploids.html Objectives: Polyploidy is widespread
and frequent in plants (including many crops), but
also occurs in animals such as sh and amphibians.
However, our understanding of the genetics of polyploid
populations and populations of mixed ploidy is still
poor. This is mainly because population genetics
theory was originally developed for diploids. Moreover,
there is often a gap between theory developed for
polyploids and its practical implementation. This
practically-oriented course will attempt to bridge this
gap. Simulation-based exercises (among others using R)
will elucidate theoretical foundations of both diploid and
polyploid population genetics. Additionally, analyses of
real or realistic example datasets (microsatellite and
SNP markers) will give participants hands-on training
in several available methods for the population genetic
analysis of polyploids.
The exact course contents are not cast in stone, but will
include clustering methods with specic attention for
the problem of mixed ploidy, evolutionary history recon-
struction of polyploid complexes, the eect of mating
system variation, and detection of linked selection in
polyploid genomes. Participants will also devote time
to a group project focused on application of gathered
knowledge in further modelling or on analyses of sample
or own datasets and discussion of further prospects and
methods limitations.
Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of R programming lan-
guage and general knowledge of population genetic foun-
dations of diploid populations (diversity, dierentiation,
inbreeding). Experience in scripting in R is useful, but
for the beginners there will be an extra R-introductory
day before the workshop start.
Costs: course participation is free (!) and includes food
and accommodation, but travel arrangements are at
own cost. Please apply to participate using the link to
the registration form on
https://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2018/-

Environmental DNA is increasingly used as a monitoring
tool for aquatic and even some terrestrial species. This
week-long workshop will provide a detailed introduction
to eDNA methodology and how to apply the method
into a monitoring framework. The workshop will have
lecture components, but will primarily focus on hands-
on lab exercises. The workshop is geared toward focal
species eDNA monitoring, although metabarcoding ap-
proaches will be discussed. The following topics will be
included:
* Overview of eDNA case studies using both water and
soil sampling * Collection and ltering of water and
soil samples in the eld * Designing primers for species-
specic amplication * Laboratory extraction and am-
plication of eDNA samples using qPCR * Interpreting
results and analytical tools for using eDNA in monitor-
ing programs.
At the end of the week, each participant will have col-
lected, extracted, and analyzed their own eDNA samples.
Participants will also work in groups to design and im-
plement a small eDNA research study during the course
of the week.
This workshop is targeted toward both professionals
and graduate students with limited rst-hand experi-
ence with eDNA that are looking to learn more about
the method or develop their own eDNA projects. No
previous experience is required, although some prior

The school will be held in the University eld station
^ aHerdershut' on the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog
from October 21 - 26 2018.
We are very happy to announce that this year we
will have two special guest lecturers: Dr <https://-
trishaatwood.weebly.com/people.html >Trisha B At-
wood (Utah State University) and Dr <http://-
www.shaipilosof.info/ >Shai Pilosof (University of
Chicago).
Dr Atwood is assistant professor and chair of the Aquatic
Ecology and Global Change Lab. She and her team
members are interested in three broad research themes
across all aquatic ecosystems (marine, estuarine, fresh-
water, and riparian zones). 1. The eects of global
change on aquatic food webs and species interactions.
2. How food webs and species interactions inuence
ecosystem function. 3. The role of aquatic ecosystems
in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conserva-
tion.
By focusing on these three broad questions, her research
has taken her all over the world with studies in Hawaii,
Canada, Costa Rica, and Australia (including The Great
Barrier Reef).148 EvolDir September 1, 2018
Dr Pilosof is postdoctoral scholar at the University of
Chicago, ^ athe lab of Mercedes Pascual. He is mostly
interested in the application of network theory to ecolog-
ical systems, specically in the eld of disease ecology.
He uses a complex systems approach to study the fac-
tors that eect spread of disease in animal communities
and from animals to humans. His research is unique as
it takes the individual point of view: 1. What is the
role of individual heterogeneity in shaping host-parasite
interactions at the community level? 2. How does ge-
netic variation aect infection with parasites in dierent
hosts? 3. How does individual heterogeneity translate
to eciency of disease spread in host communities?
Scope of the course
The research elds community and ecosystem ecology
have diverged more or less independently over the last
decennia. In community ecology progress is made in
understanding shifts in community composition under
the inuence of environmental change and how these
shifts can be explained by functional trait approaches
of component species. Also, the importance of positive
feedbacks in community dynamics is more and more
appreciated, and merged with trophic interactions in
ecological networks. Studies in ecosystem ecology tra-
ditionally have a strong focus on energy and nutrient
uxes and how deviation in these uxes aect ecosystem
functioning and stability. Recent studies reveal tight
links between these sub-disciplines that enforce us to
rethink how communities and ecosystems interact.
This course focuses on theoretical concepts, such as au-
tocatalytic loops and positive and negative feedbacks
between organisms in ecological networks as well as the
importance of non-trophic interactions by ecosystem
engineers. The course will address how these principles
can be used to link communities to ecosystems enabling
a better understanding of how environmental changes
aect community and ecosystem dynamics. Students
will construct ecological networks of their own study
system or based on literature data and analyze these
using structural equation modelling.
Course Set-up
The course is composed of a series of lectures, a poster
session, analyzing ecological networks using structural
equation modelling and nalized with a debating session.
Poster session: Prior to the course, participants submit
a poster of their work (A4-size) in PDF, which will be
printed and included in the course reader. The poster
contains your name and aliation, title and short de-
scription of research project (including concepts) with
one highlight (something exciting) and the reason you
want to participate in this course. During the course,participants briey pitch their research (maximum 3
slides) and indicate where they would like to receive
input from the course participants and lecturers.
Lectures and discussion: Each day starts with a key
speaker who will give a lecture on one of the key course
topics (covering both general theory and own research).
After the lecture we'll have a discussion which is con-
vened by three participants who challenge the speaker on
the lecture and two papers that the speaker submitted
which are related to the topic of the lecture (participants
will receive these before the course to prepare them self).
Group activities: In the afternoons, participants will be
split into working groups, which will work on specic
group assignments

Introduction to bioinformatics for DNA and RNA se-
quence analysis (IBDR01)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-bioinformatics-for -dna-and-rna-sequence-analysis-
ibdr01/
This course will be delivered by Dr Malachi and Obi
Grith from the 29th October - 2 November 2018 in
Glasgow city centre.
Course Overview:
Analysis of high throughput genome and transcriptome
data is major component of many research projects rang-
ing from large-scale precision medicine eorts to focused
investigations in model systems. This analysis involves
the identication of specic genome or transcriptome
features that predispose individuals to disease, predict
response to therapies, inuence diagnosis/prognosis, or
provide mechanistic insights into disease models. During
this course (IBDR01), students will perform an example
end-to-end bioinformatics analysis of genome (WGS and
Exome) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. Students
will start with raw sequence data for a hypothetical case,
learn to install and use the tools needed to analyze this
data on the cloud, and visualize and interpret results.September 1, 2018 EvolDir 149
After completing the course, students should be in a po-
sition to (1) understand raw sequence data formats, (2)
perform bioinformatics analyses on the cloud, (3) run
complete analysis pipelines for alignment, variant call-
ing, annotation, and RNA-seq (transcriptome analysis
approaches will be a major component of the workshop),
(4) visualize and interpret whole genome, exome and
RNA-seq results, (5) leverage the identication of pas-
senger variants for immunotherapy applications, and (6)
begin to place these results in a clinical context by use
of variant knowledgebases. The data, tools, and analysis
will be most directly relevant to human genomics and
bioinformatics research. However, many of the skills and
concepts covered will be applicable to other human dis-
eases and model organisms. Furthermore, many analysis
concepts covered during the workshop will be broadly
applicable to other \big data" research problems. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
Intended Audience
This workshop is primarily aimed at researchers and
technical workers with a background in biology who
want to learn fundamental bioinformatics skills for ge-
nomics with a particular emphasis on biomedical re-
search applications. The course is essentially a crash
course in bioinformatics for next generation sequence
data analysis. It would also be useful for students with
a computational background who seek an introduction
to genomics technology and analysis approaches. In gen-
eral, it is suitable for anyone working with genome or
transcriptome (RNA-seq) data in the context of disease
research. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own
data or project outlines for discussion. Some time during
the course will be dedicated to consultation with a team
of instructors from the McDonnell Genome Institute.
Monday 29th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1. Introduction to genomics and bioinformat-
ics. In this session, students will be introduced to key
concepts of genomics and their application to genomics
research and precision medicine in cancer. An intro-
duction to next-generation sequencing platforms and
related bioinformatics approaches will also be provided.
Core concepts and tools introduced: fundamentals of
genome and transcriptome analysis, next-generation se-
quencing, precision/personalized medicine approaches
(using cancer as an exemplar disease).
Session 2. Introduction to genomics data, le formats,
QC, and cloud analysis.
In this session, students will be introduced to a hypo-thetical patient case and related samples to be analyzed
throughout the course. Students will be provided with
an introduction to the whole genome, exome, transcrip-
tome and other data sets we have generated for this
test case. Information on where to get the raw data
and how to access it (and other test data) will be pro-
vided. Using this data as an example, the students will
learn fundamentals of next generation sequence (NGS)
data formats. The students will also be introduced
to accessory les needed for analysis including refer-
ence genomes, reference transcriptomes, and annotation
les. Tools for QC analysis of raw data will be demon-
strated. Since most analysis will be performed on the
cloud, each student will learn how to launch and log
into their own cloud compute environment. Students
will learn how to install bioinformatics tools and learn
to use some of the most broadly useful tool kits for NGS
data. Core concepts and tools introduced: le formats
(Fasta, FastQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF, GTF), bed-

Phylogenetic comparative methods for studying diversi-
cation and phenotypic evolution (PCME01)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/phylogenetic-
comparative-methods-for-studying-diversication-and-
phenotypic-evolution-pcme01/ This course will be
delivered by Dr. Antigoni Kaliontzopoulou in Glasgow
City Centre from 5th - 8th November 2018.
Please feel free to share anywhere you see t.
Course Overview: Phylogenetic comparative methods
are commonly used nowadays to investigate how species
diversication occurs and to test hypotheses about the
mechanisms that drive phenotypic evolution, e.g. to
model speciation and extinction, to understand why
some groups are more diverse than others, to test150 EvolDir September 1, 2018
whether phenotypic traits have evolved under neutral,
directional or diversifying selection, to investigate how
evolutionary rates are modied across the evolutionary
history of a group etc. In all these cases, a phyloge-
netic hypothesis for the group of interest is combined
to phenotypic and ecological data at the species level to
understand the tempo and mode of evolutionary change.
The objective of this course is to provide an overview of
these methods and of the tools available for their imple-
mentation in the R statistical language. During theoreti-
cal sessions, we will review the main concepts and statis-
tical tools necessary for testing hypotheses about species
diversication and phenotypic evolution. These will
then be implemented during practical's through worked
examples to provide the participants with hands-on ex-
perience on data management and the implementation
of these methods to real biological data.
Intended Audience Research postgraduates, practicing
academics and primary investigators in evolutionary
ecology with interest for any kind of studies involving
evolutionary inferences across phylogenetically related
species.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
