Computational Methods for Inferring SNP Function:
Integrating Evolutionary, Structural, and Comparative
Genomics MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
July 19, 2004
A Paciﬁc Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) 2005
Session January 4-8 at the Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii
http://psb.stanford.edu http://psb.stanford.edu/cfp-
snps.html Summary ——- Single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) are the most prevalent form of ge-
netic variation within populations. Recent technolog-
ical advances have enabled the accumulation of mas-
sive amounts of data on SNPs ( >15 million entries inJuly 1, 2004 EvolDir 3
dbSNP) from within a wide range of species (e.g., hu-
man, Drosophila, Anopheles, mouse, dog, Arabidopsis,
maize, and Plasmodium). Upcoming sequences of the
chimpanzee and rat genomes provide the possibility for
comparison of population genetic variation with species
divergence at the genome scale.
Although the majority of SNPs are likely to be neutral
both evolutionarily and functionally, some SNPs can
alter the structure or function of DNA, RNA, or pro-
teins. If these molecular changes aﬀect the organism’s
phenotype, natural selection can operate on the SNP
alleles. Because evolution acts on phenotypes which
impact survival and reproduction, the identiﬁcation of
functionally important variation is integral to impor-
tant research problems ranging from medicine and agri-
culture to basic genetics.
This session will focus on statistical and computational
methods for inferring functional SNPs and their con-
sequences, with an emphasis on novel approaches that
merge population and comparative genomics. The re-
cent avalanche of SNP data has led to rapid devel-
opment of new techniques and models in a variety
of research disciplines, and we encourage manuscript
submissions that combine approaches from ﬁelds such
as bioinformatics, computational biology, evolutionary
and human genetics, and molecular and cellular biology.
Session Topics ————– Possible manuscript topics in-
clude (but are not limited to):
* Comparative genomic methods for detecting SNPs
that aﬀect gene regulation * Biophysical studies inves-
tigating the eﬀect of SNPs on protein structure and
function * Association (linkage) studies pursuing the
detection of correlation among SNP variants with spe-
ciﬁc phenotypes * Population genetic models for detect-
ing natural selection on SNPs * Novel approaches for
integrating microarray data and evolutionary analysis
Session Chairs ————– * Carlos Bustamante, Cornell
University cdb28@cornell.edu * Shamil Sunyaev, Har-
vard University ssunyaev@rics.bwh.harvard.edu * Matt
Dimmic, Cornell University mwd8@cornell.edu
Papers, Oral Presentations, Posters, and Demonstra-
tions
——————————————————-
The core of the conference consists of peer-reviewed full-
length papers reporting on original work. All submitted
papers will be subject to rigorous review by several ref-
erees, and must represent original, unpublished results
which are not currently under consideration elsewhere.
Accepted papers will be fully indexed in Medline and
published by PSB in its hard-bound archival proceed-
ings. In addition, a limited number of papers will beselected for oral presentation. Because PSB sessions are
conducted sequentially, these talks will be presented to
the entire conference.
Researchers who wish to present their research without
publication in the proceedings are encouraged to share
their results and ideas in the poster session. Posters will
be displayed throughout the conference, and computer
workstations are also available for software demonstra-
tions and Web site presentation. To be included in the
poster abstract book distributed at the conference, a
one-page abstract must be submitted by November 1
to Larry Altman at altman@smi.stanford.edu. Poster
abstracts are not peer-reviewed.
Conference Deadlines ——————– * Full manuscript
submissions due: July 19, 2004 * Notiﬁcation of paper
acceptance: August 30, 2004 * Poster/demo abstract
deadline: November 1, 2004 * Meeting: January 4-8,

Second announcement:
Symposium
Progress in Environmental Stress, Adaptation and Evo-
lutionJuly 1, 2004 EvolDir 5
August 22-26, 2004 at Sandbjerg, Denmark
Sponsors:
European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
Center for Environmental Stress Research and Faculty
of Sciences, University of Aarhus (DK)
Aim:
Most organisms and populations have to cope with hos-
tile environments, threatening their existence. Their
ability to respond phenotypically and genetically to
these challenges and to evolve adaptive mechanisms is,
therefore, crucial. The aim of the symposium is to un-
derstand, from an evolutionary perspective, the impact
of stress on biological systems. We have invited speak-
ers that at diﬀerent organizational levels, from genes
to individuals and populations, explore how organisms
adapt to (extreme) environments genetically and phys-
iologically, how stress changes genetic structure and af-
fects life histories and how environmental and genetic
stress shape selection pressure and causes extinction of
populations.
These issues have already been dealt with in a sym-
posium on stress and evolutionduring the 5th Interna-
tional Congress of Evolutionary Biology and System-
atics in Budapest (1966), and in the end resulted in
a book edited by us Environmental Stress, Adaptation
and Evolution (1997)published in the Birkh¨ auser EXS
series (EXS 83). It is now nearly ten years later and
knowledge and (genomic) techniques in this research
ﬁeld have progressed rapidly. Therefore, we are think-
ing a follow-up to be timely and are organising this
small, 3 day symposium on the same issues
Structure:
The number of participants will be limited to around
50, of which 15 are reserved for invited speakers (for list
see below). There will be room for maximal 40 presen-
tations of which 25 are open for contributed talks (25
min.). In conjunction with the symposium a special
thematic issue of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology
will be published on the topic that will contain high
quality papers by the invited speakers. In addition, it
will be possible for contributed papers to be included
in this special issue of JEB. This will ensure that the
papers get lots of exposure in this thematic setting. Pa-
pers for the special issue will be selected by the organis-
ers of the symposium and the chief editor of JEB, Juha
Merila. Mind that all manuscripts, including those of
the invited speakers, will not be treated favourably for
this special issue. They are subject to normal, rigor-
ous peer-review and scope limits of the journal: they
have to address important evolutionary, and not purelyfunctional, problems.
Participation:
Those that are interested in the symposium topic
and want to participate and/or present a paper are
kindly invited to contact the organisers from now
on. Please do send your application to Corneel
Vermeulen ( <mailto:c.j.vermeulen@biol.rug.nl >
c.j.vermeulen@biol.rug.nl) who will collect
and structure applications (but for safety
do send also a cc to both Volker Loeschcke
(<mailto:volker.loeschcke@biology.au.dk >
volker.loeschcke@biology.au.dk) and Kuke
Bijlsma ( <mailto:r.bijlsma@biol.rug.nl >
r.bijlsma@biol.rug.nl)), not later than the 7th of
June. As we, in addition to the invited speakers,
can only accommodate around 35 participants, the
symposium might easily become full. If this is
the case the organisers will select participants and
contributions that seem to ﬁt that symposium and
the special volume of JEB the best. Therefore it is
important that tentative participants provide a few
lines about their research interests, and if they want to
present a contribution, please provide also a title and
a substantial abstract (up to 200 words). Membership
of ESEB is not prerequisite, but gives a discount of the
conference fee and might give some priority.

Dear Colleague,
the program of the 7th congress Molecular Epidemiol-
ogy and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases(MEEGID VII), to be held in Valencia, Spain, 19th-
22nd July 2004, is now ﬁnalized. Human biology re-
lated to the transmission and severity of infectious dis-
eases has been given much importance, with 2 plenary
lectures and a 3-way debates of 2 hours. Many com-
munications dealing with parasites, bacteria, viruses,
vectors, will be held. I recall that MEEGID VII is
organized in connection with the 9th European Multi-
colloquium of Parasitology (EMOP 9). A special issue
of Infection, Genetics and Evolution will be published
with the abstracts and selected papers.
Still time to register!

of view of the mean returns to be gained from al-
ternative ﬁtness enhancing options (e.g. mean ﬁt-
ness when producing many small oﬀspring versus few
large oﬀspring). However, risk-sensitive foraging has
highlighted the importance of variance when consider-
ing such adaptive decision-making. Depending on the
shape of the ﬁtness function, individuals should be risk-
averse (playing it safe) or risk-prone (gamblers). Evi-
dence to support these predictions has been around for
a number of years in the foraging literature (see Real
& Caraco 1986 Ann. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 17, 371-390).
However, few attempts have been made to apply such
thinking to a wider range of evolutionary problems.
The purpose of this PhD will be to re-examine existing
theory and data, and to carry out original experiments
to test whether risk-sensitivity has applications outside
the study of foraging behaviour.

Evolutionary Ecology and Systematics
My research focuses on the evolutionary ecology and
systematics of morning glories. I have an opening for
a masters student in my lab at Southeastern Louisiana
University in Hammond, LA, which will be supported
on an RA (stipend and tuition waiver). I generally view
our program as an excellent opportunity for young sci-
entists to carry out independent research before making
a commitment to a Ph.D. program. SELU has an excel-
lent and active group of biologists (see Graduate Fac-
ulty Research Interests at www.selu.edu/Academics/-
Depts/Biology ) and together we provide an exciting en-
vironment to carry out research.
A wide range of studies related to my current research
would make excellent master’s projects. Investigations
could include such topics as the pattern of selectionJuly 1, 2004 EvolDir 9
and constraints aﬀecting life history traits, evolution
of reaction norms, phylogenetic systematics, adaptive
radiation, and taxonomy. I use morning glories as a
model system and have made good progress towards de-
veloping a well-resolved phylogeny for groups of these
species. It is a morphologically diverse group of plants
found in the subtropics and tropics worldwide with per-
haps as many as 1000 species.
I have a well-equipped new molecular lab in a new biol-
ogy building, we have a new greenhouse, growth cham-
bers, and I am in the process of developing experimental
gardens.
The natural history of the area is fascinating, includ-
ing longleaf pine savannas and cypress-tupelo swamps.
Hammond is one CD away from New Orleans (you put
a CD in the player and when its ﬁnished, there you are)
with its great music, art, and cuisine.

UAuckland Yeast
PhD scholarships (2)
Research Field: Yeast molecular genetics Research
Topic: Wine aroma Institution: University of Auck-
land Academic supervisors: Prof. Richard Gardner, Dr
Mat Goddard
Description: The chemical constituents of some of the
major aromas and ﬂavours in Sauvignon Blanc have
recently been elucidated. Three of the most dominant
aromas are derived from ﬂavour-active volatile thiols.
These are formed during the fermentation of the wine
by yeast, which convert ﬂavourless, non-volatile pre-
cursors (cysteine conjugates) that are present in grape
juice. The goal of the project is to develop yeast strains
with diﬀering eﬃciencies of conversion of the various
thiol compounds.
PhD student 1 (Supervisor: Richard Gardner) will
identify and characterise the genes responsible for up-
take and conversion of the thiol precursors.
PhD student 2 (Supervisor: Mat Goddard) will analysethe genetic variation of the trait and the genes among
commercial wine yeast strains and natural populations
of wine yeasts.
Qualiﬁcations: Applicants must have an MSc, BSc
hons, or equivalent in a relevant subject. Practical ex-
perience of molecular genetics or biochemistry, espe-
cially with yeast, is an advantage.
Stipend: The PhD studentships pay $25,000 per annum
and full fees.
Start date: After July 1 2004 (PhD1) or after Nov 1
2004 (PhD2).
Applications: Please email cv (including names and
email addresses of three referees) and covering letter
to Cathy Corbett (c.corbett@auckland.ac.nz). There is
no closing date.
Further information: Both students will be based
in yeast genetics labs in the School of Bio-
logical Sciences at the University of Auckland
(www.sbs.auckland.ac.nz ). The research maintains
close contacts with analytical chemists (Laura Nico-
lau, Paul Kilmartin) in the wine science programme
(www.che.auckland.ac.nz/wine ). The work is part
of a new, 6-year, FRST-funded project that is cur-
rently investigating the potential of New Zealand1s
Sauvignon Blanc wines. The project includes ex-
pertise in viticulture and sensory science and has
strong links with the New Zealand wine industry
(www.nzwine.com ). More information on the projects
can be obtained from r.gardner@auckland.ac.nz or
m.goddard@imperial.ac.uk. The University of Auck-
land is New Zealand1s largest University and SBS is the
top-ranked biology department nationally. The Univer-
sity is situated in the heart of the cosmopolitan city
of Auckland and provides an exciting and stimulating
environment for 26,000 students. Auckland has a pop-
ulation of 1 million people and is located adjacent to

PhD student position to work on ant genomics
A PhD student position is available for 3 years in the
lab of Professor Laurent Keller ( http://www.unil.ch/-
dee/page7717 en.html ). Our group is interested in the
principles governing the behavior, ecology, and evolu-
tion of animal societies. While this is richly described
by theory, how this is translated to the molecular level
is virtually unknown. One aim of our group is to use ge-
nomic techniques to identify candidate genes and path-ways that are associated with the biology of social in-
sects. In particular, we are using use cDNA microarrays
to examine gene expression in ﬁre ants. Ultimately, our
goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underly-
ing these processes. Possible topics include, but are not
limited to, social behavior, caste determination, evolu-
tion and aging.
Candidates should be highly motivated and have a good
background in molecular, genomic or cell biology. Good
knowledge of English is required.
Interested applicants should send a short summary of
research interests and experiences (in English) a cur-
riculum vitae as well as the names and emails and phone
numbers of 2 references to John Wang by email.

PHD POSITION: HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY GE-
NOMICS
A PhD position is available immediately in the group of
Henrik Kaessmann at the recently founded Center for
Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Switzer-
land.
Currently we focus on the origin and evolution of pri-
mate genes and gene structures. New genes origi-
nate through various molecular mechanisms such as
the classic mechanisms of gene duplication (e.g. tan-
dem gene duplication), gene copying by retroposition,
exon/domain shuﬄing, and gene fusion. We pursue
several projects that aim to shed light on the rela-
tive importance of these mechanisms in generating pri-
mate genes. We are particularly interested in char-
acterizing the (adaptive) evolution of young genes in
the human genome that originated recently on the pri-
mate lineage and therefore may be relevant in regard
to human/hominoid-speciﬁc phenotypes. To this end,
we explore available data from genomic databases and
generate complementary data by experimental analysis.
For more information on the group and our institute
more generally, see the website: http://www.unil.ch/-
cigFor this position, I am seeking highly qualiﬁed and
motivated applicants with a strong interest in human
genome evolution and experimental lab work, because
we want to identify and characterize functional adap-July 1, 2004 EvolDir 11
tive changes of newly emerged genes. Thus, dedicated
biochemists or molecular biologists with an evolution-
ary interest are encouraged to apply as well.
The salary is approximately 30,000 Euros per year.
The language of the institute is English, and its mem-
bers form an international group that is rapidly expand-
ing. The institute is in Lausanne, a beautiful city at

PhD student position in Molecular Evolution: Com-
parative genome analyses of bacteria associated with
animals, plants and insects
Applicants are invited to a four-year graduate student
position in Molecular Evolution at the Department of
Evolution, Genomics and Systematics, Evolutionary
Biology Centre, Uppsala University, focusing on the ex-
ploration of similarities and diﬀerences between bacte-
ria that live as symbionts and parasites of plants and
animals.
Genomics is revolutionizing the ﬁeld of microbiology.
We have sequenced the typhus pathogen genome, one
of the ﬁrst 20 genomes completed worldwide. Addi-
tionally, we have sequenced the genome of an aphid
endosymbiont (Buchnera) as well as the genomes of
pathogens causing the trench fever (Bartonella quin-July 1, 2004 EvolDir 13
tana) and cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae).
Our studies have shown that the genomes of intracel-
lular pathogens have been extensively reduced in size,
whereas soil microorganisms that interact with plants
have evolved by expansion of their genetic material.
Still, very little is known about the forces and mech-
anisms that drive reductions and expansions of gene
contents and gene functions, and how these relate to
the diﬀerent types of host-cell interactions. We intend
to recruit a PhD student to study the origin, diversity
and function of proteins and metabolic networks of bac-
teria that have evolved close relationships with higher
eukaryotes. The projects will involve both experimental
and bioinformatic analyses. The successful candidate
will have the opportunity to interact with our collabo-
rators in Canada. External funding is available for this
project from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Re-
search (SSF) from a collaborative grant with Genome-
Canada.
The group belongs to the Department of Evolution,
Genomics and Systematics ( http://www.egs.uu.se/ ),
which is part of the Evolutionary Biology Centre. Infor-mation about this centre and its coordinated postgrad-
uate education is available at http://www.ebc.uu.se/
.The work will be performed within the research group
“Comparative microbial genomics”. Interested can-
didates are welcome to contact prof. Siv Ander-
sson http://artedi.ebc.uu.se/molev/staﬀ/staf/people/-

Applicants are requested to have a BSc or MSc in
molecular biotechnology, biology or a related ﬁeld,
preferably including courses in molecular biology, bioin-
formatics and microbiology. Please send a written ap-
plication, including complete curriculum vitae, brief de-
scription of career goals, copies of honor’s thesis or sim-
ilar, the names and e-mail addresses of two references,

RESEARCH ASSOCIATE POSITIONS IN SPATIAL
STATISTICS/STATISTICAL GENETICS
Two positions are available within a programme of col-
laborative research between the Lancaster Statistics
Group and the Veterinary School at Liverpool Univer-
sity. Within the Statistics Group, the research will be
led by Prof. Peter Diggle, Prof. Gareth Roberts and
Dr. Paul Fearnhead.
The Department: The Lancaster Statistics Group is
one of the strongest in the UK (RAE Grade 6*) with
an emphasis on the development and application of
methodology motivated by substantive applications,
and particular strengths in spatial and longitudinal
statistics, statistical genetics and computationally in-
tensive statistical methods. The Group currently in-
cludes 16 academic staﬀ positions and around 30 re-
search students and research associates.
The research programme: The overall aim of the re-
search is to further our understanding of the transmis-
sion and evolution of food-borne zoonotic pathogens.16 EvolDir July 1, 2004
A speciﬁc aim is to model the spatio-temporal distri-
bution and genetic evolution of human Campylobacter
infections, using data derived from all recorded cases
of human campylobacter gastroenteritis in the Preston
district since 1993.
Position 1: spatial epidemiology. The primary focus
of the post-holder will be to develop novel methods of
spatio-temporal statistical analysis which can take ac-
count of genetic information on individual cases, and
to apply these, and existing methods, to the Preston
data-set. The post-holder will also be expected to assist
with general statistical input to the wider programme
of collaborative research, which is likely to involve the
innovative application of existing spatial and/or longi-
tudinal statistical methods.
This position is available for a four-year period, begin-
ning 1 April 2005.
Position 2: statistical genetics. The primary focus of
the post-holder will be to develop suitable stochastic
models and inference methods for population genetic
data from pathogens such as Campylobacter, and to
apply such methods to learn about the biological fac-
tors which aﬀect the evolution of Campylobacter. The
methods for analysing the population genetic data will
involve the use of modern, computationally-intensive
statistical methods.
This position is available for a two-year period, begin-
ning 1 April 2005.
The applicant: Applicants should have a higher degree
in statistics, a commitment to collaborative research
and either a track-record or clear potential for research
in statistics. For Position 1, previous experience of epi-
demiological research or spatial statistics are desirable.
For Position 2, experience of computationally-intensive
statistical methods and good computing skills are de-
sirable. Background in population genetics would also
be useful but is not essential.
Salary: Both appointments will be made on the RA1A
scale, currently 18,893to 28,279 pounds per year. Ini-
tial salary will depend on the age and experience of the
appointee.
Application procedure: To apply or receive further in-
formation online, please visit http://www.lancs.ac.uk/-

(salary £13,547 pa, full time, 12 months) Closing date
30th June 2004
Applications are invited for the above position to work
on a project investigating the evolution and breakdown
of C4 photosynthesis. Experience of general lab work
is essential, and relevent experience of techniques in
plant ecology, physiology or biochemistry, and with
the maintenance of plants in controlled environment
experiments, would be advantageous. The successful
candidate will be expected to undertake a variety of
tasks, including general laboratory upkeep, the main-
tenance and running of controlled environment exper-
iments, routine morphological, physiological and bio-
chemical measurements of plants, and the preparation
of data for analysis.
Project details
Mechanisms Driving the Evolution and Breakdown of
C4 Photosynthesis
The convergent evolution of C4 photosynthesis in more
than 30 plant groups was comparatively recent, but
these plants now dominate subtropical ecosystems and
account for 25% of global photosynthesis. Despite
their importance, the evolutionary mechanisms under-
pinning the rise of C4 plants are a major unsolved puz-
zle in biology. The leading hypothesis suggests that
past episodes of low atmospheric CO2 selected for the
C4 CO2-concentrating mechanism, thereby overcoming
the CO2-starvation problem of C3 plants in hot cli-
mates. But recent evidence points to a more complex
situation involving interactions with growth partition-
ing, resource-use and plant life history. This project will
therefore develop the ﬁrst explicit experimental test of
the CO2-starvation hypothesis, investigating how pho-
tosynthetic beneﬁts of C4 plants impact on whole-plant
traits in low CO2. Experiments utilizing new state-of-the-art growth facilities at the University of Sheﬃeld
will examine the African grass Alloteropsis semialata,
a species unique in having C4 and C3 sub-species. Re-
ports of C3-C4 intermediates in A. semialata from high
elevations suggest the intriguing additional hypothesis
that expression of C4 metabolism may be lost when this
plant grows in cool conditions. A further aim of the
project will therefore be to test C4 CO2-concentrating
eﬃciency at a range of growth temperatures. The work

PROJECT BACKGROUND
The aim of this project is to determine whether changes
in breeding time and other ﬁtness related traits that
have occurred in response to recent climate change are
consequences of adaptive microevolutionary responses
or phenotypic plasticity in a natural population of
North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsoni-
cus. Furthermore, we aim to ascertain whether it pos-22 EvolDir July 1, 2004
sible for phenotypic plasticity to evolve under natu-
ral selection such as might be mediated by changing
environmental conditions and in light of potential ge-
netic and ecological constraints. To address these aims,
we will 1) investigate the genetic mechanisms under-
lying the phenotypic responses to changing environ-
mental conditions in a natural system, and 2) exper-
imentally manipulate individual environmental condi-
tions to alter the potential for evolution in the direc-
tion of expected climate change. The Kluane Lake,
Yukon red squirrel population that has been monitored
for over 15 years in a region that has experienced dra-
matic changes in spring temperature. The pedigree of
this population will be reconstructed using microsatel-
lites to infer relationships and measure relatedness be-
tween marked individuals. A postdoctoral researcher
supported by the same research grant will conduct
the quantitative genetic analyses, and possibly, some
of the genotyping. See also: http://www.shef.ac.uk/-

Autopolyploids
Dear EvolDir Members,
Does anyone know of sister species (or a clade at
any level, whole genus, etc) in which all members are
(1) polyploid (2) look like they have inherited that
ploidy from a common ancestor, and (3) all have (or
are reputed to have, or have anecdotal evidence for )
polysomic inheritance?
Or, to ask the question more directly:
Are their any groups of species that have inherited
polysomic inheritance from their common ancestor?
and by implication,
Does speciation ever happen faster than polysomic in-
heritance gives way to disomic inheritance?

Bayesian burn-in
Dear Members, Following are the answers I received
regarding determining Burn-in in Bayesian analysis.
Some of you requested me to post them. -Jenny
Dear Jenny, It is only the likelihood sampled from the
cold chain that matters (the hot chains are used to ex-
plore the parameter space). This will be recorded in
your ’.p’ ﬁle along with the values of the other contin-
uous parameters. You can either load this into Excel
and plot it or you could try our program Tracer:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software/tracer which is
speciﬁcally designed for analyzing output from
Bayesian MCMC. You can use this to plot posterior
distributions of your parameters and look at the trace
in order to check for adequate mixing and burn in.
Tracer will also estimate the ESS or eﬀective sample
size, a statistic which tells you the equivalent number of
independent samples in your output. The samples from
an MCMC will be correlated which is why you only
sample every (say) 100th generation. If the MCMC
is mixing badly or you have a large dataset then even
sampling every 100th will produce correlated samples.
This is not a problem unless the ESS is very low (say
less than 100 or 200). Posterior estimates estimated
from runs with very low ESSs will have large errors
(these can also be calculated by Tracer - at least for
the continuous parameters).
Hope this helps.
Andrew
Jenny, Open the *.p (parameter) ﬁle in Excel and graph
the gens vs post probs–assuming your data has reason-
able structure, it should be quite obvious at what gen-
eration the values begin to plateau.
Cheers, Pete
Jenny,
I always run the “sump” command, which gives you a
rough plot of how the log likelihood has improved over
time. You can set the burnin for the sump command
until the log likelihood looks steady over the remain-
ing samples, then use the same burnin value for sumt.
Hope that helps,July 1, 2004 EvolDir 27
- Greg
Hi Jenny,
I used version 3 and I think there is a output ﬁle that
you can see the scores of all four chains. I actually open
this ﬁle from excel and make a plot, x-axis (generations)
vs. y-axis (scores) that you can see where the scores be-
come stabilize. The ’exact’ point of burn-in is not easy
to ﬁnd, so I always go some generations after/beyond
that so-called stabilizing point just to be safe and not
to include any generations when the scores were not
stabilized. I am not sure I am answering what you are
really asking for, :-)
Fengjie
Jenny, If you go to my web site (url below) and click
on “software” in the navigation bar, you will ﬁnd an
“mb-coda” archive with tools you can use to check for
convergence using the only diagnostic that we trust,
which is the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic (convergence is
deﬁned as the convergence of between-chain variance
on within-chain variance). The package consists of a
Perl script and an R script.
R is an open source implementation of a data analy-
sis language similar to S-Plus. To use mb-coda you
must ﬁrst install R and the R “coda” package of con-
vergence diagnostics. The coda package is the back-end
to our software, which just provides a convenient inter-
face with MrBayes output.
Arlin
There is a program called TRACER that can do that
for you. Joseph.

Subject: Other: burn-in in Bayesian analysis
Dear Member, We use MrBayes 3.0 for phylogenetic
analysis and have a question about determining the
generation of burn in. The Screen output of MrBayes
3.0 does not show a column of summarized likelihood
score over the diﬀerent chains as does in MrBayes 1.0
and 2.0. Does anyone know how to determine the Burin
in this case? We need to look at the scores for all
four chains to determine the generation when the score
starts to be come stabilized (if four chains are run) or
if there is a way to see the scores summarized over four
chains? Thanks for any help! Sincerely, Jenny Xiang

Thanks to those of you who donated books or other
items to our auction that will be held at this year’s Evo-

this month! Unfortunately, we still have not received
very many items. All of the money raised will go into
a newly-formed travel fund for students to get to the
meetings. This will be particularly important in 2007
when we will be meeting in New Zealand!
Please think about whether you have any items that
you could donate to the auction. It could be just about
anything - not just books! You could bring a case of
your best local microbrew! Do you or your spouse knit?
- how about a hand-made sweater? You have a nice
framed piece of art that just doesn’t ﬁt with your decor?
- bring that along and get rid of it! Have some cool old
ﬁrst edition books? - we’d be happy to take those as
well! Do you have nice pottery that you bought cause
you liked it, but you never use it? - sounds great! We
will gratefully accept literally ANYTHING that you
think will bring some money! The auction will take
place during the BBQ on Monday, June 28th.
Please contact me if you have something you would like
to contribute. Be generous! Think about how broke
you were when you were a grad student!! Also, don’t
forget to order a conference-logo or black death t-shirt!
You can get them via the T-Shirt link on the conference
website, not just at the time of registration. All proﬁts
from the shirts will also go to the travel fund.
Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Dr. Davis were once (February 2001) oﬀering 30 isofe-
male lines of D. melanogaster originated from the wild
nearby Leiden (Netherlands) in Evoldir.
I was wondering if someone still has these 30 isofemale
lines, and if so, if I could get a subset of them?

Fragment analysis
Subject: High-throughput fragment analysis
Dear EvolDir readers,
I am a Phd. student from the Netherlands, who would
like to gain some experience as a temporary guest at
a foreign research institute. I am looking for a molec-
ular lab with high-throughput capabilities (ie. refer-
ably robotic DNA extraction, robotic PCR and frag-
ment analysis on automatic sampling sequencer eg. an
ABI 3600) in order to make a genetic map of a Senecio
population using AFLPs. I am interested in a guest
position of approximately four months, beginning in
January, 2005 (needless to say, I will pay for the costs
of the materials that I will use). I have experience with
molecular methods. I have previously run AFLPs on
an ABI 377.
If anybody knows of such a lab in Europe, North Amer-
ica, or Australia, I would be greatful to hear from them
(kirk@rulsfb.leidenuniv.nl).
Thanks in advance,

Hexaploid microsatellites
Dear evoldir,
I am a MSc candidate in population genetics and
working with Geum triﬂorum (Prairie smoke) from
the Rosaceae family. G. triﬂorum is an allohexaploid
species and I have recently become interested in us-
ing nuclear microsatellite markers to study the genetic
structure of the species across it’s range. Since the
species is a hexaploid I am getting from 1 to 6 bands
per locus per sample, but I am unsure of how to score
the alleles. The parentals are believed to have been
two diploid species (Waldesteinia and Coluria) that
crossed to make a tetraploid and then backcrossed with
a diploid to form the hexaploid. However, I don’t think
it is known what diploid species the tetraploid was
crossed with. I would very much appreciate any incite
anyone might have into scoring G. triﬂorum microsatel-
lites or if it is feasible. Thank-you very much,

Hexaploid software
Dear all,
I am working with a perennial hexaploid species us-
ing Inter simple sequence repeat markers (dominant
marker 0 or 1). Only moment in time data is available.
The species can reproduce both sexually and asexually.
This violates Hardy-Weinberg. Is there a a population
genetics program I can use to analyze the dominant
marker data to obtain genetic diversity measures such
as Gst, Hs, Ht, percent polymorphic loci, and Ne? Or is
there any better measures that would be appropriate?
I would like to use this information to directly com-
pare diﬀerent populations under diﬀerent management
strategies.Thanks,

ItalianEvolBiol census
I apologize for cross-postings, but I am trying to reach
as many people as possible.
Dear Colleagues,
I am trying to determine how many Italian-speaking
evolutionary biologists are out there and where they are
(I am interested in contacting both Italian and foreign
nationals doing research in Italy, and Italians working
or studying outside of Italy), in order to see if there
is interest in the creation of an Italian Society of Evo-
lutionary Biology. During the last couple of years the
teaching of evolutionary theory in Italian schools has
come under attack from several political groups and
movements, and we presently do not have an organiza-
tion with elected representatives that can speak to the
public on behalf of Italian evolutionary biologists to re-
buke creationist attacks. All parties that are interested
in potentially joining a (yet to be established) Italian
Society of Evolutionary Biology, and eventually partici-
pating in activities organized by such an entity (annual
meetings, workshops, etc.) are warmly invited to please
join the list “Biologia Evoluzionistica” and participate
in a discussion about how to better organize ourselves.
Instructions on how to join the list are avail-
able at http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/-

John Maynard Smith Remembered
Dear Colleagues,
We are putting together a book of memories of the Late
and Great John Maynard Smith. We intend to put
these together into a bound volume to be presented to
John’s wife, Sheila. The book will be entitled ’John
Maynard Smith Remembered’.
This book will contain reminiscences, anecdotes, sto-
ries and recollections about JMS from his colleagues
and friends. The contents of the book will also be dis-
played on the Centre for the Study of Evolution (CSE)
website and a copy will be given to John’s Archivist.
We really would like you to make a contribution.
To submit your contribution:
Preferred method:
1. Go to the University of Sussex - CSE web-
site and use the online form for automatic submis-
sion. You will ﬁnd a link to the submission page
athttp://www.lifesci.susx.ac.uk/CSE/members/jms/-
jmsmemorial.htm 2. Send to me directly by email -
noel@sussex.ac.uk
Please remember to include a separate line that answers
the question “when and where did you know JMS”
(This is important for Sheila).
3. If you do not have access to a computer we will bedelighted to take hand-written recollections and process
them for you.
Send to
Noel Smith, The John Maynard Smith Building, Uni-
versity of Sussex, BN1 9QG, UK.
Leave extraction
Dear all,
I would appreciate any advice on high throughput DNA
extractions from dried leaves.
We have just taken delivery of a 96 well plate shaker-
grinder. When combined with the use of a plate spinner
this allows us the possibility of using the 96 well extrac-
tion kits for high throughput of samples. I have about
1000 silica gel-dried young leaves that I need to extract,
so a high-throughput system is clearly preferable!!
If anyone has experience of using a shaker-grinder
and/or 96 well kits with dried samples I will be glad
to hear of any tips/protocols or problems! I have found
that disrupting the dried leaves in liquid nitrogen rather
than directly in extraction buﬀer gives much better
DNA quality.
Many thanks in advance!

Silver staining
Fellow silver-stainers,
We’re visualising microsatellites by silver-staining de-
naturing polyacrylamide gels, following Bassam et al.
1991. Overnight the staining process has stopped work-
ing: at the developer stage there is no visible brown
stain whatsoever, not even along the top edge of the
gel, no matter how long the gel is left in the devel-
oper. We’ve been using this process for a few years and
have never had this kind of problem before. We’ve tried
changing reagents without success.Has anyone else encountered (and solved) this kind of
problem? Our next step is to try a diﬀerent water sup-
ply (pH is ﬁne though), but I thought I’d get some
advice from evoldir readers before running any more
gels. Please reply to <p.johnson@bio.gla.ac.uk >.

Simulation software
Hi,
I’m looking for software to simulate the eﬀect of se-
lection, mutation and/or migration in a Fisher-Wright
population. I want to follow the fate of a single gene
linked to several neutral markers, in addition to a poly-
genic eﬀect (many unlinked genes with small eﬀect).
I want to specify the number of generations since the
foundation of a population, the initial allele frequencies,
population size (constant over time), intensity of selec-
tion on the single gene, level of mutation at the gene
and markers and possible rate of immigration. I need
to recover phenotypes and genotypes at any speciﬁed
generation.

Software LAMARC 1 2 1
We have just released version 1.2.1 of the LAMARC
program (part of the LAMARC package).
LAMARC uses genetic data from a population to es-
timate several population parameters: size of sub-
populations, subpopulation growth rates, migration
rates among subpopulations, and overall recombination
rate. The algorithm is Metropolis-Hastings MCMC; we
search through a wide space of genealogies representing
the possible histories of the data.
Suitable data for this program includes DNA or RNA
sequences, SNPs, or microsatellites. Phase may be
known or (with some loss of power) unknown.
We had a brief and unsatisfactory release of version 1.2
several months ago, which is why this release is 1.2.1.
If you are one of the few people who obtained copies of
1.2, please replace them.
Version 1.2.1 adds:
Population growth and shrinkage. LAMARC can now
estimate population growth or shrinkage using an ex-
ponential model. In cases with population subdivision,
a separate growth rate is estimated for each subpopu-
lation.
GTR model for DNA, RNA and SNP data. LAMARC
can now use the General Time-Reversible model of nu-
cleotide sequence evolution. The best way to use this
feature is to estimate the GTR rates with a program
such as PAUP* and import them into LAMARC.Performance improvements. Maximization of the likeli-
hood surface is now faster and much more reliable, and
the program is faster overall. It has also been updated
to recent C++ standards and will compile correctly on
a wider variety of systems.
LAMARC is written in C++. We distribute source as
well as executables for Linux, Windows and MacOS. To
obtain the program or simply learn more about it, visit

doplatanus) which is a tetraploid species. I am using
nuclear microsatellite marker to study the genetic struc-
ture of above mentioned species. Since the species is
tetraploid I am getting 1 to 4 bands per locus per sam-
ple and to score alleles depending on dosage eﬀects is
not working (diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate alleles). I am get-
ting diﬃculties to interprate such types of bands. I
would be grateful if anyone can suggest me how to in-
terprate such types of bands and what types genetic
variation parameter can be estimated from such types
of data using which programme. Thank you in advance
for your help in this regard. Sincerely yours,

IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
The Computational Evolutionary Biology group (CEB)is a recent addition to the School of Computational
Science and Information Technology (CSIT; http://-
www.csit.fsu.edu ) at the Florida State University in
Tallahassee. CSIT is an interdisciplinary school focused
on computational applications in ﬁelds ranging from
mathematics to oceanography. The research focus of
CEB is in computational phylogenetics and population
genetics. A large portion of the computations in these
ﬁelds is currently performed by CEB software. CEB has
access to excellent computational resources, including
clusters and supercomputers.
CEB currently has four openings for postdocs with a
background in computer science, statistics and/or biol-
ogy:
Two computational phylogeneticists: one focused on
extending current Bayesian MCMC techniques for phy-
logenetic inference in an NIH-funded project; the other
for the development and implementation of improved
heuristic search methods for optimal trees and/or
Bayesian MCMC convergence diagnostics. More
info: Fredrik Ronquist, ronquist@csit.fsu.edu and Dave
Swoﬀord, swoﬀord@csit.fsu.edu.
One computational population geneticist to look at
the eﬀects of model violations in population genetics
inference using simulations. More info: Peter Beerli
beerli@csit.fsu.edu.
One coordinator of image database develop-
ment/comparative insect morphologist for a Tree
of Life project funded by NSF. The successful candi-
date will work with the phylogenetics of parasitic wasps
(Cynipoidea, Ceraphronoidea, and Proctotrupoidea):
collect morphological data, perform large-scale phylo-
genetic analyses, and coordinate the development of
a general-purpose image database (MorphBank) for
morphological phylogenetics and biodiversity research.
More info: Fredrik Ronquist, ronquist@csit.fsu.edu.
For the ﬁrst three positions, knowledge of a program-
ming language such as C, C++, or Java is essential.
The successful candidate should also be familiar with
probability theory and statistics and have a genuine in-
terest in biological problems. Algorithm development
and large-scale computations will be important com-
ponents of all three projects. For the last project, a
background in insect comparative morphology, SEM
imaging and phylogenetics is essential and familiarity
with image and biodiversity databasing on the web is
desirable. Applicants should submit CV, description of
research interests, and name and address of three refer-
ences. The appointments are for one year at a time up
to ﬁve years depending on the success of the candidate
and funding availability.July 1, 2004 EvolDir 37

UGlasgow cospeciation
Ancient mariners or recent stowaways?
A three year NERC postdoc is available in Rod Page’s
lab to in Glasgow study seabird-louse cospeciation in
multiple clades of seabirds. The provisional start date
is October 1, 2004. The aims of the research are:
1. To establish robust phylogenies for lice from three
diﬀerent seabird orders. 2. To measure the relative
frequency of cospeciation, host switching, and other
events in the evolution of seabird lice. 3. To determine
whether multispecies louse assemblages have evolved in
situ on the host, or whether they are the result of inde-
pendent colonisations. 4. To determine which (if any)
host attributes are correlated with louse diversiﬁcation
and degree of cospeciation. 5. To assess the eﬀect of
host phylogeny shape on the degree of cospeciation be-
tween seabirds and their lice.
Full details of the project can be found at http://-

ULausanne HumanFuncGenomics
POSTDOC POSITION: EVOLUTIONARY FUNC-
TIONAL GENOMICS OF HUMANS
A Postdoc position is available immediately in the
group of Henrik Kaessmann at the recently founded
Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lau-
sanne, Switzerland.
Currently we focus on the origin and evolution of pri-
mate genes and gene structures. New genes origi-
nate through various molecular mechanisms such as
the classic mechanisms of gene duplication (e.g. tan-
dem gene duplication), gene copying by retroposition,
exon/domain shuﬄing, and gene fusion. We pursue
several projects that aim to shed light on the rela-
tive importance of these mechanisms in generating pri-
mate genes. We are particularly interested in char-
acterizing the (adaptive) evolution of young genes in
the human genome that originated recently on the pri-
mate lineage and therefore may be relevant in regard
to human/hominoid-speciﬁc phenotypes. To this end,
we explore available data from genomic databases and
generate complementary data by experimental analysis.
For more information on the group and our institute
more generally, see the website: http://www.unil.ch/-44 EvolDir July 1, 2004
cigFor this position, I am seeking highly qualiﬁed and
motivated applicants with a strong interest in human
genome evolution, who have strong experimental lab
skills, because we want to characterize functional adap-
tive changes of newly emerged genes. Thus, dedicated
biochemists or molecular biologists with an evolution-
ary interest are encouraged to apply as well.
The position is available for two years, with possible
extensions. The salary is approximately 45,000 Euros
per year.
The language of the institute is English, and its mem-
bers form an international group that is rapidly expand-
ing. The institute is in Lausanne, a beautiful city at
Lake Geneva amidst an impressive alpine scenery.
Informal inquiries may be addressed to: Hen-

UMaryland BehEvolGenetics
Postdoctoral position in behavioral evolutionary genet-
ics and speciation P.I.’s : Drs. Kerry Shaw and Patrick
Danley, Department of Biology, University of Mary-
land, College Park, MD
Research Project: A postdoctoral position is available
to join an NSF-funded project to examine the genetic
basis of naturally occurring variation in courtship be-
havior among closely related species of the Hawaiian
cricket genus Laupala. While ecologically and morpho-
logically similar, species are easily distinguished by the
pulse rates of the male calling song. Male pulse rate has
been implicated in mate recognition and the evolution
of this behavioral character is thought to have played
a large role in the rapid and extensive diversiﬁcation
of this genus. Two focal species, L. paranigra and L.
kohalensis, show large diﬀerences in the pulse rate of
the male calling song and associated female preference,
while a third species, L. pruna, sings at an interme-
diate value. Biometrical and quantitative genetic loci
mapping in the focal species indicates that male song is
under the genetic control of many loci. We seek to com-
plement these approaches by examining the patterns of
gene expression in a large number of genes expressed in
the cricket ventral nerve cord via microarray analysis.
The rhythmic singing behavior in crickets has been lo-
calized to a speciﬁc tissue and the development of the
rhythmic neuromuscular behavior that generates song
has been shown to lie within a speciﬁc developmental
window. We are probing the link between gene expres-
sion and the development of this naturally occurring
behavior. The successful candidate would be expected
to contribute to this collaborative project while forging
an independent research direction. A comparative phy-
logenetic framework also exists in which to understand
behavioral evolution in this genus. Laupala represents a
portion of a larger radiation of endemic Hawaiian trigo-nidiine crickets that is conspicuously characterized by
frequent speciation and acoustic signaling evolution. In
Laupala, DNA data suggest that the current radiation
began on the oldest island where the genus is presently
found (Kauai, 5 mya), and radiated into younger is-
land habitats as those islands appeared within the last
5 million years. These data also show that speciation
has occurred both within and between islands and that
species ranges are limited to single islands. Commu-
nities of Laupala occur on all the major Hawaiian Is-
lands and convergent patterns of song evolution among
islands, and displaced evolutionary patterns within is-
lands are evident. The three focal species of this study
are each endemic to the Big Island of Hawaii and are
very closely related. This phylogenetic structure pro-
vides a recent evolutionary context in which to study
the evolution of genes and behavior.
Requirements: The desired candidate will possess an
interest in / experience with a number of bench skills
(such as DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, cDNA synthesis,
cloning). An interest in the neurological basis of behav-
ior and/or the evolution of premating isolation would
be beneﬁcial but no prior knowledge is required.
The University of Maryland’s Department of Biology
has several labs dedicated to the study of both specia-
tion genetics, neuroethology and evolutionary develop-
mental biology. As such, it provides a rich academic
environment for those interested in proximate and ulti-
mate causes of behavioral development, evolution and
speciation.
The position can be ﬁlled immediately and two years
of funding are available. To apply, email a state-
ment of research interests, a curriculum vitae, and
the email addresses of three references to Kerry Shaw

Lyon PopGenet June24-25TOP OF MESSAGE: Dear Evoldir, an international
workshop called “Computational linguistics methods &
Population Genetics” will soon be held in Lyon (France)
the 24 and 25 June 2004 (next week).
Invited speakers: Peter Forster (McDonald Institute for
Archeological Research - Cambridge UK); Russel Gray
(University of Auckland - New Zealand); Hans Goebl
(University of Salzburg - Austria); Wilbert Heeringa
(University of Groningen - The Netherlands); Paul Heg-
garty (University of Sheﬃeld - UK); Robert McMahon
(University of Sheﬃeld - UK); John Nerbonne (Univer-
sity of Groningen - The Netherlands).
Aims: The aim of this workshop is to focus on the
possible ways to investigate linguistic variability using
computational methods inspired from population ge-
netics and phylogenetics. Several such methods have
already been developed in a dialectometric frame, but
hardly permeate historical linguistics. The discussion
will be restricted to regional scales and to the anal-
ysis of similar languages. Clear methodological par-
allelism can be established between population genet-
ics approaches and linguistic issues. Recently, some of
these, median joining network and string alignment for
instance, have been introduced in linguistics, but their
application is mainly restricted to dialectology. The
linguistic community often considers these approaches
as heretic, the main stumbling block being the reduc-
tionism imposed on the linguistic data to ﬁt models de-
veloped for molecular data. To perfect these methodsJuly 1, 2004 EvolDir 49
and make them gain acceptance among linguists, some
fundamental questions must be answered convincingly:
Can these methods also be applied to close languages?
How close should these languages be? Are the results
reliable? How can this reliability be tested?
Unfortunately, there is no time for other presentations
so, please, do not submit abstracts.

Presented under the auspices of the Special Focus on
Computational Molecular Biology.Announcing a workshop on reticulate evolution to be
held September 20-21, 2004 Registration details and
further information for the workshop may be obtained
from the website
http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Reticulated
Brief description of the goals of the workshop: Species
evolution has long been modeled as a branching
process that can uniquely be represented by a tree
topology. In such a topology, each species can only
be linked to its closest ancestor, while interspecies
relationships such as species hybridization or lateral
gene transfer in bacteria are not allowed. With the
advent of phylogenetic analysis at the molecular level,
there is increasing evidence that such a model is
inadequate. This workshop will explore the history
and latest status of these new models of “reticulate
evolution”, and will be coupled with a smaller working
group meeting designed to explore promising avenues
for future research.
The organizers welcome contributed papers that are in
the spirit of the above announcement. Abstracts may
be submitted to any of the organizers no later than Au-
gust 1, 2004. Any submissions must be approved by the
organizers.

UFribourg ExpEvol Oct4-5
Experimental Evolution Workshop 4-5 October 2004
Fribourg Ecology & Evolution Days 2004
Workshop location: University of Fribourg, Departe-
ment of Biology, Fribourg, Switzerland.
When does natural selection favor the evolution of eco-
logical specialization as opposed to a generalist lifestyle,
and why? Does conﬂict between the sexes lead to an
evolutionary arms-race? What factors aﬀect the evo-
lution of parasite virulence? Is mutation rate molded
by evolution? Is evolution repeatable and reversible?
Studying evolution in real time under experimental con-
ditions is a powerful way of addressing these questions.
This workshop will bring together several invited speak-ers and a number of younger researchers using exper-
imental evolution to address diverse questions. The
talks will be followed by plenary discussion. The sym-
posium will be free (no registration fee).
Conﬁrmed invited speakers: * James B. Anderson (Uni-
versity of Toronto, Canada) * Graham Bell (McGill
University, Montreal, Canada) * Angus Buckling (Uni-
versity of Bath, UK) * Santiago Elena (University of
Valencia, Spain) * William Rice (University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Barbara, USA) * Gregory Velicer (Max-
Planck Institute of Developmental Biology, T¨ ubingen,
Germany)
We have time for about 15 contributed talks of 20 min-
utes.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject52 EvolDir July 1, 2004
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
