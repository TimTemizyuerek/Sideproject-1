Dear colleague,
On April 1st 2010, the Royal Netherlands Academy of
Arts and Sciences (KNAW) hosts a full day symposium
on Evolutionary Medicine. It gives a excellent overview
of current research in evolutionary medicine and hu-
man evolutionary genetics in the Netherlands. For
more information, location, and the program, please
see: http://www.healthy-ageing.nl/UserFiles/ﬁle/-
KNAW Evolutionary Medicine FinalInvitation.pdf
Admission if free but please register by email at
a.peters@aig.umcn.nl
“The role of evolution in health and disease is a rela-
tively neglected area of research. In daily practice of
clinical medicine virtual no attention is paid to the no-
tion that modern human disease often has an important
evolutionary component. This symposium is meant toexplore the eﬀects of evolution on human health and
will attempt to bring together the available informa-
tion from diﬀerent disciplines.”

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
Objectives Systematic biology faces tremendous chal-
lenges and opportunities at the present time. This
conference aims at providing an opportunity for plant
systematists and evolutionary biologists to review the
progress, evaluate the current status, and look into the
future of the ﬁeld. China hosts enormous plant diver-
sity that has supported its long history and continuous
advancement in studying plant systematics. With espe-
cially rapid progress made during the recent years, 2010
comes to be the time for China to invite colleagues from
the world to discuss the new frontiers of systematic bi-
ology. This would provide an ideal forum for Chinese
and international colleagues to present research results,
exchange ideas, discuss common interests, develop col-
laborations, stimulate young students, and move the
ﬁeld of systematic biology forward. The conference will
include talks, posters, and open discussions on recent
progress and future directions of the following areas: 1)
Taxonomy, collections, and databases; 2) Phylogenet-
ics, phylogenomics, and the Tree of Life; 3) Biogeogra-
phy and phylogeography; 4) Speciation, hybridization,
and adaptation; 5) Molecular evolution, evolutionary
genetics and genomics, and Evo-Devo.
Organizers Botanical Society of China (BSC) Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) International Association
for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT)
Conference Venue The conference will be held at the Xi-
angshan Jinyuan Hotel. This ﬁve-star hotel is located
in the southeast foot of the Fragrant Hill (Xiangshan),
one of Beijing’s most famous scenic and historical sites.
It stands near the precious royal garden with 800 years
of history, beautiful landscapes, and elegant environ-
ment. The hotel is within walking distance to the Bei-
jing Botanical Garden and the Institute of Botany, the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.

ANNUAL MEETING, PhD Students Evolutionary Bi-
ology
The annual meeting of the study group evolutionary
biology of the German zoological society (DZG) is a
unique opportunity for graduate students (Diploma,
Master, PhD) in evolutionary biology to present their
projects and to get to know each other both on a scien-
tiﬁc as well as on a personal level. This year´ ıs meeting
will be held in Freiburg im Breisgau from the 16th to
the 18th of April 2010 and is organised by the groups
of PD Dr. Martin Schaefer and Dr. Thomas Schmitt.*
*We encourage all Diploma, Master and PhD students,
who are interested in any aspect of evolutionary biology
to join the meeting. Traditionally, the meeting is orga-
nized by the DZG (German Zoological Society), but
botanists, mycologists, microbiologists and theoretical
biologists are equally welcome. The meeting will pro-
vide an optimal opportunity to give a talk about your
Diploma, Master or PhD thesis. In addition to that, it
is a great way to ﬁnd out what other fellow evolution-
ary biologists are working on, and perhaps to ﬁnd out
where you would like to do your PhD or Postdoc.
Invited speakers:
- Prof. Dr. Ole Seehausen; Univ. of Bern & EAWAG

>From genome to phenotype. Quantitative genetics
aims to link phenotypic variation for complex traits to
its underlying genetic basis in order to better under-
stand and predict genetic architecture and long term
change within natural, agricultural, and human popula-
tions. Traditionally built upon statistical abstractions
of genetic eﬀects, the ﬁeld is now rapidly advancing
by making use of recent exciting developments in ge-
netic and genomic technologies to reveal explicit links
between genes and complex phenotypes, and there-
fore serves as a focal point for bringing together many
emerging areas of genetics, genomics, physiology, statis-
tics, bioinformatics, and computational biology. This
synthesis is already having a large impact on the areas
of evolutionary biology, plant and animal breeding, and
the genetic analysis of human disease.
The strength of the Gordon Conference on “Quanti-
tative Genetics & Genomics” has historically been the
bringing together of leaders in each of these ﬁelds to
explore and exchange areas of shared interest and cut-
ting edge developments, with the potential to impact
all researchers within the broad ﬁeld of quantitative
genetics. Building upon the tremendous success of our
conferences in recent years, we will again focus on many
cutting-edge developments in the ﬁeld, including whole
genome approaches to understanding and exploiting ge-8 EvolDir April 1, 2010
netic variation, the use of next generation sequence data
to identify causal genes and pathways, genome architec-
ture and regulation, systems genetics, non-traditional
forms of inheritance, and statistical genetics.

MAKER and demonstrate both the command line ver-
sion and the new online MAKER Web Annotation Ser-
vice (MWAS). MAKER is a portable and easily con-
ﬁgurable genome annotation pipeline. Its purpose is
to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome
projects to independently annotate their genomes and
create genome databases. MAKER identiﬁes repeats,
aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab ini-
tio gene predictions and automatically synthesizes these
data into gene annotations having evidence-based qual-
ity values. Several use-case scenarios with example data
and results will also be presented.
FUNDING AGENCY PRESENTATIONS: Representa-
tives from national funding agencies will make short
presentations about funding philosophies and opportu-
nities within their programs. Following each presenta-
tion, the ﬂoor will be open for questions and discussion.

Dear all,
The deadline for the submission of oral contributions
and posters to the FSD2010 conference and for the reg-
istration at normal fee is coming soon (March 14, 2010).
The FSD2010 meeting will take place from the 13th to
the 18th of June 2010 at the Congress Center, Corum in
Montpellier, France ( http://www.fsd2010.org ). This is
the 5th International Symposium / Workshop on seed
dispersal after those held in Mexico (1985-1990), Brazil
(2000) and Australia (2005). It is therefore a major sci-
entiﬁc event regarding the role and the importance of
seed dispersal by animals or other modes of abiotic dis-
semination on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
The aim of this scientiﬁc event is to facilitate inter-
actions and discussions between ecologists around the
world interested in seed dispersal at large.
Please visit our website ( www.fsd2010.org ) for the up-
dated program and any other additional information.

ics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http:/-
/ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/ 2010. See below
for instructions.
Accepted talks will be about 15-20 minutes in length
and will be presented during the full talk sessions in
the morning of each of the two conference days, follow-
ing the day’s keynote presentation.
Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics
aimed at advancing research in phylogenetics, evolu-
tion, and biodiversity, including new tools, cyberinfras-
tructure development, large-scale data analysis, and vi-
sualization.
Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most12 EvolDir April 1, 2010
1 page long. The abstract should provide an overview
of the talk’s subject. As the number of program slots
for full talks is limited, the abstract should give enough
detail so reviewers can decide whether the submission
merits a full talk or whether it should be moved to one
of the lightning talk sessions. If the subject of the talk
is a speciﬁc software for use by the research commu-
nity, the abstract must state the license and give the
URL where the source code is available so reviewers
can verify that the open-source requirement(*) is met.
The deadline for submission is April 8, 2010. We in-
tend to notify authors of accepted talks before early
registration for iEvoBio (and Evolution) ends. Fur-
ther instructions for submission are at the follow-
ing URL: http://ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/-
2010/information/presenters Full talks are 1 of 5 kinds
of contributed content that iEvoBio will feature. The
other 4 are: 1) Lightning talks (5 mins long), 2) Chal-
lenge entries, 3) Software bazaar demonstrations, and
4) Birds-of- a-Feather gatherings. The Call for Chal-
lenge entries is already open (see http://ievobio.org/-
challenge.html ), and information on how to contribute
to the other 3 sessions is forthcoming.

Dear All,
This year, the “Ecology & Behaviour” Meeting, orga-
nized by the SERL association, takes place in Tours,
from Monday 12 to Friday 16 April 2010.
This is an international meeting with the main pur-
pose of promoting postgraduate research and interac-
tions between young researchers in Behavioural Ecol-
ogy. The one speciﬁcity of this meeting, which is orga-
nized by the SERL PhD students association, is that
it is free for all participants: you only have to pay for
your trip to Tours.
This year, the “Ecology & Behaviour” Meeting consists
of four days of conferences divided into six themes:
- Sexual Selection - Foraging Strategies/ Parasitism -
Habitat selection/ Dispersion - Group / Individual in-
teractions - Neuro-ethology / Ecophysiology - Evolu-
tionary Biology / Conservation/ Applied Research
Each session will be introduced by two invited profes-
sors specialized in this ﬁeld of research, followed by 8-10
postgraduate student research presentations and dis-
cussions. In addition, poster sessions and three “theme
evenings” designed for a broad public are planned. Par-
ticipants are expected to give a 15-minute talk. In order
to register please submit the abstract of your talk (or
poster) (250 words maximum) on the website: http:/-/serl2010.univ-tours.fr (see the website for supplemen-
tary information). Registration are opened until 5nd
March 2010.
Hope to see you in April,

Immunopathology & Immunosenescence: an evolution-
ary perspective
A one day symposium,
April 28, 2010
University of Edinburgh
Ashworth Laboratories, Lecture Theatre III
Kings Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh
Organisers: Dan Nussey (dan.nussey@ed.ac.uk) & Tom
Little (tom.little@ed.ac.uk)
Hosted by The Centre for Immunity, Infection and
Evolution (CIIE; http://ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/ ), a Wellcome
Trust-funded initiative to connect evolutionary biology
to infection research and gain an interdisciplinary per-
spective on challenges to global health.
Symposium remit: the study of disease has often been
separated from the study of ’normal’ or ’healthy’ age-
ing, but it is now clear that immunopathology and im-
munosenescence play an integral role in the process of
aging. Evolutionary theory provides a unifying frame-
work from which to understand variation in the ageing
process, but this has not been as widely applied as it
might be. This symposium brings together researchers
from a range of disciplines with the aim of integrat-
ing evolutionary, immunological and epidemiological
thinking on the causes of variation in immunopathol-
ogy and immunosenescence amongst individuals, pop-
ulations and species.

“Frontiers of Multidisciplinary Research: Mathematics,
Engineering and Biology” to be held at the University
of Exeter, 21-24 September 2010.“Frontiers of Multidisciplinary Research” is designed to
foster interdisciplinary thinking without deﬁning any a
priori scientiﬁc boundaries. The meeting will bring to-
gether scientists who would normally not attend the
same conferences and facilitate their interaction. This
will be achieved by a list of carefully selected invited
speakers:
Ralf Sommer, MPI Tubingen |Sebastian Bonhoeﬀer,
ETH|Andreas Wagner, Uni Zurich |Uwe Sauer, ETH
|Mark Isalan, CRG-Barcelona Luca Cardelli, Microsoft

PhD Student Position in Theoretical Ecology
A PhD student position in theoretical ecology is avail-
able in the Department of Mathematics Informatics &
Physics at the AgroParisTech, Paris, France ( http://-
www.agroparistech.fr/-English-version-.html ).
The aim of the project is to model the topology of eco-
logical networks with the last developments of statisti-
cal models for heterogeneous random graphs. During
the ﬁrst year of the project, the candidate will review
the clustering algorithms and mixtures models aimed
at identifying modules in graphs. He will deﬁne the
most appropriate methods for studying ecological net-
works. During the second year of the project, he will
use the selected methods to elucidate the topology of a
host-parasite interaction network (tree-parasitic fungus
network). The impacts of (1) the nature of data (binary
versus quantitative) (2) the spatial and temporal scales
of sampling and (3) the integration of other interaction
types (tree-phytophageous insects) on the modularity
of the network will be studied. During the third year of
the project, the candidate will get an insight into the
impact of climate change on the topology of the net-
work through the statistical analysis of the data arising
from a metagenomic experiment.
The position is funded for three years by the French
National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA,
http://www.international.inra.fr/ ). The ideal startingdate would be in September 2010. The successful
candidate may follow the international interdisci-
plinary PhD program of the FdV graduate school

Title Genetic processes underlying species coexistence
in tropical rain forests: is competition intensity shaped
by genetic relatedness?
Start Date probably July 2010
Project This project seeks to explore diﬀerences among
tree species in gene ﬂow (by pollen and seed disper-
sal) in relation to patterns of tree distribution, and the
further implications of diﬀerential gene ﬂow and seed
dispersal for seedling competition in the lowland rain-
forests of Malaysian Borneo. Ultimately, the research
aims to contribute to an understanding of the mech-
anisms that maintain tree species diversity in tropical
forests.
The project combines population biology, experimental
ecology and molecular ecology.
Collaborators This research will be conducted in col-
laboration with the Sepilok Forest Research Centre in
Sabah, Malaysia, and the University of Aberdeen, UK.
Relevance Aside from the scientiﬁc interest, the outputs

A grant for a Ph.D. thesis, followed by a two-years post-

the evolutionary bases of adaptation of Neotropical
rainforest trees to their environment. More information

http://www.rp2e.inpl-nancy.fr/index.php?id=5 In-
terviews will be held in Nancy in June 2010. Please
contact the Lab leaders for more details on the research
topic:
Forest tree species are dominant components (in terms
of biomass and as ecological drivers) of one of the most
diverse ecosystems, the tropical rainforest. Their envi-
ronmental adaptations, and their potential to face cli-
matic changes, determine both the structure of these
ecological communities and their fate under global
change.
The diversity of the response of tropical trees to
their environment is being elucidated, and in partic-
ular, it has been found that several genera harbor
species that diﬀerentiate along the water availability
axis (drought/ﬂooding) (Baraloto et al., 2007). It
has also been shown that closely related species, with
slightly diﬀerent ecological properties, can be diﬀeren-
tiated by genetic markers (Duminil et al., 2006). Re-
cently, sequences of genes involved in plant water bal-
ance (aquaporins) have been isolated in a set of tropi-
cal tree genera (Audigeos et al., submitted; Brousseau
2009; Scotti 2009a) at UMR EcoFoG and a large-scale
greenhouse experiment, with 2000 seedlings from eigh-
teen half-sib families of Eperua falcata, is under way in
the same research centre, with the goal of evaluating
genetic and environmental components of responses to
water stresses (Scotti 2009b). The existence of a rele-
vant genetic component of quantitative trait diversity
in rainforest tree populations has been recently proven
(Scotti et al. 2010). These preliminary data set the
conditions for addressing the question of the under-
standing of ecophysiological and genetic mechanisms of
the adaptation of trees to their environment in natural
conditions. The hypothesis to test is that trees grow-ing in diﬀerent conditions show diﬀerential adaptation
to their respective environments, and that both physi-
ological adjustments and genetic adaptation contribute
to this behaviour. In particular, the Ph.D. student will
be proposed to:
- build a genetic linkage map and identify the genetic
basis of quantitative traits based on the greenhouse ex-
periment and data by using AFLP and gene-based (Au-
digeos et al. submitted; Brousseau 2009) markers
- setup a reciprocal transplant experiment in natural
conditions, with half-sib families of species of the genus
Eperua, with the aim of evaluating genetic and envi-
ronmental components of environmental adaptations,
as well as phenotypic plasticity and genotype ×envi-
ronment interactions; analyse the ecophysiological and
growth traits of the transplanted seedlings and identify
the genetic components of diﬀerences among sites and
among environments, and compare the results obtained
across genera.
- validate the genetic bases, identiﬁed in (a), based
on quantitative data obtained in (b), by genotyping
seedlings grown in reciprocal transplants with mark-
ers that have shown correlation with the traits, and
by validating the correlation in the natural setting of
reciprocal transplants.

Life in French Guiana
Scientiﬁc life is very active at the EcoFoG research cen-
tre in Kourou, French Guiana, with weekly seminars,
journal clubs and training courses. Lab equipments are
standard international level in genetics and plant phys-
iology. The climate is hot and humid, but largely mit-
igated by trade winds on the coast (where Kourou is
located), with alternating rainy and dry seasons. The
main asset for leisure time in French Guiana is its out-
standing natural setting (the tropical rainforest); the
Carnival in French Guiana is also unique. Everyday
life can be expensive, in particular for housing and im-
port goods. A vehicle is generally necessary for travel
between towns. Life is generally laid back, although
with occasional insecurity problems.

KULeuven Belgium Cichlid
parasites
Dear Evoldir members,
4 YEAR PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
A 4 year PhD position for an evolutionary biologist is
immediately vacant at the Laboratory of Animal Diver-
sity and Systematics (Katholieke Universiteit Leuvenand the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren,
Belgium) in the research group of Prof. Filip Volck-
aert to study micro-evolutionary responses in Lake Tan-
ganyika cichlids.
Description: The project investigates the role of par-
asitism and immunogenetic adaptation in the diversi-
ﬁcation of Lake Tanganyika cichlids. Parasites may
play an important role in cichlid adaptive radiation
as they may inﬂuence both naturally and sexually se-
lected traits, speeding up the evolution of reproductive
isolation. Field studies, mate-choice experiments and
molecular work will be carried out to investigate par-
asite community structure, mating isolation, the po-
tential role of parasites in mate choice, and local im-
munogenetic adaptation (MHC). The comparison be-
tween cichlid species showing extreme versus no chro-
matic diﬀerentiation will clarify whether parasites, im-
munogenetic adaptation and colour polymorphism have
a synergistic eﬀect in cichlid mate choice. Evolution
of cichlids and their parasites has been studied in our
team over the past 3 years, while the Royal Museum
for Central Africa is a world expert in cichlid system-
atics (see http://bio.kuleuven.be/de/dev/pubs.php for
publications). The project starts on 01/04/2010 and
is supervised by prof. Filip Volckaert and dr. Joost
Raeymaekers.
The team: The Laboratory of Animal Diversity and
Systematics has a strong expertise in neutral and adap-
tive evolution of ﬁshes and their parasites, includ-
ing ﬁeld monitoring, experimental design, medium-
throughput genotyping, the analysis of genetic, ge-
nomic, and phenotypic data with up-to-date statisti-
cal approaches. Topics addressed include phylogeny,
barcoding, phylogeography, population genetics, local
adaptation and rapid evolution (natural and ﬁsheries
induced), enhanced selection in aquaculture (aquacul-
ture genomics), co-evolution between host and parasite,
spatio-temporal dynamics of nursery grounds and the
management of aquatic habitats. Our team comprises
6 PhD students, 4 postdocs, 2 technicians and a team
leader. The historic KULeuven, founded in 1425, has
a very stimulating research environment. The modern
city of Leuven with its medieval roots oﬀers a high qual-
ity of life.
Proﬁle: High motivation, background in evolutionary
biology, interest or experience in ﬁeld based experimen-
tal research is strongly recommended. Research will
be carried out in collaboration with a multidisciplinary
team specialised in evolutionary biology, molecular par-
asitology and population genomics. Mate choice exper-
iments will be carried out at the University of Graz
(Prof. C. Sturmbauer).22 EvolDir April 1, 2010
Financing: The successful candidate is funded by a
national project (Research Fund - Flanders; salary of
approximately 1700 /month net). The candidate is ex-
pected to apply for a national Research Fund - Flanders
or IWT fellowship.

Genetics/Genomics of edge populations in a northward
moving damselﬂy
GENERAL THEME: The PhD project is embedded in
a larger research program where we compare the evo-
lutionary ecology of edge and central populations in
damselﬂy species that are expanding their range north-
wards and thereby shed light on the consequences for lo-
cal ecological interactions and the potential for further
range expansion. We are documenting how edge popu-
lations diﬀer in a number of ecologically-relevant traits.
To understand phenotypic diﬀerentiation in these traits
we are quantifying associated selection pressures and
patterns of divergence at neutral and quantitative ge-
netic traits, as well as functional genetic/genomic vari-

CrypticDiversity
M.Sc. Position at Laurentian University, Ontario
Cryptic Genetic Diversity in Hyalella azteca.
A graduate student position is available at Laurentian
University to examine genetic diversity and possible
cryptic speciation in benthic invertebrates.
Freshwater benthic invertebrates generally have a rel-
atively short reproduction time that, combined with aApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 23
spectrum of selective pressures across varying habitats,
make them strong candidates for diversiﬁcation. Previ-
ous research using DNA barcoding suggests that a com-
mon species ±of amiphipod may actually be 30 or more
provisional species. The Greater Sudbury area water-
shed presents varying levels of heavy metal contami-
nation possibly resulting in local adaptation or species
diﬀerentiation. Previous work suggested that there are
possibly two or more co-occurring species within this
region possibly resulting from both isolation and habi-
tat specialization. This isolation may predate the local
contamination, but the contamination may be exagger-
ating the eﬀects of longer term separation.
We are looking for an M.Sc. candidate to explore the
possibility of cryptic amphipod species and the poten-
tial environmental causes of this speciation process.
The student will work in the context of evolutionary
ecology combining ﬁeld work and possibly experimen-
tal studies depending on his/her interests. Good ap-
titude for ﬁeldwork, molecular ecology skills and espe-
cially population genetics basics are expected as well as
good communication skills.
Starting date: Candidates are expected to commence
their studies in June 2010.
Full funding of approximately $15,000/year is guaran-
teed for 2 years. Additional scholarships will be avail-
able by competition.
How to apply: Interested students should contact Dr.
David Lesbarrres (dlesbarreres@laurentian.ca) or Dr.
Thomas Merritt (TMerritt@laurentian.ca), including a
cover letter describing background and interests (in-
cluding speciﬁc interests in this research project), cv,
transcripts (unoﬃcial is accepted).

Dear all, here is a PhD proposal in the DIMAR lab-
oratory in Marseille (France; http://www.com.univ-
mrs.fr/DIMAR/ )
PhD proposal: The DIMAR laboratory in Marseille of-
fers a phD opportunity funded by the CNRS. This is a
3 years contract, which will start on october 2010. The
PhD student will study the genetic consequences of past
and present environmental changes on Mediterranean
gorgonians (red coral, Corallium rubrum, and the red
gorgonian Paramuricea clavata). The impact of past
environmental ﬂuctuations will be analysed by a com-
pared study of the sequence diversity of several nuclear
markers. The putative consequences of on going cli-
mate change will be studied by estimating the levels of
expression of some candidate genes in experimental and
natural conditions. This will be used in order to analyse
the adaptation (sensu lato) of these organisms to some
environment variable in space and time. This project
will take advantage of several previous advances: - the
development of some nuclear markers (introns) - the iso-
lation of some candidate genes and the development of
real-time PCR protocols - a 454 sequencing of the tran-
scriptome for one of the model species - a microsatellite
analysis of the genetic structure of these organisms.
Some skills in gene expression studies or sequence anal-
ysis are required. A good level in diving may be an
advantage.

MaxPlanck Leipzig
ComputationalEvolutionaryBio- PhD position in computational/evolutionary biology
-
There is an opening (fall 2010) for a student with a
strong academic background to pursue a PhD in our
research group at the Max Planck Institute for Evo-
lutionary Anthropology (Department of Evolutionary
Genetics). One main aim in the laboratory is the char-
acterization of genes whose protein functions require
the trace element selenium. These genes incorporate
selenium in the form of selenocysteine, the 21st amino
acid in the genetic code, and are known as selenoprotein
genes. Building on our expertise in the computational
identiﬁcation and annotation of selenoprotein genes in
eukaryotic genomes, the student will apply population
genetics/molecular approaches to study their evolution.
We will focus on understanding the genetic basis of
adaptations in selenoprotein gene regulation to levels of
dietary selenium in primates. Re-sequencing and com-
parative expression experiments will be used. Ample
opportunities for the analysis of primate genomes in
collaboration with other groups in the Department will
exist.
We are seeking a motivated, well-organized and creative
person. Previous research experience is an advantage.
The student will receive a payment according to Max
Planck Institute rates. The working environment of the
institute is English-speaking, and the members consti-
tute a highly international group. The institute is in
Leipzig, a pleasant city of 500,000 inhabitants situated
two hours from Berlin and three hours from Prague.
Applicants should send their CV, transcripts and name
and address of two references (in PDF format) to Dr.

HumanPopulationGenetics
PhD position in human population genetics
A PhD position is available in the genetic anthropology
and human ecology team (UMR 7206) in Paris, France.
This lab is part of the Centre National de la Recherche
Scientiﬁque (CNRS) and the National Museum of Nat-
ural History (MNHN).
In humans, evolution is not only biological but also
cultural. Social organization is a key factor inﬂuenc-
ing gene transmission to the next generation and gene
dispersion within and among populations. Ethnolo-
gists have described the impressive complexity of so-
cial organizations in human populations, and in par-
ticular the complex rules of alliance (which determine
mate choice), rules of descent (which aﬃliate individu-
als to kin groups), and rules of residence (which indi-
cate where married couples settle down). In this con-
text, this PhD project aims at better understanding
the impact of kinship systems on the genetic evolution
of human populations. It is part of a four years ANR
funded research program (2009-2013).
In this PhD project, multidisciplinary models of gene
pool evolution under diﬀerent types of social organiza-
tions will be developed. Special attention will be given
to matrilineal, patrilineal and cognatic social organi-
zations with diﬀerent level of exogamy and diﬀerent
residence rules. Individual-based simulations will be
performed in order to implement complex models of
alliance, descent and residence rules. This will allow
investigating the patterns of genetic diversity (neutraland counter-selected) expected under diﬀerent kinds of
social organizations.
Then, the outcome of these simulations will be com-
pared to genome-wide genetic patterns observed in
South-East Asian populations presenting a wide range
of social organizations. When appropriate, social or-
ganization parameters (such as kin group extinction
rate or migration rates of men and women between
kin groups) will be estimated. The complexity of the
envisioned model in terms of social, demographic and
genetic parameters will be circumvented by the use of
ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation). This ap-
proach may also help detecting populations having ex-
perienced a recent transition in their social organiza-
tion.
This position is funded for three years by the Ecole doc-
torale Diversit´ e du Vivant ( http://eddv.snv.jussieu.fr/ )
and starts in September 2010. Applicants should have
a Master degree in population genetics, ecology or evo-
lution and a strong interest for theoretical approaches.
Applications should include a description of research
interests, a complete CV and the names and email
addresses of 2 professional references. Applications
should be sent by email before the 18th of April 2010
to the supervisors, Pr Evelyne Heyer (heyer@mnhn.fr),

The department of Marine Ecology, which studies the
structure and functioning of marine foodwebs, has a
vacancy for a PhD student
“Ecological eﬀects of predation by intertidal shorebirds
on marine benthic communities”26 EvolDir April 1, 2010
In the current biodiversity decline, predators are of-
ten the ﬁrst to disappear. Predators are thought to
play a positive role in biodiversity maintenance as they
prevent certain prey species in achieving dominance,
relaxing resource competition among prey, hence pro-
moting prey growth rates, prey coexistence and diver-
sity. Losses of species at the highest trophic levels
in communities may therefore cause extinctions and
shifts in size structure at lower trophic levels. How-
ever, this role of predators is still often underappre-
ciated, largely because many ecosystems have already
lost their top-predators and/or human-induced distur-
bances now blur the positive predation eﬀects. Further-
more, the role of migrant predators structuring com-
munities along their migratory route has mostly been
neglected.
For this reason, this project explores the eﬀects of pre-
dation in one of the most pristine and undisturbed in-
tertidal ecosystems in the world, the Banc d’Arguin
(Mauritania, West Africa). Here we will study the
structuring role of molluscivore shorebirds, notably the
red knot (Calidris canutus), on the intertidal benthic
community. The decline of wintering population of
knots at Banc d’Arguin (due to habitat-destruction
elsewhere along the ﬂyway) coincides with an increase
in the knot’s main prey species and a decline in overall
mollusc diversity. Taking an experimental approach,
we will explore whether these are causal relationships.
For example, by excluding knots from small-scale study
plots, the PhD-student will focus on how prey competi-
tion and species coexistence are aﬀected by predation.
Modelling tools will be employed in order to explore the
consequences at the ecosystem level.
REQUIREMENTS
We are looking for an enthusiastic young biologist inter-
ested in scaling-up from behavior to community ecol-
ogy, both empirically but also theoretically. The can-
didate should be able to cope with the primitive and
sometimes harsh ﬁeld conditions when working in Mau-
ritania. Aﬃnity with birds is not a requirement, and
neither is a command of French, but both will be seen as
assets. The assignment should lead to the completion
of a PhD-dissertation at the University of Groningen
through Prof. T. Piersma.
We oﬀer a full-time PhD position for 4 years, a pension
scheme, a health insurance allowance, a yearly 8% vaca-
tion allowance, year-end bonus and ﬂexible employment
conditions. Conditions are based on the Collective Em-
ployment Agreement of the NWO Research Institutes.

AdaptiveValueOfLearning
The adaptive value of learning in diﬀerent ecological
contexts
Despite a large amount of research into the mechanisms
of learning we still know almost nothing about how
cognitive traits might be adapted to diﬀerent ecolog-
ical conditions. This project provides a series of novel
experimental approaches to address this issue. Antici-
pated environmental change is almost certain to aﬀect
the structure and dynamics of pollination systems. A
more complete understanding of pollinator behaviour
means we will be better able to predict how the pol-
lination of crops and wild ﬂowers will be aﬀected by
environmental change.
Learning, or the adaptive modiﬁcation of behaviour
based on experience, is an important way in which
animals can respond to changes in their environment.
Many pollinators are actually faced with a complex en-
vironment in which to collect food - this ’pollination
market’ may contain dozens of ﬂower types which not
only vary in colour, shape and scent, but also in the
quantity and quality of rewards (principally pollen and
nectar) they present. The rewards on oﬀer may change
very rapidly over the course of the day depending on
the timing of reward provision by ﬂowers, climatic con-
ditions and the activity patterns of other ﬂower visi-
tors. Hence, learning to modify ﬂower choices rapidly
could be advantageous to a pollinator in circumstances
where the ﬂoral market is highly dynamic. This view is
supported by current data showing that colonies con-
taining faster learning individuals are more eﬃcient at
collecting nectar in the ﬁeld (Raine & Chittka 2008).
However, there is actually a large range in learning per-
formance among bee colonies with individuals in some
colonies learning much faster than others. Therefore, a
key question is what maintains this variability in cogni-
tive abilities if faster learning performance appears to
be at a selective advantage?
This project will investigate these questions using the
bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) as a model system in
both laboratory and ﬁeld experiments. Previous work
has shown that B. terrestris colonies are amenable to
laboratory learning experiments and that the same
colonies can subsequently be moved into the ﬁeld to as-
sess their foraging abilities (an established robust proxymeasure of colony ﬁtness) under ecologically relevant
conditions (Raine & Chittka 2007; 2008). This ap-
proach enables us to examine potential links between
cognitive abilities (tested in the laboratory) with forag-
ing performance (assessed under ﬁeld conditions). B.
terrestris is an important pollinator species which is
bred commercially for large-scale crop pollination. In
the laboratory several generations of bees can be raised
each year and this will form the basis of selection ex-
periment to examine the heritability of learning perfor-
mance. ’Fast’ and ’slow’ learning lines of bumblebee
colonies will be selectively bred from the most extreme
behavioural phenotypes observed in each generation.
The foraging performance of these colonies will then
be tested in a range of habitats to assess the ecologi-
cal conditions to which particular cognitive behavioural
phenotypes might be best adapted.
This project will also examine how variation in learning
performance between isolated B. terrestris populations
could be adapted to particular local ﬂoras. B. terrestris
occurs throughout Europe including many isolated is-
land populations. Preliminary data indicate a num-
ber of striking diﬀerences in learning ability between
colonies tested from several isolated populations. This
project will investigate whether these diﬀerences are
predictably linked to diﬀerences in local ﬂora in which
they each forage, particularly with respect to the degree
to which the most proﬁtable ﬂower species changes over
time (a trait which could favour faster learning).
For further details about the project please contact Dr.
Nigel Raine (nigel.raine@rhul.ac.uk).
Applications should be made by submitting a
completed application form (available from http://-
www.rhul.ac.uk/BioSci/Vacancies/SBSPhD2010.doc )
and a full CV by email to BioSciencesTemp@rhul.ac.uk
by 20th March. Candidates should arrange for two
academic references to be sent to the same email
address (BioSciencesTemp@rhul.ac.uk) by the same
date. It is anticipated that interviews will take place
in April.

BacterialEvolutionaryGenomics
PhD position in Bacterial Evolutionary Genomics at
the Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland
Quantifying phenotypic evolution in microbes
A PhD position in combined experimental and compu-
tational microbial genomics is available at the Biozen-
trum of the University of Basel. We are looking for a
highly motivated, skillful, and hard working individual
who has a strong interest in microbial evolution. The
project concerns a combined experimental and compu-
tational analysis of genome evolution in bacteria. Using
high-throughput quantiﬁcation of growth-phenotypes
for a large collection of natural isolates of bacteria, in
combination with genome sequencing of a large number
of strains, we aim to infer the selective pressures that
are driving adaptive phenotypic changes in bacteria on
short evolutionary time scales.
An integral part of the project will be computational
analysis of the data, including analysis of the relation
between genotypic and phenotypic changes, and evolu-
tionary modeling. Ultimately we aim to relate the re-
sults to patterns of genomic evolution that we have pre-
viously observed (e.g. van Nimwegen, Trends in Genet
19:9:479-484 (2003), Molina and van Nimwegen, Biol
Direct 3:51 (2008)).
A master’s diploma is required. Experience in one (or
more) of the following would be highly preferred: evolu-
tionary theory, microbiology, bioinformatics and com-
putational biology, or molecular biology, as the project
will involve both wet-lab and computational work. The
candidates should have good knowledge of English.
German knowledge is helpful but not necessary.
The position is in the group of Prof. Erik van Nimwe-
gen at the Biozentrum, University of Basel. The group
is highly interdisciplinary with members whose back-
grounds range from molecular biology to theoretical
physics. Although the main focus of the group has been
on theoretical and computational analysis, we have re-
cently added a wet lab component. The position will
be co-supervised by Dr. Olin Silander, who heads the
wet-lab. The Biozentrum in Basel oﬀers a stimulating,
international work environment with researchers work-
ing in related, relevant topics (microbiology, bioinfor-April 1, 2010 EvolDir 29
matics, etc). The working language at the Institute is
English. The salary is generous and is set according
to the guidelines of the Swiss National Science Founda-
tion. The start date will by mutual arrangement.
To apply, please send a motivation letter, CV, and
names and emails of two to three references by email
to: erik.vannimwegen@unibas.ch
We will start reviewing applications from 31st March
2010 onward. Do not hesitate to contact me if you
have further questions regarding the project.

UEdinburgh PlantTaxonomy
MSc Degree/Postgraduate Diploma in the Biodiversity
and Taxonomy of Plants
Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh/ University of Ed-
inburgh
Programme Philosophy The MSc in Biodiversity and
Taxonomy of Plants was established by the University
of Edinburgh and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
(RBGE) to address the growing worldwide demand for
trained plant taxonomists and whole-plant scientists.
A detailed knowledge of plants and habitats is funda-
mental to their eﬀective conservation. To communicate
such knowledge accurately and eﬀectively, training is
required in plant taxonomy ’ the discipline devoted to
plant diversity and evolution, relationships, and nomen-
clature. The MSc is perfect for those wishing to develop
a career in many areas of plant science: Survey and
conservation work in threatened ecosystems Assessment
of plant resources and genetic diversity Taxonomic re-
search Management of institutes and curation of collec-
tions A stepping stone to PhD research and academic
careers
Edinburgh is a unique place to study plant taxonomy
and diversity. The programme and students beneﬁt
widely from a close partnership between RBGE and the
University of Edinburgh (UoE). RBGE has one of the
world1s best living collections (15,000 species across our
four specialist gardens ’ 5% of world species), an herbar-
ium of three million specimens and one of the UK1s
most comprehensive botanical libraries. The School of
Biological Sciences at UoE is a centre of excellence for
research in Plant Sciences and Evolutionary Biology.
Recognised experts from RBGE, UoE, and from diﬀer-
ent institutions in the UK deliver lectures across the
whole spectrum of plant diversity. Most course work
is based at RBGE, close to major collections of plants,
but students have full access to the extensive learningfacilities of the university.
Aims and Scope The MSc provides biologists, conser-
vationists, horticulturists and ecologists with a wide
knowledge of plant biodiversity, as well as a thorough
understanding of traditional and modern approaches to
pure and applied taxonomy. Apart from learning about
the latest research techniques for classiﬁcation, students
should acquire a broad knowledge of plant structure,
ecology, and identiﬁcation.
Programme Structure This is an intensive twelve-month
programme and involves lectures, practicals, workshops
and essay writing, with examinations at the end of
the ﬁrst and second semesters. The course starts in
September of each year and the application deadline is
normally 31 March. Topics covered include: Functions
and philosophy of taxonomy Evolution and biodiver-
sity of the major plant groups, fungi and lichens Plant
geography Ecology of plants and ecosystems Conser-
vation and sustainability Production and use of ﬂoras
and monographs Biodiversity databases Phylogenetic
analysis Population and conservation genetics Tropical
ﬁeld course, plant collecting and ecology Curation of
living collections, herbaria and libraries Plant morphol-
ogy, anatomy and development Molecular systematics
Fieldwork and visits to other institutes are an integral
part of the course. There is a two-week ﬁeld course
to Belize in which students are taught ﬁeld collection
and identiﬁcation of tropical plants ecological survey
techniques. The summer is devoted to four months
of a major scientiﬁc research project of the student1s
choice or a topic proposed by a supervisor. These re-
search projects link in directly with active research pro-
grammes at RBGE.
Entry Requirements Applicants should ideally hold a
university degree, or its equivalent, in a biological, hor-
ticultural, or environmental science, and above all have
a genuine interest in plants. Relevant work experience
is desirable but not required. Evidence of proﬁciency in
English must be provided if this is not an applicant1s
ﬁrst language.
Funding The course is currently supported by eight
Natural Environment Research Council studentships
that are open to EU students only. Other international
funding bodies have supported overseas students in the
past.

tematics. The research group is undertaking a project,
funded in part by a grant from the Swedish Research
Council, that seeks to develop new methods of anal-
ysis based upon the multispecies coalescent to distin-
guish between incongruence among gene trees caused
by lineage sorting, hybridization or paralogy. This new
approach requires novel data that will be drawn from
the Mediterranean legume genus Medicago, making use
of the nearly complete genome sequence available in
M. truncatula. We also are seeking to optimize high
throughput sequencing techniques to improve the ef-
ﬁciency for the kind of sampling used in systematic
projects (i.e., many individuals for 5 ˆ a 20 unlinked
genes). The successful applicant would be involved in
some or all of these areas depending upon their incli-
nation and skills.
Tasks The major task for the successful applicant will
be to conduct their PhD research under the supervi-
sion and direction of Dr Bernard Pfeil. Secondary tasks
will be to improve the applicantˆ as bench and analyt-
ical skills and theoretical breadth during their educa-
tion. Speciﬁc tasks associated with the research project
include: DNA extraction, PCR, molecular cloning,
Southern probing, probe design, preparation of mate-
rial for 454 sequencing, restriction enzyme digestion,
PCR primer design, sequence contig assembly, phylo-
genetic analysis, assessment of incongruence, eﬀectivepopulation size estimation, molecular dating, coales-
cent simulation.
Qualiﬁcations The applicant must have: –A Masterˆ as
degree or a Fil. Mag. in Biology or similar (such as a

PlantEvolutionaryGenetics
PhD Student position in Plant Evolutionary Genetics
A PhD student position in evolutionary genetics is
available in the lab of Tanja Slotte at the Department
of Evolutionary Biology, Evolutionary Biology Centre
(EBC), Uppsala University.
I study the evolution of reproductive traits and genes
in plants, with a focus on Arabidopsis relatives. There
are currently two main projects in the lab: 1) Evolu-
tion of ﬂoral and reproductive traits in Capsella and
2) Genetics of adaptation to past and current climate
change in Arabis alpina. There is an opportunity for a
PhD student to work on either of these projects, which
are outlined below.
In Capsella, marked changes in ﬂoral and reproductive
traits have occurred in association with the shift to self-
ing, which is well- characterized and appears to have
occurred relatively recently. It is therefore of consider-
able interest to understand the genetic basis and evolu-
tionary forces underlying these rapid changes. To study
these questions, we use a combination of approaches in-
cluding QTL mapping and population genomics. Here,
we are looking for a student who is interested in eluci-
dating the role of regulatory changes for the evolution
of reproductive traits in Capsella. The project will in-
volve assessing genetic correlations between phenotypic
traits and gene expression, as well as expression QTL
mapping, and population genomic tests for selection.
Arabis alpina is an alpine plant species that occurs
across a wide geographic area, and which oﬀers an ex-
cellent opportunity to test hypotheses on local adap-
tation and sensitivity to climate change. Within this
project, the student will test whether populations from
diﬀerent parts of the species’ range diﬀer in their re-
sponses to temperature treatments, map genomic re-
gions responsible for such diﬀerences and test whether
those genomic regions show a signature of divergent se-34 EvolDir April 1, 2010

also possibility for ﬁeld work in collaboration with the
group of Jon ˚Agren at the Dept of Plant Ecology at

Both projects will entail experimental work in the
greenhouse and the lab, as well as a substantial amount
of computational work, including analysis of next-gen
sequencing data. We therefore seek a highly motivated
student with a Master’s degree or equivalent in biol-
ogy, genetics or a related ﬁeld and with a strong in-
terest in population genetics and/or quantitative ge-
netics. Experience of experimental work with plants,
molecular genetic work, and documented interest in
statistics and programming is beneﬁcial but not re-
quired. The person should work well as part of a
team but also independently, and be proﬁcient in both
written and spoken English. The successful candidate
will join a research group led by Tanja Slotte (see

Importance of waterborne seed dispersal for conserva-
tion of alder-dominated riparian woodlands
Black alder, Alnus glutinosa Gaertn, is the most abun-
dant native tree in Scottish riparian woodlands where
it plays a key ecological role. Despite its importance
in riparian ecosystem function, the reproduction and
dispersal dynamics of the species has been little stud-
ied. Seeds are small and equipped with air-ﬁlled wings
that enable them to ﬂoat. Long-distance water disper-April 1, 2010 EvolDir 35
sal of seeds for several km is therefore believed to be
driven by ﬂowing water. This project proposes to in-
vestigate the relationship between river ﬂow dynamics
and and river margin colonisation by alder via water-
borne seed dispersal in a river catchment using a land-
scape genetics approach. Field activities will be based
in Scotland; in the river Tay catchment which contains
large areas of undisturbed alder dominated ﬂoodplain
habitat of high nature conservation value. Laboratory
activities will involve genotyping of microsatellite mark-
ers to detect patterns of seed-mediated gene dispersal.
The project will oﬀer scope to develop a geographically-
explicit model integrating ecological and genetics data
in order to investigate how landscape characteristics,
such as fragmentation by dams and ﬂood embank-
ments, aﬀects dispersal distance and connectivity of
alder-dominated riparian woodlands and thus inform
their conservation management.
The project will require a combination of ﬁeld work,
molecular biology, data analysis and modeling. Indi-
viduals with an interest in ecological genetics are en-
couraged to apply. The successful candidate will join
the restoration genetics group in the School of Biolog-
ical and Environmental Sciences at the University of

Understanding sociality: group size and foraging re-
wards
The evolution of eusociality, in which some individuals
forfeit their own reproduction and help others to repro-
duce, is a central problem in evolutionary biology. To-
gether with cooperatively-breeding vertebrates, wasps
and bees are ideal study systems, partly because they
exhibit a wide range of social levels. Funding is secured
for the studentship, which would focus initially on test-
ing a potentially fundamental advantage of sociality in
terms of foraging rewards. While some social insect
foragers can recruit others to food patches, individu-
als in small social groups forage independently. Un-
der independent foraging, day-to-day variation in the
group’s total foraging success should be smaller as the
number of foragers (i.e. group size) increases: groups
should have an advantage compared with lone individu-
als in terms of increased day-to-day reliability in forag-
ing rewards. More reliable foraging rewards may allow
groups to ’plan ahead’ more successfully than lone in-
dividuals. For example, groups should be able to more
closely match the number of oﬀspring being reared to
their more predictable food supply. Lone individuals,
in contrast, should face large daily ﬂuctuations in their
foraging rewards. Lone individuals may be forced to
abort excess oﬀspring if short-term foraging success is
unexpectedly low; or waste excess food if foraging is un-
expectedly successful. Both eﬀects should reduce their
reproductive eﬃciency compared with groups.
The studentship will initially involve testing these ideas
using wasps and bees, followed by subsequent work de-
termined by the developing interests of the student. It
is straightforward to record successful foraging events
by observing or videoing social insect nests, and to
carry out experimental manipulations. Experiments
are likely to involve ﬁeldwork trips abroad in Spain
(Polistes paper wasps) and/or Malaysia (Liostenogaster
hover wasps), as well as in the UK (halictine sweat
bees), accompanied by other members of the research
group. Note: the insects studied live in very small
colonies ( <5-10 individuals) and almost never sting hu-
mans!!

ProgrammerBioinformatician
- Programmer/Bioinformatician -
There is an opening (fall 2010) for a program-
mer/bioinformatician with a strong interest in compu-
tational genomics to work in our research group at the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology
(Department of Evolutionary Genetics). One main aim
in the laboratory is the characterization of genes whose
protein functions require the trace element selenium.
These genes incorporate selenium in the form of se-
lenocysteine, the 21st amino acid in the genetic code,
and are known as selenoprotein genes. Building on our
expertise in the computational identiﬁcation and an-
notation of selenoprotein genes in eukaryotic genomes,
the programmer/ bioinformatician will develop compu-
tational pipelines to annotate genes and other genomic
features, analyze data from re-sequencing and compar-
ative expression experiments and manage the relational
database SelenoDB. We will aim to provide a compre-
hensive view of the selenoprotome’s function and evo-
lution to selenium researchers. Ample opportunities for
the analysis of primate genomes in collaboration with
other groups in the Department will exist.
We are seeking a motivated, well-organized and creative
person. Previous research experience and knowledge of
scripting languages and relational databases are advan-
tadges. The programmer/bioinformatician will receive
a payment according to Max Planck Institute rates.
The working environment of the institute is English-
speaking, and the members constitute a highly inter-
national group. The institute is in Leipzig, a pleas-
ant city of 500,000 inhabitants situated two hours from
Berlin and three hours from Prague. Applicants should
send their CV, transcripts and name and address of
two references (in PDF format) to Dr. Sergi Castellano

who can design a novel and well structured 5-year re-
search project to explore hominin subsistence strate-
gies. The call for research proposals is intentionally
broad. We seek a group leader with an expertise in one
of the related areas of research but who is encouraged
to take a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the
research question that they propose. This may include,
for example, methods such as zooarchaeology, isotopic
studies, or modelling, as well as related disciplines.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropol-
ogy has ﬁve departments, including the Department
of Human Evolution (Director: Jean-Jacques Hublin),
with which the Max Planck Research Group will be
associated. Therefore, although this is an indepen-
dent Research Group we would expect that the pro-
posed project and team would interact with the De-
partment of Human Evolution, and can use the ex-
tensive research facilities available (Further informa-
tion may be obtained at http://www.eva.mpg.de/ and
http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/.)
This is a fulltime research position. The salary will
be at the W2 level on the German university scale,
equivalent to an assistant/associate professor. There
are associated funds for research scientists to work in
the group, speciﬁcally funding for one post-doctoral
scientist (13/14 TV¨ oD) and two PhD students, as well
as two technicians. Start-up funds for equipment are
available, and a substantial yearly budget for operating
costs will be provided. The appointment will be for
a term of 5 years. Further information on the Max
Planck Research Groups may be obtained at http:/-
/www.mpg.de/english/institutesProjectsFacilities/-
juniorResearchGroups/aboutJrg/index.html
Applicants should have demonstrated outstanding re-
search potential and clear evidence of achievement. Ap-
plicants should have a Ph.D. obtained within the last 5
years.
The Max Planck Society is committed to employing
more handicapped individuals and to increasing the
share of women in areas where they are underrepre-
sented, and therefore expressly encourages applications
from such qualiﬁed individuals.
Applications should include a CV, a detailed research
plan (max. 8 pages), and the names of three referees
and must be received at the address below by *May 15,
2010*.

454 Sequencing facilities
Hi all,
can anyone recommend a US core facility for 454 se-
quencing? We want to do one full run using GS
FLX (non-titanium) long-read chemistry (= 250bp av.
reads), and the sstDNA library prep has already been
done... so just emPCR titration & shotgun sequencing
for this particular project. Main considerations would
be (1) cost, and (2) turn-around time. Any suggestions
would be much appreciated.

Hi all,
here’s a compilation of responses to my question about
454 sequencing facilities.
cheers, Ryan

FLX (non-titanium) long-read chemistry (= 250bp av.

done... so just emPCR titration & shotgun sequencing
for this particular project. Main considerations would
be (1) cost, and (2) turn-around time. Any suggestions
would be much appreciated.
General outcome:
(1) Seem to be looking at $US10-12K for a full plate
run (incl. titration), but library prep will add another
$500+.
(2) minimum 10-14 days, up to 4 weeks in some cases.
If have want to do just a 1/2 plate or less, will need
to wait for someone else with similarly-sized project, so
that the plate can be shared
(3) worth noting that Roche/454 are rapidly phasing
out the non-titanium option, so regaents will become
harder to come by soon. This also means that if you
want to run only a 1/2 plate with this older chemistry,
you might end up waiting a long time for a partner to
share that other 1/2 of the plate with you.

ABI7900HT vs BioradCFX384
Hi All,
We’re about to invest in a real time PCR system and
have been looking at ABI’s 7900HT (fast 384 wells) and
Bio-rad’s CFX384. We would primarily use the system
for SNP validation and low to medium thoughput SNP
genotyping. In addition, we aim to do some quantita-
tive PCR. It would be nice to hear from users of these
systems about the pros and cons and how they com-
pare.
Thanks

Alternative to Futuyma Textbook
Recommendation58 EvolDir April 1, 2010
Hi, everyone:
I have been using Futuyma to teach my Evolutionary
Biology course thus far. Personally, I like the breadth
of topics in Futuyma but I have found that it is a little
too advanced for my students and I skip 1/3 or more
of the sections for that reason. All of the other books
I’ve looked at - example: Kardong’s “Introduction to
Biological Evolution” is too basic for what I would like
to do. Ideally, I’d like to ﬁnd something intermediate
between Futuyma and one of these ultra-basic texts -
with a somewhat smaller price tag as well.
Once I have some feedback I’ll send a summary of what
I learn back to the list. Thanks in advance for any rec-
ommendations that get passed along. You can email
me directly at:

Annotating Haplotypes
My last two postings to the EvolDir have proven ex-
tremely helpful, so I thought I would try another. This
one is in the spirit of “the only really stupid ques-
tion is the one that’s not asked.” I have never seen
clear instructions on how to indicate haplotype frequen-
cies in the various DNA ﬁle formats (FASTA, NEXUS,
PHYLIP, etc.). When I want to load both haplotype
sequence and frequency information into a program like
DNAsp, TCS, etc. I’ve typically been simply making
multiple entries of the same sequence. So, if there are
three copies of “Haplotype 1” in a population, I write
its sequence (and its name) 3 times. But, as the num-
bers get bigger, this seems so incredibly clumsy to me,
that I “know” there must be a better way of doing it.../
Any hints would be much appreciated.

Assignment tests with GeneClass2
Dear all,
we are trying to assign individuals to potential pop-
ulations of origin with the GeneClass2 software, but
for some reason unknown to us GeneClass does not ac-
cept our ﬁle with the to-be-assigned individuals. We
have tried Genepop and Genetix ﬁles, and the wholeApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 59
ﬁle (as for self-assignment purposes) is working ﬁne,
but as soon as we delete all pops except the individuals
to be assigned it does not work any more. We have not
found any reference input ﬁles for individuals to be as-
signed so we do not know exactly how they should look.
Perhaps someone can help us on this or even provide a
working inﬁle.
Any feedback will be highly appreciated.
Yours sincerely,

Assignment tests with GeneClass2
answers
Dear all,
with respect to my recent query concerning the
GeneClass2 software I was using to carry out assign-
ment tests I have received a couple of well-informed
responses.
My main problem was that the software did not ac-
cept my ﬁle containing the to-be-assigned individuals.
This held irrespective of whether I used a Genepop
or Genetix format (both of which are supported by
GeneClass2).
The advice that ﬁnally made the software run was to
add a .dat extension to the ﬁles. The software then
immediately accepted the inﬁles. However, when I
re-downloaded the software, it even accepted the ﬁles
without this extension. So, eventually it might have
been to do with my computer, too.
Anyway, thank you very much out there for sharing
your experiences with me. Should anyone need a work-
ing inﬁle, he or she is welcome to contact me.
All the best,
Frank

BirdEvolution
We are looking for an enthusiastic ﬁeld assistant (Euro-
pean nationality) who is interested in working in a ﬁeld
experiment on Great tits in Bern, Switzerland. The
work will start immediately and last until the end of
June 2010. In the experiment we will study the inﬂu-
ence of parasites on immune and stress response of the
host. The great tits are a good system to study the
eﬀect of ectoparasites on life-history traits since they
readily accept nest boxes making them easy to manip-
ulate and follow from egg laying to oﬀspring ﬂedging.
The successful candidate will be involved in all the as-
pects of the work, including ringing the birds, count-
ing ﬂeas, conducting recordings, and measuring body
indices of the birds. Motivation is very impor-
tant as the work is hard and demanding, may take
place in changing weather and requires long hours
at times. Accommodation and transportation within
Europe will be provided. Some ﬁnancial assistance
will also be available to cover living expenses. Can-
didates must hold a valid European driving license.

Answers:
1) Hi Romina - If you are looking for an inexpensive
way to go - check our hour homemade version, very
easy to make and extremely eﬀective.
For the earliest and rudimentary version see - http:/-

2) Hi Romina,Your email was passed onto me from Pro-
fessor Wetherall. For hard tissues like insect legs or
whole insects we use a method called ANDE which has
been used by several agricultural labs for nondestruc-
tive DNA extraction for PCR purposes only - it is not
suitable if you want good quality DNA.
more information can be found at http://-

3) Dear Romina
We extract from insects using the qiagen blood and tis-
sue kit (both tubes and 96 well plates), but have used a
variety of kits. Presently we also use a plate extraction
kit from zygem. We do not homogenise tissue we incu-
bate either whole insects, or parts of them (e.g. legs)
in the extraction buﬀer with proteinase K, and then
remove the body parts before continuing with the ex-
traction. This works ﬁne, thus there is little need for
you to homogenise tissue.
Cheers Brent
4) Hi Romina, We used qiagen animal tissue extraction
kit. It works well with insect legs.
Qixin
5) Hello Romina, In response to your email below : we
use a TissueLysser from Qiagen, and to extract DNA
and RNA from leaf tissue it is very eﬃcient...
Best wishes, Raquel Carvalho
6) Hi Romina,April 1, 2010 EvolDir 61
I work on ants, and we homogenize using an electric
power drill that you can buy in a hardware store. Just
stick in the usual pestle instead of the drill bit, and
you’re set to go.
We are using the Qiagen kits, which work very well.
best, Beth
7) Hi Romina In plants, we freeze the tissue in liquid ni-
trogen, and grind by adding a metal bead and shaking.
This should work with insect parts too
You can do this in 96 well plate format using the
Geno/Grinder 2000 (or newer 2010 version) or the Qi-
agen Tissue Lyser
These machines don’t do the DNA extraction, but just
grind the tissue. It works with very hard tissues and
takes about 5 minutes or less
diana
8) Dear Romina,
In our facility we use Biomek FX robot for semi-
automated DNA extraction (elution is done manually,
to minimize chances of contamination). Please ﬁnd at-
tached my papers and detailed protocol for DNA ex-
traction which is suitable for insects. For insects you
don’t actually need tissue homogenization, simply use
overnight incubation at 56C. Biomek robots are quite
sophisticated, but the software is intuitive.
For plants we use similar protocol (see attached paper),
but use Tissue Lyser and stainless steel beads for grind-
ing.
Please let me know if you have more questions.
Best regards, Nataly
9) Dear Romina
I tested the Maxwell 16 on tough Eucalyptus leaves and
it did not crush them very well. The Retsch mixer mill
works well for most eucalypt leaves though (after they
have been frozen in liquid nitrogen).
The Promega reps (at least in Australia) are very nice
and might lend you a machine and give you a kit to test
the protocol in your species of interest.
Good luck Rebecca

GeneMapperSoftware in Windows7
Hello all
I ﬁnally installed GeneMapper v3.5 in a Windows2000
virtual machine, over a Windows7 operative system,
and it works well (at least until now).
Some colleges gave me some advices about it:
- The software can cause major troubles even when runApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 63
with the right operating system and on an AB certiﬁed
computer. So is better to get a computer dedicated to
this work if you do not want crashes and data loss
- You should load your data ﬁles in the same operative
system where you are running the software. It makes
it run faster.
- And an alternative to GeneMapper is a software that
Dr. F.Palero has developed recently. It reads the .fsa
ﬁles using PeakScanner (free- download) and get the
peaks by means of a simple ﬁle where you can set the
features of your microsatellites.
It allows you to deﬁne the bin set automatically
with AlleloBin or manually using R. It is called
P2EMA and you can download it for free from http:/-
/sourceforge.net/projects/p2ema/ There you could
download also PeakScanner and R. It hasn’t been tested
yet in Windows7 but it works well in WindowsXP, and,
according to Microsoft, the softwares that run in Win-
dowsXP should work in Windows7 too.
If you want to know more about it you can contact with
Dr.F.Palero fpalero@ist.ac.at

Herpetology teaching specimens
I am developing a herpetology course at Tulane Univer-
sity and need to put together a collection of preserved
specimens to use in conjunction with the laboratory
portion of the course. Tulane had a teaching collection
long ago but after years of non-use, it was donated to
another university.
With this in mind, I am wondering if there are other
herpetology teaching collections going unused that peo-
ple wouldn’t mind donating to help me get Tulane’s
new collection started? Any leads and any reptile or
amphibian material would be appreciated. I’m more
than happy to arrange for shipping or pick-up.

PROGRAM OUTLINE
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) is pleased to make available 10 awards for un-
dergraduate students to participate in a Mentoring and
Diversity Program. Five of these positions will be re-
served for undergraduates from traditionally underrep-
resented groups in our scientiﬁc discipline.
The goals of this program are: (1) to provide students
with the opportunity to experience the excitement of
attending and presenting at an international scientiﬁc
conference, (2) to foster enthusiasm for molecular biol-
ogy and evolution as well as a possible career in this
ﬁeld, and (3) to promote diversity at the SMBE annual
meeting.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Mentoring and Diversity Program Award
will be paired with two mentors, one a senior gradu-
ate student and the other a postdoctoral fellow or fac-
ulty member. Mentors will serve as contact points for
the students, attend some sessions with the students,
and, more generally, explain the “goings-on” at a multi-
day scientiﬁc conference in order to minimize the anx-
iety often felt by ﬁrst-time conference attendees. The
mentors will also facilitate connections to graduate stu-
dents, postdoctoral fellows and faculty members.
ELIGIBILITY
Candidates must currently be enrolled as undergrad-
uate students (Bachelor’s level degree) or have gradu-
ated within the last 6 months at the time of application.
Some awards will be reserved for undergraduates from
traditionally underrepresented groups in our scientiﬁc
discipline.CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION
Recipients of an SMBE Undergraduate Diversity Men-
toring Program Award will be invited to present their
research at a special reception/poster session attended
by their mentors, supervisors and other interested con-
ference participants.
AWARDS
Ten awards will be given. Award recipients residing
in Europe will receive US $1,000 to be used to help
cover the cost of airfare, accommodation, and meeting
registration. All other recipients will receive US $1,500.
Each participant will also receive an online student sub-
scription to the journal Molecular Biology and Evolu-
tion for the year of 2011.
APPLICATION
1. Faculty members may nominate undergraduates by
sending a brief letter of recommendation and the ab-
stract of the work to be presented at the poster session.

MrBayes positive loglikelihood

Dear members, Im currently running a MrBayes phylo-
genetic analysis of an insect mitochondrial gene (COI)
and the following problem happened to me several
times. After several generations of standard devia-
tion of split frequencies around 0.005 (which seems to
show that convergence is close) the likelihood value of
the cold chain switches from a negative value around
-1576 to a value of 21786.283 and convergence gets im-
possible to achieve. A warning saying: WARNING:
In LIKE EPSILON - for division 0 char 7 has like =
0.000000000000000000000000000000 also starts to ap-
pear from time to time. Has anyone experienced a
problem like that? A tried to increase the number of
generations, the number of heated chains, to decreasethe temp value and to switch to a more realistic model,
as suggested, but nothing seems to work Has anybody
a good piece of advice? Thanks in advance, Romina

NSF Dimensions of
Biodiversity,FAQposted
I call your attention to NSF1s Dimensions of Bio-
diversity initiative ( http://www.nsf.gov/funding/-
pgm summ.jsp?pims id=503446&org=BIO&from=-
home ) and the new FAQ just posted on our website.
3The Dimensions of Biodiversity initiative seeks to
characterize biodiversity on Earth by using integrative,
innovative approaches to ﬁll rapidly the most substan-
tial gaps in our understanding of the diversity of life on
Earth. This campaign will take a broad view of biodi-
versity, and in its initial phase will focus on the integra-
tion of genetic, taxonomic, and functional dimensions
of biodiversity. Successful proposals should integrate
these three dimensions to understand interactions and
feedbacks among them. While this focus complements
several core NSF programs, it diﬀers by requiring that
multiple dimensions of biodiversity be addressed simul-
taneously, in innovative or novel ways, to understand
the roles of biodiversity in critical ecological and evolu-
tionary processes.2

Phyloseminar JensLagergren Mon29
On March 29th, phyloseminar.org will present Jens
Lagergren speaking on “Probabilistic analysis of gene
families with respect with gene duplication, gene loss,
and lateral gene transfer.” Abstract below.
NOTE: the seminar will begin at 10h PST, which is
three hours earlier than the previous seminars.
This is 13h Eastern Standard Time, 19h Central Euro-
pean Time, and 6h in Christchurch and Auckland!
Here’s the abstract:
Incongruences between gene trees and corresponding
species trees are common. Gene duplication, gene loss,
and lateral gene transfer are three types of evolution-
ary events that can cause such incongruences. I will
ﬁrst describe a probabilistic process that contains stan-
dard models of nucleotide substitutions (i.e., such that
underly probabilistic methods for phylogenetic tree re-
construction) as well as gene duplication and gene loss.
This process takes place in a given species tree and can
be used to reconstruct a gene tree for a gene family of
interest and simultaneously reconcile the gene tree with
the species tree. I will describe the algorithms available
for this model and also describe how they perform on
biological data compared to competing methods. Fi-
nally, I will describe an extension of this model that
also contains lateral gene transfer and show how it per-
forms on synthetic data.Hope to see you there!

Protect Lake Baikal petition
Dear colleagues,
It has not been widely publicized in the news, but there
has been a very unfortunate turn of events for Lake
Baikal, the largest and the most ancient lake on the
planet and one of the UNESCO World Nature Her-
itage Sites. On January 13, the Russian government
made several changes in the list of activities prohib-
ited in the area of Lake Baikal that allowed the re-
opening of the Baikalsk pulp and paper mill, the main
air and water polluter in the region. This decision is
very unpopular in Russia, but the opposition is being
suppressed (e.g., http://www.www.greengrants.org/-
breakingnews.php?news id=271 ). Furthermore, the
government is propagating the myth that there is no
scientiﬁc evidence for the negative eﬀect of the mill
on Lake Baikal. I am trying to gather support from
the scientiﬁc community in order to convince Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev to revert the changes in
the regulation. I posted an open letter at http:/-
/www.ipetitions.com/petition/baikal/ and ask you to
sign it.

Q Value software help
In the past, I’ve used the q value software package to
control the false discovery rate when making large num-
ber of pairwise comparisons of gene frequencies or Fst
values (I’m one of those who feel that the typical Bon-
ferroni “correction” is too conservative for preliminary
surveys). However, I can’t get the latest versions ofthe software to run on any of my computers, MAC OS
10.4.x, 10.5.x, or Windows XP Professional. In every
case, the program loads the P values from a text ﬁle,
but then “hangs” at the “Execute” stage. In each case,
I believe that I have the correct version of R (the sta-
tistical package that supports the Q value calculations)
installed and running, with the appropriate interface
also. However, I’m no “R” expert by any means, and
I could be making some obvious mistake that I’m (not
so blissfully) unaware of...
I would appreciate knowing if there is anyone out there
successfully running “Q value” on machines like mine,
and if so, can I get some advice? I have been unable to
contact any Q value support groups. Does the LINUX
version work better?
Thanks to all.

2010 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY FOR
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
July 4-8, Lyon, France
CONFERENCE WEBSITE http://smbe2010.univ-
lyon1.fr/ PROGRAM OUTLINE
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) will make available 10 awards for undergrad-
uate students to participate in a Mentoring and Diver-
sity Program. Five of these positions will be reserved
for undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented
groups in our scientiﬁc discipline. The goals of this pro-
gram are: (1) to provide undergraduate students with
the opportunity to experience the excitement of attend-
ing and presenting at an international scientiﬁc confer-
ence, (2) to foster enthusiasm for molecular biology and
evolution as well as a possible career in this ﬁeld, and
(3) to promote diversity at the SMBE annual meeting.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Mentoring and Diversity Program Award
will be paired with two mentors, one a senior gradu-
ate student; the other a postdoctoral fellow or faculty
member.
Mentor activities will include:
1. Attending some conference sessions with the student,
answering questions about the basic concepts being pre-
sented, and, more generally, explaining the “goings-on”
at a multi-day scientiﬁc conference in order to mini-
mize the anxiety often felt by ﬁrst-time conference at-
tendees..
2. Interacting with the student during some mealtimes,
coﬀee breaks and other social gatherings.
3. Introducing the student to other undergraduates,
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty
members as a way of facilitating connections with po-
tential future graduate supervisors and colleagues.
4. Attending the poster session and SBME Undergrad-
uate Mentoring and Diversity Program Award recep-April 1, 2010 EvolDir 71
tion with the student.
WE ARE SEEKING INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED
IN BEING A MENTOR
If you are interested in mentoring an undergraduate at
this year’s SMBE meeting in Lyon, please email Dan

SNP genotyping companies answers
Hello everybody, I posted a question a few weeks ago
regarding a company /an institution that does SNP
genotyping for reasonable prices and as some people
asked me to post the answers, here they are. My orig-
inal question is posted below. Thanks a lot to all who
responded, your comments were very helpful! By the
way: we have not decided yet which oﬀer to take, so
there is no ﬁnal judgement from my side. But it seems
that the actual price is going to be like 12,000 Euros at
least - if you go for a company. Best, Katharina
— Hi all, Does anyone know (and recommend) a com-
pany (or any other institution) that genotypes home-
made SNPs for a reasonable price? We have ﬁsh DNA
of at least 2-400 individuals and would like to genotype
around 100 SNPs (already developed) in them. The of-
fers we got so far range around at least 20,000 Euros,
which overspends our budget... Happy for any sugges-
tion, Katharina

Software Poptree2
Dear All:
We are pleased to announce the availability of the
new Windows-interfaced computer program pack-
age POPTREE2 ( http://www.med.kagawa-u.ac.jp/-
˜ genomelb/takezaki/poptree2/index.html ). POP-
TREE2 computes various genetic distance measures
and constructs phylogenetic trees of populations or
closely related species from allele frequency data by us-
ing the neighbor-joining method and UPGMA. Boot-
strap tests can be performed for phylogenetic trees.
POPTREE2 also computes heterozygosities and Gst,
measures of the extent of genetic variation in a pop-
ulation and genetic diﬀerentiation among subdivided
population. All the computation can be done through
a simple Windows-interface and phylogenetic trees can
be displayed and changed in a publishable form in the
same Windows-interface.
The distance measures that can be computed are (i) Da
distance (Nei et al. 1983), (ii) Nei’s standard genetic
distance (Dst) (Nei 1972), (iii) Fst* distance (Latter
1972), (iv) delta mu square distance (Goldstein et al.
1995), and (v) Dsw distance (Shriver et al. 1995). Delta
mu square distance and Dsw distance can be used only
for microsatellite DNA data, in which alleles are rep-
resented by the number of repeats, whereas Da, Dst,April 1, 2010 EvolDir 73
and Fst* can be used for any kind of allele frequency
data. Dst and Fst*, heterozygosities, and Gst are com-
puted by the original method without sample size bias
correction as well as with bias correction. The details
of the computational methods are available in the user
guide of POPTREE2. The command-line versions of
POPTREE for DOS and UNIX (POPTREE version 1)
are also available.
The instructions for using POPTREE2 have been pub-
lished in Molecular Biology and Evolution 27:747-752.

Software TreeBASE
We are pleased to release a new version of Tree-
BASE – a database of phylogenetic knowledge: http:/-
/www.treebase.org . TreeBASE is designed to serve as
a digital archive of phylogenetic data reported in peer-
reviewed scientiﬁc publications.
Improvements include:
- Richer annotation of metadata (journal DOIs, speci-
men georeferences, Genbank accession numbers, etc) -
A mapping between taxon labels and taxonomic names
in uBio and NCBI for improved normalization of names
- The ability to visualize and edit trees using Phylowid-
get - The ability to search on tree topology - Data
are delivered in several serializations, including NEXUS
and NeXML - A special URL gives journal editors and
reviewers anonymous advanced access to data - Pro-
grammatic access to the data using the PhyloWS API.
Objects in TreeBASE (e.g. studies, trees, matrices)
can now be referenced with persistent and resolvable
URIs that serve as both globally unique identiﬁcation
numbers and resource locators. These URLs can be
included in the PDF of a journal article or on a re-
searcher’s website – so access to matrices and trees is
only a click away. Queries expressed in PhyloWS syntax
return results in RDF as RSS 1.0 feeds, which means
that users can set their favorite RSS Reader to fetch all
new TreeBASE studies that satisfy a particular query
(e.g. return all studies published in “Systematic Biol-
ogy,” or return all trees that include “Homo sapiens,”
etc).
For the short term, we will be busy patching bugs and
making ﬁxes. In the longer term we plan to continue
extending our API (e.g. providing URIs to clades, sub-
trees, etc) and adding classiﬁcations to allow searching
on higher ranks.
Below is our press release.74 EvolDir April 1, 2010
The TreeBASE Team.
Database gives researchers access to the latest ﬁndings
about the tree of life
Durham, NC - A vastly improved phylogenetics
database gives scientists and educators access to state-
of-the-art knowledge about the evolutionary relation-
ships among living things.
TreeBASE a database designed to help scientists store,
share, and study evolutionary trees was ﬁrst developed
in the mid-1990s as way to archive the vast amounts
of phylogenetic information accumulating in the litera-
ture.
“Phylogenies were being published at an explosive
rate,” said Bill Piel of Yale University. “What we
needed was a database where we could compile them
so people could use them later.”
The database allows researchers to archive and retrieve
published phylogenetic trees and data from diﬀerent
studies. “People can store sequence alignments, mor-
phological character sets, and the resulting phyloge-
netic trees - all in digital form. They can also be re-
covered and reanalyzed or combined with other data,”
Piel said.
Since the ﬁrst prototype was developed, researchers
have contributed more than 6,500 trees from over 2400
articles, describing the relationships among well over
60,000 taxa. A variety of journals now require their au-
thors to deposit phylogenetic data in TreeBASE, and
peer reviewers are given anonymous access to the data
prior to publication.
Years of work have gone into improving and upgrading
the original version. “At some point we knew we had
to make it bigger and better,” said Michael Donoghue
of Yale University. Now, a team of biologists and com-
puter scientists is releasing a new version that is com-
pletely rebuilt. With this upgrade, the database is
poised to become an increasingly valuable community
resource for a number of ﬁelds, including conservation
biology, biogeography, and education, developers say.
“We have introduced a wide variety of features that
simply didn’t exist before,” said Val Tannen at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. “In terms of data deposition
and how users interact with it, it has taken a huge leap
forward,” Donoghue added.
Much richer information can now be stored. “Trees can
contain information such as the length of each branch,
which is important for studying the timing of evolu-
tionary events,” Piel explained. The database also has
an improved system for making sure that information
such as taxonomic names and DNA sequence IDs matchthose found in other sources.
Researchers will be able to take advantage of a more
user-friendly interface and more advanced search tech-
niques. “There are things you can query now that
you couldn’t before,” said Piel. “For example, you can
search for trees that share a certain topology.”
“The visualization tools have also received a major up-
grade,” he added. “For example, now users can dynam-
ically manipulate and zoom in and out of large trees.”
A number of advanced features have been introduced
that will, says Piel, “allow bioinformaticians to do new
and creative things with the data without being blocked
by the user interface.” These include support for new
machine-readable phylogenetic data exchange and web
service standards.

SouthAfrica VolFieldAssist
MuridEvolution
Volunteers needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
>From May 2010 onwards
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in ﬁeld work relating
to evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons of group living, paternal care, communal nesting
and social ﬂexibility in the striped mouse. As this
species is diurnal and the habitat is open, direct be-
havioral observations in the ﬁeld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld willApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 75
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of
a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the ﬁeld. Volunteers are also expected to help with
maintenance of the research station (water pump, solar
power, etc.)
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1000 (around 100 Euro) must be paid for accommo-
dation at the research station. For students with their
own undergraduate project, a fee of Rand 1250 (approx.
120 Euro) per month applies. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
200 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 300 - 400 Euros per month. Students
get an invitation letter which they can use to apply for
funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany,
SANW in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for volunteers to start in May 2010 and especially for
the period June to December 2010. Volunteers are ex-
pected to stay at least 2 months, but longer periods of
up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch.

Teaching evidences of evolutionDear friends,
I am teaching Evolution for Biology students and I need
material (books, PDF articles, pictures, etc.) to teach
about EVIDENCES of evolution.
My idea is to show very easy and strong evidences like
the fossil record with simple forms appearing ﬁrst in the
strata (whales are not present ﬁrstly but invertebrates)
and molecules becoming more complex from inverte-
brates to vertebrates.
Thanks for any suggestions and material and I feel that
we need to produce more educational material about
this subject like movies and slide sets!!!

Treeview for WindowsVista and
above
I’ve had various reports that my (now ancient)
phylogeny-viewing program TreeView won’t install
on Microsoft Windows Vista and/or Windows 7.
I suspect this is due to the installer I used to
bundle the program, not TreeView itself. I’ve
created a new installer, available from http://-
taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html (see the
link labelled “Version for Windows Vista and later”)
that should install TreeView on Vista (and Windows 7,
although I’ve not had a chance to test on a Windows 7
machine).
I hope those users that have had trouble with Tree-
View on recent versions of Windows will now be able
to install the program.

Vol Field assist Great tits
Switzerland
I am seeking an enthusiastic candidate with a European
nationality interested in assisting a ﬁeld experiment on
Great tits in Bern, Switzerland. The work is to start
immediately and last until the end of June 2010. In the
experiment we will study the inﬂuence of avian preda-
tors, through maternal eﬀects, on life-history traits of
Great tits, and possible additional eﬀects on the ec-
toparasites of the tits. The great tits are a good system
to examine the eﬀects of predators and ectoparasites on
life-history of birds since they readily accept nest boxes
making them easy to manipulate and follow from egg
laying to oﬀspring ﬂedging.The successful candidate will be involved in all the
aspects of the work, including ringing the birds, sim-
ulating predators, conducting behavioral observations
and recordings, and more. Applicants with a BSc/Msc
in Biology/Ecology and with bird handling experience
would have an advantage. However, motivation will
play a key role: the work is hard and demanding, may
take place in changing weather and requires long hours
at times. Motivated applicants could develop their own
individual research on a topic related to the program
and their own interests, and if particularly motivated
could be involved in the publications. Accommoda-
tion and transportation within Europe will be provided.
Some ﬁnancial assistance will also be available to cover
living expenses.
Candidates must hold a valid European driving license.

French National Institute for Agricultural Research),
which is located in the neighbourhood of Clermont-
Ferrand, in the center of France.
The postdoc will have to develop and to use appro-
priate population genetic tools to study the genomic
diversity of closely related bacterial species within the
genus Borrelia. The dataset was obtained using a rese-
quencing approach based on next-generation sequenc-

understanding in how horizontal transfers and selective
pressures shaped the diversity of this model system,
which is invovled in Lyme disease.
The main activity of the postdoc will be the develop-
ment and the implementation of sequence analyses. She
or he will interact with biologists, informaticians and
statiscticians involved in the project. A strong experi-

*POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE *
Research topic : *Mechanisms of tolerance of plants to
virus infection*. Recent work in the group has been di-
rected at developing /Arabidopsis thaliana/ as a system
for the study of plant-virus co-evolution. Results have
shown the relevance of tolerance as a defence response
to viruses and, hence, its potential role in plant-virus
co-evolution. Analyses of natural variation (RILs) have
allowed identiﬁcation of QTLs determining tolerance to
virus infection in Arabidopsis. *Research will focus on
the analysis of candidate genes for tolerance to virus in-
fection and on the molecular mechanisms of tolerance*.
Period : 3 or 4 years, starting any time from now
Conditions : Contract conditions will be equivalent to
those of the Spanish “Juan de la Cierva” Programme
either funded by this programme or directly through
the research group.
Requisites : Experience in plant-pathogen co-
evolution or/and molecular evolution.

YeastNaturalHistory
Postdoctoral position: ecology and natural history of
wild Saccharomyces paradoxus yeast
*Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen,
Germany*
Experimental Evolution group, led by Duncan Greig
We are looking for an ecologist or evolutionary biologist
interested in studying the ecology of yeast in the wild.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a research ˆ asuper-modelˆ a,
particularly for genetics, but increasingly for evolution-
ary biology. However, very little is known about its
life in its natural habitat. Saccharomyces paradoxus,
an undomesticated relative of S. cerevisiae, is readily
isolated from the bark and leaves of oak trees. The
aim of this project is to study the growth, life cycle,
and dispersal of Saccharomyces paradoxus in oak and
in surrounding soil, water, and insects. We are inter-
ested in the microbial community in which S. paradoxusApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 87
lives and in reconstructing its natural environment in
the laboratory for future experiments. Although prac-
tical experience with yeast or other microbes would be
useful, it is not essential, and we would consider ap-
plications from well-qualiﬁed theoretical ecologists or
evolutionists interested in moving into the lab. In addi-
tion to studying the natural history and ecology of wild
Saccharomyces, the group also uses yeast in laboratory
experiments on social interactions, sexual selection, and
speciation.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology is
a well-funded, expanding, and vibrant research insti-
tution, with superb facilities. It is located in Ploen,
an attractive small town surrounded by lakes, a few
kilometres from the Baltic coast. Neighbouring larger
towns are Kiel and Lubeck, and the international air-
port at Hamburg is 80km away. Further information
on the institute can be found at:
http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/index.html The
position is potentially suitable for any level of postdoc
and will initially be funded for two years, with an ex-
tension for an additional year if appropriate. There is
no deadline for application ˆ a applications will be con-
sidered until the position is ﬁlled. Funding is available
immediately, and comes in two forms depending on na-
tionality. Foreigners can receive between 2100 and 3000
Euro per month, depending on experience, which is free
from income taxes and social insurance contributions.
Germans receive a similar grant, calculated according
to several factors such as age, marital and family status.
Contact d.greig@evolbio.mpg.de for more information
or to apply. Applications should comprise a letter de-
scribing the candidateˆ as research interests and relevant
experience, a CV, a list of publications, and contact
information for three referees.

Paris SelectionInVertebrateGenomes
Two post-doctoral positions are available in the DYO-
GEN group at the Ecole Normale Sup´ erieure (ENS) in
Paris.
Position 1: Funded by a European project, the research
topic involves the reconstruction of ancestral regulatory
circuits in vertebrates, with a particular emphasis on
the human X chromosome and genes involved in neuro-
logical disorders. The project will beneﬁt from a wealth
of data and methods already developped in the labora-
tory on ancestral genome reconstructions (e.g. Genomi-
cus at http://www.dyogen.ens.fr/genomicus ). The ideal
candidate will be familiar with large genomic datasets,
the construction of phylogenetic relationships, and will
be familiar with Linux/Unix and a programming lan-
guage (ideally Python). The 2-year position is to be
ﬁlled as soon as a suitable candidate has been found.
Position 2: The research subject will address the prob-
lem of identifying signatures of positive selection in ver-
tebrate genomes using SNPs collected from genome se-
quencing projects. The project will beneﬁt from meth-
ods already developped in the laboratory (Enard et al.
Plos Genetics 6(2): e1000840). The exact questions to
be investigated will depend on the candidate’s interest
and experience, but possible avenues include a focus
on co-occurences of candidate genes involved in human
diseases, with the possibility of resequencing DNA from
aﬀected individuals. The 2-year position is to be ﬁlled
as soon as a suitable candidate has been found.
Both positions oﬀer competitive salaries accord-
ing to experience. The DYOGEN lab ( http://-

Job: Post-doctoral Fellow at San Diego Zoo
The San Diego Zoo invites applications for a 4-
year post-doctoral research fellow to research, develop,
model, and test various strategies for genetically man-
aging herd or group-living species. The focus of the re-
search will be to meet the management needs of the Al
Ain Wildlife Park and Resort (AWRP) in Abu Dhabi,
U.A.E. The AWRP currently maintains large breeding
groups of antelope, including a number of species rec-
ognized by the IUCN as either Critically Endangered or
Extinct in the Wild. Traditional, pedigree-based meth-
ods used to manage the genetics of many zoo popula-
tions have proven diﬃcult to implement for herd species
at the AWRP and elsewhere because pedigrees are un-
known and speciﬁc breeding pairs can not be controlled.
Furthermore, many of the antelope species maintained
by the AWRP have projected or ongoing reintroduction
programs utilizing AWPR stock. Thus, the AWRP is
looking for innovative methods for managing the genet-
ics of these populations that incorporate reintroduction
eﬀorts. Focal species for this research include Arabian
oryx, scimitar horned oryx, and addax.
Qualiﬁed applicants will have a strong background in
population genetics, math, modeling or animal breed-
ing/herd management. Basic computer programming
skills will be necessary for modeling and testing dif-
ferent management strategies; applicants without pro-
gramming skills will be considered but must be willing
to learn those skills during the ﬁrst year of research.
Some experience with ﬁeld work, herd management and
international travel are preferred.

UGroningen SpatialModelling
At the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies
of the University of Groningen a PostDoc position is
available in the project Modelling the ecological impli-
cations of the spread of genes from transgenic crop into
wild relatives. The project is ﬁnanced by the Dutch Sci-
ence Foundation in the context of the focal programme
ERGO that was launched to assess the ecological impli-
cations of the introduction of transgenic crops. In the
project computer models will be developed to investi-gate under what conditions and to what extent gene
ﬂow involving transgenes will substantially aﬀect the
population ecology and evolution of wild relatives. The
main objective is to predict the dispersal pattern and
invasion prospects of a transgene on basis of the genet-
ics and life history of the plant species involved. This
modelling project is part of a larger project comprising
several experimental studies on the wild lettuce species
Lactuca serriola. The models will therefore be devel-
oped in close interaction with other ecologists and pop-
ulation geneticists, and the model predictions will be
validated with existing data.

UOulu Arabidopsis speciation
A post doctoral position (or possibly doctoral
student) at the University of Oulu is available
to work on genetics of speciation in Arabidop-
sis lyrata. ( https://wiki.oulu.ﬁ/display/PGG/-
The+Plant+genetics+group ). There is evidence of
incipient reproductive isolation between highly di-
verged lineages of A. lyrata. One part of the research
consists of a comparative study of genetics of the
reproductive isolation. Another part deals with exam-
ining the consequences of the genetic and phenotypic
divergence in an artiﬁcial hybrid zone of two diverged
lineages. Other studies in the group deal with the
genetics of adaptation of the diﬀerent populations.
The University of Oulu has good greenhouse, garden
and laboratory facilities. The position is funded by the
Biosciences and Environment Research council. The
position is for two years, but can be extended.
It is also possible to work on aspects of this project as
a doctoral student.
For further information, please get in touch with
Outi.Savolainen@oulu.ﬁ. Please send application as
soon as possible, preferably by March 28, but appli-
cations are considered until position is ﬁlled.

Postdoc position available at the Department of Sys-
tematics, Adaptation, Evolution (UMR 7138), Univer-
sity Pierre & Marie Curie (Paris 6).
A postdoctoral research position in evo-devo, funded
by the French “Agence Nationale de la Recherche”, is
available at the Department of Systematics, Adapta-
tion, Evolution at Pierre & Marie Curie University in
Paris. This postdoc will be in the research group of
Pr. Michael Manuel and will explore the evolutionary
origin of neuro-sensory cells by phylogenetic analyses of
neural gene families, expression analyses and functional
study of candidate genes, and/or comparative tran-
scriptomics, in the hydrozoan cnidarian Clytia hemis-
phaerica and the ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus.
Our research group investigates the origin and early
evolution of animal cell types and developmental regu-
latory mechanisms, taking advantage of the unique ex-
perimental possibilities oﬀered by our two model organ-
isms Clytia hemisphaerica (complete genome sequenc-
ing under progress) and Pleurobrachia pileus (36000
available ESTs, and 454 transcriptome sequencing un-
der progress). The range of available experimental tools
includes in situ hybridisation with embryonic and adult
stages, immunoﬂuorescence, morpholino-mediated gene
inactivation, and gene over-expression using synthetic
mRNA. Complementary to the candidate gene ap-
proach, we are currently undertaking a transcriptome
proﬁling approach to the systematic identiﬁcation of
transcripts that are over-expressed in neuro-sensory tis-
sues.
The post-doc project can be developed after the interest
of the applicant, but should preferably combine experi-
mental approaches (gene expression and function stud-
ies) and bioinformatics (comparative transcriptomics).
Our lab is situated in the campus of University Pierre
& Marie Curie, on the Left Bank (Rive Gauche) of the
river Seine, at the heart of one of the most famous dis-
tricts of the city centre, the lively Quartier Latin (Latin
Quarter). It is where the ﬁrst great Parisian university,
the Sorbonne, was founded, and the area has both a
signiﬁcant student presence and a very intense cultural
life. Our Department is an exciting arena for multidis-
ciplinary research in evolutionary biology, with researchApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 101

The Lep course, Chirichahua Mountains, SE Arizona
A Comprehensive Introduction to Lepidoptera Identiﬁ-
cation and Classiﬁcation
URL: www.lepcourse.org DATES 7-14 August 2010.
APPLICATION INFORMATION Applications due by
7 June 2010. Limited to 16 students. Application form
on website. Tuition for the course is $900 for students
and $1000 for non-students
OVERVIEW: With over 15,000 North American
species, Lepidoptera are an ideal indicator group for
biodiversity studies and are widely used in ecology and
evolutionary studies. Held at the SouthWest Research
Station (SWRS) in the Chirichahua Mountains in SE
Arizona (a 2 1/2 hour drive from Tucson), the focus of
the lep course is to train graduate students, post-docs,
faculty, and serious citizen-scientists in the classiﬁca-
tion and identiﬁcation of adult lepidoptera and their
larvae.
Topics to be covered include an extensive introduc-
tion into adult and larval morphology with a focus on
taxonomically-important traits, extensive ﬁeld work on
both adults and larvae, collecting and curatoral tech-
niques, genitalic dissection and preparation, larval clas-
siﬁcation, use (and abuse) of DNA bar coding, and gen-
eral issues in lepidoptera systematics, ecology, and evo-
lution.
THE LOCATION:
With its extensive series of Sky-Island mountain ranges,
SE Arizona has the highest lepidoptera diversity in
the US. With low desert scrub, oak and mixed oak-
pine woodland, lush riparian, juniper, Douglas ﬁr, and
mountain meadow habitats all within a 40 minute drive
from the station, the SWRS is an ideal location from
which to sample this diversity (of both habitats and
species).

MODELS IN EVOLUTION
Models help evolutionary biologists understand con-
cepts and processes that are fundamental to their sci-
ence. For example models help answer questions like
is ﬁtness? or kind of adaptation can be promoted by
selection? Models can also help set research priorities
by guiding experimental design. In particular, models
can answer questions like X really aﬀect Y? in advance
of costly and time-consuming experiments.
Whether you are inclined or inclined, then, you have
something to gain from adopting a modellers perspec-
tive. This course will focus on modelling techniques
used in evolutionary ecology. As a student, you will
be introduced to the mathematics applied in evolution-
ary game theory, population genetics, and combinations
thereof (i.e. kin selection or inclusive ﬁtness modelling).
You will learn how to formulate and analyse mathemat-
ical models of evolution at a level that will allow you to
understand (and hopefully contribute to) the current
literature.
Concepts will be reinforced with small assignments (set
by instructor) and one larger research project (topic to
be decided upon by the student).
Students may take the course for university credit, but
places are available to those wishing to audit. To apply,

ArthropodSymbiosis Jun30-Jul3
In the frame of the COST Action FA0701
/lessmuchArthropod Symbioses: from fundamental studies to
pest and disease management /greatermuch
We are pleased to announce the workshop entitled:
Evolution and Diversity of Symbioses of Arthropods
The workshop will be held from the 30th of June to the
3rd of July 2010 in Bad Bevensen, Germany.
Symbioses with bacteria and other microorganisms
have contributed greatly to the ecological and evolu-
tionary success of arthropods, either by providing es-
sential nutrients or digestive functions, or more un-
usual functions such as bioluminescence or contribut-
ing to healthcare of their hosts. Other endosymbionts
engage in more parasitic interactions with their hosts
by distorting their hosts sex ration to ensure their own
transmission. This stunning diversity of symbioses al-
ready became evident early in the 20th century, e.g. by
the wide range of associations included in Paul Buchn-
ers seminal book “Endosymbiose der Tiere emit Pﬂan-
zlichen Mikroorganismen” published in 1953.
Since then numerous symbiotic associations have been
characterized in great detail, with microbial partners
being identiﬁed, genomes of endosymbionts being se-
quenced and functions of the symbionts uncovered. The
use of culture independent techniques has led to a
great leap forward in uncovering the diversity present in
arthropod hosts as well as their speciﬁcity. Recent work
on a broad range of arthropod symbioses will be pre-
sented, with a wide range of microorganisms involved
that are located in a variety of organs such has antennal
glands, gut, malphigian tubules or reproductive tissue.
Whereas biologists recently became aware of the impor-
tance of mechanisms of host-symbiont interactions and
the involvement of the immune system as an interface
between the two, we are only beginning to understand
how the crosstalk between diﬀerent endosymbionts can
alter the outcome of symbiotic associations when hosts
harbour endosymbiont consortia and how diverse someof these consortia can be. In addition more and more
players in symbiotic interactions are uncovered as well
as new functions. Are such endosymbiont consortia sta-
ble in composition? Does competition among diﬀerent
endosymbionts for host resources harm the host as cer-
tain functions are provided in a lesser manner? How
easily can such endosymbiont consortia including gut
microﬂora be invaded by other microorganisms?
In this workshop, we welcome talks on diﬀerent kinds
of symbiotic interactions from mutualistic to para-
sitisic and comprising either single endosymbionts or
endosymbiont consortia. The very beginning of en-
dosymbiosis will be discussed. How are free living or-
ganisms incorporated into other organisms to become
endosymbionts?

Dear Colleagues,
WEBS (Women Evolving Biological Sciences) is an an-
nual three-day symposium aimed at addressing the re-
tention of female scientists and issues related to the
transition of women from early career stages to tenure
track positions and leadership roles in academic and
research settings. The 2007 and 2008 WEBS sym-
posia were huge successes. Early career participants
as well as our senior scientist panelists reported feel-
ing inspired and equipped with new connections and
tools that they expect will help them in their career
in the years to come. We are now accepting ap-
plications online ( http://www.webs.washington.edu <
http://www.webs.washington.edu/ >) for participation
in the 2010 symposium.
WEBS will target early career women in the Biological
Sciences with an emphasis on ecology and evolutionary
biology. In particular, it will focus on women who have
earned their doctoral degrees within the past two toeight years and who do not have tenure in order to ad-
dress the critical transition period from graduate stud-
ies and post-doctoral positions to permanent research
and teaching positions. The symposia will provide a fo-
rum for professional development, including awareness
and improvement of academic leadership skills; oppor-
tunities to establish mentoring relationships; and re-
sources for developing professional networks. The 2010
symposium will be held at the Pack Forest Conference
center near Seattle, WA from October 24-27, 2010.
Please visit our website ( http://-
www.webs.washington.edu < http://-

application materials. Applications are due April
15, 2010. Feel free to contact us with any questions
you might have (webs@u.washington.edu).

*** OPEN ENROLLMENT spaces still available***
Tropical Butterﬂy Ecology
This 2-week course is for advanced graduate students
interested in conducting tropical ﬁeld studies on butter-
ﬂies. The course will focus on the Costa Rican Atlantic
rainforest fauna, and include work at the La Selva Bio-
logical Station and the Tirimbina Biological Reserve
both sites share a diverse assemblage of Neotropical
butterﬂies, including many species that extend well into
South America.
The major thrust of this course will be natural history
and identiﬁcation of butterﬂy adults and early stages.
We will focus on behavior, diversity, ecological and evo-
lutionary patterns, symbiotic associations, ecophysiol-
ogy, quantitative sampling techniques, experimental de-
sign, and as well, the pleasures of conducting research
on tropical insects.
The course combines lectures, hands-on ﬁeld explo-
ration, and major eﬀorts on the part of students to
understand and apply quantitative observational and
sampling procedures in the ﬁeld. The course will stress
developing rigorous natural history questions from ﬁeld
observations.

Unique (and Low-Cost) Opportunity for Ten Under-
graduates 2011 Evolutionary Genetics Field Study
Abroad in China
*Learn Chinese and Evolutionary Genetics at the Un-
versity of Georgia*
With funding from NSF’s Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, we
are oﬀering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens or per-
manent residents only) the opportunity to participate
in a unique study abroad opportunity in China during
the spring and summer of 2011. This will be the 4th
year of the program and students have found it to be
enormously rewarding.
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic phy-
logeographic study of species that are native to China
and invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a grow-
ing number of species native to the southeastern U.S.
and invasive in China.
Each summer, we run an 8 week ﬁeld course where we
visit biological communities throughout China. Stu-
dents can elect to continue in short-term research in-
ternships in our partner labs in China.
Students will need to be prepared to take full advan-
tage of this experience. Therefore, during the spring
semester, students must enroll at the University of
Georgia (UGA) and take 3 courses; two in intensive
elementary Mandarin Chinese and a laboratory course
in genetics. No prior experience with Chinese language
is required, although students should have had at least
a course in introductory biology and preferably courses
in ecology and evolutionary biology.The cost to the student of the summer program is mini-
mal: the grant covers travel to and within China, lodg-
ing and most meals. The student is responsible for
health insurance, visa costs and personal expenses. Stu-
dents are also responsible for the costs of enrolling at
the University of Georgia for all required courses (12
credit hours) (all students are charged in-state tuition
rate plus fees).
Applications for the 2011 program are available
on our website: http://www.genetics.uga.edu/pire/-
undergrad.html . We encourage any interested students
to contact Dr. Mauricio for more information (mauri-
cio@uga.edu).

versity of Michigan *
*EPID 788 Evolutionary Epidemiology (1 credit hour)
Randolph Nesse *New applications of evolutionary
theory to medicine are growing and helping to ex-
plain apparent paradoxes, such as rapidly increas-
ing rates of breast cancer, increased asthma vul-
nerability in certain populations and the metabolic
syndrome (For details see The Evolution Network
athttp://evolutionandmedicine.org ). Epidemiologists
have begun to apply these principles and ask new
questions, such as do genes that vary by lati-
tude explain hypertension, and how might public
health interventions for infectious disease be ’evolution-
proofed’ (see discussion of the American College of
Epidemiology 2008 meeting: Dawn of Evolutionary
Epidemiology ( http://acepidemiology.org/meetings/-April 1, 2010 EvolDir 115
2008Tuscon/08AMSpeakerHandouts.asp ). This course
will explore how epidemiologists and other public
health workers can make use of these advances in their
own work. Applying evolutionary theory can sharpen
research questions, raise new possible explanations for
observed phenomena and identify new types of expo-
sure and outcome measures. Pre-requisite: No prior
training in evolutionary biology is assumed.

Course description:
Currently, the simplest Bioinformatics analysis uses
species comparisons in order to hypothesise the func-
tion of a novel biological sequence. Moreover, in most116 EvolDir April 1, 2010
Molecular Biology labs, evolutionary and phylogenetic
concepts are constantly being used with more or less
formality: homology, similarity, evolutionary rates,
long branch attraction, rooted and unrooted trees,
monophyletic group, molecular clock, adaptation, lin-
eage eﬀects, neutralism, cladograms, phylograms, etc.
The course aims to provide the necessary background
to understand the basic concepts from comparative and
evolutionary biology that are frequently used in molec-
ular biology and bioinformatics analyses.
The course consists in ﬁve full-day sessions with an
adequate balance between theory and computer prac-
tice, oriented to solve frequent problems and hypoth-
esis testing. The program covers the basic and ad-
vanced analysis of Phylogenetic reconstruction, Phy-
logenomic analysis of genomes and Maximum likeli-hood tests for molecular adaptation. The software re-
sources that will be used in the practical sessions in-
clude: Phyml, Phylip, MEGA, TreePuzzle, MrBayes,
PAML, Modeltest-Protest, Jmodeltest and the Phyle-
mon web server.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
AfterwordApril 1, 2010 EvolDir 117
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
