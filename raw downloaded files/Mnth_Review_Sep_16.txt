We are pleased to announce a symposium on the Genet-
ics of Adaptation.
Our goal is to bring together a broad representation of
evolutionary biologists, geneticists and developmental
biologists who study the evolutionary drivers and ge-
netic and developmental mechanisms of key adaptations
in nature. Participants will be evolutionary biologists
who study the genetics and developmental biology of
adaptations, or geneticists and developmental biologists
whose work informs ideas in population genetics and
evolutionary theory/genomics. Together, we will aim to
synthesize recent developments in evolutionary biology,
population genetics, ecological genetics, evo-devo, and
developmental tools and genomics technologies, which
have fueled explosive growth in understanding molecularSeptember 1, 2016 EvolDir 3
genetic and developmental bases of adaptations even in
non-model organisms.
We invite advanced PhD students, postdocs and young
faculty to submit abstracts for oral and poster presen-
tations. Abstract submission deadline: 15 September

OpenU EmergenceOfLife Nov3-4
Dear Colleague
This is just a gentle reminder requesting your attendance
at our the 3rd NoR HGT & LUCA meeting entitled:
'The landscape of the emergence of life' being held on 3-4
November 2016, at the Open University, Milton Keynes,
UK. The meeting has now begun to take shape, whichyou can check on our website: www.nor-hgt-luca.com.
If you wish to give an oral presentation please let me
have the abstract pertaining your talk. In the event you
are unable to attend, please pass this information on to
your colleague(s) who may wish to attend. I also attach
a conference poster for your kind attention.
Finally, I thought you might like to know the tone of
the conference this year. Some of the highlights so far
are:(1) Prof Avshalom C Elitzur, Israel, who will be
talking about non-living 'phenomena' in nature that
sort of reect life, (2) Dr Mukesh Bhatt, UK, discussing
the very thought provoking, legal denition of life; both
these invitees are intended to inspire scientists to think
'out-side the box' so to speak. A third speaker (Prof
Helen Hansma, USA) will be talking about clays, RNAs
and has an interesting and a dierent take on the origin
of LUCA from the normal run of the mill stu. Also
coming are the eminent speakers: Profs Peter Gogarten
(LUCA and HGT) and Andrew Pohorille (proteins)both
of NASA and Dr Michael Galperin (comparative ge-
nomics and the LUCA), USA; Prof Giuseppe Battaglia
(vesicles and biomembranes specialist) of UCL, UK and
there is also a mathematical treatment to life, delivered
by Dr Claudio Maccone of Italy.
I look forward to hear from you, whether the answer is
yes or no.

of weevils (The 2016 International Weevil Meeting) held
immediately after the International Congress of Ento-
mology (ICE) in Orlando, FL, on Oct. 1-3, 2016. The
meeting will be of broad interest to insect evolutionary
biologists and systematists interested in plant-herbivore
systems, especially those working on beetles. General
topics covered will include macroevolution and ecology,
biogeography, phylogeny, morphology, and classication.
It will consist of a series of invited and contributed
talks, and organized discussions of research priorities,
goals and methods. Beyond catalyzing new evolutionary
and systematics research and collaboration, we seek to
provide a forum for identifying priorities and goals for
the community of researchers/students who study or
otherwise have an interest in weevils, and in identifying
areas of research of broader interest to evolutionary biol-
ogists interested in plant herbivores and host-herbivore
interactions.
Pre-registration for the 2016 International Weevil Meet-
ing will close at the end of the day on Friday, 26 Au-
gust 2016. On-site registration will be available on the
evening of Sept. 30, on a rst-come, rst-served basis
(space permitting). Registration is free, but space is lim-
ited, so please register as soon as possible. If you havealready submitted your registration, a space has been
reserved for you. A nal program for the meeting will be
sent to registered participants via email in September.
Please feel free to forward this email to students and
colleagues who may be interested in attending.

Dear all,
The registration for the PAG meeting is open: In-
ternational Plant & Animal Genome XXV - http:/-
/www.intlpag.org/ - January 14-18, 2017 - San Diego,
CA, USA
This meeting is among the largest for non-human
genomics globally (thousands of attendants; including a
genomics technology fair). Much of it is about plant
and animal breeding but over the last few years there is
a growing community of Ecology and Evolution sessions
with hundreds of attendants across sessions. Last year
we successfully hosted a session about non-model avian
genomics (\Avian Genomics - Going Wild!") which
was well perceived. Please have a look at the speakers
and topics of #PAGXXIV: https://pag.confex.com/-
pag/xxiv/meetingapp.cgi/Session/3531. And here for
reference the overall workshop list of #PAGXXIV:
https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxiv/meetingapp.cgi/-
Program/1051 . The conference starts on Saturday,
14th January. On the Friday 13th we will do a
pre-conference birding tour around San Diego for
everyone who is interested (not only the speakers!!).
If you are at PAG and can't give a talk, please be in
touch about the birding tour nonetheless.
In our Avian Genomics workshop we seek to present cur-rent states of *omics in ecology and evolution of birds,
as broadly as possible. I herewith invite contributions
from the community for giving a talk. Please send your
abstract of 200-300 words to me until 27th August.
Feel free to forward to approach me with questions.
Very best regards, Robert Kraus

The origin of odorant receptors in insects
A PhD position is available to study the origins of a
unique family of receptors for odorants and pheromones
that arose early in the evolution of insects. Supported
from a grant from the prestigious Marsden Fund, theSeptember 1, 2016 EvolDir 11
PhD project will address the timing and role of the rst
insect odorant receptors. Our hypothesis is that they
appeared just before the origin of insect ight and ex-
panded to ll roles in detecting food, predators and/or
mates in this new three dimensional environment. The
research will involve the isolation of candidate odorant
receptors from the transcriptomes and genomes of early
insects and their deorphaning in surrogate cell systems.

The Hendry lab at Cornell University is recruiting Ph.D.
students to study host-microbe interactions. Specic
research projects are exible and dependent on the stu-
dent's interest.
The Hendry lab uses comparative genomics, molecular
evolutionary analysis, and ecological studies to under-
stand bacteria-host interactions in a variety of systems.
Much of the current work in the lab is focused on the
interaction of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae
and hemipteran insects such as aphids. P. syringae is
a common plant-associated bacterium and is also fre-
quently found in numerous other habitats such as in
precipitation and lakes and rivers. In addition to occu-
pying diverse environmental niches, these bacteria can
infect and kill a number of hemipteran insects. We are
interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying
this interaction, as well as the evolutionary and ecologi-
cal outcomes for both the bacteria and insects, and the
ecological and population dynamics of these partners in
complex interspecic interactions and across habitats.
Other ongoing projects include understanding genome
reduction and the evolution of obligate host dependence
in the luminous symbionts of marine sh, and investi-
gating transmission and function of insect microbiomes.
For more information, see the lab website (https://-
micro.cornell.edu/people/tory-hendry).
The lab is located in the Department of Microbiology
and interacts with researchers across Cornell, particu-
larly those working on symbiosis, insect-microbe inter-
actions, and plant-pathogen interactions. Cornell has
a vibrant and diverse community of researchers in the
biological sciences, with particular strengths in microbi-
ology, insect-microbe and insect-plant interactions, and
host-microbe interactions more generally.

PlantConservationGenetics
A MSc position in evolutionary and ecological conserva-
tion genetics is available to study local adaptation of the
perennial native prairie plant, Prairie Smoke with Jill
Hamilton at North Dakota State University in Fargo,
North Dakota.
Identifying the appropriate seed sources for restoration
eorts can be challenging, particularly for geographi-
cally isolated populations where historical isolation or
contemporary fragmentation may have contributed to
dierentiation in adaptive traits across a species range.
In this project we are investigating the genetic basis
of adaptation in Prairie Smoke (Geum triorum) plant
populations. Prairie Smoke is an herbaceous perennial
that has a wide geographic distribution spanning much
of contemporarily fragmented midwestern prairies, but
it is also common to disjunct alvar habitats around the
Great Lakes region. Alvar habitats are characterized
by thin layers of soil over limestone that harbor unique
assemblages of plants that are largely isolated from the
core of their continuous range.
The ideal MS student will be prepared to conduct eld-
based research in a common garden experiment that
has been established in Minnesota, with an opportunity
to expand locations. There is plenty of room to pursue
particular interests in adaptive trait variation depending
on the interest and experience of the candidate. The
student will also be involved in outreach activities asso-
ciated with the project engaging local state and NGO
stakeholders in applied research.
For more information on the Hamilton Lab please

between telomere dynamics, individual characteristics
and life history traits in a small passerine bird, the
House Sparrow (Passer domesticus). The Centre for
Biodiversity Dynamics will host the position.
We are seeking a highly qualied candidate with a back-
ground in either evolutionary, behavioral or population
ecology or eco-physiology. It is an advantage if the
candidate has laboratory experience in genetic analyses.
The aim of the PhD project is to investigate centralquestions related to the functional associations between
telomere dynamics, physiological variables, and how
these are associated with trade-os between life history
traits such as growth rate, body size, reproduction and
lifespan.

interested in recruiting a Ph.D. student, to begin in Fall
2017, to develop a dissertation project that focuses on
the molecular basis of coevolution between venomous
snakes and their prey. The student would be part of
a group conducting collaborative research to identify
the genetic, protein and functional basis of the traits
that mediate interactions between rattlesnakes and their
mammalian prey in an ecological context (for example,
see Holding et al. 2016. Proc R Soc B 283:20152841)
with the specic focus of the dissertation being exible
depending on the research interests of the student. The
student would also have the opportunity to be involved
in a recently-awarded NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity
grant on snake venom evolution that involves collabora-
tions between institutions in the US and Brazil.
The ideal applicant would have prior research in popula-
tion genetics or molecular ecology, molecular laboratory
skills, strong quantitative skills and prociency or inter-
est in learning basic bioinformatics. Field experience
with vertebrates would be benecial. A Master's degree

EvoDevoRegulatoryEvolution
Graduate position:
UBasel.EvoDevoRegulatoryEvolution
The Laboratory of Regulatory Evolution (Tschopp
group) at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel,
is hiring for two fully funded PhD positions.
Our research interests focus on two main questions: 1.
How is phenotypic diversity generated during vertebrate
embryogenesis? And 2.
how can developmental processes be modied to drive
morphological evolution? We are particularly interested
in investigating how the evolution of gene regulation is
underlying these phenomena. As a model system, we
are studying the development of the vertebrate skeleton
with its associated neuromuscular system.
In a rst project, we will investigate the gene regu-
latory networks underlying the generation of skeletal
cell types, originating from distinct embryonic sources18 EvolDir September 1, 2016
and in dierent species. This will allow us to assess
the developmental and evolutionary constraints on gene
regulation during cell type specication. Secondly, we
are interested how cell specication and embryonic pat-
terning are intertwined. To this end, we will study the
specication of synovial joints during the embryonic
outgrowth of digits, a process contributing important
aspects of the patterning diversity seen in the hands
and feet of vertebrates.
Both projects build on solid foundations of conrmed
preliminary data.
For more information please visit http://-
evolution.unibas.ch/tschopp/research/index.htm
We will address these questions using a range of
experimental methods, including embryology in
chicken, mice and sh; functional genomics (RNA-seq,
ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, STARR-seq); cell culture and
viral gene delivery; genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9);
bioinformatics and in silico modeling.
Successful candidates will have a background in molecu-
lar and/or developmental biology, and ideally will have
a basic understanding of Unix and the R language for
statistical computing.
Please send your application with a brief statement of
motivation, a current CV and contact(s) for references
(where applicable) to patrick.tschopp@unibas.ch Evalua-
tion will begin on Sept. 1st 2016 and suitable candidates
will be contacted shortly after.
The University of Basel is an equal opportunity employer
and encourages applications from female candidates.

search Foundation) funded PhD position (65% TVL
E13) at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,
Germany. We are looking for a highly motivated stu-
dent to study communication and foraging in ants. The
project investigates foraging strategies in ants that use
tandem running as a recruitment strategy (mainly Tem-
nothorax and Pachycondyla). The research will include
experimental work in both laboratory and eld (includ-
ing eld trips to Brazil) and a possibility to combine
empirical work with simulation modeling.
We are looking for a candidate with a Masters degree
(or equivalent) in Biology and a strong background in
behaviour, ecology or evolution. Good English skills
and an ability to work independently and as part of
a team are important. Experience with social insects,
statistical or modeling methods and a knowledge of Ger-
man are helpful but not a requirement. The working
language of the laboratory is English. The Johannes
Gutenberg-University Mainz is interested in increasing
the number of women in science. Applications from
women are therefore strongly encouraged. Similarly,

urbanisation-phd-scholarship About the research
Urbanisation is driving some of the most dramatic and
swiftly occurring environmental change across the globe,
and cities - as epicentres of development - present ex-
tensive new challenges for wildlife. In my research lab
we used the native eastern water dragon to study the
mechanisms of adaption to city life.
In the last few years, my research lab and I have gath-
ered mounting evidence that eastern water dragons are
undergoing rapid contemporary evolution within the
city of Brisbane. We are now uniquely placed to under-
stand what it is about city life that drives this extensive
divergence. As such, this phd project could focus on a
variety of research topics and as such students interested
in the following subject should apply: ecology, animal
movement, physiology, ecology and/or genomics.
My research lab uses longitudinal life-history datasets
on wild populations comprising behavioural, spatial andgenetic information to understand how free-living ani-
mals evolve in the wild. In particular, we aim to shed
light on how environmental and social factors inuence
evolutionary processes.

About the research
The Frere lab's specialises in Ecology, Genetics and
Behaviour (http://celinefrerelab.com/).
The Detection Dogs for Conservation program (http:/-
/www.usc.edu.au/DDC) is a new and energetic team
that uses highly trained detection dogs to study animals
in the wild. The research project will focus on three
primary questions: 1) determine whether rehabilitated
land can provide safe koala habitat and thus maintain
healthy population; 2) what ecological factors are key
to successful rehabilitation in the context of koala; and
3) can we map and predict where rehabilitation would
have the highest positive impact for koalas?
The project will require the student to have a driving
licence given that the project will include heavy eld-
work (4wd to access sites). The student will be trained
in the handling of trained detection dogs, performing
ecological surveys, collecting scats, undertaking molec-
ular work of scats for genetic and disease information,
mapping and analysing in ArcGIS, as well as extensive
statistical analyses and publication writing.

and Fungal Trees of Life, a major piece of global sci-
ence infrastructure that is central to RBG Kews Science
Strategy 2015-2020. This is a unique opportunity to be
part of a team addressing a critical challenge in the life
sciences. Are you up to the task? If so, read on to nd
out more.
You will contribute directly to the one of the most ambi-September 1, 2016 EvolDir 37
tious outputs of RBG Kews Science Strategy, the Plant
and Fungal Trees of Life (PAFTOL) project, which
aims to reconstruct complete genus-level phylogenies of
plants and fungi. As a team member of the PAFTOL
project, you will be involved in the development and
implementation of a variety of cutting-edge techniques
including the next-generation sequencing pipeline that
will be used for PAFTOL.
The project
There are few grander challenges in science than the
tree of life - uncovering the complete evolutionary his-
tory linking all life on Earth. As part of RBG Kews
Science Strategy 2015-2020, we are initiating a ve-year
multimillion-pound project, the Plant and Fungal Trees
of Life (or PAFTOL, for short), to complete the tree of
life for all genera of plants and fungi, drawing on our out-
standing collections, our broad collaborative networks
and the latest high-throughput sequencing technologies.
This ambitious project will create a unifying framework
for comparative plant and fungal research and takes us
a step closer to building the tree of life for all known
species. We will generate high impact ndings publish-
able in top science journals, but we want the results to
reach beyond the science community. To achieve this
we will build innovative big-data and visualization tools
accessible to a scientist or a school child. This is a truly
exciting time to join Kew and become an integral part
of a high-prole, cutting edge global endeavour.
The team
You will join a team of specialists with a wide range of
skills, which forms part of Kews Department of Com-
parative Plant and Fungal Biology in the Science Di-
rectorate. You will report to the PAFTOL Senior Re-
searcher and coordinator and work in collaboration with
the team in charge of the Molecular Biology labora-
tory. Your tasks will include sourcing and preparing
samples, conducting molecular biology lab work (e.g.
DNA extraction, DNA quality control, library prepara-
tion for DNA sequencing), operation and maintenance
of equipment, applying appropriate health and safety
procedures, and working closely with other sta or vol-
unteers. It will also include training sta, students and
visitors in specialist techniques, when required.
The Role
You will have a BSc degree-level or equivalent in an ap-
propriate subject and knowledge of current research
in plant and/or fungal molecular systematics. You
will have skills in relevant laboratory techniques in-
cluding DNA extraction, PCR, DNA sequencing, high-
throughput sequencing technologies, and relevant com-
puter programs. You will possess training skills andexperience of writing and presenting scientic data. You
will be a team player who can manage conicting prior-
ities and work on your own initiative.

The organisation
The Loro Parque Fundaci on (LPF) is a private foun-
dation, created in 1994 and legally registered in Spain
as a charitable-status entity. It is a conservation NGO,
and member of the International Union for the Con-
servation of Nature - IUCN. Its HQ is located at Loro
Parque in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Although
it has no national or regional branches, it operates at
international level and is represented in many countries
through its project partnerships with organisations in
those countries.
Its recent average annual spend directly on projects, of
which there are 36 active in 2016, is US $1 million. It
is the owner of, and manages the world's largest, most
diverse collection of Psittaciformes. The collection is a
genetic reserve and resource for research and exhibition
for education, as well as generating part of the income
of the LPF. The private company Loro Parque is its
principal sponsor, covering all operating costs so that
100% of all other donations go directly to the projects.
The larger proportion of projects is for the conservation38 EvolDir September 1, 2016
of threatened species of parrots, each project including
to a lesser or greater extent the direct protection of the
target species, the protection and restoration of habi-
tat, and the cooperation with and integration of the
local community into the conservation eort. The LPF
has increasing involvement in projects related to the
conservation of the marine environment, in particular
with whales and dolphins. More recently, the LPF is in-
volved in the conservation of large terrestrial mammals
in central southern Africa.
The LPF has a Board of Trustees (President, Secretary
and Vocals) which has ultimate responsibility for its
governance. An international advisory board meets an-
nually with the trustees and principal sta to review
progress and make recommendations about project sup-
port. There are also honorary vice-presidents.

server (in the same spirit as phylogeny.fr) that will pro-
vide a comprehensive set of relevant methods to (i) infer
species trees from gene trees, that is, the supertree prob-
lem, (ii) reconcile gene trees and species trees and (iii)
develop solutions to graphically represent combinations
of evolutionary events along species trees (speciation,
duplication, loss, lateral transfer).
The skills needed will of course depend on the project
selected by the candidate (see above). The list provided
below is only indicative and should not prevent highly

SpecialColumn
This is an announcement for submission of papers to
a special column in behavioral toxicology. This special
column has relevance to evolutionary biologists study-
ing evolutionary outcomes of anthropogenic exposure
to pollutants on behavior.
|{
We are excited to announce a special column in the
journal of Current Zoology in behavioral toxicology and
behavioral ecotoxicology. We are calling for the sub-
mission of papers for this special column. We welcome
papers evaluating behavioral endpoints of toxicological
exposure at the physiological-, organismal-, population-,
ecological-, and evolutionary-levels, as well as phylo-
genetic and conservation approaches. Please see the
Current Zoology announcement below for more infor-
mation.
Questions? Contact one of the guest editors for more
information: Dr. John Swaddle (jpswad@wm.edu)
or Elizabeth Peterson (epeterson@albany.edu or eliz-
abethkpeterson@gmail.com).
Call for Papers: Conservation Concerns in Behavioral
Toxicology
Website: http://cz.oxfordjournals.org/page/-
specialcolumn Guest Editors: Dr. John Swaddle
(jpswad@wm.edu), Dr. Elizabeth Peterson (epeter-
son@albany.edu)
Behavioral toxicology (also known as behavioral teratol-
ogy) is the study of how anthropogenic pollutants alter
behavior, and is an emerging eld of global importance
to both conservation and public health. The disciplines
of behavioral toxicology and teratology have made great
strides in understanding how human pollution disrupts
behavior and contributes to disease. Although great
emphasis in the eld of toxicology has been placed on
understanding how single pollutants aect individual
phenotypes, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach
that includes animal behavior is essential to address how
anthropogenic compounds are risk factors for species and
population survival in an increasingly polluted world.This special column will address issues in behavioral
toxicology using the framework of Tinbergen's four ques-
tions to understand how pollutants aect behavior in
terms of causation and mechanisms, development and
ontogeny, function and tness, as well as evolutionary
history and phylogenetic patterns. The goals of this spe-
cial column are to: 1) address the issue that behavioral
toxicology is relevant and important when assessing
the conservation and preservation of populations, 2)
provide a framework for the study of the evolution of
behaviors, and 3) identify areas of behavioral toxicology
that require further attention to facilitate the future of
behavioral toxicology as a discipline within both the
behavior and toxicology elds.
Deadline for title submission: September 1, 2016;
Deadline for manuscript submission: November 1, 2016.
Special Column Publication: April, 2017.
A title should be sent to the guest editors and
manuscripts should be submitted before the deadline.
Manuscripts received after the deadline will be consid-
ered as submissions for regular issues.
Submitted papers should not have been published pre-
viously, nor will be under consideration for publication
elsewhere. Submitted manuscripts are accepted with
the understanding that they are subject to peer review
and editorial revision.

EvolutionJournal ScienceWriting
Science writing (in evolution!) opportunity for trainees!
Are you a PhD student or postdoc in evolutionary bi-
ology and want an opportunity for some practice with
science writing?
The agship journal EVOLUTION anticipates launching
a new online section called \Digests", which will feature
highlights of and insights from published research arti-
cles in a brief and less-technical form, somewhat akin
to a \News & Views" story. Digests will be short ( ~500
words) and linked from the landing page of the research
article to maximize visibility.
If you are a trainee interested in contributing a Digest
to the journal, please let us know so that we may pro-
vide you with more detailed information for how to
contribute and how to see what articles are available on
which to write.
Turn a summary of your journal club presentation into
a publication! Or if you're a faculty member teaching
a graduate science writing course, have your students
get practice that also helps them begin a portfolio of
published writing.
To be added to an e-mail list to receive more information,
please write to evolutiondigests@gmail.com . Please do
NOT reply to this e-mail. Thank you!

AmphibianAdaptation
We are looking for an assistant to conduct amphibian
monitoring from mid-January to mid-June 2017. The
main task will be the weekly count of breeding individ-
uals at up to 30 sites in South Korea. The project aims
at assessing the eects of climate change on the breed-
ing phenology of toads (Bufo gargarizans), Brown frogs
(Rana uenoi), Gensan salamanders (Hynobius leechii)
and Suweon Treefrogs (Dryophytes suweonensis). This
project is under the responsibility of Pr. Jang Yikweon60 EvolDir September 1, 2016
from Ewha W. University, Seoul, South-Korea.
The successful assistant should have a very strong inter-
est in amphibians and/or climate change, and general
ecology. In addition, he/she should be a good driver,
as the monitoring requires long driving hours from site
to site. Experience with amphibians and willingness to
learn very basic Korean will be appreciated.
The assistant will be involved in several projects but
will also have the possibility to develop her/his own
project. This project does require a heavy time com-
mitment, at times when humans, and amphibians, are
usually socially active. This project is recommended to
recently graduated bachelor or Master students, looking
for the next step in their scientic cursus. Anyone elseinterested is also welcome to send an inquiry email.
Flights to and from Korea will be at the expense of
the assistant, but the lab will be providing nancial
assistance covering boarding and food.

Job description:
A Post-Doctoral fellowship is now open for applications
at ICETA (CIBIO-InBIO) - Reference ICETA 2016-75
in the context of the Project \Using network theory to
predict risk of invasion" (PTDC/AAG- GLO/0463/2014
e POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016583) granted by national
funds by FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) and co-funded by
FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for
Competitiveness Factors (POFC)- COMPETE.
Background:
Biological invasions are one of the greatest globalSeptember 1, 2016 EvolDir 65
changes now underway. Human translocation of species,
either intentional or not, is mixing the world's biota
and while the majority of transported species fails to
establish in the new areas, some eventually become inva-
sive. Invasive species are now a main cause of important
declines in biological diversity, of economic and pro-
ductivity losses in human enterprises and of large-scale
changes in the spatial distribution of human and ani-
mal diseases. The current number of known invasive
species worldwide already reaches the tens of thousands
and the increase of this number is strongly associated
with the increase in the extent and volume of trade and
transport. Consequently, as globalization ensues, it is
expected that the number of invasive species and the
magnitude of their impacts becomes even higher.
Research environment:
The postdoc will be associated with Lu ~As Reino in
the Applied population and community ecology labo-
ratory in Lisbon (http://maerua.iict.pt/applecol/) led
by Prof. Pedro Beja, which will co-supervise the
work. The successful candidate will also be actively
involved with the CIBIO-partners at the University of
~A^Avora in the group led by Prof. Miguel B. Araujo
(www.maraujolab.com), particularly the other candi-
date that will be contracted under this project. This
project also involves collaboration with a cohort of inter-
national scientists including Riccardo Scalera (IUCN),
Daniel Sol (CSIC), David Richardson (Stellenbosch Uni-
versity), Diederik Strubbe (University of Copenhagen),
Jose Tella (Estacion Biologica de Donana- CSIC), Mar-
tina Carrete (University Pablo de Olavide), Jonathan
Jeschke (Berlin-Brandenburg Institute of Advanced Bio-
diversity Research), among others.
Required background and skills:
Two alternative proles are suitable for this post:
Prole 1 - PhD in Mathematics or Physics. Solid skills
in applied modelling of network-related dynamics. Good
programming skills are a must. Strong motivation for
working in ecological problems is highly appreciated.
Prole 2 - PhD in Biology, Ecology and related elds.
Solid background in dispersal ecology with proven expe-
rience in environmental modelling, numerical analysis
of ecological data and macroecology. Good program-
ming skills are a must. Proven knowledge of network
dynamics is highly appreciated.
Language:
English as a rst or second language is required.
Publication record:
Candidates are expected to have a good publication
record in internationally refereed journals.Working Plan:
The successful candidate will work mainly on the devel-
opment of risk models for bird invasions. The modelling
is expected to be spatially and temporally explicit and
will use available data on networks of bird trade and
other appropriate environmental and socio-economic
predictors.
Legislation framework:

kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/index.php/Main Page) at
Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, is seeking a
postdoctoral fellow to develop new bioinformatics tools
for metagenome data analysis. The increasing frequency
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pathogenic
bacteria is creating new challenges for diagnosis and
treatment, and rapid assessment of new cases is essential
to support immediate public-health and therapeutic
interventions.
The main objective of the project is to support rapid
and precise identication of AMR genes in metagenomic
data. Central to these eorts will be the development
of software that can rapidly screen large metagenomic
datasets for a target set of genes by taking advantage of
new algorithmic approaches, and apply rigorous statis-
tical ltering methods to identify probable AMR genes.
The project is part of a larger initiative involving
the McArthur group at McMaster University, and the
Brinkman group at Simon Fraser University. Advances
in the project will be used to augment the Comprehen-
sive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD: https://-
card.mcmaster.ca/) and applied to emerging genomic
epidemiology data.
The following skills and experience are essential for the
position:
* Software development, preferably in C/C++/Python
* Experience with metagenomic data analysis, includ-
ing quality control, homology search, and taxonomicSeptember 1, 2016 EvolDir 69
/ functional assignment * Other bioinformatics tech-
niques such as sequence alignment and phylogenetics
* Familiarity with reference databases * Peer-reviewed
publications in metagenomics
The following skills would also be assets to the position:
* Experience with microbial genomics * Ecient com-
putational techniques such as k-mer decomposition and
other string-related algorithms * Knowledge of mech-
anisms of AMR * Statistical sequence representations

PlantAdaptationResilience
Multiple postdoctoral positions are currently available
for research on plant resilience to abiotic and bioticSeptember 1, 2016 EvolDir 71
stresses in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) at
Michigan State University. The successful candidate(s)
must be highly motivated, have a track record of leading
publication in peer-reviewed journals, and have prior
experience with research in one or more of the following
areas: 1) statistical analysis of large environmental and
genomic data sets, 2) genome assembly and annotation,
3) eld experiments for QTL mapping, 4) ecophysiology
of plant responses to heat and drought, 5) analysis of
complex RNA-seq data sets, and/or 6) metagenomic
analyses.
Research Program Description: The goal of the research
will be to utilize evolutionary principles to identify the
genetic basis of important adaptive natural variation
within bean for tolerance to various stresses. Common
bean is one of the most important food legumes grown
worldwide and one of the leading sources of protein in
Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Bean is also
an ideal system for answering basic research questions
in adaptation and speciation because it is a self-fertile
diploid with a comparatively small genome. Produc-
tion of bean is limited by drought, heat, and a suite of
pathogens. With global climate change, those stresses
are likely to become more intense, further hampering
the production of common bean worldwide. Innovative
approaches to improve germplasm are now needed make
common bean more resilient to stress and ensure success
across a variety of ecoregions worldwide.
The research will leverage extensive resources available
for bean, including large fully genotyped GWAS panels,
numerous advance generation hybrid populations, and
extensive data sets from eld trials across Africa, the
Caribbean, and North America. The successful postdoc-
toral candidate(s) will benet from an ideal environment
at Michigan State University, which includes >150 plant
science faculty and a strong community of ecologists and
evolutionary biologists (https://eebb.msu.edu/). The
research program is sponsored by the new Plant Re-
silience Institute at MSU (http://research.msu.edu/-
plant-resilience-institute/), which includes world lead-
ers in plant genomics and stress tolerance. Research
will be further enhanced by partnerships with leading
bean breeders and the Legume Innovation Lab at MSU
(http://legumelab.msu.edu/).
To Apply: Interested candidates should send a CV, a
research statement, and contact information for three
individuals who can provide letters of recommendation
to David Lowry (dlowry@msu.edu). The research state-
ment should be brief but include a description of past
research accomplishments, current research interests,
and future career goals. Please feel free to send an

MNHN Paris Biogeography
#### Postdoctoral position in macroecology and bio-
geography at the MNHN, Paris, France ####
The Mus eum national d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN,
Paris) invites applications for a full-time 2-year post-
doctoral position in macroecology and biogeography of
phytophagous insects.
The MNHN is a world-class research institution that
aims to document and understand global and local bio-
logical and ecological diversity, disseminate the results
of these studies to a broad academic and non-academic
audience, and contribute to high-level education at all
stages of the curriculum. The position will be based
within the Institute for Systematics, Evolution and Bio-
diversity (ISYEB UMR 7205 CNRS, MNHN), a research
unit hosting more than 90 researchers whose investi-
gations address questions in systematics, evolutionary
biology and ecology, biogeography and macroecology
on a variety of non-model organisms in all kingdoms of
Life.
The successful applicant will work under the supervi-
sion of Dr. Rodolphe Rougerie as part of the research
program ACTIAS (http://www.cesab.org/index.php/-
en/projets-en-cours/projets-2014/130-actias), funded by
the Center for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity
(CESAB). One of the main objectives of the ACTIAS
project is to carry out a global-scale macroecological
analysis of two of the best-documented families of moths
(Sphingidae & Saturniidae), highlighting areas where
species diversity and evolutionary distinctness are con-
centrated and most threatened. It will represent the
rst such analysis on a global scale for a diverse group of
invertebrates ( >4500 species; see Ballesteros et al., 2016
[doi: 10.1111/ecog.02438] for an example of what has
recently been achieved by members of our consortium
on Old-World Sphingidae species), made possible by the
wealth of existing diversity, distributional, ecological
and phylogenetic information available for these moths,
including an almost comprehensive species-level DNA
barcode database.
The ACTIAS program is run by an international consor-72 EvolDir September 1, 2016
tium of 12 researchers (see link above for a list) from ve
countries. Working under Dr. Rougerie at the MNHN,
but in close collaboration with the other members of the
ACTIAS consortium, the postdoc will: (1) develop and
implement the pipeline for the construction of Species
Distribution Models (SDMs) for all databased species;
(2) carry out macroecological analyses of relevant mea-
sures of diversity (e.g., species richness, evolutionary
distinctness, phylogenetic diversity); (3) compare these
patterns with those already existing for plants and ver-
tebrates; (4) analyze their t to current conservation
measures, rarely critically examined for invertebrates;
and (5) contribute to a synthesis of macroecological
patterns and eco-evolutionary analysis of diversication
in these moths. The postdoc will lead the assembly
of manuscripts in collaboration with members of the
consortium and also participate in and contribute to
the organization of four consortium meetings (two in
2017 and two in 2018) at the CESAB headquarters in
Aix-en-Provence.
#### Qualications ####
We are seeking applicants holding a PhD degree in ecol-
ogy, macroecology, biogeography or related discipline
(e.g., conservation biology, evolutionary ecology), with
a solid theoretical background and a strong publication
record in these elds, proven expertise in applied and
spatial statistics, and with a keen interest in global
patterns of insect diversity and in ecological model-
ing. The ACTIAS database will collate distribution
records that have or lack DNA barcodes and will be
hosted within the Barcode of Life Datasystems (BOLD;
www.boldsystems.org). The postdoc will develop R
scripts and pipelines that can be implemented within
the BOLD API system. We thus expect applicants to
have demonstrable skills in writing R scripts.
In addition, applicants should have: §Expertise in the
use of GIS for analysis and visualization; §Fluency in En-
glish, excellent communication skills and a willingness to
organize and lead workshops/meetings; §Experience in
presenting and communicating results at international
conferences and through publications in high-quality
peer-reviewed journals; §An excellent understanding of
biodiversity data management.
Desirable skills include an interest in insect diversity,
experience in participating in research programs that
analyze large datasets, and a broader coding aptitude
(e.g., Python) that would facilitate the integration of
analytical pipelines in the BOLD API system.
#### Conditions of employment ####
We oer a fully funded, two-year fellowship of 2500
euros/month (gross salary, health insurance included).#### Application procedure ####

as model mammalian systems.
2. To characterize and quantify the spontaneous muta-
tion process in murid rodents by genome sequencing of
related individuals recently sampled from the wild.
The Postdoc will also have the opportunity to work
on another related component of the project, the long
term consequences of spontaneous mutation for quantita-
tive, life history and behavioural traits and for genomic
variation in highly replicated spontaneous mutation ac-
cumulation experiments with inbred mouse lines.
Applicants should have or will shortly obtain a PhD in
a relevant subject, which could be population genetics,
evolutionary genetics, molecular evolution or quantita-
tive genetics.
Within the project, there will be opportunities to de-
velop independent lines of research related to evolu-
tionary genomics with a view to establishment as an
independent investigator. The grant includes substantial
funds for computing, sequencing and to attend inter-
national conferences. There will be the opportunity to
travel to the Max Planck Institute in Ploen to collabo-
rate with colleagues there. The position is for 3 years

cell and comparative genomics. The research is centered
on understanding the phylogeny and molecular evolu-
tion of uncultured and poorly known fungi, including
the Cryptomycetes, Zygomycetes, and Chytridiomycetes
through genomic analyses. The ultimate goals of the
project are to produce a well-resolved phylogeny of the
basal branches of the fungal kingdom, to identify key
evolutionary events associated with diversication and
reproduction, and to use genomics to predict ecological
roles of uncultured lineages. A major component of the
work will be to develop or improve methods for sequenc-
ing fungal genomes and transcriptomes using single or
few cells or genome assembly using metagenomic ap-
proaches. This work will involve collaborations with the
ZyGOLife research network (zygolife.org) and the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI). The projects are supported by
NSF and two JGI Community Sequencing Projects.
The ideal candidate will be skilled in bioinformatics,
molecular biology, and microbiology with an interest
in fungi. Preference will be given to candidates withprociency in both bioinformatics and molecular biology.
Possible duties include environmental sampling, cell sort-
ing (FACS, micromanipulation), microscopy, genome
assembly and annotation, and comparative analyses of
genome evolution. Opportunities for mentoring under-
graduates or research associates will be provided. The
initial appointment is for one year with a possibility of
extension to a second year pending performance review.
Our lab (www.umich.edu/ ~mycology) pursues diverse
projects in mycology, and the environment is con-
ducive to development of a pathway to independence
in academic research. The lab is in the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (http:/-

A 18 month postdoc position in statistical phylogenet-
ics is available at the University of Montpellier (UM),
France. The successful candidate will join the \Meth-
ods and Algorithms in Bioinformatics" group and work
in close collaboration with other Montpellier-based re-
search teams (see above for more information about the
personnel involved).
The project relies on Bayesian sampling techniques that
map mutations on phylogenies [1]. These approaches are
very relevant from a biological [2,3] and a computational
[4] perspective. However, we believe that their full po-
tential has not been reached yet. In particular, applying
novel data exploration techniques to visualize mutation
maps should help us improve our understanding of the
ne scale mechanisms governing molecular evolution.
The postdoc candidate will thus develop original infor-
mation visualization methods that will provide relevant
summaries of the mutational process. The proposed
techniques will also detect episodes of evolution that are
not well predicted by our Markov models of evolution.
Applications of these new visualization techniques are
manifold. Adaptive evolution and biased gene conver-
sion are associated with peculiar substitution patterns
that mutation maps could potentially help identify. Sim-
ilarly, errors in sequence alignment and/or improper or-
thology relationships are expected to generate atypical
maps. Lastly, preliminary analyses of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis genomes demonstrated how mutation maps
can help recover the series of mutations leading to an-
tibiotic resistance. The successful candidate will further
develop one or several of these research leads.
The ideal candidate for the proposed project will have
a PhD in statistical phylogenetics or population ge-
netics, although pure statisticians and physicists with
strong interest in molecular evolution should also apply.
Good skills in data analysis with modern tools and pro-
gramming languages (R and/or Python and/or Java or
C/C++) are essential.
Please send CVs and inquiries to Stephane Guindon
(guindon@lirmm.fr).

AvianEvolutionaryGenomics
Post doc position in avian evolutionary genomics A re-
search position funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (ERC-Starting Grant) is available at the research
group of Jochen Wolf at the Division of Evolutionary
Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Ger-
many. The position is initially limited to two years with
the possibility of extension for another two years after
evaluation.
{Background{ Recombination is a central biological pro-
cess with important implications for adaptation, speci-
ation and, more generally, genome evolution. Theory
predicts that recombination modulates the ecacy of
selection and will impact the distribution of genetic di-
versity and divergence across the genome. This project
will utilize state of the art sequencing technology to
leverage information from population-scale processes
bearing on linkage disequilibrium and meiosis at the
level of individuals to infer ne-scale (recombination)
genetic maps in several avian species. Our primary fo-
cus lies on the genus Corvus where we have access to
several high-quality genome assemblies. The integration
of recombination information with extensive population
re-sequencing data (1, 2) and transcriptome data (3)
will help elucidate the evolutionary processes acting dur-
ing early and later stages of species diversication. In
addition, comparative genomic analyses extending the
framework beyond the level of the genus have the poten-
tial to disclose the contribution of recombination to the
remarkable syntenic conservation of avian genome. In
that, the project will contribute to our understanding
of how population-level processes may translate into
long-term evolution.
{Qualications{ The successful applicant holds a PhD
degree, has an excellent track record with a thorough
background in population genetics and/or comparative
genomics, and is skilled in analyzing large genome-wide
data sets.
{Research environment{ In our research group we apply92 EvolDir September 1, 2016
an integrative approach to explore micro-evolutionary
processes and genetic mechanisms underlying species
divergence, adaptation and genome evolution. Using
large-scale genetic approaches, as well as eld based
experiments, we characterize genomic divergence across
populations and (sub-)species and assess its relationship
to phenotypic divergence (4)- sometimes with an ap-
plied angle (5, 6). In addition, we engage in comparative
approaches to study evolution across larger timescales
(7). Empirical systems include natural populations of
birds (swallows (8) and corvids (1-3)), marine mam-
mals (pinnipeds and killer whales) (9, 10) and, recently
added, the European hemiclonal water frog system and
ssion yeast. The group is currently transitioning from
Uppsala University to the University of Munich. In-
formation on our activities can be found at http://-

coding of Herbivore Diet
A three year position as postdoctoral research fellow
available at Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Syn-
thesis (CEES), Department of Biosciences.
Project description
We generate DNA based diet data and study species
and human interactions of the reindeer - one of the
last remnants of the Beringian megafauna in the Arctic,
keystone species, with high cultural and economic value
for indigenous residents. Using DNA metabarcoding
we analyze geographic, climatic and seasonal patterns

settings. We will study diet overlap and infer trophic
interactions with other herbivore species in the Arctic,
such as geese, ptarmigan (Svalbard) and rodents (Finn-
mark). Our study will test whether reindeer diet changes
correlate with warmer/longer summers or variation in
population density. We integrate this ecosystem-based
information with socio-economic data and local knowl-
edge of reindeer herders to apply adaptive governance
for developing co-management actions and implemen-
tation of alternative reindeer husbandry practices and
mitigation measures for climate and/or land use change.

Department of Biosciences, Faculty of Mathematics and
Natural Sciences, University of Oslo (Norway). The
Postdoctoral fellow will be part of a large-scale inter-
national project (Size-dependent anthropogenic pertur-
bations - from genes to ecosystems and back) nanced
by the Norwegian Research Council in which we will
explore eco-evolutionary feedback loops induced by size-
dependent selection in the medaka Oryzias latipes.
The position will be aliated to CEES
(www.cees.uio.no), a national centre of excellence
(CoE), situated at the Department of Biosciences,
University of Oslo. The appointment is for a period
of three years, including experimentations in Paris,
France. The successful candidate will integrate an
outstanding international research consortium gathering
ecologists, molecular physiologists, bioinformaticians
and geneticists in Norway and France: the Weltzien
lab at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences
(http://weltzienlab.com/), the Institute for Ecology
and Environmental Sciences of Paris at Universit e
Pierre et Marie Curie (https://ieesparis.ufr918.upmc.fr/-
?lang=fr), and the Laboratory for Evolution, Genomes,
Behaviour and Ecology of CNRS in Gif sur Yvette
(http://www.egce.cnrs-gif.fr/?lang=en).PROJECT DESCRIPTION Anthropogenic pertur-
bations are disproportionately impacting large-sized
species and individuals at the top of food webs, and
result in cascading eects in ecosystems. These trophic
cascades are caused not only by a decrease in top-
predator densities, but also by an adaptive change to-
wards smaller body sizes in top predators. Whether and
how anthropogenic trophic cascades induce a change
in the natural selection that acts back on body size
(i.e., an eco-evolutionary feedback loop) remains largely
unknown. The goal of the 3-year postdoc project is
to experimentally explore whether and how such eco-
evolutionary feedback loops operate in medaka and pond
food webs.
Specically, we will measure the cascading eects of fast-
and slow-growth medaka lines in outdoor tank ecosys-
tems under both bottom-up (enrichment) and top-down
(presence/absence of medaka predators) perturbations,
and whether and how natural selection acting back
on medaka body size is dierent among the selected
medaka lines and perturbation types. The postdoc will
(i) contribute designing the protocols, (ii) supervise the
experiments including sampling the dierent ecosystem
compartments and medaka tness metrics, enumerate
invertebrate samples, and (iii) analyse and model the
data.
REQUIREMENTS Applicants must hold a PhD-degree
(or other corresponding education equivalent to a Nor-
wegian doctoral degree) and document solid experience
in ecology and evolution. The candidate will work in
close collaboration with the rest of the project team and
it is expected that the candidate will stay for about 6
months periods with the collaborating institutions in
France.
We are seeking a highly motivated and hard working
postdoctoral candidate that will be able to manage a
large pond experiment, enumerate plankton and benthos
samples, analyze and model data, and publish articles
in high-ranking journals. A high sense of organization,
experience with aquatic ecosystem experiments, and
data analysis (R programming language and statistical
modeling) are particularly appreciated.

Dear EvolDirers,
I'm looking for a quantitative mind to write in as a
1-yr postdoc (initially) in a NERC research project ex-
amining the eciency of certain buering life history
strategies of dozens of UK animal and plant species at
dealing with the projected increase in temperature of
1.5 C in the UK in coming decades. This position is
to be coadvised by myself and Dylan Childs at Univer-
sity of Sheeld (ranked 3rd in the UK in Biological
Sciences). The position would start October 1st 2016.
Candidates must evidence a strong publication record
(normalised by time to or since PhD graduation), exper-
tise in population models (e.g. matrix models, IPMs,
IBMs), quantication of environmental drivers, and
analyses and programming in R... a bit of comparative
biology would not hurt either. Please help us spread
the word. Interested candidates are to email me directly
(r.salguero@sheeld.ac.uk) ASAP, but before Aug 15th,
with a CV and one-page statement of academic interests.

INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR BIOLOGISTS
http://prstatistics.com/course/introduction-to-python-
for-biologists-ipyb-3/ This course is being delivered by
Dr Martin Jones, an expert in Python and author of
two text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/-
dp/1492346136/] Advanced Python for Biologists
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/] . Due to high demand
a repeat of this course will run from 3rd - 7th October
2016 at Malham tarn eld centre, Yorkshire, North of
Manchester, England.
Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable lan-
guage that is a popular platform for all types of bioin-
formatics work, from simple one-o scripts to large,
complex software projects. This workshop is aimed at
complete beginners and assumes no prior programming
experience. It gives an overview of the language with an
emphasis on practical problem-solving, using examples
and exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinfor-
matics work. After completing the workshop, students
should be in a position to (1) apply the skills they have
learned to tackle problems in their own research and (2)
continue their Python education in a self-directed way.
Intended audience:
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. Teaching
format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and whatintrons and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum: Day 1: Module 1 - Introduction Module 2
- Output and text manipulation
Day 2: Module 3 - File IO and user interfaces Module 4
- Flow control 1: loops
Day 3: Module 5 - Flow control 2: conditionals Module
6 - Organizing and structuring code
Day 4: Module 7 - Regular expressions Module 8 -
Dictionaries
Day 5: Module 9 - Interaction with the le system
Module 10 - Optional free afternoon to cover previous
modules and discuss data

Course Description For many of its history, our knowl-
edge of evolution has been based heavily on theoretical
models and hypotheses. In the age of novel experimental
and technological approaches, we are now increasingly
able to evaluate this theory; however, the basics of how
and why to develop and analyse a simple model are
often forgotten in the process of NGS analysis. This
course aims at training evolutionary biologists in classi-
cal modelling and teach them ways to approach their
own research questions through evolutionary theory.
Primarily through interactive hands-on sessions, com-
plemented by an introduction to the cornerstones of
modelling and its application to data analysis, this
course will familiarize the participants with ways of
approaching a research question with a simple model,
and dierent strategies at gaining insight from the model.
In groups of two, course participants will develop and
analyse their own toy model in the course and present
their ndings to the group on the last day. Topics that
will be covered in the course include the following:
Why and how are models useful? How to write
down/develop a model How simple/complicated should
a model be? Which modelling approach/programming
language should I use for my question? How to nail
down a question with a model Extracting results from
an equation/simulation How to evaluate a model using
empirical data
Participants can use their preferred programming lan-guage during the hands-on sessions, and free access to
Wolfram Mathematica will be provided. The instruc-
tors have modelling experience using Mathematica, R,
Python, and C++.

-AIMS and OBJECTIVES
The goal of our 5-days workshop is to bring together
an outstanding group of experts that develop concep-
tual, theoretical and experimental approaches to study
the ecological genomics of coevolutionary interactions.
These instructors will introduce workshop participants
to modern concepts, models and methods that are widely
being used or are currently being developed. The rst
four days of the workshop will consist of lectures and
practical demonstrations given by the instructors, fol-
lowed by hands-on exercises performed by the partici-
pants under guided supervision. The lectures will focus
on current topics and latest developments relevant for
investigating ecogenomics of coevolutionary interactions(see program: inferring co-demographic histories and
testing for co-adaptation). Participants will focus on
datasets provided by the instructors in the light of new
developments. On the fth day, thematic talk sessions
with presentations from invited speakers and selected
participants will illustrate current research on the eco-
logical genomics of coevolution. In order to enhance
discussions during the ve-day workshop, we will also
ask participants to present a poster of their own work on
the rst day to introduce themselves and their research
topic.
-PROVISIONAL PROGRAM
Day 1: Computational methods to infer co-demographic
histories using genomic data, Dr. Aurelien Tellier (Cen-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
