Recognized international scientists in the evolution and
medicine will be gathered in the 15th edition of the
Centre for Genomic Regulation Symposium that will
take place in Barcelona on the 6-7 of October under the
title \Evolution & Medicine" in Barcelona, Spain.
This open meeting will provide a unique opportunity
to bring together researchers and scientists to explore
topics in cancer evolution, the emergence of resistance
to antibiotics and other drugs, the origin and evolutionJune 1, 2016 EvolDir 3
of pathogens, and the evolutionary inuence on our own
construction and predisposition to various diseases.
Evolutionary theory forms the basis for our understand-
ing of the natural world. The development, behaviour
and physiology of our own species has been shaped by
million of years of evolution. Furthermore, the inter-
action of humans with species that directly aect our
health and survival is constantly being modied by evo-
lutionary forces through natural or articial selection.
Registration is now open to the scientic community
and can be done through the CRG Symposium website
until September 16th. Participants are invited to submit
their abstracts, a number of which will be selected for
short talks.

Conference related to the Programming for Evolutionary
Biology course
When: September 9th - 12th 2016 Location: Belgrad,
Serbia
Registration now open
Detailed information about the conference content and
how to register: http://pebconference.info/ The Pro-
gramming for Evolutionary Biology (PEB) conference
brings together scientists broadly interested in apply-
ing bioinformatic tools to answer evolutionary and eco-
logical questions. It aims to serve as a platform for
discussing common programming pitfalls encountered
during research and features workshops to further de-
velop participants' bioinformatic abilities. This year,
we are fortunate to be joined by an outstanding list of
Plenary Speakers.
The conference is an oshoot of the Programming for
Evolutionary Biology course held annually at the Uni-
versity of Leipzig. The course teaches the essential
background skills required to perform computational
analyses using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data
with a focus on solving research questions related to
genomics and evolution. Alumni from the Class of 2014
organized the inaugural PEB conference in May 2015
at CIBIO (Vila do Conde, Portugal) in order to discuss
their research and overcoming technical challenges. The
conference was a spectacular success and so this year
the PEB community is pleased to announce that we
will be accepting applications from the broader public!
We welcome all speakers interested in the application
of NGS methods in ecological and evolutionary studies.
The second PEB conference will be held from September
7th to 12th, 2016 in Belgrad, Serbia.

has reached the point where deriving the sequence of
an organisms entire genome is now seen as a begin-
ning rather than an endpoint. The sequence itself is
a powerful tool to guide further studies to achieve an
understanding of the organisms biology. This under-
standing requires either a detailed genetic analysis, or
more rapid methods for developing functional genomics.
Therefore, this years meeting will cover micro-organisms
for which extensive analyses exist, and those for which
new biological and technical strategies are being de-
veloped. The focus on biodiversity, the human micro-
biome, pathogenic organisms, and bioenergetics adds
special signicance to this meeting. This meeting is
designed to have a mix of invited presentations and
poster sessions. The meeting will have approximately
150 participants. Since attendance is limited, please

Dear all,
We have the pleasure to announce a CNRS-Jacques
Monod Conference entitled \Evolutionary genomics and
systems biology: bringing together theoretical and ex-
perimental approaches" that will take place in Rosco
(France) from 10 to 14 October 2016.
Deadline for abstract submission (mandatory for par-
ticipation to a Jacques Monod Conference): 22 June
2016 (see instructions on CNRS website http://-
www.cnrs.fr/insb/cjm/2016/Vekemans e.html) The or-
ganizers: Xavier Vekemans (UMR Evo-Eco-Pal eo, Lille;
xavier.vekemans@univ-lille1.fr) and Christian Landry
(Institut Biologie Int egrative et des Syst emes, Laval
University, Qu ebec; christian.landry@bio.ulaval.ca)
Presentation of the conference: Genomic tools are be-
coming essential in biological investigations that relate
to agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and biodiversity
science. Moreover, evolutionary concepts and an evolu-
tionary genomics perspective are becoming central to
interpret any new nding in these elds and develop for-
ward approaches for problem solving. The potential of
evolutionary genomics is unparalleled as it provides key
insights into our understanding of many fundamental
and applied questions such as the evolutionary history
of life on earth and the molecular bases of adaptation
of species in response to environmental changes in nat-
ural populations and crop improvement. However, the
maturation of evolutionary thinking in these elds in-
volving genomic approaches is an ongoing process and
needs to be supported by initiatives that will update
key analytical, conceptual and experimental innovations
in evolutionary genomics.
The objective of the proposed conference is to make
such synthesis possible by bringing leaders in the eld
together to discuss their ongoing research and vision of
where the eld is moving over the coming years. Accord-
ingly, we aim at fostering the link between functional
and evolutionary perspectives towards an integrative
approach of evolutionary genomics, and propose a con-
ference with: two sessions on evolutionary systems biol-
ogy and experimental evolution; one session on genome
evolution; two sessions on theoretical and empiricalpopulation genomics. Because evolutionary genomics
largely focuses on processes (how mutations arise and
x in populations) and systems biology on functions
(how mutations are translated into phenotypes), we are
convinced that this combination will allow to progress
towards a better understanding of evolutionary pro-
cesses and its applications. Besides this focus on an
integrative approach, a second aim of the conference
is to bring together evolutionary genomic researchers
working on a large panel of organisms, from bacteria
to humans, including e.g. plants and fungi, in order
to foster the cross-exchange of evolutionary concepts,
analytical methods and experimental approaches.

Dear colleagues and friends, we are happy and proud to
announce that the interdisciplinary symposium 'NET-
WORKS IN BIOLOGY' will take place October, 12th-
13th 2016 at the Georg-August-University G ottingen,
Germany.
Networks are a common theme in all biological processes.
Since the organization and structure and thus the func-
tion of biological networks can rarely be studied directly,
dierent specialized approaches such as mathematical
modelling, empirical studies or the combination of those
are being developed in various biological disciplines. The
main aim of the 'NETWORKS IN BIOLOGY' sympo-
sium is to bring researchers of dierent research elds
together to reveal commonalities of dierent biological
networks and overlaps in the used methodology.
Invited Speakers: DAMIEN FARINE (MPI for Ornithol-
ogy, Konstanz, Germany) MARC TIMME (MPI for Dy-
namics & Self-Organization, G ottingen, Germany) JO-
HANNES JAEGER (Konrad-Lorenz Institute, Vienna,

BielefeldU GalapagosSeaLions
Graduate position, Bielefeld University, Galapagos Sea
lions
A PhD position to study individual behaviour and the
ensuing consequences at the population level in Galapa-
gos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) is available in the
Department of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University
from August 1st 2016 or soon thereafter. The position is
available for three years and is funded by Departmental
funds with a gross salary of ca. 1300 eper month.
We seek a bright and highly motivated student who has
a proven record of eld experience studying wild animals.
A very good Master degree or equivalent in a relevant
topic (e.g. animal behaviour, behavioural ecology, pop-
ulation ecology, evolutionary ecology) is expected. The
ideal candidate will be able to work both independently
and as part of a multidisciplinary team, will have expe-
rience with both statistics and genetic techniques and,
in addition to excellent spoken and written English, will
be able to speak Spanish.
The study will take place on Caama~ no, a small
islet in the Galapagos archipelago. We have stud-
ied Galapagos sea lions there since 2003 and most
sea lions are individually marked (www.uni- biele-
feld.de/biologie/animalbehaviour/trillmich/sealions.html).
Field seasons on Caama~ no last from September-
December and February-March each year. Caama~ no is
a small island and there are no facilities at all, so an
ability to work in truly primitive conditions is essential.
The successful candidate will be based at the De-
partment of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld Univer-
sity (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/animalbehaviour/-
home.html) and will be supervised by Oliver Kr uger,
Fritz Trillmich and Joe Homan. The department is the
oldest of its kind in Germany and currently hosts ve
principal investigators, ve postdocs and fteen PhD
students. It oers a stimulating international environ-
ment and an excellent research infrastructure including
a brand new molecular laboratory. The working lan-
guage of the Department is English. Together with the
Evolution and Animal Ecology research groups housedin the same building, there are some 50 scientists and
PhD students from over ten dierent countries working
on related topics in behaviour, ecology and evolution.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with all ex-
pected amenities and easy access to the Teutoburger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It oers a
high standard of living and is well connected to most
major European cities.
To apply for the position, please provide: (i) a letter
of motivation including a 1-2-page statement of your

LundU MaternalEectsEvolution
A 4-year PhD position is available in the laboratory of
Tobias Uller at Lund University, beginning September
2016.
The aim of the project is to test the theoretical pre-
diction that parental eects can facilitate adaptation
to novel environments, and that natural selection can
convert stress-induced parental eects to adaptive mech-
anisms of information transfer in variable environments.
The research project will study the mechanisms and
adaptive functions of non-genetic inheritance of toler-
ance to biotic or abiotic stressors in water eas, Daphnia,
using a combination of eld- and lab-based experiments.
These involve eld sampling, large experimental set-ups
and a suite of molecular methods, including analyses
of gene expression and its epigenetic regulation. It is
expected that the PhD student will actively drive the
direction of her/his research and there is thus intentional
exibility within the project to encourage theory-driven
research. To this end, we oer excellent training in
evolutionary theory and in the generation and analyses
of molecular and phenotypic data at Lund University
and through our international project partners.
This research is funded by, and is part of, a > $8 million
multinational grant from the John Templeton Founda-
tion involving 49 investigators and 8 leading academic18 EvolDir June 1, 2016
institutions. The research is designed to examine the
role of development in evolution. The project is led
by Kevin Laland and Tobias Uller (http://synergy.st-
andrews.ac.uk/ees/the-project/).
Successful applicants will be engaged in this research
project, and so should have a very strong interest in
evolutionary biology - in particular the relationships
between development, ecology, and evolution. The can-
didate should also have good knowledge and practical
experience of experimental research on invertebrate lab-
oratory model organisms. An understanding of aquatic
ecosystems and zooplankton biology are desired qual-
ications, and experience of work with algal or Daph-
nia cultures, DNA sequence analysis and programming
(within bioinformatics) are an additional merit. We are
looking for someone who is enthusiastic, creative, good
at problem-solving, a team-worker, independent, and
demonstrate excellent personal organisation skills and a
strong work ethic.

EvolBacterialSymbiosis
The evolution of bacterial symbiosis with eukaryotic
hosts
Background
Over the past 2 billion years, symbiotic unions with
microbes have resulted in key innovations that have
largely shaped the evolution of complex organisms. Host-
microbe symbioses have produced some of the most im-
portant evolutionary transitions, including the origins
of the eukaryotic cell, the mitochondria and chloroplast.
In addition to these ancient symbiotic events, bene-
cial microbes play important roles in many aspects of
host biology, such as in development, defence against
pathogens and in nutrition.
The aim of this PhD project is to use the symbiotic
bacteria of aphids to understand how benecial rela-
tionships with microbes form and what causes them to
transition from being non-essential, or facultative sym-
bioses, to permanent obligate associations where both
symbiont and host depend on each other for survival.
The research will combine experiments with modern
molecular techniques to test fundamental questions on
how bacterial symbioses evolve.
First we will explore the role of benecial microbes in
insect adaptation. We previously demonstrated that the
facultative symbionts of the pea aphid have helped this
insect colonize new ecological niches, such as food-plants
and climatic regions. These same facultative symbionts
are horizontally transferred between many dierent in-
sect species and we currently do not know what insect
species share symbionts between them and how commu-
nities of insects use symbionts as a resource when adapt-
ing to new environments. This project will specically
address: i) which insect species share symbiont isolates
between them, and ii) test if hosts equally benet from20 EvolDir June 1, 2016
access to adaptations carried by dierent bacteria. This
has important implications for the horizontal transfer
of adaptive traits between host species that could allow
for rapid evolution to new environments.
The second project will investigate the evolution of obli-
gate symbioses. This is where symbionts transition from
being non-essential to the host to becoming obligate
permanent associations where the host and bacteria rely
on each other for survival. We have identied several
facultative symbionts that we hypothesize have tran-
sitioned to permanent obligate associations in many
dierent aphid species. Using genomics and compara-
tive methods we will test several key hypotheses on what
conditions facilitate these evolutionary transitions and
determine how symbiont and host genomes respond to
the early stages of forming permanent symbiotic bonds.
This project will reveal the ecological conditions that
stabilize host-microbe symbioses and establish this sys-
tem as a model for studying this important evolutionary
process.
Based on outcomes of the above research the student will
be encouraged to develop and test her or his own ideas
and hypotheses on the evolution of bacterial symbiosis.
Skills required
- Past experience with either molecular biology and/or
genomics is essential
- Strong understanding of evolutionary theory
- Experience cultivating plants and herbivorous insects
is an asset
- Basic statistical knowledge
Funding Notes
The student will have a strong 1st class degree, or a
MSc degree (or about to nish a MSc degree). The stu-
dentship will cover tuition fees and provide an annual
tax-free maintenance allowance for 3 years at Research
Councils UK rates ( ^A £16,054 in 2016/17). Interviews
will take place at Queen Mary and will be announced
in July.

UAlabama InvertebrateSystematics
The newly formed Kocot lab in the Department of Bio-
logical Sciences at The University of Alabama seeks a
highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD student inter-
ested in invertebrate systematics.
The successful applicant is expected to have an inter-
est in combining traditional morphological approaches
(e.g., scanning electron microscopy and histology) and
cutting-edge molecular approaches (e.g., transcriptome
and whole genome sequencing, anchored hybrid enrich-
ment, and bioinformatics) in the study of the diversity
and evolutionary history of invertebrates. Signicant
experience with at least some of the aforementioned
approaches and a passion for invertebrate zoology are
required.
Ongoing projects in the lab primarily seek to improve
understanding of the phylogeny and evolutionary ge-
nomics of Mollusca. Research by the incumbent may
leverage the PI's extensive collections of aplacophoran
and scaphopod molluscs (among other taxa) and newly
sequenced draft mollusc genomes to address questions
ranging from alpha taxonomy to phylogeny to compara-
tive and evolutionary genomics. I also welcome studentsJune 1, 2016 EvolDir 21

MammalConvergentEvolution
Hi,
We invite applications for a PhD position funded by the
European Research Council (ERC) for 36 months at the
University of Montpellier (France).
The ConvergeAnt project: morphological convergence
and dental simplication in ant-eating placentals.
Co-supervisors. Dr. Lionel Hautier

Teams \Paleontology" and \Phylogeny and Molecular
Evolution"
Background. Despite its widespread occurrence across
the tree of life, many questions still remain unanswered
concerning the fascinating phenomenon of convergent
evolution. Our objectives with this project are to pro-
vide new insights on a textbook example of adaptive
evolutionary convergence represented by mammalian
myrmecophagous species, in which similar phenotypes
evolved independently in several lineages. The acquisi-
tion of a myrmecophagous diet almost exclusively com-
posed of ants and/or termites has indeed evolved inde-
pendently in ve placental lineages with armadillos (Cin-
gulata), anteaters (Pilosa), aardvarks (Tubulidentata),
pangolins (Pholidota) and aardwolves (Carnivora). The
skull of myrmecophages has attracted considerable at-
tention because they show an extreme dental reduction,
reaching its paroxysm in anteaters and pangolins that
totally lack teeth. The selective constraints imposed by
this highly specic diet have driven the convergent evolu-
tion of numerous morphological, anatomical, and phys-
iological characters resulting in similar morphologies
in these animals. We propose taking advantage of the
unique set of convergently evolved characters associated
with the ant-eating diet to investigate the developmental
mechanisms underlying phenotypical adaptation.
Tasks. The main objectives of this PhD are to revealJune 1, 2016 EvolDir 23
the details of the morphological convergence towards
skull elongation and dental reduction observed among
independent myrmecophagous lineages. The successful
candidate will address the following questions: (i) How
is the skull variation shaped by convergent evolution
towards myrmecophagy? (ii) Can we characterize the
developmental origin of dental reduction? (iii) Can we
identify a set of convergently evolved characters dening
the myrmecophagous phenotype?
Candidate prole. Mandatory requirements include a
master's degree in evolutionary biology, experience in
working with vertebrate collections, a high degree of
initiative and motivation, capacity for teamwork, good
English skills, and good knowledge of statistics applied
to geometric morphometrics. Skills and experience with
CT scanning and 3D reconstruction techniques will be
useful. Desirable is a background in vertebrate compar-
ative anatomy and evolution, especially in mammals.
Skills in myology would also be useful. The success-
ful candidate will have a genuine interest to interact
with molecular biologists. S/he should also be keen to
travel to visit international museum collections for data
collection during the course of the Ph.D.
Applications. Candidates must send electronically their
application before June 20th, 2016 in the form of a sin-
gle PDF le including a cover letter, a CV, eventually
a copy of their Master thesis, and contact information
(not supporting letters) of two persons of reference to
lionel.hautier@univ-montp2.fr and frederic.delsuc@univ-
montp2.fr. We will review applications upon receipt.
Short-listed candidates will be interviewed the last week
of June.
This PhD position forms part of the ConvergeAnt
project funded by the European Research Council
(ERC), which aims at investigating the complex in-
terplay between the mammalian genome, phenome, and
associated microbiome in a classical case of adaptive
convergence driven by a highly specialized diet.
Starting date: 01/10/2016
Duration: 3 years

PhD Research Fellowship in Mycology/Microbiology
available at the University of Oslo, Norway24 EvolDir June 1, 2016
Most fungi reside in natural habitats, but some species
have expanded their habitats into buildings, causing
adverse health eects as well as damages to the con-
structions. The main aim in this project is to improve
the knowledge about indoor fungal communities (i.e.
the indoor mycobiome) by implementing state-of-the-
art high throughput DNA sequence (HTS) analyses.
Using DNA metabarcoding and other DNA based ap-
proaches we will analyze the spatiotemporal variation
in the indoor mycobiome within single buildings and
on broader geographic scales and identify the main de-
terminants of the indoor mycobiome. We also want to
improve reference DNA sequence collections for indoor
fungi and improve and adapt existing bioinformatics
tools for DNA metabarcoding analyses of the indoor
mycobiome.
The fellowship will be for a period of 4 years, with 25%
compulsory work. Starting date no later than 01.10.2016.

Summary: Insect pollinators are currently facing a
strong decline that threatens agricultural productions,
ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity. Its major
causes are well understood but its consequences remain
largely unknown, mainly because of the high complexity
of the plant-pollination interaction networks and of sev-
eral methodological diculties. The aim of this project
is to use NGS techniques and metabarcoding tools to
study plant pollinator interactions in several more or
less anthropized environments. The objectives are: - To
describe in details (in terms of quantity and composi-
tion) the pollen loads on the insects and on stigmas in
order to infer the sign, the strength and the symmetry
of the pollination links in both the plant and the in-
sect communities (direct interactions) but also between
the dierent plant species (indirect interactions) within
the community, by using metabarcoding and NGS; -
To reconstruct and to model pollination interactions
at dierent levels (infra-specic, functional groups) in
order to understand how they vary in structure and in
functioning.
This study was started in the EDB lab in

Applications are invited for a fully funded; three-year
studentship based at the Institut de Recherche sur la
Biologie de l'Insecte (IRBI), at University Fran cois
Rabelais, Tours (France) and co-supervised by Elisabeth
Herniou and Carlos Lopez-Vaamonde. You will be
part of an international project (CLIMTREE) funded
by the French National Research Agency (ANR) and
BELMONT FORUM. https://www.belmontforum.org/-
funded-projects/climtree-ecological-and-socioeconomic-
impacts-climate-induced-tree-diebacks-highland This
international project involving French, German, Italian
and Chinese teams aims to investigate the ecological
and socioeconomic impacts of climate-induced forest
die-os in several mountain ranges. The student will
visit other labs for training and will benet from
interaction with three other newly recruited PhD
students within the consortium.
*Background* Climate change aects mountain forests
by increasing the intensity and frequency of disturbances
such as drought, insect and pathogen outbreaks, re,
wind and ice storms. As a result widespread tree mortal-
ity has been reported in recent decades. Most mountain
forests support a rich community of organisms, so the
loss or replacement of any tree species implies a change
in species composition and a nancial and economic cost.
Understanding which species are lost and which are re-
silient to these environmental changes is crucial in order
to take reasoned management decisions for mitigation.
*Objectives* To study the impact of climate change

Call for expression of interest: applications for
'Funda c ~A £o para a Ci^ encia e a Tecnologia' PhD grants
2016: the role of hybridization on evolutionary rescue
through an experimental evolution approach
We are looking for students interested in applying for a
PhD grant for the next 'Funda c ~A £o para a Ci^ encia e a
Tecnologia' (FCT) call (June 15 ^th-July 15 ^th)
We are a dynamic team at the Centre for Ecology, Evo-
lution and Environmental Changes (cE3c: Reseacrh
Grupo 'Evolutionary Ecology, subgroup 'Local Adapta-
tion in Drosophila), analysing the real-time evolution
(by experimental evolution) of Drosophila subobscura
populations adapting to a novel (laboratory) environ-
ment, since foundation from natural populations - see
details of our research at
http://ce3c.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/teams/prole/-
sub.php?idT The research plan will involve the
role of hybridization in the evolutionary dynamics of
populations derived from contrasting natural locations
(extremes of the European cline), when a adapting to
a novel (laboratory) environment. Previous studies
of our team have shown that populations adapt
fast. Moreover we showed that populations highly
dierentiated at the start clearly converge at the
phenotypic level, particularly for tness-related traits
(Fragata el al. PLoS One 2014, Evolution 2016), though
not at the karyotypic (chromosomal inversions, Fragata
et al Journal of Evolutionary Biology 2014) or the
genome-wide level (manuscript in preparation).
Building on this knowledge, we will now question
whether hybridization between populations with con-
trasting biogeographic history aects the adaptive dy-
namics, during evolution to a similar, new environment.
Particularly, will hybrids adapt faster than parental pop-
ulations, contributing to evolutionary rescue, a hot topic
both in evolutionary and conservation terms? Will hy-
bridization lead to the evolution to a dierent adaptive
peak, suggesting a complex, rugged landscape? Prefer-
ence (though not being a necessary condition) will be
given to candidates with some experience in Experimen-
tal Evolution, as well as the maintenance of laboratory
populations of Drosophila The details of the research
plan that will be submitted to the FCT call will be
discussed with the chosen candidate.
The grant involves in general a monthly payment of980 EUR plus social security (125 EUR); if part of
the project is developed abroad (involving a foreign co-
supervisor, with details to discuss) some of the monthly
payments will be 1710 EUR.
If you are interested in the topic, please send an email to
mmatos@fc.ul.pt, including a short cv and a motivation
letter until May 31 2016.
If you already have a PhD degree and you are interested
in the topic you may also express your interest, and an
application for a Post-doc grant will be discussed.

ExtractingDNA from RNAlater
answers
Dear All,
I posted the following question on EvolDir about a week
ago:
'Dear Colleagues,
I am attempting to extract DNA from RNAlater stored
tissue samples for downstream DNA methylation se-
quencing (MS-AFLP, MeDIP-seq).
I have tried several dierent extraction protocols: Qi-
agen DNeasy blood & tissue, Promega Wizard, Phe-
nol/Chloroform and a spooling protocol from Thermo-
Fisher specically intended for this type of DNA extrac-
tion. All of these extraction protocols I followed-up with
isopropanol precipitation to clean the extracts further.
Whilst I successfully extracted some relatively high qual-
ity DNA (when visualized on a gel), yields were lower
than expected. More worryingly the 260/230 ratios
were low (<1.2) suggesting that a lot of salts were be-
ing co-extracted alongside DNA. My main concern here
is that these salts could impede enzyme action during
restriction-ligation or PCR leading to problems with
reproducibility.42 EvolDir June 1, 2016
Has anyone had some success extracting DNA from
RNAlater stored tissue and would be willing to share
some tips/advice on how to carry these extractions out
successfully and cleanly?'
I received some excellent replies and also several requests
to post the replies. Please nd below the collated re-
sponses to my query in rough chronological order. Many
thanks to all those who took the time to help me with
my problem
Best wishes

Hi Alan,
I was asked this question recently by a colleague. As
was the case then, I have not actually tried to do this
myself, but came across the following when looking for
Chelex-based extraction protocols.
https://www.researchgate.net/post/-
Isthat possible toextract DNA using Chelex from RNALater preserved samples
Maybe this is of help? Or maybe is just another
version of what you've already tried.
Anyways, good luck!

Hi Alan,
WE had some issues before with RNAlater-preserved
samples. What we did was we washed our samples with
1x PBS to get rid of the salts. Our DNA quality and
PCR amplication was better afterwards.

Dear Alan,
We used a kit that should be analogous to the Qiagen kit
(silica based column), but we did not purify it further
(just followed the instructions of the kit). You can see
our results in the attached paper (gel in Figure 3- NAP
turns out to be the same as RNA later).
Good luck!

Dear Alan,
we have had a very good experience rinsing RNA-Later
xed samples in PBS (1X) before homogenization. We
do this for RNA extraction. If we use CTAB instead ofTrizol, we always recover very high quality DNA from
RNA-Later xed specimens and clean the DNA using
the Zymo Duet kit (this usually cause the DNA to break,
but we are only interested in RNA...).
How long, this we never tested. We ussually transfer
the sample from RNA-Later into PBS and wait for, say,
no longer than 5 mins before transfering the sample to
lysis buer.
Long ago, I read this PBS wash step helps getting better
RIN values, likely due to salt removal. Maybe it does
the trick.
cheers

Dear Dr. Hudson,
I have extracted DNA from tissues stored in RNAlater
using the classic Phenol/Choroform/Isoamyl alcohol
(PCI 25:24:1) protocol without any modication. Af-
ter extraction, there were huge white precipitates in
the tubes as I guess happens to you. Therefore, I per-
formed an extra step of cleaning-up with magnetic beads
(AMPure beads). After this clean-up I have used these
samples for RRBS and also specic PCRs after bisulte
conversion and everything worked ne.
If you need further details on the clean-up step, please
let me know.
Best regards,
Dafni Anastasiadi

Hi Alan,
re your evoldir question - Isopropanol tends to leave
more salts. I would use >95% ethanol to precipitate then
wash pellet with 70% ethanol to remove even more salts.
Personally I've never had a problem with RNAlater pre-
served tissue. Though I've only ever PCRed it, nothing
fancier. Secondly I've never been a big fan of 260:280
as a measure of quality. DNA not cleaned of salts can
both PCR and restrict just ne. Though you need to
check for yourself if it is in your experiment.
Cheers

Hey Dr. Hudson,
We extract DNA from microbes on lters stored in
RNAlater (or a homemade equivalent, anyway) all the
time. For us, the key is to rinse the lters thoroughlyJune 1, 2016 EvolDir 43
before starting the extractions. I don't know how easy
this would be for you if you have tissue samples, but we
just put the lters back in our ltering apparatus and
run a few hundred milliliters of ultrapure H2O through...
Hope you get your problem solved. Good luck!

PrairieDogConservation
Field Assistants Required - Black-tailed prairie dogs
Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada
We are looking for 3 volunteers to assist with eldwork
beginning June 15 and continuing until August 31 (pref-
erence may be given to applicants who can start earlier
in June). The project investigates the ecology, conserva-
tion and evolution of Black-tailed prairie dogs and will
involve live-trapping, handling and monitoring of indi-
viduals. Prairie dog towns are home to (among others):
burrowing owls, swift fox and, the recently reintroduced,
black-footed ferret. Assistants will have the opportunity
of seeing all of these iconic grassland species, plus the
many more resident in the Park.
This is an excellent opportunity to gain experience work-
ing with a population of wild mammals in a spectacular
setting and in collaboration with university, park and
zoo researchers. All eldwork is carried out in Grass-
lands National Park, southern Saskatchewan, one of the
largest remaining tracts of native prairie in Canada. We
will be staying in Parks Canada housing in the heart
of the park. Food and accommodation are provided.
Volunteers are required to provide for their own travel
to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Travel between the eld
station and Saskatoon is provided.
Training will be provided and no experience is necessary,
but candidates should have an interest in the following
(the more the better!): ecology, evolutionary biology,
wildlife, eld biology, and conservation biology. The
eld house and study population is isolated (the nearest
town is approx. 45 min away) and, as such, successful ap-
plicants need to be able to cope under these conditions,
enjoy the outdoors, be up-beat, positive, responsible
and work well as a member of a team.
If you wish to apply for one of these posts then please
send a CV with a cover letter and contact details for
three references (with e-mail addresses), by email toJe Lane (contact info below) ASAP. Applications will
be evaluated as they are received. While we thank all

Teaching Evolution videos
I am happy to report that the 3rd edition of my
textbook Evolutionary Bioinformatics (Springer, New
York) is now available: http://link.springer.com/book/-
10.1007%2F978-3-319-28755-3 . Since the second editionJune 1, 2016 EvolDir 45
(2011), accesses to the ebook have greatly increased.
This parallels the growing trend towards online courses
which supplement traditional educational approaches
and facilitate self-directed learning. These courses can
be much more than videos of formal lectures. The 'Khan
Academy' is an interesting example. The pen-tablet of
impresario Salman Khan captivates millions world-wide.
Students see multicolored drawings, arrows, numbers
and letters, moving across a black background to Khan's
melodious accompaniment. With pause and rewind op-
tions, they can proceed at their own pace.
While lacking Khan's eloquence - but one has to start
somewhere - I have experimented with his method, gen-
erating a series of 15 minute videos that explain evolu-
tionary principles in everyday terms and, it is hoped,
with a touch of humor. Rather than supplementing
the textbook, which has been extensively updated, the
videos provide an elementary introduction - primarily
directed at high school students and the general reader
(https://www.youtube.com/user/forsdyke1/playlists ).

VOLUNTEER FIELD ASSISTANT sought for 4-6
weeks starting immediately, to help with a study of
paper wasp (Polistes) behavioural ecology in southern
Spain. The work will involve helping a PhD student to
census and observe colonies as part of experiments to
elucidate the basis of helping behaviour in these wasps,
which live in small colonies of <20 individuals. The
successful applicant must be prepared to work hard
and have an interest in behavioural/evolutionary bi-
ology, and have enthusiasm and tness level suitable
for eldwork. Successful applicants will obtain excel-
lent experience of cutting-edge insect behavioural ecol-
ogy. A driving licence and any ability to speak Spanish
would be advantages, but are not essential. Because
the work involves recording colour marks on individ-
ual animals, the job would not be suitable for someone
who is colour-blind. See our research group website
for more information about the kind of work we do
(http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/eldlab/).
Air fare (from the UK or mainland Europe) and ac-

ClarkU PlasticityLedEvolution
Clark University: Post-doctoral fellowship in Plasticity-
Led Evolution
A post-doctoral position is available in the laboratory
of Susan Foster and John Baker at Clark University
in Worcester MA USA beginning September 1 2016 as
follows:
The idea that novel trait expression induced by environ-
mental change (phenotypic plasticity) could inuence
the course of evolution has re-emerged as a core issue in
evolutionary biology in recent years. A central question
associated with this issue is whether environmental in-
uences on plastic phenotypes accelerate evolutionary
rates by exposing previously cryptic genetic variation to
selection, or instead buer populations from evolution-
ary change by producing phenotypes that are adaptive
under the novel conditions. Assessment of these alter-
natives has proven exceptionally dicult.
Research in our laboratory, involving the unusual adap-
tive radiation of the threespine stickleback sh, Gas-
terosteus aculeatus, will evaluate these alternatives on
both phenotypic and genomic levels by examining pat-
terns of gene expression in relation to salinity challenge
in oceanic (ancestral) and derived (freshwater), post-
glacial populations in the Pacic northwest of North
America. Our primary, general goals are to understand
whether high levels of ancestral plasticity are associated
with accelerated evolutionary rates both at the levels
of individual candidate loci and in genomic regions of
divergence.
The successful candidate will participate in research
design, eldwork, bench work and, most importantly
bioinformatic analysis of Illumina sequencing data. |
We thus seek applicants experienced in Illumina library
construction and strengths in functional, evolutionary,
and population genomics who have an interest in un-
derstanding all aspects of the research from the natural
history of a remarkable adaptive radiation through anal-
ysis of the way in which plasticity of gene expression has
inuenced diversication in the radiation. Our intent,
in addition to obtaining signicant insight into the role
of plasticity in evolution, is to provide the post-doctoral
fellow with suciently broad background to carry a
signicant extension of this project into an independent
faculty career should the fellow choose to do so. The
fellow will also have the opportunity to add additionallines of inquiry related to the research.
This research is funded by, and is part of, a > $8 million
multinational grant from the John Templeton Founda-
tion involving 49 investigators and 8 leading academic
institutions. The research is designed to examine the
role of plasticity in evolution. The overall project is led
by Kevin Laland and Tobias Uller http://synergy.st-
andrews.ac.uk/ees/the-project/. Collaborators on the
Clark component of the research are William Cresko
(University of Oregon), John Gibbons (Clark Univer-
sity), Kevin Laland (St. Andrews University), Juha
Meril a (University of Helsinki), and Matthew Wund
(The College of New Jersey). The successful applicant
will have the opportunity to participate in workshops
associated with the research at Clark University
http://www.clarku.edu/articles/clark-university-
biologist-co-lead-87-million-grant-evolutionary-biology,
and also in the larger workshops associated with
Templeton Grant.
The position is available as early as September 1, 2016,
initially for a 2 year period. Salary is commensurate
with experience relative to NIH guidelines.
To apply, please submit a letter of application, a CV, a
statement of research interests and contact information
for three references to sfoster@clarku.edu. Review of

Villefranche-sur-Mer Developmental Biology Laboratory
in France (CNRS-UPMC), and the Brown Lab at the
Istituto de Bioci^ encias in Brazil (USP), will study the
evolution of regeneration, asexual reproduction, and
clonality in several species of ascidians (Urochordata),
and examine how ecological factors aect distribution
ranges, evolution of life cycles and developmental strate-
gies. DEVODIVERSITY has the following main aims:
1. To resolve the phylogenetic relationships and evolu-
tionary transitions between strict sexual reproduction to
budding and high regenerative abilities among Styelidae
(Ascidiacea). 2. To provide a coupled morphological
and ecological understanding of asexual propagation
(budding). We will generate detailed anatomical and
developmental descriptions of budding processes, and
explore if and which environmental conditions are asso-
ciated with the use of particular budding modes. 3. To
compare gene pathways involved in stem cell functions
or trans/de-dierentiation of budding and regenerative
processes by the generation and in silico analyses of
transcriptomic data. 4. To launch a comparative ge-
nomic approach study in order to better understand the
evolution of a major life history transition in marine
chordates, in particular the evolutionary transition from
sexual to asexual propagation.
The candidate will be mainly based at the LBDV (Ville-
franche sur Mer, France) and may have the opportunity
to do laboratory and eldwork in both countries.
It is ESSENTIAL:
- A doctoral degree in animal biology, evolutionary biol-
ogy or related disciplines. - Demonstrated experience in
molecular biology, organismal biology and at least bases
of bioinformatics and biostatistics. - Enthusiasm and
genuine commitment to research work. - Demonstrated
ability to undertake independent research, exibility and
problem solving skills. - Excellent communication skills
in English spoken/written. - Ability to collaboratively
work on a team.
Expertise in phylogenomics and transcriptomics is highly
desirable but not mandatory. The LBDV has an inter-
national working environment, speaking French is not
required but it would be a plus.
The applicant should contact directly Dr. Stefano
Tiozzo (tiozzo@obs-vlfr.fr) providing a letter of interest,

Post-doc, for up to three years: We seek a post-doc to
participate in a US National Science Foundation sup-
ported project entitled \The Paradox of Coexistence:
The Evolution of Ontogenetic Interactions". This re-
search is a continuation of an ongoing experimental
study of the interactions between ecology and evolution
in natural streams in the Northern Range Mountains on
the island of Trinidad. Our project is built around four
experimental introductions of guppies into previously
guppy-free tributaries that contain only one other sh
species - the killish Rivulus hartii. Our prior research
has characterized how each of these species evolves in
response to the other and to the way the ecosystem
changes after the guppy introduction. One discovery is
that their interactions include bi-directional intra-guild
predation. Theory predicts that such an interaction
is very unlikely to be stable, yet it proves to be reli-
ably stable in all four introductions and in all natural
streams where these sh coexist. This apparent anomaly
is the basis for an exploration of factors not included
in theory that could lend to this stability, including the
contemporary evolution of both participating species
and how these interactions change with the age and
size of individuals in both species. Our project is an
integration of the development of new theory, new exper-
iments to be performed in natural and articial streams
in Trinidad and the continued study of the four in-
troductions in natural streams. The post-doc's home
base will be with Joseph Travis (PI) at Florida State
University but will include extensive periods of time
in Trinidad, where he/she will execute experiments in
natural and articial streams. The successful applicant
must have a completed PhD, publication record and
extensive eld experience. You can learn more about
our project at our website <CNAS.UCR.EDU/guppy >.

1) contribute to uncover evolutionary and developmen-

and patterning during ontogeny of a wide range of verte-

similarity between the hard and particularly the soft
tissues of the upper and lower limbs of tetrapods, the
importance of evolutionary reversions/neotenic events,
the study of birth defects in human and non-human

skills, and a profound interest in reading, as you will
be expected to lead, and help write, review papers and
probably books/book chapters on the broader macroevo-
lutionary topics covered above. In turn, by doing this60 EvolDir June 1, 2016
you can relatively rapidly get a substantial experience
in publishing in top journals and monographs.
3) you will also help build and maintain a website, so
you need to have and be able to show previous skills on

Postdoc Position in Computational Biology and Evolu-
tionary Genomics
The Research Group \Computational Biology and Evolu-
tionary Genomics" in Dresden, Germany has an opening
for a Computational Biology Postdoc. The computa-
tional postdoc will leverage methods developed in the lab
to discover genomic dierences underlying the evolution
of morphological dierences in mammals. Promising
candidates will be tested experimentally. The Postdoc
will work closely with other lab members on all compu-
tational aspects and with a group of collaborators on
phenotypic and experimental aspects. Funding accord-
ing to the German TV oD scale is available for at least
3 years.
Our group:
The mission of our group is to discover the dierences
in the genome that underlie phenotypic dierences be-
tween species. Thus, we will contribute to our under-
standing how nature's incredible diversity evolved. To
this end, we are combining computational and exper-
imental approaches. On the computational side, we
build high-quality genome alignments, develop and ap-
ply comparative methods to discover functional genomic
dierences, and use statistical approaches to associate
genomic to phenotypic dierences. On the experimental
side, we sequence and assemble genomes of species with
interesting phenotypes, we use approaches like RNA-seqJune 1, 2016 EvolDir 63
and ATAC-seq to annotate genes and regulatory regions,
and we experimentally test whether editing a discovered
genomic loci in a model organism recapitulates natural
phenotypic dierences.
Our group is located at the Max Planck Institute of
Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) and
we are jointly aliated with the Max Planck Institute
for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPI-PKS), both
in Dresden. Both institutes are highly interactive and
interdisciplinary workplaces, provide an international
atmosphere with English as working language and access
to cutting-edge computational and experimental infras-
tructure and facilities. The MPI-CBG was awarded one
of the \Best Places To Work for Postdocs" in 2011.
Requirements:
Applicants should have a background in bioinformat-
ics or computational biology and a strong publication
record. Excellent programming skills (perl, python, or
C/C++) in a Linux environment as well as experience
with shell scripting and Unix tools are required. Previ-
ous experience in large-scale genomic data analysis is an
advantage. Applicants should also have a strong interest
in the molecular biology underlying species' phenotypes.

ButteryWingVariations
Postdoctoral position on genetic basis of variations in
wing colour pattern development in butteries at the
Natural History Museum in Paris
We are seeking an independent, creative and motivated
post-doc to take part to a project on the evolution of
buttery wing colour patterns in Heliconius and Morpho
clades. The repeated recruitment of the same genes in
contrasted colour patterns from highly divergent Lepi-
doptera species (Nadeau et al. 2016 Nature) stimulates
our research on the development of wing colour pattern
variations in dierent clades. This project is supported
by a 4-years Emergence grant, involving a research teamheaded by Violaine Llaurens, with focus on evolutionary
biology, population genetics and evo-devo. Our lab is
located at the Institute of Systematics, Evolution and
Biodiversity at the National Museum of Natural History
in Paris (France), where both collections and research
facilities cohabit. The emergence grant can cover two
years of postdoc salary and research expenses.
Postdoc projects: The postdoc will be specically in
charge of investigating molecular mechanisms underly-
ing wing colour pattern variations, including dominance
and epistasis.
A rst part, for which samples and preliminary data
are already available, will focus on studying expression
patterns of genes underlying colour pattern variations
in mimetic butteries Heliconius numata and H. hecale.
We are currently characterizing genetic variation under-
lying wing colour patterns in the polymorphic species
Heliconius numata. In this species, variation of colour
pattern is mainly controlled by a supergene, exhibiting
chromosomal inversions (Joron et al. 2011 Nature). We
have identied a few candidate genes controlling dif-
ferent aspects of wing colour patterns. However, this
supergene is highly polymorphic within natural popu-
lations, maintaining high haplotype heterozygosity. By
precisely quantifying wing colour pattern variation, we
showed that dominance between supergene haplotypes
is generally strict, preventing the expression of interme-
diate, non-mimetic patterns (Le Poul et al. 2014 Nature
Communications). However, given the recent evidence
that several genes from the supergene are expressed at
dierent developmental stages, we question how such co-
ordinated dominance has evolved. The postdoc will be
in charge of analyzing transcriptome data from homozy-
gotes and heterozygotes at the supergene, to identify
the mechanisms underlying epistasis and dominance
in this polymorphic species. He/she will also compare
these mechanisms in a closely-related species, namely
Heliconius hecale, to investigate the potential evolution
of dominance mechanisms in the genus.
In parallel to this project on Heliconius for which a lot
of genomic resources are already available, the postdoc
will also investigate the genetic basis of wing colour
pattern variations in three Morpho species (M. helenor,
M. achilles and M. deidamia) from Peru, using both
genomic and transcriptomic data. These three species
exhibit similar wing colour patterns, but also similar
geographical variations, questioning the similarity of the
underlying genetic architecture.
This postdoc will imply mostly lab work and bioinfor-
matics, but will also include eldwork in tropical areas
(Panama and Peru), in order to enlarge the sampling
of colour pattern variations displayed in natural pop-64 EvolDir June 1, 2016
ulations. This two-faceted project will provide ample
opportunity for the postdoc to develop his/her own
original research ideas.
Candidate prole: A Phd in Evo-Devo, with a strong
interest in evolutionary ecology. Experiences with non-
model (insect) organisms, genomics/transcriptomics and
in situ hybridization, as well as eldwork experience in
Tropical countries would be appreciated.
Income and Starting Date: Net salary will be around
2000-2500 euros net per months, depending on experi-
ence. The postdoc will start as soon as possible, but
dates are negotiable.
Application deadline: Applicants should send a CV and
a cover letter, and the names of two references by 31st

Paris6U MicrobialBioinformatics
Hello,
Please nd below the description of a postdoctoral po-
sition to 'Search for common 'genetic goods' in gene
families and microbial communities'.
We are oering a 14 months post-doctoral position,
starting on September the 1rst 2016 (see also http://-June 1, 2016 EvolDir 65
www.evol-net.fr/index.php/fr/postes-a-pourvoir).
The theory of 'genetic public goods' recently postu-
lated that genetic sequences can be exploited in various
combinations, even by distantly related or unrelated
evolving entities, i.e. microbial communities benet-
ing from the sharing of genes between their members,
such as photosynthesis genes between cyanophages and
cyanobacteria, or such as drug resistance genes within
multispecies biolm. Yet, the nature, size and diversity
of microbial communities sharing such 'genetic goods' re-
main poorly known. Moreover, the rules of gene sharing
also remain to be described.
A wealth of molecular data from metagenomic, single
cell metagenomic, and microbial genomes projects is
now available to tackle these fundamental issues. Fur-
thermore, sequence similarity networks oer a promising
complementary niche to phylogenetic methods to ex-
ploit the complexity of these data. These graphs allow
for mathematical analyses of genetic diversity and simi-
larities over dozens of millions of sequences, providing
novel ways to detect 'clubs' of genomes, which have not
necessarily evolved from a single last common ancestor
yet exploit some common genetic material. Likewise,
these networks allows for the detection of some 'sets'
of gene families that exploit common pools of genetic
fragments/domains.
To further develop the detection strategies of genetic
public goods, our lab is now looking for a post-doctoral
fellow in bio-informatics, who will be funded for up to
three years by an ERC grant (for an approximate salary
of 2197 euros/ month after taxes, i.e. 57 350euro before
taxes for the entire post-doc). The candidate will take
advantage of graph properties and algorithms from the
graph theory:
-1) to improve the identication of 'clubs' of genomes
/'sets' of gene and their pool of genetic goods in com-
plex networks with a few millions nodes and dozens of
millions of edges;
- 2) to analyze domains combinations in genes and gene
sharing in communities, using bipartite graphs;
-3) He/she will then analyze the functions of these 'ge-
netic goods' and their distribution across genes and
genomes to test what lifestyles favors their sharing.
The candidate will work within a consortium of friendly
bioinformaticians (Philippe Lopez, Eduardo Corel), evo-
lutionary biologists (Eric Bapteste), and graph theorists
(Michel Habib, Laurent Viennot), and be hosted in the
University Pierre and Marie Curie in the center of Paris,
France. Ideally, the candidate should have a strong
interest for evolutionary biology, microbial evolution
and a good background in bio-informatics, or graphtheory. The position will start by September 2016, but
interested candidates are invited to apply immediately.
He/she should be early in his/her carreer (i.e. holding
a PhD degree for less than 2 years).
Applicants are requested to send a detailed resume,
a motivation letter, a pdf copy of their PhD the-
sis, and the names of two scientic referees to :

entist to join a team of plant phylogenomic and evolu-
tionary experts in Kew's Comparative Plant and Fungal
Biology department. The post will provide excellent
opportunities to engage with the latest advances in
high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to ad-
dress both pure and applied research questions, with
a focus on palm phylogenomics, conservation and seed
science. The research forms part of a broader science
programme \Delivering global tree conservation through
seed science" at Kew funded by the Gareld Weston
Foundation and is linked to Kew's Plant and Fungal
Trees of Life initiative.
The project will focus on a model group of tree species,
the palms. Palms are among the most economically
important of all plants and, as a result, face intensi-ed threats due to selective use by humans. Kew is a
recognised global centre of excellence in palm diversity
research and has a long term interest in the seed biology

conservation of its recalcitrant seeds.
As the research scientist on this project you will 1) gen-
erate and manipulate genomic data for all genera of
palms and for species in the megadiverse Indo-Pacic
tribe Areceae using high throughput sequence capture
techniques, 2) use these data to reconstruct global phy-
logenies for palms and for tribe Areceae, 3) compile
seed trait data to explore their correlations with biogeo-
graphic history, diversication and extinction risk in an
evolutionary context. The project will be highly collab-
orative, involving numerous opportunities to interact
with experts at Kew and beyond.
You will be an outstanding and inspiring scientist with
a PhD and some relevant specialist experience in high-

UAntwerp EvolEcol Rodent
ArenavirusModel
POSTDOC POSITION FOR TWO OR THREE
YEARS - The Evolutionary Ecology Group at Uni-
versity of Antwerp (www.uantwerpen.be/eveco) has an
open position for a postdoc for two or three years, in a
project \Ecology of Lassa virus and related arenaviruses
in the natural host Mastomys natalensis."
Our team in the Evolutionary Ecology Group
(www.uantwerpen.be/eveco) is studying the ecology of
infections in free-living populations of small mammals,
mostly rodents. The pathogens we focus on include
mainly viruses (hantaviruses, arenaviruses, loviruses,
poxviruses,... ) and bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Lep-
tospira, Borrelia,...). Our main research question is
how the ecology and evolution of the hosts aects the
transmission, ecology and evolution of the pathogens,
and vice versa. We are particularly interested in the
temporal and spatial dynamics of these host-pathogen
systems.
We have an open position for a postdoc for 2 or 3
years, in a project \Ecology of Lassa virus and related
arenaviruses in the natural host Mastomys natalensis."
Arenaviruses are RNA viruses with in most cases rodents
as natural host. Lassa virus causes Lassa fever, a dis-
ease that is endemic in West Africa. Control measures
aiming at reducing the virus prevalence in the rodent
population could reduce the risk of rodent-to-human
transmission. However, the course of infection, the dy-
namics of virus-rodent interaction, and modes of virus
transmission among the rodents are poorly understood.
Therefore, a major objective of this research project is to
enhance knowledge on rodent-virus ecology to develop,
in future, rodent-based intervention strategies that are
applicable in the endemic area. In East Africa, other
arenaviruses are found in Mastomys natalensis: those
are not pathogenic to humans but can be studied as a
model system for Lassa virus.
The project involves both eldwork and analyses of
existing long-term data and samples. For the present
position, the focus will be on the modelling work, but
eld activities in Africa and lab experiments in our
biosafety animal facility can be included as well.
Applicants should have a strong cv and proven skills
in statistical and mathematical modelling of dynamic
systems, preferably in ecology or epidemiology. Fieldexperience would be a bonus.
The successful applicant will take the daily lead of the
project, develop the scientic questions and study de-
sign in collaboration with the project leader and take
responsibilities in supervising M.Sc. and Ph.D. students
working on the project. He/she will be expected to
become involved in the general activities of the research
group, which may also involve a limited amount (max.
30h) of teaching.
The position can be taken up from 1 September 2016
or soonest thereafter.

UBern MutationLoad
Postdoc position: Modelling and quantication of mu-
tation load in human populations
A 2 years+ post-doc position is available from July 1st
2016 at the University of Berne to model and quantify
mutation load in human populations. It has been shown
that mutation load should increase in populations having
gone through spatial expansions, and human popula-
tions actually show a gradient of mutation load along
expansion axes out of Africa (http://www.pnas.org/-
content/113/4/E440.abstract).
The successful candidate will develop models of genomic
evolution to nd signals of mutation load in genomic
data and study how load is purged after the end of
an expansion. The post-doc will also study how ex-
pansion load might interfere with adaptations to new
environments.
Finally, available human whole genome sequences will
be used to quantify mutation load in populations hav-
ing a history of range expansions and study how these
signatures are spread and have evolved over the genome.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate to join
our very international lab. The ideal candidate will
have a strong background in statistical or population
genetics and proven abilities to work independently and
in team. Previous experience in C++ and R or another
high-level programming language is a plus.June 1, 2016 EvolDir 71
The successful candidate is expected to be involved in
light teaching and administrative duties. Gross salary is
in the range of 80K CHF per year and follows the Swiss
NSF scale. The CMPG lab oers a very stimulating
research environment with access to high performance
computation facilities and close connections with the
Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Berne is ideally lo-

tionary Biology at UCLA. This position will be sup-
ported by a recently awarded McDonnell Foundation
grant (https://www.jsmf.org/grants/20150014/). Sav-
age combines mathematical models with analysis of large
datasets to uncover insights into biological systems. The
overall goal is to better understand, both empirically and
theoretically, higher-order interactions in biological sys-
tems that range from drug combinations that may slow
antibiotic resistance to consumer-resource interactions
in food webs. In this context, higher-order interactions
means beyond pairwise interactions that involve three or
more objects. The project has the potential to involve
theory development, numerical simulations, and data
analysis. Savage will mentor the postdoc in designing
and conducting research projects, writing papers, givingtalks, and applying for jobs.
UCLA is a major research university with the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences, Medical School, and Engineering
School all on the same campus, allowing access to myr-
iad researchers and resources that could be useful to
this project. UCLA is consistently in the top 5 in terms
of federal research funding awarded to universities. Los
Angeles is a vibrant, diverse city with outdoor activi-
ties available nearby, including beaches and mountains.
L.A. also has a wide array of arts and culture, includ-
ing world-class museums, theater, music, and of course,
movies.
Candidates are expected to be independent, highly moti-
vated problem solvers who communicate well and enjoy
working in a collaborative environment. The ideal can-
didate would have a background in mathematical model-
ing, knowledge of either consumer-resource interactions
or microbial systems, and experience with programming
languages such as Matlab, R, Mathematica, C, and
Python. Applicants with only a subset of these skills
are encouraged to apply. Applications and any questions
should be sent to vsavage@ucla.edu. The application
should include a Curriculum Vitae that details educa-
tion, past research, and publications. Applicants should
also submit a cover letter that describes their interest in
the project and the names of three references. Review of
applications will begin immediately and continue until
the position is lled.
UCLA is an AA/EOE that is strongly committed to

Croft (Exeter, Streatham) and Deborah Charlesworth
(Edinburgh).
The successful applicant will be running breeding exper-iments using sh derived from wild guppy populations,
and subsequently collecting phenotypic and genetic data
for analysis. Phenotypes targeted will include male
colour and pattern traits, but also aspects of life his-
tory and behaviour. The project will also include a
targeted eld component with sampling and live sh
collection from Trinidad during the rst year. Genetic
approaches to be used will include pedigree-based quan-
titative genetic analyses, molecular pedigree analysis,
and mapping of putatively sexually antagonistic loci
using genomic data (e.g. from RAD-Seq). Through
close collaboration with Edinburgh-based researchers
the project will map colour and pattern genes to test
the role of sexually antagonistic selection in driving sex
chromosome evolution. A comparative approach, in
which sh from paired populations diering in selective
regime are used, also provides opportunities to explore
the role of sexual antagonism in shaping patterns of ge-
netic variation and generating intra-locus conict within
and among-populations.
The post will include setting up and maintaining sh
colonies for breeding experiments (with support from
technical sta), phenotypic data collection, sample
preparation (for outsourced sequencing), and bioinfor-
matics/data analysis. The successful applicant will be
able to develop research objectives, projects and pro-
posals; prepare manuscripts for publication in the peer
reviewed literature; and present at conferences and other
events.
Applicants will possess a PhD (or be nearing completion)
in a relevant area of evolutionary biology or genetics.
They should have specialist knowledge and skills in at
least one quantitative aspect of the project (e.g., quanti-
tative genetic modelling, bioinformatics, genomics) and
research experience working with live sh would be ad-
vantageous. The successful applicant will be capable
of working independently when needed but must also
be a good collaborator, with strong interpersonal skills
to liaise with external partners and supervise others
locally in the lab. Applicants will also be able to demon-
strate a strong track record of seeing projects through
to publication.

tematics of pest fruit ies as part of an ongoing eort
to develop an evolutionary framework for the group.
The research project combines traditional taxonomy
with collaborators at UH and USDA using genomic
approaches to improve detection and identication of
tephritid pests. Most of the work for this position in-
volves identication of Tephritid ies and description of
new species using both classical morphology and taxon-
omy in concert with Sanger and genome-wide analysis
techniques. A core goal of this project will be a broad
and deep phylogeny for several genera of Tephritid fruit
ies. Intensive curation of specimens and supervision of
graduate and undergraduate researchers are also part
of the position. There is the opportunity to participate
in the development of the genomics data, though the
morphology is the primary focus of this position.
The applicant will be expected to work independently

research team, including collaborators o campus. Prior
experience in insect morphology and taxonomy, prefer-
ably dipteran, as demonstrated through publications is
required. Specic background in insect taxonomy and
the use of morphological characters for species identi-
cation and description is required. Participation in the
University of Hawaii Insect Museum is an aspect of this
position.
Experience in wet-lab molecular biology, genetics, and
strong interpersonal skills are desirable. The resources
of the University of Hawaii Insect Museum are available,

program.
The University of Hawaii is a major U.S. research in-
stitution based in the Manoa district of Honolulu, up
against the gorgeous Koolau Mountains. The Hawaiian
archipelago is made up of six main high islands and
twice that many smaller ones. The island of Oahu is
home to almost one million people and the state capi-
tal, Honolulu, a cosmopolitan subtropical city with a
diverse and vibrant culture of Polynesian, Asian and,
to a large extent, North American inuences. Oahu
is 596 square miles (1545sq km), and hosts two moun-

SexDeterminationAmphibians
Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral position in
the research group of Nicolas Perrin (Department of
Ecology and Evolution, University of Lausanne).
Sex determination in common frogs (Rana temporaria)
already raised interest in the 1930s with the description
of \sex races" that dier in the patterns of gonadal
development, distributed along climatic gradients. Our
recent studies suggest that sex races also dier both in
the extent of sex chromosome dierentiation and in the
amount of non-genetic contribution to sex determination,
in association with a polymorphism at the candidate
sex-determining gene Dmrt1 (references below).
During this project we will analyze families from dif-
ferent geographic origins and sex races for Y-haplotype
dierentiation, with a focus on Dmrt1. Practical work
will involve the sampling/rearing of frogs and wetlab
analyses (including microsats and RADseq).
The position is available for two years, with starting
date summer 2016 (negotiable). The Department of
Ecology and Evolution is large and thriving, and pro-
vides excellent facilities for research and training (see
http://www.unil.ch/dee/).
Informal enquiries and applications should be sent to
Nicolas.Perrin@unil.ch. Applications should include a
cover letter with a statement of research interests and
qualications for the position, complete CV with publica-
tion list, and contact details of three referees, embedded
in a single pdf le.
We will start reviewing the applications on June 1st 2016,
but will continue to consider incoming applications until
the position is lled.

pers. Lycianthes is its sister genus, with ca. 200 species
distributed in Asia and throughout the Neotropics. The
project will examine the species level taxonomy of these
genera and distribute monographic information on our
Solanaceae Source webpage (solanaceaesource.org). We
will also use next-generation sequencing techniques to
generate phylogenies for the group and its component
clades. This project will provide opportunities for eld
work, student mentoring, public outreach, and collabo-
ration with our partner institution at the University of
California-Davis.
Candidates should have a Ph.D. and experience in plant
systematics; experience with Solanaceae is preferred
but not required. Expertise in molecular phylogenetics
and data analysis is also required and familiarity with
next-gen methods is a plus. The position is available im-
mediately; review of applications will begin on May 15,
2016 and continue until the position is lled. The initial
appointment is for one year, renewable for a second year
upon mutual agreement and satisfactory progress.
Applicants should submit a statement of interest
and description of past experience, a CV, and con-
tact information of three references to Lynn Bohs
(bohs@biology.utah.edu).

Workshop in Conservation and Gene Expression.
September 19-23, 2016, Asilomar, CA
Genomic variation has been a recent focus in conser-
vation of rare and endangered species. However, the
immediate response to environmental challenges will
likely be determined by gene expression, which will
constrain the ecacy of response and the likelihood of
population persistence. Nonetheless, gene expression
has been poorly studied in natural populations facingenvironmental and anthropogenic threats. This 5-day
workshop at Asilomar, a resort on the central California
coast, will focus on providing an overview of the general
approaches to studying gene expression as well as the
molecular and analytical tools needed to initiate and
complete a eld study. We will be oriented toward ques-
tions regarding the conservation of biodiversity, but the
tools and approaches can be applied to a wide variety
of questions. The topics covered will include: 1) RNA
sampling, preservation, extraction and quantication; 2)
library construction and sequencing (RNA-Seq and re-
duced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS)); 3)
ltering, quality control, mapping of reads to transcrip-
tomes and genomes; and 4) statistical analysis, mixed
linear model, WGCNA, GO analysis, TOA and TCA
(for whole blood samples) and other inference techniques;
and 5) interpretation of results and functional analysis.84 EvolDir June 1, 2016

The workshop will not be restricted to taxonomic groups;
it will include examples from plants, invertebrates, and
vertebrates. Applications from University of Califor-
nia graduate and post-graduate community will receive
higher priority as funding is partly due to a UC presi-

Objectives Natural history museums are privileged
spaces for seminal research on dierent subjects of bio-
logical sciences such as biodiversity, evolution, ecology,
biogeography and taxonomy. This crucial role is due to
the fact that they represent biological diversity reposi-
tories becoming huge libraries of information on Earth
living organisms. The long-term sampling through var-
ious decades renders to natural history collections an
historic perspective that allows reconstructing a \mem-
ory", sometimes secular, of natural patterns and pro-
cesses. This aspect gains particular relevance nowadays
because of the increasing rate of species extinctions and
biodiversity decrease. This course aims to: - evidence
the importance of natural history collections for the
study of biodiversity. - show new tools and approaches
to extract and disseminate biodiversity data from nat-
ural history collections - increase awareness of young
researchers for the scientic and culture value of Natural
History Museums.

scholarships are available for US citizens or permanent
residents, including room and board.
https://mdibl.org/course/envgen-2016/ The faculty at
MDIBL is pleased to again oer a training course in Envi-
ronmental Genomics, aiming to better understand tech-
nologies and approaches used to discover how gene func-
tion is inuenced by environmental conditions while ac-
counting for variation that exists within and among nat-
ural populations. This course is built on the paradigm
that the research eld will most eectively grow by
properly designing large-scale experiments enabled by
drastically increased sample-throughput and lower se-
quencing costs. Most importantly, the bioinformatics
challenges of manipulating and analysing population-
level genomics data must be addressed.^ a e^ ae
This course is designed to train the next-generation of
environmental scientists, which have included in past
years: university professors, postdoctoral researchers,
doctoral students and government scientists, represent-
ing institutions from North America and Europe. Most
responded in the departure survey that the course cur-
riculum, choice of technologies, and eectiveness pro-
vided sucient training to either begin or enlarge an
environmental genomics project in their own labora-
tories. All reported that they would recommend this
course to a colleague.
This course trains researchers to design studies, and
to collect and analyse RNA-Seq gene expression data.
Daphnia is used for training because of its growing use
as a model system for environmental genomics and for
improving environmental health protection, yet the skills
learned during the course will be applicable to all studysystems with maturing genomics resources. Much time
is devoted to guiding the current and future projects of
attendees.
Ultimately, participants will be better positioned to
incorporate these technologies into their own research
laboratories, while better understanding how functional
genomics and automation can be applied to ecology,
evolution and environmental toxicology.^ a e

BioinformaticsUsingLINUX
Aug15-19
Course: Introduction to Bioinformatics using LINUX
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones
There are still a few places left on this courses scheduled
for the 15th - 19th August 2016 at SCENE (the Scottish
Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment), Loch
Lomond National Park, Glasgow.
Course overview: Most high-throughput bioinformatics88 EvolDir June 1, 2016
work these days takes place on the Linux command line.
The programs which do the majority of the computa-
tional heavy lifting ^ a egenome assemblers, read mappers,
and annotation tools ^ a eare designed to work best when
used with a command-line interface. Because the com-
mand line can be an intimidating environment, many
biologists learn the bare minimum needed to get their
analysis tools working. This means that they miss out
on the power of Linux to customize their environment
and automate many parts of the bioinformatics work-
ow. This course will introduce the Linux command
line environment from scratch and teach students how
to make the most of its tools to achieve a high level of
productivity when working with biological data.
Availability: 15 places total.
Course programme
Monday 15th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)Session 1 - The design of Linux In the rst
session we briey cover the design of Linux: how is it
dierent from Windows/OSX and how is it best used?
We'll then jump straight onto the command line and
learn about the layout of the Linux lesystem and how
to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's le permission sys-
tem (which often trips up beginners), how paths work,
and how we actually run programs on the command
line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the command line
more eciently, and how to deal with programs that
are misbehaving. We'll nish this session by looking at
the built in help system and how to read and interpret
manual pages.
Session 2 - System management We'll rst look at
a few command line tools for monitoring the status of
the system and keeping track of what's happening to
processor power, memory, and disk space. We'll go over
the process of installing new software from the built in
repositories (which is easy) and from source code down-
loads (which is trickier). We'll also introduce some tools
for benchmarking software (measuring the time/memory
requirements of processing large datasets).
Tuesday 16th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)Session 3 - Manipulating tabular data Many
data types we want to work with in bioinformatics are
stored as tabular plain text les, and here we learn all
about manipulating tabular data on the command line.
We'll start with simple things like extracting columns,
ltering and sorting, searching for text before moving
on to more complex tasks like searching for duplicated
values, summarizing large les, and combining simple
tools into long commands.
Session 4 - Constructing pipelines In this session we
will look at the various tools Linux has for constructingpipelines out of individual commands. Aliases, shell
redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will all be intro-
duced here. We'll also look at a couple of specic tools
to help with running tools on multiple processors, and
for monitoring the progress of long running tasks.
Wednesday 17th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)Session 5 - EMBOSS EMBOSS is a suite of
bioinformatics command-line tools explicitly designed
to work in the Linux paradigm. We'll get an overview
of the dierent sequence data formats that we might
expect to work with, and put what we learned about
shell scripting to biological use by building a pipeline
to compare codon usage across two collections of DNA
sequences.
Session 6 - Using a Linux server Often in bioinfor-
matics we'll be working on a Linux server rather than
our own computer^ a etypically because we need access
to more computing power, or to specialized tools and
datasets. In this session we'll learn how to connect to
a Linux server and how to manage sessions. We'll also
consider the various ways of moving data to and from
a server from your own computer, and nish with a
discussion of the considerations we have to make when
working on a shared computer.
Thursday 18th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)Session 7 - Combining methods In the next
two sessions ^ a ei.e. one full day ^ a ewe'll put everything
we have learned together and implement a workow
for next-gen sequence analysis. In this rst session
we'll carry out quality control on some paired-end Illu-
mina data and map these reads to a reference genome.
We'll then look at various approaches to automating
this pipeline, allowing us to quickly do the same for a
second dataset.Session 8 - Combining methods The
second part of the next-gen workow is to call variants
to identify

DESCRIPTION: The program of the workshop will
consist of a combination of plenary talks by invited
speakers and work performed in small groups, in which
the participants will discuss a particular theme together
with one of the invited speakers. The results of these
small-group sessions willl be presented to the plenum by
student participants, followed by a general discussion.
Social interactions are often assumed to require ad-
vanced cognitive abilities, as social behaviour typically
happens among a large network of individuals, across
dierent contexts, and over extended time periods. This
is at variance with the observation that complex social
behaviour can be observed in a wide range of animals,
both in the laboratory and eld. We think that rather
simple cognitive mechanisms can generate complex so-
cial responses.
The aim of this workshop is to discuss sensory and cog-
nitive abilities and limitations of animals in the context
of the evolution of social behaviour. Topics discussed in
the workshop will include, for instance: -^ a how social
cues and signals are perceived by individuals -^ a how
they are used for decision making - the role of memory
for behavioural responses in repeated social interactions
- the signicance of dierent sensory modalities for com-
munication in the contexts of conict and cooperation.
These topics are of great interest to students and scien-
tists from dierent disciplines, such as evolutionary and
behavioural ecology, neurobiology, cognitive sciences,
and psychology. Interaction between dierent elds
will identify open questions and directions for future
interdisciplinary research

UExeter PoreCamp Aug15-19
PoreCamp is a hands-on training course based around
Oxford Nanopore MinON sequencing technology. This
is the second Porecamp to be run. t is organised and run
by researchers for researchers and is the next installment
in the PoreCamp series of courses. The last installment
was run in December 2015 <http://porecamp.github.io/-
index.html >at the University of Birmingham, UK.
The aim is to provide practical, hands-on experience of
the technology to enable any researcher with basic molec-
ular biology expertise to perform their own sequencing
experiments and learn from some of the leading experts
in the eld.
Date: Monday 15th August - Friday 19th August 2016
Location: Penryn Campus, Cornwall, University of Ex-
eter, U.K.
Learning objectives:
* Preparing high quality MinON sequencing libraries
* MinON operation * Custom scripts to maximise se-
quencer throughput * nitial QC and analysis of MinON
output * Downstream analysis involving de-novo assem-
bly and remapping * Production of a dataset for several
fungal genomes as part of the 1000 fungal genomes
project<http://1000.fungalgenomes.org/home/ >.
DNA will be provided for those who would like work
on the 1000 fungal genomes project. Users will also be
able to bring their own DNA samples but we cannot

Dear all,
Please nd below the preliminary schedule and general
aims of the course, \An introduction to bioinformatic
tools for population genomic and metagenetic data anal-
ysis", oered November 7-11 2016 at the Sven Loven
Centre for Marine Sciences on the island of Tj arn o out-
side of Str omstad on the Swedish West Coast (http://-
loven.gu.se/english/about theloven centre/tjarno).
There is no course fee. Accommodation and meals for
students are provided by the Royal Academy of Sci-
ences of Sweden. Students will need to provide their
own means of transportation to and from the course,
however.
The course will be open to a maximum of 18 students,
as large parts of the course will consist of hands-on exer-
cises. The aim is a broad mix of students both from the
University of Gothenburg and from the outside, mainly
PhD students but postdocs are also welcome to apply.
Knowledge of general molecular biology and genetics is
necessary, as is some previous experience with command-
line interfaces. Previous experience working on a remote
server will also be benecial. No previous bioinformatics
skills are needed, however.

4. Course content
This course aims at detailed understanding and hands-
on experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one\s own biological research questions. An
important aspect of the course is to show how genomic
data can be applied to address and answer research
questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, population
biology, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The
students will be trained in the latest bioinformatic meth-
ods to analyze high throughput sequencing data, which
is present in many research projects. The course will
cover basic computing tools required to run command
line applications, processing high throughput sequencing
data of the CO1 gene from environmental samples to
reveal biodiversity and analysis of sequencing data from
whole genome scans for population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general computing
tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line envi-
ronment, bash commands, data formatting using regular
expressions and basic scripting in the unix shell with a
series of examples and exercises. The course introduces
bioinformatics software for analysis of sequence data
from metagenetics (The high-throughput sequencing of a
molecular marker from an ecosystem or a community of
organisms, used for large-scale analyses of biodiversity),
through a series of live demonstrations (AmpliconNoise,
TaxAssign, QIIME). The course also introduces basic
and advanced concepts of population genomics data
analysis such as genome/transcriptome assembly, anno-
tation (BLAST), alignment/mapping, dierential Gene
expression, functional enrichment tests, SNP genotyp-
ing, PCA, outlier tests. The course corresponds to 1
week of full time studies and and is composed of lectures,
demonstrations and computer labs.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.92 EvolDir June 1, 2016
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
