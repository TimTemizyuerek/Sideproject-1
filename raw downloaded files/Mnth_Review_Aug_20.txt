DiversitySymposium Aug8
Dear EvolDir community, We hope you are well during
these unprecedented times! We are a group of paleontol-
ogy graduate students and early career professionals at
Cornell University in charge of organizing the *14th An-
nual Summer Symposium on Saturday August 8th, 2020
at the Paleontological Research Institution* in Ithaca,
NY. This year, due to the eects of COVID-19 we are
going *virtual*! Given recent events across the world
both outside and within the eld of paleontology, we felt
the need to facilitate a conversation on diversity, equity,
and inclusion with our peers. Consequently, we are
dedicating the PRI Summer Symposium to the topic
of *Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Paleontology*
and are inviting speakers to share their experiences and
discuss a path forward in our eld during several short
sessions.
To pre-register, visit our webpage https://-
www.priweb.org/event/summer-symposium?rq=-
symposium. A list of speakers will be posted soon, so
be sure to check back for updates. We hope to see you
there!\cps257@cornell.edu" <cps257@cornell.edu >
Marseilles 24thEvolutionaryBiology
Sep21-24
Dear all ,
The 24th evolutionary biology meeting at Marseilles will
take place September : 21-24 2021 web : aeeb.fr https:/-
/ebm24.sciencesconf.org/ Here is the philosophy of the
EBM. I was talking to a colleague who is interested
in the evolution of immune systems, particularly the
adaptive immune system in vertebrates. In my opinion,
evolution is a universal process and each case can be
better understood in a more general context. Let us
take the example of the transposome RAG (tranposase
RAG, TIR, system of repair ..) and the process of
cooption of the tranpososme RAG which allowed my
establishment of the system of somatic rearrangement
V(D)J of the immunoglobulins and the T cell receptors
this cooption process is better understood if we under-
stand the biology of transposomes in general, and if we
take into account that this process of co option (DDE
transposon that evolves as specic endonulease involved
in the programmed developmental rearrangement) isAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 3
a process that has occurred several times during the
evolution of the species : for example, yeast mating type
switching and macro / micronucleus transformations
in ciliates. This scientic vision is the essence of the
Evolutionart Biology Meeting \at" Marseilles In fact,
even if the themes presented are dierent , synergies
can occur and the understanding of seemingly dierent
biological systems provides a better understanding of
the biological system being studied.

AGA2020 President's Symposium - Genes as Environ-
ment: Indirect Genetic Eects in Evolution, Agriculture,
and Medicine
Indirect genetic eects (IGE) are genetic eects of an in-
dividual on the trait values of others in the same species.
IGE provides a unifying framework for traditional quan-
titative genetics, maternal and paternal genetic eects,
inclusive tness, and multilevel selection.
The pandemic is still with us, so the AGA is moving
the President's Symposium online. To maximize the
number of people who can participate in real time, the
meeting will take place over 4 consecutive days from
15:00 -19:00 UTC (11:00 - 15:00 EST, 08:00 -12:00 PST,
16:00-20:00 GMT).
There will be breakout rooms for question-and-answer
sessions, and virtual coee/lunch breaks and happy
hours so all participants can interact. Speakers will also
have the option to make videos of presentations available
for a short time period, to accommodate participants
who cannot view talks in real time.
AGA student and postdoc members who submit a
\poster" abstract before September 1st will receive free
registration and the opportunity for a short presentation.The exact format for \posters" has not been nalized,
and we are currently considering several options, includ-
ing 3-minute lightning talks. President Kim Hughes
will select several of the abstracts for 15-minute oral
presentations and $50 Presentation Awards.

Submit abstract by 29 July
Speakers
Programme
Financial Assistance Females and males display striking
patterns of sexual dimorphism in many animals and
other organisms. Dierences are documented in mor-
phology, physiology and behaviour. In recent years,
advances in genomics technologies have facilitated the
discovery of genetic mechanisms underlying sex-specic
phenotypes, showing that sex-biased expression of hun-
dreds to thousands of genes across the genome con-
tributes to male and female phenotypic dierences. The
sex-specic evolutionary forces shaping sexual dimor-
phisms have also begun to be unravelled, including the
interactions between 'master' sex determining genes on
the sex chromosomes, and other genes during develop-
ment to control sex-biases of other genes.
This symposium will focus on the molecular basis and
evolution of sexual dimorphism across animals and other
organisms, including the origins, evolution and biology
of sex chromosomes. It will cover topics ranging from
the evolution of sex determining systems, sex linkage
and sex chromosomes, sex-biased gene expression (on
autosomes and sex chromosomes) and X chromosome
dosage compensation mechanisms, to the evolution of
associated dimorphic phenotypes and the underlying
selective pressures.Session topics:
* The diversity of genetic sex determining regions and sex
chromosomes * Evolutionary challenges for sex-linked
genome regions: Genetic degeneration and dosage com-
pensation * Adaptive evolution I: Sexual antagonism *
Adaptive evolution II: Evolution of sexually dimorphic
phenotypes and gene expression * Sexual dimorphism
in human disease
The virtual symposium will oer:
* Live-streamed presentations and short talks * Live
Q&A sessions * Digital poster presentations * A ded-
icated discussion platform for knowledge-exchange *
Networking sessions built into the programme * Access
to recordings of some of the talks after the symposium

CALL FOR SUBMISSION OF SYMPOSIUM PRO-
POSALS FOR ESEB 2021
A dening feature of ESEB congresses is the \bottom-up"
approach to determining the scientic content of each
meeting. The vast majority of the scientic program is
arranged in symposia topics that are suggested by ESEB
members, and the symposium organisers then also play a
major role in selecting the oral and poster presentations
from the submitted abstracts. Symposia topics can be
on any theme related to evolutionary biology: specic
or broad, emerging or well established. A|symposium
normally consists of around 5-12 oral presentations, 1-2
of which are invited, with remaining abstracts in the
theme being presented together in the poster sessions.
Invited speakers typically have their congress registra-
tion covered (but not travel or accommodation), and
have extended speaking time.
SYMPOSIUM PROPOSAL
You will be asked to provide:
(1) The names and email addresses of the primary organ-
iser (for all communication) and 1-2 co-organiser(s), who
must be committed to attend the whole meeting. (2)
Optional - Links to the professional web pages of organ-
isers and short biographies of organisers (maximum 150
words each biography). (3) The proposed symposium
title. (4) A|maximum 200 word explanation justifying
why you feel your proposed topic warrants a symposiumat the conference. (5) The names of two potential in-
vited speakers (please check beforehand whether they
are indeed available). You can also submit titles of
potential invited talks (optional).
Balance, in terms of gender, nationality and career stage
of invited speakers and symposium organisers will be
included as one criterion used by the scientic commit-
tee when selecting symposia, and successful symposium
organisers are expected to do the same when selecting
oral presentations. ESEB also supports diversity via
conference attendance aid grants.

Antwerpen CichlidGenomics
Fully funded 4-year PhD position in cichlid sh Evo-
lutionary Genomics available in the Svardal lab at the
University of Antwerp
Application deadline: 10 August 2020
The hundreds of closely related but ecologically diverse
species of Lake Malawi cichlid shes provide an excep-
tional model to study the genomic mechanisms involved
in rapid adaptation and diversication.
Cichlid shes are known for their spectacular adaptive
radiations, but some populations are also under recent
heavy shing pressure leading to strong human-induced
selection. In this PhD you are going to dissect genomic
and phenotypic responses to sheries-induced and natu-
ral evolution.
{ You will apply computational genomic approaches to
whole-genome sequencing data of 100s of Malawi cich-
lids to identify genomic adaptations. { Ideally, you will
also have an interest in developing your own computa-
tional methods in python, R, or C/++ etc. { You will
apply ancient DNA methods to sequencing data from
museum specimens to track adaptation through time.
{ Depending on your interest, there will be scope for
experiments and eld work in Malawi: E.g., measuring
growth and maturation traits under controlled condi-
tions in our state-of-the-art sh facilities and (2) using
transcriptomes to understand population dierences.
Prior knowledge in bioinformatics, data analysis, or
statistics is a plus for this position, but also candidates
with a dierent background will be considered, if they
can demonstrate strong motivation to develop in this
direction.
You can apply for this vacancy through the University
of Antwerp's online job application platform until 10
August 2020. Click on the 'Apply' button, complete
the online application form and be sure to include the
following attachments: a motivation letter (max 2 pages,

EvolutionChordateDevelopment
PhD project: Evolution of chordate development
The role:
We are seeking a highly motivated candidate to join
our teams to work on an interdisciplinary project (ex-
perimental and computational) involving single-cell ge-
nomics and chromatin proling in dierent chordate
species. The research program for this position focuses
on elucidating the origin and evolution of the regula-
tory programs controlling vertebrate morphogenesis and
cell dierentiation. To this end, you will apply and
analyse advanced functional genomics to characterize
cell types and regulatory genome features in vertebrate
and non-vertebrate chordate species. Specically, this
involves: (i) scRNAseq to dene cell type-specic gene
expression across multiple developmental stages, and
(ii) bulk ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to map chromatin
states and regulatory element usage. The candidate will
spearhead the analysis, integration, and interpretation
of these comparative omics datasets.
About the teams:12 EvolDir August 1, 2020
Our groups study genome regulation from an evolution-
ary systems perspective. In particular, we are inter-
ested in deciphering the evolution of animal cell type
developmental programs and the regulatory mechanisms
underlying these programs. To this end, we apply ad-
vanced single-cell genomics and chromatin experimental
methods to molecularly dissect cell types and epige-
nomic landscapes in phylogenetically diverse organisms.
We also develop computational tools to integrate these
diverse data sources into models of cell type gene reg-
ulatory networks and we use phylogenetic methods to
comparatively analyze these models. Our recent work
has provided the rst whole-organism cell type atlases
in dierent species and mapped key regulatory features
underlying both development and cell diversity in non-
model invertebrate organisms and the origin of ver-
tebrates. By analysing the development of chordate
species at single-cell resolution, we now aim at dissect-
ing the evolution of vertebrate cellular ontogenies and
their underlying gene regulatory networks

Project summary Understanding the extent of local
adaptation in natural populations and the mechanismsenabling individuals to adapt to their native environ-
ment is a major avenue in evolutionary ecology research.
Host-pathogen coevolution is widely seen as a major
driver of local adaptation and has therefore been a
study model to dissect the evolutionary processes at
work during local adaptation. However, the relative
contributions of species interactions (i.e. biotic factor)
and abiotic factors to local adaptation are still unclear.
Addressing these issues is more than a simple academic
exercise. Understanding of local adaptation processes in
host-parasite interactions will also help tackling pressing
issues, such as the ways in which environmental change
alters the emergence of pathogens leading to host extinc-
tions, how to promote sustainability of agroecosystems
in the face of emerging crop diseases or in guiding for
public health practices as more human pathogens and
their vectors expand their ranges.
In this project, we investigate whether local adaptation
occurred during the recent rapid colonization of culti-
vated apple by Dysaphis plantaginea, the major aphid
pest of cultivated apple orchards, in Europe. We will
carry out in April 2020 experimental tests for D. plan-
taginea tness dierences across environments (i.e. host
and climate) to investigate whether the aphid is locally
adapted to its host and/or climate. This project will
generate original results adding to our understanding
of how species interactions and abiotic conditions can
shape local adaptation.
Master project The project involves the transplant of
Belgian, French and Spanish aphid genotypes on Belgian,
French and Spanish apple varieties in three locations
(Belgian, France and Spain). The candidate will be in-
volved in the assessment of the adaptive capacities at the
ecological level of the rosy apple aphid at the BELGIAN
site located at PCFruit (Sint-Truiden, Belgium). The
project can last four (Bachelor) to six months (Master),
and will consist in participating in aphid infestations
and rearing on the eld, tree measurement, associated
statistical analyses, and nal report writing.
1) The candidate will lead the launching of the experi-
ment there during Spring 2021 by transplanting aphids
on several apple cultivars and will measure several phe-
notypic traits. The growth rate of each colony will be
measured after 12 days of infestation. Various functional
traits which are proxies of the condition of the plant
(i.e. chlorophyll content, carbon/nitrogen balance, and
avonol and anthocyanin content measured with the
Dualex? pincel) will also be measured.
2) He/She will analyze the dataset that will be gener-
ated.
Methodology: Statistical analyses (linear and mixed
models, R), ecophysiology, phenotypic measurement,August 1, 2020 EvolDir 13
rearing, insect biology, eld experiment.
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-
date will have skills in ecology and evolution or at least
will show strong interest in these elds. He/She will
have to be highly motivated about eld experiment, as
this one will be intense the rst two months. He/she will
not necessarily be familiar with apple or aphid model.

EvolutionAquaticSymbiosis
PhD fellowship in 'Developing gregarine apicomplexans
as aquatic symbiosis model system' at the School of Ap-
plied Sciences at Edinburgh Napier University (ENU),
Edinburgh, Scotland.
Application deadline is Wednesday, July 22, 2020 Please
quote the project code SAS0068 in any enquiry and your
application. Envisioned starting date is October 2020,
subject to COVID-19 guidance/recommendations.
About the Project: The Gordon and Betty Moore Foun-
dation's Symbiosis in Aquatic Systems Initiative, seeks
to advance the understanding of aquatic symbioses that
include microbial partners.
Being part of this initiative we are able to provide a
great opportunity for a PhD student to join our in-
ternational project. This PhD project is based within
the School of Applied Sciences at Edinburgh Napier
University and is led by Dr Sonja Rueckert (https://-
www.napier.ac.uk/people/sonja-rueckert) and Dr Anas-tasios Tsaousis (https://www.kent.ac.uk/biosciences/-
people/653/tsaousis-anastasios).
Apicomplexans are widely distributed, single-celled or-
ganisms that are always described as obligate parasitic.
Despite their importance for human health (malaria,
toxoplasmosis) and their virulence in animals, there is
substantial evidence for mutualistic attributes of some
apicomplexans. Gregarine apicomplexans infect almost
all invertebrates and are highly abundant across ecosys-
tems. The early diverging gregarines span the whole
range of symbiosis from mutualism to parasitism and
thus are critical links in the evolution of symbiosis in
the apicomplexans. Despite their importance, informa-
tion on the biology and evolution of these organisms is
lacking with e.g. only a handful of transcriptome and
genome data available.
In-vitro culturing has not been achieved for any gre-
garine, thus this PhD project aims to develop gregarines
as model system. This model system will enable us to
advance the fundamental knowledge on the evolutionary
steps of symbiosis in the Apicomplexa, identifying key
cellular and molecular transitions in the evolution from
free-living relatives to intracellular parasites.
The aim of this project is to develop culturing steps
towards an axenic, tissue free system: 1) Develop inverte-
brate in-vitro culture The student will develop and main-
tain in-vitro culturing systems for gregarines, using their
aquatic invertebrate hosts (e.g. polychaetes, sea squirts,
arthropods). The host's microbiome and metagenome
will be characterized, and associated metabolic proles
obtained. Gregarine transcriptome, genome and cell
biology data for selected systems will be produced to
gain a holistic picture of the gregarine-host-microbiome
interactions.
2) Develop invertebrate in-vitro tissue culture The PhD
student will establish an invertebrate in-vitro 2D tis-
sue culture for gregarine apicomplexans. They will
develop invertebrate cell cultures using tissues from the
gut of invertebrate hosts employed in step-1. This ap-
proach will be assessed by infecting the host cells with
the target species and monitor the success of gregarine
development and propagation using an in-house auto-
mated microscopy system, under controlled atmospheric
conditions.
Academic qualications A rst degree (at least a 2.1)
ideally in a relevant eld such as marine parasitology,
protistology, or microbiology, molecular biology with a
good fundamental knowledge of microbial eukaryotes,
cell biology and laboratory skills.

JagiellonianU EvolutionaryBiology
Graduate position:Krakow JagiellonianU.Evolutionary Biology
PhD position in Evolutonary Biology PhD student po-
sition is oered from October 2020 within the Polish
National Science Centre grant Environment-dependent
balancing selection in a gene involved in sexual con-
ict in Genomics and Experimental Evolution Group
at Jagiellonian University, Institute of Environmental
Sciences.
The project The maintenance of genetic variability, en-
abling populations to adapt to novel environments, is
one of the greatest puzzles in evolutionary biology. ThisAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 15
is because ubiquitous directional selection should lead
to depletion of genetic variation in selected traits. This
is especially the case with sexually selected traits, in
which directional selection is particularly strong. Yet,
substantial genetic variance in these traits is maintained.
A potent force proposed to maintain genetic variation is
balancing selection which can take a form of a crossover
genotype by environment interaction for tness in het-
erogeneous environments. It causes selection to act in
environment-dependent manner so that one allele is fa-
vored in one environment and the other at another one.
We aim to investigate the maintenance of polymorphism
in Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6Pgdh) ?a sexually
selected gene associated with sexual conict in the bulb
mite Rhizoglyphus robini. 6Pgdh polymorphism (with
two alleles, S and F) is associated with dierences in
male reproductive success. The S-bearers have advan-
tage in male-male competition, but decrease fecundity
of their partners. Previous studies suggest that 6Pgdh
polymorphism is maintained by environment-dependent
balancing selection, but the exact mechanisms driving

Initially limited until 30 September 2021, an extension
for further 2-3 years is possible and dependent upon
successful renewal of DFG funding for iDiv (evaluation
in spring 2021)

Salary: Entgeltgruppe 13 TV-L
Leipzig University seeks to ll the following position
at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Re-
search (iDiv), Flexpool, in Leipzig from 1 October 2020
onwards.
Background
The German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Re-
search (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig is a national research
centre funded by the German Research Foundation
(DFG). It is located in the city of Leipzig and
jointly hosted by the Martin Luther University Halle-
Wittenberg (MLU), the Friedrich Schiller University
Jena (FSU), Leipzig University (UL), and the Helmholtz
Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ). For more
information please visit: www.idiv.de . The Evolution &
Adaptation research group (Dr. Renske Onstein) focuses
on the interchange between (macro-) ecology and evo-
lution, to understand the global distribution of genetic,
taxonomic and functional diversity. We investigate mi-
croevolutionary processes to understand how these play
out over macroevolutionary time scales. Understanding
these patterns and the processes underlying them is
important for predicting how adaptable biodiversity is
to current and future global change.
The Project
Madagascar harbours exceptional biodiversity, but thisAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 19
tropical hotspot also faces increasing threat from hu-
man activities and climate change. Plants with large,
'megafaunal' fruits are common across the ora of Mada-
gascar, especially within the palm (Arecaceae) fam-
ily. However, Pleistocene-Holocene extinctions of large-
bodied 'megafaunal' fruit- eating and seed-dispersing
animals (such as giant lemurs) may have hindered
the dispersal of taxa with megafaunal fruits. In this
project we aim to investigate the molecular, micro- to
macroevolutionary consequences of dispersal limitation
in palms, specically focusing on adaptive evolution of
a megafaunal-fruited palm, Hyphaene coriacea, using a
comparative framework of Madagascar (all megafauna
extinct) and mainland Africa (where H. coriacea is still
frequently dispersed by elephants). Specically, we aim
to
(1) identify candidate genes for fruit and seed traits
important for plant- frugivore interactions,
(2) pick up genetic traces of selection or adaptation in
relation to dispersal by smaller-bodied frugivores, and
(3) evaluate the macroevolution of candidate genes or
gene families across the palm family.
This project integrates the elds of plant evolution,
molecular evolution and plant-frugivore interaction ecol-
ogy. It will be in collaboration with researchers from
Hohenheim University (Professor Philipp Schl uter) and
University of Miami (Professor Mauro Galetti), among
others. Besides the salary, there is funding available for
eld and lab work, conference visits and participation
in courses/workshops.
Tasks
- collecting genetic samples from H. coriacea individuals
and populations on Madagascar and mainland Africa,
and measuring their functional traits (part of these sam-
ples has already been collected);
- collecting ecological information about the seed disper-
sal eectiveness (e.g., using camera traps) and demog-
raphy of H. coriacea in the study areas;
- using novel genomic and transcriptomic techniques
(e.g., RAD-seq, RNA- seq) to infer candidate genes for
functional traits and evaluate traces of selection;
- writing and publishing of scientic papers in peer-
reviewed journals;
- presentation of results at international conferences;
- doctoral researchers at iDiv benet from an inter- and
transdisciplinary training and support by the graduate
school yDiv
Requirements- M.Sc. or equivalent degree in a project-related eld (e.g.
molecular biology, genetics, phylogenetics, population
genomics, ecology and evolution)
- prior experience using molecular techniques, preferably
with transcriptomics or bioinformatics, incl. the basics
of scripting/programming for handling and statistically
analyzing large genetic/genomic datasets
- prior experience with tropical natural history, eldwork
and basic living conditions is advantageous
- willingness to spend several months in the eld (Mada-
gascar/mainland Africa)
- excellent English communication skills (speaking and
writing)
- innovative, able to work on his or her own initiative
- team-oriented and strong organizational skills, in order
to manage this collaborative research project within an
international consortium
- independent mind and the ambition to publish in in-
ternationally leading journals

MonashU MarineEvolEcol
A PhD project is available with the research groups
of Keyne Monro and Kay Hodgins in the School of
Biological Sciences at Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia.
Climate change is bringing novel environmental con-
ditions that pose new selective challenges and oppor-
tunities for biodiversity. Understanding the evolution-
ary dynamics and extinction risk of populations facing
rapid environmental change is critical for managing bio-
diversity into the future. This project aims to blend
quantitative genetics, genomics, and theory to explore
the evolution, adaptation and extinction risk of marine
populations facing rapid ocean warming in southeast
Australia.
We are seeking creative and motivated applicants who
wish to pursue research of this kind, with a particular20 EvolDir August 1, 2020

1. Climate change adaptation in an invasive plant In
collaboration with Dr. Mike Martin (NTNU) we have
re-sequenced whole genome samples from hundreds of
herbarium specimens alongside contemporary samples
of the global invader common ragweed. The successful
candidate will track the signals of climate change adap-
tation over historic timescales using these data. 2.The
role of hybridization during biological invasions
In collaboration with the Cousens lab (The University
of Melbourne) and Dr Loren Rieseberg (University of
British Columbia) we have sequenced hundreds of whole
genomes from two independent replicate hybrid zones
formed during invasion by the same two species, Cakile
edentula and Cakile maritima. Hybridisation has been
thought to aid invasion by introducing genetic novelty,
but traditional approaches have been ineective at evalu-
ating alternative explanations. The PhD candidate will
apply new methods on this expansive genomic dataset
and develop novel simulations to resolve how hybridis-
ation and colonisation interact to help and potentially
hinder biological invasion.

Munich InsectEvolution
Doctoral position (f/m/d) - Palaeo-Evo-Devo of Insecta
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student (f/m/d)
to take part in the investigation of the evolutionary
history of insects, including extant and fossil represen-
tatives preserved in amber. The project is funded by
the German Research Foundation (DFG).
The project is based on an interdisciplinary approach, in
which developmental data of extant and fossil species are
incorporated into an evolutionary framework, shortly
referred to as palaeo-evo-devo. The major database is
provided by morphological investigations of extant and
fossil specimens with modern imaging methods. Data
are interpreted in a strict phylogenetic framework.
Focus of research is on immature insects and the recon-
struction of ontogenetic patterns. The fossil record of
immature insects seems quite rich, but is rarely con-
sidered in research. Specimens will be provided via
scientic collections, eldwork is not considered.
The prospective PhD student does not necessarily need
to have experience with the imaging methods or specic
systematic groups, but is expected to gain expertise
early in the course of the project. The project includes
a distinct amount of traveling to collections in Germany
and abroad. The results of the project are expected
to be presented regularly at national and international
conferences by the prospective PhD student as well as
published in peer-reviewed journals.
We are especially seeking for a good team worker being
able to cooperate closely with people in the workgroup
and national and international colleagues of a wide net-work.
The successful candidate will be based in the workgroup
of Zoomorphology at the campus Martinsried (part of
municipality Planegg) south-west of Munich, in close
proximity to Munich. Child care facilities as well as
schools are nearby.
We oer: DFG-funded PhD position (75%) for 36
months; interdisciplinary research project and work-
ing environment; modern imaging equipment (macro-
and microscopic)
We expect: MSc (or equivalent) in Biology or Palaeo-
biology; good English communication skills (oral and
written); ability to work in teams; high motivation; keen
interest in zoological evolutionary questions
The position is limited to 36 months with a presumed
starting date of December 01, 2020.
Applications of women are strongly encouraged.
Severely challenged persons will be given preference
in case of otherwise equal qualications.
Please send your application to jhaug@bio.lmu.de until

EvolComplexAdaptiveSystems
Applications are invited for a fully-funded PhD stu-
dentship exploring the evolution of complex forms of
adaptive plasticity including learning, culture and adap-
tive immunity using a novel computational approach.
The student will work with Prof Kevin Laland (Biology,
St Andrews), Prof Richard Watson (Computer Science,
Southampton) and Prof Thomas Pradeu (Immunology,
CNRS & Bordeaux) to devise theoretical models of evo-
lution in complex systems. The student must be of UK
or French Nationality with a good degree in Computer
Science, Computational Biology or related eld, and
experience of programming. Start date: January 2021,
or soon as possible thereafter.
Background: Living organisms must produce suitable
responses to highly diverse, complex and constantly
changing inputs (e.g. immunological responses to rapidly
evolving bacteria and viruses, or learned adjustments to
quickly changing situations). Often organisms respond
to such challenges through 'exploratory mechanisms',
which are complex developmental systems that operate
by generating variation (i.e. 'exploring' possibilities),
largely at random, testing variants' functionality, and
selecting the best solutions for regeneration, in an itera-
tive developmental process. The process of adaptation
during development arising from exploratory mecha-
nisms resembles adaptation by natural selection (a.k.a.
'somatic selection'), except that it allows for ontogenetic
information gain rather than the acquisition of genetic
information. What the genome encodes is the means to
explore, not the outcome of the exploration.....

DiseaseClimateChange
A four-year funded PhD position ( euro 18,500 per year)
starting either October 2020 or January 2021 (Covid-
19 allowing) is available at the Zoology Department of
Trinity College Dublin, on how climate change aects
disease, under supervision of Pepijn Luijckx. This posi-
tion is only available for citizens of Europe (that is, it
does not cover international fees).
Interested candidates should send: 1) a curriculum vitae
and 2) a cover letter outlining your research interests
and why you would like to do a PhD to: luijckxp@tcd.ie
Project description The health and economic impact of
recent epidemics like Zika and Covid-19 underline the
urgency of understanding how diseases spread and trans-
mit. Moreover, as disease transmission is sensitive to
temperature climate change may alter disease outbreaks.
Indeed, there is an increasing number of examples that
rising mean temperatures may aect diseases dynamics.
However, climate change is not only expected to alter
mean temperatures but also the frequency of extreme
weather events and temperature variation, which may
further aect disease outbreaks. In addition, natural
systems experience both diel and seasonal temperature
uctuations which could change disease dynamics. To
better understand how temperature variation (that is
extreme weather, diurnal uctuations, greater variance
in temperature) aects diseases systems, and develop
new theory, the candidate will conduct experiments us-
ing the Daphnia-Ordospora host-pathogen system under
dierent temperature regimes. This Daphnia model sys-
tem is well established and can be used to study both
the eect of parasitism and temperature in individual
hosts (virulence, tness) and whole populations (growth
rate of the disease Ro, disease dynamics). Experiments
could be supplemented with theoretical approaches in
collaboration with Andrew Jackson (theoretician in theZoology Department), genetic approaches to gain better
insight in the role of host genetics, or eld experiments,
depending on the candidates interests and strengths.
Requirements - Undergraduate or Master's degree in
ecology, evolution or parasitology (or related eld) and
a keen interest in host-disease interactions and climate
change.
Desirable - Creative, motivated and resilient. - Experi-
ence running large laboratory experiments. - Experience
with aquatic insects. - Knowledge of experimental de-
sign and experience using R. - Willingness to contribute
to laboratory maintenance and animal care. - Capable
of working both independently and as part of a team. -
Procient in written and spoken English.
Research group
The candidate will be joining PhD candidates Floriane
O'Keee and Qi Su and Pepijn Luijckx in the sick-
waterea@tcd laboratory at the Zoology Department in
Trinity College Dublin. The lab has a keen interest in
empirically testing evolutionary and ecological theories
pertaining to disease interactions. For example, past
work has tested underlying assumptions of theory on
host-parasite evolution (Luijckx et al. 2013 Current
Biology), the evolutionary maintenance of sexual repro-
duction (Luijckx et al. 2017 PNAS) and how a warming
climate may alter disease outbreaks (Kirk et al 2018).
In addition to the sick-waterea@tcd laboratory the
Zoology Department (https://www.tcd.ie/Zoology/) is
home to research groups with expertise in statistics and
modelling, community ecology, parasitology, and aquatic
biology providing ample opportunities for collaborative
work.

PtarmiganGenomics
Ph.D. studentship in Rock ptarmigan ecological ge-
nomics at the University of Akureyri, Iceland
We're seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. student to work
on a fully funded project on evolutionary genomics and
ecology of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) in Iceland.
The project is funded for 36 months, starting in autumn
2020.
The project Ecological genomics encompasses ecology,
genomics, and evolutionary biology, and utilizes genomicAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 25
approaches to address consequential ecological questions.
In this project we will apply an ecogenomic approach,
by analysis of genome diversity and gene expression, as-
sessing the association of genetic variants to population
cycling or intermediate phenotypes of rock ptarmigan.
Within the frame of the recently completed comprehen-
sive project, \Rock ptarmigan health and population
change" spanning the years 2006-2018, a unique tissue-,
and dataset have been created by the annual collec-
tion of data on this wild bird population. We aim to
explore the impact of trophic interactions such as di-
versity of the gut microbial community, plant-herbivore
interactions and role of toxins. The health parameters
and tissue collection of Icelandic rock ptarmigan are
unique with no such comparable dataset available else-
where. To convey ecogenomic approach we will generate
genomes, transcriptomes, and miRNAomes from the
rock ptarmigan to carry out our comparative genomics
and tissue-specic expression analysis with the goal to
map and characterize genomic regions involved in selec-
tion/adaption and to examine how genes are involved
in various biological processes such abiotic and biotic
stress responses.
The main supervisor of the Ph.D. student will be Pro-
fessor Kristinn P. Magn ~Aosson at the Faculty of Natu-
ral Resource Sciences, University of Akureyri (UNAK,
www.unak.is), and Icelandic Institute of Natural History
(IINH). Other advisors are Professor Jacob H oglund at

Boise, USA. The bulk of the work will be carried out at
the UNAK/IINH laboratories in Akureyri, but the stu-
dent will also attend secondments in Uppsala, Sweden,
and Idaho, USA.
The role of the doctoral student In accordance with
the rules and regulations for doctoral studies at the
University of Akureyri, the student will prepare and
submit their own study plan, and otherwise submit to
the obligations and attain the rights of doctoral stu-
dents at UNAK. The doctoral studies will conclude
with the public defense of a Ph.D. thesis consisting of
peer-reviewed publications in internationally recognized
academic journals.

Application deadline: August 31, or until suitable can-
didates are found
We are searching for quantitatively-oriented, enthusias-
tic, and creative students to tackle problems related to
the spatial ecology of forest insect outbreaks. Selected
students will have the opportunity to work with a diverse
and collaborative research team examining the spatial
and temporal dynamics of spruce budworm outbreaks in
eastern Canada. Team members include Patrick James
(U. Toronto), Dan Kneeshaw (UQAM), Brian Leung
(McGIll), Elise Filotas (TELUQ), Mathieu Bouchard
(MFFPQ), Deepa Pureswaran (NRCAN-CFS), and Rob
Johns (NRCAN-CFS).
The focal subject of this work is the outbreak dynamics
of the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), a
native defoliator that aect millions of hectares of conif-
erous forest during outbreaks. Despite nearly a century
of research, there remain many outstanding mysteries
associated with budworm outbreaks and their eects
on forests. Developing greater understanding of these
underlying population dynamics is essential to improve
forecasting and for developing proactive sustainable for-
est management strategies.
Two projects are available. The general questions associ-
ated with these projects are: 1) what determines where,
when, and the rate at which populations of spruce bud-
worm increase? 2) How will future climate and forest
management regimes aect future outbreak risk and
severity?
Both projects will involve leveraging large spatial-
temporal databases on forest insect outbreaks to develop
predictive statistical, machine learning, and spatially
explicit simulation models of outbreak dynamics.
Potential students should have a strong interest in devel-
oping skills and expertise in forestry, ecology, scientic
computing (e.g., R), GIS, statistics, and modelling. Pre-
existing expertise in these areas would be an asset.

operating at the single-cell level have evolved indepen-
dently in some eukaryotic algae and a single lineage of
land plants, the hornworts. An essential component
for an ecient biophysical CCM is a pyrenoid, which
represents a specialized compartment inside chloroplasts
that mainly comprise the CO2-xing enzyme RuBisCO.
Hornworts with pyrenoids x signicantly more car-
bon than their relatives without pyrenoids. Given the
repeated gains and losses of pyrenoids in hornworts
during the last 50 million years, we may assume that
their assembly is potentially controlled by a few master
regulators of eco-evolutionary relevance. In a joint ef-
fort, we will combine comparative -omics with reverse
genetics tools to study the genetics, function, and molec-
ular basis of pyrenoid-based CCM in hornwort plastids
under dierent environmental conditions. Guided by
ultrastructure-based monitoring of the pyrenoid assem-
bly in hornworts, we aim to identify the genetic toolkit
of biophysical CCM in hornworts through two interde-
pendent approaches: First, we aim to predict candidate
CCM components in silico though a set of homology
searches that compare the hornwort gene set with algal
CCM component. Second, we employ an exploratory
gene and protein (co)expression proling of isolated plas-
tids collected under low vs. high CO2 concentrations
and under ooding. A strength of our experimental
design is that we contrast up to three pairs of pyrenoid
bearing and pyrenoid lacking hornwort species. Finally,
we will investigate pyrenoid functionality under vari-
ous environmental conditions. Specically, we aim to
conduct localization and functional validation analysesfor a core set of genes discovered in our CCM gene
prediction approaches. These experiments are possible
through our recent advances to establish Anthoceros
agrestis and other hornwort species as a tractable model
system. Together, our collaborative project will not
only allow a comparison of the mechanisms of pyrenoid
assembly between algae and hornworts, but also reveal
general principles and species-specic innovations in the
evolution of carbon-concentrating plastids. Above that,
focusing on and understanding the basis of land plant
CCM instead of only the algal form could eventually
contribute to eciently engineer pyrenoid assembly and
boost photosynthetic eciency of crops. Relevant pub-
lications: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-

This project is founded (initially for three years) by the
German National Science Foundation (DFG) MadLand
(https://madland.science/) program to Peter Szovenyi
and Susann Wicke. The project requires collaborative
work including frequent visits to Germany and to the
USA (Fay-Wei Li`s lab at Cornell).
The Dept. of Systematic Botany hosts research groups
working on the evolutionary and ecological drivers of
biodiversity, on the macroevolution of plants, on plant-
insect interactions/pollination, on the evolution of mat-
ing systems, hybridization and speciation. The Dept. of
Plant and Microbial Biology hosts many groups working
on plant molecular and developmental biology, epigenet-
ics, community genomics and plant adaptation. Both
institutes are housed in the beautiful Botanical Gardens
and host a diverse community of researchers in plant
biology.
Ideal candidates will have an MSc in biology with a spe-
cialization in evolution, developmental genetics and/or
bioinformatics. This position primarily involves reverse
genetic, microscopy, gas exchange measurements and
bioinformatic work and requires advanced skills in han-
dling, analyzing and interpreting high-throughput next-
generation sequencing data. Good skills in assembling
vectors, carrying out genetic transformations and mi-
croscopy are also required. Previous experience with
Chlamydomonas pyrenoids is a plus but not necessary.
In case not all these skills are covered, the willingness
to quickly acquire them is absolutely necessary. The
student will closely work together with the second PhD
student/postdoctoral associate in Germany on this grant.
Students should be willing to work both in the wet lab
and in the oce doing computational work. The posi-
tion is initially for three years. Selected candidates will
be enrolled in one of the two aliated PhD schools in
evolution or plant sciences.

extended period (at least threeyears).
Job-Specic Responsibilities
(1) Processing data through a bioinformatic pipeline
and working with its software engineer designers to im-
prove the pipeline:Our laboratory team is constantly
producing new genetic data. Each year, we produce
trillions of new DNA sequences on more than ten thou-
sand ancient individuals. We need aperson who will
take charge of day-to-day computational processing this
stream of data, taking the sequences from their raw
form (as the data are generated by DNA sequencers)to
a processed form that can be used by analysts writing
scientic papers based on the data. We have a full-time
software engineer who has built a software pipeline that
makesthis processing ecient, but the processing needs
to be actively supervised, and frequently repeated with
new parameter settings or redone depending on the
needs of particularanalyses. This is an exciting position
that will put the person who lls the position at the
heart of the work in our laboratory, and will involve
active communication with laboratory-based personnel,

variety of scientic groups onto our computers, and re-
process this externally generated to make it ispossible
to co-analyze with data generated by our group. Dif-
ferent scientic groups upload data to public databases
in a variety of formats, and process their data in a
variety ofways, and a key aspect of this position will
be to grapple with this variety of formats, reprocess
data when necessary, and create a homogeneous com-
bine dataset that can bereliably analyzed. Importantly,
the person who lls this position will not only be down-
loading data but will also need to download meta-data
(for example, information on the locationand age of the
ancient individuals which needs to be extracted from
scientic papers), so that users of the data can have this
information available for their analyses
Basic Qualications - Bachelor's degree in computer
science, data science experience preferred

Revealing Rewiring Routes to Natural Selection: mak-

based on gene co-expression proles
Come and join the Taylor lab at the University of Bath,
UK (https://tianybtaylor.wordpress.com/) as a full-
time research assistant on a 13-month xed-term con-
tract funded by a Royal Society 2020 Enhancement
Award.
Project description: How are opportunities for rewiring
events between gene regulatory networks (GRNs) re-
vealed to selection? Previous work has shown that
GRNs are dynamical such that connections are forged
and lost frequently across an evolutionary timescale. We
predict network activity to be a key factor in revealing
opportunities for rewiring events between previously
disconnected networks, facilitating novel genetic inno-
vations. With a microbial model system, you will use
experimental evolution combined with molecular ma-
nipulations to explore the role of environmentally con-
tingent network activity in predicting rewiring between
GRNs using motility rescue as a model system. This will
inform our understanding of the role the environment
plays in shaping GRN arrangement, with the potential
for dierent environments to rewire GRNs dierently.
Location: This project will be conducted under the
direct supervision of Dr Tiany B. Taylor, and based
within the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at
the University of Bath (UK) in the new Milner Centrefor Evolution (http://www.bath.ac.uk/groups/milner-
centre-for-evolution/).
Requirements: We are looking for a biology graduate
who has a strong interest in genetics, microbiology and
evolution. Some practical experience in microbiology
and molecular techniques is highly desired. The suc-
cessful candidate will be enthusiastic, highly motivated,

Laboratory of Molecular Ecology and Evolution (Biol-
ogy Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences and University
of South Bohemia, Czechia) has funding for a Junior
Researcher (postdoc) in the elds of phylogenomics &
population genomics.
We are reopening a call for a postdoc position (a previ-
ously selected candidate could not join the lab due to
covid situation in their home country).
We are looking for an independent junior researcher
with interest in evolutionary biology and strong back-
ground in bioinformatics and analyses of phylogenetic
and population genetic data. Knowledge of Linux/unix
and experience with scripting & programming languages
(Python, R) and phylogenetic inference using WG data
is necessary. Experience with population genomic and
genome assembly and annotation pipelines is benecial.
A good publication record is important. The applicant
should be able to coordinate a team of 2-3 students andAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 49
have well-developed communication skills.
*Job description:*
This research position will include (mainly drylab) work
on two grant funded projects:
1)Phylogenomics (and species diversity survey) of
Dicyemida, an enigmatic group of parasites from
cephalopods (60% job time allocation).
2)Population genomics of adaptation in parasites. The
project studies interaction between host specicity, ge-
nomic dierentiation, and adaptation in a freshwater
parasite (Ligula intestinalis)(40% job time allocation).
On the 1st project, the postdoc will be responsible for
designing the research strategy (amplicon sequencing
design for species diversity survey, selection of tools
for extracting data from wg datasets) and for analyses
of obtained data (transcriptome assemblies, amplicon
assemblies, mining and ltering genes into matrices,
phylogenetic reconstruction). On the 2nd project, the
postdoc will provide assistance with analyses of popula-
tion level NGS data (whole genome re-sequencing data,
RADseq, SNP calling, demographic inference, analysis
of selection, etc.).
The postdoc will co-supervise one phd student and will
be free to supervise undergrad students if desired (a valu-
able experience). There is an opportunity to take part
in teaching, in eld collecting trips, and in other popgen
projects running in the laboratory (incl. publication
output).
*We oer:*
We are a relatively young but quickly developing labora-
tory with interests in evolutionary and ecological interac-
tions between organisms and their environment. We use
genetic (increasingly more genomic) data to answer the
questions (e.g. https://youtu.be/xvHSjEi0c44?t=7051).
We have advanced computing resources available both
in-house ( >300 nodes) and via a connection to the na-
tional grid ( >20,000 CPUs). The lab collaborates with
institutions/labs abroad (e.g. University of Alabama
[Kocot lab], University of Illinois [Catchen lab], Uni-
versity of Saskatchewan & Cornell [J.A.Andres]) and
we co-organise the biennial Workshop on Population
and Speciation Genomics ( http://evomics.org/2020-
workshop-on-genomics-cesky-krumlov-czech-republic/).
Biology Centre is a dynamic institution with a strong
international community of junior researchers and an
\HR Excellence in Research" awarded institution. It is
located in the centre of a university campus. English
is the working language at the institution. The city of
Ceske Budejovice is a charming historical city, has great
outdoors nearby, and it is located within easy reach ofthe capital, Prague, and several cities abroad (Vienna,
Linz, Passau).
Funding is guaranteed for 1 year, with extension for
another year, based on performance. The salary is
approx. 30% above the Czech average income, it is suf-
cient to cover all necessary living costs with a margin
(Czechia is a developed, yet relatively cheap country to
live in). Biology Centre oers multiple employee bene-

analyses to resolve key phylogenetic problems. The goals
are to develop new more realistic phylogenetic mod-
els including approaches to model heterogeneity in the
process of protein sequence evolution across sites and
branches of phylogenetic trees and accommodate mul-
tiple dierent phylogenetic histories for dierent genes
or sites. New models will be implemented in maximum
likelihood framework and their statistical properties will
be investigated. Other related topics are also open for
investigation.

DukeU EvolutionaryBiomechanics
Postdoctoral Researcher in Evolutionary Biomechanics
The Patek Lab at Duke University seeks the unifying
principles that guide, limit and promote the evolutionary
diversity of biomechanical systems. Our research yields
discoveries of new biological phenomena, original tests
of macroevolutionary hypotheses, and new frameworks
for understanding the mechanical foundations of bio-
logical diversity. We conduct innovative outreach that
enhances equity, access, and transparency for diverse
participants in research.
OVERVIEW
Movement in biology is most often associated with
motor-like mechanisms, such as muscle contractions
in animals or hydraulics in plants. However, organisms
have another option for generating movement: they
can use motor-like mechanisms to load energy into elas-
tic structures, such that pre-loaded elastic structures
generate the movement, rather than motors. Latch-
mediated spring actuation generates movement largely
or exclusively using stored elastic energy and incorpo-
rates latches to mediate energy release. You will join
a research team to examine how organisms navigate
a mass-based transition between movement driven by
stored elastic energy versus by direct motor action. Our
broader goal is to establish the principles by which bio-
logical systems navigate physics-based limits and transi-
tions through developmental and evolutionary processes.
You will engage the broader public through a Research
Experience for Teachers program and the development
and implementation of the open source Muser program
which provides a structured process for equitable and
transparent access to undergraduate research experi-
ence.
BENEFITS
- Join an exciting team of integrative and comparative
biologists with interests and expertise including biome-
chanics, behavior, evolutionary analyses, mathematical
modeling, and materials testing.
- Travel to collaborator labs for eld work experience
and training in physics-based mathematical modeling.
- Build outreach and broader impact skills through work-
ing with high school teachers and implementing struc-
tural changes in academic research to enhance inclusive-ness through Muser.
- Access cutting-edge high-speed imaging cameras
(Photron Fastcam SA-X and SA-Z models), dynamic
materials testing (Electropuls Instron), high resolution
light microscopy, confocal microscopy, SEM, ESEM,
CLSM, and microCT facilities, multi-material maker
facilities, acoustic test chamber, and tropical and tem-
perate saltwater aquarium facilities.
- Become part of a diverse and inclusive lab and univer-
sity, with outstanding job benets in a culturally diverse
and aordable geographic region.
REQUIREMENTS
Education: Ph.D. in Biology, Physics, Materials Science,
or Engineering is required.
Skills: A journal publication record is required to demon-
strate existing skills in completing and publishing re-
search projects. You must be comfortable working with
live organisms. You must have previous experience in
at least one of the following areas: biomechanical anal-
ysis, mathematical modeling, materials testing, digital
image analysis, morphological visualization, develop-
mental/scaling analyses, or evolutionary analysis.
Characteristics: A strong interest in the evolutionary or
physical principles of biological movement is essential.
Patek Lab postdocs establish and lead their projects -
creativity, self-suciency and motivation in your work
are essential. A commitment to building skills for en-
hancing and engaging broader communities in research
is essential.
RESPONSIBILITIES

toral Researcher to join the labs of Scott Sakaluk (bi-
ology.illinoisstate.edu/sksakal/Dr. Scott Sakaluk/) and
Ben Sadd (about.illinoisstate.edu/bmsadd/) in the
School of Biological Sciences, Illinois State University.
The position is part of a project leveraging experimental
evolution lines in the decorated cricket Gryllodes sigilla-
tus (see Sakaluk et al. 2019) to understand the evolution
of sexual conict surrounding the provision of nuptial
food gifts. We are seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher
for a 1-year position to lead the bioinformatic analysis
of existing and future gene expression datasets, starting
as soon as possible. Renewal of the position may be
possible contingent on continued external funding.
Sexual conict, in which the interests of males and
females diverge, is widespread, and males in various
insects provide nuptial food gifts at mating that can
inuence female mating behavior, often against females'
own reproductive interests. Prior studies in decorated
crickets suggest that the food gift is an agent of sexual
conict. The current research project takes an experi-
mental evolution approach, and evaluates the eects of
intensied sexual selection on the chemistry of gifts and
their ecacy in evoking female behavioral and physio-
logical responses. Behavioral studies are ongoing, but
this position will focus on dierential gene expression
in females upon nuptial gift feeding and how gifts from
dierent selection line treatments inuence female tran-
scriptomic responses. The postdoctoral researcher will
set up and analyze the RNAseq data. This includes
the analysis of an existing dataset and involvement in
design and subsequent analyses of future experimentsincorporating the selection lines. Other major responsi-
bilities will be to interact with other project partners
in the Sakaluk and Sadd labs, liaise with an external
collaborator, interpret, present and work together with
the postdoctoral supervisors on publishing project re-
sults. We are open to discussion of remote working
possibilities.
We are seeking candidates with a strong bioinformat-
ics background, with experience in dealing with large
RNAseq datasets from de novo assembly (e.g. Trinity)
through to dierential gene expression and functional
annotation of resulting gene sets. Candidates should
have a PhD degree or be in the process of completing one
in the relevant areas, with a background in evolution,
ecology or animal behavior desired.
In the application process you will need to upload a CV,
a cover letter, a statement of your interest in the position
and how your skills are concordant with the project's
research needs, and a reference list with a minimum of
three referees who are familiar with your work. This
position is full time and we will consider all applications
until a selection of the appropriate candidate is made.

Mathematical models of cooperation in crops
A post-doctoral position is available for 17 months
stating this autumn in Montpellier (France), as fuly
described here :https://bit.ly/2zPFAFH(https://-
emploi.cnrs.fr/Ores/CDD/UMR5554-FRAROU-001/-
Default.aspx?lang=EN for direct access to english
version).
This post-doc is part of the ANR-funded SCOOP project
(https://umr-agap.cirad.fr/en/recherche/projets-de-
recherche/scoop-cooperation-chez-les-plantes-cultivees),
led by H el ene Fr eville (AGAP, INRAE), which will use
a combination of theory and experiments to identify
above- and below-ground traits involved in social inter-
actions and their associated cooperative phenotypes incrops (with durum wheat as an experimental model,
as well as cooperative alleles. One aim of the project
is to provide practical guidelines for breeders and
farmers to design selection schemes that promote plant
cooperation and optimize crop yield in high-density
agrosystems. The post-doc will be supervised by F.
Rousset (CNRS, evolution of social behaviour) at the
Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution (ISEM), and will
benet from the expertise of dierent project members,
including S Gandon (CNRS, development of kin
selection models) and H Fr eville (INRAE, experiments
on kin selection in crops).
The post-doc will develop models to assess the ability
and eciency of dierent selection schemes to select for
cooperative phenotypes. Previous work by our group
(Montazeaud et al 2020) has investigated this question
by considering the evolution of plant height in response
to competition for light. This theoretical framework will
be extended in two directions: (i) we will consider the
coevolution between height and shape. This evolution
will be constrained by trade-os with seed production
(in the absence of competition there is an optimal height
and shape that maximizes yield) but also by potential
correlations between these two traits constraining plant
architecture. This model will predict the impact of an
increase of crop density on these two traits and on yield.
We will manipulate relatedness and the level of selec-
tion among groups in order to identify practices that
maximize yield; (ii) we will account for the change of
architecture during growth, and the ability of plants to
adjust their development in response to the development
of their neighbors. Yield will thus depend on the plastic
response in height to the social partners, and the plastic
response in shape. Modeling the evolutionary dynam-
ics of the development program of the plant under the
inuence of neighboring plants will call for methods of
optimal control theory.

EvolutionaryGenomics
The Blair lab at NYC College of Technology (City
Tech/CUNY) focuses on using genomics and sophis-
ticated computational methods to understand evolution-
ary patterns and elucidate the processes giving rise to
such patterns. Specic areas of focus include genomics,
molecular phylogenetics, phylogeography, species de-
limitation, and DNA barcoding. The lab is currently
seeking a two year postdoctoral scholar who will work
on an NSF funded project that uses multiple species
of phrynosomatid lizards to understand the inuence
of gene ow during the diversication of arid-adapted
organisms distributed throughout the major deserts of
western North America. A second major goal of the
project is to combine genomic data, mtDNA, morphol-
ogy, and ecology to rene species limits and describe
new taxa. Data will be collected from approximately
10 species/species complexes from multiple phrynoso-
matid genera. This project is a collaborative eort with
researchers from multiple institutions with expertise in
genomics, phylogenetics, and morphological analysis.
In addition to conducting research to fulll the objec-
tives of the grant, the scholar will be expected to teach
one undergraduate course per semester of his/her choos-
ing. Formal teaching experience can often make post-
doctoral scholars more competitive for the job market.
City Tech is considered a Hispanic serving institution,
with many students being the rst in their family to
attend college. This postdoctoral position will be par-
ticularly attractive to candidates with a dual interest in
genomic research and in teaching a large, historically
underrepresented population.
Specic duties
Assist in the collection of tissue and voucher samples
in the eld. Maintain databases pertaining to current
tissue holdings. Collect and analyze meristic and mor-
phometric data to aid in species delimitation. Perform
standard molecular lab work (e.g. DNA extraction,
quantication, PCR, sample prep for next-generation
sequencing).
Analyze newly obtained molecular data using recently
developed software. Write manuscripts in collaboration
with other researchers involved with the project. Assist
in supervising undergraduate researchers. Develop apersonalized teaching program at the undergraduate
level. Present results at national scientic meetings.
Meet with PI at least once per week to discuss progress.
Requirements
A PhD degree in a relevant discipline is required prior
to the ocial start date. Candidates should have pre-
vious experience with genomics, phylogenetic analysis,
population genomics, bioinformatics, and cluster com-
puting. Prior programming experience is not required,
but would be benecial. An interest and background
in the biology of reptiles and amphibians would also be
helpful, but is not required. Strong written and oral
communication skills are required. Candidates should
be available for periodic laboratory work. However,
many other duties can be done remotely.
Application
Interested candidates should submit a single pdf docu-
ment containing a cover letter, CV, research statement,
and teaching statement to cblair@citytech.cuny.edu. In
addition, please include contact information for three
professional references. Applications will continue to be
screened until a suitable candidate is found. The ocial
start date is somewhat exible, but will be prior to
September 1, 2020. Informal inquires can be submitted
prior to a formal application.

Job description A 3-year PostDoc position is available
at the Natural History Museum (NHM), University of
Oslo.
The subject of the PostDoc position will be part of
the recently founded RCN-project \InvertOmics - Phy-
logeny and evolution of lophotrochozoan invertebrates
based on genomic data". The origin and evolution ofBilateria is controversially discussed in several biological
disciplines such as systematics or evolutionary develop-
mental biology. In one hypothesis, evolution in Bilateria
advances from a simple body organization similar to
atworms towards more complex forms several times in-
dependently. In the other one, the evolution progresses
in the opposite direction from a complex ancestor more
like an annelid to simple organizations by several sepa-
rate reductions. Support for one or the other depends on
the phylogeny and evolution of Lophotrochozoa, one of
the major bilaterian taxa, but a robust phylogeny is still
lacking despite recent phylogenomic studies. This is due
to both low coverage by genomic data and misleading
biases in data of lophotrochozoan taxa. In this project,
high-quality reference genomes shall be generated and
new procedures to both ameliorate negative eects of bi-
ases and establish a new support measurement, which is
entirely dierent from all recent support measurements.
Due to both the large genomic dataset and these thor-
ough analyses, a robust phylogeny of Lophotrochozoa
shall be provided allowing contributions to discussions
about the origin and evolution of Bilateria as well as of
lophotrochozoan taxa and character traits.
The aim of this PostDoc project is to solve the problems
associated with the reconstruction of the phylogeny of
Lophotrochozoa. The PostDoc can contribute to both
the development a new approach to assess the support
for specic phylogenetic hypotheses and the generation
of new genomic data in Lophotrochozoa. The new ap-
proach shall also determine a priori the best procedure
to ameliorate the eect of misleading biases. There-
fore, the eects of misleading biases shall be simulated
in a phylogenomic setting based on parameter spaces
derived from empirical data including confounding ef-
fects of reticulate evolution, adaptive radiations and
incomplete lineage sorting. Based on these simulated
data both a best-practice procedure and new support
measurement on how likely a reconstructed relation-
ship is true shall be derived. For the generation of new
data, new high-quality genomes for 50 lophotrochozoan
species covering all 16 lophotrochozoan phyla shall be
determined. Modern genome sequencing strategies com-
bining long and short reads will be employed. In the
project, the PostDoc will closely work together and
assist in supervision of the already hired PhD student.
The Natural History Museum has a modern DNA lab-
oratory as well as access to the Norwegian Supercom-
puter facilities. The postdoc will be associated with
the research group \Frontiers in Evolutionary Zoology",
specically Torsten Struck (Professor of Evolutionary
Genomics). The starting date for the position shall be
no later than January 1st 2021.

The Andalusian regional government have launched
the EMERGIA program to nance top researchers
with leadership skills (Please, visit http://www.d-
andalucia.csic.es/es/noticia/Emergia). The purpose of
this call is to facilitate the incorporation of top re-
searchers of any nationality into the universities and
research institutions of Andalusia. Candidates must
hold a PhD degree obtained not earlier than 5 nor later
than 12 years before the date of publication of this call in
the Ocial Gazette. Please, check the aforementioned
webpage for information on salary, research costs, pro-
les and research lines. Deadline for the submission of
applications is 04/08/2020. Our lab (www.evoor.org)
at the Estaci on Experimental de Zonas ~Aridas (http://-
www.eeza.csic.es) is oering the following two comple-mentary research lines:
(1) Phenotypic plasticity in oral signalling and rewards
and its eects on pollinator networks.
Phenotypic plasticity (PP) is a pervasive feature of
life. Although it has been profusely studied in plants,
and many traits are already known to be plastic, how
PP in key oral traits inuences ecological networks
remains largely unexplored. Our lab works with Mori-
candia (Brassicaceae), an arid plant that exhibits within-
individual oral plasticity fostering a signicant shift in
pollination niche. During the mild spring, it produces
large, cross-shaped, UV-reecting lilac owers attracting
mostly long-tongued large bees. During the hot and dry
summer it produces small, rounded, UV-absorbing white
owers attracting many generalist pollinators. Here, we
oer a postdoctoral position to explore the occurrence
of PP in some oral signalling and rewards critical to
understand these observed changes in the interaction
with pollinators. Specically, the goal of this position is
to study the within-individual PP in nectar and pollen
production as well as in oral volatile emissions, and to
quantify how these plastic changes modify the visitation
rate, behaviour, and eectiveness of main pollinators.
This information will be fundamental to understand
how PP reshapes pollinator networks and help plants
to cope with changing environments.
(2) Phenotypic plasticity in photosynthetic metabolism
in arid plants: its role to cope with climate change.
Phenotypic plasticity (PP) is a pervasive feature of life,
pivotal to understand the ecology and evolution of most
organisms. Although PP has been profusely studied in
plants, and many traits are already known to be plastic,
one important aspect remaining largely unexplored is
the PP in photosynthetic metabolism. And this happens
despites it could shed light on how plants cope with
global change. Our lab works with Moricandia (Brassi-
caceae), an arid plant group with a peculiar C3-C4 pho-
tosynthetic pathway that faces two contrasting climatic
conditions, mild during spring and dry and hot during
summer. Because of this strong change in environmental
conditions, the plants exhibit within-individual PP for
several oral and vegetative traits. But little is known
about how the photosynthetic metabolism respond to
this change in conditions, although it is probably key
to understand how plants may keep active during the
harsh summer. Here, we oer a postdoctoral position to
explore this phenomenon. Specically, the position will
be focused on disentangling the physiological, anatom-
ical and genetic mechanisms underlying the seasonal
change in photosynthetic metabolism. This research
will be crucial to understand how plants can face harsh
environments and respond to present-day anthropogenicAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 67
perturbations and future climate change scenarios.

fosters pollination niche shift. Nature Communications,

The potential candidates should have a track record in
evolutionary biology, experimental ecology, ecophysiol-
ogy, ecology of interactions, plant physiology, or plant
genetics, and should have interest and knowledge in
the interactions between plant and pollinators and on
plant signalling and rewarding traits (line 1) or in the
comparative study of C4, C3-C4 and C3 photosynthesis
from one of these general approaches: the physiological,
molecular and evolutionary one (line 2).

if-parallel-adaptation-climate-during A justication and
summary of the proposal is as follows:
\The poleward movement of generalist species in the
Anthropocene is a major cause for concern, and indeed
represents one of the outstanding ecological problems
to address in the 21stcentury. This accelerating phe-
nomenon, originally documented in the 20thcentury, has
now been described repeatedly from diverse taxa, across
latitudinal gradients and in nearly every type of ecosys-
tem. Poleward-moving species often replace native biodi-
versity, resulting in large scale biotic homogenisation of
the world's ecoregions, and also result in novel pests and
disease vectors at higher latitudes, posing risk to food se-
curity and human health. Range shifting species are par-
ticularly problematic for freshwater ecosystems, which
are among the most threatened globally, with many
endemic, high latitude species currently facing new pat-
terns of competition from range-expanding generalists
(including our selected model species, the damselyIs-
chnura elegans,with its highly competitive, predatory
aquatic larval stage). Why do poleward-moving species
often possess generalist phenotypes that allow them to
outcompete natives and destabilising ecosystems? The
traditional, although largely empirically unsupported,
assumption is that expanding species have always been
generalists in their native range, and generalists are
simply more likely than specialists to undergo range
shifts. However, a wealth of previous studies have failed
to nd that niche breadth at any particular location
in the native range reliably predicts successful range
shifts. Moreover, it is already well-documented that
niche traits often rapidly evolve during colonisation.
Our previous pioneering work suggests that the rise of
range-expanding generalists observed across ecosystems
today has resulted from changes in niche breadth and
plasticity which evolve during the process of colonisation.
However, the underpinning mechanisms remain to be
elucidated. * The time is now ripe to understand how it-
erative evolutionary processes during colonisation drive
the evolution of generalist syndromes during species
range shifts.* Enabled by our extensive resources and
data, this project will tackle major outstanding ques-
tions about evolution of the climate niche during range
shifts: 1) How repeatable are genomic responses to novel
thermal environments during colonization? 2) What is
the role of standing genetic variation vs. new mutations
in this process? 3) How do gene interactions and devel-opmental plasticity underpin changes in niche breadth
evolve in colonizing populations? 4) Do patterns of
neutral or adaptive genetic variation generated at the
range front enable future adaptive evolution, and which
process dominates? 5) What are the genetic mecha-
nisms underpinning greater evolvability and plasticity
of cold tolerance during range shifts, in contrast to heat
tolerance? 6) What underpins greater evolvability of
heat tolerance, in comparison to cold tolerance? We
are uniquely enabled by our past research and extensive
genomic and phenotypicdatasets to disentangle these
mechanisms across replicate spatial expansion gradients
and replicate temporal sampling times, and thus will be
able to generate rigorously validated answers to these
important questions. Using a robust, parallel design, we
propose to elucidate the genetic processes underlying
adaptive evolution of climate tolerances during species'
range shifts to higher latitudes. This research will lead to
a step change in our understanding of how niche traits

Postdoc ad in evolutionary biology
The Michod lab in the Department of Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology at the University of Arizona invites
applications for an NSF-supported Postdoctoral Fellow
position anticipated to begin this Fall (depending on
COVID-19 and the University of Arizona re-entry plan).
The general topic of the project is the evolutionary
transition from unicellular to multicellular life. Evo-
lution by natural selection requires heritable variation
in tness at the individual level. During evolutionary
transitions in individuality, such as the transition from
unicellular to multicellular organisms, tness must be
remapped from the cell level to the level of the mul-
ticellular group. The general goal of the project is to
determine how a new genotype-phenotype map arises
at the cell-group level, when initially the map is present
only at the cell level. The methods used in our work
involve lab experiments with volvocine green algae, com-
parative phenomics and genomics, molecular biology,70 EvolDir August 1, 2020
mathematical models, computer models and philosoph-
ical analysis. More information about our work can
be found at http://michodlab.arizona.edu/ or https:/-
/www.researchgate.net/prole/Richard Michod . We
are especially interested in candidates with molecular
biology skills, such as gene expression, gene knockout
and CRISPR, to investigate the genetic basis for group
formation and somatic cell development in the volvocine
green algae. We encourage applications from candidates
who have recently completed, or will soon complete,
their PhD.
Yearly renewal of the position is possible. Yearly salary
will likely be in the $45,000 range, depending on experi-
ence and availability of funds.
To apply, email the following to Rick Michod (mi-
chod@arizona.edu) with the subject line \NSF Post-
doc application: [Your full name]:" (i) A letter briey

Ecology at UC Davis.
The postdoctoral researcher will work on an NSF-funded
project investigating the evolutionary and ecological
dynamics of range expansion in owl limpets (Lottia
gigantea). During the recent marine heatwaves along
the Pacic coast of North America, populations at the
northern range limit of L. gigantea in northern Cali-
fornia have expanded, with ongoing reproduction even
after subsidence of the heatwave events. We plan to in-
tegrate individual tracking data we have been collecting
in northern populations with range-wide genomic data
and experimental phenotyping of larvae and juveniles
to understand patterns of selection and gene ow that
facilitate or impede geographic range expansions.
The postdoc would work closely with a team of faculty,
graduate students and undergraduates. The postdoc
would be based on the UC Davis campus, but the posi-
tion could also involve eld and/or laboratory work at
the Bodega Marine Lab and along the coast of California.
The postdoc will be encouraged to develop their own
research project that furthers our understanding of eco-
logical genomics in marine systems. The postdoc will be
part of a broader community of ecologists, evolutionary
biologists, and marine scientists within the Department
of Evolution and Ecology, the Center for Population
Biology, and the Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute.

host-pathogen interactions working with Wellcome
Trust Sir Henry Dale research fellow Dr Ben Longdon,

This full time post is available on a two year xed term
contract, with the possibility of extension.
About the role
Host-parasite interactions oer fascinating opportunities
to study coevolution, local adaptation and rapid evolu-
tionary change. Our work uses a unique experimental
system of up to 50 species of Drosophila and naturally
occurring RNA viruses to ask fundamental questions
about pathogen host shifts 'V where a pathogen jumps
from one host species to another. Host shifts are a major
source of emerging infectious diseases, with HIV, Ebola
virus and SARS coronavirus having all jumped into hu-
mans from other host species. By taking a comparative
approach, with a strong set of hypotheses from ecologi-
cal and evolutionary theory, we can provide insights into
the factors underlying host shifts that will be generally
applicable to any group of hosts or viruses.
Understanding pathogen host shifts is critical, especially
in light of environmental change. Our model system
has provided key insights into host shifts, namely the
importance of genetic similarity between hosts. Based
on work in Drosophila melanogaster, we know the inter-
actions between host antiviral immunity and the ability
of the virus to supress this immune response, can play
a role in explaining dierences in susceptibility. The
initial aim of the postdoc is to examine why virusescan infect some hosts and not others by looking at how
the viral suppressor of immunity functions in dierent
host species, and how this inuences patterns of suscep-
tibility across the host phylogeny, but there are many
opportunities to develop new projects to explore the
ecology and evolution of pathogen host shifts.
Applicants will possess a relevant PhD or equivalent
qualication/experience in a related eld of study.
The successful applicant will be responsible for lead-
ing experimental work, data collection and analysis,
working closely with the PI and collaborators. The
post will be based at the University of Exeter in the
internationally excellent Centre for Conservation and
Ecology https://www.exeter.ac.uk/cornwall/research/-

description
Understanding which factors determine how a species re-
sponds to environmental change allows us to anticipate
future shifts in community composition. Populations
that experience severe stress, such as in the face of cli-
mate change, may avoid extinction through adaptation
by natural selection. This process is known as evolu-
tionary rescue and can provide a means for species con-
servation. Our objectives are to leverage plant genomicdiversity to 1) infer population structure and genetic
diversity, 2) determine adaptive potential to future pre-
dicted climate change, and 3) model the future spread
of allelic variation and adaptive genotypes. Through
a combination of existing common garden experiments
and sampling from natural populations, together with
genomics and ecological niche models, we aim to iden-
tify adaptive potential to climate change across scales
and over time. Linking information about intraspecic
genomic responses to climate will allow us to better pre-
dict population and species persistence under dierent
future climate change scenarios. The project will likely
involve a combination of eld work at one or more Ama-
zonian and/or Arctic locations, development of target
sequence capture data, leverage of existing full genome
data, and data synthesis using public databases.
The researcher will be hosted in the Department of
Biological and Environmental Sciences under the super-
vision of Dr. Christine D. Bacon. There will be ample
opportunity for collaboration with other scientists in the
Biological & Environmental Sciences at the University of
Gothenburg, as well as at Lund University. The project
is linked to the strategic research area BECC (Biodi-
versity and Ecosystem services in a Changing Climate;
http://www.becc.lu.se/). Job assignments
This employment includes the following tasks:
- conducting independent and collaborative research -
responsibility for managing own workload - production
of scientic articles - eective communication across the

The GEM3 program seeks to understand how genetic di-
versity and phenotypic plasticity aect species responses
to environmental change, focusing on two taxa: redband
trout and sagebrush. These taxa are integral to ecosys-
tems in the American West and central to land-use
management decisions that drive the regional economy.
The selected candidate will build quantitative genetics
models of the genetic and plastic basis of phenotypic
traits in these taxa and their role in adaptive capacity
and population responses to changing environmental
conditions.
The position is part of an interdisciplinary cohort ofpostdoctoral researchers and Ph.D. students working
at scales from genomics and physiology to landscape-
scale mapping and monitoring of social-ecological sys-
tems. The quantitative genetics models will be informed

research group at the University of Neuchatel. The
postdoc will join a team working on various aspects
of the evolutionary epidemiology of host-parasite inter-
actions, focusing on the interactions between malaria,
microsporidians and mosquitoes.The postdoc's research
can be tailored to her or his interests, but should be
within the broad framework of an SNF-funded project,
which deals with the eects of resources on the dynamics
of a parasite within its host. Since a central part of
the project is the role of oxidative stress as a media-
tor of trade-os between resource availability, immune
functions and life histories of mosquitoes and their mi-
crosporidian parasites, I am ideally seeking someone
with experience with phase to phase extractions and
analytical methods for physiological markers (e.g. massspectroscopy, spectroscopy, enzymatic essays, etc).
The Institute of Biology has a broad range of interactive
research groups. Although the University of Neuchatel
is francophone, the department is highly international,
and all its research activity and seminars are conducted
in English. The University of Neuchatel has four fac-
ulties and approximately 4'200 students. It is situated
on a beautiful campus on the shores of Lake Neuchatel,
near Zurich, Geneva and Bern, and is close to the Swiss
Alps.
The position is envisaged at 80% for an initial period of
18 months, with a possible renewal of up to 18 months,
depending on funding. Most of the postdoc's time will
be dedicated to research, but some teaching is expected,
including the possibility of supervising master students.
The starting date is exible; funding is available im-
mediately. Informal enquiries and formal applications
should be sent to Jacob Koella ( jacob.koella@unine.ch).
The applications must be a single pdf that includes a

research into ecosystem service changes that have taken
place over time and in dierent places. The postholder
will be mentored by Jasper Kenter (Environment &
Geography), Lindsay Stringer (Environment & Geogra-
phy) and Chris Thomas (Biology) in collaboration with
others.
We are looking for a person with knowledge and skills
that span the social and natural sciences. They will
be critical to the Centre's endeavours to understand
how the benets and harms that people obtain directly
and indirectly from nature have changed during the An-
thropocene, and thus contribute to the development of
research programmes of the Centre. This research will
focus on the capacity of humans to increase ecosystem
services as much as on our capacity to reduce them.
They will also contribute to the development of research
priorities within the Centre. The postholder will be a
member of LCAB and will work with colleagues across
disciplines, as well as being a member of a University
Department most appropriate to their project.
This role will provide an assessment of the extent to
which humanity has increased the carrying capacity of
the Earth for humans. Whilst there has been a great
deal of recent research on how people benet from na-
ture (ecosystem goods and services, also referred to as
nature's contributions to people), research is required to
enumerate those benets which are a consequence of hu-
mans having intentionally and unintentionally changed
the world's biological systems (human niche creation).
1) You will develop projects to assess the extent to
which global and regional (typically national) ecosystem
service values can be regarded as directly co-produced
(e.g., from sown crops), indirectly 'co-produced' (e.g.,
through increased carbon uptake by ecosystems) or 'orig-
inal' (e.g., harvests of wild species). This will encompass
positive and negative eects, and include diverse eco-
nomic, shared, social and cultural values. The work will
also identify benets that are derived from the exploita-
tion of immigrant species and from species that have
evolved alongside humans by both natural and articial
selection (including new genetic technologies). We an-
ticipate that this research will occupy about 60% of theAugust 1, 2020 EvolDir 89
researcher's time. 2) You will collaborate with other
LCAB researchers to enhance your own core projects
and theirs, for example exploring conicts, trade-os
and synergies between dierent services and benecia-
ries in dierent locations over dierent time frames.
3) You will jointly develop, coordinate and engage in
cross-cutting themes within the Centre (e.g., consider-
ing inequalities and cultural attitudes to ecosystem and
biodiversity change), bringing together its researchers in
programmes of work and collaboration designed to build
transdisciplinary understanding of novel biodiversity. 4)
You will play an active role in LCAB's general intel-
lectual life, contributing to and developing the range
of research interactions and discussions, and oering
expert guidance and contributions to the other strands
of the Centre's research.

human-associated and biological drivers of biodiversity
accumulation in novel and perturbed environments.
This role will develop knowledge of biological change in
response to human perturbation of the Earth system. It

1) You will identify the biological, geographic and soci-

Marseilles RADCamp Oct7-10
Dear all,
over the last 10 years, there was a huge development of
studies using restriction site associated DNA sequencing
(RAD-Seq) in molecular ecology, population genetics,
molecular phylogenetics and species delineation. RAD-
Seq datasets provide sub-genomic sampling at the scale
of thousands or tens of thousands of genome wide loci.
These larger datasets provide more robust phylogenetic
estimates, ner scale population delineation, information
about adaptive variation, and can provide additional
sources of information such as evidence of historical
introgression. The process of organizing and making
sense of the vast quantities of reads that come back
o a sequencing instrument is non-trivial, and of great
consequence.
RADCamp workshops are designed to introduce ipyrad
(https://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a unied
and self-contained RAD-Seq assembly and analysis
framework, which emphasizes simplicity, performance,
and reproducibility. In these workshops we proceed
through all the steps necessary to quality control and
assemble a typical RAD-Seq dataset, including pre- and
post-assembly data ltering. Additionally, we introduce
the ipyrad 'analysis' API which provides a powerful, sim-
ple, and reproducible interface to several widely used
methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships, popu-
lation structure, and admixture.
More information available here: https://-
radcamp.github.io/ RADCamp workshops are
normally geared toward practicing eld biologists
with little or no computational experience. Workshopattendees will need to bring a laptop computer, and
their own RAD data if they have some.
The next session of the RADCamp will take place in
Marseilles (Provence, France) from October 7th to Octo-
ber 10th. The rst two days will be dedicated to training
per se. The third day is optional and will be kept for
any additional requested instruction, open discussions,
and guided help with empirical data assembly.
More precisely the training will take place at the Lu-
miny campus, inside the Calanques National Park|:
http://www.calanques-parcnational.fr/fr. This session
is funded by the Eccorev Research Federation, the En-
vironmental Genomics Research Group, the IMBE lab-
oratory and the Aix-Marseille University.
There are no registration fees, and participants should
manage on their own for accomodations. Only lunches
will be provided. The number of participants is lim-
ited to 20. If you are interested please send a mail to
radcamp2020@osupytheas.fr with a short CV, and a
description of your project(s) with RAD sequencing.

on availability and nancial need.
Participants will also receive advice installing programs
through multiple online help session and also through
tutorials and email. Students with PC can receive help
installing a Linux virtual machine on their PC in the
weeks BEFORE the course. Linux line commands will
be used for several analyses during the course. A brief
tutorial on Linux will be given the rst day for those
interested in learning Linux line commands important
for population genomics data analysis.
The course will be Online this year using Zoom along
with a static forum/blog for writing questions to and
getting answers from instructors (during and after each
lecture). Participants outside North American time
zones (e.g., Europe, Australasia) can watch recorded
lectures (if they cannot participate live) after lectures
are given and still participate in Q & A sessions and
blogs within a few days after each lecture. Because all
lectures and hands-on sessions are recorded (in Zoom),
participants can watch (or re-watch) them the next day
and still ask questions and get instructor feedback (via
the blog or live).
This course is sponsored by the American Genetic As-
sociation, the Journal of Heredity, NASA (the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration), NSF (the Di-
mensions in Biodiversity program), along with PacBio,

ANNOUNCEMENTS
New Online Tutorials: Dynamical Systems in Cultural
Evolution http://www.dysoc.org/news#cesmodules
The Center for the Dynamics of Society Complexity
(DySoC) and the Cultural Evolution Society (CES) an-
nounce a new online learning series presenting basic and
applied lessons in the dynamics of cultural evolution.
To truly understand how culture evolves, scientists of-
ten turn to mathematical models to shed light on how
culture and life history have interacted in shaping who
we are and what we might become.
The CES online learning series, which includes seven
modules, has been developed with self-guided study in
mind. Through a variety of online learning methods,
students will be able to independently work through the
material to gain both a theoretical understanding of the
method and practical experience using it.
The concepts and techniques covered in these modules
are intended to facilitate interdisciplinary conversations
and collaborations. The modules could serve as a basis
for intensive short courses, seminars, or as components
of a regular quarter or semester course.
The modules were created by scholars from around the
world through a competitive process as a part of a grant
from the John Templeton Foundation with principal
investigators DySoC Director Sergey Gavrilets and past
CES President Peter J. Richerson. Technical assistance
was provided by the National Institute for Mathematical
and Biological Synthesis.
Four of the seven modules were released June 16th,
available at http://www.dysoc.org/cesmodules . They
are as follows:
Models of Social Dynamics: An Introductory Module
(created by Paul E. Smaldino, Cognitive and Informa-
tion Sciences, University of California, Merced). This
module takes an interdisciplinary approach to model-August 1, 2020 EvolDir 95
ing social behavior, drawing on insights from across
the social sciences and evolutionary ecology. It focuses
on constructing and analyzing simulations using the
NetLogo programming language.
Animal Cultures: Core Discoveries and New Horizons
(created by Andy Whiten, University of St Andrews, UK;
Lucy Aplin, Max Planck Institute for Animal Behaviour,
Germany; Nicolas Claidi ere, CNRS, Aix-Marseille Uni-
versity, France; Rachel Kendal, University of Durham,
UK). This module oers an overview of core discov-
eries and new developments in the study of animal
cultures. The signicance of animal culture for evo-
lutionary biology and ecology, understanding human
cultural evolution, and conservation are highlighted.
The Neverending Story: Cultural Evolution and Nar-
ratives (created by Joseph Stubberseld, Psychology
Department, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK;
Jamie Tehrani, Anthropology Department, Durham Uni-
versity, Durham, UK; Oleg Sobchuk, Max Planck In-
stitute the Science of Human History, Jena, Germany).
This module explores the universal and uniquely human
behavior of narrative and how cultural evolution theory
has provided vital insights into the transmission and
evolution of narratives and why some become culturally
successful.
Foundations of Cultural Evolution: A Question &#43;
Tools Approach (created by Adrian Bell, Department
of Anthropology, University of Utah). An introductory
guide to the body of formal theory in the study of the
cultural evolution in humans and other animals, this
module guides participants through the basic machinery
of dynamic models and key results from a variety of
cultural evolution topics.
The remaining modules will be released this summer.
They include Modeling the Dynamics of Cultural Di-
versication; Dynamic Models of Human Systems; and
Cultural Evolution of Dynamic Learning.

Instructor: Dr. Dan Warren (Senckenberg Biodiversity
and Climate Research Center Germany) Dates: August10th-12th, 2020
COURSE OVERVIEW:
In this workshop students will be introduced to the EN-
MTools R package, which is a package for constructing
niche and distribution models and using them to test hy-
potheses about patterns of niche evolution. ENMTools
contains a streamlined workow for making, visualizing,
and projecting models, as well as new methods for eval-
uating model predictions, statistical signicance, and
biases in the model construction and projection process.
It also implements Monte Carlo tests addressing many
fundamental questions regarding niche evolution, such
as: - Are two species' environmental associations identi-
cal? - Are two species' environmental associations more
or less similar than expected based on the available
habitat in their ranges? - Are biogeographic boundaries
determined by environmental gradients? - What are the
patterns of niche evolution across clades?
This course will comprise 9 hours of live online lessons
plus 6 hours of pre-recorded classes.

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the LIVE ONLINE

Instructor: Dr. Erik Postma (University of Exeter, UK)
Dates: September 14th-18th, 2020. 9:00-12:00 & 14:00-
17:00 (GMT+1, London time)
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP is available for this course.
Deadline for scholarship applications is July 31st.
COURSE OVERVIEW:
The response to both natural and articial selection
critically depends on the additive genetic variances and
covariances underlying the traits subject to selection.96 EvolDir August 1, 2020
As a consequence, understanding the genetic basis of
complex morphological, life-history, physiological, or-
namental and behavioural traits is crucial if we are to
understand their evolutionary potential, and the evolu-
tionary process in general.
Quantitative genetics uses the phenotypic resemblance
among related individuals to infer the role of genes and
the environment in shaping phenotypic variation. De-
pending on the species, we can use data obtained from
breeding experiments under controlled conditions (e.g.
insects, plants), or from individual-based monitoring pro-
grams in the wild (e.g. birds and mammals). Especially
the latter has beneted greatly from the application
of animal model methodology, originally developed in
animal breeding to identify individuals of high genetic
merit. By simultaneously using the resemblance among
all individuals in the pedigree, these methods provide
more precise and accurate estimates of genetic and non-
genetic variance components (heritabilities and genetic
correlations). Furthermore, they allow for the estima-
tion of individual-level genetic eects (breeding values),
and thereby the inference of evolution.
In this course we will cover everything from basic quan-
titative genetic theory and statistics to advanced mixed
model-based approaches. You will learn how to estimate
genetic variances and covariances in wild and captive
populations, and how to test for evolutionary change.
Along the way, you will be exposed to a range of general
statistical methods (including generalised and mixed
models), the R packages MCMCglmm and ASReml-R
in particular. Furthermore, we will discuss a number
of landmark papers that have put the concepts and
methods covered during the lectures and practicals into
practice to address fundamental evolutionary questions.
You are strongly encouraged to bring your own data
(if you have them), which you will be able to work on
during the course and which will allow you to put the
theory into practice.

Online RADseq Nov2-6
Dear all,
registrations are now open for our course \RADseq
data analysis" which will be held ONLINE in November
(2nd-6th).Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course16/ )
In this course, we will introduce the dierent approaches
for obtaining reduced representation genome sequenc-
ing data and will specially focus on the data analysis
using Stacks. We will cover all necessary steps to ob-
tain genome variants from short read data that are
informative for population genetics, phylogenetic and
association studies.
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are or will be generating and/or analyzing re-
duced representation genome sequencing data (RAD-seq,
ddRAD, 2bRAD, GBS, $B!D(B).
Instructors: Dr. Naiara Rodriguez-Ezpeleta, Dr.
Natalia Diaz Arce (Azti Tecnalia, Spain) and Dr.
Tereza Manousaki (Hellenic Centre for Marine Research,
Greece).

Online SpeciationGenomics Dec7-11
Dear all,
registrations are now open for our 4th edition of the
Speciation Genomics course with Dr. Mark Ravinet
(University of Nottingham, UK) and Dr. Joana I. Meier
(University of Cambridge, UK).
The course will be held online in December (
7th-11th): https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course37/ This course will provide a thor-
ough introduction to the growing eld of speciation
genomics. The course aims to take students from the98 EvolDir August 1, 2020
initial steps required for handling raw sequencing data
to demographic modelling and inference of genome-wide
signatures of selection and introgression. Through a
combination of lectures covering key theoretical and
conceptual topics, alongside hands-on exercises, partici-
pants will learn the most important computational ap-
proaches used in speciation genomics. This will include
a heavy emphasis on data visualization and intepreta-
tion. After completing of the course, the participants
should be able to begin using NGS data to shed light on
the genomic aspects of speciation in their study system
of choice.
Learning Outcomes:
1.Handling NGS data from raw reads to genetic variants
2.Applying basic population genetic statistics
3.Visualizing the genetic structure
4.Inferring demographic history
5.Identifying regions under divergent selection or barri-
ers to gene ow
6.Understanding the potential and limitations of dier-
ent methods to detect regions under selection

Dear colleagues,
Transmitting Science is oering a new live ONLINE
course on teaching evolution: LESSONS IN SCI-
ENTIFIC THINKING: UNDERSTANDING EVOLU-
TION.
Dates: August 24th-28th, 2020. 9:00 to 11:00 online
live lessons (GMT+1, London time)
Instructor: Dr. Brian Metscher (University of Vienna,
Austria)
The course is intended to help participants develop
advanced and subtle thinking skills to improve their
understanding and teaching of central evolutionary and
scientic concepts.
This course is intended for 'V University faculty or sec-
ondary teachers who will teach scientic thinking or
evolution 'V Faculty in teacher education 'V Graduate
students in any eld 'V Anyone interested in being able
to understand science better
In addition to online lectures (10 hours), the course will
include reading/viewing assignments, writing assign-
ments, and group discussions (7.5 hours). Each lesson
will include other resources for teaching the information
and concepts (readings, exercises, videos).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
