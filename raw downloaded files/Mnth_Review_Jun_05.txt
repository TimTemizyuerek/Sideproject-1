2. International Tribolium Meeting in
G¨ ottingen/Germany
It is time to talk about a beetle! The Tribolium cas-
taneum genome has been sequenced, RNAi proves to
be a powerful tool and the ﬁrst insertional mutagen-
esis screen is on its way. Because of these and other
advances, Tribolium has evolved from a comparative
to a full model system that provides answers to novel
questions.
Therefore we invite you to join the discussion on re-
cent ﬁndings regarding segmentation, oogenesis, head
and leg development and other issues. We are espe-
cially happy to announce Guillaume Balavoines talk
about segmentation in the annelid Platynereis dumer-
ilii. Some talks will also cover topics in millipeds and
spiders. Furthermore, we will discuss technical ad-
vances and joint eﬀorts to develop new tools. Finally we
will coordinate our annotation eﬀorts and have a work-
shop “How to annotate your favourite gene”. There will
be plenty of time for informal discussion and a poster
session.
We would be especially happy to welcome people that
are not yet working with the beetle but are considering
doing so. This meeting will be a perfect start to make
contacts and initiate cooperations.
Date: august 3-4, 2005
We hope to see you in G¨ ottingen,

great pleasure to announce the full programme for the
Origins Institute conference and workshop on astrobi-
ology and the origins of life, being held this spring at
McMaster University (please see website for all of the
details). The conference will provide both authorita-
tive, interdisciplinary reviews as well as the latest re-
sults in a number of areas of interest to astrobiology.
The workshop that follows will explore a number of
these areas through informal discussion, with time to
work and begin collaborative projects. The venue fea-
tures the latest in lecture theatres and interactive facil-
ities on the pleasant campus of McMaster University.
The programme for the ONE WEEK workshop is also
available. NOTE: in order to concentrate the workshop
into a very eﬀective programme, the organizers have de-
cided to shorten it to 6 days, rather than the original
advertised length of 2 weeks.
This will be an international meeting with more than
120 participants from many countries already regis-
tered. We encourage anyone interested in this pro-
gramme, which ranges over a number of areas in plane-
tary science and evolutionary biology, to please register
as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the
reduced hotel rates.
You may still present a poster in the conference, or
apply for some remaining openings in our workshop.
Please use the registration form available on the web-
site.

The Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research
(MPIDR) and The National Centre for Statistical Ecol-
ogy (NCSE) are seeking to appoint to a PhD position in
the Statistical Analysis of Age-speciﬁc Survival Rates
The National Centre for Statistical Ecology (NCSE) is
a new joint venture between the Universities of Cam-
bridge, Kent and St Andrews, funded under the EPSRC
multidisciplinary critical mass in Mathematics initia-
tive. It links the research groups in statistical ecology
at the three Universities. This particular position will
principally involve collaboration between the University
of Kent and the Biodemography research programme of
the MPIDR. It will involve spending time both in Ger-
many (Rostock) and in the United Kingdom (Canter-
bury). In Rostock, the successful candidate will com-
plement an existing research team of 19 staﬀ, including
a number of recently recruited evolutionary ecologists.
The team aims to gain a fundamental understanding of
how age-speciﬁc demographic processes are shaped by
evolution. In Canterbury, the student will form part
of a thriving group, working on many diﬀerent aspects
of statistical ecology, biometry in general, and other
areas of applied and theoretical statistics. The group
involves PhD students and post-doctoral research work-
ers. As a member of the National Centre for Statistical
Ecology, the student will also come into close contact
with related work in the universities of Cambridge and
St. Andrews, which host similar research groups. The
successful candidate will work towards their doctorate
through structured coursework, focused workshops and
seminar programmes as well as through their main re-
search project on new statistical methods for modeling
how survival rates of organisms change with age. We
anticipate that mark-recapture data, mostly from bird
and mammal populations, will be the main material
used in the development of these methods.12 EvolDir May 31, 2005

PhD Studenship-
Bumble-bee bat population genetics
A funded three year PhD studentship is available in
the Zoology Department, University College Dublin,
Ireland, starting September 2005. This project plans
to extensively describe and characterize the only two
populations of bumble-bee bat, Craseonycteris thon-
glongyai in both Myanmar and Thailand. The two
populations exhibit a large echolocation diﬀerence, but
on initial genetic investigation appear to be the same
species. Usually in bats, a large echolocation divergence
between two populations of the same species in geo-
graphic proximity, indicates a species level divergence.
The populations will be studied at the morphological,
ecological, acoustic, and genomic level (mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA), to examine the role that sensory
ecology plays in bat speciation.
This project will involve both ﬁeld and laboratory re-
search in Ireland, Thailand and Myanmar. The student
will learn modern molecular techniques; population ge-
netic and phylogenetic analyses methods; bat identiﬁ-
cation and ﬁeld methods.
Successful candidates most hold at least a 2:1 honours
biology degree by September 2005. Field and molecular
laboratory skills are desirable.
If interested please e-mail your CV, areas of research in-
terest and contact details of two referees to Emma Teel-

UEastAnglia Phylogeography
PhD Studentship
Phylogeography School of Computing Sciences
New analytical tools for phylogeography and under-
standing biodiversity
In this project, we will develop new analytical tools
within the recent and rapidly developing ﬁeld of phylo-
geography. Phylogeography is concerned with the anal-
ysis of the geographical distribution of genealogical lin-
eages, with application to understanding the structure
of biodiversity. While current tools for quantifying bio-
diversity typically measure the relative distributions of
species within a region, phylogeography seeks to assess
the geographical distribution of genetic variation within
each species. Given the clear link between genetic vari-
ation and the potential for adaptive response, such as-
sessments are critical for the long-term maintenance of
individual species and species assemblages.
A current challenge in phylogeography is that the easeof obtaining genetic data has far outpaced the devel-
opment of the analytical methods necessary to make
full use of the data. It is becoming increasingly eas-
ier to obtain data from diﬀerent DNA sequence regions
from the same organism, and from diﬀerent organisms
with the same geographic distribution. However, to
analyze them in concert it is now time to follow the
lead taken by the ﬁeld of molecular phylogenetics that
has progressed from single marker studies to more rig-
orous studies of multiple independent genetic markers.
In particular, some speciﬁc gaps in our analytical abil-
ity include: (1) How can we critically assess the degree
to which two or more gene genealogies are concordant
with one another? (2) How can we critically assess the
degree to which demographic inferences from a gene
genealogy/genealogies are concordant with non-DNA
sequence genetic data (e.g. microsatellites, AFLPs,
SNPs)? (3) How do we bridge the gap between phy-
logenetic trees and genealogical networks to deal with
data sets spanning both temporal frames?
In this project we will address problems such as these
using contemporary methods for inferring phylogenetic
trees and networks. Such structures are well suited to
the analysis of biodiversity at the species level. For
example, the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Re-
search (CIPRes) project ( www.phylo.org/index.html ),
is a US led project that aims to build the Tree of Life
based on phylogenetic tree reconstructions from DNA
data from hundreds of thousands of species. Projects
such as this have great potential for categorizing and
prioritizing species for conservation. Even so, as cur-
rently conﬁgured, present methods for phylogenetic in-
ference are not well suited to quantify how genetic di-
versity is distributed across a landscape at the level of
an individual species. This project will involve adapt-
ing phylogenetic methodology to address such issues.
Closing date for applications: 3 June 2005
This project will be supervised by Prof. Vincent Moul-
ton ( www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/people/faculty/vlm ), School
of Computing Sciences, and Dr. Brent Emer-
son ( www.uea.ac.uk/bio/people/faculty/Brent.html ),

UGlasgow MatingSystemsPathogens
PhD Studentship, University of Glasgow
A 3-year PhD studentship is available to study po-
tential interactions between plant mating systems and
pathogen response, using natural populations of Ara-
bidopsis lyrata (Brassicaceae) that vary in their degree
of outcrossing.
Many ﬂowering plants have genetic mechanisms to
reduce detrimental eﬀects associated with inbreeding
(i.e. inbreeding depression) that work by preventing
fertilization of ovules by self-related pollen (i.e., self-
incompatibility or SI systems). These systems tend to
be under the control of complex signal transduction
pathways that are activated when proteins expressed
on the surface of pollen are recognized as matching the
speciﬁcity of those on the surface of the stigma. The
reproductive advantages of being diﬀerent (in terms of
number of available mating partners) result in excep-
tionally high levels of diversity at the loci controlling
the recognition part of the reaction. Plants with a long
history of outcrossing as a result of such processes are
expected to accumulate high genetic loads due to the
increased levels of heterozygosity expected for loci that
are subject to this type of balancing selection. Despite
this expectation, we have identiﬁed populations of A.
lyrata that diﬀer in their degree of outcrossing, pre-
sumably due to failure or relaxation of the SI system.
An important issue in conservation biology is whether
inbreeding always has negative consequences for adap-
tation and survivorship of small populations or whether
negative deleterious mutations are purged following an
initial change from outcrossing to inbreeding.
Immune tolerance, or the ability to adapt to pathogens,
is often assumed to vary with overall host ﬁtness but is
itself an important selective force contributing to biodi-
versity and adaptation that is likely mediated by mat-
ing strategies. Although it has been suggested that
inbreeding should decrease the available spectrum of
responses to pathogens and therefore that inbred pop-
ulations should be more susceptible to pathogens, this
hypothesis has rarely been explicitly tested in natural
populations. The variation in strength of SI among
populations within a single species found here allows
testing of ideas about both inbreeding depression and
pathogen response without complications associated
with comparing populations with diﬀerent mating sys-tems across species.
The main focus of the PhD project would be to ex-
amine the interaction between mating system varia-
tion and pathogen response, through controlled pol-
lination experiments within and between populations
that vary in their strength of SI in relation to the de-
gree of colonization by powdery mildew and/or other
biotrophic pathogens. The project is centred on a re-
search question that draws techniques and underlying
theories from molecular ecology, conservation genetics,
evolution of sexual reproductive systems, population
genetics, molecular biology; classical Mendelian genet-
ics and host-pathogen co-evolution.
The project would be based in the Division of Environ-
mental and Evolutionary Biology at the University of
Glasgow. Interested individuals should send their CV
and a brief statement of their research background and
interests to b.mable@bio.gla.ac.uk. Review of applica-

UHelsinki Sticklebacks
PhD position in Evolutionary Ecology The eﬀects of
eutrophication on sexual selection and viability of stick-
leback populations
A 3-year PhD project is available in the research group
of Ulrika Candolin in the Department of Biology and
Environmental Sciences of the University of Helsinki,
Finland.
Environmental heterogeneity can cause the inten-
sity and direction of selection to vary in time and
space. Yet, the eﬀects of human-induced environ-
mental changes on selection and evolution are poorly
known. Currently, the breeding habitats of the three-
spine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus are changing
in the Baltic Sea due to eutrophication and increased
growth of ﬁlamentous algae and phytoplankton. The
aim of the project is to investigate the eﬀects of in-
creased algae growth and water turbidity on sexual
signalling, mate preferences and the intensity and di-16 EvolDir May 31, 2005
rection of selection on diﬀerent traits in sticklebacks.
The work will be realised through ﬁeld and labora-
tory experiments, both at a ﬁeld station by the sea
(Tv¨ arminne Zoological Station) and in the lab in the
city. Molecular genetic techniques will be applied to
determine the paternity of eggs. For further informa-
tion, see http://www.mv.helsinki.ﬁ/home/ucandoli/ or
contact ulrika.candolin@helsinki.ﬁ.
Starting date would be August 1st at the earliest. The
salary is approximately 1900 EUR/month. Experience
of working with ﬁsh as experimental animals and of
molecular techniques is an advantage, but not nec-
essary. Interested candidates should send a curricu-

UNewcastle MolEvolPlantago
A NERC PhD studentship has become available in the
research group of Dr Kirsten Wolﬀ at the University of
Newcastle, UK
Title: Genetical Ecology and Molecular Evolution in
the genus Plantago.
Eligibility: Applicants must be eligible according
to NERC criteria which can be found at http://-
www.nerc.ac.uk/students/eligible/ (UK students only,
sorry)
The genus Plantago has been studied for a wide range
of questions, from ecology, via genetics to physiology.
The species in the genus have mating systems from ob-
ligate outcrossing to highly selﬁng, diploids as well as
polyploids can be found in the genus and many species
are gynodioecious. This makes the genus very interest-
ing from an evolutionary genetics point of view. The
Plantago species that are most common in the UK have
been studied for their variation at the morphological as
well as the molecular level, for example, for allozymes,
RAPDs, minisatellite DNA ﬁngerprinting and cp RFLP
variation. Studies describing variation at microsatellite
loci are underway. Of particular interest is the repro-
ductive isolation of taxa in the P. major group.
Many aspects of the genetics of Plantago have already
been studied, but even more questions have not been
answered. Therefore, there are opportunities for devel-
oping the project in a number of directions depending
on the interests of the student appointed.
You will join an active research group, interested in
a broad range of aspects of population genetics and
evolutionary biology, in both animals and plants. The
group is housed in a well equipped molecular labo-
ratory, including DNA sequencer. For further infor-
mation on the project, requirements and how to ap-

UOxford WoodFungi
Do ancient woods have ancient fungi, and are they nec-
essary for reestablishment of broadleaf woodland in the
UK?
3 year DPhil (=PhD) CASE studentship supervised by
Dr Nick Brown in the Department of Plant Sciences,
University of Oxford, starting October 2005.
DEADLINE 27 MAY 2005
Many soil fungi are symbiotic with trees and other
woodland plants, enhancing the capacity of seedlings
to establish on resource-poor sites or in competition
with other vegetation. However, we do not yet have
adequate descriptions of the patterns and diversity of
ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi in temperate woodland.
A combination of ﬁeldwork and molecular biology can
oﬀer new insights into the ecology of fungal coloniza-
tion. We are interested in practical questions which
arise from some of the patterns of distribution revealed
so far: can ancient woodland fungi be successfully es-
tablished in newly created woodlands in order to add a
key functional component of the woodland ecosystem?
Have ancient woodland fungi survived in plantations
on ancient woodland sites (PAWS)? The answers to
these questions are important in developing protocols
for PAWS restoration and the creation of new native
woodlands.
Aims 1. To inventory, using molecular probes and ge-
netic analysis of ECM samples taken from the ﬁeld,
the fungi of ancient semi natural woodland and sec-
ondary woodland sites, controlling for soil type, tree
species composition and woodland size. We will com-
pare this with ’fungal foray’ (sporophore) data where
available. 2. To identify ECM species speciﬁc to na-
tive tree species that are restricted to ancient wood-
lands. We will determine how long fungal colonies have
been in a site by mapping the size of single clones us-
ing genetic ﬁngerprinting techniques. 3. To identify18 EvolDir May 31, 2005
the mode of root colonization used by widespread early
successional ECM species and species restricted to an-
cient woodlands. 4. To detect if ancient woodland fungi
have survived in the soils of PAWS sites. To develop
a practical protocol for introducing ancient woodland
fungi to newly created woodlands.

URennes IsolatedSystems
PhD fellowship inADAPTATION AND FUNCTIONING OF SPECIES
IN ECOLOGICALLY ISOLATED SYSTEMS
available at University of Rennes 1, France.
Scientiﬁc background: Most of ecology is implicitly
based on the evolutionary assumption that species re-
spond to environmental change by adaptation. Recent
studies, however, indicate that this is not necessarily
true. Under climate change, for instance, species tend
to migrate with their climate and sedentary species tend
to be replaced by immigrating invaders. Adaptation is
thus replaced by migration and invasion. It has there-
fore recently been suggested that adaptation may oc-
cur only under very particular conditions such as eco-
logical isolation of species within niche space (Ackerly
2003). The major goal of this thesis will be to test the
importance of ecological isolation for phenotypic and
genotypic responses of species to environmental change,
and for the way how species interact with their envi-
ronment. Approaches include meta-analyses of recent
databases on the phylogeny, biology, ecology and soci-
ology of plant species and on their genotypic diﬀerenti-
ation. Application to various model systems in the ﬁeld
is possible.
Organizational background: A PhD fellowship by
the Ecole Doctorale Vie, Agro, Sante ( http://-
www.vas.univ-rennes1.fr/scripts/index.php, alloca-
tions 2005 on the left) for three years, approx. 1040
Euros/month (which can luckily be backed by teaching
assistance). Please note that a certain proﬁciency of
French is expected at the end of the thesis. In fact, the
introductory and concluding parts of the thesis have
to be in French. Such proﬁciency is indeed useful to
more easily integrate. At the same time, everybody is
capable and willing to communicate in English with
a foreigner, and French students are obliged to take
courses in English. For formal reasons, the application
has to contain a one-page summary of your MSc thesis,
and a half-page summary of earlier theses or reports;
and this also has to be in French. The rest of the
application (c.v., expertise, list of all kinds of scientiﬁc
communications, research interests and outlook, letters
of reference, transcripts) as well as the presentation
can be in English. Candidates are invited to submit
their English versions to Andreas Prinzing (see below),
who can also suggest low-price translation services that
may help in the preparation of the French versions.

nook salmon mate choice. We arelooking for students
interested in quantitative genetics and performance as
well as immunogenetics and disease resistance to com-
plement doctoral studies in parental and oﬀspring be-
haviour and feeding physiology. A project decsrip-
tion follows:Mate choice in Chinook salmon: perfor-
mance comparisons with hatchery-bred stock (PhD):
Oﬀspring of Chinook salmon will be produced from par-
ents allowed to breed in semi-natural spawning channels
(sexual selection) or from parents artiﬁcially spawned
using current aquaculture practices (no sexual selec-
tion). All oﬀspring will be followed through to adult-
hood in the aquaculture environment. Behavioural,
immunological, physiological and genetic analyses will
be used to partition diﬀerences in growth performance
and productivity into additive genetic, environmen-
tal and genotype-by-environmental interaction compo-
nents, and ultimately to assess the economics of the
breeding strategies for aquaculture production. Workin the Heath lab (Windsor) will focus on using mi-
crosatellite parentage assignment to partition oﬀspring
trait variance into genetic, environmental and inter-
action components. The project will involve con-
siderable ﬁeld work at our salmon farm partner in

genetics of sunﬂower domestication University of
Wyoming, USA
An M.S. research assistantship is available to work in
the area of evolutionary genetics and computational bi-
ology. The position will begin in late August 2005 and
is funded for two years.
The goal of the research is to estimate parameters of
the population bottleneck that sunﬂowers experienced
in the process of domestication and to identify genes
that experienced selection during domestication. This
is a collaborative project that is led by John Burke at
Vanderbilt University; empirical data are being gath-
ered by the Burke group and the statistical and com-
putational analyses are done in the Buerkle lab at the
University of Wyoming.
This M.S. research assistantship is a good opportu-
nity for a student to gain skills in computational bi-
ology and statistical genetics in the context of in-
teresting evolutionary questions. The central tasks
for the assistantship are computational, and appli-
cants with experience in computer programming, mod-
eling and statistical analysis (R/S-Plus, Perl, C/C++,
Maple/Mathematica, etc.), or a demonstrated aptitude
for and an interest in learning skills of this type, will
be preferred.

microbial dispersal
Testing the theory of microbial ubiquitous dispersal:
molecular and ultrastructural studies of the evolution,
biodiversity and ecology of unicellular eukaryotes
3 year DPhil (=PhD) studentship
Application deadline Friday 27 May 2005
Supervisors: Professor T. Cavalier-Smith FRS, Depart-
ment of Zoology University of Oxford and Dr G. No-
varino, Natural History Museum, London
Some argue that microbial populations are so huge
that global dispersal is inevitable, so species should be
globally distributed, and uninﬂuenced by intercontinen-
tal barriers that cause striking historical biogeographic
patterns in animals, e.g. kangaroos only in Australia.
Paraphysomonas, with morphospecies distinguished by
surface scale ultrastructure, was used to argue that vir-
tually all global species regularly disperse into one En-
glish pond. This has two potential ﬂaws. First, most
?species? were deﬁned from studies in Europe. Most of
the world has never been sampled, especially the trop-
ics and southern hemisphere; maybe hundreds of un-described species never get to Europe. Secondly, mor-
phospecies may not be true species; 18S rRNA genes
show huge genetic diversity. This project will:
1. Use 18S rDNA sequencing of hundreds of freshwater
Paraphysomonas strains from all continents to establish
whether genotypes are cosmopolitan or not.
2. Use electron microscopy to test whether global sam-
pling at the morphological level is relatively complete
or grossly biased geographically.
3. Use DNA sequencing of selected protein genes to
detect linkage disequilibrium and show whether popu-
lation structure is clonal or sexual. If the latter, this
will establish boundaries between biological species.
Students? own ideas or enquiries about other protist
biodiversity projects are also invited.

SPECIAL EVENT AWARDS FROM THE AMERI-
CAN GENETICS ASSOCIATION
The Council of the American Genetics Association in-
vites applications from members of the Association for
support of special events that further the purposes of
the Association. The Association expects to make one
award of approximately $10,000-15,000 each year. Eli-
gible events include specialized workshops open to As-
sociation members in areas of great current interest and
short courses in some aspect of organismal genetics, but
any event that would advance the purposes of the Asso-
ciation is eligible for support. We encourage members
to think creatively about the types of events they could
oﬀer with support from the Association. All applica-
tions received will be carefully reviewed.
An application for a Special Event Award should in-
clude the following items of information:
1. The name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) who will
be responsible for organizing the event and overseeing
the expenditure of any funds awarded. 2. The institu-
tion to which an award should be made, including the
complete address of the relevant institutional depart-
ment and the signature of an authorized institutional
representative indicating the institution’s willingnness
to administer the award if granted. 3. The title of the
event for which an award is requested. 4. A rationale
for the event explaining (a) why the event is timely

Arlequin AFLP data
In attempting to use Arlequin for an AMOVA analysis
of AFLP data, I am unable to get my input ﬁle to work.
The following error message appears: 1 #[ERROR # 1]
from function “Population::read gametic data() (Hapl
NFCC1)” : missing haplotype deﬁnition 2 #[ERROR
# 2] from function “Samples::Read()” : unable to read
sample data Unable to read the speciﬁed number of
populations.
I do not currently have a haplotype list subsection be-
cause the manual states that it is optional and I don’t
know of an easy way to create one (I have 200 samples
and 154 loci). Does anyone know 1) if the haplotype
deﬁnition section is truly optional for AFLP (RFLP)
data? 2) Is there a program that will facilitate the cre-
ation of a haplotype list?
Thanks in advance for troubleshooting assistance.

Biodiversity library
Dear Friends,The Trinidad campus of the University of
the West Indies (UWI) is in the process of strengthening
and consolidating its expertise in biodiversity studies as
a major thrust of this department. As part of this, we
areinterested in improving our campus library’s hold-
ings in this area. The campus has about 9000 students,
the majority undergraduate, with about 300 studying
one or another part of the life sciences. Of this depart-
ment’s 21 academic staﬀers, seven include some area of
biodiversity studies as part of their research.Ifyou have
had occasion to come up witha list of books in biodi-May 31, 2005 EvolDir 29
versity studies – by which I mean the assessment, anal-
ysis and conservation of biological diversity at all levels
– that facilitate my task of formulatingaset of recom-
mendations to our acquisitions librarians, I would very
much like to hear from you. This is not at all to suggest
that we are starting from scratch, far from it.I expect
that we have most or all of the obvious titles, among
others, but the time has come to go beyond the obvi-
ous. The most valuable language, for our purposes, is
English, with Spanish in second place.
While I am at it, I should mention that Trinidad &
Tobago are increasingly favoured as a ﬁeld destination
for ecological and biodiversity studies. These are con-
tinental islands close to the South American mainland,
semi-industrialized but with substantial good habitat,
harbouring an estimated 2-4% of the world’s land and
fresh-water biota. Our government’s Wildlife Sec-
tion(with authority overboth animals and plants) reg-
ulates the collection and export of specimens in a sen-
sible, non-bureaucratic fashion that serves the interests
of science well. These remarks are made in the selﬁsh
consciousness that thoseforeign biologists who work in-
Trinidad & Tobago are providing new knowledge that
beneﬁts all of us.

Contig editors
Dear Colleagues,
After years of searching, I am still unable to ﬁnd a good
sequence editor and contig builder for automated DNA
sequence data that fulﬁlls my needs as an evolutionary
geneticist. I’ve used Sequencher, Codoncode Aligner,
and ABI’s Seqscape. These all have great features, but
none of them has all the best features.
Beyond the standard base calling, trimming, contig30 EvolDir May 31, 2005
assembly, and chromatogram display for proofreading
purposes, Seqscape has the neatest feature: it allows
users to align all of their contigs (using Clustal) and
compare them, calling up the chromatograms as needed
with a simple click of the mouse. This is fantastic fea-
ture that can save many hours of time. The downsides
to Seqscape are that the program is cumbersome, slow,
expensive ($7000?) and only works with ABI generated
sequences (I haven’t found software to export sequences
from my Beckman sequencer in a format Seqscape will
read).
The other two programs are faster and easier to use,
and Codoncode Aligner is only about $1000 (com-
pared to Sequencher’s absurdly high price). But neither
will make an overall alignment of many diﬀerent con-
tigs (with chromatograms accessible), and I ﬁnd work-
around solutions waste many hours.
Does anyone know of a program that is inexpensive,
fast, easy to use, and that will allow correction of data
from a screen showing an alignment of contigs with easy
access to the chromatograms?
Are any programmers seeking the fame and glory (if not
wealth) that would come from ﬁnally writing a practi-
cal sequence correction program for the evolutionary
geneticist?
Thanks,
Steve

Coral DNA degradation
Hello evoldir people!
Our lab is now working on coral DNA for evolution
studies. Extractions are being made with zooxanthel-
lae, as corals are hosts for those. We just started, and
we have serious DNA degradation problem. Surpris-
ingly, DNA extraction done 2 weeks ago and stored in
-20C freezer, which looked great at that moment, is
now already degraded. Has anyone of you already ex-
perienced that sort of problem before??

DNAeasy answers
Qiagen dnaeasy kits costs about $1.70 per specimen:
how can costs be reduced?
(1) Has anyone re-used the column with experimental
conﬁrmation that the column has no dna “carryover”
between specimens?
(2) Has anyone used a column several times for the same
specimen (to make more dna than the speciﬁed 25mg
tissue per dnaeasy column)?
(3) What other ways can costs be reduced?

I am grateful to all who responded (below). Some re-
sponses were about RNA but the ideas might be useful
for DNA. One caveat on cheap quick protocols for pu-
rifying DNA: I wasted much time/ $$ / tissue using
“quick and dirty” puriﬁcation methods: later I found
my “clean dna” failed to PCR-amplify, which was the
main reason I switched to dnaeasy. I will try some
other brands including ones listed below; none below
mentioned “genepure” (ca. $1/sample), which some-
one recently said worked ﬁne for horse and dog blood.
I think none tried to reuse the qiagen column with a dif-
ferent individual (PCR may amplify the contaminating
dna leftover from the ﬁrst column use); many reused
the column multiple times for the same individual as a
way to harvest more dna. =====

Dear all,
I am trying to do a nuclear genetic analysis of an Is-

am trying to ﬁnd good, informative nuclear markers for

and ITS so far, but I would really like to try Cpnl-1
(which has been used in a similar study in grasshop-
pers), as it seems most promising, but I am struggling
with ﬁnd the appropriate primers for this gene. I am
also open to any suggestions for other nuclear markers,
though at this point I am not looking for microsatel-
lites.

Evolutionary Bioinformatics Online is an inter-
national peer-reviewed Open Access journal fo-
cusing on evolutionary bioinformatics ( http://
www.libertasacademica.com/ebo-CFP.htm ). There is
growing awareness that to understand organismal form
and function, through the use of molecular, genetic,
genomic, and proteomic data, due consideration must
be given to an organism’s evolutionary context: historyconstrains the path an organism is obliged to take, and
leaves an indelible mark on its component parts.
Being an Open Access journal means that the papers
published are freely available to everyone via the In-
ternet. Authors retain copyright of their work. The
publishers, Libertas Academica, do not charge readers
any form of sub scription, instead asking authors of ac-
cepted papers to make an article-processing payment.
A number of fee waivers are available and are intended
to facilitate publication by individuals irrespective of
their individual or institutional means.
I write to you as the Editor-in Chief to invite you
to submit an article for publication. To meet pub-
lishing commitments we would need to receive a
manuscript from you by the end of August 2005
to be considered for the next issue. To sub-
mit a paper, go to www.libertasacademica.com/-

Flow cytometry technique
Hello,
I’m a grad student majoring in EEB in Iowa State Uni-
versity. I appreciate your advice on my problem with
ﬂow cytometry technique.
I’m trying to measure ploidy level of purple loosestrife,
using ﬂow cytometry facility. Here is our protocol. The
initial step of common sample preperation is to chop34 EvolDir May 31, 2005
and homogenize the leaf tissue with lysis buﬀer. Then
the sample is ﬁltered two times and centrifuged in 200g
to remove other things in supernatants and preserve
nuclei in pellets.
This technique applied very well to other species.
Though, for purple loosestrife sample, chopped tissue
usually become sticky and mucosy, probably because
of lots of polysaccharides in cytoplasm. And it doen’t
work at all in ﬂow cytometry machine.
I searched over all resources that I can use to ﬁnd bet-
ter protocol for this kind of species, But I couldn’t ﬁnd
how to prepare sample removing mucosy contaminants.
I appreciate your advice and better idea. Thank you.

GammaI model
Hi all,
just some questions.
The “I+Gamma” is very popular model of sequence
evolution with rate heterogeneity among sites. It is a
superposition of two simpler models, which are both
able to account for invariable sites in a sequence align-
ment. The ﬁrst distinguishes two classes of sites, of
which one may evolve while the other is invariable.
The other part is Yang’s discrete gamma model, which
is used for the variable sites. The “I+Gamma” has
two parameters, namely the fraction of invariable sites
(theta) and the shape parameter of the discrete gamma
distribution (alpha).
When I simulate sequences under the “I+Gamma”
and try to re-estimate the two heterogeneity param-
eters by maximum likelihood optimization afterwards,
it turns out that the estimated parameters often diﬀer
severely from the original parameters that were previ-
ously used in the simulation. This indicates to me that
the “I+Gamma” is over-parameterized, that alpha andtheta are not genuinely independent parameters in the
sense that an under-estimated theta can be easily com-
pensated by a smaller alpha and vice versa. It is very
diﬃcult to distinguish invariable sites, which are de-
scribed by theta, from the slow-evolving sites in the
discrete gamma distribution, which are described by
alpha. The good news is that the “I+Gamma” gives
higher likelihoods compared with each of the two sim-
pler models and is therefore often preferred. The bad
news is that parameter estimates do not mean much as
there may exist several combinations of theta and alpha
that appear almost equally probable.
What is the best way to deal with the “I+Gamma”?
Should we
(1) not use it at all?
(2) use it, but ignore the parameter estimates?
(3) optimize only the alpha and determine theta empir-
ically, i. e. by counting the invariable sites?
(4) introduce some constraint between alpha and theta,
which turns the “I+Gamma” eﬀectively into an one-
parameter model?
Any suggestions?

GammaI model answers
Hi all,
with your help, I was able to solve my little optimiza-
tion problem and, thereby, to save the I+Gamma (at
least for me): The trick is to bound alpha >1. Smaller
alphas should not be used. This avoids a situation
where both parameters have nearly the same eﬀect on
the distribution shape and, as a consequence, ’ﬁght’ to
explain the data. On the other hand, this constrained
I+Gamma has still the advantages it was made for:
It can produce two-peaked rate distributions as well
as one-peaked ones, ranging from homogeneity to ex-
tremely L-shaped and anything between. However, it
is better not to the interpret the heterogeneity param-
eters.
Thanks to all who contributed valuable information. As

Hi all,
just some questions.
The “I+Gamma” is very popular model of sequence
evolution with rate heterogeneity among sites. It is a
superposition of two simpler models, which are both
able to account for invariable sites in a sequence align-
ment. The ﬁrst distinguishes two classes of sites, of
which one may evolve while the other is invariable.
The other part is Yang’s discrete gamma model, which
is used for the variable sites. The “I+Gamma” has
two parameters, namely the fraction of invariable sites
(theta) and the shape parameter of the discrete gamma
distribution (alpha).
When I simulate sequences under the “I+Gamma”
and try to re-estimate the two heterogeneity param-
eters by maximum likelihood optimization afterwards,
it turns out that the estimated parameters often diﬀer
severely from the original parameters that were previ-
ously used in the simulation. This indicates to me that
the “I+Gamma” is over-parameterized, that alpha and
theta are not genuinely independent parameters in the
sense that an under-estimated theta can be easily com-
pensated by a smaller alpha and vice versa. It is very
diﬃcult to distinguish invariable sites, which are de-
scribed by theta, from the slow-evolving sites in the
discrete gamma distribution, which are described by
alpha. The good news is that the “I+Gamma” gives
higher likelihoods compared with each of the two sim-
pler models and is therefore often preferred. The bad
news is that parameter estimates do not mean much as
there may exist several combinations of theta and alpha
that appear almost equally probable.
What is the best way to deal with the “I+Gamma”?
Should we
(1) not use it at all?
(2) use it, but ignore the parameter estimates?
(3) optimize only the alpha and determine theta empir-
ically, i. e. by counting the invariable sites?
(4) introduce some constraint between alpha and theta,
which turns the “I+Gamma” eﬀectively into an one-
parameter model?
Any suggestions?

Hi Gangolf,
The two parameters are clearly confounded to some ex-tent. It seems that there is little information in the
data, without large number of sequences for determin-
ing whether a constant site is “invariable” or “slowly
evolving”. You might want to look at these two papers
by Jack Sullivan, in case you haven’t already.

we know assumptions about among-site rate variation

I think this is an interesting question. I too have been
concerned about the use of I+Gamma and the interpre-
tation of estimated parameters. I would be interested
to hear what other responses you get, and I encourage
you to post summaries to the EVOLDIR list.

I too have observed this.
I recall Ziheng Yang telling me something similar; he
performed experiments sub-sampling sequences from a
multiple alignment, and estimated the parameter you
are calling theta (he was not using +Gamma then, I
think). He found that as you included more and more of
the sequences, the parameter you are calling theta got
lower and lower. Evidently the +I part of the model has
some trouble distinguishing sites that never vary, and
sites which may vary but happen not to have in the tree
under consideration. But you should check with Ziheng
if you are

Gradients SexualSelection
Dear colleages,
I recently came across this interesting quote:
“In other words, the fact that, for example, many trop-
ical bird species are more colourful and have more intri-
cate song patterns than birds from colder environments,
does not necessarily result from selection, but may sim-
ply be the result of random addition of species (Rohde
2005)”
Rohde, K. 2005. Cellular automata and ecology. Oikos
110: 203-207.
I thought this hypothesis is indeed intriguing, but I was
wondering: are you aware of any hypothesis to explain
consistent diﬀerences in the degree mating signal com-
plexity according to the environment or latitude? (in
addition to the one I just listed.
Any hints will be greatly appreciated. Please respond

ID minister
The Dutch minister of Education and Science, Maria
van der Hoeven (Christian Democrat) has said that she
would like to organize a broad debate about evolution-
ary theory and religion. (Saturday 21 May in an inter-
view in the paper Volkskrant). She said that she would
like to promote a dialogue between scientists and peo-
ple favouring creation (in a wide sense). Minister Maria
van der Hoeven said that she herself is an adherent of
Intelligent Design. She said that “it should be recog-
nized that evolutionary theory is not complete, as we
are still discovering new things”. Parliament is hav-
ing nothing of it. In the Netherlands, less than half of
the population has connections to a church. The minis-
ter seems badly suited for her job. Minister Maria van
der Hoeven did not think it necessary that prospective
primary school teachers have any math in their back-
ground training.

IntelligentDesign ﬁlm at
Smithsonian
To the evolution community:
Many of you may be aware from recent newspaper
articles (for example, the New York Times article
available at http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/-
national/28smithsonian ), that the NationalMuseum of
Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution is about
to show a ﬁlm that was co-written and co-produced
by members of the creationist Discovery Institute.
(The showing is on June 23.) This ﬁlm, called “The
Privileged Planet”, the Search for Purpose in the
Universe“. It is an attempt to use geology, climatology,
and physics to show that the earth was designed by
an intelligent designer, and of course is part of the
latest strategy of ”intelligent design“ creationists to
worm their way into the public consciousness and
school curriculum. You can read about the ﬁlm
at its website http://www.privilegedplanet.com/,
and see the Discovery Institute’s announcement of
the co-sponsorship at http://www.discovery.org/-
scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&id=-38 EvolDir May 31, 2005
133&program=CSC&isEvent=true
Although the Smithsonian must give non-proﬁt organi-
zations (of which the Discovery Institute is apparently
one) the right to present ﬁlms in its facilities, it seems
wrong for the Smithsonian to also co-sponsor such ﬁlms.
The Smithsonian has a history of supporting the fact
of evolution, and in fact has a wonderful Hall of Evo-
lution in the NMNH to present the data. Why, then,
is it co-sponsoring this ﬁlm? The eﬀect of this is to
give a U.S. government imprimatur to the activities of
the Discovery Institute. The Discovery Institute is of
course playing up this co-sponsorship on its website.
The director of the National Museum of Natual His-
tory, which is co-sponsoring the ﬁlm, is Christian Sam-
per, whose email address is SamperC@si.edu . I would
urge you to consider emailing him and expressing your
feelings about this event.
I am sure that Dr. Samper is not very happy with
this event (apparently the Discovery Institute sneaked
in the ﬁlm under the Museum’s radar), but perhaps a
series of emails from evolutionists could get the Smith-
sonian re-examine its policy of cosponsoring events like
this. Needless to say, we should all be polite in our
emails.
Thanks. Jerry Coyne

Large Allele Dropout
Hello, we are running microsatellites on leaves and seeds
and have two primers where some of the large fragment
size alleles are much reduced in ampliﬁcation as com-
pared to the smaller fragment size allele in the same
individual. At times, ampliﬁcation of the large allele is
so low in comparison to the small allele as to make the
large allele barely noticeable, and it may be dropping
out entirely sometimes.
I’ve tried suggestions from various sources to bring up
the large allele including: Increasing MgCl2, Increas-
ing KCl, decreasing annealing temperature, decreasing
DNA concentration, increasing and decreasing exten-
sion time, decreasing cycle #, and increasing taq. In-
creasing KCl brought up the large allele slightly, so I’m
going to try higher concentrations. While some of the
others increased ampliﬁcation overall, none brought up
the large allele relative to the small allele. Increasing
ampliﬁcation overall is not helpful as I would need tooveramplify the small allele to make the large allele
more visible, and overampliﬁcation will cause ﬂuores-
cence to be picked up by nearby sample capillaries.
Has anyone tried other methods that have been success-
ful in bringing up the large allele relative to the small
allele?

I tested a microsatellite set for cross-utilty among
species within a genus. I detected that microsatellites
of the original species are longer as in cross-ampliﬁed

bias is present. But is there is a statistical test to test
for acertainment bias?

Mountain range population data
Dear EvolDir,
I am working on a method of estimating ’distance’
across mountain ranges. Although this is still in
the preliminary stage, I am now at a point where
I wish to test this method. I am looking for any
published or unpublished datasets where populations
have been studied along mountain systems (on ei-
ther side of mountains and across the system) andMay 31, 2005 EvolDir 39
where genetic, morphological or linguistic distance
have been calculated (or I can calculate from raw
data). To test my method I would need locations of
the populations (or latitude/longitude) and either ge-
netic/morphological/linguistic distance as a matrix or
as a raw ﬁle. If you have any data such as these, I would
be very grateful.
Please contact me if you have any concerns about how
the data would be used or if you have data you may be
able to contribute.

PartitionHomogeneityTest answers
Dear all,
A few days ago, I posted the following query:
“I often use the Partition Homogeneity Test (= ILD) in
PAUP* to test data homogeneity for pylogenetic anal-
yses, but as the number of taxa increases, this rapidly
becomes impossible to use. This is related to the use
of parsimony in this test, even if the principle of PHT

use of parsimony in PHT. Is anyone aware of another
(good) method to test data homogeneity, with an asso-
ciate software or PAUP routine?”
Many people seem to have the same problem. Here are
the putative solutions I received:
- See attachment [Zelwer M and Daubin V; 2004. De-
tecting phylogenetic incongruence using BioNJ: an im-
provement of the ILD test. Mol Phyl Evol 33: 687-693].
Rob Cruickshank
- The test was made for and justiﬁed based on the par-
simony criterion, of course. To make it tractable for
a large dataset, you can use an abbreviated heuristic
search to speed up the analysis of the random partitions
if necessary (i.e., limit the number of trees swapped
using nchuck command, for instance, or use a smaller
number of repetitions using the nrep=5 command, or
even using the parsimony ratchet, though implementing
that might be a chore). This app[roach risks not ﬁnd-
ing the very best tree for each random replicate, which
would have the eﬀect of increasing the variance of your
p-value from its “true” value that you would ﬁnd using
exact searches. However, this approach shouldn’t intro-duce a strong bias that would drive the p-value strongly
up or down, because the failure to ﬁnd the best tree
would be equally likely to aﬀect the partitioned and un-
partitioned length estimates for each replicate, giving
the ILD for each replicate a more-or-less equal chance
of increasing or decreasing.
You should not use an abbreviated search for your test
partition, however, since the accuracy of this length
diﬀerence is critical. You want this estimate to be as
precise as possible.
As for switching to other criteria, the ILD concept could
be adapted to likelihood, but this would be much more
time consuming, so it wouldn’t help you. Huelsen-
beck and Bull have their likelihood-based nonparamet-
ric bootstrap for incongruence, but it is far more com-
putationally intensive than the parsimony ILD. I don’t
know of a clear justiﬁcation for using an ILD-like test
in a distance context, and I would be very wary of such
an approach. The ILD measures conﬂict between and
within data subsets, which has a direct relationship to
length diﬀerence. I don’t know if we can assume that
diﬀerences in total branch lengths (for minimum evolu-
tion criterion) or least-squares-ﬁt or other such distance
measures should be distributed in a similar way under
the null hypothesis of no incongruence, which is what
is required for the ILD test to be valid.

- Did you try Winclada + Nona ( http://-
www.cladistics.com/ )? These programs are faster
than PAUP.
Sophie Qu´ erouil
[My translation]
- 1. I don’t know of a faster optimality criterion than
parsimony. If you’re thinking of neighbor-joining, that
method doesn’t have an optimality criterion, and there-
fore the test can’t be performed on it. I suppose you
could construct a neighbor-joining tree and then eval-
uate the topology under some optimality criterion, ei-
ther least squares or parsimony. Parsimony would still
be the fastest to compute.
2. Are you aware of recent literature showing that the
ILD isn’t a reliable test? In particular, I’m thinking
of Barker, F. K., and F. M. Lutzoni. 2002. Spurious
rejection of phylogenetic congruence by the ILD test:
A simulation study. Syst. Biol. 51:625-637. But there
are other similar papers.

geneity test that can use RELL. RELL is, in this sort
of application, very fast. The required parts are avail-
able in PAUP (the site likelihoods or probabilities of
data patterns) but an R script would be best to put it
all together.

SSR null alleles
Hello, EvolDir,
My lab is increasingly using SSR markers (microsatel-
lites) to address population and conservation questions
for a variety of plant species, and null alleles appear to
be present in the data with some frequency. I am not fa-
miliar with how to account for a null allele in SSR data,
especially when the analysis software requires alleles to
be designated as number of repeats for a step-wise mu-
tation model.
Is there a convention for coding or accounting for null
alleles observed in microsatellite data collected for wild
populations? Can you recommend literature that ad-
dresses this subject?

for a variety of plant species, and null alleles appear to
be present in the data with some frequency. I am not fa-
miliar with how to account for a null allele in SSR data,
especially when the analysis software requires alleles to
be designated as number of repeats for a step-wise mu-
tation model.Is there a convention for coding or accounting for null
alleles observed in microsatellite data collected for wild
populations? Can you recommend literature that ad-
dresses this subject?

Responses:
Yes, nulls are a pain in the neck, and they seem to
be very common in organisms with large Ne – >long
coalescence times.
The ideal is to detect them asap and get technical ﬁxes
to avoid them:
- as a ﬁrst approach, using the least stringent conditions
that give you interpretable results should minimize your
problems
- change PCR conditions
- redesign primers even if you have to sequence some
alleles to ﬁnd suitable primer regions
- drop the locus
The coding of nulls depends on what you are trying to
do. Of course it is important to note the diﬀerence be-
tween a ’deﬁnite’ homozygous null and a failed PCR:
a null homozygote is an individual that gives nothing
when it should have worked (you will know the DNA is
ﬁne at other loci and the locus is reliable, or even bet-
ter than loci are scored in multiplexes that are reliable).
GENEPOP will estimate null allele frequencies as long
as you identify null homozygotes, which must be coded
as the largest allele (so we call them 9999999).
Often there is little justiﬁcation for assuming SMM, and
it is even less likely to apply in taxa with high frequen-
cies of nulls because these may have a lot of indels in
the ﬂanking regions.
The champion ’null’ species of which I am aware (and
we have stumbled over several in my group!) is Scapto-
drosophila hibisci with an impressive 17/20 loci aﬀected
(admittedly in part owing to Stuart Barker’s high stan-
dards of demanding proof that loci do NOT have nulls).

Serum vs plasma
Evoldir:
I have several samples for which all the components of
the blood were separated (i.e. RBC, WBC, Serum, and
Plasma). However, some of the samples have lost their
identifying information over the years stating what part
of the blood the sample came from. I am wondering if
there is a test which can identify plasma vs serum vs
WBC? Additionally, has anyone extracted DNA from
serum or plasma? What was the quantity/quality of
the DNA obtained? I am wondering if it is good enough
quality to perform a multilocus scan.
Thanks in advance

Software Migrate
MIGRATE NEWS: May 2005
New versions and macosx graphical-user interface:
http:// popgen.csit.fsu.edu
(1) Migrate has now a graphical user interface for Ap-
ple Macintosh OS 10.2+ systems. We call the interface
Miggui. The name is spoken Miggi (for english speak-
ers: meeggy), of course it means migrate-graphical-user
interface, but reminds me of a cat we had long time ago
in Switzerland. Carl McIntosh programmed the Graph-
ical User Interface, it is written in Objective-C and is
an independent program that calls the command-line
version of migrate.
Once you downloaded the package, a short guide to
miggui can be found in the directory miggui-short-44 EvolDir May 31, 2005
documentation, double click index.html or in the help
menu of the miggui application. Currently miggui does
not support all possible options in migrate-2.0.6: the
Bayesian portion is currently not implemented and will
come at a later time. This is the ﬁrst release of miggui
and so it will have rough edges and we would like to
hear about these. If you ﬁnd errors, problems, or have
suggestions please email us at miggui@csit.fsu.edu.
(2) A new maintenance release of migrate (now ver-
sion 2.0.6) that removes a few memory leaks (if your
dataset crashed towards after running for a while you
might want to retry with this version)
(3) Because of system-security issues, it gets more
and more diﬃcult for me to maintain migrate
on evolution.gs.washington.edu. As of now if
you go to http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc/-
migrate.html you will be forwarded to my own site

tosh@mac.com) Peter Beerli (beerli@csit.fsu.edu)
P.S. I send you this email because you registered on the

ceive this email, send me a note and I will remove you

Stationarity tests
One more question about stationarity tests.
Note: I will post the collected answers to help those
with similar questions. This is as per common practice
and as listed on the EvolDir website.
And now the question.
Stationarity of nucleotide frequencies is an important
assumption of most sequence evolution models. Al-
though ML tree reconstrucion is to some extent robust
against the violation of underlying assumptions, one
never knows how much violation is actually tolerated
before the method produces wrong results. It is there-
fore good practice to exclude sequences from the analy-
sis whose base compositions deviate too much from the
average.
A popular method to facilitate this decision is a simple
chi-square test which compares the nucleotide distribu-
tion of each sequence with that of the whole data set:
It rejects a sequence if it becomes improbable that the
two distributions are equal. Many people have been us-
ing this test over years and I too have implemented it in
my own software - whithout thinking too much about
it.
The problem is that p-values produced by this method
depend strongly on the sequence lengths. Any natu-
rally evolving sequence which is to some extent oﬀ the
equilibirium will pass the test if it is only short enough,
and any sequence that is long enough will fail - no mat-
ter how good or bad it is. Especially the punishment of
long sequences is bad because ML tree reconstruction
is known to become more and more reliable the longer
the sequences are.
Take a small sequence alignment whose sequences have
passed the chi-square test and concatenate it several
times with itself. You will be surprised that very likely
some of the sequences are being rejected now, though
the phylogenetic information can not have changed.
I am looking for alternatives. Any ideas? Is there a sim-May 31, 2005 EvolDir 45
ple way to check that the base composition in a data
set is or was suitable for tree reconstruction?

Hi Gangolf
Perhaps one way to do this is to use parametric boot-strapping, as follows:
1. Estimate the best (i.e., ML) model of evolution, sta-
tionary frequencies, and tree for a given dataset. 2. Use
the estimated model, frequencies and tree to generate
simulated datasets. 3. Now estimate the distribution
of your Chi-squared statistics using the simulated se-
quences.
You can now assess how each sequence ﬁts against this
distribution.
Of course, this approach is predicated on your choice
of the model that best describes the evolution of the
sequences. The ML rate/tree/frequency estimates of a
less-than-satisfactory model will give an inappropriate
chi-squared distribution.
Be interested to know how this works. Cheers
Allen Rodrigo

Dear Jobb
We developed a Disparity Index test that is more pow-
erful than the Chi-square test for this purpose. This
method can also be used to compute the disparity in-
dex per site, as well. It is implemented in the soft-
ware MEGA ( www.megasoftware.net ) for DNA and
protein sequences and it has been used for analysis of
mammalian DNA and proteins. Relevant references
are given below (note that all pdfs at available at

Hi,46 EvolDir May 31, 2005
My view on how to think about this is as a model selec-
tion problem: We have to choose between a model M0
under which all sequences have the same base compo-
sition, and models M1,... under which some sequences
have diﬀerent base compostions.
It is well known that many classical (p-
value/likelihood/LRT/AIC) model selection methods
are asymptotically inconsistent, meaning that as the
number of i.i.d. observations goes to inﬁnity the
probability of selecting the the right model does not go
to one. In contrast, the Bayes factor and BIC (a.k.a.
Schwarz criterion) are asymptotically consistent.
Note that consistency is an entirely classical concept,
referring to probabilities in repeated sampling under
the same true model. In this sense, Bayesian methods
perform better by a classical criterion.
The BIC is like a LRT/AIC model selection criterion,
but is
BIC = 2 x (lnL(M1) - lnL(M0)) - k ln(n)
where k is the diﬀerence in degrees of freedom of the
two models, and n is the number of i.i.d. observations.
Thus as n gets large we

Wolbachia
I am looking for samples of arthropods of all types that
are maintained as laboratory cultures. I will be testing
them for the presence of Wolbachia. Wolbachia is an
endosymbiotic bacteria that infects somewhere between
20-75% of all arthropod species and manipulates theirMay 31, 2005 EvolDir 47
hosts in a number of ways, most notably by manipulat-
ing reproduction.
If anyone has any arthropods (other than Drosophila
in the melanogaster subgroup) that they maintain and
would be willing to let me test them for Wolbachia,
please write to me at mclark11@mail.rochester.edu. We
can then arrange for easy shipping of material (5-10 fe-
male insects in 95% ethanol is prefered). I will be able
to let you know if your organisms are infected, and if
so, with which Wolbachia strain.
If interested, please email me and I will send you ship-

STRI AvianColonizationGeneticsPostdoc: Genetic variation, divergence, and diﬀerenti-
ation in land bird populations in the West Indies
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
Eldredge Bermingham (Smithsonian Tropical Research
Institute, Panama) and Robert Ricklefs (University of
Missouri St. Louis) are seeking a postdoctoral re-
searcher to collaborate on a molecular population ge-
netic analysis of dispersal, genetic variation, and diﬀer-
entiation of land bird populations in the West Indies.
Our previous molecular phylogeographic work (see list
of publications below) has characterized the history of
the distributions of birds in these islands, and has re-
lated geography and age to habitat distribution and
abundance of individual island bird populations. In
the proposed study, we shall explore genetic variation
in West Indian island bird populations in relation to
history, distribution, and ecology to determine factors
that augment and reduce genetic diversity.
The processes of primary concern are colonization, mi-
gration between islands, and maintenance of genetic
diversity. We address these processes by a combi-
nation of population genetic and phylogeographic ap-
proaches. The contemporary distribution of genetic
variation within a taxon provides clues to important
features of its history: colonization, including the tem-
poral and spatial pattern of a taxon1s spread through
an island chain; evidence of founder eﬀects and popula-
tion bottlenecks in the erosion of the genetic variation
held by the source population; genetic diﬀerentiation
between island populations when migration is too in-
frequent to homogenize the gene pool across islands;
accumulation of new diversity within island populations
through mutation; and attainment of evolutionary in-
dependence, ultimately revealed by ﬁxed genetic diﬀer-
ences between island populations. Laboratory analyses
will be based primarily on nearly 12,000 DNA sam-
ples obtained since 1991 from most of the major is-
lands in the West Indies and continental sites around
the Caribbean Basin. Fieldwork will include additional
sampling in northern Venezuela or Trinidad to charac-
terize genetic variation in source populations more thor-
oughly; on St. Lucia to increase population samples of
uncommon birds and to estimate population densities;
and in the northern Lesser Antilles to sample popula-
tions on very small islands.
We are interested in addressing the following questions:
(1) How much genetic diversity is carried to the is-
lands from continental source populations? Compar-
isons of the genetic diversity between source popula-
tions and undiﬀerentiated (recent) island populations
in the Lesser Antilles would permit estimation of the
size of founder populations. Suitable taxa include54 EvolDir May 31, 2005
Columbina passerina, Elaenia ﬂavogaster, Turdus nudi-
genis, Mimus gilvus, Tiaris bicolor, Quiscalus lugubris.
Molecular markers are likely to include the mitochon-
drial cytochrome B and ATPase 6,8 genes and nuclear
introns (ACO1-I10, FGB-15, MUSK-14, RHO-I, and
TGFB2). Mitochondrial genes have a relatively rapid
nucleotide substitution rate, whereas nuclear genes per-
mit increased power of tests aﬀorded by multiple, un-
linked loci and the 4-fold increase in the eﬀective pop-
ulation size of nuclear compared to mitochondrial loci.
(2) How isolated are island populations? The extent of
migration between island populations can be assessed
by genetic variation within and between populations
using population genetic statistics. Genetic variance
in isolated populations at mutation-drift equilibrium is
proportional to eﬀective population size. A high rate
of migration increases local variance and homogenizes
genetic variation among island populations. Low mi-
gration in recently founded populations is accompanied
by low genetic variance. We aim to compare genetic di-
versity between weakly and strongly diﬀerentiated pop-
ulations in an analysis of variance with island size and
relative abundance as covariates (see 3 below). In ad-
dition to the undiﬀerentiated species listed in objec-
tive 1, taxa with signiﬁcant quantitative genetic dif-
ferentiation of mitochondrial genes within the Lesser
Antilles include Orthorhynchus cristatus, Elaenia mar-
tinica, Myiarchus [stolidus] oberi, Margarops fuscus,
Vireo altiloquus, Dendroica petechia, Coereba ﬂaveola,
and Loxigilla noctis.
(3) How does genetic variation reﬂect the size and ecol-
ogy of populations? Theory developed for mutation-
drift equilibrium predicts a direct relationship between
genetic diversity and eﬀective population size. Popula-
tions that ﬂuctuate greatly in size might exhibit more
(contracting) or less (expanding) genetic variation than
predicted from present size. We have sampled bird
populations in the West Indies on islands ranging in
size from Little Cayman to Hispaniola. We shall com-
pare genetic diversity in genetically diﬀerentiated is-
land populations (to ensure suﬃcient time is allowed
for equilibrium under constant conditions) to island size

UMontreal Hybridization
Hybridization and reticulation in phylogenetic analyses
Project summary: Hybridization is recognized as a fre-
quent and important phenomenon in the evolution of
angiosperms, but also is thought to have played an im-
portant role in the evolution of animals. The methods
of phylogeny reconstruction commonly used in system-
atics represent evolution as strictly dichotomous and
thus do not permit a reliable reconstruction of the phy-
logeny of taxa of hybrid origin. New methods have been
developed to integrate and better represent the position
of hybrid taxa, but these are not commonly used by
biologists and their eﬀectiveness remains to be tested.
In a collaborative project between botanists and zool-
ogists, we are examining the eﬀect of including hybrids
in phylogenetic analyses of plants and animals through
an experimental and theoretical approach.
Objectives: As part of this project, we are searching for
a postdoctoral fellow to participate actively in the fol-
lowing objectives: 1, evaluate the relative performance
of diﬀerent reticulistic methods for detecting hybrids; 2,
compare through simulations methods for representing
reticulations; 3, establish criteria that will allow theselection of the best methods for either detection or
representation and for the type of data available (mor-
phological or molecular, characters or distances, uni-
parental or biparental markers, etc.); and 4, develop
new and eﬀective reticulistic methods for detecting and
representing hybrid taxa.

eukaryotic level on general topics such as molecular evo-
lution, genome evolution and transcriptome evolution.
The Centre will now recruit ﬁve enthusiastic and com-
petitive post-docs broadly within the two areas indi-
cated below.
1. The research group of Siv Andersson studies how mi-
crobial genomes evolve, using the alpha-proteobacteria
as the main model system. The current research fo-
cus is on comparative genome analyses of bacteria that
are endosymbionts of insects or pathogens of humans,
animals and plants. In one project, we use microar-
ray hybridizations to study clinical and environmental
isolates of Bartonella. In another project, we study
Wolbachia, a manipulator of sex ratios in insect pop-
ulations. Metagenomic studies of environmental sam-
ples will also be initiated. The overall aim is to de-
termine the ﬂow of genes within and among lineages
so as to develop models describing microbial genome
evolution. Suitable background may be in microbial
genomics, bioinformatics, or molecular evolution.
Informal inquiries and applications relating to this
research should be addressed to Prof. Siv An-
dersson (Siv.Andersson@ebc.uu.se) See also http://-

A Post Doctoral researcher position is immediately
available at the Linnaeus Center for Bioinformatics in
Uppsala, Sweden ( http://www.lcb.uu.se ). The post is
initially for one year but with a possibility for a prolon-
gation to two years.
The successful applicant will join a multidiciplinary re-
search team focusing on dissection of the genetic archi-
tecture of complex traits. We have been able to show
that epistasis is important in the regulation of complex
traits. Our future goal is to improve our understand-
ing of epistasis and to understand the consequences of
diﬀerent kinds of genetic architecture on selection re-
sponse and evolution. We are therefore looking for a
Post-doctoral researcher to join our group in a project
where we are investigating the population genetic im-
pact of the epistatic interactions.
In our previous research we have developed method-
ology for large scale screening for epistatic QTL in-
volved in regulating complex trait expression. These
tools have been used to study the importance of epis-
tasis in phenotypic evolution using data from diver-
gent crosses between domesticated animals. We have
e.g. explored the role of epistasis in domestication us-

Dear colleague,
we are happy to announce the
Otto Warburg International Summer School and Work-
shop on Networks and Regulation.
August 26 to September 4, 2005
Berlin, GermanyThe aim of this program is to bring together researchers
and students from diﬀerent backgrounds (including
molecular biology, bioinformatics, biological physics) to
discuss Networks and Regulation, a topic of high cur-
rent interest on the interface between statistical physics
and biology. We plan an integrated program, which is
focused on high-level training during the ﬁrst days and
leads to topical research seminars in the second part.
We will discuss ideas and approaches both from physics
and biology. The goal is to promote a joint eﬀort and
establish a common ground to approach problems in
this emerging ﬁeld of research. The schedule will leave
suﬃcient time for discussion and interaction among stu-
dents and lecturers.64 EvolDir May 31, 2005

Course Marine Biological Laboratory & The Institute
for Genome Research October 4 - October 30, 2005
http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/-
special topics/genome.html A comprehensive, four-
week course in Genome Science that will integrate
Bioinformatics with the latest laboratory techniques
for genome sequencing, genome analysis, and high
throughput gene expression (DNA microarrays). A
distinguished faculty from major universities, bioinfor-
matic centers, The Institute for Genomic Research andthe Marine Biological Laboratory will train students
including postdoctoral students, graduate students
and established PI’s. This cutting-edge course will
integrate a series of lectures with laboratory exercises
both at the computer and in a high technology, high
throughput facility. Limited to 24 students.
The major instructional modules include (1) Genome
Sequencing (vector development, library construc-
tion, high throughput sequencing technologies, prin-
ciples of automation using advanced robotic liquid
handlers, genome assembly algorithms and closure
strategies); (2) Bioinformatics (Gene prediction algo-
rithms,annotation, database construction and search-
ing, phylogenetics and molecular evolution); and (3)
Functional Genomics (DNA microarrays, data analy-
sis). In addition, we will sponsor symposia in topical ar-
eas in genome science. Examples of symposia to be of-
fered include: Advances in genome assembly; Genomes
and development; Genome science and environmental
biology; Genome evolution; Impact of genome science
on Drug design; etc. The breadth of topics in genome
science and the advanced training based upon advanced
laboratory technology, distinguish this course from all
other oﬀerings.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.66 EvolDir May 31, 2005
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
