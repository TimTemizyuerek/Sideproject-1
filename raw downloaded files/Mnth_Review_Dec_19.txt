Genomes to Application"
will be held in Frankfurt am Main from 26.-28.02.2020 at
the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History
Museum and the registration is now open!
The conference series Annual Meetings in Conservation
Genetics was launched in 2015 to help bridging the gap
between modern genetic/genomic research and applied
nature and species conservation. The conference serves
as a platform both for experts as well as others inter-
ested in applying modern genetic and genomic tools for
conservation. We will have dierent sessions on diverse
topics such as eDNA, molecular wildlife forensics or
landscape genetics, and workshops on topics such as
policy, society & outreach.
The meeting is intended for scientists in the elds of
conservation genetics, ecological genomics, and related4 EvolDir December 1, 2019
elds, and researchers, students, conservationists and
environmental managers interested in applying conser-
vation genetics and genomics .

Helsinki EvolutionInsectViruses
Jul19-24
We would like to invite submissions to two symposia ad-
dressing the vast increase in insect virus discovery that
has taken place in recent years. The symposia will be
held during the International Congress of Entomology
(ICE 2020), Helsinki, Finland, July 19-24, 2020.
The symposia will be held consecutively on Thursday
July 23rd, 2020, and aim to bring together recent con-
tributions to insect virus discovery, with a focus on
evolutionary and/or ecological implications.
Symposium 1: Ecological implications of the recent huge
increase in insect virus discovery (organised by Elisabeth
Herniou and Jenny Cory): High throughput sequencing
has accelerated virus discovery and notably in insects.
Many new insect species are now associated with a di-
verse range of viruses, many of which were previously
unknown and belong to undescribed viral families. Each
new discovery adds new potential interactions in the
ecological network of any focal hosts at multiple trophic
levels. This calls for rethinking our understanding of
host-pathogen interactions in a broader ecological and
evolutionary context at the cellular, organismal, com-
munity level.
Submissions through this link: https://-submit.peerageofscience.org/conference/ICE 2020/-
109474 Symposium 2: The evolution of insect-virus
associations (organised by Dino McMahon and Vera
Ros): Our ability to characterize and understand
the biology of insect-virus associations has risen
dramatically in recent years following the advent of
accessible omics approaches. This progress is timely
given the vital and growing importance of insects to
global ecosystems and wildlife and human health. Our
symposium welcomes new research that is mechanistic
as well as ecological in scope, focusing on the diversity,
evolution and origin of insect viruses, their spread
within and between species and the evolution of
virulence in the context of dynamic host virus defenses
and changing environments.
Submissions through this link: https://-
submit.peerageofscience.org/conference/ICE 2020/-

two symposia: December 15, 2020.

Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre,
Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists??? Forum represents
an exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration isFREE.
Send applications by e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com , supply-
ing your name, contact address and stating whether
or not you wish to give an oral or poster presenta-
tion.Please also tell us your academic stage ??? e.g.,
Masters, PhD or postdoc.Space will be allocated subject
to availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English and in
Word format no later than Friday 25 October 2019. The
body text should not exceed 150 words in length. Ti-
tle, authors, and their professional aliations/addresses

(poster) must be clearly indicated in BOLD text. The
le should be in editable format (.doc or .odt, not pdf)
and titled Surname First-name YSF2019.doc, for exam-
ple Doe Jane YSF2019.doc.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as6 EvolDir December 1, 2019
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

Subject: Call for Proposals to Host SMBE 2023 - Dead-
line 30 November 2019
Dear SMBE Members:
Want to meet like-minded colleagues from all over the
world?
Wish you could have an international conference in your
eld closer to home?
SMBE is looking for a local host for its 2023 interna-
tional meeting. Informal expressions of interest should
be from a prospective local organizing committee of sci-
entists headed by an SMBE member, and should reach
SMBE President-Elect Marta Wayne by 30 November
2019. Full proposals will need to be submitted using the
SMBE template by 30 April 2020. Please email your
proposal to Smbe.contact@gmail.com.
For details of meeting organization, please see the SMBE
Conference Guidelines (https://www.smbe.org/smbe/-
MEETINGS/ConferenceGuidelines.aspxand specically
Appendix 2 which outlines the format of proposals).
The primary role of the local organizing committee will
be to plan the scientic programme. All other aspects of
the organization will be done in association with SMBE
representatives and a professional conference organizer
appointed by SMBE.
SMBE rotates its meetings geographically to encourage
international participation. For 2023, we are particu-
larly requesting proposals from North America. The
next three years' meetings will be in Quebec, Canada
(2020), Auckland, NZ (2021) and Ferrera, Italy (2022).
Please note that SMBE is not interested in proposals
from professional conference organizers.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Marta Wayne President-Elect, SMBE

AuburnU EvoDevo
The Range lab in the Department of Biological Sciences
at Auburn University is recruiting graduate students
interested in evolutionary and developmental biology
(www.therangelab.com). Research in the lab focuses on
understanding how an interconnected network of three
dierent Wnt signaling pathways (Wnt/Beta-catenin,
Wnt/JNK, and Wnt/Ca2+) coordinate the exact po-
sitions of the gene regulatory networks that establish
the primary germ layers along the anterior-posterior
axis during early embryogenesis. We use sea urchin
and hemichordate (acorn worm) embryos as the primary
model systems. Remarkably, functional and expression
studies in many metazoans (vertebrates, urochordates,
hemichordates, echinoderms and cnidarians) suggest
that many aspects of this Wnt signaling network gov-
erning AP axis specication is an ancient mechanism
that existed in the common ancestor of bilaterians and
cnidarians. We also work closely with the Counterman
lab at nearby Mississippi State University to study how
Wnt signaling is involved in buttery wing pattern devel-
opment. In collaboration, we have begun to characterize
the Wnt network of signaling governing pigmentary and
structurally based color patterns.
The position is for a talented PhD student beginning
in the Fall of 2020. The student will have the choice to
work on any number of projects in the lab that focus
on the roles of Wnt signaling during early AP axis spec-
ication and patterning in sea urchin and hemichordate
embryos. The student will also have opportunities to
contribute to our collaboration with the Counterman lab.
The position oers training in a combination of molecu-
lar manipulations, high-throughput genome-wide assays
and bioinformatics, gene regulatory network analysis as
well as classical embryology.
Auburn University is situated in the quintessential col-
lege town of Auburn, Alabama and is located close to
several major cities (e.g. Atlanta [1.25 hrs] and Birming-
ham [2 hrs]), the beaches along the Gulf of Mexico and
Atlantic Ocean, and the Appalachian Mountains. You
can learn more about the Department of Biological Sci-
ences at Auburn University at http://www.auburn.edu/-
cosam/departments/biology/ . Interested applicants
should contact Dr. Ryan Range at range@auburn.edu.
With your inquiry, please include a CV and a brief de-
scription of your research interests and experience. GRE
scores are not required by the Department of BiologicalSciences at Auburn. Applications for Fall 2020 are ac-
cepted until February 1st, 2020. In-person interviews at
Auburn are available. There will be a graduate student
recruitment hosted by the Department of Biological Sci-
ences from January 21st - 23rd for interested students
if they contact Dr. Range before December 31st, 2019.

aect dispersal and genetic diversity in invasive species?
Supervisors: Aaron Comeault (Bangor University), Kris-
ten Crandell (Bangor University), Alex Papadopulos
(Bangor University), and Si Creer (Bangor University)
Project Description
What are the factors that facilitate successful biological
invasions? This question has been a central focus in
invasion ecology and genetics for over a half-century,
and has important ramications for the eective man-
agement of invasive species. The ultimate goal of this
project is to generate novel insight into the dynamics of
biological invasions. The successful candidate will work
at the interface of biomechanics and genomics to test
timely questions in invasive species biology: What are
the functional links between dispersal traits and genetic
diversity in invasive species? How do dispersal traits
dier between invasive and non-invasive species? And
how does dispersal aect the spread of invasive species
into novel habitats? To answer the questions described
above, the student will collect phenotypic and genomic
data from wild species of invasive and native Drosophilid
fruit ies. The successful candidate will work at the in-
terface between biomechanics and population genomics
to perform integrative tests of the functional links be-
tween ight morphology, dispersal ability, and genetic
diversity. Results will inform invasive species manage-
ment by establishing direct links between morphology,
dispersal, and genetic diversity. A resulting goal is to
generate simple predictive tools for invasive propensity
and management practices for ongoing invasions.
Training Outcomes
The studentship comes with the opportunity to develop
marketable skills in big data science by learning and
applying cutting-edge methods in the elds of biome-
chanics and population genomics. The successful candi-
date will also have the opportunity to conduct eldwork,
and travel extensively across the UK to sample dierent
species of invasive and native Drosophila. Hosted inthe Molecular Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Labora-
tory group (MEFGL), the student will be exposed to
a diverse and vibrant research environment, conduct-
ing research elds ranging from molecular ecology and
conservation genetics to evolution and speciation. Be-
cause of the interdisciplinary nature of this project, the
successful candidate will have the opportunity to ex-
plore and develop their independent research interests
in diverse areas of expertise.

Vincent Richards' lab in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Clemson University is accepting applications
for a PhD position.
The overarching research theme will focus on the oral
microbiome and the relationship between the bacterial
and fungal components of this community. Specic
questions include how these taxa respond and adapt to
this dynamic environment. Operating over numerous
time scales, multiple host factors such as diet, health,
disease, and host genotype can impact the oral envi-
ronment and hence are strong evolutionary forces that
can shape and select for changes within the commu-
nity. We are particularly interested in the interplay and
co-evolution of bacterial and fungal components of the
community and how these processes are impacted by

EvolutionaryConservationGenomics
PhD in Evolutionary/Conservation Genomics
The Hare Lab in the Department of Natural Resources
at Cornell University is recruiting a PhD student to
study evolutionary biology and conservation genomics
with the eastern oyster as a study system. Desired start
is Summer/Fall 2020.
The Hare Lab studies ecological and evolutionary fac-
tors that aect population responses to environmental
change over timescales relevant to conservation and
management. Some of our research also entails the
application of genetic markers to inform population
biology and ecology. The eastern oyster has been a
longstanding focus of the Hare Lab because of its fasci-
nating biology, keystone ecosystem function, strong and
growing aquaculture industry interest, and the need to
improve restoration success. The recent assembly of a
chromosome scale reference genome has enabled highly
informative genomic approaches to our studies. Oyster
projects in the Hare Lab currently include tests for local
adaptation, measurement of selection in the lab and
eld, tests for domestication selection in breeding pro-
grams, measurement of introgression from aquaculture
to wild oysters, genomics of stress tolerance at dierent
life stages, and mapping of larval dispersal patterns.
These studies involve eld collections, eld experiments,
aquatic lab experiments, population genomic analyses
and outreach with stakeholders.
The exact project will be developed together with the
selected candidate, depending on their interests. We
seek a student with a strong academic record including
courses in evolution, genetics, and quantitative analysis
(stats, modeling). Desirable skills include R, computer
programming, and bioinformatics, as well as knowledge
of invertebrate biology, marine biology, and/or conser-
vation biology. Previous research experience is needed.
The Hare Lab currently has one PhD student, one MS
student, a pedagogy-focused postdoc, a research postdoc
being recruited, and multiple undergraduate research
assistants. Funding is from diverse sources including
the National Science Foundation, New York Sea Grant,
Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, and Cor-nell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. Our home in
the Natural Resources graduate eld ensures continual
multidisciplinary interactions. The Natural Resources
graduate eld includes faculty from across campus who
address the social and ecological dimensions of natural
resources and the environment to improve environmen-
tal sustainability. Conservation genomics is a strength
within Natural Resources (Hare and Therkildsen labs),
and population genomics applied to nonmodel as well as
experimental model systems is a strength across campus.
That strength is represented and reinforced by the Cor-
nell Center for Comparative and Population Genomics
(http://3cpg.cornell.edu/).
Interested applicants should contact Matt Hare at
mph75@cornell.edu as soon as possible and send (1)
an updated CV, (2) a summary of your academic
and research experiences, and (3) a short description
of the research questions you are passionate about.

CRAG Barcelona AncientDNA
PhD position available on Paleaogenomics of dog popu-
lation in Europe.
The Botigue lab for \Genomics of ancient crops and
domestication" in the Centre for Research in Agricul-
tural Genomics (CRAG) in Barcelona is oering a PhD
position under the La Caixa Foundation INPhINIT
Programme to work on the genomic analysis of archae-
ological dog remains from Europe spanning from the
Neolithic up to the Roman Period with the goal to un-
derstand population dynamics within the continent and
gene ow during that period.
DEADLINE 4 February 2020 (Incoming modality) 26
February 2020 (Retaining modality)
TITLE: Genomic analysis of archaeological dog remains16 EvolDir December 1, 2019
from Europe.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The European continent
has played a major role in dog domestication. A re-
cent genomic analysis of Neolithic dogs from Germany
(Botigue et al. 2017 Nature Communications), though
revealing genetic continuity, showed complex admixture
patterns, including gene ow from a population similar
to modern Indian dogs. Additionally, studies examining
the mitochondrial genome of ancient and modern dogs
have detected a replacement in Europe that took place
some time between the Neolithic and the Middle Age.
In the present project we plan to unravel this complex
demographic scenario of prehistoric European dogs by
analysing the genome of more than 30 ancient dog sam-
ples from the Iberian Peninsula and Germany from a
period of over 4,000 years spanning from the Neolithic
up to the Roman Empire. Analysis of the whole genome
and the mitochondrial genome will be performed to de-
termine the main demographic events that shaped dog
populations during that period. Population structure
and admixture will be studied in ancient dogs in the
context of modern dog variation.
As a result, we will provide for the rst time insights
into the genetic structure, variability and admixture of
dog populations in Europe over a period of 4 millennia,
prior the generation of breeds. Results will elucidate de-
mographic events surrounding dog prehistory in Europe
and their relationship with humans migrating through
the continent.
JOB POSITION DESCRIPTION The dearth and the
ambition of the current project are ideal for a PhD
candidate. We are therefore looking for a highly moti-
vated student seeking to pursue his doctoral studies and
specialise in genomics and bioinformatics by analysing
whole genome sequenced data, including that from ar-
chaeological samples. The student will receive extensive
training in a broad range of skills, including theoretical
population genetics and biostatistics, learning concepts
such as population structure, admixture and adaptation,
and recognize the footprints these processes leave in the
genome. Additionally, the student will also learn how to
model demographic inference, gaining knowledge about
coalescent theory and computational simulations. In or-
der to analyse genomic data, the student will learn how
to use and develop bioinformatic tools. This project is
an international collaboration with researchers from the
United States and Germany, so stays abroad are granted,
giving the student a chance to meet and work with peers
and learn new skills from renowned population geneti-
cists. Opportunities to assist international meetings and
present the research done will also be granted through-
out the PhD. The PhD will be performed in CRAG'S
Plant and Animal Genomics programme. During therst year of their studies, students receive teaching on
state-of-the art technologies oered by the Core Units
and Scientic Services of CRAG, such as genomics and
next generation sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics,
and bioinformatics. The student will also be able to
attend internal and external seminars at CRAG and
improve her oratory skills by giving seminars regularly.
By the end of the PhD, the student will have become a
population geneticist specialised in the analysis of mod-
ern and ancient genomes with a strong computational
background and a wide network of peers.
REQUIREMENTS The doctoral fellowship programme
INPhINIT \la Caixa" is devoted to attracting talented
Early-Stage Researchers of any nationality who wish
to pursue doctoral studies in Spanish or Portuguese
territory.
The doctoral INPhINIT fellowships oer a highly com-
petitive salary and complementary opportunities for
training on transferrable skills (through the collabo-
ration of leading entities such as Vitae and Oxentia),
temporary stays in industry, incentives upon completion
of the thesis, among other elements that make these
fellowships some of the most attractive and complete in
Europe.

Eawag UBern FishMigrationEvol
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is a Swiss-based and internationally
networked aquatic research institute within the ETH
Domain (Swiss Federal Institute of Science and Technol-
ogy). It is committed to the ecologically, economically
and socially responsible management of water resources
and aquatic ecosystems.
The Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution (FishEc)
located in Kastanienbaum (Lucerne) has a vacancy for a
PhD student in Evolutionary Ecology of Fish Migration
Applicants should have or anticipate nishing an MSc
or similar before the summer 2020 in a relevant eld of
biology, ecology, or environmental science and a strong
interest in evolutionary ecology, life history variation,
and animal/sh migration.
Movement is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of
animals, and the movement of individual organisms
is integral for many vital ecological and evolutionary
processes. Migration is one of nature?s most spectac-
ular forms of animal movement and has a long and
illuminating scientic history, with exciting new discov-
eries year after year. Centuries of research on animal
migration have highlighted that migratory individuals
most often show distinct adaptations to the migratory
travel and prot from temporally changing relative ben-
ets of alternative habitats. However, being migratory
also means experiencing natural selection in at least
two dierent habitats, which dier between populations.
Unfortunately, our knowledge on adaptation to a mi-
gratory life style is typically limited to adaptation to
the migratory travel per se and we are only starting to
understand the migratory diversity within- and between
meta-populations. Such knowledge is crucially needed
in order to understand the ecological dynamics of nat-
ural selection over space and time and for sustainable
management of populations and diversity.The current project aims to investigate diversity of par-
tially migratory brown trout meta-populations around
the largest lakes in Switzerland. Hundreds of brown
trout populations around the twenty largest Swiss lakes
perform partial migrations from their natal streams to
the foraging ground in the lakes, before returning to
their natal streams for reproduction. Populations dier
in their timing of migration, e.g. in terms of years spent
in stream before migration, years spent in the lake before
rst return migration and seasonal timing, and in their
foraging ecology in the lake environment. This variation
is expected to be partly plastic and ontogenetic and
partly genetically determined.
Our study system allows testing for drivers of diver-
sity within populations, between populations within a
meta-population and between meta-populations. The
PhD-student will analyse this diversity with a combi-
nation of age/growth-, dietary- and genetic analyses
and will additionally conduct PIT tag studies to track
migration patterns and survival of juvenile brown trout.
The project is linked to an applied project on structure
and management of partially migratory trout popula-
tions, which generates a number of synergies and allows
for knowledge transfer from basic scientic questions
to management. The PhD-student will focus on the
scientic questions in the project.
The position is funded for four years and will be hosted
by the River Fish Ecology group, led by Dr. Jakob
Brodersen (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/-
shec/main-focus/river-sh-ecology/) within the FishEc
Department (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/-
shec/) and the Section of Aquatic Ecology at
University of Bern (http://www.aqua.iee.unibe.ch/).
Excellent communication and writing skills in English
and ability to work in a team are essential. Communi-
cation skills in German and/or French is a benet, but
not a requirement for the position.
The work place is at Eawag?s Center for Ecology, Evo-
lution and Biogeochemistry (CEEB) in Kastanienbaum,
Lucerne, which besides the Fish Ecology and Evolution
Department hosts research group from the Department
Surface Waters ? Research & Management and oers

friendly international working climate and a strong cross-
disciplinary research environment. Both departments
within CEEB share a common interest in understanding
the principles of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems
and their susceptibility and adaptability to changing
environments, and a common concern for sustainable
management of ecosystems and biodiversity. Each de-
partment on its own aims at contributing cutting edge
science to the development of theory in ecology, evo-
lution and environmental sciences. Building on theDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 19
synergies that emerge between these elds, the CEEB

Edinburgh InsectHermaphroditism
Dear all,
I am looking for a talented and enthusiastic evolution-
ary/molecular biologist or entomologist for a 4-year
PhD position in my lab http://lauraross.bio.ed.ac.uk
at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of
Edinburgh. There are funding options for both UK
and international students. If you are interested please
contact me directly (laura.ross@ed.ac.uk) to discuss.
Deadlines vary depending on funding source: 13th of
December for non-UK, 9th of January for UK, but please
contact me at least a week before the ocial deadline if
interested!
The evolution of hermaphroditism in insects
Summary Organisms reproduce in diverse ways. Yet it is
unclear why and how new reproductive strategies evolve.
This project focuses on the only case of hermaphroditism
in insects: In species of the scale insect Icerya, female-
like hermaphrodites produce both sperm and eggs and
self-fertilize.
Project background Understanding why there is such
variability in the way organisms reproduce is one the
most important unsolved puzzles in evolutionary biology.
This project aims to tackle this question by focusing
on the unique and puzzling reproductive strategy of
the scale insect Icerya purchasi. This species is the
only insect unequivocally described as hermaphroditic;
female-like hermaphrodites can produce both sperm and
eggs and self-fertilize. But how can a female produce
sperm? A recent hypothesis suggests that the sperm
present in hermaphrodites seem to have originated from
the individuals father \infecting" his future ospring
with sperm-producing cells. However although the data
is suggestive, this hypothesis requires further scrutiny.
It is also unclear why, while most ospring develop as
hermaphrodites, a small number develop as males. Fi-
nally it seems that while hermaphroditism is exceedinglyrare in insects, it might have evolved independently in
several close relatives of Icerya. This PhD project will
explore how and why this unusual reproductive system
evolved by using comparative methods across species
as well as experimental and genomic analyses in the
laboratory. Together this work will help us to better
understand what evolutionary forces shape the ways
animals reproduce.
Research questions The projects sets out to test a num-
ber of key questions to better understand the evolution
of the only insect hermaphrodite:
* What is the evolutionary and developmental origin of
the sperm produced by female-like hermaphrodites? *
Hermaphrodites can self-fertilize, so why and how do
they occasionally produce male ospring? * How fre-
quently did hermaphroditism evolved within the clade of
insects and do any ecological factors predict the patterns
we observe?
Methodology The project will use two main approaches:
The rst will focus on collecting insect specimens of
dierent Icerya species, and then use molecular phyloge-
netic methods to determine their evolutionary relation-
ships, and to study transitions between reproductive
strategies employed by the dierent species. This part
of the project is in collaboration with Prof. Penny Gul-
lan, The Australian National University, Canberra. The
second part of the project will focus on Icerya purchasi.
We will use laboratory experiments and a combination
of cytogenetic and genomic approaches to study dierent
aspects of the reproduction of this species.
Training A comprehensive training programme will be
provided comprising both specialist scientic training
and generic transferable and professional skills. Speci-
cally the student will undertake training in the use of
molecular wet lab techniques, the analysis of sequenc-
ing data and the use of microscopy and cytogenetic
approaches.
Requirements Candidates must be highly motivated
with a keen interest in evolutionary biology and genetics
and a strong motivation to pursue a scientic career.
Previous experience working with insects and phyloge-
netic and genomic analyses would be advantageous.

ETH Zurich BacterialAdaptation
PhD position in Experimental Evolution
The recently formed group of Dr. Macarena Toll-Riera
is seeking a PhD student to study bacterial adaptation
to environmental changes through the combination of ex-
perimental and high-throughput sequencing approaches.
We are hosted at the Institute of Integrative Biology
(ETH Zurich), in the Professorship of Evolutionary Bi-
ology.
Project background Environments are under constant
change and one of the main strategies that organisms
have to respond to these changes is through evolutionary
adaptations. Although evolutionary adaptations have
been studied for long time, the genetic bases underpin-
ning them are still not fully understood.
Most research done to understand how organisms adapt
to changes in their environments has been done using
model organisms. In this project, instead, we propose
to study this question using a bacterium isolated from
Antarctica. To survive to the harsh conditions found
in cold environments, this bacterium has a unique set
of adaptations that makes it a very interesting model
organism to study the molecular mechanisms that can
facilitate, or limit, adaptation to novel environments.
Job description The candidate will investigate the role
that enzyme promiscuity and large genome duplications
have on facilitating adaptation to environmental changes.
As a proxy to environmental change, she/he will use a
large array of carbon sources and will perform laboratory
evolution experiments to challenge bacteria to adapt
to novel environments. She/he will couple laboratory
evolution experiments to next generation sequencing to
disentangle which are the genetic changes underlyingDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 21
adaptation.
We oer 4 years of funding and to be part of a small, but
collaborative and dynamic group. We are hosted at the
Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH Zurich. The can-
didate will benet from a vibrant and interdisciplinary
academic environment with excellent opportunities for
education, training and collaboration. Aside from the
high quality of life, Zurich provides easy access to out-
door activities.
Your prole The successful candidate should hold a mas-
ter degree in a relevant area such as evolutionary biology,
microbiology or genomics, have a genuine interest in evo-
lutionary biology and have a good command of English.
Wet-lab experience, ideally in microbiology, program-
ming skills and experience analysing next-generation
sequencing data are an asset.
The candidate should be highly motivated, enthusiastic,
curious and able to work independently but also as a
team member.
Interested? We look forward to receiving your applica-
tion with the following documents: motivation letter,
CV, academic records, and contact information for 2-
3 potential references. Please send your application
(one single PDF le) by email to Macarena Toll-Riera
(macarena.toll@env.ethz.ch). We will start to revise ap-

Europe MEME MasterProgramme
MEME: Application Cohort 2020 open
MEME (Erasmus Mundus Master in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy) is a two-year research oriented master program for
talented and motivated students who are interested in
understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet inthe past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four European
universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands; Uni-
versity of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians Uni-
versity of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University, Swe-
den), have joined forces with Harvard University (USA)
and the University of Lausanne as associate partners.
Together, this consortium has put together an attrac-
tive multidisciplinary program that meets the highest
standards. All students have to study at (at least) two
partner universities, and they will receive a double de-
gree from two partner universities they have attended.
A limited number of EMJMD scholarships are avail-
able for the highest ranked students. Details on the
program and the selection procedure can be found on
www.evobio.eu . Starting date: 1 September 2020 Ap-
plication deadline: 15 January 2020

Ghent University PhD position on the mechanisms and
consequences of low sex in seaweed populations.
Description The Phycology research group (Olivier De
Clerck's lab) is looking for a highly motivated PhD stu-
dent for a project focusing on the eect of life cycle
variation on genome organization, evolution and adapta-
tion. The focus of the project is on seaweed populations(Dictyota) that display varying degrees of sexual versus
asexual reproduction. The relative degree of sexual or
asexual reproduction, likely determined by dierences in
sea surface temperature, should reect on population ge-
netic parameters and on the ecacy of natural selection.
Using a combination of laboratory experiments, genetic
data of natural populations and transcriptomic data,
this project will 1) determine the precise mechanisms
of asexual reproduction in Dictyota dichotoma; and 2)
evaluate the consequences of mating system variation
between Atlantic (sexual) and Mediterranean (largely
asexual) populations on the genetic structure of the
populations, the ecacy of selection and the adaptive
potential of the populations.

NematodeGenomics
Genomic analysis of the parasitic nematode Phas-
marhabditis hermaphrodita (and other wild Phas-
marhabditis species) - a biological control agent of slugs
Project Description
Understanding the genetic determinants of key traits
in parasitic organisms provides important tools for de-
veloping novel pest control products. Slugs are seri-
ous pests in agriculture and a persistent problem for
home gardens. They are commonly controlled using
pesticide pellets, but as these can have negative eects
on non-target organisms, including pets and wildlife,
a more sustainable and ecologically sound alternative
was developed. This is the nematode Phasmarhabditis
hermaphrodita, a facultative parasite of slugs and snails.
P. hermaphrodita was formulated into a biological con-
trol agent (Nemaslug ^A) by BASF Agricultural Special-
ties for use by farmers and gardeners and since 1994
has been used regularly in the U.K. and Europe, pro-
vide signicant protection against slugs. However, there
are reports that P. hermaphrodita cannot kill larger
pestiferous slug species. In order to better understand
key traits such as virulence, longevity, stress tolerance
and dispersal to improve the Nemaslug ^A product, the
student will apply cutting-edge genomic technologies to
sequence the genomes of P. hermaphrodita (Nemaslug ^A)
and other Phasmarhabditis species isolated from the
wild. The student will undertake genomic analyses of
these nematodes, including genome assembly and an-
notation and comparative genomic analysis with other
nematodes.
i) Whole genome sequencing and annotation of Phas-
marhabditis hermaphrodita
The genome of the strain of P. hermaphrodita currently
used in the production of Nemaslug ^A (called DMG0001)
will be sequenced using a combination of long read (Pa-
cic BioSciences) and short read (Illumina) sequencing
technologies. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing
will also be done to aid gene annotation. The student
will assemble and annotate the genome. In addition to
this reference genome for P. hermaphrodita, 10 strains
recently isolated from the wild and kept in culture at
LJMU will be re-sequenced and mapped to the reference
genome for population and evolutionary genomic anal-
ysis. Candidate genes involved in virulence, longevityand stress tolerance will be tested in lab experiments
carried out in parallel.
ii) Whole genome sequencing of other Phasmarhabditis
species (P. californica and P. neopapillosa) isolated from
the wild
In addition to P. hermaphrodita, the student will se-
quence the genomes of other Phasmarhabditis species,
allowing comparative analyses of the genetics of vir-
ulence and other traits. 5 P. neopapillosa and 3 P.
californica wild isolates currently in culture in LJMU
will be sequenced (genomes and transcriptomes), assem-
bled and annotated as for P. hermaphrodita. A genome
exploration system will be developed to allow browsing
and further investigation.
Ultimately, this project will provide the tools to enable
genomic/genetic improvement of P. hermaphrodita as
a biological control agent, as well as investigating the
potential of other Phasmarhabditis species to be devel-
oped as alternative products. The project will provide
an excellent opportunity for the student to apply state-
of-the-art genome bioinformatics tools and technologies
to advance knowledge of and improve an important
biological pest control tool.
Qualications/ Skills Required:
The candidate requires a 2:1 degree or above in a rel-
evant subject area. A relevant MSc qualication is
desirable, but not essential.
The candidate must have experience in bioinformatics.
The project will suit a candidate with a rm knowledge
of genomics and computational biology. Practical wet-
lab experience and the ability to work independently
are desirable, as is a knowledge and understanding of
parasitology, particularly nematology.
Full training will be provided to the candidate along
with access to the broad knowledge and expertise held
by the supervisory team.
Deadline:
The deadline for submission of applications is midnight
of 22/11/2019
Funding Notes This studentship is funded by BASF.
Only UK & EU citizens can apply for this studentship.
Funding will consist of full tuition fees for three years
and the award of a living stipend at UK Research Coun-
cil rates. References Informal enquiries are welcome.

the following approved CSC-KULeuven PhD topic:
Rapid evolution of tolerance to pesticides under warm-
ing in an aquatic invertebrate and its gut microbiome
Pollutants and warming are among the two most impor-
tant anthropogenic stressors, moreover many pollutants
are more toxic at higher temperatures. We will study
two interrelated research topics to improve risk assess-
ment, and more general to advance the emerging eld of
multi-stressor ecology. First, using powerful experimen-
tal evolution trials we will select for increased toleranceDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
to a pollutant, to warming, and to their combination.
To obtain mechanistic insights this will be combined
with targeted analyses of the expression levels of genes
known to be important in tolerance against each stressor
separately. Second, we will study whether the rapid evo-
lution of tolerance is causally associated with shifts in
the gut microbiome communities. We will address these
innovative research topics at the interface of ecotoxicol-
ogy, global change biology and microbiology using the
water ea Daphnia magna, a keystone species in aquatic
food webs and a model organism in ecotoxicology, evo-
lutionary biology and ecological genomics.

The Evans lab in the Biology Department at McMaster
University is looking for graduate students interested in
studying sex determination in amphibians to start in

We combine approaches in bioinformatics, gene editing,

sex determination in African clawed frogs (Xenopus),
including what genes trigger sexual dierentiation, why
these genes evolve rapidly and vary among species, and
how these genes inuence evolution of sex chromosomes
and sex-related genetic pathways. A major eort in the
lab is to use gene editing to test function of putative
genetic triggers for sex determination, and transgenesis
to insert a known genetic trigger for sex determination
from one species into the genome of other species that
lack this genetic trigger. In this way, our work aims to
better understand \how important things evolve".

MichiganStateU FishEvoDevoGeno
PhD Positions in Fish Evolutionary Developmental Ge-
nomics
The Fish Evo Devo Geno Lab (PI: Ingo Braasch) at
Michigan State University is recruiting highly motivated
PhD students interested in working on the genomic ba-
sis of vertebrate evolution and development to start in
Summer/Fall 2020.
The Braasch Lab focuses on genomic and developmental
changes that contribute to major transitions during the
course of vertebrate evolution and studies evolutionary
novelties at the levels of genome structure, gene family
evolution, and gene regulation. We combine sequencing
and comparative analyses of sh genomes with analy-
ses of molecular evolution and functional genetic and
developmental approaches (CRISPR genome editing,
transgenics, gene expression analyses, epigenomic pro-
ling) in a variety of model species (zebrash, spotted
gar, medaka, killish, and others).
Graduate projects fall within the following broader re-
search areas of the group:
1. Genomic and morphological evolution of shes: How
do morphological dierences among sh and other ver-
tebrate lineages arise from diversication of gene reper-
toires? What is the role of gen(om)e duplications and
gene losses in generating phenotypic diversity? How do
changes in gene regulation contribute to evolutionary
novelties and key innovations? We study a number of
gene families that are of particular importance for the
evolution of the vertebrate body plan, e. g. genes in-
volved in development of the vertebrate-specic neural
crest cells.
2. Conquest of land and 'sh-out-of-water': We are
studying genomic changes and their functional conse-
quences leading to the evolution of tetrapods from shes
and other 'sh-out-of-water' scenarios, including the evo-
lutionary loss of genes at the water-to-land transition
and the gene regulatory basis of hatching.
3. Evolutionary genomic analyses of zebrash and other
biomedical sh models: Combining genomic sequence
comparisons, gene expression analyses and epigenomic
proling, we aim to improve connectivity of teleost
biomedical sh models such as zebrash, medaka, killi-
shes, etc. to human biology and disease. This work is
support by funds from the NIH.For additional information on our research, see
also Braasch et al. 2016, Nature Genetics

VerGE) that includes labs working on vertebrate and
sh evolution, genomics, development, population genet-
ics, neuroscience, behavior, ecology, and conservation,
allowing for vibrant exchange among elds, methods
and model systems.
Qualications: Applicants should hold a bachelor's de-
gree in biology, genetics, genomics, molecular biology,
bioinformatics, developmental biology, zoology or re-
lated elds. Suitable candidates should be enthusiastic
about working in an interdisciplinary manner and have
a passion for sh/vertebrate biology and evolution. Pre-
vious research experience in a relevant area is desired,
but not required.

MichiganStateU WeedEvolution
Job Description: The Patterson lab at Michigan State
University is looking for a PhD student interested in
genome evolution and how novel variation can be gener-
ated during periods of intense abiotic stress over short
generational timescales. Students will develop inde-
pendent dissertation projects that explore how human
selection can change weedy genomes in agroecosystems
and what that might mean for the future of weed control.
Applications received before January 1st, 2019 will be
given full consideration.
Lab Description: Dr. Patterson's research program
utilizes the most current techniques in genomics to un-
derstand the structure and plasticity of weedy genomes
and how that plasticity inuences the success of weedy
species. We are especially interested in how genome
rearrangements (i.e. transposable elements and copy
number variation) form and are utilized as novel sources
of genetic variation for weed adaptation to abiotic
stresses. We also work on herbicides and how they
aect plant physiology and how resistance evolves on
rapid timescales in weedy species. We also work to gen-
erate genomic resources for the weed science community
and to discover the molecular mechanisms of resistance.
Requirements: A B.S. in Botany, Genetics, Agronomy,
Evolutionary Biology or related eld.

MPI Ploen Evolution tRNASets
PhD position: Exploring the evolutionary fate of emer-
gent tRNA genes in bacteria
A fully funded, three-year PhD position is available
in the Microbial Evolutionary Dynamics Group at the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (Pl on,
Germany), starting May 2020.
Project background: Our group is interested in the
evolution of bacterial transfer RNAs (tRNAs). In a
recent experiment, we deleted a tRNA gene from the
bacterium Pseudomonas uorescens SBW25, resulting
in a decrease in growth rate. This was rapidly and re-
peatedly compensated during an evolution experiment,
through duplication of large chunks of the genome. Each
of the duplications contains a new, emergent copy of a
compensatory tRNA gene.
Project: The aim of this PhD project is to investigate
the fate of the large scale duplications. The student
will rstly use experimental evolution, whole genome
sequencing and tRNA-seq to track the fate of the du-
plicated regions over time. Concurrently, they will use
targeted genetic engineering and biological assays to
unravel how each of the original and duplicated tRNA
genes contribute to translation and tness in their respec-
tive genomic backgrounds. The results of this project
will contribute to a broader picture of how tRNA genes
emerge and spread through bacterial chromosomes, and
ultimately how dierent tRNA sets evolve.
The institute and area: The MPI in Pl on is a vibrant
and interesting place to work. With three departments
and around 20 research groups, it is one of the hubs of
evolutionary research in Germany. There are PhD can-didates from a wide range of countries, and the working
language is English. There are plenty of opportunities
to interact with top researchers in the eld. Student
life is aordable; many current students rent their own
apartments.
Application information: We are looking for a highly
motivated student to join our lab. The ideal candidate
would have an MSc in molecular biology, microbiology,
or related eld, plus some experience of scripting in R.
Some background in mathematics would also be useful;
we are part of the Department of Evolutionary The-
ory, and there are opportunities for collaboration with
theorists.
To apply, please send an application letter, CV, and
contact details of two referees to gallie@evolbio.mpg.de
by the 20th December 2019. Further information can
also be requested at this address.

EvolutionaryGenomics
The Tollis Lab at Northern Arizona University (NAU;
https://tollislab.org) is seeking a highly motivated and
enthusiastic PhD student to study vertebrate evolution-
ary genomics.
Research in the lab encompasses phylogenomics, com-
parative genomics, transposable element evolution, and
the evolution of cancer suppression. The basic unifying
premise of our research is to combine molecular and com-
putational methods to uncover the mechanisms underly-
ing the evolution of phenotypes and genome structure,
as well as outstanding questions in phylogenetics. The
taxonomic focus of these questions vary widely, but cur-
rent projects include: molecular evolutionary rates and
the phylogenomics of squamate reptiles; rates of transpo-
sition in rapidly evolving versus slowly evolving clades;
population genomics of elephants, bats and other verte-
brates; and dierential gene expression of DNA damage
response in various vertebrate species. The successful
Ph.D. student will have considerable exibility in craft-
ing a thesis with Dr. Tollis that incorporates all of these
topics and more.
The successful student will be admitted to the30 EvolDir December 1, 2019
Ph.D. program in Informatics with a Health and
Bioinformatics Emphasis in the School of Infor-
matics, Computing and Cyber Systems at NAU
(https://nau.edu/school-of-informatics-computing-
and-cyber-systems/phd-informatics-and-computing/).
Health and Biological data are being generated at a
rapid pace. Both data types fall into the category of big
data science that requires considerable computational
skill and infrastructure if we are to gain new insights
into human health, disease, and biodiversity. The
scientists in the Health and Bioinformatics research
group at NAU have met this challenge by incorporating
molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, health
informatics, epidemiology, statistics, and computer
science. Our expertise spans metagenomics, pathogen
detection, infectious disease, phylogenetics, comparative
genomics, population genetics, molecular evolution,
secondary data analysis, epidemiological modeling,
and cancer. We collaborate with community partners
and research institutions throughout the world as well
as here at NAU and in Flagsta, and are funded by
agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the
United States Department of Agriculture, the Depart-
ment of Defense, Arizona Game & Fish Department,
and the Arizona Department of Health Services.
A student stipend will be provided through a combina-
tion of research and teaching assistantships.
Flagsta, AZ has been rated one of the happiest cities
in America, with four seasons, year-round recreation,
terric college vibe, and a laid-back attitude. We are
close to the Phoenix metropolitan area, but even closer
to Sedona and the Grand Canyon, and are surrounded
by mountainous national forest.
Interested students should e-mail Marc Tollis
(marc.tollis@nau.edu) with the following:
1. A cover letter describing the student's educational
background, research interests and experience, interest
in the lab, and career plans with a Ph.D. 2. A curricu-
lum vitae including contact information and references.
3. A writing sample that could include a co-authored
published manuscript, preprint, undergraduate thesis.

OxfordU PlanarianEvolution
The SalGo lab, Aboobaker lab and Jackson lab at the
Department of Zoology of Oxford University invite joint
applications for a PhD in the area of life history theory,
population/community ecology, ecological modelling,
and parasitology. The project will examine the drivers
of alternative life history strategies using atworms as
model organisms. Flatworms (Platyhelminthes) are
small acoelomate organisms that lack specialised cir-
culatory or respiratory organs and have a single diges-
tive cavity opening. In the UK, where this project
will take place, atworms are typically found under
rocks in freshwater habitats. With over 25,000 known
species, atworms display a great deal of variation in
life history strategies and conservation status. Some
atworm species reproduce strictly asexually by ssion,
while others can reproduce both sexually and asexually;
some species are short-lived, while others, through their
ability to regenerate, can live extremely long lives and
potentially avoid physiological senescence altogether. In
addition, some atworms in the UK are invasive, while
others are believed to be narrow endemics.
This PhD project could take (i.e. we expect the prospec-
tive candidate to take the project in innovative direc-
tions) any mixture of experimental, theoretical and eld
work approaches to (i) examine the factors that have
contributed to the evolution of the fascinating atworm
life history traits (e.g. How did the mechanisms that
allow regenerative life histories and asexuality evolve?);
and (ii) test how these life history strategies might now
allow them to persist in a world characterised by anthro-
pogenic environmental change (How robust are atworm
life history strategies to changes in the environment?
How do multiple stressors impact the diversity of life
history strategies in atworm communities?). The stu-
dent will capitalise on the world-leading expertise in
atworm biology, regenerative biology, experimental bi-
ology, and ecological modelling at the Department of
Zoology of the University of Oxford. A range of quan-
titative methods (mathematical theory and statistics),
eld and laboratory experimental manipulations, includ-
ing mesocosms, will be applied. Plausible hypotheses
to test using a combination of approaches include the
role of abiotic (e.g. global warming, pollution, habitat
loss), and biotic stressors (e.g. predators, parasites, can-
nibalism) in the shaping of life history strategies and
demographic/community outcomes.Funding: Applicants will need to obtain funding to
cover tuition fees and living expenses. There are a wide
range of funding opportunities at Oxford, which include
two Doctoral Training Programmes (DTP): the NERC
DTP and the BBSRC DTP. Details on both are found
here (https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk and
http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/-

students' ^A eligibility for funding from these DTPs
are limited to UK/European citizens. Interested
non-UK/non-European citizens are welcome to propose
and seek alternative funding support from their home
countries.
The applicant should have at least an upper second-

GallWaspEvolution
Graduate student and postdoc opportunities to study
gall wasp (Cynipidae) evolution at Penn State.
Background: Gall wasps comprise thousands of species
that manipulate host plant development to create tumor-
like structures, called galls, in which wasp larvae feed
while being protected from predators and the outside
environment. These galls exhibit diverse architectures
and develop in specic locations on host-plant species
depending on the wasp species that initiated the gall.
While wasps are likely using molecular signals to alter
plant development to generate these novel structures,
the mechanisms are unknown. Through our NSF-funded
project (grant number 1856626), we aim to shed light
on the evolution of gall wasps and their galls using phy-
logenomic data, examine molecular mechanisms of gall
induction, and to develop new tools for research on these
wasps in North America. Multiple opportunities are
available to pursue some combination of phylogenomics,
taxonomy, informatics, genomics, transcriptomics, and
chemical ecology with project PIs.
Qualications: Interested students/postdocs should
have a passion for discovery, interest in biodiversity,
strong background in biology and molecular research,
and, given the large scale of this project, good organiza-
tion skills and attention to detail.
How to apply: This position will based in University
Park, PA in the Hines and/or Deans Labs and involve
a team of project investigators including Drs. Andrew
Deans, Heather Hines, John Tooker (all PSU), Se an

https://www.mpg.de/14073947/phdmathbio PhD posi-
tion (m/f/d) - Mathematical Biology (3 years)
The Research Group \Stochastic Evolutionary Dynam-
ics" at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, Pl on, is looking for a PhD student (m/f/d) to join
the research group. The *PhD position in Mathematical
Biology (3 years)* has the topic \Evolutionary dynamics
of antibiotic resistance on plasmids".
The evolution of antibiotic resistance poses a severe
threat to modern healthcare. Clinically relevant resis-
tance is often encoded on plasmids. Plasmids are extra-
chromosomal DNA elements that can be transmitted
vertically or be transferred horizontally between cells.
The location of resistance genes on plasmids can lead to
special evolutionary dynamics. The aim of the project
is to develop mathematical models for the evolution and
spread of resistance on plasmids. On the mathematical
side, the analysis will mainly be based on branching
process theory, complemented by deterministic ODE
systems and stochastic computer simulations.
The position is part of a DFG-funded Research Training
Group (RTG) on \Translational Evolutionary Research".
The program brings together 14 research groups from
several institutions to study how insights from evolution-
ary biology can be applied to solve problems in medicine,
food production, and wildlife conservation. Projects are
organised in tandems who work on related topics. The
tandem partner of the proposed project is Professor Tal
Dagan (University of Kiel). The student would hence
closely interact with a research group that focuses on
experimental evolution and data analysis.
The ideal student will be one who is interested in apply-
ing mathematical modeling to gain insights into biologi-
cal problems and is enthusiastic about math as well as
about biology. The successful student will learn how to
set up and analyse theoretical models to describe bio-
logical processes and become skilled in using branching
process theory as a modeling tool. Applicants should
have a background in mathematics, physics, biology,
computer science or a related eld. Good quantitative
skills are essential. Prior experience in mathematical
modeling and knowledge of a programming language (C,
C++, Java, R, Python...) is an advantage.
*Working environment*34 EvolDir December 1, 2019
The student will join a young group at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology. In our group, we
focus on exploring the role of stochasticity in evolu-
tion. In the context of resistance evolution, we closely
collaborate with experimental microbiologists at the
University of Kiel. The group is part of the Department
of Evolutionary Theory. The student will hence be part
of a larger community of researchers working at the
intersection of mathematics and biology with many op-
portunities to take part in journal clubs, reading groups
etc.
The Max Planck Institute is a lively institute with three
departments (Evolutionary Theory, Microbial Popula-
tion Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and several ad-
ditional research groups. It hosts several workshops
per year and continuously welcomes international short-
term and long-term visitors, creating a stimulating and
positive research environment. We maintain close in-
teractions with Kiel University and belong to the Kiel
Evolution Center. The area is a center of evolutionary
biology in Germany.
*Pl** o**n*
Pl on is a small town, embedded in a beautiful landscape
with innumerous lakes and close to the Baltic Sea. The
area provides ample opportunity for free-time activities

PHD STUDENTSHIP: TOOL CRAFTING IN NEW
CALEDONIAN CROWS
SUMMARY
New Caledonian crows are renowned for their ability to
manufacture complex foraging tools from plant materi-
als. For example, using an elaborate sequence of actions,
they craft hooked stick tools from branching vegetation,
and using a completely dierent technique, they cut
tapered leaf tools from the barbed edges of screw-pine
leaves. Professor Christian Rutz's research group has
been studying the behavioural ecology of New Caledo-
nian crows since 2005, focussing on a suite of seven
established study sites, including some with marked
crow populations. Building on some of the group's re-
cent advances, this PhD project will provide a detailed
investigation of the tool-manufacture behaviour of wild
crows. There is considerable exibility with regards to
specic study objectives, but the successful candidate
is likely to conduct both eld observations and aviary-
based experiments with temporarily-captive subjects,
with excellent scope for collaboration with other group
members and external project partners. This fully-
funded PhD project oers exciting opportunities for a
highly motivated student to join a dynamic research
group, to conduct topical research on the behavioural
ecology of one of the most accomplished non-human
tool users, and to receive training in state-of-the-art
eld-ornithological research methodologies.
CENTRE FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY
The Centre for Biological Diversity (CBD) at the Uni-
versity of St Andrews provides a highly interactive and
stimulating environment for doctoral students, with par-
ticular strengths in animal behaviour and evolution. The
successful candidate would benet from frequent inter-
actions with postgraduates, postdocs and PIs, including
lab chats, seminars, and discussion groups.

in New Zealand
A PhD scholarship, funded by a New Zealand Royal
Society Marsden Fund Grant, is available with Dr Anna
Santure and Dr Annabel Whibley in the School of Bio-
logical Sciences, University of Auckland, New Zealand.
This project is an exciting opportunity to use genomics
and evolutionary genetics approaches to understand
the evolution of two globally invasive species, the com-
mon myna (*Acridotheres tristis*) and common star-
ling (*Sturnus vulgaris*). There is evidence that both
species have adapted rapidly in the invasive ranges, de-
spite what we assume to be very low founding genetic
diversity. Common myna and common starling are two
of only three bird species on the global 'top 100' inva-
sive species list, and oer unique replicated systems to
identify genomic dierences between invasive and native
source populations. Changes to morphology and geneDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 39
expression will be correlated with identied genomic
changes in genes and regulatory elements to infer the
genomic basis of rapid adaptation.
We are looking for a candidate with a strong background
in genetics and bioinformatics, statistics, computer sci-
ence or similar, as well as a passion for evolutionary
biology and ecology.
The PhD position requires the applicant to be eligible
for admission to the PhD programme at the University
of Auckland (see https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/-

ExperimentalEvolutionCRISPR
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic
PhD student to work on the evolution of transcriptional

phds/project/swbio-dtp-phd-project-horizontal-
transfer-of-antiviral-defences-between-bacterial-
species/?p114158 Project Description: Horizontal
transfer of antiviral defences between bacterial species
The discovery of CRISPR-Cas has arguably been
one of the most inuential discoveries in biology of
the past decades. CRISPR-Cas systems that are
encoded on bacterial genomes protect against viral and
plasmid infections. This has been utilised to safeguardindustrial fermentations, and recently been exploited
to eradicate antimicrobial resistance plasmids from
microbial communities under laboratory conditions.
Furthermore, the recent development of CRISPR-Cas
genome editing is facilitating ground-breaking strategies
in science, agriculture, medicine and pest management.
Many of these applications require that the genes
encoding CRISPR-Cas are stably expressed across
many generations. Yet, long-term studies that examine
genetic and transcriptomic stability of these systems
are lacking. Based on classical evolutionary theory,
we hypothesise that we can predictably manipulate
the way CRISPR-Cas gene regulation evolves in
bacteria following the synthetic or natural transfer of
CRISPR-Cas genes to a na ve bacterial host. An ability
to predictably evolve CRISPR-Cas gene regulation
would be truly ground-breaking, and would have
clear implications for the use of these systems in
industry and in the development of strategies for
eradicating antimicrobial resistance. Throughout
this interdisciplinary project, the student will receive
extensive training in experimental evolution, molecular
microbiology, genetics and modelling. The student will
be based in the Taylor lab in the Milner Centre for
Evolution at the University of Bath with opportunities
to work in the Westra and Buckling labs at the ESI,

Sex role evolution and demography in shorebirds PhD
studentship based in Debrecen, Hungary 2020-2024
Supervisors: Prof Tam as Sz ekely (Debrecen University)
and Dr Vojt ~AKubelka (Debrecen Uni.)
Deadline of application: 15 December 2019
We are interested in: Sex roles (i.e. courtship, competi-
tion for mates, pair bonding and parenting) are among
the most diverse social behaviour. Recent research is
uncovering key elements of sex role variation, but signi-
cant gaps remain. Appropriate sexual behaviour is essen-
tial for reproduction, and thus understanding the causes
and implications of sex roles are at the core of evolution-
ary biology and fundamental for the study of life history
evolution, physiology and population biology. Under-
standing sex roles and demography (reproduction and
mortality rates) is also important for biodiversity conser-
vation since disruptions to normal sexual behaviour due
to environmental changes reduce the viability of wild
populations. Our team was awarded an project of Hun-
garian Science Foundation, the ~ALVONAL Shorebird
Science: https://elvonalshorebirds.com/ to investigate
sex role evolution in shorebirds.
This PhD project will focus on sex role behaviour in
shorebirds. Using behavioural observations in wild pop-
ulations it will investigate causes of display behaviour,
pair bonding and parenting. The PhD student will test
whether (i) sex role behaviours are induced by ambient
environment, demographic parameters or social environ-
ment, (ii) explore the relationship between dierent sex
role components, and (iii) test the tness implications
of sex role variations.
The ideal candidate: has a strong interest in evolu-
tionary biology, behavioural ecology and eld biology,
and willing to work in remote areas, e.g. South Africa,
South America or Arctic Russia or elsewhere. He/she
needs to have a solid background in data analyses prefer-ably in R, and statistical modelling. A condition of the

develop proof-of-principle for the use of reproductive
interference as complementary new method for insect
control. Insect pests are a persistent and growing threat
to human livelihoods and health because they damage
economically important crops and spread disease. The
pressing global challenge of combating such pests is
being exacerbated by the evolution of resistance, the
diminishing availability of pesticides and by climate
change. The student will focus on reproductive interfer-
ence ' whereby courtship and copulation of one species
/ population is interrupted or disturbed by another. In
the context of insect control this is often referred to as
^Asatyrization' and it works because the consequences
(particularly costs) of hybrid mating can lead to the com-
petitive exclusion of a harmful species (or population)
by a more benign one.

and Dr Will Nash (The Earlham Institute, UK) and Dr
Tim Harvey Samuel (The Pirbright Institute, UK).
You will train at the interface of genetic engineering and
fundamental biology to understand the role of maternal
RNAs in early development. Variation in the diversity
and levels of maternal RNAs are key to understanding
evolutionary adaptation and plasticity, as well as aid-
ing in the development of next generation gene drive
systemsfor insect control. Successful early embryonic de-
velopment occurs as a result of a precise balance between
the eects of both embryonic and maternal genomes.
Very little of this process is known in key insect pests
and it is of particular importance for eectively tackling
serious agricultural pests such as the medy (Ceratitis
capitita). This is an extreme generalist whose larvae can
thrive in over 350 dierent host fruits, many of which
are of global economic importance.

UEdinburgh ParasiteEvolution
A studentship on The evolutionary ecology of dis-

change parasite life histories? is available in the Reece
Lab, University of Edinburgh, UK.
More details can be found here, including eligibility
criteria and how to apply [deadline 10th Jan 2020]:
https://www.ndaphd.com/phds/project/the-
evolutionary-ecology-of-disease-transmission-how-
will-vector-control-programmes-change-parasite-life-
histories/?p114770 The Reece lab uncovers the
strategies parasites have evolved to cope with the
challenges of their lifestyle and to exploit the oppor-
tunities it brings, by asking what makes a successful
parasite and what are the evolutionary limits to their
success?. Specically, we investigate how parasites
maximise \survival" and \reproduction". These tness
components underpin the severity and transmission of
diseases.
Most disease research focuses on interactions between
parasites and their hosts. Analogous studies of interac-
tions between parasites and vectors have been largely
neglected, despite the fact that vectors are responsible
for spreading disease. Clearly, to fully understand the
evolution of vector-born parasites it is necessary to ask
how they solve the challenges of living in hosts and in vec-
tors. This is especially important for malaria parasites
whose vectors are changing in response to vector-control
programs (e.g., bed nets, insecticides). Whilst the evo-
lutionary responses of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes
to vector-control are being monitored, the knock-on con-
sequences for parasite evolution have been overlooked.
Just like drugs or vaccines administered to hosts, vector-
control represents an ecological perturbation aimed at
reducing parasite tness. History clearly illustrates that44 EvolDir December 1, 2019
attempts to reduce the survival and/or transmission of
malaria parasites is usually met with counter-evolution
(e.g., drug resistance mutations and phenotypic toler-
ance). Parasite counter evolution to vector-control may
be constrained or facilitated, depending on the amount
of genetic variation and plasticity underpinning parasite
phenotypes. Anticipating parasite evolution will inform
monitoring strategies for current control programs as
well as uncovering novel new vector-control strategies.

PlantPopulationGenetics
PhD Position available, supervised by Matthew Hart-
eld (University of Edinburgh) and Mario Vallejo-Marin
(University of Stirling). Title: Dissecting the causes of
reproductive mode variation in the yellow monkeyower
(Mimulus guttatus).
Project Description: Perennial plants exhibit a wide
variety of reproductive modes, from exclusively sexual
reproduction through seeds, to relying almost entirely on
asexual propagation. Various theories exist to explain
the evolutionary and ecological advantages of these re-
productive modes, but testing theories can be hampered
by a lack of empirical data. The facultative sexual plant
Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyower) is an exciting
model system for investigating the evolution of dier-
ent reproductive modes, as there is a large amount of
variation in the relative contribution of sexual and asex-
ual reproduction, with populations spanning dierent
environments and ecological niches. By investigating
genetic diversity across populations and linking it to
the local reproductive mode across environments, wecan ask: are dierent modes (sex or asex) associated
with specic ecogeographic regions? To what extent is
the reproductive mode aected by local ecological con-
ditions, compared to large environmental factors such
as climate? How does reproductive mode (sex, asex)
and mating'Vsystem (selng, outcrossing) interact?
The PhD project will use UK populations of Mimulus
guttatus as a model system for investigating the evolu-
tion of reproductive modes, and how they interact with
the mechanisms of natural selection. The student will
generate new genomic data from previously'Vcollected
samples to quantify the extent of self-fertilisation and
clonal reproduction in natural populations. These data
will allow us to investigate how the evolutionary history
diers between regions exhibiting dierent reproductive
modes. The project will put the student at the fore-
front of developing an exciting new model system for
evolutionary genetics study.
The expected start date is October 2020.

Project Description:|Round Island, Mauritius, hosts a
community of rare endemic lizard species. Their envi-
ronment was cleared of most vegetation by introduced
goats and rabbits (now eliminated). A partnership
between the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mau-
ritian Wildlife Foundation and the Government's Na-
tional Parks and Conservation Service has permitted
the restoration of habitat and with it the recovery of
the reptile-dominated vertebrate community (Cole et
al. 2018). The reptile species occupy a landscape going
through plant community recovery, but little is known
about availability of the invertebrate prey. The skinks
and geckos have proved to be remarkably resilient to
environmental change, although some species were extir-
pated from the island's reptile community. It is likely the
reptiles originally adapted to dierent niches, including
trophic niches that allowed them to avoid direct compe-
tition. One species, the Telfair's skink, is a generalist,
consuming a wide range of dierent taxonomic groups
(Brown et al. 2014). Other species may have narrower
niche axes and be more specialised. Understanding
the feeding niche of the reptiles may help explain dif-
ferences in population recovery and guide restoration
management to enhance the success of planned reptile
reintroductions.
The main aims/methods of this project are: - To anal-
yse the diets of the lizard species that have survived on
Round Island. Collect lizard faecal samples from across
the island and use High Throughput Sequencing (HTS)
of plant and invertebrate DNA.- To DNA barcode as
many invertebrate species on Round Island as possible
(we have already barcoded all the plants). Invertebrates
will be identied by the student at the Natural HistoryMuseum. Once we have the barcodes we can interpret
the output from HTS and identify who is eating what.-
To analyse for prey choice and competition. Compare
what lizards are eating with available food (Vaughan et
al. 2018) and use dietary overlap tests to assess dietary
similarity.- To analyse dierences in the abundances of
lizard and invertebrate species in dierent plant com-
munities. Apply/develop a range of invertebrate and
reptile survey techniques. Look for areas of more ad-
vanced regrowth of the vegetation to predict changes to
the island food web structure in the future (Macfadeyn
et al. 2011).- To analyse the diets of reptile species
that are to be reintroduced to Round Island's reptile
community. Use prey overlap tests to evaluate whether
any of these species are likely to compete with Round
Island species.
The project will be co-supervised by Dr Nik Cole (CASE
Partner) from Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and
the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, and by Dr Gavin
Broad (DTP Partner) of the Natural History Museum.
Their expertise was critical to the development of this
project and will be invaluable to the student.
Applicants will need to have a strong academic record
with expertise relevant to this project. Molecular Ecol-
ogy expertise would be ideal but is not a prerequisite.
Must be able to work in the eld on a rugged tropical
island for extended periods and also be good in the
lab. Possession of a clean driving licence would be an
advantage for accessing mainland sites on Mauritius.

* Project Background * While it is well known that
mothers transfer 'V next to their genes 'V various non-
genetic factors to their young (e.g., hormones, DNA
methylation variants and small RNAs), fathers in most
animals are thought to transfer nothing but genes to
ospring. However, this view is now increasingly un-
tenable given recent studies which show that fathers
inuence ospring phenotypes via DNA methylation or
small RNAs. A clear example of such paternal inuences
occurs in the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus (e.g., https:/-
/doi.org/10.1002/evl3.124), in which fathers transfer a
spermatophore (a large clump of foam) to females dur-
ing mating which aects ospring viability. The aim of
this project is to understand how maternal and paternal
eects interact: for example, do paternal eects enhance
maternal eects and vice versa, or do they inhibit each
other? How do paternal eects respond to selection
versus maternal eects?
* Potential projects * Below we suggest three possi-
ble components. Students are welcome to design the
contents of this PhD project according to their own
interests.
Computational models of paternal eects: as we still
have a limited understanding of whether paternal eects
are a general phenomenon in the animal kingdom, this
part of the project allows the student to learn compu-
tational techniques with which to model the evolutionof paternal eects across a range of biological scenar-
ios. Such models allow you to make general predictions
about the ecological contexts and molecular mechanisms
that are most conducive to paternal eects.
Selection experiments of paternal versus maternal ef-
fects and their interaction: with these computational
predictions in hand, we then create selection lines of
Teleogryllus oceanicus to assess how maternal and pater-
nal eects interact. We can do so by articially selecting
for diverging spermatophore characteristics, so that lines
become dierent in features such as spermatophore size
and transcriptome prole. Using other lines, we can
also articially select for dierent characteristics of ova.
Ultimately, by crossing spermatophore and ova selection
lines, we can then achieve much-needed insight on how
maternal and paternal eects interact in shaping the
transcriptome and subsequent survival of the developing
zygote.
Transcriptome bioinformatics: using state-of-the-art
bioinformatics techniques we analyze the gene expres-
sion levels in spermatophores and ova of these selection
lines to assess divergence in paternal versus maternal
eects.
* Start Date * October 2020.
* Funding * This is a project funded by the South
West Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership (SWBio
DTP). The selection process can be found here: https://-
www.swbio.ac.uk/programme/selection-process/ Fund-
ing is available to UK and EU nationals who have estab-
lished UK residency (EU nationals must have ordinarily
lived in the UK throughout the three years preceding
the start of the studentship).
Applicants from EU countries who do not meet
the residency requirements may still be eligible
for a tuition-fees-only award. However, a limited
number of fully-funded four year studentships avail-

climate/ Deadline: 6 Jan 2020 Eligibility: UK and
EU students only Funding: UK (NERC, Competition-
funded)
Ecosystem stability and global food security depend
upon healthy populations of bees, our foremost pollina-
tors. Bees provide pollination services worth hundreds
of billions of pounds annually. Honeybees and bumble-
bees are our most important managed pollinators, but
the UK is home to ~245 species of wild solitary bees
which collectively perform most pollination.
Unfortunately, bee populations are declining, with mul-
tiple causes. Key to bee survival and tness is nutrition;
all bees feed ospring with pollen gathered from the
landscape. But human inuences such as agricultural
intensication are altering nutritional landscapes for
bees [3,4], and fundamentally aecting gene expression,
growth and reproduction. Most of what we know about
bee nutrition comes from studies in social bees like hon-
eybees or bumblebees [5,6], where nutrition inuences
caste determination, development, pathogen resistance
and others. However, the nutritional ecology of other
bees, particularly solitary bees, is largely unstudied. Un-
less these bees can detect and respond to changes in
nutritional landscapes, their tness will be reduced 'V
a scenario we term a \nutritional trap".
Human activity is also changing climates and raising
average temperatures. Temperature aects animals' ^A
metabolic rate, physiology, digestion, and nutrient as-
similation, as well as gene expression. Dr Gilbert' ^As
recent work [7] has identied the need to store enough
carbohydrate and fat to survive the winter as potentially
critical for solitary bees' ^A nutritional ecology. But we
know little about how this is regulated, how climate
change will aect bees, and how bees will deal with
changing nutritional landscapes in a future lled with
uncertainty.
We are now, for the rst time, in a position to under-
stand not just whether but also how dierent nutri-
tional landscapes and climates aect bees. This exciting
cross-institutional project combines eld ecology with
cutting edge molecular approaches to address a cru-December 1, 2019 EvolDir 49
cial knowledge gap about how bees are being aected
by human-altered nutritional landscapes. This project
addresses issues relevant for pure ecological science, con-
servation biology, agriculture and crop science. At Hull,
Dr Gilbert' ^As lab has pioneered rearing protocols for
the economically and ecologically important solitary
bee, Osmia bicornis. This work is providing an unprece-
dented window onto bee nutritional ecology. At Leeds,
Dr Duncan' ^As lab uses a variety of cutting-edge molec-
ular tools to understand how bees are inuenced by
their environment. Dr Duncan has conducted ground-
breaking work on how nutrition aects gene expression
in developing bees, as well as recent work on the en-
vironmental and molecular control of reproduction in
O. bicornis. The student will capitalise on this timely
opportunity to synthesize the research interests of these
two research groups and create collaborative links be-
tween institutions. The candidate will be integrated into
both lab groups and will benet from the infrastructure
and connections at both universities.
Dierences in larval nutrition in the honeybee results
in gene expression changes and ultimately adult bees
with dierent reproductive potential and lifespan. Using
careful manipulations within controlled laboratory en-
vironments, the student will rst establish how dietary
macronutrients aect the tness of solitary bee larvae
in response to changes in rearing temperature. Then,
they will use high-throughput sequencing technology
to examine genome-wide expression proles of larvae
receiving dierent diet and temperature treatments, to
understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms
underlying bees' ^A responses to landscape and climate
change. Nutritional cues are known to alter gene ex-
pression [8], but to date studies have focussed largely
on a few genes, and only in honeybees. The student
will compare larvae receiving dierent treatments in
(1) choices larvae make about which nutrients to con-
sume, (2) correlates of tness such as body size and
overwinter survival, and (3) expression of growth- ver-
sus diapause-related genes. Outcomes: The ndings
will, rstly, shed light on the optimal nutrition for bees
'V both currently, and in a warmer future. They will
help inform active measures such as wildower strips
to conserve and promote these vital pollinators as the
climate changes. Secondly, results will also show the
physiological eects of dierent nutritional landscapes
upon bees, now

EvolutionSalamanders
The Lee-Yaw lab at the University of Lethbridge in Al-
berta Canada is looking to recruit 1-2 graduate students
to work on the evolutionary ecology of range limits.
Current, priority projects in the lab are focused on the
long-toed salamander and include:
1) Wildre eects on genetic diversity and population
connectivity
The frequency and severity of wildres are increasing
around the world, making it imperative to understand
the eects of these events on wildlife populations and
species of conservation concern in particular. In col-
laboration with Parks Canada, the Lee-Yaw lab is in-
vestigating the eects of the 2017 Kenow Wildre on
long-toed salamanders in Waterton Lakes National Park.
Long-toed salamanders occur at the edge of their range
in Alberta where they are considered a species of Special
Concern. The Kenow Wildre was a severe disturbance
event aecting 40% of vegetated areas in the park in-
cluding many of the breeding ponds used by this species.
Taking advantage of pre- and post-re samples from
across the park, we will assess changes in genetic di-
versity and patterns of gene ow in response to the
re. This work includes opportunities for eldwork in
the stunning setting of Waterton Lakes National Park
and surrounding areas of the Rocky Mountains. The
project will involve molecular lab work and modelling
landscape connectivity with GIS data. This project is
best-suited for an MSc student, although could be ex-
tended to a PhD. Applicants should have a background
or coursework in evolution, population biology, and/or
ecology. Molecular lab experience is a strong assets, as
is eld experience, familiarity with R, and/or experience
working with GIS datasets.
For more information on this project, visit: https://-
julleeyaw.weebly.com/wildre-project.html 2) Genomic
perspectives on range limits
I am seeking a motivated PhD student to collect and
analyze genomic data (ddRADseq and/or transcriptome
data) for the long-toed salamander. This species is
found throughout the Pacic Northwest and is com-
prised of several, genetically distinct subspecies. The
boundaries between subspecies aord an opportunity
to study parapatric range limits involving hybridization50 EvolDir December 1, 2019
while the species' eastern range limits in the foothills
of the Rocky Mountains represent an opportunity to
study limits to adaptation and range limits along eleva-
tional gradients. Tissue samples from across the species'
range are available. A number of dissertation projects
involving these samples are possible, including testing
genetic explanations for range limits, examining hybrid
zone dynamics and cytonuclear interactions, and testing
biogeographic hypotheses of historical range dynamics.
Prior experience in the molecular lab is essential and
priority will be given to candidates who have experience
with next-generation sequencing (library preparation
and SNP calling). Protocol optimization and bioinfor-
matics will be done in collaboration with other labs and
may involve opportunities to travel. There is scope to
pair the genomic data with other types of data (eld or
lab experiments, or GIS modelling) depending on the
student's interests and progress.
Other projects within the scope of my research program
may be considered depending on funding.
General inquiries should be sent to Julie Lee-Yaw
(julie.leeyaw@uleth.ca). Applications should be sent
by December 20. Please use the subject line \Graduate
Studies" and include 1) a brief statement of research
interests, 2) relevant experience, 3) a current CV, 4) un-
ocial copies of academic transcripts, and 5) intended
start data and whether you are seeking a MSc or PhD.
U of L deadlines for applying to graduate school are
February 1 (for a May start date) and May 1 (for fall
start). All students are encouraged to apply for exter-
nal funding. Please note that I am currently unable to
provide stipend support for international tuition fees:
I would be happy to consider students from outside of
Canada who have their own funding or who are eligible
for U of L graduate awards.

and welcomes applications from students with diverse
backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.

Project summary Will populations be able to cope with
the rapid climate changes? This question is critical
and timely given the increasing pace of human induced
changes. This is particularly true for crop wild rela-
tives which in addition to climate changes may often
be threatened by crop-to-wild gene ow following the
domestication of their cultivated relative. Fruit trees
have major economic and ecological roles, yet the study
of their response to climate change has been surpris-
ingly neglected. The project will therefore assess the
capacities of the two major wild apple contributors to
the cultivated apple genome using an unprecedented
multi-layer approach (genomic, gene expression, eco-
physiology) applied to a transplant experiment in con-
trolled conditions. The project will bring new insight in
how fruit tree species respond to climate changes in a
context of domestication. This is not only an academic
exercise as wild fruit tree crop relatives render multiple
ecosystem services and are often emblematic species
in their respective ecosystems. They have also a high
potential genetic diversity for improvement of future
breeding programs in context of climate changes.
Master project The candidate will be involved in the
assessment of the adaptive and plastic capacities at the
ecological level of the two major crop wild apple rela-
tives. The project involves the transplant of wild apple
seedlings from these two species in four dierent climate
conditions simulated in a national controlled climate
simulator experimental station (ECOTRON). 1) TheDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 55
candidate will lead the launching of the experiment in
two out of the four climatic conditions (i.e. ECON-
TRON celles) during spring 2020 by transplanting crop
wild apple seedlings originating from Eurasia and will
measure several phenotypic traits. The germination
date and growth rate of each plant will be measured
three times a week. Various functional traits which are
proxies of the condition of the plant (i.e. chlorophyll
content, carbon/nitrogen balance, and avonol and an-
thocyanin content measured with the Dualex?? pincel)
will be measured once a week the last two weeks of the
experiment. 2) He/She will analyze an already available
dataset that was generated during summer 2019 for the
two other conditions.
Methodology : Statistical analyses (linear and mixed
models, R), ecophysiology, phenotypic measurement
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-
date will have skills in ecology and evolution or at least
will show strong interest in these elds. He/she will not
necessarily be familiar with apple model.

Background: Many pollinator species, recognised as
essential for ecosystem function, are undergoing rapid
declines. One recent exception is the 'Tree Bumblebee'
Bombus hypnorum: expanding its range into and across
the UK in <20 years, it is now one of our most common
species.
Building on previous work from the supervisory team,
and in collaboration with the Earlham Institute, this
project will investigate key genomic dierences between
this and other bumblebee (Bombus) species to substan-
tially improve our understanding of the factors con-
tributing to its success, along with the declines of others.
The project's focus is a genomic comparison of Bombus
species from within the UK and continental Europe.
Initial work has identied genomic regions of interest
in B. hypnorum that may be indicative of its ability to
adapt to anthropogenically altered landscapes. How-
ever, current data are preliminary and lack essential
phylogenetic comparison.
Methodology: This is a timely and exciting opportu-
nity to generate a highly novel, and substantial, genomic
dataset to test hypotheses as to whether the observed ge-
nomic dierences are unique to B. hypnorum, or shared
among Bombus species (some evidence suggests ele-
vated resilience in the wider Pyrobombus sub-genus).
In addition to fullling the specic aims, the data gener-56 EvolDir December 1, 2019
ated will oer the student signicant scope to guide the
project's further direction through characterisation of
genomic signatures and dierences across this important
pollinator group.
Training The project will equip the successful student
with state-of-the-art genomic techniques as well as bioin-
formatic and modelling skills that are highly transferable
and increasingly essential across a wide range of aca-
demic and applied biological disciplines. The student
will also gain important soft skills (e.g. communica-
tion, team working, problem solving). He/she will be
based in Plymouth, spending short periods at the other
Institutions as relevant.
Person Specication The successful candidate will have
a biology-based degree, an academic interest in evolu-
tionary ecology, and be enthusiastic about pursuing a
laboratory- and computer-based project. Ideally, he/she
will have some basic molecular ecology experience (e.g.
DNA extraction, PCR) and interest in genetic and evo-
lutionary analysis. Experience of genome sequencing
and bioinformatics is not essential as full training will
be provided.

A PhD opportunity in population genetic and den-
drochronology: Understanding adaptation of sugar
maple at its northern distribution limit Context: The
sugar maple is a dominant species of the Eastern North-
American temperate forest, which is expected to migrate
northward as a result of global warming. Populations
at the edge of their range should be therefore the rst
to benet from climate change. Genetic makeup of fron-
tier populations, however, may aect species capacity
to adapt to changing environment. Specically, it is
hypothesized that a low genetic diversity of such pop-
ulations may limit ability of the species to respond to
increases in the length and average temperature of the
growing season.
The doctoral project will seek to assess the role of genetic
makeup in the future dynamics of maple distribution
range and will study regeneration and growth of frontiermaple populations in Eastern Canada. For the study
of maple regeneration the project will examine the vari-
ability in genetic diversity across dierent age cohorts
within populations. For the study of tree growth, the
project will rely on the analysis of growth response to
climatic changes, as recorded in the tree rings, and as-
sessments of genetic variability within frontier maple
populations.
PhD student. We are looking for an ambitious and
highly motivated PhD student with a completed master
degree in forest ecology, population genetics/genomics,
climatology, geography, or ecosystem modelling. Doc-
umented experiences with dendrochronology, forest ge-
netics, and large relational databases are strong assets
during the evaluation process. The knowledge of R is
a must. The candidate should be uent in English and
has a good ability to formulate himself/herself both
orally and in writing. Knowledge of French and Chinese
is a strong asset. A record of scientic publications is
highly valued. We put a great emphasis on personal
characteristics of the successful applicant, solid work
ethics, and in particular the ability to independently
manage a large volume of laboratory and analytical
tasks and to meet reporting and publication deadlines.
The candidate is expected to be physically t and capa-
ble of conducting eld work in remote yet aesthetically
superior environments. It is expected that the student
will spend between six to twelve months with a project
partner, South China Botanical Garden of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences in Guangdong.
Location. The student will be based at the Forest Re-
search Institute of the University of Quebec at Abitibi-
Temiscamingue (IRF UQAT, Rouyn-Noranda QC). The
student will become a member of the Chair in Sus-
tainable Forest Management and the Center for Forest
Studies. The IRF team enjoys a highly dynamic and
truly international research environment. The city of
Rouyn-Noranda is very active culturally and oers a
high quality of life thanks to its tourist attractions (Film
Festival, Music Festival Emerging, World Guitar Festival
to name a few) and a large number of outdoor activities
which include hiking, camping, canoeing, skiing, and
snowshoeing (http://www.ville.rouyn-noranda.qc.ca/;

Evolutionary quantitative genetics in the wild: be-
haviour, growth and tness in Soay sheep
Project Description
Contemporary natural selection frequently appears to
favour the evolution of increased body size. However,
corresponding evolutionary responses of body size, of
magnitudes predicted by evolutionary quantitative ge-
netic theory, are frequently not observed. The nature
of evolutionary constraints in the evolution of many
traits, particularly body size, thus present an important
problem at the conuence of current evolutionary the-
ory and data from wild populations. This PhD project
will use cutting edge technology (3D accelerometers) to
collect types of behavioural data that are not generally
available in evolutionary quantitative genetic studies, to
test hypotheses about behavioural trade-os that could
underly evolutionary stasis in body size.
The Soay sheep of St Kilda, in the Outer Hebrides,
Scotland, provide an excellent system for evolutionary
quantitative genetic studies of wild populations. The
population has been subject to an intensive individual-
based study for approximately 35 years, during which
time extensive phenotype, tness, and pedigree data
have been collected. These basic data have supported
an extremely productive research program in the evolu-
tionary quantitative genetics of wild populations. The
current PhD project will use accelerometery data log-
gers to collect detailed behavioural data. This will allow
for tests for trade-os among dierent behaviours (e.g.,58 EvolDir December 1, 2019
feeding, resting, moving, agonistic interactions) that
could underly variation in body size and constrain its
evolution.
The PhD will oer experience in eld work in a re-
mote location, the use of novel technologies for data
logging, experience with modern statistics, and a chance
to engage with current formal evolutionary theory. The
School of Biology at the University of St Andrews is
home to a large group of graduate students engaged in a
wide variety of research projects. The school provides a
highly supportive environment, and structured support
throughout the course of PhD study.

* PhD position available to study plant plasticity and lo-
cal adaptation to new pollinators after range expansion
at the University of Sussex, UK *
Supervisor: Maria Clara Castellanos (http://-
www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/plant-evolutionary-ecology-lab)
I am looking for an enthusiastic student interested in
plant-pollinator interactions and evolutionary biology.
The PhD project will focus on how plants can rapidly
adapt to new pollinator environments. Our work with
a developing study system in recently colonised envi-
ronments (Digitalis purpurea, the common foxglove)
shows that oral morphology can change in a few gener-
ations under new pollinators (including larger bees and
hummingbirds in tropical mountains) but we still know
relatively little about how this occurs. The project
will use this exciting model system to examine how
adaptation to new pollination environments takes place,
and in particular, the potential role of phenotypic plas-
ticity in the process. We will use a combination of
approaches that include: 1) experimentally testing for
local adaptation using translocation experiments in the
eld, 2) measuring plastic variation in oral traits in the
greenhouse using quantitative genetics, 3) measuring
pollinator-mediated selection on oral traits, including
male components of tness using novel techniques to
track pollen grains. There will be scope for developing
further new ideas within this system.
This 3.5-years fully funded studentship is open to UK
and EU citizens. The project will have a signicant
eld component in the UK and abroad (e.g. South and
Central America), so it is essential that applicants are
committed and available to spend time in the eld. For
eldwork in the UK and abroad, a driving licence and
driving experience are essential. Experience with plant
growing and some knowledge of Spanish are a plus.

UtahStateU EvolutionaryGenomics
The Gompert lab in the Department of Biology at Utah
State University (USU) is seeking a highly motivated
and enthusiastic PhD student to study the ecological
causes and evolutionary genetic consequences of uctu-
ating selection and contemporary evolution. Research in
the lab addresses fundamental questions in evolutionary
genetics. We are particularly interested in the genetic
architecture of ecologically important traits, the deter-
minants of genetic variation and molecular evolution
in natural populations, and the nature and evolution
of species boundaries and barriers to gene ow. This
specic position is funded through a NSF CAREER
award to Gompert. A stipend will be provided via a
mixture of teaching and research assistantships. Review
of applicants will begin November 25, 2019. The start
date for the PhD project is fall 2020.
In the struggle for existence, organisms interact with
each other and with their environment. Variation in
climate, weather, and species interactions can cause vari-
ation in the direction and strength of natural selection.
Dierences in selection across space cause local adapta-
tion. However, whether seasonal, yearly or longer-term
uctuations in selection are equally important for evo-
lution is unknown. Selection that varies over time can
cause rapid evolution. It can also erode or maintain
variation for individual traits or genes, but may or may
not be an important factor in evolutionary dynamics
more broadly. In this NSF-funded project, the Gom-
pert lab will use computer simulations, experiments,
and genome sequencing of populations sampled across
multiple generations to ll this knowledge gap.
We are looking for a PhD student interested in col-
laborating on the project. The PhD student will de-
velop computational methods to quantify the prevalence,
causes and targets of uctuating selection from popula-
tion genomic time-series data. Additional components
of the PhD student's dissertation will be tailored to the
student's interests and background. Possible project in-
clude: (i) developing theory on the consequences of uc-
tuating selection, (ii) studying the evolutionary genomic
consequences of uctuating selection in quasi-natural
selection lab experiments (with cowpea seed beetles), or
(iii) identifying the causes and consequences of uctuat-ing selection (or contemporary evolution) using popu-
lation genomic time-series from natural populations of
Lycaeides butteries.
The successful candidate should have previous training
in evolutionary biology, population genetics, applied
math and statistics, or computational biology. Some
prociency with R (or other language, e.g., C) or experi-
ence working with population genomic data is preferable,
but not essential. Students with or without a Master's
degree are encouraged to apply. We welcome and encour-
age enthusiastic and open-minded applicants from any
nation, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or socioeco-
nomic class. For more information about the Gompert

DrosophilaAdaptation
University of Wisconsin-Madison MS and PhD posi-
tions on molecular adaptation of invasive spotted wing
Drosophila
Position Description: MS and/or PhD research
assistantships are available in the Molecu-
lar Ecology Lab at UW Madison (https://-
molecularecology.russell.wisc.edu/) to assess howinvasive fruities adapt to novel environments. Insect
pests can be viewed as model systems in which
to explore fundamental concepts in ecology and
evolutionary biology. They are especially promising
candidates to study mechanisms of rapid evolution
at the genetic level, as many insect pests have shown
a remarkable ability to cope with pesticides, novel
climatic space, and novel host plants. While there
are signicant challenges in determining adaptation
at the genetic level and in nding ways to forecast
future changes, there are strong incentives (ecological,
economic and social) to do this research. Students will
combine population genomics approaches with eld
ecology and manipulative experiments to understand
the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation. Training
will focus on the use of population genomics and
physiological approaches to relate spatial and temporal
variation in the environment to adaptive genetic
variation. The start date for the project is September
2020.

UZurich PlantAdaptation
PhD position in plant adaptation
A PhD position is available in my group at the Depart-
ment of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Univer-
sity of Z urich, for a period of four years. The position
is to study the evolutionary consequences of interac-
tions between plants and insects. Most studies on plant
evolution use either an ecological approach to study
mechanisms leading to future evolutionary change, or
study patterns of past evolution using phylogenetic ap-
proaches. In this project, we will conduct experimental
evolution using fast cycling Brassica plants to investi-
gate real-time adaptation in plants. This approach has
been proven highly successful in past experiments, and
enables to study in detail the process of ongoing evolu-
tion. As selective, variable biotic environment, dierent
communities of pollinators and herbivores will be used.
During 5 generations, groups of plants will be under
selection by these insects, and their adaptive evolution
will be studied. Afterwards, selection treatments will be
swapped to study the potential of plants to reverse their
evolutionary trajectory, as required during adaptation
in dynamic environments. Plant traits under adaptive
evolution will be studied using selection analysis, phe-
notyping, as well as molecular and bioinformatics tools.
The work will be primarily based in the greenhouse and
lab. You should have a Master (or comparable) degree in
any eld of biology and a thorough interest in evolution-
ary biology. Prior experience with plants and/or insects
is an advantage. Prociency in English both orally and
written is a must. The successful candidate will work
in an exciting research environment focusing on pat-
terns and process of plant evolution. Our department
is located in the botanical gardens and houses modern
molecular and ecological labs, including greenhouses and
climate chambers for plant cultivation. The University
of Z urich has a very broad coverage of organismal andmolecular biology, and several research groups work on
evolutionary topics (www.lifescience-zurich.ch). The
city also oers excellent quality of life through cultural
programs and infrastructure, as well as an attractive
surrounding.
If you are interested in the job, please send me by e-
mail (orian.schiestl@systbot.uzh.ch) a letter describing
your motivation, C.V., copy of degrees, publications
(manuscripts), and e-mail addresses of two academic

RESEARCH PROJECT: Plant symbiosis with nitrogen-
xing cyanobacteria is a unique form of mutualistic
association. It has independently evolved in diverse, yet
isolated lineages, from a few species of bryophytes, ferns,
cycads, to a small genus of owering plants. Compared
to rhizobia, cyanobacteria are less dependent on the
host, and therefore hold a promising translational po-
tential toward installing nitrogen-xing symbiosis onto
crop plants. However, very little is known about the ge-
netic regulation in plant-cyanobacteria symbiosis. The
major diculty to study such symbiosis had been the
lack of tractable genetic systems for the host plant
species. Because of this, most of the research has solely
focused on the model cyanobiont Nostoc punctiforme,
and how the plant partners initiate and maintain sym-
biosis still remains largely unknown. The recent ground-
work by PI and project partners on hornworts, a group
of bryophytes capable of cyanobacteria symbiosis, has
made hornworts a promising model system. The com-
plete genome of the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis is
sequenced and annotated. More importantly, protocols
for genetic transformation as well as targeted gene knock-
out have been developed. By leveraging the tractableDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 63
systems established for both host (A. agrestis) and sym-
biont (N. punctiforme), this proposed research will take
the rst step to uncover the genetic underpinnings of
plant-cyanobacteria symbiosis. This project has two
specic objectives, aiming to identify the metabolites
and the genes that are essential for symbiosis. The rst
objective focuses on the putative chemical signals ex-
changed during symbiosis initiation - the hormogonium
inducing factor from the plant. The exact identities
of this signal have been unknown, but will be deter-
mined using comparative metabolomics, structural anal-
yses combined with a large-scale forward genetic screen.
The second objective is to dissect the genetic control
of symbiotic association through time course RNA-seq
experiments. A systems approach will be taken to dis-
cover and prioritize candidate genes from both partners,
and their functional involvements validated by reverse
genetics. By integrating metabolomics, gene network
analyses and genetic manipulations, this research will
provide the rst mechanistic overview on the interac-
tion between hornworts and cyanobacteria, from the
early communications to the symbiotic maintenance.
The outcome will greatly complement what is known
about plant interactions with rhizobia and AM fungi,
and address whether the common symbiosis pathway
also extends to cyanobacteria symbiosis. In addition,
given the multiple origins of cyanobacteria symbiosis
in plant tree of life, future work can build upon this
hornwort study to examine other plant lineages, thereby
testing if there is a unied molecular mechanism be-
hind plant-cyanobacteria symbiosis. Furthermore, the
essential genes and metabolites identied through this
research will lay the foundation for future eorts to
assess and design crop-cyanobacteria symbiosis.
This project is founded by a Swiss National Science
Foundation (SNSF) grant to Peter Szovenyi. The Dept.
of Systematic Botany hosts research groups working
on the evolutionary and ecological drivers of biodiver-
sity, on the macroevolution of plants, on plant-insect
interactions/pollination, on the evolution of mating sys-
tems, hybridization and speciation. The Dept. of Plant
and Microbial Biology hosts many groups working on
plant molecular and developmental biology, epigenetics,
community genomics and plant adaptation. Both in-
stitutes are housed in the beautiful Botanical Gardens
and host a diverse community of researchers in plant
biology. Ideal candidates will have an MSc in biology
with a specialization in evolution, developmental ge-
netics and/or bioinformatics. This position primarily
involves metabolomic, reverse genetic and bioinformatic
work and requires advanced skills in handling, analyzing
and interpreting high-throughput metabolomic, next-
generation sequencing and RNA-seq data. Good skillsin assembling vectors, carrying out genetic transforma-
tions and microscopy are also required. In case not
all these skills are covered, the willingness to quickly
acquire them is absolutely necessary. The student will
closely work together with the second PhD student on
this grant. Students should be willing to work both
in the wet lab and in the oce doing computational
work. The position is initially for four years. Selected
candidates will be enrolled in one of the two aliated
PHD schools in evolution or plant sciences. CLOSING
DATE: The position is opened until lled, but all ap-
plication material including CV, a summary of research
experience, a letter of motivation, copies of relevant
publications (published or submitted)

CovertVirusInfectionsInInsects
PhD position: Hide and Seek: The transmission, mech-
anism and impact of covert virus infections in insects
We are recruiting a motivated PhD student to join the
Laboratory of Virology, Wageningen University, the
Netherlands, supervised by Dr. Vera Ros.
The project focuses on covert virus infections in insects:
latent/persistent infections that do not cause any visible
signs of disease. Insects are increasingly mass reared in
large scale facilities due to a growing demand for insects
for food and feed, biological pest control, pollination and
waste management. This intensication leads to a rise
in disease outbreaks that frequently result in a complete
collapse of production systems. These outbreaks are
caused by insect-specic pathogens, including viruses,
that may already be present in a covert state within the
reared insects. Such covert virus infections can suddenly
develop into overt (symptomatic) infections under stress
conditions. Within this project we aim to elucidate the
(molecular) mechanisms underlying transmission and
maintenance of covert virus infections in insects and to
determine the impact of covert infections on host tness
and immunity. The project involves 2 PhD students,and the PhD student we are now recruiting for will
mainly focus on the role of the host immune system,
including RNA interference pathways, in maintaining
the covert state. Furthermore, he/she will use molec-
ular tools to verify identied mechanisms. As model
system, baculoviruses infecting caterpillars will be used.
The pathology of covert baculovirus infections has been
intensively studied in larval stages, however, the eect
of covert baculovirus infections and how these viruses
are passed on throughout the host life cycle has received
little attention.
The prospective PhD student will be part of a research
team and will collaborate with other PhD students and
postdocs on this project and related projects.

(80% online). (4) Mammalogy Collection; with 9,000
specimens (95% online). These research collections are
complemented by teaching collections located in the
same facility. They are now also being complemented
by annual additions of 20,000 vertebrate specimens,
samples, and DNA extractions being received and acces-

EvolutionayGenomics
The Faculty of Biology of Johannes Gutenberg Uni-
versity Mainz invites applications for the position of a
Junior Professor for Evolutionary Genomics
(Bes.Gr. W 1 LBesG with tenure track leading to a W
2)
available at the Institute of Organismic and Molecular
Evolution (iomE) at the earliest opportunity.
We are seeking an ambitious early-career scientist in the
eld of evolutionary genomics.
The research focus should be in the area of popula-
tion genomics or the molecular basis of evolutionary
adaptations (in elds such as coevolution in biotic inter-
actions, phylogenomics, genome evolution, evolutionary
epigenetics, or the molecular evolution of aging).
The successful candidate is expected to develop an in-
dependent and internationally visible research program,
supported by sustained extramural funding.
She/he will be embedded in a highly collabora-
tive environment including the three institutes of
the Faculty of Biology (http://www.bio.uni-mainz.de/-
33ENG HTML.php), the research training group
GenEvo (\Gene Regulation in Evolution: From Molec-
ular to Extended Phenotypes"; https://www.bio.uni-
mainz.de/koordinierte-forschungsprojekte), the SFB
1361 (\Regulation of DNA Repair and Genome Sta-
bility; https://www.sfb1361.de/), the Institute of Molec-
ular Biology (IMB; www.imb-mainz.de), the Insti-
tute of Biotechnology and Drug Research (IBWF;
www.ibwf.de), and other faculties of the natural sci-
ences at Johannes Gutenberg University, as well as the
Rhine Main Universities alliance (RMU) with Frankfurt
and Darmstadt).
Contributions to the Bachelor and Master in Biology
as well as Molecular Biotechnology are expected. The
teaching load of W1 professors is reduced compared to
tenured professors. Depending on the candidate's quali-
cation and research direction, the associated budget for
sta and running costs may considerably exceed the re-
sources normally associated with a junior professorship.
A formal association with the Institute of Molecular
Biology may be possible. Furthermore, the successful
candidate is expected to actively involve himself/herselfin academic administration. The professorship is funded
by the Tenure Track program of the German federal and
state governments. Researchers early in their careers
are therefore particularly encouraged to apply.
Applicants must meet the general requirements accord-
ing to public services law and the Higher Education
Act of Rhineland Palatinate ( c 54 Hochschulgesetz -
Higher Education Act). The initial contract will run
for three years and will be extended for another three
years contingent upon a successful interim evaluation.
After a nal successful evaluation after six years and
provided that the general requirements are fullled, the
candidate will qualify for the appointment to a tenured
full professorship (W2).
The State of Rhineland-Palatinate and JGU are com-
mitted to intensive personal mentoring for students and,
therefore, expect a strong presence of teaching sta
at the University. JGU aims to increase the quota
of women in research and teaching, and hence encour-
ages female scientists to apply. Disabled candidates
with appropriate qualications will be given priority.
Collaborative research management and scientic lead-
ership have become increasingly important in the aca-
demic context. For this reason, the Johannes Gutenberg-
University has developed general leadership principles
(www.personalentwicklung.uni-mainz.de/985.php).
Applications including the usual documents (e.g. CV;
copies of certicates; lists of publications and teaching
activities; funding record; current research and future re-
search plans; teaching concept) as a single PDF le and
separately the form available at www.bio.uni-mainz.de/-
1517 ENG HTML.php should be submitted in electronic
form no later than December 11th, 2019 to the Dean,
Faculty of Biology (biologie@uni-mainz.de).
Informal requests can be directed to the chairperson of
the search committee (Prof. Dr. Martin Kaltenpoth;

Darwin Tree of Life project at the Earlham Institute
(EI), based in Norwich, UK.
Background:
This exciting position forms part of theDarwin Tree
of Life Projectto provide high-quality genome assem-
blies for all eukaryotic species in the British Isles. EI,
along with the University of Exeter, will be leading the
analysis of protists (single-celled eukaryote) genomes.
Protists are often referred to as 'biology's dark mat-
ter' as there is so little known about their biology and
biodiversity. There are potentially millions of species,
yet very few have been described. The project aims to
pilot new methods to sample protist biodiversity in the
UK and use comparative genomics tools to study the
ecology and biology of these enigmatic organisms.
The role:
This role will develop, validate and apply high-
throughput methodologies for large-scale sequencing
of protist genomes, including cell sorting and automated
library preparation, and providing continuous improve-
ments and extensions to current systems; this will in-
volve translating single-cell methodologies into robust,
production-scale protocols and generate high-quality
data using these protocols.
Candidates with substantial relevant experience will be
considered for the Senior Scientist post, at grade SC5.
Candidates at an earlier stage in their career will be
considered for the Senior Research Assistant post, at
grade SC6.
The ideal candidate:
Applicants should possess a PhD or equivalent experi-
ence in molecular biology anda good understanding of
modern DNA sequencing technologies. Experience in
the preparation of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
libraries, laboratory automation, and validation of new
protocols is essential. Experience in single-cell and/or
microbial genomics would be advantageous.
The ideal candidate for the Senior (grade SC5) postwill also be familiar with tools and algorithms used
for analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data,
and have demonstrable experience with uorescence
activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis platforms and
single-cell genomics and/or method development in a
genomics context.
Additional information:
Appointments made at the Senior Research Assistant
level (grade SC6) will attract an annual salary of 31,625
- 38,575. Appointments made at Senior Scientist level
(grade SC5) will attract an annual salary of 39,990 -
48,775. Salaries are dependent on qualications and
experience. This is a full-time post for a period of 3
years.
We welcome applications from candidates seeking part-
time or other exible working arrangements.
Interviews will be held on 12 December 2019.

PrincetonU Panama FieldAssistants
GreaterAniProject
Field assistants wanted for study of Greater Ani behav-
ioral ecology for six weeks in early 2020!
Two eld assistants needed for a six-week study of
Greater Ani behavior in central Panama. Field research
assistants will primarily participate in adult capturing
eorts over an intensive six-week season. Duties will
include (but are not limited to) assisting with mist-net
set up and operation, processing (color-banding, mea-
suring, etc.) adult Greater Anis, gear maintenance and
repair, data entry and management, and occasionally
re-sighting banded birds. We are currently looking for:
- Two assistants available to arrive in Panama on Jan-
uary 13, 2020, and depart on February 25, 2020. Appli-
cations will be accepted until positions are lled, but
preference will be given to those submitted by 18 Novem-ber.
Location: Barro Colorado Nature Monument, including
Barro Colorado Island (BCI; central Panama), Smith-
sonian Tropical Research Institute. Researchers and
assistants will be housed on BCI in Smithsonian facili-
ties.
Job description: The Greater Ani (Crotophaga major)
is a cooperatively breeding Neotropical cuckoo with a
unique social system: each breeding group consists of
up to 10 individuals (typically between 2 and 4 socially
monogamous pairs, plus 0-2 nonbreeding \helpers"),
which construct a single nest in which all of the females
lay their eggs. The Riehl lab at Princeton University has
been intensively studying the breeding biology of the
Greater Ani in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument
since 2006.
Our work will occur during the non-breeding season,
with the primary goal of capturing and color-banding
as many adult anis as possible. Although preparation
and data entry will occur in lab space provided on BCI,
nearly all capture eorts will be accomplished via boat.
Our primary means of capturing adult anis is to set
mist-nets around group and communal roosts so that
we can catch birds as they come into roost each night.
Because Greater Anis roost primarily in aquatic vegeta-
tion or vegetation overhanging water, most nets need
to be placed in water. To put it bluntly: you haven't
really mist-netted until you've done it from a boat. Set-
ting and operating the nets can be quite challenging so
either extensive previous experience with mist-netting,
operating a small motorboat in waters similar to those
of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (i.e., lots of
submerged stumps to navigate around), or both would
position a eld assistant for success in this job.
Dates: Start- 13 January, End- 25 February ( ~6 weeks)
Salary: Airfare to/from Panama and research-related
travel within Panama (i.e., getting to/from the airport
and the eld site) will be covered. Room and board
are also fully covered during your stay at the eld site.
The BCI eld station provides primarily dorm-style
housing and three meals a day, seven days a week. A
small weekly stipend is provided for highly qualied
applicants.
Deadline: Preference given to applications received on
or before 18 November.
Qualications: Those with previous eld experience,
especially those who have achieved competency in mist-
netting, and a strong interest in bird behavior are highly
preferred. Other important qualications include: 1.
willingness to work long hours in tropical conditions
(that means buggy, sweaty, muddy, and often wet), 2.78 EvolDir December 1, 2019
ability to get along well with and be respectful of others
in a relatively cramped environment, 3. ability and
willingness to work jointly in the eld and to work in
an area where encounters with venomous invertebrates
are a real possibility (there are plenty of bees, wasps,
and ants; some venomous snakes but not usually en-
countered while we're working), 4. good color vision
(essential for distinguishing color-bands), 5. Spanish
language competency is helpful but not required, 6. Ap-
plicants must have a strong interest in eld research as a
possible or denite career goal, 7. Field assistants must
have a valid passport, 8. Must be able to swim and
comfortable working on a boat, and 9. International
applicants welcome!
Additional Desired Skills: Experience operating a mo-
torboat of ~5 m in length. Greater Anis nest along
shorelines of lakes and rivers, and all the birds we are
attempting to catch live along the waterways of the
Barro Colorado Nature Monument.
Application instructions: Please send the following: 1) a
cover letter ( ~1 page) detailing your interests and career
goals and how you see this position tting in with them,
2) a resume or CV (please keep to relevant details), 3)
the names and contact information (email and phone)
of 3 references (ideally with some experience with how
you work in a research/eld context). Please also in-
dicate the nature of your professional relationship to
EACH reference (e.g., eld supervisor, academic advisor,
professor for a class, etc.).

Dear All,
I'^Am looking to hire a Research Associate for my group.
Kindly forward to suitable candidates or apply your-

receive(d) this multiple times via cross-postings'K.
Best wishes, Erik Hom erik@olemiss.edu

The Hom Lab at the University of Mississippi is seek-
ing a dedicated, full-time Research Associate (RA) to
assist with research and publications, the supervision
and support of students, and overall lab management.
The RA will primarily lead a NSF CAREER-fundedproject on experimentally co-evolving model fungal-algal
mutualisms, but will also be given opportunities to be
involved in several projects in our eclectic research port-
folio (http://darwinsdaemon.com/research.php).
The successful candidate must be self-motivated and
a self-starter, growth-minded, highly disciplined and
organized, able to eectively multitask, and have an
attestable record of productivity and working well with
others. The candidate should have demonstrated experi-
ence working with microbes (fungi and algae are a plus)
and be enthusiastic about learning/developing new tech-
niques, approaches, and research areas. Experience in
molecular genetics, next-gen sequencing/bioinformatics,
and/or 3D-printing/device-tinkering are pluses. We en-
vision strong candidates having a Ph.D. in biology (or
related eld) but welcome applications from candidates
with a B.A./B.S./M.S. degree who have a substantial
laboratory/research background. The expected commit-
ment is for at least two years, with an initial one-year
term with review, and the potential to renew for up to
ve years depending on annual performance.
Our lab is interested in understanding how biotic and
abiotic factors dovetail to facilitate the formation, per-
sistence, and evolution of species interactions, notably
those that are symbiotic. We are particularly fond
of studying associations involving fungi, algae, and
cyanobacteria, and take a two-pronged approach to-
wards understanding how microbes interact to form
stable, functioning communities. In one approach, we
create new ecosystems of interacting microbes (syn-
thetic ecology) to test our predictive understanding of
basic design principles in microbial ecology. In a com-
plementary approach, we focus on dissecting, manipu-
lating, and observing reduced microbial communities
(polycultures) isolated from nature to infer fundamental
rules. Our lab is passionate about STEM education
and outreach to individuals and communities in under-
served/disadvantaged contexts, while pushing forward
an innovative and world-class research program.
The University of Mississippi is located in Oxford, MS,
an idyllic and growing college town about 1 hr south
of Memphis, TN. In addition to SEC sports, a famous
tailgating culture at \The Grove," and a rich South-
ern culinary scene, Oxford is home to a vibrant music,
arts, and literary community with strong historic ties to
William Faulkner and The Blues. Ours is a very livable
city with a small town feel for those who value work-life
balance, community, and proximity to the countryside.
To formally apply, submit application materials here:
https://is.gd/HomRA2020. Candidates should be pre-
pared to upload: (1) a cover letter explaining specic
interest in and t for the position, (2) a detailed CV,December 1, 2019 EvolDir 89

The Kurtz lab \Evolutionary Ecology of Animals", in
the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity at the Uni-
versity of M unster, Germany, invites applications for
a
Postdoctoral Research Associate (salary level 13 TV-L,
100%)
The position will begin at the earliest possible date, and
the initial contract will last for a period of three years.
It is possible to extend the position for a further three
years. The regular working time for a full (100%) posi-
tion is currently 39 hours and 50 minutes per week. As
a rule, vacancies can also be lled as part-time positions
unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so in
individual cases.
The successful applicant is expected to set up his/her
own work group and independently raise third-party
funding. The position is thus equivalent to an Assistant
Professor (non-tenure track).
The job holder should work in the eld of evolutionand ecology of immune systems or host-parasite co-
evolution. Applicants should have an academic degree
and a doctorate in biology. Experience with immuno-
logical, parasitological, molecular or genomic methods
is an advantage.
The Kurtz lab addresses a variety of questions in the
eld of evolution of immune systems and host-parasite
relationships. The research interests of the very inter-
national group range from experimental evolution and
immunological/molecular processes to behavioral adap-
tation. In addition to our beetles, sticklebacks and
copepods also serve as host organisms. Experience with
one of these organisms is advantageous but not abso-
lutely necessary. In addition to conducting research, the
successful applicant will also be involved in teaching in
the elds of animal zoology and evolutionary ecology.
The University of M unster is an equal opportunity em-
ployer and is committed to increasing the proportion of
women academics. Consequently, we actively encourage
applications by women. Female candidates with equiva-
lent qualications and academic achievements will be

limitations of applying evolutionary theory and 'the logic
of chance' to social, economic, and cultural structures
in their historical development.|
2)||| Ethical and societal implications of genome
technologies and neuroscience, such as genetic engineer-
ing, resurrection of extinct species, and direct manipu-
lation of cognition and emotion in the brain, including
in new media.

Practical Exercises
Hello Evoldir community
I teach an introductory course on ecology for rst year
undergraduates. I assume it follows a typical standard
format: two hours per week, mostly lectures, some com-
pulsory reading (mostly \Ecology" by Begon et al.).
In between, we also oer short practical parts, where
the students have the opportunity to experience some
fundamental topics in ecology by themselves. Now, it
is quite challenging to oer a practical experience to
200 students in 2 hours and I was wondering whether
you are willing to share your ideas. In my opinion, such
intermezzi are a great way to spark motivation and to
repeat the theory from the previous lesson.
However, good exercises are often only suitable for small
groups, require a lot of preparation, etc. I am looking
for the exact opposite: Ideally, the exercises require
little preparation, are happening outdoor, are minimally
destructive for the environment, cover central topics of
ecology, allow testing a hypothesis within two hours, are
more or less season-independent, and can be done with
minimal tutoring (using an app?). It is dicult to check
all these boxes, but you get the gist.
If you have a great idea for such an exercise, it would
be great if you could share it. Here are two of ours (we
are looking for a great third one!):
Measuring biodiversity In groups of 24 students (teams
of 4), they learn how to assess plant species diversity in
randomly chosen quadrants. This gives the opportunity
to discuss things such as: how to chose a location ran-
domly, how to quantify heuristically the proportion of
every species in the quadrant, how to calculate a diver-
sity index. By doing this on a gradient from the edge of
a forest to the center, they can also verify whether there
is a change in diversity and you can discuss the reasons
for this (e.g. intermediate disturbance hypothesis). Pergroup, this takes about 2 hours and with the help of
assistants, we can oer ten of these exercises in one
week. Later, you can also combine all results and carry
out some simple statistics to test a hypothesis.
Stage-structured matrix models This exercise is taken
from the great book \Spreadsheet Exercises in Ecology
and Evolution" by Donovan and Welden. I converted it
into an online-course with some documents to download
and work on and some videos that explain what to do.
This allows the students to work independently at home.
The following week, I oer a lesson to ask questions and
clarify things. The downside: it is not a real hands-on
experience, as the student sits in front of the computer.
I am happy to share them, by the way, but I have to
warn that they are in german.
All the best

SouthAfrica Volunteers
StripedMouseProject
Volunteers needed from Dec 2019 / January 2020 on-
wards
Minimum stay 2 months
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
solitary living, and social exibility in the striped mouse
and the bush Karoo rat. One focus is on the adapta-
tion to droughts, combining physiological, behavioral,
ecological and evolutionary research. As these species
are diurnal and the habitat is open, direct behavioral
observations in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Applicants must have
an interest in working in the eld and with animals.
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6
AM), and stops its activity with dusk (7 PM). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40 ^AoC during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for
long periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part
of a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of small mammals; direct behavioral
observations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how
blood samples are collected for physiological measure-
ments and how we measure metabolic rate. Volunteers
are expected to help with maintenance of the research
station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand1750 (around 110 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food in Springbok. Including extras (going out for
dinner; shopping), you should expect costs of about 500
Euros or 600 US $per month.
German students can apply for a grant from
the Deutsche Akademischer Auslandsdienst (DAAD,
www.daad.de). Here, commonly travel grants of 300
Euro are given to students. Students from other coun-
tries are encouraged to seek funding from their home
institutions / home country. Students get an invitation
letter which they can use to apply for funding in their
home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers to
start in December 2019 as well as beginning of 2020.
Volunteers are expected to stay for a minimum of 2-3
months, though longer periods are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

UParis Saclay Internship
BirdBehavior
Internship opportunity (5 months) : Daily foraging rou-
tines in common garden birds using birdfeeders - is the
proverbialearly birdliving in the garden?
UMR 8079 Ecologie, Syst ematique, Evolution (ESE),
Universit e Paris-Saclay, B^ at 362 Orsay in collaboration
with CESCO, MNHN
Carmen Bessa-Gomes (UMR 8079 ESE) Fran cois Chi-
ron (UMR 8079 ESE) Romain Lorrilli ere (UMR 7204
CESCO) Nicolas Deguines (UMR 7204 CESCO)
Timing of feeding and daily foraging routines have been
the object of research in the past, particularly in the
eld of optimal foraging. Daily foraging routines will
inuence energy budgets. Hence, albeit the proverbial
advantage of the \early" bird, past research has high-lighted that under cold temperatures individuals may
delay the beginning of their foraging journey, limiting
the metabolic costs of foraging under cold temperatures.
Daily routines also depend of intraspecic interactions
and subdominant individuals have been shown to have
longer foraging hours in relation to dominant individu-
als. While an early start can reduce competition, it may
increase predation risk, diminishing overall survival. Re-
search on daily foraging routines has often been made in
controlled feeding apparatus focusing on target species
or functional groups. Hence, the role of interspecic
interactions other that predation have received scant at-
tention. Such approaches limit our understanding of the
impact of such interactions, particularly competition.
We propose to further such understanding by examining
the question of daily foraging routines at the community
level using bird feeders for garden birds.
Here we propose to examine the question of daily forag-
ing routines at the community level using bird feeders
for garden birds. We propose to test the following hy-
pothesis:
\Territorial species favour an early/dusk feeding pattern
relatively to species likely to participate in winter forag-
ing ocks"
Other than being present at close proximity to the re-
source, territorial individuals are likely to benet from
their familiarity with the local environment. We pro-
pose that they should reduce the cost of interspecic
competition by feeding before/after the presence hours
of winter foraging ocks.
We propose to test our hypothesis using the citizen
science scheme BirdLab. BirdLab is the rst citizen
science scheme that couples a serious game and bird
observation on a smartphone. It aims at gathering infor-
mation about foraging social behaviours of birds during
winter, using a standardized protocol. Data provided
are species abundance and interactions at feeders. The
participants set up two identical feeders 1-2 meters apart
and lled with sunower seeds. They can record up to
27 species among the most common and easily identi-
ed ones at bird-feeders. A user-friendly app (available
for tablet and smartphone on Android and iOS) repre-
sents the two feeders, as well as icons of the 27 species.
During exactly ve minutes, the participant will drag
and drop these icons between the feeders to mimic bird
movements they see. Hence, timing of bird arrivals,
departures and switch between feeders are recorded in
real time. Participants can repeat this 5 minutes pro-
tocol any time they want during winter season (from
November 15th to March 31th). After ve winters (since
the 15th November 2014), ca. 33,000 5 minutes sessions
have been performed covering the whole France and104 EvolDir December 1, 2019
2,264 participants sent data at least once.
The student will be based at the ESE lab in Orsay,
but there will be regular monthly meetings with all
researchers working on the project. The student will
receive a monthly stipend of 600 euro .
Starting date : February 2020

Full-time (40 h/week)
Fixed-term contract (3 years)
A Postdoctoral position is available at the Institute of
Forest Entomology, Forest Pathology and Forest Protec-
tion, Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, at BOKU
Vienna in the lab of Christian Stauer.
The project aims to unravel factors inuencing phyto-
plasma transmission by plant-sucking insects. Phyto-
plasmas are bacterial pathogens that cause hundreds of
plant diseases aecting many important vegetables and
fruit crops, thus being responsible for high yield losses
worldwide. These pathogens reside in the plant's phloem
and transmission among plants is mainly mediated by
phloem-sucking insects. Apple proliferation is a disease
caused by the phytoplasma Candidatus Phytoplasma
mali. While several phloem feeders occur on apple, only
a small number is able to acquire and transmit phy-
toplasmas. We aim to unravel dierent phytoplasma
transmission pathways in dierent insect vectors using
a population genetic approach.
We are looking for an enthusiastic candidate with a
strong background in next-generation sequencing and
bioinformatic analyses. The candidate will be responsi-
ble to investigate factors aecting transmission eciency
of Phytoplasma mali by the two main vectors Cacopsylla
picta and Cacopsylla melanoneura. Specically, s/he
will perform population genetic analyses of the insects,
its microbiome and phytoplasma strains.
The following activities are planned:
- Insect sampling
- Genome sequencing of dierent insect-vector species
and populations
- Genome sequencing of phytoplasma strains
The project is in close collaboration with Hannes Schuler
(Free University of Bozen-Bolzano), Katrin Janik (Re-
search Centre Laimburg), Rosemarie Tedeschi (Univer-
sity of Turin) and Omar Rota-Stabelli (Fondazione Ed-

FisheriesAdaptationGenomics
The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cor-
nell University (https://www.therkildsenlab.com/) is
looking for a highly motivated postdoc to uncover
genome-wide patterns of variation in American shad
across its distribution range and develop cost-eective
genomic screening tools to aid conservation eorts and
sheries management. The American shad (Alosa sa-
pidissima) is an anadromous sh native to the east coast
of North America. It has for centuries been one of the
region's most important and commercially valuable sh-
eries species - so much that it in the US has been called
\the sh that fed the nation's founders". More recently,
however, the species has faced population extirpations
across its range and despite extensive restoration eorts,
abundances are at historic lows in many areas. Con-
servation planning eorts would substantially benet
from a better understanding of the population structure
and degree of local adaptation in American shad and an
ability to assign ocean-going adults back to their river
of origin.
Earlier microsatellite work detected only weak genetic
dierention across the species range, but shad are dis-
tributed across very heterogeneous environments and
divergent selection may have driven highly elevated
levels of dierentiation in localized genomic regions as-
sociated with local adaptation, a pattern now seen in
many other sh species. The goal of this project is
to conduct genome-wide scans to identify genomic re-
gions that show maximal dierences in allele frequencies
across both small and large spatial scales, and based on
these develop powerful genetic assignment tools for in-
ferring where shad caught as bycatch in ocean sheries
originate from. A better understanding of the natal
origin of shad caught in dierent types of sheries and
dierent areas can help target interventions to activities
that impact the most vulnerable stocks.
The project will be carried out in close collaboration
with the New York Department of Environmental Con-
servation and being based on low-coverage whole genome
sequencing of >400 individuals, it will provide an ex-
citing opportunity to leverage novel high-resolution ge-
nomic techniques to address practical management needs
in a high-prole species while at the same time explor-
ing more basic questions about the forces that drive112 EvolDir December 1, 2019
genome-wide patterns of variation in high gene ow sys-
tems. Exhibiting a remarkable variation in reproductive
strategy and other phenotypic traits across its range,
and recently having successfully colonized the entire
west coast of North America after being introduced to
California in the late 1800s, the American shad has
tremendous, but yet unexplored, promise as a model to
study how species adapt to new conditions - an issue of
urgent importance in our rapidly changing world. The
postdoc will be encouraged to pursue and integrate both
the applied and more fundamental lines of inquiry based
on their interests.
Qualications: Candidates should have completed or be
within 1-3 months of completing a PhD in evolutionary
genomics, molecular ecology, bioinformatics or a related
eld. We are looking for a creative and talented scientist
who is a team player with a good publication record
and excellent organizational and communication skills.
The successful candidate must have a strong computa-
tional/bioinformatics background and previous experi-
ence with analyzing large population genomics data sets.
Experience working in the Unix environment is essential
and familiarity with one or several programming lan-
guages is highly desirable. Molecular lab experience and
past experience with conservation/sheries applications
would also be a plus.
Interested candidates should send their CV, a descrip-
tion of their motivation and research interests and con-
tact information for three references to Nina Overgaard
Therkildsen (nt246@cornell.edu). We are committed to
increasing diversity in STEM and especially encourage
applications from underrepresented minorities. Review
of applications will begin immediately and continue un-
til the position is lled. Pre-application inquiries are
welcome. The start date is January 1 2020, or as soon
as possible thereafter, and the position is initially for
one year, with possibility of renewal for up to two years,
depending on performance.
The position will be based in the Department of Natural
Resources at Cornell University. Our lab is part of the
larger campus-wide Cornell Center for Comparative and
Population Genomics (http://3cpg.cornell.edu) whose
mission includes fostering research, education, and out-

The Group
Cancer is a genetic disease, subject to population genet-
ics forces like mutation, selection and stochasticity. Our
lab has recently demonstrated that coding sequences
of cancer tumors not only exhibit positively selected
mutations that drive cancer (www.biorxiv.org/content/-
10.1101/485292v1), but that there exist genes that the
tumor cannot aord to lose to the mutational pres-
sure (www.nature.com/articles/ng.3987). In addition
to genes, we have also identied cancer driver loci in
the non-coding part of the genome (www.nature.com/-
articles/s41467-017-00100-x). Both coding and non-
coding selection can act to promote cancer defense mech-
anisms against therapy, which can be unveiled through
the analysis of time-sequence data of cell-free DNA and
of patient survival data.
Our lab is particularly interested in how the evolution
and survival of cancer cell populations relies on mutation
inux and in the selection inference from allele frequency
information. To this end, we develop mathematical and
computational approaches to estimate mutation rates
and selection. We use whole-exome sequencing andDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 113
whole-genome data repositories to analyze selection on
coding and non-coding sequences. In addition, we ana-
lyze cell-free DNA from tumors and their temporal evo-
lution in response to therapy. Estimates of the strength
of selection in cancer allow for a prioritization of genes
and non-coding regions by their disease relevance, with
the ultimate goal of promoting therapeutic advances.

BacterialEvolutionInTheGut
Postdoc position: Modeling evolution of bacteria in the
gut (Sorbonne Universit e, Paris, France)
Context and project: The gut harbors a complex mi-
crobiota whose impact on our health is currently being
discovered. In particular, it can constitute a reservoir
of antibiotic resistance, both in humans and in farm
animals. Indeed, 99% of the bacteria we carry are in
our gut. When we take an antibiotic treatment, it can
promote the evolution of antibiotic resistance in these
bacteria. It is therefore crucial to understand how micro-
bial evolution unfolds in the gut. In particular, the gut
is not a well-mixed environment, and the transport of
bacteria and their resulting spatial population structure
likely has a strong impact on their evolution. We aim
to progress towards a better understanding of bacterial
evolution in the gut by developing models of microbial
evolution on graphs, and by taking into account gut ow
and gradients, e.g. of nutrients or drugs. The recruited
postdoc will construct theoretical models of structured
populations, combining analytical calculations and nu-
merical simulations.
Practical information: The postdoc position is funded
for one year and should start in January 2020 at the lat-
est. The recruited postdoc will be co-advised by Claude
Loverdo and Anne-Florence Bitbol. The project will be
performed in the theory group of Laboratoire Jean Per-
rin (http://www.labos.upmc.fr/ljp), a dynamical and
strongly interdisciplinary scientic environment, where
all researchers work at the interface between physics and
biology. Laboratoire Jean Perrin is hosted by Sorbonne
Universit e, on the Jussieu campus, right at the center
of Paris.
How to apply: The candidate should have a PhD
(or have it completed before the start of the posi-
tion) in a relevant eld, and a strong experience in
modeling. To apply, please send a CV and a cover
letter describing your interests and previous work to

PurdueU PlantEvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral position in plant ecological and evolution-
ary genetics at Purdue University
The Oakley lab at Purdue University is looking for a
postdoctoral scholar. Research topics in the lab encom-
pass many aspects of plant ecological and evolutionary
genetics and genomics, but our primary focus is the
genetic basis of local adaptation, and locally adaptive
traits. We use a combination of eld experiments in
native habitats and experiments in controlled growth
chambers to investigate the links between sequence poly-
morphism, ecologically important phenotypes, and ulti-
mately, tness in contrasting environments. The founda-
tion for this work is a decade-long dataset of reciprocal
transplant experiments, trait measurements, and site
level measures of climate variables. Additional research
in the lab is focused on the evolutionary ecology and ge-
netic basis of heterosis and outbreeding depression. De-
velopment of new research directions building on these
themes, and/or developing new approaches to our ex-
isting long-term dataset, is strongly encouraged. There
is a vibrant community of interdisciplinary plant biolo-
gists at Purdue (https://ag.purdue.edu/cpb/faculty/),
providing ample opportunity for interaction and new
collaborations.
Research activities may include (but are not limited
to): Overseeing growth chamber experiments that sim-
ulate native climatic conditions in order to estimate
lifetime tness, freezing tolerance, and other traits, and
likely incorporating RNAseq data; data analysis and
manuscript preparation from these experiments; eldwork in beautiful locations in Italy and Sweden (3-4
trips per year for about a week each); overseeing ongo-
ing development of new genetic resources for mapping
loci of interest; and the potential for development of
mutant lines (using CRISPR-CAS9) to functionally val-
idate candidate genes. A PhD in biology or related
discipline is required, and a strong foundation in R, and
at least a basic familiarity with bioinformatic analysis
on a cluster is strongly preferred. The ideal candidate
will have a broad skill set, having some combination
of wet lab, bioinformatic, and experimental biology ex-
perience. Preference will be given to candidates with
a strong background in evolutionary biology. This is
initially a one-year appointment, with the possibility of
an extension of another year dependent on funding and
performance. The start date is no later than April 1,
2020.
Applicants should send (as a single PDF attachment):
CV, a letter summarizing research interests, accomplish-
ments, and t to the lab and project, and the names
and contact information for two professional references.
Review of applications will begin December 9, 2019 and
will continue until a suitable candidate is found.

The Blaxter lab is looking for an enthusiastic bioinfor-
matician to explore the evolution of chromosomes and
chromosome structure across the tree of life.
Tree of Life (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/-
programmes/tree-of-life) is a new research programme
at the Wellcome Sanger Institute that is exploring
the evolutionary biology of genomes from across the
Eukaryota to understand pattern and process in the
generation of diversity. We are assembling thousands of
high quality genomes, chromosomally-resolved wherever
possible, of protists, fungi, plants and animals. We are
building an analysis group to work on diverse aspects of
the evolution of genomes, their contents and structure,
and their presentation to the wider world.
While organisms and genes evolve rapidly, karyotypes
are relatively stable, such that many genes have been
linked on the same chromosome for hundreds of millions
of years. Chromosomes also have internal structures
that persist through deep time. With the Tree of Life
chromosomal assemblies you will ask what maintains
karyotypes and chromosome structures through time,
and how conserved synteny aects linked gene coevolu-
tion.
This is one of four positions available in Mark Blaxters
lab in the Tree of Life programme at Sanger.

SLU Sweden PlantRootMicrobiome
??Two year postdoctorial position in evolutionary biol-
ogy at SLU Alnarp, Sweden - plant interactions with
antagonists and the root microbiome
Project description
We seek a motivated postdoctoral researcher who will
work on a new project investigating selection of plant
defence against antagonists in wild Solanum in relation
to the composition of the root microbiome in dierent
habitats. An exciting new development in studies of
plant and animal immunity indicates that microbial
composition in the animal gut, or the phylo- or rhi-
zosphere of plants, is a strong contributing factor to
good health. It has been suggested that microorganisms
present on plants may act as an outer, rst layer of im-
mune defence against infection by pathogenic microbes.
To gain a more general understanding of evolution of
plant health, we need to conduct studies in natural pop-
ulations taking into account selective forces generated
by microbial communities and their interactions with
plants.
The project also has important applied aspects for future
development of sustainable plant protection strategies.
The project will be performed in close connection with
integrated plant protection in cultivated potato against
the important potato diseases early and late blight.
Organisation
This position is based in the Integrated Plant Protection
unit at the Department of Plant Protection Biology at
the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU,
Alnarp, Sweden). Our department, is an interdisci-
plinary constellation, encompassing Chemical Ecology,
Resistance Biology and Integrated Plant Protection re-
search units, providing excellent opportunities for strong
research collaboration within and outside the depart-
mental area. Research eorts at the department are
directed towards both fundamental and applied research.Applied plant protection research is carried out in col-
laboration with industry and focuses primarily on the
development of environmentally sustainable pest and
disease control strategies for agriculture and horticul-
ture, both in Sweden and internationally.
Qualications
The candidate should hold a PhD degree in biology or
equivalent. Previous experiences from research in evolu-
tionary biology, molecular biology, interactions between
plants and their antagonists, bioinformatic analyses of
microbiome data or quantication of selection dieren-
tials are merits. Candidates should be uent in spoken
and written English. The candidate must be capable
of independent planning, execution and evaluation of
experiments. As a person you are enthusiastic and re-
sponsible, and have excellent collaborate skills. Personal
skills are therefore an important part of the evaluation.
Applicants that hold a driving license will be evaluated
favorably.
As postdoctoral appointments are career-developing po-
sitions for junior researchers, we are primarily looking
for candidates with a doctoral degree that is three years
old at most.
Closing date 6th of December, 2019.

Postdoc Project: Reproductive Competition and Social-
ity
(Seasonal Unpredictability and Social Flexibility)126 EvolDir December 1, 2019
We are looking for a highly motivated postdoc to join
the striped mouse project www.stripedmouse.com and
our group at the University of the Witwatersrand (Jo-
hannesburg) to study the inuence of the degree of
reproductive competition on sociality. The postdoc is
expected to apply for a 2 years postdoctorial fellowship
at the University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg,
South Africa) with us and to spend most of the time at
the Succulent Karoo Research Station, conducting eld
work, analysing and publishing long-term eld data.
Application deadline is next week, with skype interviews
taking place Thursday the 21st and Friday the 22nd
November.
The call has just been published and deadline for ap-
plication is already the 6th of December, the decision
being expected to be made before Christmas 2019, onset
of the project in the rst halve of 2020. We have an
existing research proposal for the project outlined below,
so the successful applicant would be able to submit her
/ his proposal by the 6th of December if she / he can
work the last week of November on it.
Project: For the project, a long-term dataset on so-
cial organisation of striped mice will be available for
analyses (from 2003 to present) and further data collec-
tion will extend to 2021. Sociality (% of solitary versus
group-living striped mice) will be studied in relation
to population density and the intensity of reproductive
competition, which is (i) very high during the spring
breeding season when all females breed, (ii) absent dur-
ing most summer dry seasons, (iii) low during summers
with unexpected rains when few females breed (6 out of
17 summers in the current data set).
Questions and predictions: We expect that reduced re-
productive competition during summer breeding will
lead to more social instability in spring compared to
summer, i.e. groups to be more stable in summer. We
will also study which factors dier between females that
breed during the summer vs. females that don't. Fi-
nally, the impact of rare summer breeding on population
dynamics will be studied.
Key requirements: Strong statistical skills. Good un-
derstanding of social evolution. Strong CV with 3 pub-
lications from the PhD and at least 1 publication per
year from postdoc studies, some of them in high rank-
ing journals (impact factor >3). Willingness to spend
considerable time in the eld in South Africa. Ability
to analyse data and to write manuscripts while being
eld based.
What you will learn: Strong eld skills. The postdoc
will spend considerable time in the eld (at least 1.5 of
the 2 years). It is expected that the postdoc will prepareand start analysing the database while being based at
the Succulent Karoo Research Station in South Africa

The Integrative Ecology Lab (iEcoLab) at Temple Uni-
versity is seeking creative and productive applicants for
a postdoctoral researcher to lead research into the inva-
sion genetics of the invasive spotted lanterny (Lycorma
delicatula) pest. The spotted lanterny is an invasive
Asian planthopper that was rst introduced to the US
just outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2014, and
has since spread to ve nearby states. In addition to nat-December 1, 2019 EvolDir 127
ural dispersal, human-assisted dispersal occurs during
all lanterny life stages: adults and nymphs hitchhike
on cars and it can spread long distances in the egg
stage because it lays eggs on mobile outdoor objects
like recreational vehicles and landscaping materials. It
feeds on over 70 plant species, sometimes at very high
densities, including economically important species like
maples, apples, hops, and grapes. Invaded vineyards
have lost entire crops, aecting wine production. We are
just beginning to understand its ecology and potential
to cause economic and ecological impacts, but there
is still more to learn. You can be at the forefront of
cross-disciplinary research on this emerging invasion.
The postdoctoral researcher will be mentored by Jocelyn
Behm (https://www.iecolab.org/jocelyn-e-behm/) and

The anticipated start date for the invasion genetics post-
doc position is early 2020. The position is for one year,
with the possibility for renewal upon satisfactory per-
formance and funding. Salary is commensurate with
experience and benets are included.

of human-assisted versus natural dispersal to spotted
lanterny spread, as well as elucidate dispersal corridors
and pathways in its invaded range. There will also be
opportunities for the postdoc to develop and pursue
additional research questions based on their interests.

Postdoctoral Position in Ecological Speciation at the
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
We are seeking a postdoc to work on an NSF-funded
project on ecological speciation in plants. The project is
particularly focused on the contribution of mating sys-
tem evolution to the evolution of reproductive isolation
and character displacement between incipient species of
Clarkia xantiana, an annual plant with a long history
of research in evolutionary biology. The project is a
collaboration among two labs at the U. of Minnesota:
Dave Moeller (moellerlab.wordpress.com) and Yaniv
Brandvain ( brandvainlab.wordpress.com). The project
integrates eld experiments, population genomics, and
mathematical modeling.
We are particularly interested in candidates with ex-
pertise in ecological genetics, evolutionary ecology, and
population genetics, along with potential interest in de-
veloping skills in genomic analysis. Some of the major
goals of the project are to (1) examine the role of natural
selection in the evolution of reproductive character dis-
placement using a combination of mathematical models
and eld experiments, (2) quantify the ecological and
genetic costs of hybrid formation using eld experiments
and genomic analysis, and (3) assess the consequences of
pre- and post-zygotic isolating mechanisms for genome-
wide patterns of introgression. As a part of the broader132 EvolDir December 1, 2019
project, we are sequencing and assembling the genome
of C. xantiana.
Initial appointment will be for one year with compet-
itive salary ( $48,426) and full benets. Renewal for
1-2 more years is possible, pending excellent perfor-
mance and mutual agreement. The start date is ex-
ible. To apply, please assemble (i) a one page cover
letter that highlights how your research interests and
skills t with this project, (ii) a CV, and (iii) names
and contact information for three professional refer-
ences. Materials should be submitted online at https:/-

UppsalaU AvianMalaria
Uppsala University is a comprehensive research-intensive
university with a strong international standing. Our
mission is to pursue top-quality research and education
and to interact constructively with society. Our most
important assets are all the individuals whose curiosity
and dedication make Uppsala University one of Swe-
den's most exciting workplaces. Uppsala University has
44.000 students, 7.100 employees and a turnover of SEK
7 billion.
A position as a researcher in avian malaria is available
at the Department of Ecology and Genetics, animal
ecology.
The Department of Ecology and Genetics is an inter-
national environment with sta and students from all
over the world. Our research spans from evolutionary
ecology and genetics to studies of ecosystems. For more
information, see www.ieg.uu.se . Project description:
Vector borne diseases are a major threat to human,
domesticated and wildlife populations. Many vectors
are bloodsucking insects that rely on olfactory cues for
nding their meal. These olfactory cues can be ma-
nipulated by the pathogen to ensure transmission. We
will use avian malaria to study the chemical ecology
of vector borne pathogen transmission. First, we willinvestigate how particular malaria strains and the birds'
MHC genes determine odour proles. Second, we will
use a combination of blood-feeding behavioural tests
and RNAseq to reveal the genetic basis to variation in
vector responses to host odour proles. We predict that
specic avian malaria strains aect their vectors such
that they avoid hosts with MHC genes that would allow
the host to defend themselves. Our results will also lead
to predictions of specic combinations of genotype fre-
quencies of hosts, pathogens and vectors that promote
pathogen transfer resulting in more infected individuals
in the population.These predictions will be tested using
data from geographically separated populations. We
also predict that the pathogen strains that are most
eciently transmitted between hosts also are the most
virulent ones. Our ndings will be relevant in the gen-
eral context of predicting and preventing the spread of
vector borne pathogens. Our results will in particular
contribute to improved general guidelines for predictions
of the likelihood and consequences of pathogen range
expansion.
Duties: Analyze and publish already available data,
perform experiments in the eld and contribute to the
future development of the project.
Qualications required: A doctoral degree, or a for-
eign degree equivalent to a doctoral degree, in ecology
and/or evolution. Previous experiences with analyses of
genomic data are required. Candidates must be able to
express themselves uently in spoken as well as written
English. In ranking eligible candidates special impor-
tance will be given to scientic skills.
Qualications desired: Earlier experiences of eld work
on birds are desired.
Application: The application should include 1) a letter
of intent describing yourself, your research interests and
why you want this position, 2) your CV, 3) a short

Sanger Institute that will explore the evolutionary bi-
ology of genomes from across eukaryote diversity to
understand pattern and process in the generation of
diversity. To do this, we will generate many thousands
of high quality genomes, chromosomally-resolved wher-
ever possible, of protists, fungi, plants and animals. We
are looking for up to four postdoctoral bioinformatics
researchers to join Mark Blaxter's group to work on
diverse aspects of the evolution of genomes, their struc-
ture, their analysis and their presentation to the wider
world.
Post 1: Phylogenomics We aim to build a continually
updated tree of life from the genomes generated in the
Tree of Life programme at Sanger and elsewhere. This
post will deliver software solutions to identify orthology,
build alignments and compute phylogenies across all
sequenced genomes. In addition to resolving a species-
level tree, these data will be used to understand the
dynamics of gene family change through evolution, and
map the conicting roles of introgression, hybridisation
and horizontal gene transfer in producing conict in tree
estimation. The ideal applicant will have experience in
both software pipe-lining in a production environment
and in large scale phylogenetic inference. A keen interest
in the diversity of life and understanding of the nuances
of genome evolution would be desirable.
Post 2: Chromosome evolution While organisms and
genes evolve rapidly, karyotypes appear to be relatively
stable. In addition, chromosomes have internal struc-
ture that persists through phylogenetic time, such that
many genes have been linked on the same chromosome
for many millions of years. What maintains chromo-
some structures through time? What does karyotypic
conservatism mean for linked gene coevolution? These
questions will be explored using the breadth of genomes
sequenced in the Tree of Life programme across a range
of evolutionary distances. The ideal applicant for this
post would be a computational biologist comfortable
with large data and able to develop algorithms to de-
scribe and model chromosome evolution.
Post 3: Genomes within genomes Nearly one third of
eukaryotic species are parasites, and many eukaryotes
host prokaryotic endosymbionts. We have built toolkits
for eective separation of cobiont genomes from their142 EvolDir December 1, 2019
hosts, and this post will use these tools to survey and
describe the diversity of symbionts within the thousands
of genomes delivered by the Tree of Life programme.
Do these cobionts cospeciate with their hosts, or do
they jump regularly? What novel symbionts are there
in the majority of unsequenced life? How do symbiont
genomes evolve? The ideal applicant would be comfort-
able with genome assembly and interpretation, and in
particular have an interest in investigating pattern and
process in symbiont genome evolution.
Post 4: GenomeHubs We are developing a genome
databasing package, GenomeHubs (see https://-
genomehubs.org) based on Ensembl, that communities
of researchers can use to deliver custom solutions for
sharing and analysis of genome data. This post is for a
curator/developer who will support our several taxon-
oriented communities in installing and maintaining their
instances of GenomeHubs, train users (including gen-
erating online training materials), and assist in the
development of new functionality. The post will involve
considerable travel and collaborative working, and so
the ideal applicant will have experience in programming
and genomics databasing and a desire to communicate
and train a diversity of fellow scientists worldwide. This
position is funded in part by the UK BBSRC.
General The post holders will work closely with others
in the Tree of Life programme and Mark Blaxter's evolu-
tionary genomics group. Within the underpinning need
to deliver a whole solution to their overarching goals,
all the posts will have independence in dening research
focus and in establishing key collaborations.
All posts are for 3 years in the rst instance, with
prospect for extension.

sitions to study behavioural genomics and molecular
ecology of wild bees. The Rehan lab is a collaborative
group of researchers, sta, and students focusing on
bee behaviour, ecology and evolution. We are located
at York University in Toronto, Canada. The candi-dates will join a vibrant team of integrative biologists
passionate about all things bee.
*Behavioural Genomics Position*
This postion will examine nutritional ecology of wild
bees to determine pollen preference and nutritional re-
quirements of native pollinators. There is increasing
evidence that bee health is mediated not only by the
quantity, but also quality of food provided during de-
velopment. This researcher will conduct eld and lab
experiments to determine optimal diets for bee nutri-
tion and pollinator health. We are also interested in
the eects of maternally provisioned diet and mother-
ospring interactions on social behaviour. We encourage
the candidate to develop research projects on the social
evolution and behavioural genomics of wild bees.
The successful candidate will have skills in a relevant
area, and a strong background in behavioural ecology
and evolution. Analytical and writing skills as well
as familiarity with transcriptomic and genomic data is
highly desirable.
*Molecular Ecology and Population Genomics Position
*
This position will develop genomic reference material
and environmental samples for the wild bees across east-
ern North America. We have a rich database of existing
material and are actively working to develop robust
dataset for wild bees in the northeast as well as under-
standing habitat requirements and oral hosts using a
mix of metabarcoding, phylogenomics, historic reference
data and ongoing eld surveillance. This researcher will
help manage a eld crew, analyze complex genomic and
ecological data, write manuscripts and and engage in
public outreach and educate events across Toronto.
The successful candidate will have skills in a relevant
area, and a strong background in molecular ecology and
population genetics. Analytical and writing skills as
well as familiarity with genomic data and bioinformatics
is highly desirable.

Dear all,
registration is now open for our course \An introduction
to computational Bayesian methods" :
Website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course46/ )
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
When: 25-29 March 2019
Instructors: Prof. Shravan Vasishth and Bruno Nicen-
boim (University of Potsdam, Germany)
In this course, we seek to cover this gap, by providing
a relatively accessible and technically non-demanding
introduction to the basic workow for tting dierent
kinds of linear models using Stan. To illustrate the
capability of Bayesian modeling, we will use the R pack-
age RStan and a powerful front-end R package for Stan
called brms.
After completing this course, the participant will have
become familiar with the foundations of Bayesian in-
ference using Stan (RStan and brms), and will be able
to t a range of multiple regression models and hierar-
chical models, for normally distributed data, and for
log-normal, poisson, multinomial, and binomially dis-
tributed data. They will know how to calibrate their
models using prior and posterior predictive checks; they
will be able to establish true and false discovery rates
to validate discovery claims, and to carry out model
comparison using cross-validation methods, and Bayes
factors

courses-workshops/course59/ )
Where: Free University Berlin (Germany)
When: 10 'V 14 February 2020
COURSE OVERVIEW
New advances in sequencing technologies have opened
the door to more contiguous genome assemblies due to
the increased length of obtained fragments. Although
there is a setback in accuracy, a broad range of algo-
rithms has been developed to cope with it. This course
will introduce the audience with a spectre of methods
which are present in a usual assembly workow, start-
ing from raw data and nishing with a fully assembled
genome. We will see how to obtain nucleotide sequences
from raw signals, dive deeper into the most used assem-
bly paradigm for long fragments, try out and compare
several state-of-the-art assemblers, and at last, assess
the quality of the obtained assembly with and without a
reference genome. Structured over ve days, this course
consists of both theoretical and practical aspects which
are intertwined through each day. The presented the-
oretical foundation will be applied on small bacterial
datasets and visualized in order to better grasp the
algorithms at hand.
TARGETED AUDIENCE
This course is intended for researchers interested in learn-
ing the concepts of algorithms for de novo genome as-
sembly with Oxford Nanopore Technologies data. Both
beginners and more advanced users will nd useful in-
formation in the presented matter. Course attendees
should bring a laptop with either macOS or any Unix
version. Some background in using mentioned operating
systems via the command line is desirable, but we will
cover the needed essentials throughout the hands-on
sessions.
LEARNING OUTCOMES * Learn the advantages anddisadvantages of third generation of sequencing. * Un-
derstand the concepts of de novo genome assembly. *
Obtain practical experience on using state-of-the-art
tools for de novo assembly and assembly quality assess-
ment.
Outline
Monday 'V Session1: Introduction
This course starts with a general introduction to sequenc-
ing and assembly. The audience will get familiar with
Oxford Nanopore sequencing, how it works, its advan-
tages and disadvantages. Afterwards, we will transform
a subset of a bacterial dataset, containing electric cur-
rent signals, into a set of nucleotide sequences with error
rate higher than previous generations of sequencing.
Session2: Stitching fragments
Sequencing technologies are still unable to read the
whole genome at once, therefore the obtained fragments
need to be joined together. We will rst try and use
sequence alignment, the basis of many bioinformatics
tools. As it is not feasible for larger amounts of data, we
will investigate a heuristic approach that uses short sub-
strings of predened length (Minimap). We will discuss
the trade-o between execution time and sensitivity,
and its impact on assembly contiguity, and apply this
method on a small bacterial dataset.
Tuesday 'V Session3: Unknotting graphs
Given the set of pairwise overlaps between fragments,
we will build an assembly graph from which the genome
can be reconstructed (Miniasm). The graph will look
like a yarn ball due to the sheer amount of overlaps.
Step-by-step, we will introduce and apply several simpli-
cation methods to untangle the graph. There will still
be knots in the graph which occurred due to sequencing
errors. We will examine and try to resolve them. After-
wards, contiguous chains of fragments will be extracted
and used in the next phases.
Session4: Polishing until it shines
Contigs from the assembly graph will have accuracy as
the sequencing yield and will be unusable for most down-
stream analyses. Therefore, we will map all fragments
to the assembly and create a multiple sequence align-
ment with partial order graphs (Racon). Retaining the
most frequent base in all fragments at a given assembly
position, we will iteratively try to increase the overall
accuracy. Once we reach the maximum, we will see if
we can further improve the assembly by using signal
level data (Nanopolish).
Wednesday 'V Session5: Quality assessment
Quality of the assembly is important for downstreamDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 151
analysis so we will assess it in three dierent aspects:
base accuracy (MuMmer) and completeness (QuastLG)
given the reference genome, and protein prediction (or-
thologs (BUSCO) and ORFs (Ideel)). We will cover
each appropriate tool and apply them on our assembly.
Session6: State-of-the-art
We will go through the basic concepts of several state-
of-the-art assemblers such as Canu, Redbean, Flye, etc.
We will apply each of them on the same dataset and
create an evaluation consisting of contiguity, accuracy
and the amount of resources needed.
Thursday 'V Session7: State-of-the-art continued
Session8: Group task
Attendees will get several sets of fragments obtained
with Oxford Nanopore

Next generation sequencing has revolutionized evolu-
tionary biology allowing unprecedented resolution and
insight into evolutionary questions that appeared in-
tractable only a few years ago. The course will cover
the basics of population genomic analysis from SNP
data onwards and will cover the key analyses that may
be required to successfully analyze a population ge-
netic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-152 EvolDir December 1, 2019
nomic analysis and be competent in population genomic
analysis.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
This workshop is aimed at postgraduate students and
early career researchers who are interested in using pop-
ulation genomic tools in their research. No previous
experience of bioinformatics is required, but an under-
pinning in evolutionary biology and basic population
genetics concepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
and FST are desirable. The course will use a range of

Course: \Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data"
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
When: 23-27 March 2020
Course website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course18/ Instructors:
Dr. Kirk Gosik (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard)
Dr. Dana Silverbush (Broad Institute of MIT and Har-
vard)
Dr. Orr Ashenberg (Broad Institute of MIT and Har-
vard)
Course overview
In recent years single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has
become widely used for transcriptome analysis in many
areas of biology. In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-
seq provides quantitative measurements of the expres-
sion of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze
scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some
of the underlying assumptions for the methods devel-
oped for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid.
In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq
processing, starting from the raw reads coming o the
sequencer. The course includes common analysis strate-
gies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss
the central biological questions that can be addressed
using scRNA-seq.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The
material is suitable both for experimentalists who want
to learn more about data-analysis as well as computa-
tional biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq
methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can
be applied to any experimental protocol or biological
system.
The requirements for this course are:
i- Working knowledge of unix (managing les, running
programs)
ii- Programming experience in R (writing a function,
basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages).
iii- Bioconductor experience is a plus.December 1, 2019 EvolDir 153
iv- Familiarity with NGS data and its analyses (using
alignment and quantication tools for bulk sequencing
data)
Teaching Format
The course will be delivered over the course of ve days.
Each day will include a lecture and laboratory compo-
nent. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion
and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical
hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will
be done using a combination of tools installed on the
attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed
via web browser.

State University, Fort Collins, CO
Dates: May 31 to June 6, 2020
Website: https://gdwworkshop.colostate.edu Applica-
tion deadline: January 3, 2020.
GDW2020 is an intensive, hands-on workshop focused
on the application of powerful genomic tools to moni-
tor, detect and investigate the role of pathogens within
both wildlife and domesticated species. To date, the
GDW 2017-2019 series has trained 73 researchers (43
women, 30 men) of which 25% were international sci-
entists. Post-workshop participant surveys gave high
scores for GDW workshops with a cumulative average
of 4.7 of 5 for overall scientic value and 4.8 of 5 for
overall venue experience.
Why is the workshop needed? Advances in genomic
technology now provide an extraordinary opportunity
to rapidly assess the impact of disease in wildlife bio-
diversity, management, and conservation. Wildlife and
animal health researchers are uniquely positioned to
merge ecological, biological, and evolutionary studies
with genomic technologies to generate unprecedented
Big Data tools in disease research. The workshop will
provide a venue to accomplish this goal, will provide
networking opportunities for colleagues from intersect-
ing interests, and will advance genomic tools in wildlife
and animal health disease investigations.
How will the workshop address the need? GDW2020 will
provide essential training to those with skills and inter-
est in some or all of the following: Wildlife Biology and
Ecology, Disease Ecology and Modeling, Evolutionary
Biology of Host and Pathogen, Pathogen Surveillance
and Discovery, Animal Health and Veterinary Sciences,
Genome Science and Bioinformatics, Diseases of Domes-
ticated Species and Livestock
Attendees will conduct analyses of genomic data of both
host and pathogen. The course will provide: an overview
of current bioinformatics developments and approaches;
guidance to implement genomic tools in study design;
NGS data analysis and interpretation; and, opportuni-
ties for interaction with peers, core faculty, and invited
experts.
Workshop Syllabus The workshop will cover a typical
workow commonly used in NGS analyses starting with
the initial raw sequence through the nal stages of iden-
tifying host:pathogen variants linked with disease. Each
day of the workshop will cover an essential component
of the NGS workow in succession.
Morning sessions will be a series of instructional lec-
tures and demonstrations that will concisely present154 EvolDir December 1, 2019
the purpose, justication and implementation of the
specic workow unit. Short and exciting ash talks
presented by CSU faculty will present some of their
ongoing investigations using genomic tools in both host
and pathogen.
The afternoon sessions will be computer intensive labs
in which attendees will perform analyses with genomic
data for each workow topic.
Evening plenary lectures from invited faculty will con-
clude each day's activities.Teaching tools will include
exercises using NGS data from a range of pathogens
and host species.
Participants will learn the importance of integrating
NGS data from both host and pathogen in order to
better understand current epidemics in wildlife.For the
duration of the course, each attendee will be provided
with a MacBook Pro computer and peripheral equip-
ment, and prepared genome datasets from several host
species and associated pathogens. These datasets will
be organized into various les and formats prior to the
course, demonstrate key concepts, and be the foundation
for computer exercises and teaching tools.

Course details: The need for eective and informed
analysis of biological sequence data is increasing with
the explosive growth of biological sequence databases.
A molecular evolutionary framework is central to many
Bioinformatics approaches used in these analyses. Ad-
ditionally, explicit use of molecular evolutionary and
phylogenetic analyses provide important insights in their
own right, e.g., analysis of adaptive evolution in virusesDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 155
providing clues of their interaction with host immune
systems.
To this end, we aim to provide graduate and postgradu-
ate researchers with the theoretical knowledge and prac-
tical skills to carry out molecular evolutionary analyses
on sequence data. The course will entail data retrieval,
alignment techniques, phylogeny reconstruction, hypoth-
esis testing, and population genetic approaches. The
course will cover sessions on analysis of both protein
and nucleotide sequences, including NGS data.
Also, the EMBO Practical Course will oer a unique
opportunity for direct interaction with some of the world-
leading scientists and authors of famous analysis tools
(Maria Anisimova, Bastien Bousseau, Bruce Rannala,
Alexandros Stamatakis, Benjamin Redelings, Ziheng
Yang, etc.) in evolutionary Bioinformatics.
Note that the last three courses in Crete were heavily
over-subscribed. The expected participant acceptance
rate is below 20%. Experience from previous years has
led to preference being given to candidates who:
are doctoral candidates in the early to middle stages
of their thesis research already have some familiarity
(i.e. have already used some of the relevant tools) with
phylogenetic methods have already collected/assembled
a molecular sequence dataset to analyze in their work
have experience working in a Unix/Linux command-line
environment We will also select a small fraction of par-
ticipants that already work in Bioinformatics labs, to
intensify collaboration between early career stage Biolo-
gists and Bioinformaticians. Applicants from labs with
a strong focus on computational molecular evolution
methodology need to carefully outline their motivation
for attending the course in this context, since they have
ready access to expert supervision and are likely to be
very skilled already in the topics we teach, or are in the
course of becoming very skilled therein.
Travel grants: A limited number of travel grants are
available for participants. Applicants do not need to
apply separately for travel grants for this event but
should indicate on the registration form if they wish to
be considered for a travel grant. Selection of awardees
is handled directly by the organizer who will notify all
eligible participants. More information is available at

subject to selection. As a consequence, understanding
the genetic basis of complex morphological, life-history,
physiological, ornamental and behavioural traits is cru-
cial if we are to understand their evolutionary potential,
and the evolutionary process in general.
Quantitative genetics uses the phenotypic resemblance
among related individuals to infer the role of genes and
the environment in shaping phenotypic variation. De-
pending on the species, we can use data obtained from
breeding experiments under controlled conditions (e.g.
insects, plants), or from individual-based monitoring pro-
grams in the wild (e.g. birds and mammals). Especially
the latter has beneted greatly from the application
of animal model methodology, originally developed in
animal breeding to identify individuals of high genetic
merit. By simultaneously using the resemblance among
all individuals in the pedigree, these methods provide
more precise and accurate estimates of genetic and non-
genetic variance components (heritabilities and genetic
correlations). Furthermore, they allow for the estima-
tion of individual-level genetic eects (breeding values),
and thereby the inference of evolution.
In this course we will cover everything from basic quan-
titative genetic theory and statistics to advanced mixed
model-based approaches. You will learn how to estimate
genetic variances and covariances in wild and captive
populations, and how to test for evolutionary change.
Along the way, you will be exposed to a range of general
statistical methods (including generalised and mixed
models), the R packages MCMCglmm and ASReml-R
in particular. Furthermore, we will discuss a number156 EvolDir December 1, 2019
of landmark papers that have put the concepts and
methods covered during the lectures and practicals into
practice to address fundamental evolutionary questions.
You are strongly encouraged to bring your own data
(if you have them), which you will be able to work on
during the course and which will allow you to put the
theory into practice.

Malta ConservationGenomics
Jan20-22
Dear all, we are pleased to announce that applications
are now open for the rst Training School of our COST
Action G-BIKE which will be held in *La Valletta
(Malta) from January 20th to 22nd, 2020*: *Genomic
tools for conservation: a practitioner's guide*
Overview This Training School will be mainly, but not
exclusively oriented towards practitioners, with the aim
of presenting, in the simplest and yet most comprehen-
sive manner, the contribution that can be provided by
genetics and genomics for eectively tackling practical
conservation and management problems. The underly-
ing rationale for the School is to create a bidirectional
information ow between scientists and practitioners
to explore and clarify where and when genomics can
make a dierence in every day conservation within an
EU policy and legislative framework, but with global
application. To this end, trainees will be asked to oer
at the beginning a short presentation about the main
conservation challenges of their current jobs where they
think genetic tools might help. At the end of the School,
we will revisit these presentations, discussing the op-
tions and potential strategies that can be applied using
the genomic and analytical tools described during the
School. We hope to enable those involved to go back
to their respective positions armed with a plan that
they can then put into practice! This School may also
be relevant to graduate students about to embark on
conservation genomics projects to help them develop
workplans, and just as important, to allow them to make
their work policy and management oriented from the
outset.
For details, please visit the G-BIKE website <https://-
sites.google.com/fmach.it/g-bike-genetics-eu >.
*Deadline for applications is December 8th, 2019. Se-
lected trainees will be granted a full reimbursement
(travel, lodging) from G-BIKE COST Action*

Course description This course on Landscape Genetics
provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary train-
ing and provides an overview of the eld of landscapegenetics. The course caters to students in basic and
applied ecology, conservation and population genetics,
landscape ecology, evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion biology. A key objective of landscape genetics is to
study how landscape modication and habitat fragmen-
tation aect organism dispersal and gene ow across
the landscape. Landscape genetics requires highly in-
terdisciplinary specialized skills making intensive use of
technical population genetic skills and spatial analysis
tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools and remote sensing).
Even when students receive disciplinary training in these
areas, educational programs often lack the necessary
linkage and synthesis among disciplines. This linkage
can only be accomplished after experts from each dis-
cipline work together to develop guiding principles for
this new research area.
Landscape Genetics will be concurrently oered at mul-
tiple universities across the globe, giving students the
opportunity to learn from international experts and work
with peers from outside institutions. For students who
are not members of the participating institutions, we
are oering a web-based online course to reach a broader
audience. Each course meeting will start with a live web-
cast lecture (no special software required) by an expert
on the topic that introduces foundations and methods
and highlights points for discussion in local seminar
groups. After breaking out into local course group dis-
cussion (including a discussion group for online course
students), a web-based discussion across campuses will
wrap up the weekly topic. Students who are unable
to make it to live-cast of lectures can view taped lec-
tures. In addition, students can choose to participate in
an optional lab section using R and/or interdisciplinary
group term projects with web-based collaboration across
institutions. The nal two options are provided to help
students develop analytical skills in Landscape Genetics.
Students who participate in group projects will have the
option of applying to attend a project synthesis meeting
in Toronto Canada in May 13-17 2020 after the IALE
North America meetings. See more information here:

When to register: by January 8
Faculty who would like to add a local section of the
course at their university can register as a group or
multiple students at one institution can register as aDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 159
group. For faculty who set up local sections, we would
expect you to set up course credit at your institution,
participate in the course with the students and grade
assignments (we provide answer keys for assignments).
For individual students or students in small groups (
<4) without a local instructor) who need course credit,
you can have your advisor set up an independent study
course at your home institution and turn in specic
assignments during the semester that will be evaluated
by our online instruction team. This can be set up as
pass/fail or grading on A-F scale. It is easiest for us if
you pick the pass/fail option. In the US system, this
would count as a 2 credit course for the lecture portion,
and students who choose to do all labs or participate in
a group project would receive an additional credit.
You will be invoiced for the course in early January and
can pay by credit card or check.

Course Description The term \meiofauna" refers to tiny
animals capable of passing through a ~0.5-mm mesh.
Many meiofaunal animals are interstitial, meaning they
burrow in marine sediments. Several entire phyla (such
as kinorhynchs, gastrotrichs, and gnathostomulids), ma-
jor clades of other invertebrate phyla (especially arthro-
pods, nematodes, annelids and atworms), and minia-
turized representatives of most other animal phyla are
meiofaunal. Meiofaunal animals have been estimated to
account for half of the biodiversity in complex biotopes
such as coral reefs, with most of it associated with sedi-
ments. While the great phylum- and class- level diversity
of meiofauna is well-known, the species-level diversity re-
mains largely unexplored and undocumented. By some
estimates, the number of species of meiofaunal nema-
todes alone that waiting to be formally named dwarfs
the number of already described meiofaunal species by
two orders of magnitude. Morphological studies of meio-
fauna have led to groundbreaking insights about their
evolution, adaptation, and functional biology (e.g., ad-
hesive and sensory structures), as well as fundamental
insights into the evolution of the major animal groups
in the tree of life. More recently, advances in molecular
biology ranging from DNA barcoding to metabarcoding
to whole-genome sequencing have accelerated the pace
of the study of all aspects of the biology of meiofauna.
The overarching goal of this course is to help train
the next generation of marine invertebrate taxonomists.
Specically, the course is designed to familiarize partic-
ipants with the vast biodiversity of marine meiofauna
through eld and laboratory work. We will take a
taxon-survey approach to emphasize the development
or enhancement of practical skills essential for collec-
tion, identication, characterization, preservation, and
molecular analysis of meiofauna. Sampling of diverse
habitats near Fort Pierce (e.g., Capron Shoal and local
beaches) and the Florida Keys (e.g., coral reefs, rubble
elds, mangroves, and beaches) by snorkeling, SCUBA160 EvolDir December 1, 2019
diving, and boat (grabbing/dredging) will provide a
wealth of specimens of diverse taxa for our investiga-
tions. Note that SCUBA-certied participants will have
the opportunity to dive recreationally in the Florida
Keys at their own expense/risk, but the course will not
involve scientic diving.
Morphological laboratory work will emphasize the prepa-
ration of specimens for microscopic examination and
sorting to the level possible with light microscopy. Par-
ticipants will have the opportunity to collect specimens
of meiofaunal animals for their own research (if desired)
and will be expected to compile and contribute species
lists, images, and metadata to public databases.
Molecular laboratory work will begin with training in
basic molecular lab skills and DNA barcoding for partic-
ipants not already familiar with these techniques. Sub-
sequently, participants will learn transcriptome (cDNA)
and genomic DNA sequencing library preparation tech-
niques that can be used on single meiofaunal animals.
Each participant will have the opportunity to sequence
at least one transcriptome or one mitochondrial genome
as part of the course.
The course is limited to 8 students and will be taught
in English. We use the term \student" broadly and will
consider applicants at diverse career stages interested
in studying meiofauna.

Spain ConservationGenetics
Jan27-31
Many conservation genetics tools have been developed
for use in temperate other high latitude habitats, and so
not all of these tools translate to the tropics. Tropical
habitats share some features which complicate the ap-
plication of some conservation genetics tools which are
heavily relied upon in higher latitudes, and also share
some basic questions and problems that are less of an
issue in higher latitudes or other, better studies and/ or
less diverse habitats.
This course will discuss practical issues, genetic and
genomic theory, tools and analyses as applied to issues
relevant to conservation in the tropics. Some basic
questions of conservation importance include describ-
ing species diversity, determining species distributions,
characterizing the basic biology of species, and under-
standing demographic history and population size and
structure. Underlying biogeographic histories that have
shaped communities, and the biotic interactions within
those communities are also of fundamental importance.
There is an optional, personalized conservation genetics
project immediately following the lecture and computer
practical week.
This course is designed with students and practitioners
of Conservation Biology or Conservation Genetics in the
tropical regions of America, Africa and Asia in mind.
This course will take place January 27-31, 2020 in the
Biological Reserve of Do nana (Spain).

21-22nd September 2020 (prior to the ISBA9 conference)
PROPOSED LOCATION:TBA, Toulouse, France
Dear all, We are circulating a 'registration of interest'
survey for an ancient metagenomics workshop, possibly
to be held as a satellite-meeting the two days prior to
ISBA9 (https://isba9.sciencesconf.org/). This workshop
will revive the Standards, Precautions and Advances
in Ancient Metagenomes workshop that was held in
2016, which resulted in the guidelines published in A
Robust Framework for Microbial Archaeology (https:/-
/doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035526). We
are currently developing a proposal to hold this meeting
and ask for your input.
We would like to have a round table discussion meeting
between active PhD and postdoc researchers working
in this area of research to share experiences, challenges,
and propose practical solutions for the eld in both
data generation and analysis. We aim to announce the
outcomes of this workshop at the closing ceremony of
ISBA9, including an (in-)formal 'community'/network
for continued interaction, and to develop an opinion
paper in which we: -Discuss major issues -Outline rec-
ommended technical best-practices in ancient microbial
genomics -Dene metadata standardsAnnounce the net-
work
We would be grateful if you could forward the above
information your students and early career researchers
to get their feedback and register their interest.
Please submit your registration of interest form by 30th
January 2020.

SLiMEvolModeling Mar6-10
Hi all.
March 6-10, 2020, a ve-day SLiM workshop will be
oered at the University of Iceland (Reykjav k, Ice-
land). It will be hosted by Sn ~Abj orn P alsson and Arnar
P alsson, of the University of Iceland (H ask oli  slands).
It will be free, and open to participants outside of the
university. HOWEVER, registration is required, a lim-
ited number of seats are available, and priority will be
given to registrants aliated with the University. To
apply, please send an email to BOTH Sn ~Abj orn and
myself (snaebj@hi.is, bhaller@mac.com) with the info
below. The deadline for applying is the end of the day
on 10 January (late applicants may be considered if
there is room), but priority for University applicants
will end on 13 December; after that date it will be rst-
come-rst-served so that we can notify everyone of their
acceptance in time to make travel arrangements. Early
application is advised.
As background: SLiM is a software package for creating
evolutionary models/simulations that are individual-
based and genetically explicit. It is scriptable, exible,
fast, and includes an interactive graphical modeling en-
vironment. You can read more about it on its home
page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
THIS IS THE ONLY WORKSHOP I AM LIKELY TO
RUN IN EUROPE UNTIL MID-2021. The dates for
it have been chosen to dovetail with the Oikos con-
ference in Reykjav k, which is March 3-5 (https://-
www.oikos2020.org); we hope that this will make the
workshop more convenient for many to attend. Note
that early registration for Oikos lasts until December
2nd, and then the price goes up, so if you wish to attend
the conference as well, act quickly.
For this workshop, your application email should include:
(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any otherforward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM that
you hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted.
The plan is to cover all the major topics in the SLiM man-
ual, starting with lots of introductory material to get be-
ginners up to speed with SLiM and its associated script-
ing language Eidos, and ending up at advanced topics
like non-Wright-Fisher models, tree-sequence recording,
continuous-space models, and nucleotide-based models.
We won't cover everything in the manual - that would
be overwhelming! - but we'll try to cover all the big
topics. There will also be time for attendees to work on
their own models with help from me, and we may also
have time to explore some optional side topics that are
of particular interest to those attending each workshop.
The workshop will be taught principally using SLiMgui
on macOS. Every attendee will need their own Mac
laptop, but a limited number of Mac laptops *might*
be available on-site for those who do not have one, and
running macOS inside VirtualBox on another operat-
ing system is also possible. (A Mac is required to run
SLiMgui, which is necessary for teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).
Cheers,

The Center for Health in the Human Ecosystem of the
University of Idaho (Moscow, ID, U.S.A.) hosts the an-
nual Biology of Vector-borne Diseases six-day course.
This course provides accessible, condensed training and
\knowledge networking" for advanced graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, faculty and professionals to ensure
competency in basic biology, current trends and devel-
opments, and practical knowledge for U.S. and global
vector-borne diseases of plants, animals and humans.
We seek to train the next generation of scientists andDecember 1, 2019 EvolDir 163
help working professionals to more eectively address
current and emerging threats with holistic approaches
and a strong network of collaborators and mentors.
The course is both lecture- and discussion-based and
is delivered by internationally recognized experts,
with integrated case studies of emerging vector-borne
pathogens to highlight parallels and key distinctions in
biology across plant, animal and human vector-borne
diseases. This course sets an example of new vision,
through leadership of the Center for Health in the Hu-
man Ecosystem, to create an enduring community of
participants and instructors to expand the impact and
sustainability of these approaches.
The course is scheduled for Sunday through Friday, June
21-26, 2020. The applications portal is open now. Appli-
cants will be notied of their acceptance and invited to
register for the course. The course registration fee (USD
$1,500) includes housing, meals, course materials and
social activities. Registration fee will be due following
acceptance into the course.

the concept and idea of DNA barcoding, BOLD and
mBRAVE barcode repositories and analyzing tools, in-
ternational DNA barcoding activities (iBOL), metabar-
coding methods and high-throughput sequencing plat-
forms, analyses of ancient DNA, analyses of microbial
communities, bioinformatic pipelines of genomic-scale
data and use of some ecological analyses using R statis-
tical platform.
The practicals will include lab exercises on both standard
DNA barcoding and metabarcoding (for Ion Torrent),

platform and exercises on using BOLD and mBRAVE.
Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but164 EvolDir December 1, 2019
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
