at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp for
MEEGID XIII, the leading conference on the molecular
evolution of all pathogens: viruses, pathogenic bacteria,
fungi, parasites and prions. Special emphasis (through
plenary lectures, express debates and symposia) will
be given to health problems of specic interest to the
present world including: Ebola; tuberculosis; AIDS;
malaria; cancer and infectious diseases.
Plenary lectures and symposia will also deal with
transversal topics such as population genetics, evolution,
speciation, bioinformatics, whole genome sequencing
analysis and omic analyses. Together, the MEEGID
congress series and its companion journal, Infection,
Genetics and Evolution represent a unique forum for
cross-fertilization between evolutionary science in the
broad sense and biomedical research on infectious dis-
eases.
Attending this conference will enable you to access
unique, high-quality content, learn about the latest
developments in infectious diseases and epidemiology
research from experts in the eld, present your latest
research to your peers and network with an interdisci-
plinary group from around the world - including aca-

Jan10-14
Registration for the 2016 Asilomar conference of the
American Society of Naturalists will close in ~two weeks.
The American Society of Naturalists will be holding a
small independent meeting at the Asilomar Conference
Center on the Monterrey Peninsula in coastal California,
January 10-14, 2016. The goal of the meeting is to
promote integration between evolution and ecology by
attracting a more diverse community of biologists than
typically attend the evolution meetings held jointly eachsummer by ASN, SSE, and SSB. All attendees will have
the option to present their research in talks or posters
which will be grouped by topic.
Information about the conference can be found on the
conference website: http://www.amnat2016.org includ-
ing a general schedule and information about three
afternoon symposia and exiting evening events. To reg-
ister, visit: http://www.amnat2016.org/register.html
Lodging must be booked separately: http://-
www.amnat2016.org/foodandlodging.html The confer-
ence is limited to 200 people due to meeting space
constraints, so we expect the conference will ll up com-
pletely. We therefore encourage potential attendees to
register shortly after the registration period opens.
Who should attend: We invite graduate students, post
docs, or faculty from elds related to ecology, evolution,
behavior, genetics or associated elds who are interested
in big-picture and integrative research into patterns and
processes in biological diversity. The meeting is not
restricted to ASN members, but newcomers are encour-
aged to join the society. The conference will be kept
small to encourage new conversations. ASN is subsi-
dizing student and post doc registrations to encourage
graduate students and post docs to attend the meeting.
We look forward to seeing you there! Sincerely, Volker
Rudolf ASN Organizing Committee Chair

In addition to fantastic symposia, this year's program
includes Natural History Quizbowl, a debate on \The
Niche", and bonre socials to cap o the day. The fac-
ulty:student ratio is also really high, and the conferenceOctober 1, 2015 EvolDir 5
size is small, so it should be a great opportunity for
early career scientists and graduate students to network
and get feedback on research. There are only a few

Austin TX EvolutionArt Jun17-21
The 2016 Evolution conference (the annual meeting of
theSociety for the Study of Evolution, theSociety of
Systematic Biologists, and theAmerican Society of Nat-
uralists) will be held from June 17-21 in beautiful Austin,
TX. In conjunction with the meeting, the societies and a
local art gallery (Art.Science.Gallery) are co-sponsoring
an evolution-themed art exhibit. The exhibit will pro-
vide an opportunity for meeting attendees and others
to showcase their creative talents, increase the visibility
of the meeting and the societies to the local community,
and provide opportunities for public education about
evolutionary biology through the exciting lens of visual
arts. The exhibit will run at the Art.Science.Gallery
leading up to, and during, the conference, and a selection
of the works will be on display at the Austin Convention
Center as a pop-up exhibit during the evening of the
opening reception of the meeting.
Art.Science.Gallery has issued an open call seeking sub-
missions for this exhibition. Works may explore (but
are not limited to) the sub-disciplines within evolu-
tionary biology, notable evolutionary biologists, current
research topics, important discoveries and concepts, and
the history of evolutionary thought. You need not be a
member of any of the societies to submit something for
consideration.
Pass the word along and, if you're at all artisticallyinclined, consider submitting something. Additional
details can be found on our new permanent meeting

17th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS FORUM
Friday, 20 November 2015, 9:30 am Venue: Flett Lecture
Theatre, Natural History Museum, London, UKOctober 1, 2015 EvolDir 9
The annual Young Systematists Forum represents an
exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE. Send applications by e-mail to
(YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com), supplying
your name, academic or contact address, stage of your
career (MSc student, PhD student, postdoc) and stat-
ing whether or not you wish to give an oral or poster
presentation. Space will be allocated subject to avail-
ability and for a balanced programme of animal, plant,
algal, microbial, molecular and other research. Non-
presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately. There will also be
a meeting on Natural History Collections and Climate
Change Research on the 17th (details to be announced
shortly). Come for a full week.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than Friday 23 October 2015. The body text should
not exceed 150 words in length. If the presentation is co-
authored, the actual speaker (oral) or presenter (poster)
must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

International Conference on Polyploidy, Hybridization
and Biodiversity
11-14 May 2016, Rovinj, Croatia
Dear Colleagues,
It is our great pleasure to inform you that International
Conference on Polyploidy, Hybridization and Biodiver-
sity (ICPHB 2016) will be held from May 11 to 14,
2016 in Rovinj, Croatia (http://www.hbd-sbc.hr/en/-
icphb2016/). This conference presents cutting edge
research into the importance of polyploidy in genetics,
evolution and ecology. The topics of the conference are
organized in three core sessions: (1) the long-term and
(2) immediate consequences of interspecic hybridiza-
tion and polyploidy. These explore eects over deep
time and shallower time frames and focus on genet-
ics and epigenetics. The nal core session will be: (3)
polyploidy in light of ecological genetics where we will
discuss current data showing eects of hybridization
and polyploidy on phenotypes, niche occupation and
ecology. While previous polyploidy meetings have been
dominated by plant research, there is now much exciting
new data from animals and fungi, areas we are partic-
ularly keen to encourage. On behalf of the organizing
committee, we cordially invite you to join the confer-
ence to communicate with the distinguished speakers
and share your research results.
Call for Presentation and Attendance
You're welcome to attend our conference (without
presentation) or submit your abstract through reg-
istration system for an oral and poster presenta-
tion (http://www.hbd-sbc.hr/en/icphb2016/abstract-
submission/). We would extend our highest appreciation
and warmest welcome to your attention and attendance.
Your participation will be essential to the success of the
conference.
Istrian experience with traditional dinner
Rovinj is one of the most developed tourist destinations
in Croatia, boasting rich natural and cultural heritage
with beautiful landmarks such as the old town and the
lush Zlatnirt (Punta corrente) forest. Zlatnirt is a pro-
tected forest park, while Rovinj's islands and coastal
area are protected landscapes/seascapes. During the10 EvolDir October 1, 2015
conference participants will have opportunity to travel to
mystic Middle ages of Svetvinaenat in Morosini Grimani
castle - legend about Mare the witch from Svetvinaenat
enriched with the fair of autochtonous products, degus-
tation of Istrian delicacies, learning the istrian typical
music and folk dance - balunia.

Uppsala EuroEvoDevo Jul26-29
After the vibrant 5th meeting of the European Society
for Evolutionary Developmental Biology (EED) in Vi-
enna in 2014, we are pleased to announce that the 6th
meeting is going to take place in Uppsala, Sweden, from
26 to 29 July 2016. Details will soon be provided to
you.
Today, the Scientic Committee of the EED invites pro-
posals for short symposia for the Uppsala conference.
It is the aim of our conferences to stimulate the com-
munication between subdisciplines and researchers from
dierent countries. We therefore particularly encourage
submission of symposia on broad and integrative topics
of potential interest to researchers from dierent elds
(e.g., developmental biology, genetics, palaeontology, ge-
nomics, theoretical biology). Symposia that combine
animal and plant studies are particularly welcome. Ide-
ally, speakers should come from several countries, not
just from those of the proposed organizers. Symposia
can accommodate 4 invited speakers and allow 25 min-
utes for each speaker (20 minutes talk and 5 minutes
discussion). Please note that speakers can only present
in a single symposium. To facilitate selection of sym-
posia for the program, please include the following in
your proposal:
(1) Title of symposium
(2) Provisional list of proposed speakers
(3) Brief (abstract length) description of the sympo-
sium, including a short indication of what the dierent
speakers are expected to contribute
(4) Brief justication of why the symposium is appro-
priate for an EED meeting (e.g. timeliness, general
interest, interdisciplinarity)
(5) Contact information of all symposium organizers12 EvolDir October 1, 2015
(6) Please indicate whether you intend to seek external
nancial support for your symposium
Please submit your proposal before September 4th, 2015.
All submissions should be sent to: eed.soc@gmail.com
(Please, do not reply directly to this message to submit
your proposal)
Please note that the EED does not provide nancial
support for speakers invited to a symposium, and theSociety thus encourages symposium organizers to seek
external support for their symposium.
We look forward to receiving your suggestions for sym-
posia!

Aber GutMicrobeEvolution
Graduate position in Biological, Computational and
Mathematical characterisation of microbial dark matter
from the rumen.
Project description: Gut microbes are vitally important
to the health, eciency and environmental impact of
their animal hosts and especially for ruminants as they
allow access to the nutrients in forage that would other-
wise be inaccessible to the animal. However, as only a
small percentage of the predicted numbers of microbes
in the rumen have been successfully cultured, most
of the genomic information collected so far has come
from culture-independent techniques, such as metage-
nomics. The genomic information retrieved from the
'unknown' organisms, termed 'microbial dark matter',
can constitute 40% of all the sequencing data and its
characterisation is one of the greatest challenges to fully
understanding the gut microbiome. We are looking
for a talented and motivated scientist to take on this
challenge.
This Ph.D. project will utilise the vast amount of experi-
ence and data produced in IBERS from the rumen micro-
biome, coupled with expertise from the departments of
computer science and mathematics to address this press-
ing issue. The successful candidate will gain world-class
expertise in microbial genomics, metagenomics analyses
and computational biology. They will be a member of
the ecological and evolutionary genomics lab (http://-
www.creeveylab.org) under the direct supervision of Dr.
Chris Creevey (http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/ibers/sta/-
chc30/) in IBERS.
The fully funded 3-year PhD scholarship pays UK/EU
university tuition fees (currently 4,052pa) and a stipend
of 14,057 per year. Applicants should hold, or expect to
obtain, a minimum of a rst or good upper-second class
honours degree (or equivalent) in a relevant subject (e.g.
Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, Computer Science or
Mathematics). Contact the lead supervisor Dr. Chris
Creevey (chc30@aber.ac.uk) to discuss the project.

AmphibianAdaptations
Graduate position in evolutionary systems approaches
to understanding visual adaptations in amphibians.
Amphibians are a model group for studying sensory
receptors, allowing perception of the environment they
inhabit, and multiple times have independently devel-
oped successful adaptations in both nocturnal and di-
urnal species (i.e. the size of eyes, photoreceptor cells
and associated visual pigments). As the amphibians
represent the most ancestral group of the tetrapod ver-
tebrates, understanding the genetic underpinnings of
the evolutionary adaptations in their senses will further
our understanding of how novel biological innovations
arise.
This Ph.D. project will utilise the expertise from Aberys-
twyth University, Leeds University, Bristol University
and the Natural History Museum UK, to tackle the
problem of nocturnal versus diurnal adapted visual sys-
tems. The successful candidate will learn phylogenomic,
molecular evolution techniques as applied to biological
systems and will be registered in Aberystwyth Univer-
sity. They will be expected to spend time at each of the
partner institutions during the project. The successful
candidate will benet from novel transcriptomic data
collected by both IBERS researchers and collaborators
and will gain world-class expertise in genomics, evo-
lution and bioinformatics. They will be a member of
the ecological and evolutionary genomics lab (http://-

AncientMicrobeDNA
Paleoclimate analysis using ancient microbial DNA: The
history of Antarctic melting
A PhD project is available at the Australian Centre for
Ancient DNA (https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/) to
use ancient Antarctic microbial records to reconstruct
the impacts of past climate change. Microbial DNA
preserved in ice cores will be used to reconstruct the
history of Antarctic ice sheet behaviour over the last full
glacial cycle (from 130 kyr), with major implications
for understanding past periods of rapid sea level change
and for providing baseline measures for global climate
change models. The project has strong potential to
make major contributions to our understanding of past
climate change, and for informing predictive models for

PhD position in theory/analysis of gene regulation
A PhD position is available in the group of Prof.
Erik van Nimwegen at the Biozentrum of the Uni-
versity of Basel and Swiss Institute of Bioinformat-
ics (http://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/groups-
platforms/overview/unit/nimwegen/). We are looking
for highly motivated individuals with strong mathe-
matical and computational skills that are interested to
perform theoretical and computational research in the
area of gene regulation.
Our research group is highly interdisciplinary, involv-
ing both an experimental section where researchers
with a background in molecular biology are experimen-
tally studying genome evolution and gene regulation
at the single cell level in bacteria, and a theoretical
section where researchers with backgrounds in theoreti-
cal physics, computer science, and applied mathematics
are using techniques from Bayesian probability, evolu-
tionary theory, dynamical systems theory, and stochas-
tic processes, to study the function and evolution of
genome-wide regulatory networks in cells. We are par-
ticularly interested in uncovering the principles by which
genome-wide regulatory networks specify and maintain
cell identity in multi-cellular organisms, how cells con-
trol and exploit the noise in gene regulatory processes,
and how gene regulation evolves. A list of our group's
publications can be found https://scholar.google.ch/-
citations?user=3DN24KB1wAAAAJ . Our lab also takes
part in a number of collaborative projects within Switzer-
land including StoNets, which studies the ways in which
cells control and exploit stochasticity in gene regula-
tory networks, and BrainStemX, which studies the gene
regulatory networks underlying mammalian forebrain
development. The precise topic of the PhD research
project will be determined jointly with the candidate
and candidates that display initiative and independence
will be given priority.
Candidates should have strong mathematical and com-
putational skills, and experience in such areas as stochas-
tic processes, dynamical systems theory, and Bayesian
statistics is a plus. Candidates do not necessarily have
to have a biological background but should have a strong
desire to directly work with experimental biological data
and collaborate with experimental biologists. The candi-

pathogens. Alternatively, this work could focus on the
patterns and mechanisms that drive the structuring of
within-host symbiotic communities of aphids. FISH
microscopy and bioinformatics will be among the tools
utilized for this research, and both are supported by
strong infrastructure and opportunities for training at
Drexel.16 EvolDir October 1, 2015

PopulationGenomics
PhD Scholarship in population genomics
A PhD Scholarship in population genomics is available at
the National Institute of Aquatic Resources (DTU Aqua;
www.aqua.dtu.dk) with starting date December 2015.
The scholarship is part of a larger Nordic collaborative
project, MarGen, nanced by the EU Interreg Oresund-
Kattegat-Skagerrak Programme and the Danish Rod
and Net License Funds. The project will primarily be
carried out at the population genetics group in the Sec-
tion for Marine Living Resources which is situated in
Silkeborg, Denmark. DTU Aqua is an institute at the
Technical University of Denmark.
Project description Marine shes are valuable models
for studying evolution in natural populations; however,
population genetic research has so far been restricted to
relatively few well-studied species. Interestingly, locally
adapted populations have been identied, even underhigh levels of reproductive connectivity. Technological
developments in molecular characterization of genome-
wide variation allow evolutionary questions, for example
related to the number and size of genomic regions under
selection, to be addressed in a much broader range of
species. In this project, the candidate will work on
sh populations from the transition zone between the
full marine eastern Atlantic and the brackish water in
the Baltic Sea. From this area, unique physiological
adaptations to the dierent environments have been de-
scribed, even in species which normally show low levels
of population structure. The candidate will use high
throughput genomic methods to generate genome-wide
population genetic data for species distributed across the
transition zone. Attaining genome-wide coverage in a
number of species, hereunder atshes, across the same
environmental gradient will facilitate general evolution-
ary insights on population divergence and adaptation to
diverse environments. Such knowledge is also important
for sustainable management of biodiversity in the region,
and the candidate will work in the interphase between
basic and applied science.
The successful candidate will be responsible for the anal-
yses and publication of population genomic data from
several species, thus strong analytical skills and inter-
ests are required. The candidate will also contribute to
teaching at the Aquatic Science & Technology Masters
programme at DTU Aqua and to the supervision of
Bachelor and Master students.
Qualications - We are looking for a candidate who has a
Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Biology, Computer
Science or Engineering - A background in population
genetics and/or bioinformatics is preferred - Experience
with analyses of next generation sequence data or other
large scale genomic data sets will be advantageous -
Keen interest in research and the eld of marine and
aquatic sciences - Prociency in written and spoken
English
Salary and appointment terms The salary and appoint-
ment terms are consistent with the current rules for
PhD degree students at DTU; starting salary is around
3300 EUR per month + pension savings. The period of
employment is 3 years.

FloridaIntlU EvolutionAdaptation
Graduate Student (PhD) positions available in Dr. Eirin-
Lopez's Chromatin Structure & Evolution Lab (De-
partment of Biological Sciences, Florida International
University) starting in Fall 2016.
We are looking for enthusiastic, dynamic and indepen-
dent students broadly interested in studying the inter-
face between evolution, epigenetics and adaptation in
marine organisms. Students would ideally have a B.S.
degree in Biology or related discipline (academic training
in biology, statistics, genetics and evolution) and must
be procient in English (both spoken and written). Can-
didates with additional knowledge on computer science
and/or bioinformatics are encouraged to apply. Our
research addresses the study of chromatin and epigenet-
ics from dierent perspectives, most notably evolution,
development and adaptation. To this end we use marine
invertebrates as model systems in the lab, as well as a
wide range of eukaryote groups in molecular evolutionary
analyses. Our current projects combine elements from
marine biology, toxicology, molecular biology, biochem-
istry, next generation sequencing, bioinformatics and
molecular evolution to address environmental problems
in the oceans. Our work requires good organizational
and computational skills and the ability to work collab-
oratively as part of a team. Detailed information about
our research is available at our website (chromevol.com).18 EvolDir October 1, 2015
Follow us in Facebook (facebook.com/chromevol) and
Twitter (@chromevol).
Potential research topics include (but are not limited
to):
1) Characterization of epigenetic mechanisms underly-
ing environmental responses and adaptation in marine
invertebrates. This research addresses the roles of DNA
methylation, histone variant modications and other epi-
genetic mechanisms during responses to environmental
stressors, notably by using bivalve molluscs and corals
as model organisms.
2) Development of high-throughput \-omic" tools im-
proving pollution biomonitoring in coastal areas. This
topic focuses on the development of methods that can
be routinely used to identify early exposure of marine
organisms to genotoxic pollutants (e.g., microarrays,
qPCR, proteomic analyses, etc.), specially in the case
of commercially relevant shellsh, marine mammals and
other megafauna.
3) Molecular evolutionary and phylogenetic analysis of
chromosomal proteins in metazoans. This objective
builds on the molecular evolutionary tradition of our
group, studying the mechanisms governing the diver-
sication/dierentiation of gene and protein families
across eukaryotes and their consequences for organismal
evolution.
Related research topics are also welcome. Interested
students will be required to apply to the Graduate
Program in the Dept. of Biological Sciences at FIU
(http://biology.u.edu/graduate/). Acceptance in the
lab will be subject to successful application for Teach-
ing Assistantship funds (TAs). Interested students are
also strongly encouraged to apply for graduate research
fellowships (e.g., National Science Foundation Graduate
Research Fellowship). In order to be considered, qual-
ied candidates must submit a statement of interest,
curriculum vitae, unocial transcripts (GPA scores),

PhD Studentship in Genomics and Molecular Evolution
Liverpool John Moores University - School of Natural
Sciences and Psychology
Duration of Studentship: 36 months.
We have a fully funded studentship for a doctoral stu-
dent to join Dr Maxim Kapralov in an exciting project
at the interface between Genomics, Molecular Evolution
and Plant Sciences. The position is available immedi-
ately and applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
Please note that due to funding regulations the position

Project title: Disentangling three billion years of co-
evolution between Rubisco and its chaperones for crop
biotechnology.
Project description:
Population growth puts increasing demands on agricul-
ture while the world's crop productivity is stagnating.
At the same time eciency of photosynthesis has been
little changed, and remains below its biological limits.
The next green revolution will be based on increasing
the eciency and productivity of photosynthesis in crop
plants via its re-engineering using computational and
genetic techniques, and will be one of the greatest scien-
tic challenges in the coming decades for both academia
and business alike.
The aim of this project is to answer the question \Could
we improve global crop yield by re-engineering key pho-
tosynthetic enzymes and their chaperones using evo-
lutionary algorithms?" which involves understanding
of molecular coevolution between the Rubisco enzyme
complex and its numerous assembly and catalytic chaper-22 EvolDir October 1, 2015
ones, which performance limits photosynthetic eciency
in plants. Bioinformatics analysis will be combined with
genetic engineering of model organisms to prove the
validity of the concept that plant productivity could be
increased by re-engineering Rubisco and its chaperones.
The student will develop skills in bioinformatics and
biotechnology - two areas with high employability in
academia and private sector alike. Training in com-
putational and molecular laboratory techniques will be
provided at the Liverpool John Moores University by Dr
Maxim Kapralov, while training in the state of the art
plant transformation and biotechnology techniques will
be provided by Dr Spencer Whitney during student's
visit to the Australian National University.

ancillary RAF1 chaperone. Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, 112(11), 3564-3569.
Any specic eligibility requirements:
The project is predominantly computationally-based
and can accommodate a person with bioinformat-
ics/modelling/computational/structural biology back-
ground who is willing to get his/her hands 'wet' for
a short period during PhD and develop experimental
skills to broaden his/her horizons. However, candidates
with 'wet' laboratory background who have some bioin-
formatics/coding experience and are willing to walk this
extra mile and develop their computational skills are
encouraged to apply too. Applicants should have a rst
or a very good upper second undergraduate degree (or
overseas equivalent) in either bioinformatics or biology.
In the rst instance make an informal enquiry by e-
mail to Dr Maxim Kapralov m.v.kapralov@ljmu.ac.uk
by sending a CV with contact details of two academic
referees. Your e-mail should have as its subject \Appli-
cation for PhD". It is essential that you give the grades
of all degrees and state your nationality.

change-induced range shifts for pest spread and persis-
tence. With both applied and theoretical outcomes, this
project oers the opportunity to provide information
relevant for pest management, biosecurity and conser-
vation biology, while developing novel methodologies
in landscape genomics. The candidate will apply the
latest genome sequencing technologies and bioinformat-
ics approaches, including identifying functional genes
involved in local adaptation and opportunities for simu-
lation modelling.
The successful candidate will be encouraged to develop

Dear all,
In the framework of B10K (http://b10k.genomics.cn/)
I am building a team to address the sequencing of all
species within the family Anseriformes. We have re-
cently aquired the funds for sequencing the genus-phase
of Anseriformes and the project is going to start as soon
as possible. One species for each genus of this bird fam-
ily will be genome-sequenced by the B10K standards.
This will contribute to the overall aims of B10K as well
as Anseriform-specic aims, such as questions regarding
the genomics of hybridisation and species boundaries,
or the evolution of the immune system.
There are more than 50 genera in the Anseriformes and
my group will therefore have access to a large number
of genomes to be analysed comparatively in this frame-
work. I am searching for a motivated and talented PhD
candidate to become part of my team. We expect you to
be skilled in Linux-based remote computing, and have
experience with genome-scale data analysis. Wet-lab
or eld work is not intended to be part of this project.
Signicant challenges lie ahead in the data analysis and
comparative genomics of this non-model bird group!24 EvolDir October 1, 2015
Additionally, although the rst steps will as usual be
technical bioinformatics, the prospective PhD student
is expected to be grounded in Ecology and Evolution,
and follow an agenda to ignite questions on the overall
biology of Anseriformes in this context.

MonashU EvolutionaryTheory
A PhD project is available at Monash University ^As
School of Biological Sciences (Melbourne, Australia) to
work with Tim Connallon. I am seeking highly moti-
vated students who wish to carry out original research
in evolutionary theory. Candidates should have a solid
work ethic, a deep curiosity about evolutionary biology,
and strong communication skills. Prior experience with
mathematical and/or simulation modelling will be a
plus.
Project overview: Evolutionary biology and ecology
rely heavily on mathematical models that facilitate con-
ceptual links between empirical observations and the
evolutionary and ecological processes that can give riseOctober 1, 2015 EvolDir 27
to them. Models provide us with the means to bet-
ter understand the data that we have, and to make
new and testable predictions that motivate future ex-
periments, new data collections, and novel statistical
analyses. The PhD research will involve developing new
models with these general aims in mind. The research
will fall broadly within the realm of evolutionary theory,
though specic details are exible, and each project
will be developed by collaboration. Areas of current
interest in the lab include (but are not limited to): {
The evolution of sexual dimorphism { The maintenance
of genetic variation in quantitative traits and tness {
The genetic basis of adaptation { The role of genetic
constraints in adaptation { The evolution of genome
structure and organization { Sex chromosome evolution
{ Interactions between dispersal and local adaptation
The student could also potentially carry out original
analyses of publicly available data, including large-scale
genomic and transcriptomic datasets.
The successful candidate will apply for a scholarship
package through Monash University, which provides a
tax-free annual stipend (current rate of AUD$25,849
p.a., equalling $994 per fortnight) and full waiver of
tuition fees for the duration of the doctoral program

(via funding to T.C, and with the same rate of support)
are available for qualied applicants. The successful
student can further supplement their annual income by
contributing to undergraduate teaching, by acting as a
laboratory class demonstrator and tutor. All research
expenses will be fully covered, as well as costs associ-
ated with all postgraduate coursework and conference

Thesis context
Crops have undergone and are still undergoing domesti-
cation. Over the past 12,000 years mankind has sampled,
selected, cultivated, migrated and colonised new envi-
ronments, inducing all manner of bottlenecks, drifts and
selection. On the whole, plant domestication redirected
plant development and adaptation to meet the needs of
human populations. Moreover domestication induced
spectacular phenotypic variation. As an example, cur-
rent cultivated varieties of Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.)
are grown under extreme water regimes from strictly
dryland elds to deep water sites with up to 6-7 meters
water (in the Bengal delta), as well as under tempera-
ture regimes from equatorial plains to elds at 3000 m
elevation along the Himalayas or northernmost regions
beyond 50N latitude in China, or in Europe. Despite ap-
parent quantitative reduction of genetic diversity during
domestication, new traits and capacities appear among28 EvolDir October 1, 2015
domesticates and still continue to appear with mod-
ern breeding. Inbreeding is obviously a major way for
phenotypic variation to be realized, as are occasional
spontaneous hybridizations between diverged forms and,
later, directed hybridizations by the breeders. Yet fully
novel variation may also appear. The waxy gene in rice
is one of the best documented cases (review by Vaughan
et al, 2008). Other examples have arrived since then,
particularly in barley, for virus resistance (Honger et
2011 and Yang et al. 2014)), for photoperiod sensitiv-
ity (Faure et al. 2012; Pankin et al. 2014) and for
boron tolerance (Pallota et al. 2014), and on legume
crops (Weller et al. 2012) for earliness. In farm animals
such as pigs, coat color variation results of intentional
selection for alleles that appeared after the advent of
domestication (Fang et al. 2009). Globally one may
argue that most of de novo variation is actually adaptive,
because it has been xed or has become frequent in a
very short time in evolutionary terms. And for crops,
one may also argue that the selection pressure applied
by many farmers on numerous plants every year is likely
to be very ecient in detecting and stabilizing those
new useful variants that appeared through mutation.
We want to harvest those genes that are part in this
process.
The research proposed will use rice as a model for mining
germplasm collections for adaptive polymorphisms and
alleles that have emerged during plant domestication
and adaptation to diverse environments. Our vision
is that we can make a great use of a unique model
plant and a unique set of new data in order to explore
an original approach. * A unique model plant: Oryza
sativa, the rice species of Asian origin, is an essential
crop for food security. It has a wealth of diversity, both
phenotypic and genotypic, with strongly dierentiated
varietal groups such as the so-called Indica and Japon-
ica groups, whose mode and place of domestication is a
source of intense debate among scientists. Rice is being
studied under multiple facets in Montpellier and there is
a wealth of expertise in our community. * A unique set
of new data: the '3k RS'. A set of 3,000 accessions have
been subjected to deep Re-Sequencing and the data
have been publicized (3K RGP, 2014) together with a
call for coordinated action in terms of data analysis (Li
et al. 2014). * An original approach: focussing on de
novo variation. DNA sequence variations keep memory
of time and this is easily accessible when working within
small genetic distance windows. Alleles phylogenies
can be drawn which highlight recent variation emerging
under positive selection. Phylogeographic analyses of
landrace diversity enables pointing out adaptive de novo
diversity. Part of it can be tentatively identied as the
most recent alleles that are present at the fringe of/

and evolutionary dynamics in natural populations. We
are seeking a person with a genuine interest in these
questions.
The project will use state-of-the-art genomic and
eco-evolutionary data from a unique house sparrow
(Passer domesticus) model system in Norway. Multi-
generational data from natural and experimental (i.e.
articial selection and <common garden >) populations
in the wild is available. Phenotypic data include individ-
ual measurements of morphology, physiology (metabolic
rate), behavior, and life-history traits such as breed-
ing phenology, reproductive success and lifespan. The
genomic data consists of 200K SNP genotypes for hun-
dreds of individuals in both natural and experimental
populations.

The Renner Lab is seeking graduate students (Master's
and/or Joint-Doctoral PhD Positions) to join the Evolu-
tionary Biology Program at San Diego State University
in Fall 2016.
The Renner Lab examines evolutionary patterns and
processes that drive functional diversication. We are
particularly interested in how multi-species interactions
shape biodiversity at the microevolutionary scale and
inuence form and function. Our lab takes an inte-
grative approach in studying adaptation by combining
next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and phylo-
genetics with applied molecular biology.
Research topics we are currently investigating: - Gene
co-option and the molecular diversity of enzymes in-
volved in plant carnivory/defense response. - Plant
form and function, including morphological adaptations
for insect capture. - Evolutionary mechanisms behind
insect defense, host preference and detection.
More information about current projects can be found
on our lab webpage:

Ph.D. or M.Sc.: long-term eects of early development
in bighorn sheep
Parental investment theory assumes that parental care
has long-term tness consequences, but few of its predic-
tions have been tested with empirical data in long-livedspecies. In sexually dimorphic mammals, resource abun-
dance during early development, including maternal
care, is expected to have a stronger eect on the tness
of males than of females, but these eects should weaken
with increasing age. Does maternal care only aect early
development and survival, or does its signal persist also
in later growth, secondary sexual characters, and re-
productive success? Selective mortality likely removes
some of the early variation in development, but how
much and how? Do these eects interact with weather
and population density? Can the sources of variation
(environment, maternal care, genetics) be quantied,
and do they interact? The student will have access to 45
years of individual-based data and a deep pedigree for a
population of bighorn sheep, with more than 10,000 cap-
tures of over 1000 individuals and lifetime reproductive
success data for 25 cohorts. The program will involve
2-3 summers of data collection in Alberta. Candidates
should have a strong interest in evolutionary ecology,
knowledge of the behavioral ecology literature, statis-
tical skills, strong motivation to do original research,
and an ability to work in a remote eld setting with
limited personal space. The program can start in Jan-
uary or May 2016. The Universit e de Sherbrooke is a
francophone institution, therefore either some knowl-
edge of French or an interest in learning it are essential.
An internal scholarship of C$ 17,500 (M.Sc.) or C$
19,000 (Ph.D.) per year is available. The program will
be co-supervised by Fanie Pelletier. Although the re-
search is fully funded, external scholarship holders will
be preferred.
If you are interested, please e-mail me a CV, a letter
explaining why you want to do this research and the
e-mails of 2 people able to assess your potential as a

for resistance to Fusarium and Gaeumannomyces
This studentship (ESR8) is part of an EU training pro-
gramme called CerealPath that oers a total of 15 stu-
dentships and an exciting and diverse range of training
experiences http://cerealpath.eu/opportunities/early-
stage-researcher-opportunities/ Overview Research will
focus on the isolation and characterisation of novel fun-
gal endophytes from the wild relatives of barley and
wheat for resistance to the fungal pathogens Fusarium
and Gaeumannomyces. There are immediate areas of
research and training which will be critical in deter-
mining the usefulness of these and other endophytes as
inoculants for eld crops. This includes investigations
into how best to develop a commercial product, the
maintenance or loss of fungal competence over time, the
most eective inoculant delivery methods, and deter-
mination if they can oer a safe and viable economic
alternative or supplement to traditional chemical crop
treatments.
Objectives The objective of this project will be to train
ESR8 to screen wild relatives of barley and wheat in
NW Europe (partner countries) for novel endophytes
and to evaluate their impact on disease resistance, mode
of action and potential for commercial application.
Research Aliation and Supervision This project will be
based at Trinity College Dublin and the researcher will
be a registered Doctoral candidate at Trinity College
Dublin. The project will be carried out under the prin-cipal supervision of Professor Trevor Hodkinson, with
input from Mr Donal Fitzgerald (Goldcrop), Professor
James Brown and Dr Hans Jorgensen (UCPH), Dr Birgit
Jensen, Professor David Collinge and Mr Brian Murphy
(Trinity College Dublin).
Secondment Details This project will involve a research
secondment of 2 months at University College Dublin ,
to examine endophyte isolation, a further 2 months at
Kobenhavns Universitet, to work with ESR6 to deter-

UCalgary AdaptationGenomics
GRADUATE STUDENT positions at the UNIVER-

Local adaptation and the architecture of complex traits:
Theory and bioinformatics Sam Yeaman AIHS Chair in
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
I'd like to take this opportunity to invite prospective
graduate students (M.Sc. or Ph.D.) to apply for posi-
tions in my lab in the Department of Biological Sciences
at the University of Calgary. I am looking for candi-
dates interested in using theory, computer simulations,
and bioinformatic approaches to study the evolution of
genomic signatures of adaptation, and how the genome
itself may evolve in response to the problem of local
adaptation. I am also broadly interested in how evolu-
tionary analysis of genome sequence data can be applied
to problems in human health. The most important pre-
requisites for this position are curiousity and intelligence
{ I am happy to work with students from mathemati-
cal, computer sciences, or biology backgrounds, as your
graduate studies should be a time to learn new skills.
I have a range of potential projects that you could work
on (see below), or I would be happy to support your own
ideas, provided they broadly align with the interests of
the lab.
Graduate student positions include full funding
($21K/year) through a combination of lab-supported
stipends and TA-ships oered through the University ofCalgary. Of course, I encourage students to nd their
own funding (e.g., NSERC, AIHS, etc.), and will oer a
small research budget or additional stipend to students
that come with funding of their own. I will also provide
funding to attend one academic conference per year.
QUALITY OF LIFE: The University of Calgary is a vi-
brant and rapidly growing community, with over 22,000
undergraduate and 5,000 postgraduate students. Cal-
gary has some beautiful mountains nearby { the foothills
of the Rockies are only a 45 minute drive away. Calgary
has been rated 5th worldwide in the EIU's 2015 Live-
ability Ranking. My lab emphasizes a healthy approach
to work-life balance, as some of the best ideas seem to
come when you least expect them and life is too short
to focus on one thing alone.
TO APPLY: Please send a CV and a short description
of your interests to samuel.yeaman@ucalgary.ca, along
with the names and emails of three people I could con-
tact for reference letters. The deadline for a January
start date is September 15th, but later start dates are
ne too.

POTENTIAL RESEARCH PROJECTS:
1) Bionformatic detection of signatures of local adapta-
tion
There are many ways to study the genome and we are
only scratching the surface with current statistical tools
to study local adaptation. Furthremore, many of these
approaches seem to generate a large proportion of false
positives and negatives. There are many other possible
approaches, using haplotype information, linkage dise-
quilibrium, and comparative genomic data that could
be leveraged to improve our ability to study adapta-
tion. Development and testing of new tools on existing
datasets is critical to moving forward with our study of
population and comparative genomics, and with appli-
cations in health and environment.
2) Theoretical exploration of the eect of demography
and environment on genomic signatures of local adapta-
tion
Theory has shown that migration-selection balance can
shape the architecture of local adaptation, but testing
this theory using genomic data remains a major chal-
lenge. The aim of this project is to extend existing
theory to make explicit predictions about the eect of
realistic demographies and environments on genomic
signatures of local adaptation. This work will use in-
dividual based simulations to explore these ideas and
the development of new statistical tools to describe the
patterns we nd.38 EvolDir October 1, 2015
3) Factors aecting the rate of turnover in transient
genetic architectures
I recently published a paper that showed that with
highly polygenic traits, there can be rapid turnover in
the alleles that contribute to local adaptation, which can
be very dicult to detect in an empirical context (Am-
Nat 2015: Local adaptation by alleles of small eect). It
is unclear how the balance between migration, selection,
mutation, and drift shapes the rate of turnover in these
transient architectures, and this is an area worthy of
much more study.
4) Evolution of genomic rearrangements under spatial
+ temporal heterogeneity
Previous theory has shown that clusters of locally adap-
tive genes can evolve through genomic rearrangements
when environments are spatially heterogeneous (Yea-
man 2013; PNAS). The addition of temporal hetero-
geneity to these models results in very dierent archi-
tectures: sometimes architectures evolve where some
loci are highly clustered (as a response to spatial hetero-
geneity) and others are highly dispersed (presumably
in response to temporal heterogeneity). More work is
needed to understand how more complex environments
will aect our predictions

with prof. Emmanuel Milot, University of Que-
bec, Trois-Rivieres (Quebec, Canada) (www.uqtr.ca/-
emmanuel.milot/EN)
Starting as soon as possible. Please send the requested
documents to emmanuel.milot@uqtr.ca before October
27, 2015.
DESCRIPTION
MSc candidates are sought to work on projects within
the framework of the research program \The role of con-
temporary evolution in shaping life history, demography
and the fate of functional genetic variation in natural
populations". This program, funded by the Natural
Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC),
aims to study the process of selection and genetic change,
generation-by-generation, and to test life-history theory
using human populations as models. Recently, our team
documented the rst known example of microevolution
in a modern human population (Milot et al. 2011 PNAS
108, 17040-17045). The projects oered here will build
on this work.
Successful candidates will perform research in evolution-
ary genetics of life-history traits in replicate populations,
in eco-evolutionary dynamics across a ~250 year win-
dow, as well as on the consequences of evolution on
functional genetic variants, such as those involved in ge-
netic diseases (depending on the specic project). Can-
didates will have the chance to work with exceptional
data (pedigree and/or molecular data) from the Qu ebecpopulation, which has become a world-wide recognized
model in population genetics.
The students will join an interuniversity team in evolu-
tionary biology that will provide them with opportuni-
ties to interact and collaborate with researchers from
various disciplines (ecology, evolutionary ecology, epi-
demiology, anthropology, demography, genetic medicine,
etc.).
FUNDING Salary is available up to 2 years per project.
Candidates with proles good enough to apply for schol-
arships will be given priority.
CONDITION FOR ADMISSION
Candidates must have an undergraduate (bachelor ^A1s)
degree in biology or in a related domain, or expect to
have completed their degree very soon.
COMPETENCE SOUGHT All projects will involve
working with genealogical data, tting complex statisti-
cal models and performing simulations. The following
skills/aspects will be considered assets: having a basis
in population genetics; showing a strong interest to work
with complex statistics; having experience in program-
ming or being highly motivated to develop skills in that
eld; being rigorous and having good skills in writing.
Some knowledge of French (or willingness to learn it)
will help the students with their integration to the team
and the courses oered in the Master programs.

many people also speak English. Founded in 1634, Trois-
Rivi eres is the third oldest city in North America (after
Qu ebec City and Boston) with a small and nice old
downtown. It is strategically located within an hour
and half drive of Montreal and Qu ebec City, along the
St. Lawrence River and nearby vast forested landscapes.
Access is thus easy to both the great cultural life of
these cities and profuse outdoor activities, including
winter sports.

SocialEvolutionSexualSelection
PhD projects available in Celine Frere's Lab around the
themes of social evolution and sexual selection using
the eastern water dragon as an empirical study system.
In my lab, we use longitudinal life-history datasets on
wild populations comprising behavioural, spatial and
genetic information to answer questions about evolution-
ary processes. In particular, we aim to shed light on how
environmental and social factors inuence evolutionary
processes. We recently published a paper that showed
that female water dragons are polyandrous and male
reproductive success seems to be bias towards more het-
erozygous males. Multiple mating in female animals is
something of a paradox because it can either be risky
(e.g., higher probability of disease transmission, social
costs) or provide substantial tness benets (e.g., ge-
netic bet hedging whereby the likelihood of reproductive
failure is lowered). In this context, I am interested to
investigate (1) whether females manipulate their social
environment to maximise the genetic benets of their
ospring.
On the other hand, males display alternative mating
tactics (ARTs), switching between either aggressively de-
fending a territory or adopting satellite behavior. Here,
I am interested to investigate (2) the extent to which
ARTs inuence reproductive outcomes for males.
The study site is found within the Roma Street Park-
land (RSP) (27 27' 46\ S, 153 1' 11" E) located in
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. RSP is a 16 hectare
park and is the world's largest subtropical garden in
a city centre. It is also host to a large population
of Eastern water dragons with a population size esti-
mated to exceed 600 animals (Gardnier et al. PloS
ONE doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096992). Ecological,
behavioural surveys have been conducted on this popu-
lation since October 2010 with morphological and DNA
samples collected from more than 350 animals. The
student will be based in the Centre for Animal Health
Innovation at the University of the Sunshine Coast,
Queensland, Australia. The student should be interested
in combining behaviour, ecology and genetics. Please
visit www.celinefrerelab.com for more information.
Applicants will need to have an extremely competitive
academic record and obtain an Australian Postgradu-
ate Award or International Research and Fee Remis-sion Scholarships (for details and scholarship applica-
tion forms http://www.usc.edu.au/research/research-
students/hdr-scholarships). The main application dead-

There seems to be increased interest in the notion that
evolutionary history is worthy of management and con-
servation (see, e.g. Frishko et al. 2014; Diniz-Filho et
al. 2013). The basic quantity seems to be \phylogenetic
diversity" (PD) or the sum of the edge lengths connect-
ing a candidate set of species (Faith 1992). Given a
tree or network, one can produce many measures of
current (or expected) (contributions to) PD, and these
can be modied by other axes of value and expected
costs and benets of interventions. The technical side of
the eld seems to me to be in some disarray; there are
overlapping terms and denitions, weak connections to
other literatures (particularly community ecology), and
under-tested assumptions. My presentation will oer
little or no new data, but I will draw on the work of
others in an attempt to partially organize the techni-
cal side of the eld as I see it. Key issues concerning
mapping traits and geographic scale are taken up in the
following two presentations in this series.

Physiological and Biochemical Zoology is soliciting
manuscripts for review for a Focused Issue on:
Early-life Eects on the Adult Phenotype: a Compara-
tive Perspective
Adult organisms are the result of ontogenetic develop-
ment that is fundamentally guided by the genome, but
is also modulated by environmental factors. In general,
environmental inuences early in life are particularly
likely to have lasting eects, and yet are often dicult to
identify. For example, numerous studies show that hu-
mans that experience nutritional stress early in life (e.g.,
around conception) have altered adult phenotypes at
both behavioral and physiological levels. Further stud-
ies, especially with rodents, show that these eects may
have an epigenetic basis, caused by such mechanisms
as methylation of particular DNA sequences. Moreover,
work on rodents, shes, and insects demonstrate that
some early-life eects may cross generations (e.g., grand-
ospring may be impacted). Hence, early-life eects
may alter the nature of individual phenotypic variation
on which selection may act, as well as the proportion
of that variance that can contribute to a response to
selection.
Topics of interest for the focused issue include, but are
not limited to:
- Parental eects - Developmental plasticity and critical
windows - Acclimation and acclimatization - Eects of
altered biophysical conditions (e.g., hypoxia, environ-
mental acidication, climate change) during embryonic
stages on subsequent development, growth, and perfor-
mance - Epigenetic mechanisms underlying early-life
eects on adult phenotypes - Impact of parental stress
on development (including in utero & other maternal
eects) - Compensatory mechanisms of developing phys-
iological systems - Role of the endocrine system in early-
life eects - Long-lasting eects of toxicants experienced
during early life - Evolutionary consequences of earl-life
eects
Empirical studies should be hypothesis-driven and ex-
amine the ontogeny of behavior, morphology, physiology
or biochemical function. Studies on model organisms
as well as non-traditional species and humans are wel-
comed, but all submissions must oer insights relevant

SMBE proposals 2019
SMBE is accepting proposals to host its International
Meeting in 2019. The meeting is usually held in June or
July and attracts up to 1500 scientists from throughout
the world. For 2019, the Society will accept proposals
from Europe or North America, with a slight prefer-
ence for Europe, because the next three meetings will
be held in Gold Coast, Australia (2016), Austin, USA
(2017), and Yokohama, Japan (2018), respectively. The
successful location will need to have a lecture venue of
sucient size to host plenary lectures for all attendees
as well as smaller rooms for contributed papers, and
space for poster sessions. It will also need to be near
housing, preferably with a wide variety of options.
The proposals will come from a local organizing com-
mittee of scientists headed by an SMBE member. (We
are not interested in hearing from conference organizing
rms). Once a location is chosen, the local planning
committee will be responsible for the academic program.
The Society provides nancial support to underwrite the
hiring by the local organizers of a professional rm who
will help secure facilities, develop a website and advertise
the meeting. Guidelines for meeting organization are
posted on the Society's website https://www.smbe.org/-
smbe/MEETINGS/ConferenceGuidelines.aspx This is
a unique opportunity to host a premier international
meeting near your institution. If you are interested in
hosting or have questions about the meeting, please
address your enquires to SMBE President-Elect George
Zhang (Jianzhi@umich.edu) by Oct. 15, 2015. At this
stage, we are interested in preliminary inquiries and are
not insisting on complete plans.

For all other countries, the old license agreement re-
mains valid. USA has already been excluded from using
Treender in February 2015. This is all in accordance
with the license agreement stated in the TREEFINDER
manual since the earliest versions, which reserves me
the right to change the license agreement at any time.
I can do this because Treender is my own property.
On the TREEFINDER download website I have col-
lected many links to background information, including
some in English language.
I will check who is using Treender and I may sue the
license violators. I will, however, make exceptions for
political friends. Those who feel they are shall ask me.

Thaumetopoeinae samples
Dear Evoldir Members,
I am Andrea Basso and I am a PhD student working
at DAFNAE-Entomology, University of Padua, Italy.
In my PhD project, I am working with a subfamily of
moths called Thaumetopoeinae (Lepidoptera: Notodon-
tidae) trying to dene phylogenetic relationships in this
taxon using morphological and molecular traits.
Thaumetopoeinae are distributed in Europe, Africa, In-
dia and Australia with a wide number of species.
For my project I need some specimens of each species
(any number is welcome, no matter if they are larvae or
adults). At this moment I am working only on morpho-
logical traits from dried specimens preserved in several
museums but I need fresh specimens to extract DNA.
I am writing you because I would like to ask if the
EvolDir community could help me in collecting speci-
mens from the areas described below. I would need spec-
imens of: - Anaphe, Epanaphe, Hypsoides, Paradrallia,
Adrallia genera from Central to South Africa - Gaza-
lina genus from North West to North East of India,
Nepal, Buthan and Myanmar - Thaumetopoea apologet-
ica from South to Central-East Africa - Thaumetopoea
jordana and T.libanotica from middle East (Jordan
and Lebanon) - Thaumetopoea dhofarensis from Dhofar
(Oman province) - Thaumetopoea cheela from North
of Pakistan and North West of India - Thaumetopoea
ispartaensis sedirica, and torosica from Turkey (Isparta
and Adana provinces) - Epicoma, Tanystola, Aglaosomagenera from Australia The collection process is simple:
It is only necessary take a photo of specimens, write
down the location and to put them on a tube with ab-
solute ethanol to preserve DNA. Then you can send me
an email to have more details about the delivery. If
necessary, I can provide the tubes with alcohol.
Please contact me at andrea.basso.8@studenti.unipd.it
for other information like host plants and possible col-
lection sites or simply if you would like to know how to
identify these moths or if you just want to know more
about the project.
Thank you for considering my request.

One internship position focusing on adaptive evolution,
phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic of aphids is avail-
able at the Evolution et Diversit e Biologique (EDB)
laboratory in the group of Dr. Jean-Louis Hemptinne
at the University of Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier (France).
The student will work under the supervision of Jean-
Louis Hemptinne, Etienne Danchin, and Arnaud Sentis.
*Topic:*
Little is known about the importance of phenotypic plas-
ticity and epigenetic mechanisms for species adaptation
and evolution in the light of their paramount role for
species survival and interactions, and for ecosystem func-
tioning, crops yields and control of agricultural pests.
The successful candidate will thus perform a transgen-
erational evolution experiment on aphid and their lady-
beetle predator specically focused on transgenerational
non-genetic responses to biotic (i.e. predators) and abi-
otic (i.e. warming) stressors to better understand mech-
anisms of non-genetic inheritance for adaptive evolution
and improve biological control of aphid pests under
climate change. This includes routine maintenance of
aphid colonies and conducting laboratory experiments,
collecting data, and statistical analyses.

*Call for applications for a 2 years Postdoctoral Fel-
lowship on \Evolution of genomes in the genus /Rosa/"
at the Research Institute in Horticulture and Seeds
(Angers, France)*
//
A two-year postdoctoral researcher position is
available at the University of Angers (France).
The project is a collaboration between the \Re-
search Institute of Horticulture and Seeds" in
Angers, astride two teams \Genetics and Diver-
sity of Ornamentals" (GDO, http://www6.angers-
nantes.inra.fr/irhs eng/Research/GDO) and \Bioinfor-
matics" (BioInfo, http://www6.angers-nantes.inra.fr/-
irhseng/Research/BioInfo), and the group of Pr
Thomas Debener from the \Institute for Plant Genetics"
at the Leibniz University of Hannover (Germany; http:/-
/www.genetik.uni-hannover.de/index.html?&L=1). The
project will be a bio-informatic analysis of the evolution
of genomes in the genus /Rosa/, at two levels: (/i/)
the research of structural variants (SVs), and (/ii/) the
study of the evolution of resistance gene families (see
details below). Applications are open for candidates
who spent their two last work years abroad France,
and preferentially for non-French candidates. The net
salary (after taxes) is 2409.58 euro/month. The oppor-
tunity to apply for AgreenSkills programmes (https://-
www.agreenskills.eu/) may allow to increase this salary.
The beginning of the contract is expected for March orApril 2016. The postdoctoral researcher will be based in
Angers, regularly cited as the most pleasant city to live
in France, and at proximity to the Loire Valley. Travels
are planned between Angers and Hanover.
*Summary of the project: *The rose bush is the most
economically important ornamental plant and the model
plant for many studies about ornamental traits (ow-
ering, fragrance, disease resistance). The rose bush,
constituting the genus /Rosa/, has a complex evolution-
ary history with interspecic hybridization events and
polyploidizations. Little information about these events
is presently available, mainly hypotheses drawn from
sparse molecular markers. Recently, as part of an inter-
national consortium, co-coordinated by the GDO team,
the rst version of the genome sequence of a variety of
rose (/Rosa chinensis/ cv. 'Old Blush') has been ob-
tained. In this genomic context, we propose to study the
evolutionary history of the genus /Rosa/ by resequenc-
ing dierent species of the genus /Rosa/. *The objective
is to understand the evolution of genomes in the genus
/Rosa/*, and especially to focus on the processes that
led to the creation of wild species, including polyploid
ones, which are at the base of cultivated modern roses.
From short reads (paired-end) obtained from dierent
representative /Rosa/ species involved in cultivated rose
breeding, (/i/) the research of structural variants (SVs
as insertions, deletions, duplications, inversion, translo-
cations ^A), and (/ii/) the study of the evolution of
resistance gene families will be conducted.
//
*Mission of the postdoctoral fel-
low*://The//production of raw reads will be
done before the postdoc arrival. The hired postdoc
with a strong background in bioinformatics or genome
analysis will make a survey of the best methods to ana-October 1, 2015 EvolDir 105
lyze structural variations in rose genomes. He/she//will
then be in charge of the computer bio-analyses to
research the structural variants and to study gene
family evolution.
*Expected skills: *The desired applicant is expected
to be a bioinformatician or a bioanalyst with an exper-
tise in genome assembly. Expertise in the detection of
genomic rearrangements, identication of homologous
relations within gene family and/or gene family evolu-
tion study would be appreciated. Programming skills
for one or several languages are needed. Social skills are
also important for the success of interactions.
Applications should be sent by email
to jeremy.clotault@univ-angers.fr, fab-
rice.foucher@angers.inra.fr, debener@genetik.uni-
hannover.de and include a letter of motivation, a CV,
and names and contact information of three referees.

Post-doc position in computational genomics/gene reg-
ulatory networks
A post-doctoral position is available in the
group of Prof. Erik van Nimwegen (http://-
www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/groups-platforms/-
overview/unit/nimwegen/) at the Biozentrum of the
University of Basel and Swiss Institute of Bioinformat-
ics. We are looking for highly motivated individuals
with strong mathematical and computational skills
that are interested to perform theoretical research
in computational genomics, genome-wide regulatory
networks, and stochastic gene regulation in single cells.
Our research group is highly interdisciplinary, involv-
ing both an experimental section where researchers
with a background in molecular biology are experimen-
tally studying genome evolution and gene regulation
at the single cell level in bacteria, and a theoretical
section where researchers with backgrounds in theoreti-
cal physics, computer science, and applied mathematics
are using techniques from Bayesian probability, evolu-
tionary theory, dynamical systems theory, and stochas-
tic processes, to study the function and evolution of
genome-wide regulatory networks in cells. We are par-
ticularly interested in uncovering the principles by which
genome-wide regulatory networks specify and maintaincell identity in multi-cellular organisms, how cells con-
trol and exploit the noise in gene regulatory processes,
and how gene regulation evolves. A list of our group ^As
publications can be found at https://scholar.google.ch/-
citations?user=N24KB1wAAAAJ . Our lab also takes
part in a number of collaborative projects within Switzer-
land including StoNets, which studies the ways in which
cells control and exploit stochasticity in gene regula-
tory networks, and BrainStemX, which studies the gene
regulatory networks underlying mammalian forebrain
development. For this position we are in particular
looking for candidates that are interested in developing
methods for the analysis of next-generation sequenc-
ing data, including RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and
ChIP-seq data. The precise topic of the research project
will be determined jointly with the candidate and can-
didates that display initiative and independence will be
given priority.
Candidates should have strong mathematical and com-
putational skills, and experience in such areas as stochas-
tic processes, dynamical systems theory, and Bayesian
statistics is a plus. Experience with next-generation
sequencing data is desirable but not strictly required.
Candidates do not necessarily have to have a biologi-
cal background but should have a strong desire to di-
rectly work with experimental biologists. The candi-
dates should have a good knowledge of English. German
is helpful but not necessary. The salary is generous and
is set according to the guidelines of the Swiss National
Science Foundation. The start date will be by mutual
arrangement.
Basel is a very international city and a center of life sci-
ence research, with over 900 life science research compa-
nies in the area, including Novartis and Roche. Several
other academic institutions are also in the city, includ-
ing the Friedrich Miescher Institute, the ETH Zurich
Biosystems Science and Engineering Department, and
the Swiss Tropical Institute. The city is less than 5km
from both France and Germany and an hour and a half
from the Swiss Alps.
To apply, please send a single pdf containing your appli-
cation letter, CV, and the names of two references to
erik.vannimwegen-at-unibas.ch Review of applications
will begin immediately.

We are seeking a post-doctoral fellow with an interest
in applied ecological and evolutionary genomics and
aquatic ecosystems to lead a project investigating the
use of metabarcoding to measure responses of freshwater
plankton communities to land-use disturbances.
This project is part of a larger federal government ge-
nomics initiative aimed at enabling genomics-based
biomonitoring and a better understanding of the ef-
fects of land-use related stressors on Canadian biodiver-
sity and ecosystems. The focus will be on using next
generation sequencing to estimate zooplankton and/or
phytoplankton biodiversity across a disturbance gradi-
ent in two Canadian freshwater ecosystems important
for salmon: the Fraser River Delta (Sockeye salmon)
and the Prince Edward Island river system (Atlantic
salmon). This will be done to meet two main objectives:
(1) develop a metabarcoding-based biomonitoring tool
for freshwater, salmon-bearing systems on both coasts
of Canada; and (2) to apply this tool across a land-
use disturbance gradient to understand relationships
between multiple stressors and biological communities
that support salmon via food web interactions.
This highly interdisciplinary project will involve eld
work, high throughput DNA sequencing (metabarcod-
ing), and extensive bioinformatic and statistical analyses
on large datasets.
The successful candidate will have a PhD in a rele-
vant area of ecology, evolution, and/or systematics and
will demonstrate analytical and/or bioinformatics skills.
Experience in the preparation of samples for NGS (Illu-
mina) and knowledge of aquatic systems and community
ecology are desirable. Candidates should demonstrate
a strong track record of publication; have strong orga-
nizational, written, and oral communication skills; and
be able to work both independently and as part of a
collaborative team.
This posting is anticipatory and candidate selection
needs to progress as soon as possible for administrative
reasons. The position is an NSERC Visiting Fellowship
(up to 3 years duration) starting no earlier than April
1, 2016, but interested and qualied candidates must
be registered into the system by November 1, 2015,
and nal notication of award must occur no later
than January, 2016. Applications from international
candidates will be accepted until NSERC's quotafor international fellows has been reached; hence
Canadians are also strongly encouraged to apply. For

ImmuneCellEvolution
Postdoctoral position to study molecular evolution and
phylogenetics of immune cells
Formatted version with links at http://-
matsen.fredhutch.org/general/2015/09/01/ab-
postdoc.html Our adaptive immune systems continually
update themselves to neutralize and destroy pathogens.
The receptor sequences of antibody-making B cells
undergo a Darwinian process of mutation and selection
which improves their binding to antigen. It is now
possible to sequence these B cell receptors (BCRs) in
high throughput, giving a profound new perspective
on how the immune system responds to infection.
Although the elements of B cell anity maturation
are the same as molecular evolution in other settings,
being based on recombination, point mutation, and
selection, there are a many important dierences.
These dierences, along with the volume of sequence
data available, bring new challenges for phylogenetics
and molecular evolution. The translational medical
consequences of improved methods will be signicant.
Improved methods will especially help in understanding
the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies
against HIV. The current best hope for an eectiveHIV vaccine is to try to elicit such antibodies, but in
order to do so we need to understand in detail how such
antibodies. However, the eective antibodies naturally
produced in adults require many years of mutation
from an unlikely starting point. Thus they will be
exceedingly dicult to elicit with a vaccine.
Fortunately, Julie Overbaugh's group here at the Fred
Hutch recently published a landmark paper, in which
they found broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-
positive infants. These antibodies mature in signicantly
less time than in adults. The maturation pathway of
these antibodies is not yet understood.
This open postdoc position is to develop new methods
for B cell receptor sequence analysis and apply them to
sequences from the Overbaugh lab infant study. Our
group is dedicated to bringing modern model-based
statistical molecular evolution and phylogenetics ap-
proaches to BCR sequence analysis that scale to large
data sets. Thus far we have developed means of doing
selection inference on B cell receptors, VDJ annotation
(in press, PLOS Comp Bio), and clonal family inference
(paper out soon). Having made progress in these arenas,
we are now starting to improve phylogenetic methods for
B cell receptors. We would like someone who is strong in
computational statistics and/or molecular evolution, but
who is motivated by and engaged with the underlying
biology. This project will involve signicant computer
programming and data analysis, but no wet lab work.
The methods-development part of this postdoc will be
joint with Trevor Bedford, Vladimir Minin, and Harlan
Robins, co-founder of Adaptive Biotechnologies.
The position will come with a competitive postdoc-level
salary with great benets for two years. There is some
possibility of extension. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Re-
search Center, home of about 190 faculty including three
Nobel laureates, is an independent, nonprot research
institution dedicated to the development and advance-
ment of biomedical research. The environment is lively
yet casual, with a strong emphasis on collaborative work.
The Center is housed in a lovely campus next to Lake
Union a short walk from downtown, and a slightly longer
walk from the University of Washington. Powerful com-
puting resources and a helpful IT sta await.
If you are interested in this position, please send Erick
some representative publications, code samples, and a
CV. If you are interested more in evolutionary dynamics

genetic structure and phylogeography of carob. Fieldcampaigns of sampling have started in 2015 and will
continue in 2016 and certainly in 2017. The Postdoc
will receive technical help for lab work and will work in
a team involved in several projects of phylogeography,
population genetics or genomic (IMBE - IDEA team).
Using these dierent sets of markers, the Postdoc will
analyze the diversity of this panel and conduct phylogeo-
graphical analyses under Bayesian coalescent methods.
He will possibly collaborate with microbiologists of the

Postdoc: Applied Evolutionary Biology
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Selsh genetic elements have been studied for over a
century, and as far back as the 1960s researchers became
interested in using the power of selsh genetic elements
to drive genes into pest species to suppress their im-
pacts (Gould et al. 2006). Until recently, the focus of
applied work was on naturally occurring elements. In
the past decade some progress was made on developing
synthetic elements that mimicked natural meiotic drive
and selective embryo-killing, but de-novo creation of a
gene-drive system in a pest species was elusive. With
the harnessing of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 system in
the past few years there has been a revolution brewing inthis eld (Esvelt et al. 2014, Oye et al. 2014). In March
2015 a pivotal article by Gantz and Bier (2015) came
out in Science on-line demonstrating a CRISPR-Cas9
construct in Drosophila with strong gene drive. This
proof of principle has gained much attention.
Prospects are good that very soon a single student could
engineer a system for driving deleterious or behavior
modifying genes into pest populations. Not everyone
is comfortable with these developments and there has
even been a call for a moratorium on certain experi-
ments. There are also concerns about nefarious use of
the technology.
The bottom-line is that progress in molecular biology is
ahead of the population genetic work needed to build
systems that are less risky but accomplish changes in
the public interest.
We have been funded by the NIH and the W. M. Keck
Foundation to conduct this kind of population genetic
research. Our focus has been on mosquitoes that trans-
mit dengue and malaria, but we are also interested in
other biological systems (There is hope that these self-
ish genetic elements can save endangered species like
Hawaiian honeycreepers and specic seabirds (Gould
2008, Esvelt et al. 2014).
The postdoc in this position will build a set of simple
to complex models to examine the expected dynamics
of gene drive systems in mosquitoes and other taxa.
The most detailed model that we have developed simu-
lates the population dynamics and population genetics
of Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, in a city on the
Amazon river, Iquitos, for which there are rich data sets
on both mosquito dynamics and dengue epidemiology
(e.g. Magori et al. 2009, Okamoto et al 2014). An
accompanying epidemiological model is currently under
development. The goals of two other postdocs in our
group are to expand the mosquito model and the hu-
man epidemiology model to encompass the entire city of
about 400,000 people. The postdoc in this new position
will collaborate with the other postdocs to use these
detailed models to test gene drive systems, but will also

PennsylvaniaStateU CoralGenomics
Postdoctoral Researcher - Coral Hybridization Genomics
The Baums lab at The Pennsylvania State University
is looking for a postdoc to work on coral hybridization
genomics, funded by the National Science Foundation.
The only widely accepted coral hybrid system consists
of the once dominant but now threatened Caribbean
species, Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata. In the
past, hybrid colonies originating from natural crosses
between elkhorn and staghorn corals were rare, and
evidence of hybrid reproduction was limited to infre-
quent matings with the staghorn coral. Recent eld
observations suggest that the hybrid is increasing and
its ecological role is changing throughout the Caribbean.
These hybrids appear to be less aected by the dis-
ease that led to the mass mortality of their parental
species in recent decades. Research will address how
the increase in hybridization and perhaps subsequent
introgression will aect the current ecological role and
the future evolutionary trajectory of Caribbean acrop-
orids. Applications must be submitted electronically at
https://psu.jobs/job/59676. The successful candidate
should have a strong background in bioinformatics with
experience in genome sequencing, assembly, admixture
mapping, SNP development and analysis. Program-
ming skills including UNIX/LINUX and R are required.
Experience with wild coral collections, coral spawn-
ing experiments, aquarium experiments on corals or
AAUS SCUBA certication is a plus. The candidate
must have a PhD in bioinformatics, evolution, marine
biology, molecular ecology or related elds. The candi-

StockholmNHM Palaeogenomics
Postdoctoral Position in Palaeogenomics Swedish Mu-
seum of Natural History
DESCRIPTION We are seeking a highly motivated post-
doctoral researcher to join the ancient DNA research
group at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (see
www.palaeogenetics.com/adna). The position is for two
years, and the postdoc is expected to play a key role
in our ongoing projects on population genomics of Late
Pleistocene fauna. The research will be focused on
computational analysis of NGS data obtained from mul-
tiple radiocarbon dated specimens dating back to last
glaciation. One of the primary goals of the project is to
investigate the extent to which pre-extinction changes in
demography have led to losses in genome-wide diversity
and increases in inbreeding coecients (see Palkopoulou
et al. 2015, Curr Biol). We are also interested in us-
ing palaeogenomic data to empirically investigate the
relationship between genetic drift in small populations
and accumulation of deleterious genetic variation. More-
over, additional questions that can be addressed includeidentication of genomic signatures of natural selection
across known changes in climate at the end of the last
ice age, as well as estimating mutation rates based on
time-stamped genomes and examining the timing of
divergence among populations (see Skoglund et al. 2015,
Curr Biol).
ENVIRONMENT The position will be based at the De-
partment of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (SMNH). The museum is
located in Stockholm, which by many is regarded as one
of the most beautiful capitals in the world and is home
to a vibrant scientic community with several leading
research institutes, including Stockholm University and
the Science for Life Laboratory. The SMNH has a strong
mission in natural history research, and its research di-
vision has more than 170 employees. The department of
Bioinformatics and Genetics hosts three research groups,
focused on ancient DNA and population genetics (PI:
Dr. Love Dal en), avian systematics and biogeography
(PI: Dr. Martin Irestedt), and phylogenomics (PI: Prof.
Fredrik Ronquist).
QUALIFICATIONS The ideal candidate is a creative
and independent researcher, who by the start of the
project has obtained a PhD in biology or a related eld.
A record of scientic achievement in bioinformatics and
computational genomics is essential, as is previous expe-
rience in handling NGS data using scripts and analysis
pipelines. Additional merits include experience in com-
puter programming, population genetics and wet lab
analyses, as well as prociency in genome assembly and
annotation.
START DATE The start date of the position is exible,
but should not start later than January 1, 2016. The
position is for two years full-time and employment will
either be as a Postdoc or Researcher, depending om
whether the applicant was awarded his/her PhD degree
less or more than three years before the application
deadline.
FURTHER QUESTIONS For further questions re-
garding the position, please contact Dr. Love Dal en
(love.dalen@nrm.se). Union representative is Bodil Ka-
jrup SACO-S. Both can be reached at telephone number

Postdoctoral position in Ethology at the Department
of Zoology at Stockholm University. Closing date 1
October 2015.
Project description
A fully funded 2-year post-doctoral position is available
at the Zoology Department (Ethology) at Stockholm
University. The candidate can chose to work within
either or both of two potential projects. For the rst
project, developed in collaboration with Dr Bj orn Rogell
at Stockholm University, we are looking for a person
with demonstrated experience in experiments using sh
as model system. This project involves work on the
eects of lifestyle on life history and behaviour using kil-
lish as a model system. Killish are an excellent model
system because of their strong contrasts in lifestyle:
some species live in temporary water bodies which com-
pletely dry out and only the eggs survive by going into
diapause (annual species), whereas other species live in
permanent water bodies and do not present diapause.
The dierent species thus present marked dierences
in longevity and other life history traits. We currently
have stocks of several annual and non-annual killish
species in the lab allowing the postdoctoral researcher
to develop diverse experiments analyzing the inuence

SwanseaU FishIntrogression
Postdoctoral position in Fish Epigenetic Introgression
at Swansea University
We are looking for 1 Postdoctoral Research Fellow to
explore the role of epigenetic modications in the in-
trogression between farm and wild salmon. It has long
been recognised that the introduction of Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar L.) from captive populations in the wild,
mainly through escapes from sh farms threaten the
genetic integrity of natural populations through genetic
introgression. Although domesticated salmon seem to
have in general poor reproductive success, farm mature
parr can have higher rates of fertilisation success than
their wild counterparts, acting as vehicles of introgres-
sion, and in fact gametes of farm salmon are functionally
similar to those of wild ones. Populations invaded by
farm escapes show signs of signicant genetic change
and interbreeding between farm and wild salmon result
in dierences in the gene expression associated with
environmental change and immune response. Yet, the
mechanisms regulating these changes remain unknown.
It has been recently documentation that sperm (but not
oocytes) epigenetic signatures are maintained in the in
the embryos of zebra sh, if this was conserved in other
sh the consequences of farm-wild introgression could
be more profound that previously thought. Epigenet-
ics mechanisms explain how heritable (and potentially
reversible) changes in gene expression can contribute
to phenotypic diversity in populations through mech-
anisms that do not alter the underlying genetic code.
This opens the door to a new potential vehicle of farm-
wild interactions: epigenetic introgression that could
further compromise locally adapted salmon populations.
This project will provide data to clarify whether rear-
ing in captivity can translate in epigenetic changes in
the sperm of A. salmon that can be maintained in the
embryo, representing a vehicle of introgression between
farm and wild populations.
The project is funded by BBSRC-NERC and the post
is available for 12 months stating November 2015 (al-
though there is certain exibility in the starting date)
and based in Swansea University (Dr Sonia Consuegra,
Prof Carlos Garcia de Leaniz) in collaboration with the
University of Highlands and Islands (Prof Eric Verspoor,Dr Mark Coulson). At Swansea the Fellow will join a
dynamic group (3 postdocs, 7 PhD students) working
on a range of topics in Evolutionary Ecology including
epigenetic basis of sh domestication, genetic and epige-
netic basis of disease resistance under inbreeding, novel
methods for detection of invasive species and modelling
of dispersal.

SyracuseU PlantEvolution
A post-doctoral position is available in the laboratory
of Jannice Friedman, in the Department of Biology at
Syracuse University. Work in our lab is focused on
the evolution of reproductive strategies in plants, and
understanding both the genetics and ecology of diver-
gent reproductive strategies. The advertised position is
for an NSF-funded project studying sexual selection in
plants with dierent mating and pollination systems.
The research focuses on the mechanisms of sexual se-
lection in plants. We are interested in the following
questions: Do females show choice for particular male
gametophytes, and does this vary with pollen load and
genetic identity of female and male gametophytes? Do
components of sexual selection dier for wind versusOctober 1, 2015 EvolDir 123
animal pollinated species, and outcrossing versus selng
species? The project will use an experimental approach
to investigate interactions between the growing pollen
tubes and stylar tissue and individual ovules. In addi-
tion the research will use a phylogenetic comparative
context to understand the strength and evolution of
sexual selection, by utilizing diversity in pollination and
mating system in the genus Thalictrum.
The Department of Biology at Syracuse University has
a strong concentration in evolutionary and plant eco-
logical research with opportunities for interaction and
collaboration. The Friedman Lab is part of the new
Center for Reproductive Evolution, with core strengths
in sexual selection and female/male interactions, span-
ning evolutionary genetics and genomics, proteomics
and behavioral evolution. Opportunities exist to de-
velop new research, and the successful candidate will be
encouraged to develop and pursue novel and exciting
questions. We are located in the recently built Life
Science Center, which includes modern lab, greenhouse
and computational facilities.
The position is available for 2 years, and will include
a competitive salary and full benets. The ideal start
date will be early 2016. Interested candidates should

on tness in the model alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
Peter Keightley's and Nick Colegrave's BBSRC-funded
project aims to understand the link between genotype
and phenotype, specically how random changes in the
genome aect quantitative traits and ultimately tness.
This research capitalises on over 100 fully sequenced
mutation accumulation lines of C. reinhardtii. The re-
search includes the molecular marker-based analysis of
recombinant mutation accumulation lines of C. rein-
hardtii to determine the distribution of tness eects of
individual mutations. In addition, we are seeking a can-
didate interested in applying methods in evolutionary
genomics to investigate the tness eects of mutations
in wild populations using whole-genome sequences of
individuals collected from nature.
Candidates should have or will shortly obtain a PhD or
equivalent in a relevant subject, as well as a proven abil-
ity in molecular genetics, particularly molecular marker
genotyping, and experience of the statistical analysis to
biological data.
Within the aims of the project there will be opportunity
to develop ideas relating to the impacts of mutation on
tness. The grant includes generous funding to attend
international conferences. The position is for 21 months
from 01/12/15.

POST-DOCTORAL POSITION IN EUKARYOTE
GENOME EVOLUTION
A two-year postdoctoral position is available in the re-
search group of professor Hanna Johannesson, at the
Evolutionary Biology Centre (EBC), Uppsala Univer-
sity.
State-of-the art sequencing technology has opened op-
portunities to comprehensively investigate structural
variants (SVs: such as deletions, insertions, duplica-
tions, inversions and translocations) in genomes of nat-
ural populations. Such SVs are often associated with
gene expression changes and may be of large phenotypic
eects. The main goal of this postdoc project is to
use sequencing data (e.g. PacBio long read sequence
data) for the model system Neurospora, emerging from
our most recent sequencing projects, to increase our
understanding of the impact of SVs for the evolution
of eukaryote genomes. In particular, we can use the
well-established phylogenetic framework of Neurospora
to study the accumulation of SVs over evolutionary
time, and connect them to characters such as genome
size expansion/retraction, mating-system transition and
speciation. By combining comparative genomic, phylo-
genetic and population genetic analyses, the evolution-
ary signicance of SVs in natural populations can be
traced. The project will be developed after the interest
of the applicant, but should encompass a perspective of
genome evolution addressed by bioinformatic/genomic
approaches.Applicants should have a PhD in biology/evolutionary
biology and have documented experience in bioinfor-
matics. Documented skills in comparative genomics,
molecular phylogenetics and/or population genetics is
highly valued.
Start date is exible, ideally January 1, 2016. The

We recommend that you chose a workshop close to your
city, thus saving time and travel cost. Read more about
the BioBash Workshops online at www.biobash.com,
where you can compare detailed agendas of the work-
shops to nd the right one for you.
Essentials+ is a 5-day bioinformatics workshop aimed
at life scientists with little or no knowledge of basic
bioinformatic skills. Common and general tools such
as Linux command line and regular expressions are
explained through practice, and more work is put into
building solid programming foundations in Python. The
participants learn how to tackle many everyday tasks
that come up regardless of their actual scientic ques-
tion, and how to automate repetitive activities such
as querying online databases or extracting information
from endless text les. Moreover, a full day introduction
into the NGS data analysis will be given, covering in
practice the logic behind the ltering, assembly and
mapping of short reads.
Essentials is a 3-day workshop designed for life scientists
who are starting to dive into data analysis. It will get
you the general tools that you will repeatedly require
regardless of your actual scientic question. Learn about
the Linux command line, tools used for NGS data anal-
ysis and get a one day primer into programming with
Python. Visit our website to learn more.
Python is also a 3-day workshop that will provide solid
foundations in the Python programming language. It is
aimed at life scientists with little or no programming ex-
perience and will start from the very basics. Gradually,many important building blocks will be introduced to
enable you to eciently design or adapt Python scripts
according to your needs. Your toolbox will be addi-
tionally expanded with BioPython, a module of diverse
bioinformatics functions to query online databases, ac-
cess NCBI BLAST and more. Learn how to automate
your repetitive tasks and boost your scientic produc-
tivity. Visit our website to learn more.

for established investigators, postdoctoral scholars, and
advanced graduate students. Scientists with strong
interests in the uses of genome-scale sequencing data
and the application of modern analysis tools to study
population dynamics and interactions are encouraged
to apply. Lectures and computer laboratories total ~90
hours of scheduled instruction. No prior programming
experience is required.
This independent workshop is also very suitable to be
used as a complement to the Workshop on Genomics,
which will take place just before the Workshop on Pop-
ulation and Speciation Genomics, at the same location.

tance Notication: October 30, 2015
Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) or
likelihood-free (LF) methods have developed mostly
beyond the radar of the machine learning community,
but are important tools for a large and diverse segment
of the scientic community. This is particularly true
for systems and population biology, computational
neuroscience, computer vision, healthcare sciences, but
also many others.
Interaction between the ABC and machine learning
community has recently started and contributed to im-
portant advances. In general, however, there is still
signicant room for more intense interaction and collab-
oration. Our workshop aims at being a place for this to
happen.
The workshop will consist of invited and contributed
talks, poster spotlights, and a poster session. Rather
than a panel discussion we will encourage open discus-
sion between the speakers and the audience.
Invited Speakers:Mark Beaumont University of Bristol Oksana Chkrebtii,

Submissions:
We invite submissions in NIPS 2015 format with a max-
imum of 4 pages, excluding references. Anonymity is
not required. Relevant works that have been recently
published or presented elsewhere are allowed, provided
that previous publications are explicitly acknowledged.
Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present
either a poster or a short talk. Please submit papers in

Overview Genome-Phenome analysis is both a challeng-
ing biological problem and a key component of precision
medicine. This course aims to introduce current meth-
ods and concepts used to link genomes and phenomes.
Emphasis will be placed on mapping disease suscepti-
bility genes. Course topics will be presented as lectures
each followed by illustrative practical sessions. Top-
ics will cover technological and design issues as well as
current data analysis and interpretation strategies.
A variety of approaches to Genome-Phenome analysis
will be covered ranging from array and targeted re-
sequencing of (Epi-)Genome-Wide Association Studies
to full genome re-sequencing. The main focus of this
course will be on complex traits, however, the genetic
architectures of cancer and rare diseases will also be
considered.
Methods: The course is comprised of practical exercises
preceded by short lectures. There will be opportunities
to hold group discussions on specic case studies.
Target Audiences: (1) Individuals with knowledge about
bioinformatics and/or genomics, that aim at using mod-
ern methods to address population variation or genotype
phenotype association studies. (2) Individuals interested
in some particular phenotype(s) (MDs, veterinarians,
biologists) and wishing to commence investigation of the
genetics of their trait(s) of interest. (3) All individuals,
graduate or professional, wishing to expand on their
working knowledge of the genetics of complex traits.
Pre-requisites: In addition to a reasonable level of com-
puter literacy, a minimal familiarity with the basics of
bioinformatics, statistics, genomics and biology will be
assumed.

EvolutionaryNetworks Jul3-9
Free summer school (July 3rd-9th 2016): Introduction
to the concepts and methods of networks in evolutionary
studies (sequence similarity networks, genome networks
and bipartite graphs)
The summer school is now extended to researchers.
It will be held in Rosco, France, between July 3rd 2016
(date of arrival) and July 9th (date of departure)(http:/-
/www.sb-rosco.fr/index.php).
This school is designed in priority for biologists and bio-
informaticians (completing a PhD degree, or currently
post-doctoral fellows, or researchers), who wish to learn
the bases of network analyses.
The main notions (regarding various types of networks,
the relevance of their analyses, and some bases in graph
theory) will be introduced by short theoretical classes,
followed by practical case-studies, introducing the basics
in programming required to run such network analyses
as well as to use the existing software/tools. Our goal
is that, by the end of this summer school, all applicants
will be qualied to perform network analyses of their
own datasets.
More precisely, we will focus on the following concepts
and methods:
- Introgressive evolution and large-scale diversity studies.
- Construction and analysis of sequence similarity net-
works (construction and sorting of connected compo-
nents, denition of gene families, search for composite
genes, implementation of centrality measures)
- Construction and analysis of genome networks (con-
struction of weighted genome networks, implementation
of their diameter, shortest paths, analyses of labeled
nodes, etc.)
- Construction and analysis of gene-genome bipartite
graphs (detection of connected components, and their
articulation points, and twins)
In addition, conferences on networks and evolution will
be delivered by leading scientists during this school.
Expected speakers feature: Fernando Baquero, Robert
Beiko, Marco Fondi, Michel Habib, Philippe Huneman,
Fran cois-Joseph Lapointe, Mattis List, Philippe Lopez,
and Marc-Andr e S elosse.October 1, 2015 EvolDir 147

Winter school Linking Community and Ecosystem Dy-
namics: rst announcement
The Research School Ecology & Evolution of the Gronin-
gen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES,
University of Groningen) is organizing a Winterschool
for PhD students and Postdocs on Linking Community
and Ecosystem Dynamics. The school will be held in
the University eld station 'Herdershut' on the Dutch
island of Schiermonnikoog from November 15 - 20 2015.
Scope of the course
The research elds community and ecosystem ecology
have diverged more or less independently over the last
decennia. Progress is made in understanding shifts in
community composition under the inuence of environ-
mental change and how these shifts can be explained
by functional trait approaches of component species.
Studies in ecosystem ecology traditionally have a strong
focus on energy and nutrient uxes and how deviationin these uxes aect ecosystem functioning and stability.
Recent studies reveal tight links between these sub-
disciplines that enforce us to rethink how communities
and ecosystems interact.
This course focuses on theoretical concepts such as auto-
catalytic loops and feedbacks between organisms, ther-
modynamics in species interactions and the importance
of ecosystem engineers. We will explore how these prin-
ciples can be used to link communities to ecosystems in
order to understand how environmental change aects
community and ecosystem dynamics.
Course lecturers include Prof. Neil Rooney (U. of
Guelph), Prof. Han Ol (U. of Groningen), Prof. Matty
Berg (Free University Amsterdam), Prof. Tjeerd Bouma
(Netherlands Institute for Sea Research).

StructuralEquationModelling
Dec14-18
We are pleased to announce a postgraduate course on
Structural Equation Modelling, organised by the Gradu-
ate School for Production Ecology and Resource Conser-
vation (PE&RC) of Wageningen University, Netherlands.
The course will take place from Monday 14 to Friday 18
December 2015 at Wageningen University Campus. This
course will be lectured by Professor Bill Shipley, who
is one of the leading international experts in the eld
of Path Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling.
Registration is now open at www.pe-rc.nl/sem! Scope:
While much of statistics focusses on associations between
variables and making predictions, the aim of structural
equation modelling is to establish causal relationships
between variables. In spite of the common belief that
any causal statement requires randomized experiments,
there is an increasing body of theory, methodology and
software which enables scientists to draw certain types
of causal conclusions from observational data. This has
important advantages, especially in cases where ran-domized experiments are not feasible. Notably, causal
models allow the quantication of intervention eects,
which is the response of the system given a certain value
of one your variables (e.g. gene knock-out, rainfall).
This new course will explain the key concepts under-
lying causal inference, the required assumptions, and
how the interpretation of results diers from the case of
randomized experiments. To ensure that you learn from
the best, we managed to get Prof. Bill Shipley from the
Universit ^A^A de Sherbrooke in Canada to come over to
Wageningen to actually give this course. Prof. Shipley
is the author of \Cause and correlation in biology: A
user^A^As guide to path analysis, structural equations,
and causal inference", which by many is seen as the
guide for working with Path Analysis and Structural
Equation Models. The focus will be on classical struc-
tural equation models with a small number of (latent)
variables, but we will also give an introduction to recent
developments on methodology for high-dimensional data.
Throughout the course we will discuss applications in
ecology, social sciences and genetics. Depending on the
background and interests of the participants we may
put a stronger emphasis on some of these applications.
Participants are therefore encouraged to bring their own
data.
Programme: Day 1: Introduction and background of
structural equation models (SEM): causation versus
correlation, causal inference versus classical statistics.
Identiability and estimation for models without latent
variables.
Day 2: Testing and selecting your model: goodness of t
tests, model comparison, conrmatory and explanatory
models.
Day 3: Adding latent (unmeasured) variables to your
model; concept of latent variables, estimating SEMs
with latent variables.
Day 4: The estimation of causal eects revisited: causal
graphs, directed acyclic graphs and conditional indepen-
dence, d-separation and faithfulness. The d-sep test.
Day 5: Applications of SEMs in ecology and genomics,
e.g. causal inference for high-dimensional data with the
R-packages pcalg and qtlnet.

Prior knowledge: Although the emphasis will be on the150 EvolDir October 1, 2015
concepts rather than mathematical properties, some
basic knowledge of probability and statistics will be re-
quired to understand those concepts. In particular, we
will assume familiarity with random variables, joint dis-
tributions of random variables, conditional distributions
and multiple regression. Basic knowledge of R is rec-
ommended (e.g. installing packages, reading data-les,
linear regression).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of theOctober 1, 2015 EvolDir 151
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
