International Symposium on Aquatic Vascular Plants:
25 Years After
On 11-14 January 2006, an International Symposium
on Aquatic Vascular Plants will be organized again at
the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 25 years after its ﬁrst
edition. The aim is to bring together aquatic plant
scientists and ecologists from all over the world, with
emphasis on the following topics:
? Molecular phylogeny and evolution
? Phylogeography and patterns of distribution
? Molecular ecology of populations
? Survival strategies, dispersal and establishment
? Autoecology and relationships with environment
? Vegetation analysis and remote sensing applications
? Biotic interactions and stable isotope applications
Original contributions on aquatic vascular plants from
freshwater, brackish water and coastal zones are wel-
comed. New insights using DNA, stable isotopes, re-
mote sensing, modeling etc. are envisaged
25 years ago on 23-25 January 1981, an International
Colloquium on Aquatic Vascular Plants was held in
Brussels. The aims of the colloquium were to provide
contact between botanists working on aquatic plants
to present a synthesis of their work and to deﬁne key
subjects in this ﬁeld of research. The colloquium was
attended by 140 plant scientists and ecologists from 15
countries and 70 presentations were scheduled. The
topics covered at that time were pollination mecha-
nisms, morphological variation and development, cy-
tology, photosynthesis, growth and reproductive strate-
gies, primary production, nutrient cycling, decompo-
sition, community analysis, distribution, conservation,
introductions and weeds. These contributions were
published in a much cited book Symoens J.J., Hooper
S. & Comp?re P. (Eds.) (1982) Studies on Aquatic Vas-
cular Plants. Royal Botanical Society of Belgium 424
pp.

Bergen EvolEcology
*** 1 PhD student position in evolutionary ecology in
Bergen, Norway ***
Position is available at the Institute of Marine Research
in Bergen, Norway, to develop and analyse eco-genetic
models of ﬁsheries-induced adaptive change. This mod-
elling framework aims at combining a realistic descrip-
tion of the ecological setting as well as population struc-
ture with a description of genetic detail at a level that
would still allow predictions on rate of evolutionary
change. Potential empirical interfaces include applica-
tions to cod, plaice, salmon and oysters.
The post is funded as part of a EU Marie Curie Re-
search Training Network FishACE (Fisheries-induced
Adaptive Change in Exploited Stocks). According to
fellowship rules (see http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/-
ADN/FishACE/Positions.html ), applicants must be of
non-Norwegian nationality and must not have resided
in Norway for more than 12 months in the last three
years [notice that Norwegian citizens and residents can
apply for positions in other teams in this network.]
Skills in life history theory, ecological and evolution-
ary modelling and an interest in ﬁsheries would be an
advantage. The work will be carried out in collabo-
ration with other teams in the network, facilitated by
short research visits.
FishACE ( http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/ADN/-FishACE/ ) is an EU Marie Curie Research Training
Network set up to investigate the prevalence and
consequences of ﬁsheries-induced adaptive changes in
exploited aquatic systems in European waters. The
network is coordinated by International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria.
There are altogether 11 network teams in 8 European
countries. Besides training through research, the
network provides tailored training courses on relevant
methods and skills.
Institute of Marine Research ( http://www.imr.no ) is a
national research centre aﬃliated with the Norwegian
Ministry of Coast and Fisheries. The institute conducts
research in the ﬁelds of marine environment, marine re-
sources, and aquaculture. IMR, in its area, is one of the
largest research institutes in the world, focusing on both
applied and fundamental marine research. The main of-
ﬁce of IMR is located in Bergen on the west coast of
Norway. Bergen is a lively town with rich cultural life,
and the surroundings oﬀer excellent opportunities for
all sorts of outdoor pursuits.
The PhD position is for 36 months. The fellow will
enrol as a PhD student at the Institute of Biology
in University of Bergen. Salary, which include travel
and mobility allowances, follows the rates prescribed
by EC and are competitive. Preferred starting date is
in autumn 2005. The review of applications will start
September 1 and continue until the positions are ﬁlled.

UCollegeDublin GenomicImprinting
PhD Studentship
Evolution of a complex receptor and of genomic im-
printing
A three-year PhD Studentship, funded by Science
Foundation Ireland and commencing in September
2005, is available in the Zoology Department, Univer-
sity College Dublin, Ireland (Catherine M. (aka Kay)
Nolan’s lab). The research will investigate the cell and
molecular biology of the cation-independent mannose 6-
phosphate receptor (CI-MPR), also known as the IGF2
receptor (IGF2R). The overall goal of the study is to
understand the evolution of this complex receptor and
in particular the factors that may have contributed to
the evolution of its imprinted status in mammals.
The project will focus on the zebraﬁsh, Danio rerio,
and the dog, Canis familiaris, and is part of an ongo-
ing collaboration between the Nolan lab in UCD and
Dr Lucy Byrnes (Biochemistry Dept, NUI Galway, Ire-
land) and Prof. Bass Hassan (Dept of Pathology and
Microbiology, School of Medical Sciences, Bristol, UK).
The student employed will also spend some time in the
collaborating laboratories.
The studentship will provide a stipend and full pay-
ment of fees (for a candidate of EU origin). Candidates

UHelsinki TrophicLevels
POST GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP: MULTI-
TROPHIC INTERACTIONS IN SPACE
How do species at diﬀerent trophic levels interact with
each other, how are these interactions modiﬁed by the
spatial setting, and how do spatial eﬀects then re-
ﬂect into rates of functional processes? If these ques-
tions interest you, you are invited to apply for a three-
year post graduate fellowship, available from September
2005 onwards in the Metapopulation Research Group
(www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop ) at the University of
Helsinki, Finland. The monthly salary is ca. 1900 EUR
and your supervisor will be Tomas Roslin.
The PhD project is aimed at analyzing how herbivorous
insects on the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) interact
with trophic levels above and below them in a quan-
titative manner. Our target taxa encompass the oak
and its microlepidoptera, gallwasps, their parasitoids
(largely Hymenoptera) and the oak mildew fungus. The
project has a strong empirical focus, but allows for in-
teraction with several theoretically-minded members of
a broader research group. Finnish PhD projects typi-
cally last for four years: hence, the successful candidate
should dedicate him-/herself to this project until 2009.
Some experience with identifying insects in general, and
parasitic Hymenoptera in particular, will be regardedSeptember 1, 2005 EvolDir 9
as a major advantage (but by no means as a prereq-
uisite for applying). You will also need a strong will
to learn and to experiment with new techniques, since
your work will involve a range of target organisms stud-
ied both under ﬁeld and laboratory conditions.
Applications including a short CV and two let-
ters of recommendation should be submitted by 15
September 2005 to Dr. Tomas Roslin by email,
tomas.roslin@helsinki.ﬁ. Please ask your referees to
send their letters directly to this address, not to your-
self.

MARIE CURIE TRAINING FELLOWSHIP IN
BIOINFORMATICS
Background: Applications are invited from PhD stu-
dents across Europe to spend up to 12 months un-
dertaking research at the Marie Curie Site for Bioin-
formatics Education and Research at the University
of Manchester. Details on this training site can
be found at: http://mc-opportunities.cordis.lu/show-
PRJ.cfm?obj id=836
Project Title: Marie Curie Training Site for Bioinfor-
matics, Education and Research
Job Title: Marie Curie Fellow to work on compara-
tive genomics and bioinformatics of noncoding DNA
sequences.
Project details: A vacancy is available to work on the
development and application of methods to analyse the
function and evolution of non-protein-coding DNA se-
quences in genome sequences, with a special emphasis
on the cis-regulatory elements that control transcrip-
tion in eukaryotes. It is now well appreciated that
the vast majority of DNA in the genome sequences of
higher eukaryotes is non-protein-coding, yet the func-
tion of this noncoding DNA remains largely unknown.
An explosion of data and methods are now available
to identify functional elements in noncoding sequences,many involving comparative approaches. This vacancy
will use comparative genomic data in model organisms
(yeast, ﬂies, worms, and/or mammals) to identify signa-
tures of noncoding sequence evolution that are charac-
teristic of cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and
enhancers, capitalizing on experience and resources de-
veloped in Drosophila (Bergman et al. Genome Biology
2002; Bergman et al. Bioinformatics 2005). Success-
ful applicants will contribute to the overall objective of
the group to develop predictive models of cis-regulatory
sequences using comparative data, but other project
proposals will be considered. Projects will be tailored
to the experience and objectives of the applicant and
can combine data analysis, text mining, development
and/or evaluation of methods.
The project is for 3-12 months and will be under the su-
pervision of Dr. Casey Bergman in the Faculty of Life
Sciences at the University of Manchester. Applicants
should have a background in biology or computer sci-
ence, ideally with experience of large-scale data analysis
and/or modeling techniques and programming experi-
ence in PERL or JAVA. Trainees will be given com-
plementary training in genome informatics, compara-
tive genomics and data-mining and be able to interact
with bioinformatics and wet-lab groups in the Faculty
working in ﬁeld of gene expression. For further de-
tails, please contact casey.bergman@manchester.ac.uk

Doctoral position available in Evolutionary Biology and
Biodiversity in the Zoological Museum at the Univer-
sity of Zurich in Switzerland
The research group in Evolutionary Biology and
Biodiversity led by Professor Tony Wilson in
the Zoological Museum ( <http://www.unizh.ch/-
zoolmus >www.unizh.ch/zoolmus ) is seeking a well-
qualiﬁed and highly motivated doctoral candidate for
a position at the University of Zurich. The position is
for three years, beginning in November 2005 and with
a salary of ca. 40,000 Swiss Francs. A Masters degree
(or equivalent) is a prerequisite for acceptance into the
Ph.D. program at the University of Z¨ urich.
Our group concentrates on the role of sexual selec-
tion and environmental variation in the speciation pro-
cess. Integrating molecular phylogenetic, population
genetic and functional genomic approaches, our work
spans a broad temporal scale in an eﬀort to derive
testable hypotheses on the evolution of taxonomic di-
versity. Over the past several years, our research
has concentrated on syngnathid ﬁshes (seahorses and
pipeﬁsh), a group of particular interest due to spe-
cialized morphological adaptations for male parental
care and female-dominated competition for access to
mates. Our work involves ongoing collaborations with
researchers in America, Europe and Australia.
We have recently installed three 5000L climate-
controlled aquarium facilities, oﬀering unparalleled op-
portunities for common garden experiments and ob-
servations of mating behaviour under controlled condi-
tions. Our state-of-the art laboratory facilities include
a MJ Tetrad PCR machine and an ABI 3100 sequencer,
with access to a high-throughput ABI 3730 48-capillary
machine. In addition, our Functional Genomics cen-
ter (<http://www.fgcz.unizh.ch/ >www.fgcz.unizh.ch )
oﬀers extensive facilities for proteomics and bioinfor-
matics. The University has recently upgraded its core
bioinformatics facility, which now consists of two 4 pro-
cessor Opteron Servers and an 8 TB ﬁle system capable
of running all Unix-based bioinformatics and phyloge-
netics software packages.
The University is one of the top comprehensive institu-
tions in Europe and the Zoological Museum is a centerSeptember 1, 2005 EvolDir 11
of excellence in behavioural ecology, population genet-
ics and evolution. With a critical mass of researchers
in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
and the neighbouring Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology (ETH Zurich), Zurich oﬀers an exceptional aca-
demic environment for research and study.
Zurich is an international city of 350,000 located at the
heart of Europe, with world-class facilities for sport,
music and theatre. With its location at the head of
Lake Zurich and its proximity to the Swiss Alps, there
are incredible opportunities for sailing, skiing, hiking
and mountaineering in the region. Zurich was recently
ranked the top city in the world for quality of living.Interested candidates should submit a Curricu-
lum vitae and statement of research interests,

ABI377 service
As many of you know, ABI is discontinuing service for
377 sequencers in 2006 to focus exclusively on their cap-
illary sequences. Even though the 377 is a perfectly ﬁne
instrument, many of us are likely facing the same dilema
of either purchasing a new capillary sequencer that can
be serviced, or ﬁnding alternative sources of service for
our 377’s.
Given the number of 377 machines that are likely still
out there, I would guess that there are third party com-
panies that may ﬁll the servicing void. However, I do
not know if there are any such companies out there.
Do any of you know of alternative sources for servic-
ing ABI 377 sequencers? How are other that are using
these machines dealing with this problem.

/gemi.mpl.ird.fr Biology, Medicine and Society
Dear colleagues,
I have great pleasure in informing you of the inaugura-
tion of a new think-tank in Montpellier, France, on the
theme: “Biology, Medicine and Society”.
Progress in the biological and medical sciences has been
rapid, pressed forward by the explosion in technology,
in particular in genetics and genomics. These develop-
ments must be accompanied, supported, and put into
perspective by parallel deliberation in the arenas of re-
ligion, psychology, psychoanalysis, history, philosophy
and politics (“Politics” is not meant here in the sense
of politicking, but rather as an elaboration of a vision
of society and the world).
The dialogue between the hard sciences and the social
sciences is a diﬃcult one. Attitudes, sensibilities, and
vocabulary diﬀer. This dialogue, freed from all hege-
monic temptation on both sides, is nevertheless essen-
tial if it is our ambition to draw up a new ethics and
epistemology of biology that is truly adapted to our era.
I believe that this enterprise responds to the expecta-
tions of many (most particularly students, whether they
be in the biomedical sciences or the social sciences),
and I ﬁnd they are indispensable to revitalizing scien-
tiﬁc thinking that personally I see falling into a state of
total decay.
This scientiﬁc thought seems to me to be mainly weak-
ened by scientiﬁc taboos, the “gurutizing of science”
and the proliferation of irrational thinking.
Taboos: all subjects relating more or less to a biolog-
ical vision of human nature are a priori heretic. Cer-
tain taboos have perverted and biased the scientiﬁc ap-
proach and, in a new “clerical treason” (Benda), have
resulted in salvaging ideologies whose good intentions
are not much on an excuse. Science has a duty to re-
main objective and neutral. “Only truth is revolution-
ary” (Gramsci). A modern ethics/epistemology of biol-
ogy will be born only if it can be founded on a science
liberated of every taboo.
Gurutizing of science: many of our colleagues have
succumbed to the “guru” syndrome. Awarded with
some title to glory in a very specialized domain, they
proclaim themselves omniscient and pronounce oracles
to decision-makers who are too easily misled by the
aura of the learned scientist on subjects ranging from
global warming to reproductive cloning, and the equal-
ity/inequality of Man. It is urgent that we return
to truly rigorous scientiﬁc thinking, that we establish
strict hierarchies between what has been solidly (but
never deﬁnitively) established and the speculative. TheSeptember 1, 2005 EvolDir 25
credibility of science depends on it, given the:
Proliferation of irrational thinking: Scientiﬁc thinking
is in decline, and science is in the throes of considerable
mistrust from the public, who lend a receptive ear to
a wide variety of demagogues. We must undoubtedly
banish excessive scientism, smelling sweetly of the 19th
century (the belief that science was capable of resolving
all of society’s problems and that only rational thinking
was the source of true knowledge). However, when it is
a matter of problems falling within the domain of sci-
ence (GMOs, global warming, the biological component
of human nature), obscurantism, superstition and the
irrational should be combatted by revitalized scientiﬁc
thinking.
The “Biology, Medicine and Society” (BMS) think-tank
will be a place for multidisciplinary dialogue, hosting
not only specialists (biologists, physicians, psychoana-
lysts, ethnologists, philosophers, people of letters and
religion, historians, politicians, etc.), but it will also be
a place for high school and university students, non-
specialist citizens, etc. We intend to make it a place
of true debate, able to unite in a spirit of tolerance
participants whose convictions may at ﬁrst seem irrec-
oncilable. A “debate” gathering protagonists who agree
on nearly everything is about as exciting as a ﬂat elec-
troencephalogram. If the controversy focuses on the
theory

priced to me. If you know of any company or have
experience in ordering new microsats, please contact

Bird micros answers
Dear colleagues, thank you so much for your helpful
input. As far as I can see, the prices are in the same
range at most companies. So, if you have to spend your
money carefully, it might be best to develop primers on
your own, or - as someone suggested - collaborate with
a lab having experience in this ﬁeld, bring your own
student and consumables, make use of their expertise
and share the publication.
I have also added a short summary of replies; numbers
in parentheses reﬂect how often an institution has been
suggested. Given prices are those people have sent me
in their e-mails, I did not check if they are still up to

Bootstrapping micros
Dear all,
I would be most grateful for ways to construct and boot-
strap trees using microsatellite data from individual an-
imals (not populations) as separate data points.
My question concerns the relative relatedness of 33 in-
dividuals within a small, interbreeding population of
zebras. None of the animals are known parent-oﬀspring
pairs. I have tried RELATEDNESS and CERVUS, but
to my knowlege, neither program boostraps trees.

Crustacean micro problems
Hi, I have been developing microsatellites for 3 species
of Galatheidae for the past year and although the de-
velopmental process went well and plasmid sequencing
gave microsatellites and ﬂanking regions which were
suﬃcient to develop primers I am now having prob-
lems with optimisation and ampliﬁcation. I am some-
how amplifying product of incorrect size (as to what
the primers were designed for- larger fragments) and
am getting multiple bands and lots of background noise
when trying to screen samples. Of the two micros that I
have managed to optimise the screening concluded that
they were uninformative (everything I screened includ-
ing 19 adult individuals from a single area as well as
a mother and 75 eggs where all found to have identi-
cal heterozygote bands!). I am confused by this result
and was wondering if anyone has had similar problems
with crustaceans or could oﬀer advice as to possible
problems that could be causing this or how to proceed.
Thanking you in advance for any comments you could
oﬀer

Drawing trees
Hello Everyone,
I have been producing trees in PHYLIP (after a long
break from tree building), and cannot get the bootstrapvalues on my plots. From memory I believe that I used
to manipulate the trees elsewhere, and add in the values
from the output ﬁle by hand.
Does anybody know of a programme (for MS system)
that will read the PHYLIP ﬁles and place the bootstrap
values at the nodes?...I have spent the day ’surﬁng’ and
cant seem to ﬁnd anything suitable.
Thank you for any assistance,

Drawing trees answers
Thank you to all of those who responded so quickly
(Prof Maddison,Dr Burg, Dr Dharne, Dr Stern) to my
question on ’bootstrap values and tree viewing in other
programs’
The suggestions were:- Mesquite (possibly depending
on input ﬁle) NJplot TREEVIEW32
I chose TREEVIEW and it worked with my PHYLIP
ﬁle. Be aware when it initially opens not all of the
buttons are highlighted. Go to Tree in the upper menu
bar and then select ’show internal edge label’....you will
then see your bootstrap values.
Thanks once again, E Brede

ESEB and debate on evolution
Dear Colleagues,
ESEB Meeting in Krakow is approaching with great
speed. It’s been preceded by a laud debate after Car-
dinal Sch¨ onborn remark on evolutionary theory in NY
Times. Often I wished I had a babble ﬁsh, this inge-
nious invention of Douglas Adams’, or it’s visual equiv-
alent I could put on my nose, to understand some of the
thought and feeling posted on Evoldir recently. Rather
then putting a stick in an ant hill again, I would like to
draw your attention to a reaction the Cardinal’s letter
precipitated in Krak´ ow. Below are a few words of expla-
nation written by Jacek Slusarczyk, who informed me
that they can be reprinted or distributed free of charge,
providing the logo Tygodnik Powszechny is displayed.
The two attached articles were translated Witold Tur-
opolski.
See you in Krakow = Do zobaczenia w Krakowie.

Cardinal Christoph Sch¨ onborn described neo-
Darwinism as untrue and incompatible with the
teaching of the Church. His op-ed article in The New
York Times“, published on 7 July this year, caused
a storm in scientiﬁc circles. Now the Archbishop of
Vienna and one of the main editors of the Catechism
of the Catholic Church explains what he meant to say
- in ”Tygodnik Powszechny“, a Catholic weekly from
Cracow, founded in 1945, with which Karol Wojty a
cooperated for years. Cardinal Sch¨ onborn’s position
is countered by Reverend Professor Micha Heller, a
philosopher, physicist and cosmologist, a participant
of academic meetings with John Paul II in Castel
Gandolfo, a researcher at the Vatican Observatory and
a member of the prestigious Pontiﬁcal Academy of

DARWIN IN STAINED GLASS
A new debate over the theory of evolution
”Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be
true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense - an
unguided, unplanned process of random variation and
natural selection - is not.“ This sentence from an op-ed
article by Cardinal Christoph Sch¨ onborn in ”The New
York Times“ caused a storm in scientiﬁc circles. We
asked the Archbishop of Vienna what he meant to say.
Cardinal Sch¨ onborn has just returned from a prayer in
the cathedral to the seminary situated at the foot of
the Wawel Hill. He came to Cracow as a private per-
son. The sixty year old Dominican priest is joking that
in Vienna he had left his press spokesman Erich Leit-
enberger completely engulfed by work: since ”The New
York Times“ published his article ”Finding Design in
Nature“, the telephone won’t stop ringing. The Cardi-
nal, who is a theologian and philosopher by education,
has been interested in the issues of creation and evo-
lution for good thirty years. Many times he spoke on
the subject at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith. Now he does not hide his contentment that he
managed to provoke a heated discussion: ”A good thing
about the debate over evolution in America is that it
is much more lively than in Europe“, he tells ”Tygod-
nik Powszechny“. He regrets, however, that Austrian
newspapers - he did not follow other European media -
limited themselves to emotional slogans: Kulturkampf,
turning back to a time before the Enlightenment, the
Church should not interfere with science.
”Today the Church’s task is to defend reason“, explains
Cardinal Sch¨ onborn. ”In principle I do not question
that evolution has taken place. It is a scientiﬁcally open
and in many respects also probable hypothesis. But the
question is: is the evolution an unguided process? Per-
haps it allows us to learn about design, intelligence,
reason and order¿‘
Beetles and theology
Archbishop J´ ozef yci ski, the author of the book ”God
and Evolution“, claims that ”the Church did not ﬁght
the theory of evolution“. The metropolitan bishop of
Lublin reminds us that Darwin had a Christian fu-
neral ”in the Westminster Abbey, where there were
even plans to immortalize him in one of the stained
glass windows, as a man who contributed greatly to
the progress of science.“ His family wanted him to be-30 EvolDir September 1, 2005
come a priest, but during his studies ”he discovered
that he is more interested in beetles than in theology;
he changed his interests - and this proved to be good
for science.“ The ﬁrst disputes between Christians and
Darwinists did not result from scientiﬁc premises, but
from naive fears that the teaching on natural selection
might become harmful for humanism. At the same time
many theologians recognized that - as Father Marek S
omka, the author of the book ”Christian Evolutionism
on the Human Origin“, said - ”God manifests His cre-
ative powers in evolutionary transformations; there

Haplotype conﬁguration test
Dear Evoldir members, I want to apply the haplotype
conﬁguration test proposed by Innan et al. 2005 (Ge-

the software Haploconﬁg. I performed several simula-
tions (10000) with the program but my observed haplo-
type conﬁguration never appeared. Does it mean that
my observed conﬁguration in not probable under my
null hypothesis? Is there some way to calculate directly
the probabilities of all the possible conﬁgurations for
my data? Ill appreciate if someone can give me some
“tips” or recommend literature about this topic. Thank

Isolation distance altitude
Hey, I have got a question regarding isolation by dis-
tance: I am working with microsatellites and want to
test, if genetic diﬀerentiation is correlated with altitude,
but I have read that this might result in artiﬁcial out-
comes, because there is no theoretical background for
the relationship of Fst and altitude. Is this true and if
yes, how can I deal with this problem in another way?
I would be thankful for suggestions and will post a sum-
mary of answers.

Jesuit rebuttal
Brian, I am aware that the discussion following the
NYT Op-Ed piece by Christoph Sch¨ onborn has been
moved from evoldir. Nonetheless, I thought the recent
response by George Coyne, SJ, Director of the Vatican
Observatory, might be of general interest to the evoldir
community. It reveals that Sch¨ onborn’s views should
not be taken as representative for the church in gen-
eral, and highlights the quite controversial discussion
among leading representatives of the church. Feel freeSeptember 1, 2005 EvolDir 31

LeafDNAextraction answers
Dear colleagues, thank you to all that have contributed
with suggestions to my email : “Oaks dry leaves DNA
extraction”.
The message was about how to optimize DNA extrac-
tion from dried oak leaves.
RESPONSES:
Dear Colleague, I have no particular experience with
oak, but I have done some work on Sorbus aucuparia.
One potential problem with dried material is that it
has not been properly dried. I had this problem with
sorbus leaves that were dried to slowly on silicagel (be-
cause the leaves were put in an envelope). If this is
the case with your samples, it might well be that the
DNA is degraded in the leave material. What exactly
do you mean by poor results? Do you mean that yousee little DNA on a control gel or that PCR yield is
low, or both? To increase the purity of your DNA sam-
ple you can try the following: - repeat the chloroform
protein extraction once before adding isopropanol. -
skip the incubation at -20C for 90 minutes (DNA pre-
cipitation). Just mix gently 50 times and if necessary
incubate 5 min on ice. DNA quantitavely precipitates
at room temperature in a isopropanol/water solution.
By incubating 90 minutes at -20C, you probably do not
increase the yield of DNA but i! nstead increase copre-
cipitation of undesirable compounds that may inhibit
further enzymatic reactions (PCR, restriction). If you
are performing PCRs, you should add non-acetylated
Bovine Serum Albumine to the PCR mix (ﬁnal con-
centration: 200 µg/ml). It greatly imrpoved the yield
and consistency of the PCRs I made on Sorbus. I hope
these comments will be of help. Good luck and kind
regards, Olivier Rasp´ e
Dragos, you can get fairly large quantities of clean DNA
from old oak leaves using several diﬀerent protocols, in-
cluding Qiagen’s Plant DNeasy kit or Qiagen’s DNA
Mini Kit. However, I work on oaks and I have used a
protocol from Keim et al. followed by a clean up us-
ing the Qiagen DNA Mini Kit and I am able to get
large quantities of clean DNA. The Keim citation and
adapted protocol is pasted below: Plant DNA Extrac-
tion Protocol (old leaves) (adapted from: Keim, P. et
al. 1989. Genetic Analysis of an Interspeciﬁc Swarm
of Populus: Occurrence of Unidirectional Introgression.
Genetics 123: 557-565.)
1. Grind approximately 0.5g leaf material to a ﬁne
powder with a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen.
Make sure to keep leaf material frozen at -70 degrees C
until ready to use. 2.Warm extraction buﬀer to 650C.
3.Immediately add 1mL extraction buﬀer and 20 mi-
croliters of 20mg/mL proteinase K to leaf powder. Mix
well and incubate at 650C for 1 to 11
2hours or overnight
while shaking constantly (on a shaker). 4.After incu-
bation, add 100 microliters of 5M potassium acetate
and incubate on ice for 1 hour. 5.Centrifuge to pel-
let debris. 6.Place supernatant in a new, clean 1.5mL
tube and add 0.65 volume ice-cold isopropanol. Dis-
card pelleted debris. 7.Incubate tubes at -80 degrees
C for 15 minutes followed by incubation at 4 degrees
C overnight. 8.Centrifuge at high speed for 15 min-
utes to pellet DNA 9.Wash pellet in 70% ethanol and
air dry overnight. 10.Resuspend in sterile ddH2O or
TE buﬀer. 11.For very clean DNA, follow with Qia-
gen’s DNA Mini Kit clean-up using the “crude lysates”
protocol. You can also try 2 phenol-chloroform clean-
ups depending on how clean ou need the DNA to be.

luck, Kathy, University of Illinois at Chicago.
Hi, I suggest a similar protocol (attached as well as the
paper where it is from). The sorbitol extraction might
help to get rid of some secondary compunds which are
more abundant in old leaves. Additionally, you may
add a bit of PVP to the extraction steps which has a
similar eﬀect. (Forget about the CTAB conservation
- we use the protocol a lot for a wide range of plant
and fungal material and also for herbarium samples) Of
course, the quality and yield of the DNA will depend
on the speed and way the leaves were dried. If the DNA
is degraded already, you can’t help it. But this can be
checked by running an aliquot of the isolated DNA on
a gel ﬁrst.

Likelihood Bayesian Clocks
Dear Colleagues,
I am interesting in hearing advice or comments from
anyone who has used either Mike Sanderson’s R8’s or
Jeﬀ Thorne’s MULTIDIVTIME to estimate divergence
times from DNA sequence data.
I am especially interested in hearing advice on how treat
analyses of multiple data sets. Is there a way to com-
bine information from multiple genes with diﬀerent mu-
tation rates in R8’s?
Similarly, I am interested in the eﬀect of model pa-
rameters on the behavior of MULTIDIVTIME. The re-
lease notes suggest that the most complicated model
that can be implemented is F84+gamma. Does anyone
have experience using this program for data sets where
more complicated models - say, GTR+I+G for example
- are justiﬁed? What are the consequences of using thesimpler model if the data depart signiﬁcantly from the
expectations of F84+gamma?

Micro polymorphisms answers
Hi all,
Here is the summary of responses that I received to my
question: Do you have experience with lack of poly-
morphism using microsatellites? for those that were
interested.
Thanks a lot again to those that responded!!
Florence NOEL
1- The species could be apomictic 2- Generally [XY]n
less than ten are not very informative. I also tend to
steer clear of interrupted or complex microsatellites. 3-
Microsatellites which have interrupted repeats (for ex-
ample, GAGAGATGAGAGA where there’s a T inter-
rupting the GA repeat motif) are often less ploymorphic
than microsatellites with uninterrupted repeat motifs.
The reason is probably that a substitution in the repeat
motif changes the mutation process (from slippage- to
point mutations) and that this lowers the mutation rate
and hence the level of polymorphism. 4- The mean of
reproduction and the size of the populations could also
explain the lack of genetic diversity.

NYT Intelligent Design
August 5, 2005 Design for Confusion By PAUL KRUG-
MAN I’d like to nominate Irving Kristol, the neocon-
servative former editor of The Public Interest, as the
father of “intelligent design.” No, he didn’t play any
role in developing the doctrine. But he is the father
of the political strategy that lies behind the intelligent
design movement - a strategy that has been used with
great success by the economic right and has now been
adopted by the religious right.
Back in 1978 Mr. Kristol urged corporations to make
“philanthropic contributions to scholars and institu-
tions who are likely to advocate preservation of a strong
private sector.” That was delicately worded, but the
clear implication was that corporations that didn’t like
the results of academic research, however valid, should
support people willing to say something more to their
liking.
Mr. Kristol led by example, using The Public Inter-
est to promote supply-side economics, a doctrine whose
central claim - that tax cuts have such miraculous posi-
tive eﬀects on the economy that they pay for themselves
- has never been backed by evidence. He would later
concede, or perhaps boast, that he had a “cavalier at-
titude toward the budget deﬁcit.”
“Political eﬀectiveness was the priority,” he wrote in
1995, “not the accounting deﬁciencies of government.”
Corporations followed his lead, pouring a steady stream
of money into think tanks that created a sort of par-
allel intellectual universe, a world of “scholars” whose
careers are based on toeing an ideological line, rather
than on doing research that stands up to scrutiny by
their peers.
You might have thought that a strategy of creating
doubt about inconvenient research results could work34 EvolDir September 1, 2005
only in soft ﬁelds like economics. But it turns out that
the strategy works equally well when deployed against
the hard sciences.
The most spectacular example is the campaign to dis-
credit research on global warming. Despite an over-
whelming scientiﬁc consensus, many people have the
impression that the issue is still unresolved. This im-
pression reﬂects the assiduous work of conservative
think tanks, which produce and promote skeptical re-
ports that look like peer-reviewed research, but aren’t.
And behind it all lies lavish ﬁnancing from the energy
industry, especially ExxonMobil.
There are several reasons why fake research is so eﬀec-
tive. One is that nonscientists sometimes ﬁnd it hard
to tell the diﬀerence between research and advocacy -
if it’s got numbers and charts in it, doesn’t that make
it science?
Even when reporters do know the diﬀerence, the con-
ventions of he-said-she-said journalism get in the way
of conveying that knowledge to readers. I once joked
that if President Bush said that the Earth was ﬂat, the
headlines of news articles would read, “Opinions Dif-
fer on Shape of the Earth.” The headlines on many
articles about the intelligent design controversy come
pretty close.
Finally, the self-policing nature of science - scientiﬁc
truth is determined by peer review, not public opinion
- can be exploited by skilled purveyors of cultural re-
sentment. Do virtually all biologists agree that Darwin
was right? Well, that just shows that they’re elitists
who think they’re smarter than the rest of us.
Which brings us, ﬁnally, to intelligent design. Some
of America’s most powerful politicians have a deep
hatred for Darwinism. Tom DeLay, the House ma-
jority leader, blamed the theory of evolution for the
Columbine school shootings. But sheer political power
hasn’t been enough to get creationism into the school
curriculum. The theory of evolution has overwhelming
scientiﬁc support, and the country isn’t ready - yet - to
teach religious doctrine in public schools.
But what if creationists do to evolutionary theory what
corporate interests did to global warming: create a
widespread impression that the scientiﬁc consensus has
shaky foundations?
Creationists failed when they pretended to be engaged
in science, not religious indoctrination: “creation sci-
ence” was too crude to fool anyone. But intelligent
design, which spreads doubt about evolution without
being too overtly religious, may succeed where creation
science failed.The important thing to remember is that like supply-
side economics or global-warming skepticism, intelli-
gent design doesn’t have to attract signiﬁcant support
from actual researchers to be eﬀective. All it has to do
is create confusion, to make it seem as if there really is
a controversy about the validity of evolutionary theory.
That, together with the political muscle of the religious
right, may be enough to start a process that ends with
banishing Darwin from the classroom.

LAMARC version 2.0.2 is now available for download
at
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/lamarc/-
lamarc.download.html This release ﬁxes a problemwith v2.0 runs with multiple replicates in likelihood
analyses, and problems with v2.0 runs with multiple
genomic regions in Bayesian and (in one case) likeli-
hood analyses. You will need to download and run the
new version if you:
- Ran a likelihood analysis with replication. - Ran a
Bayesian analysis with multiple genomic regions. - Ran
a likelihood analysis with multiple genomic regions and
speciﬁed diﬀerent eﬀective population sizes (e.g., for
nuclear and mtDNA) for the diﬀerent genomic regions.
Versions of LAMARC prior to 2.0 and analyses that
did not fall into one of the three above categories are
unaﬀected by this bug.
If you were a student at the Workshop on Molecular
Evolution at Woods Hole, you might have LAMARC
version 2.0.1a, which this version also supercedes.
Replication, as you might recall, is a feature added in
v2.0 that estimated parameters from a single region
multiple times. Since no new data is included in these
anlyses, the likelihood curves need to be averaged, but
instead were being multiplied, resulting in similar esti-
mates, but too-narrow conﬁdence intervals.
Parameter estimates from diﬀerent genomic regions,
however, each come from unique data, so the probabil-
ity curves need to be multiplied. In Bayesian runs, these
curves were being averaged, resulting in similar esti-
mates, but too-wide conﬁdence intervals. (Good news
if your conﬁdence intervals were disappointing.)
Version 2.0 has only been out for a couple of months,
but if you’ve already analyzed a lot of data and are
loathe to repeat it, there may be hope for you yet.
If you have done a likelihood run with multiple repli-
cates and/or with diﬀerent speciﬁed eﬀective popula-
tion sizes and have saved a ’summary ﬁle’ from this
run (by default, the name of this ﬁle is ’outsumﬁle’),
this summary ﬁle can be read in by version 2.0.2 to re-
do the analysis on the same set of trees, saving you the
time spent generating the trees.
If you have done a Bayesian run with multiple genomic
regions, you can multiply the ’curveﬁles’ from the indi-
vidual regions by hand to produce accurate estimates
over all regions. In brief, you take the ﬁles labelled
’curveﬁle reg1 *’, ’curveﬁle reg2 *’, (etc.) for the ap-
propriate parameter, line them up, multiply the values
for the same points by each other, integrate over the re-
sult, then divide by the result of the integration (so the
resulting curve will integrate to 1.0). The peak of this
curve is your Most Probable Estimate (MPE), and you
can integrate over sections of the curve to get your con-
ﬁdence intervals. Don’t forget that by default, many of36 EvolDir September 1, 2005
these curveﬁles will be on the log scale!
As a reward for reading this far, we have also included
an enhancement with the new code: you can now read
and write summary ﬁles from a Bayesian run. In ad-
dition, these summaries are now written as they are
generated, so a run that is terminated halfway through
now can be (partially) recovered.
Please don’t hesitate to e-mail the LAMARC team
(lamarc@gs.washington.edu) if you have any questions
about the new code, or for more details on how to per-
form the recovery steps outlined above.

Software PaupUp
Dear Evoldir members, The ones here interested in phy-
logenetics probably know the PAUP* software from
D. Swoﬀord. It is indeed a very useful package for
phylogenetics analysis and probably one of the most
widely used nowadays. Unfortunately, there is no user-
friendly interface for PC versions (both DOS and Win-
dows are essentially line input command based). This
makes PAUP* a diﬃcult software to use both for re-
search but also for education purposes on PC com-
puters. That is why we provide today PaupUp, a
user-friendly interface to PAUP* DOS version avail-
able for free at http://www.agro-montpellier.fr/sppe/-
Recherche/JFM/PaupUp/ This interface is a frontend
and therefore DOES NOT include PAUP* that needs
to be purchased. It includes around 80% of the avail-
able commands, representing in our opinion the most
commonly used ones, and the rest can still be entered
in a command line interface as usual. PaupUp also in-
cludes links with treeview software for drawing trees
and Modeltest. We hope that PaupUp will prove as
useful to you as it has proven for educational purpose
here.
Sincerely,
Jean-Francois Martin and Frederic Calendini.Software phyloXML speciﬁcations
ANNOUNCING VERSION 0.3 OF PROPOSED
SPECIFICATIONS FOR phyloXML
This message is to announce the release of version 0.3
for the speciﬁcations of phyloXML level 1.
The speciﬁcations can be found at: http://-
www.phyloxml.org/ Please feel free to comment on it.
Please consider joining our phyloXML Yahoo Group
in order to receive further updates/comments and for
discussion with other interested scientists: http://-
groups.yahoo.com/group/phyloxml/ Our current plans
are to translate these speciﬁcation into an XML Schema
(XSL) and then complete the phyloXML parser/writer
classes in the FORESTER Java package (based on
which ATV is built).
We really appreciate all the insightful comments and
suggestions we got for phyloXML version 0.2 and we
tried to incorporate as many of them as we could, with-
out changing the intentions of phyloXML.
In short, the major changes from version 0.2 to version
0.3 are as follows:
# dropped <parent >tag and replaced with <branch >
tags which can reference clades outside its nested struc-
ture. # Removed all style attributes except color for
branches # The <length >child tag of <branch >is now
a<distance >tag and can have associated attributes,
for example, unit. # The <name>child tag of <clade>
changed to <label>. # Dropped two child tags from
<sequence >:<pathway name>and<pathway id>.
# Dropped <expression >tag. All non-phylogenetic
data associated with sequences and clades will have to
be represented as <custom >tags.
(The speciﬁcation document itself is more comprehen-
sive.)
Thank you,

Subtraction cDNA kitsSeptember 1, 2005 EvolDir 37
Hi,
I’ll have to use a subtraction cDNA kit (supression sub-
tractive hybridization or SSH) next semester and I need
feedback from people who used one; if it worked well,
which company was it from, what to be carefull with
and what kind of results you have obtained.
As for now, I was considering the Clontech PCR-Select
cDNA subtraction kit.
Thanks in advance

models of ﬁsheries-induced adaptive change. This mod-
elling framework aims at combining a realistic descrip-
tion of the ecological setting as well as population struc-
ture with a description of genetic detail at a level that
would still allow predictions on rate of evolutionary
change. Potential empirical interfaces include applica-
tions to cod, plaice, salmon and oysters.
The post is funded as part of a EU Marie Curie Re-
search Training Network FishACE (Fisheries-induced
Adaptive Change in Exploited Stocks). According to

CSIRO Canberra CitrusPhylogeny
We are seeking candidates to apply to work on the fol-
lowing project:
Title: A multilocus linkage group phylogeny of Citrus
(Rutaceae: Limonioideae).
Project Background: The Citrus industry is one of the
largest horticultural industries in the world and the
breeding of new, high quality Citrus cultivars for the in-
dustry depends on reliable information about the rela-
tionships among the cultivated and wild Citrus species.
Wild Citrus species are of interest to Citrus breeders
as they possess genes that may provide a number of
beneﬁcial traits (e.g., disease resistance and new fruit
characteristics). Although, Citrus fruits are the most
widely cultivated tree fruit in the world, the evolution-
ary origins of many of the commercial classes of culti-
vars, i.e. lemons, oranges, limes, grapefruits, are un-
known. As a consequence it has been exceedingly diﬃ-
cult to produce new cultivars by traditional hybridiza-
tion/selection techniques, and it is therefore important
to understand the relationships among the diﬀerent
species of the tribe for advancing breeding techniques
and developing better conservation strategies for wild
germplasm. Our current understanding of the group
suggest that few of the cultivated species are true bi-
ological species [e.g., C. maxima (pummelo), C. med-
ica (citron) and C. reticulata (mandarin / tangerine)],
while many of the more widely known Citrus types [e.g.,
sweet oranges (C. sinensis), grapefruits (C. paradisi),
lemons (C. limon), sour oranges (C. aurantium) and
limes (C. aurantifolia)] are ﬁxed hybrid biotypes de-
rived from the “true” species that are maintained by
vegetative reproduction. The chimeric nature of these
hybrid Citrus genomes makes it impossible to apply
standard phylogenetic strategies for determining his-
torical genetic relationships.
Proposed Research: We propose to produce phylogenies
based on sequences representing each arm of the nine40 EvolDir September 1, 2005
chromosomes in the Citrus genome. The resulting phy-
logenies will help us determine the phylogenetic origin
of each of the chromosomes arms of the of the vari-
ous cultivar groups. >From this information we will
be able to establish the origin of each linkage group in
each of the cultivar groups, i.e., oranges, grapefruits,
lemons, and limes. Rudimentary genetic linkage maps
exist for Citrus. To date, 19 linkage maps have been
constructed from a series of ten studies. These maps
will form the basis for selecting appropriate sequences
from each linkage group for sequencing and phyloge-
netic reconstruction.
Tenure: 3 years
Salary: $58K to $64K (Australian dollars)
Eligibility: International applicants welcome. To be
eligible for a Postdoctoral Fellowship you will have re-
ceived your Ph.D. after the 1st Jan 2003.
Closing Date for Application: 1 September 2005

A one-year post doctoral position is being funded by
the DAAD ( www.daad.de ) to work in my laboratory
on apomixis evolution in St John’s wort (Hypericum
perforatum).
St John’s wort populations are composed of diploid sex-
ual and/or tetraploid facultative apomictic (asexual re-
production through seed) forms. We are interested in
understanding how and why apomixis has evolved in
Hypericum, and how the expression of apomixis may
be correlated with polyploidy and/or interspeciﬁc hy-
bridization.
We have a large number of wild accessions growing in
our greenhouses, in addition to a number of crosses be-
tween sexual and apomictic genotypes. We are fur-
thermore generating a genetic map using AFLP and
microsatellite markers, and are quantifying variation
in the apomictic phenotype using ﬂow cytometric seed
screens. The post doctoral position would involve the
analysis of microsatellite and SNP markers in the wild
and crossing populations.My lab is found at the IPK in Gatersleben ( www.ipk-
gatersleben.de ), which is about 2 hours southwest of
Berlin near the beautiful Harz mountains ( http://-

hiking, mountain biking and skiing. The IPK is a very
well funded institute which is composed of a broad spec-
trum of research groups working on many diﬀerent as-
pects of plant genetics.
The position is scheduled to start in May 2006.

Postdoctoral / Research Associate Position in Evolu-
tionary Developmental Genomics of Horned Beetles
We are seeking a motivated individual for a new
project applying functional genomics to study the
evolutionary developmental genetics of horned beetles
in the genus Onthophagus. We study beetle horns
as an example of an evolutionary novelty that has
undergone a tremendous amount of morphological
diversiﬁcation. We are developing the ﬁrst genomic
resources to explore the genomic basis of this diver-
siﬁcation, which so far has only been studied using
a target-gene approach. This project is an interdisci-
plinary collaboration between the labs of Justen An-
drews ( http://www.bio.indiana.edu/facultyresearch/-
faculty/Andrews.html ) and Armin Moczek ( http:/-
/www.bio.indiana.edu/facultyresearch/faculty/-
Moczek.html ) and provides an outstanding opportunity
to train across disciplines.
The immediate aims include developing a comprehen-
sive EST library and microarrays to screen for diﬀer-September 1, 2005 EvolDir 41
ential gene expression in the context of horn develop-
ment in alternative male morphs, sexual dimorphisms,
and interspecﬁc diﬀerences in the type and location of
horn growth. Consequently, the position suits candi-
dates with a strong background in molecular biology
and/or biochemistry, and a background in bioinformat-
ics would also be advantageous. Additionally, since the
project focuses on non-model organisms it will require
a creative and independent researcher. We will provide
substantial technical and conceptual support, however,
the successful candidate will be expected to conduct
signiﬁcant amounts of work independently.
The research environment at IUB is outstanding and
it is expected the successful candidate will participate
in the scholarly activities of the Department as well as
attending conferences, preparing manuscripts and con-
tributing to grant applications. It should be noted that
the campus is well equipped with the infrastructure
required for the project ( <http://cgb.indiana.edu/-
>http://cgb.indiana.edu/ ). Additionally the project
will beneﬁt from the concentration of arthropod ge-
nomics at IU including The Drosophila Genomics Re-
source Center ( <http://dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/ >http:/-
/dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/ ), the Daphnia Genomics

The position is available immediately for 1-2 years
contingent upon progress, and may possibly be ex-
tended to include a third year. Candidates must
have a Masters or PhD degree in a suitable ﬁeld and
appropriate experience. Salary is $35-$40K (plus

SabbaticalsWorkshops
Postdoctoral Fellows, Sabbaticals, and Workshops at
the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NES-
Cent) is a new NSF-funded center in Durham, North
Carolina. Our Center represents a collaborative eﬀort
by three Universities in North Carolina’s Research Tri-
angle: Duke, NC State, and UNC-Chapel Hill. Our
goal is to help foster a grand synthesis of the biologi-
cal disciplines through the unifying principle of descent
with modiﬁcation.
NESCent announces a call for proposals for Postdoc-
toral Fellows, Sabbaticals, and two kinds of workshops
(Catalysis Meetings and Working Groups). NESCent
will be targeting 7 postdocs, 5 sabbatical faculty, and
4 groups. Proposals are welcome from scientists of all
nationalities and successful applicants will join our on-
site community of scientists as well as interacting with
many visiting working groups. The range of activities
supported by the center will include ambitious eﬀorts
to synthesize existing data from a wide range of dis-
ciplines, database development and exploitation, and
theoretical research of all kinds.
Postdoctoral Fellows will be supported for two years
at a salary of $36 K per year plus research expenses.
Sabbatical fellowships fall under two categories: “tradi-
tional” half-salary fellowships; and our novel “targeted
sabbatical” program. Targeted full-salary fellowships
will support individuals committed to increasing the
number of applicants to evolutionary biology programs
from Minority Serving Institutions. Each researcher
will have a primary project of their own design, but as a
whole the group will have a great deal of “free energy”
to take advantage of new opportunities for synthesis
and collaboration as they arise.
Cross-Disciplinary Network Catalysis Meetings are one-
time meetings to bring together ~30 scientists from
diverse disciplines to focus on a major question or re-
search area. These meetings are intended to identify
avenues for synthesis, and classes of primary data that
must be collected before grand-scale synthesis is possi-
ble. These meetings are intended to increase the scale
and ambition of our scientiﬁc vision.
Working Group Meetings involve small groups of sci-entists (10-12 participants) collaborating intensively on
the analysis or synthesis of data, models or both, to
address a major question in evolutionary biology, or to
solve a particular analytical problem. NESCent will
not fund collection of new data or ﬁeld research, but
encourages the mining of public and private databases.
The deadline is October 15 for positions and groups be-
ginning in the Summer or Fall of 2006. For complete

ing candidates seeking advanced research training in
insect science and preparation for the additional de-
mands of an academic career. Trainees may receive up44 EvolDir September 1, 2005
to three years of support. Each trainee will participate
in several PERT program components designed to pre-
pare trainees to be successful in tenure track academic
positions. Because the demands of an academic career
include research productivity, teaching, and service, the
following activities will be required of all trainees:
*RESEARCH training is available under the supervi-
sion of one or more participating CIS faculty members
in a wide range of academic units. Detailed descriptions
of CIS faculty research can be obtained from individual
web pages for participating faculty listed at the bottom
of this announcement. Collaborative, interdisciplinary
research is encouraged. Applicants are encouraged to
contact prospective research mentors as early as possi-
ble in the application process. Each trainee will receive
$6,000 in research funds, $1500 for travel, and use of
a laptop computer. The Center for Insect Science pro-
vides a rich environment for research training through
regular seminars, data blitzes, Visiting Distinguished
Scientist series and Hexapodium events.
*TEACHING skills will be developed through partic-
ipation in a two semester science pedagogy program
simultaneously with trainee research. Flexibility exists
with respect to which two semesters will be the peda-
gogy semesters for each trainee. During one semester,
each trainee will attend a three credit hour course in
science pedagogy at the University of Arizona. The
pedagogy course involves the development of a sin-
gle original undergraduate laboratory exercise using in-
sects and feedback on teaching proﬁciency. In a subse-
quent semester, the trainee will teach one undergradu-
ate course and laboratory section at Pima Community
College (PCC), near the University of Arizona, under
the direction of a PCC teaching mentor.
*MENTORING skills will be developed through the su-
pervision of a research project by a minority under-
graduate student from PCC. Undergraduate research
projects may be subcomponents of the trainee’s own
research.
*SERVICE to the CIS community will involve the
PERT seminar series in which trainees select, invite and
host a distinguished insect scientist to deliver a special
seminar each semester at the University of Arizona.
*SURVIVAL SKILLS will be shared with trainees
through special workshops dealing with grant writ-
ing, the job application process, promotion and tenure
strategies and the integration of research, teaching, and
service in an academic career. Workshops will utilize
the strengths of the CIS faculty, including members of

Post Doctoral position available in the Department
of Genetics, University Stellenbosch, South Africa (23
Aug 2005)
A Post Doctoral position in molecular genetics is avail-
able in the Aquaculture Division, Department of Ge-
netics, Stellenbosch University with the project title
“Genetic improvement of the abalone, Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the Western, Southern and Eastern shores of
South Africa and is the only one of the six species that
occurs in South Africa that is commercially exploited.
H. midae displays a very slow growth rate, taking two
to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an obstacle
in the proﬁtable farming and global competitiveness of
this species. In order to increase the productivity and
the proﬁtability of the commercial activity, a research
program has been designed that makes use of the mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. The research program consists of three main
tears: a) establishment of breeding programs with the
assistance of genetic markers, b) generation of linkage
maps and QTL identiﬁcation, c) and the application of
gene transfer technology.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for developing EST and SNP markers in the abalonespecies, Haliotis midae. Only a few ESTs are avail-
able for Haliotis and other mollusk species; therefore
this project will be the ﬁrst large-scale development
of ESTs in a Haliotis species. SNPs identiﬁed within
the ESTs will be used to generate a genetic map of
Haliotis midae together with other markers such as
AFLPs and microsatellites. Novel genes identiﬁed could
also be applied in future gene-transfer technology in
Haliotis midae. Candidate should have a strong back-
ground in molecular genetics with applicable knowledge
in cDNA technology. Practical experience in RNA iso-
lation, reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA library con-
struction and automated sequencing is a prerequisite.
A sound knowledge of sequence analysis or related bio-
statistical software is advisable. The position is avail-
able for 2 years
Interested researchers are requested to send their CV

Workshop: Evolution and Ecology of Biodiversity
PhD workshop Lighthouse of Westerhever, Germany
Sept. 19 ? 21. 2005
PhD students working on evolutionary or ecological as-
pects of biodiversity are invited to apply for participa-
tion in a workshop on ?Evolution and Ecology of Bio-
diversity?.
Focusing on recent, ongoing projects and even plans,
the workshop will give ample opportunity for discus-
sion in a small group, together with Andy Purvis
(London, UK) and Sarah Jackson (Sheﬃeld, UK),
two experts in this ﬁeld of research. We will stay
directly at a beautiful lighthouse at the North Sea.
The program will also comprise a guided tour into
the wadden sea. See http://www.uni-kiel.de/ zoolo-
gie/institut/limnologie/evolecol.htm for further infor-
mation and a ﬂyer for download.
The workshop will begin Monday morning (Sept. 19.)
and end Wednesday evening (Sept. 21.). Westerhever
is in the very north of Germany. We will organize travel
from Kiel, so it is most convenient if you travel to Kiel
on Sunday (Sept. 18). 100 Euro per person are re-
quested as a contribution to food and accommodation.
Please send applications, including title and abstract
(<200 words) of your presentation, until Aug. 22. to

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
