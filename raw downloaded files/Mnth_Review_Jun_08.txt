Comparative Genomics - ﬁnal call for posters
We are inviting submissions of abstracts for posters
at the Scottish Bioinformatics Forum Comparative Ge-
nomics meeting in St. Andrews, Scotland, 13th June
2008.
Submission deadline: 29th May Maximum abstract
length 200 words. Please send your abstract to cjanssen

Full details and conference program: http://-
www.sbforum.org/events.php?e idA Comparative ge-
nomics is a new ﬁeld of increasing power. Within a
decade, we have moved from having a handful of se-
quenced species to thousands, and numbers will con-
tinue to increase. This presents enormous opportunities
to make discoveries of biological and medical interest,
but also requires new approaches. The bottleneck is
shifting from the time taken to sequence genomes, to
the time taken to decide how to analyse them. How-
ever, exciting and novel results are already emerging.
Internationally renowned invited speakers and a poster
session will present cutting-edge developments in this
fast-moving and exciting ﬁeld.

“Communication and cooperation - from genes to be-
haviour”. A symposium in honour of Hubert “Jim”
Markl
International Conference at the University of Konstanz,
Germany 04.-07. September 2008
This interdisciplinary symposium will bring together
scientists from the ﬁelds of sociobiology and neuroethol-
ogy to discuss new concepts and ideas. We hope
that this meeting will facilitate communication between
these biological subdisciplines and encourage integra-
tive approaches. Plenary talks by leaders in their re-
spective ﬁelds will cover animal communication and
cooperation at levels ranging from genes, to individu-
als, societies, and populations. Discussions of relevant
aspects of biophysics, neurobiology, physiology, genet-
ics, ecology and ethology under the unifying concept of
evolution promises to further the understanding of the
“how” and the “why” behaviour.
We especially invite PhD students and Postdocs work-
ing in pertinent ﬁelds to apply for participation in the
symposium. There are time slots reserved for oral con-
tributions by younger scientists and we plan to have a
poster session as well. There are no registration fees
and we will attempt to reimburse travel and accommo-
dation costs (see “Registration”).
This symposium is meant to celebrate the 70th birth-
day of Professor Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Hubert Markl.
Hubert “Jim” Markl played an internationally promi-
nent role during the founding and establishing of the
ﬁelds of both sociobiology and neuroethology.

29th to 30th of May 2008 Two-day Meeting at Univer-
sity of Padua, Italy, Local organiser: Sandro Minelli
FLS Organising Committee : Sandra Knapp, Tim Lit-
tlewood, Alessandro Minelli, Vaughan Southgate on be-
half of The Linnean Society
Getting the names of things right is still essential if we
are to interpret, understand and share our knowledge
of biological diversity.
The 250th anniversary of the publication of Linnaeus’
10th edition of Systema Naturae, the start of mod-
ern zoological nomenclature, will be recognised at this
meeting, at which an international panel of renowned
scientists will present current perspectives and challeng-
ing proposals about names for taxa and names for other
important biological objects and concepts.
This is an important meeting for all working in system-
atics and taxonomy as well as museum curators, those
involved in biodiversity assessment and wildlife conser-
vationists worldwide. Historians of science may also
ﬁnd it helps in understanding the development of the
present system of biological nomenclature and the ways
in which that has evolved over time.
The diﬀerent venues for the event, the Accademia
Galileiana, the historical Botanical Garden and the
Palazzo del B` o, Archivio Antico will link the meeting to
Padova’s long standing academic tradition and provide
a unique opportunity for delegates to move biological
science forward in a historic setting (se http://-
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botanical Garden ofPadova,

Dear all!
This is a reminder for all researchers (Ph.Ds, post-docs
and senior ) working with sexual selection - most wel-
come to a discussion workshop day aiming to develop
sexual selection theory.
Friday the 3rd of October at the Evolutionary Biology
Centre in Uppsala.
Aims: To develop and reﬂect over sexual selection pro-
cesses, i.e. competition for matings, competition to be
choosen as a mate, competition for breeding opportuni-
ties, sexual conﬂicts, dynamics in sexual selection etc.,
in animals, plants and theory. What processes are pre-
dominantly studied in which sex and why? How can
we by discussing gender perspectives in sexual selec-
tion contribute to a more gender-neutral evolutionary
biology theory.
The workshop is aimed for evolutionary bi-
ologists and funded by GenNa (see http://-
www.genna.gender.uu.se/ ).
Most welcome, the deadline for application is 1st of

tinue to increase. This presents enormous opportunities
to make discoveries of biological and medical interest,
but also requires new approaches. The bottleneck is
shifting from the time taken to sequence genomes, to
the time taken to decide how to analyse them. How-

9th International Feline Retrovirus Research Sympo-
sium - Vienna, August 24th - 27th 2008
Dear Colleague
On behalf of the organizing committee for the 9th In-
ternational Feline Retrovirus Research Symposium to
be held in Vienna, Austria, August 24-27, 2008, I am
pleased to invite you and members of your group to
submit abstracts of your latest work. The conference
promises to be an innovative and exciting blend of retro-
viral research, advances in the cat as a model of infec-
tious disease, cat genomics and viral and host evolution.
Felids and their associated retroviruses oﬀer an unique
opportunity to study evolution of both pathogenic and
apathogenic viruses as well as endogenous retroviruses
and the co-adaptation of their respective hosts. The
scientiﬁc committee therefore also speciﬁcally encour-
ages contributions from researchers interested in feline
and viral evolution.
Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by the scientiﬁc
committee and assigned to oral or poster presentations(your preference would be helpful) and the best of these
would receive partial or full ﬁnancial support for atten-
dance. A signiﬁcant amount of the budget will be al-
located for this, so we really would encourage abstract
submission.
Please visit the conference website at http://-
www.retrovirus.at for additional information, submis-
sion of abstracts, and registration. Please note the
deadline for abstracts is June 6, 2008 and an early reg-
istration discount deadline is at the same date. Please
feel free to contact the local organizing committee (of-
ﬁce@retrovirus.at) with any questions.

Eawag is the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science
and Technology, a Swiss-based and internationally op-
erating aquatic research institute within the ETH do-
main.
The Department Aquatic Ecology (group of Bas Ibel-
ings) seeks for
PhD student in the evolution of host-parasite interac-
tions
The PhD student will participate in a collaborative
research project GEDIHAP with several other PhD
students and host-parasite researchers from the ETH
Z¨ urich, the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest Snow and
Landscape Research, WSL, and Eawag to study the in-
ﬂuence of environmental factors (natural and human
induced) on host - parasite interactions. In the project
the impact of 2 environmental stress factors (climate
change and water pollution) on the population dynam-
ics and co-evolution of the diatom Asterionella formosa
and parasitic chytrid fungi is studied.
For this, from CCESS (Competence Center Environ-
ment and Sustainability of the ETH Domain) ﬁnanced
project, we are looking for a highly motivated candidate
with an interest in evolutionary biology, population ge-
netics and host-parasite interactions. The research is
balanced mixture of ﬁeld and lab based studies, exper-
iments will be done under controlled conditions in the
lab as well as under natural conditions in lakes. Hosts
and parasites will be screened using molecular tools like
microsatellites, which are available for both. Part of the
work will be done in the Netherlands.
We oﬀer a stimulating research environment in a lively
and social institute in Kastanienbaum (near Luzern)
and D¨ ubendorf (near Z¨ urich) in a department with sev-
eral other evolutionary and ecological research groups
with a focus on host parasite interactions. The PhD
candidate will be actively involved in workshops and
courses organized within the GEDIHAP framework.
The position will be for a period of three years, and
should start as soon as possible (August 2008 or soon
thereafter). The ideal candidate has both experimental
as well as molecular skills (PCR, sequencing, genotyp-
ing). A Diploma or Master degree or equivalent) in
biology or related subject is necessary for admission.June 2, 2008 EvolDir 15
The working language in the group is English.
Applications should include a letter of interest with a
description of pertinent experience, curriculum vitae,
a list of publications (if any), the names (with e-mail
address) of two potential references, and copies of the
certiﬁcates of academic qualiﬁcations.

A three-year PhD position on population genetics and
ecology of brown trout is available in the Department
of Fish Ecology & Evolution at the Center of Ecology,
Evolution & Biogeochemistry (CEEB) in Eawag, the
Swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technol-
ogy ( http://www.ﬁshecology.ch/ ).
The PhD project is part of a larger project, called EN-
HANCE. ENHANCE is a problem-oriented, interdis-
ciplinary research project funded by the Competence
Center for Environment & Sustainability (CCES) of
the ETH Domain. ENHANCE tests and evaluates
ecosystem connectivity with state-of-the art molecu-
lar genetic experiments and population dynamic anal-
ysis. The successful candidate is expected to develop
a research project that uses molecular ecological tech-
niques to evaluate the consequences of habitat frag-
mentation and de-fragmentation on multiple popula-
tions of brown trout (Salmo trutta). The student will
enroll for a PhD course in Ecology & Evolution at
the Institute of Zoology, University of Bern ( http://-
www.zoology.unibe.ch/ ) and will collaborate with other
research institutes participating in ENHANCE (ETH,
WSL, EPFL), as well as with researchers at Eawag and
the Institute of Zoology.
The successful candidate should have thorough trainingeither in population ecology or population/conservation
genetics, and basic training in the other discipline. M.S.
degree in one of these disciplines is essential. Preference
will be given to candidates with experience in handling
DNA markers (e.g., microsatellites) and molecular ge-

LincolnU FishBarcoding
PhD Position: Bio-protection Centre, Lincoln Univer-
sity, New Zealand.
Biosecurity, high-risk ornamental ﬁsh and molecular ge-
netic detection
New Zealand is a world-leader in the design and im-
plementation of biosecurity systems used to protect its
unique indigenous fauna and ﬂora. This includes the
use of state-of-the-art technologies to detect and pre-
vent the establishment of high-risk exotic species and
their diseases.
A PhD scholarship is available to develop DNA barcod-
ing as a rapid and reliable diagnostic method to iden-
tify targeted exotic ornamental (aquarium) ﬁsh. Or-
namental ﬁsh come from many countries where their
health status is unknown. Furthermore, the mixing of
ﬁsh in wholesale warehouse tanks before export to New
Zealand means shipments may contain species other
than those legally permitted for import. These species
are diﬃcult to detect visually, but they represent a sig-
niﬁcant risk to New Zealand&rsquo;s pristine water-
ways, potentially competing with native species and
introducing exotic pathogens. Laboratory procedures
will principally concern the generation and analysis of
ﬁsh DNA barcode sequences, and sequences of other
genes as appropriate. These data will subsequently be
used to investigate diagnostic platforms based on tech-
nologies such as micro- or macro-arrays, high resolu-
tion melt (HRM) analysis, or a novel nano-engineered
molecular assay. Accordingly, the student will develop
appropriate molecular genetic hypotheses that test the
suitability of barcode gene targets, ﬁsh taxonomic and
evolutionary relationships, and biotechnological limits.
This Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Biosecurity
New Zealand (MAFBNZ) funded PhD scholarship will
be taken up at Lincoln University, Christchurch, New
Zealand. Principal supervisors will be Drs Karen Arm-
strong and Shelley Ball (Lincoln University, http://-www.lincoln.ac.nz/; Bio-Protection Centre), with advi-
sory input from Drs Suzanne Keeling and Colin John-
ston (MAFBNZ, http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/; In-
vestigation and Diagnostic Centre, Wallaceville). This
team combines internationally-recognised expertise in
DNA-based species identiﬁcation systems with experts
in delivery of biosecurity systems. Training will there-
fore involve the transfer of valuable skills required in
the rapidly growing ﬁeld of sciences for biosecurity, and
establish a sound pathway to further academic or rele-
vant employment opportunities within New Zealand or
abroad.
Applicants should have a keen interest in the devel-
opment and application of molecular technologies and
hold, or expect to hold, a high grade undergraduate or
Masters-level degree (or equivalent) in relevant life sci-
ences. The award covers a fulltime stipend, registration
fees, and project costs for a three-year study.
Please e-mail your CV to Dr Karen Armstrong at arm-
stron@lincoln.ac.nz. The closing date for applications
for this studentship is 20/6/08.

There is an opening for a motivated PhD student at
the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (for-
merly MPI for Limnology) to work on a project titled
“The evolution of complex parasite life cycles”.
Many parasites have complex life cycles that involve
switching between several host species. An increase in
life cycle complexity entails clear costs (e.g. parasites
must be transmitted between separate hosts as opposed
to simply reproducing in the current host and they
are likely faced with physiologically and immunologi-
cally divergent host environments). Given these costs,
the evolution and maintenance of life cycle complexity
is paradoxical. Current theory suggests that parasites
may avoid mortality due to predation and/or be able to
reach a larger size at maturity when incorporating hosts
at higher trophic levels, while parasites that add hosts
at a lower trophic level may facilitate transmission to
the ﬁnal host and thereby reduce mortality rates. The
PhD project would address questions of importance in
life cycle evolution using a life history approach and the
tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus as a model system.
This parasite has 3 hosts in its life cycle; a copepod, a
stickleback, and a piscivorous bird. A major advantage
of this system is that the bird ﬁnal host can be re-
placed by an in vitro system, permitting the entire life
cycle to be conveniently kept in the laboratory. Par-
ticular questions of interest include: What advantages
come with adding the bird host into the life cycle of
Schistocephalus? Why doesnt Schistocephalus grow in
birds? How does the parasite invest in switching be-
tween hosts and how is growth divided between hosts?
Is parasite investment into growth and/or transmission-
related traits ﬂexible and context-dependent?
This project is being conducted in collaboration with
Geoﬀ Parker and Jimmy Chubb (University of Liver-
pool). They are producing mathematical models about
life history evolution in complex life cycle parasites. We
intend to test their predictions and collect empirical
data for further reﬁnement of their models.
The position is for 3 years and is research-oriented;
there are very few teaching duties. A Diplom, Master’s
degree or equivalent postgraduate degree is required.
Students with an interest in life history evolution and
host-parasite interactions are especially encouraged to
apply. Research experience with small animals is con-June 2, 2008 EvolDir 19

Short summary of the proposal:
Over the last years, our views of the evolution of micro-
bial genomes changed radically. It is now admitted that
these genomes are aﬀected by evolutionary processes
conjugating both vertical inheritance and lateral gene
transfer, via phages, plasmids and integrons. Genomes
recombine, become larger or smaller by gene losses and
gains, according to rules that still largely remain to
be determined. This PhD aims at studying the evo-
lution of microbial genomes ﬂuidity via genomics and
metagenomics approaches to understand how the ge-
netic material ﬂows within Life’s three domains. Thisambitious project relies ﬁrst on the unprecedented ac-
cumulation of molecular data from organisms in pure
culture (the genomic data) and from the sequencing of
whole microbial communities in their environment (the
metagenomic data). Second, it exploits the latest de-
velopments in bioinformatics : phylogenetic methods of
tree and network reconstruction, and possibly in silico
modeling of microbial genomes evolution. This PhD ad-
dresses three major questions: - Does the nature of the
mobile genetic material change over time and across lin-
eages? - How does the environment inﬂuence genomic
ﬂuidity? - Are in situ and in silico data supporting
similar conclusions?

Senckenberg GlobalChangeGenetics
Senckenberg.GlobalChangeGenetics
Graduate position:
A PhD position is available in global change biol-
ogy/population genetics at the Department of Limnol-
ogy & Conservation, Senckenberg Research Institute
and Natural History Museum, Germany.
Current models suggest that global warming will lead
to massive species extinctions in the near future. It is
expected that certain traits increase susceptibility to-
wards changing climate, including reduced dispersal,
low genetic diversity, small population size, isolation
and low tolerance towards temperature changes. In
Europe, several cold-adapted species of plants and ani-
mals persist as isolated glacial relicts in high altitudes.
Many of these species combine several, if not all of the
above-listed factors and may thus be among the ﬁrst
species to become extinct if global temperature shows
further increase. The PhD candidate will develop and
apply genetic markers (e.g., microsatellites, AFLP, se-
quence data) to investigate genetic population structure
in cold-adapted, montane species in central European
mountain ranges. In particular, research will focus on
patterns of gene ﬂow and isolation among populations,
inbreeding levels within isolated relict populations, andto identify conservation units. Besides the molecular
part, ﬁeld work and controlled laboratory experiments
on temperature and general stress tolerance will be con-
ducted. The study is not focused on a certain taxo-
nomic group; research will thus likely comprise both
plant and animal species. We are looking for a highly
motivated student with a strong interest in biodiversity,
conservation and population genetics. The candidate
is expected to have some experience in the laboratory,
ideally with the application of microsatellite markers
and/or DNA sequencing. Knowledge of German lan-
guage is no precondition, but we expect the willing-
ness to learn some German during the stay. A valid
international drivers licence is required for ﬁeld sam-
pling. The Senckenberg Research Institute and Nat-
ural History Museum (head quarter in Frankfurt am
Main) is among the largest natural history museums in
Europe and has a longstanding tradition in high qual-
ity biodiversity research. The Department of Limnol-
ogy & Conservation is located at the research station
Gelnhausen. The station has all facilities required for
this research (fully equipped molecular lab, laborato-
ries for sample sorting and microscopical analysis, ﬁeld
equipment). Gelnhausen is a quaint town in close prox-
imity to Frankfurt am Main. The city has a picturesque
historic Old Town with several historic sites from the
medieval times and is surrounded by beautiful moun-
tain ranges. Frankfurt am Main, an international city
with a rich and diverse cultural life and unique interna-
tional transport connections, can be reached within 30
minutes by car or train. In order to apply, please send

TWO PhD-POSITIONS in BEHAVIOURAL EVOLU-
TION are available at the Department of Behavioural
Evolution of the Zoological Institute, University of
Bern, Switzerland.
(1) One study will focus on the sharing of tasks,
commodity trading and reciprocity in a cooperatively
breeding cichlid where helpers pay to stay in a safe ter-
ritory. Behaviour, group composition, threat and re-
source availability will be experimentally manipulated.
In addition, long-term ﬁtness eﬀects of diﬀerences in
the propensity to stay and help or to disperse will be
measured in the ﬁeld. (2) The second project inves-
tigates the proximate and ultimate mechanisms of co-
existence of ﬂexible and ﬁxed alternative reproductive
tactics within a species. The model system is a snail-
brooding cichlid where bourgeois males are exploited
by two types of parasitic males. This study will involve
experimental manipulation of tactic frequencies and fe-June 2, 2008 EvolDir 23

ULausanne 3 BehaviouralEvolution
Three PhD-positions in BEHAVIOURAL EVOLU-
TION are available at the Department of Ecology and
Evolution, University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
(1) One study is on parent-oﬀspring conﬂict by fo-
cussing on nestling begging behaviour and sib-sib com-
munication (i.e. so-called sibling negotiation). Thisproject will be based on recent unpublished results sug-
gesting that nestlings produce nest-speciﬁc vocal sig-
nals to indicate their level of need. The project will also
deal with several original issues including the role of
individual recognition and punishment on sib-sib com-
munication as well as the evolution of proto-language.
This study will be carried out in wild barn owls. One
or two PhD-positions depending on the applicants.
(2) The second project investigates the proximate
and ultimate mechanisms of the adaptive function of
melanin-based colour traits. Although the expression
of melanic pigments is often non-condition- depen-
dent, darker wild vertebrates are more aggressive, sex-
ually active and resistant to stress than lighter indi-
viduals. We recently identiﬁed a candidate gene that
could account for covariation between the degree of
melanin-based coloration and other physiological and
behavioural traits. The aim of PhD-projects would be
to (i) determine whether variation in the products of
the candidate gene is due to a polymorphism at that
gene, diﬀerential gene expression or post-translational
modiﬁcation of the gene product, (ii) assess the adap-
tive function of variants of this candidate gene, and
(iii) identify the adaptive function of melanin- based
coloration by analysing long-term datasets and by per-
forming experimental studies with wild animals. This
study will be carried out in wild barn owls and tawny
owls. One or two PhD-positions depending on the ap-
plicants.
Applicants should have a master’s degree (or Diplom)
in biology and research experience in evolutionary bi-
ology with a strong theoretical background as well as
a good experimental approach. For the project on the
candidate gene applicants should have a good expertise
in molecular biology and lab work. Practical skills in
the work with birds (raptors) is helpful but not com-
pulsory. The successful candidates will be collaborating
with the other members of the group, which will in-
clude approximately 4 advanced research staﬀ (3 post-
docs and a professor), 5 PhD-students and a varying
number of master students. We are located in the De-
partment of Ecology and Evolution at the University of
Lausanne (Switzerland) situated on the shores of Lake
Geneva. The Department provides a pleasant and ex-
citing research environment and a strong PhD program

4 YEAR PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY
Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven (B)
A 4 year PhD position for an evolutionary biologist
is vacant at the Laboratory of Animal Diversity and
Systematics (Catholic University of Leuven) in the re-
search group of Prof. Filip Volckaert to perform a
study entitled: “Strong selection pressures and micro-
evolutionary responses in the three-spined stickleback”.
Project description: The project investigates the con-
ceptual and methodological integration of ecology and
evolutionary biology. The successful candidate will
study the evolutionary response of the three-spined
stickleback to strong selection pressures (predation and
parasitism) in an ecological context. Patterns of phe-
notypic variation will be explored in natural popula-
tions and phenotypic adaptation tested experimentally.
The rapid evolutionary response at the genomic level
will subsequently be studied under natural and exper-
imental conditions. The stickleback is a prime model
for evolutionary research with access to an impressive
molecular toolbox, enabling the understanding of the
link between phenotypic and genomic responses to en-
vironmental and anthropogenic factors. Evolution in
sticklebacks has been studied in our team over the past
ﬁve years (Raeymaekers et al. 2005 and 2007, Molec-
ular Ecology; Raeymaekers et al. 2008, Evolutionary
Applications). The project starts on 1 October 2008
and is supervised by prof. Filip Volckaert and dr. Joost
Raeymaekers.
The research team: The Fish Genetics Team has a
strong expertise in phenotypic, neutral and adaptive
evolution, including ﬁeld monitoring, experimental de-
sign, medium-throughput genotyping, the analysis of
genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data with up-to-
date statistical approaches, and modeling for heuris-
tic and operational analyses. Topics addressed in-
clude phylogeny, barcoding, phylogeography, the study
of hybridisation, population genetics, local adaptationand rapid evolution (natural and ﬁsheries induced),
enhanced selection in aquaculture (aquaculture ge-
nomics), bioinformatics, co-evolution between host and
parasite, spatio-temporal dynamics of nursery grounds
and the sustainable management of aquatic habitats.
Our team comprises 6 PhD students, 4 postdocs, 2
technicians and a team leader. The historic KULeu-
ven, founded in 1425, has a very stimulating research
environment. The modern city of Leuven with its me-
dieval roots oﬀers a high quality of life.
Candidate proﬁle: Strong motivation, background in
evolutionary biology, interest or experience in ﬁeld
based experimental research, open to international con-
tacts with other research groups, is strongly recom-
mended. Research will be carried out in collabora-
tion with a multidisciplinary team of ecologists, par-
asitologists, evolutionary biologists and population ge-
neticists. Importantly, this position is only vacant for
prospective students ﬂuent in the Dutch language.
Financing: The successful candidates fellowship (ap-
proximately 1600 / month netto) is funded by a na-
tional project of excellence granted by the KULeuven
(GOA). The candidate is expected to apply for a na-
tional IWT fellowship by September 2008.
Application deadline: Please send a letter of moti-
vation, C.V., and two letters of reference to Filip

Institute of Genetics and Evolution, University of
Montpellier, France
A 3 year PhD position is available in our laboratory
to work on coevolutionary dynamics in spatially andJune 2, 2008 EvolDir 27
environmentally heterogeneous systems.
How do organisms adapt to stressful conditions and
what are the implications of spatial heterogeneity
in stress for tightly-coupled interactions with other
species? The thesis will address these basic questions
and a suite of more detailed unknowns through experi-
mental investigations of microbial host-parasite associ-
ations involving Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens and its lytic
bacteriophage. The exciting prospect of this research
is demonstrating how limits to adaptation in bacterial
hosts and their coevolving parasites create pattern in
diversity, life-history tradeoﬀs, and generative mecha-
nisms of diversity such as mutation rates.
The starting date of the position is October 1st, 2008,
is open to all nationalities, and knowledge of the French
language is not a requirement. The salary is approxi-
mately 1750 euros/month.
The successful candidate will have a Masters degree
with training in evolutionary biology, and preferably
have experience in microbiology or experimental evolu-
tion. Interested candidates should send a letter of mo-
tivation, CV, and the contact details of two references
to Dr. Michael Hochberg (mhochber@univ-montp2.fr)
no later than the 20th of May. Contacts for additional
information on the project are welcome.

PhD-position in Animal Ecology at the department of
Ecology & Evolution, EBC, Uppsala:
Multimodal sexual signaling and the evolution of ani-
mal mating systems under environmental perturbation
A 4-year PhD position is available on a project inves-
tigating the evolution of signaling under various envi-
ronmental regimes, and how signaling constraints may
aﬀect sexual selection and mating systems in pipeﬁshes.
The project aims to characterize the genetic mating
systems and the intensity of sexual selection in exper-
imental populations of pipeﬁsh under various environ-
mental treatments. A second goal of the project is to
explore the eﬀects of various sensory modalities such
as visual, olfactory and auditory cues. The study or-
ganisms are the deep-snouted pipeﬁsh (Syngnathus ty-
phle), the straight-nose pipeﬁsh (Nerophis ophidion)
and the snake pipeﬁsh (Entelurus aequoreus). These
three marine species are sex-role reversed, i.e., females
compete more intensively for mating opportunities for
males. Females likely rely on multiple cues to commu-
nicate with males and to compete with other females
in order to increase their mating success.
An explosive growth of ﬁlamentous algae following eu-
trophication in our waters increases water turbidity and
reduces visibility. Consequently, sexual selection on vi-
sual signals (such as pipeﬁsh ornaments and courtship
behaviour) may be impaired, and females may be forced
to use other signals such as chemical or auditory ones.28 EvolDir June 2, 2008
The project aims to investigate such alternative signals.
Moreover, we and others have noted a sudden dramatic
increase in population density of the snake pipeﬁsh En-
telurus aequoreus, presumably due to a general rise in
water temperatures. This makes it important to test
predictions about population density and the intensity
of sexual selection to assess unexpected consequences
from climate change. This part of the project has spe-
ciﬁc relevance for biodiversity research.
The long-term goal of the project is to understand
how ecological factors and environmental perturbation
may shape mating systems and alter sexual selection
and to understand the relative contributions of signal-
ing modalities to the sexual selection process. The
project will consist of ﬁeld work at Kristineberg Ma-
rine Research Station, Fiskeb¨ ackskil, along with molec-
ular analysis in Trondheim, Norway and College Sta-
tion, Texas, and data analysis in the Uppsala de-
partment. The Department of Ecology and Evolu-
tion/Animal Ecology has an active and successful grad-
uate student program. The close links with other de-
partments within the Evolutionary Biology Centre of-
fers excellent possibilities for interdisciplinary research
in evolutionary biology. The PhD project is part of
a Science Research Council project on mating systems
and sexual selection in sex-role reversed pipeﬁsh, in col-
laboration with Norwegian and US researchers.
The successful candidate should have a degree (240
Swedish academic credits worth of courses with at least
60 academic credits) at the advanced level or the equiv-
alent (for instance if acquired abroad)) in biology. The
project is suitable for someone with a strong interest in
sexual selection and sexual signaling and the link be-
tween these processes and mating systems. We consider
previous experience in laboratory experiments, statis-
tical analysis of such data, ﬁeld work and particularly
experience in such work on ﬁshes as an advantage. We
place emphasis on personal suitability. We expect can-
didates to work in a group as well as independently
and have good organizational skills. Applicants are
obliged to participate in an organized PhD training pro-
gram. Strong English communicative skills are a must.
Salary follows the guidelines from Uppsala University
(rising from approximately 15000-22000 SEK/month in
4 years).
How to apply: Please e-mail a statement of inter-

Gene and protein networks related to breast cancer
Systems biology is a growing area, combining modelling
and computational analysis with biological experimen-
tation. It enables us to understand biological processes
on a broad-scale like never before: for example, in-
stead of analysing a gene or its protein in isolation, we
now analyse entire networks. Such systems level under-
standing impacts research in multiple areas, including
cancer biology.
In this studentship, you will examine gene and protein
regulatory networks related to breast cancer. You will
both build computational models and perform biolog-
ical experiments. The project will lever two systems
biology methods-dynamical systems modelling (DSM)
of large cellular networks and Bayesian network (BN)
inference of network structure-to produce data-driven
models of gene and protein regulation networks rel-
evant to breast cancer. DSM handles well the spar-
sity of data; however, networks are manually describedJune 2, 2008 EvolDir 29
and uniqueness is diﬃcult to verify. BNs complement
this by recovering network structure de novo from data
and predicting several alternative structures; however,
they have high data demands. You will use these two
complementary methods to suggest structures consis-
tent with the data and to identify the key experiments
required to discriminate between alternative solutions.
You will be based at St Andrews University and jointly
supervised by Dr V Anne Smith (St Andrews), Prof
John W Crawford (Abertay), and Prof David J Har-
rison (Edinburgh). Dr Smith will provide expertise
on BNs; Prof Crawford and Prof Harrsion will pro-
vide expertise on DSM and biological experimenta-
tion respectively. As a SULSA Student, you will
also have the opportunity to engage in the SULSA

UTubingen EvolutionaryGenetics
PhD position in evolutionary genetics
Topic: Genetic architecture of natural variation in
pathogen defence
The PhD project is concerned with a comprehensive
genetic analysis of the natural variation in resistance
against pathogens. It aims at obtaining fundamental
knowledge as to the evolution of host defences in na-
ture. The project relies on a unique model system,
consisting of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a
host and various bacteria as pathogens. The results are
expected to have an impact on three biological research
themes that are of particular current interest: the ani-
mal innate immune system, behavioural defences, and
the evolution of the genetic architecture of complextraits.
The project is supervised by Dr. Hinrich Schulenburg
(currently University T¨ ubingen, Germany, but moving
to Kiel University, Germany, in autumn 2008) and Dr.
Jan Kammenga (Wageningen University, The Nether-
lands). It is funded by the German Science Founda-
tion (SCHU 1415/6-1). The project will be based at
the new Department for Animal Evolutionary Ecology
at Kiel University, Germany, while some important ex-
periments will be performed in Wageningen. Both labs
are active in various ﬁelds of evolutionary ecology and
provide an international and interactive atmosphere.
Requirements for the position: High motivation, ex-
cellent background in either evolutionary genetics or
immunology, knowledge of basic molecular techniques
(PCR, fragment analysis), handling of complex experi-
mental set-up, statistics, teamwork, ideally some expe-
rience with C. elegans or bacteria, ﬂuency in English.
Please email me your application as a single merged
pdf-ﬁle including CV, a one-page summary of research
interests, and two references from senior scientists.
Deadline for applications: 9 June 2008. Start of posi-
tion: Aug/Sept 2008. Women are especially encouraged
to apply. Severely handicapped people will be prefer-
entially considered in case of equivalent qualiﬁcations.

TITLE: LEMMING IMPACT ON THE TUNDRA; IN-
STRUCTOR: LAURI OKSANEN
There has been a major lemming outbreak on the
mainland tundra of northernmost Norway, especially at30 EvolDir June 2, 2008
higher altitudes. As shown by the graphs below, small
rodent dynamics have been entirely diﬀerent above and
below the 500 m contour. The lemmings have now
crashed but for a plant evolutionist, the fun has just
begun. Last year, we made tens of rodent exclosures
in diﬀerent habitats, from a productive birch forest on
a south facing mountain slope to unproductive heaths
and snow-beds at higher altitudes. The composition of
the vegetation was studied in exclosures and on open
plots, using the point frequency method. Similar veg-
etation studies were also made on islands of Ie ˚Aj˜Avri.
Four islands (within red circles in the attached satellite
image) have lemming exclosures but are otherwise ac-
cessible and have had gray-sided voles since 1991. Four
islands have been kept lemming free. We can thus study
the impacts of lemmings making comparisons both be-
tween and within islands. The isl ands also allow us to
study processes, which require larger spatial scale, e.g.
impacts of lemmings on nutrient cycling and sexual re-
production of plants.
To exploit this unique situation, I want to hire two
plant evolutionist. Candidates from master’s level (pro
gradu, examensarbete, hovudfag) to post doc level are
considered. Funding is, however, guaranteed for this
year only; applications for 2009-11 are pending. The
Finnish masters & PhD student’s stipendium is 1313
per month (tax free); the post doc stipendium is 1700.
Besides basic evolution training, the successful appli-
cant should have mental readiness to work in harsh
conditions. Previous experience of tundra/mountain
nature is an advantage. A detailed project descrip-
tion is found on my homepage ( http://users.utu.ﬁ/-
lauoks/2008-suunnitelma ). My homepage also contains
information concerning the sites. The successful candi-
date is expected to start working in the project from
10.07.2008
applications with CV and list of publications should be
mailed to: lauoks@utu.ﬁ by 30.5. 2008. Decision will
be announced within a week

These projects integrate statistical, ecogeographic, and
genetic expertise at an exciting time when biology is in-
creasingly realising the power of ecology and statistics
to make sense of it. The projects centre on genetics for
management of biodiversity.
Project 1: The use of GIS and molecular data for the
ultimate beneﬁt of farmers and conservation. We have
used Geography Information Systems and molecular
markers to maximise diversity within plant germplasm
collections. The PhD would further develop this
methodology (core collection concept) and apply it to
a large existing collection of one of the most important
pasture plants in Australia (subterranean clover).
Project 2: Detection of genomic regions under selec-
tion. We are using Geography Information Systems and
molecular markers to identify genomic regions adapting
to environmental change. The PhD will develop these
methods in subterranean clover and red clover in collab-
oration with Kazusa DNA Research Institute in Japan.
Visits to Japan would be likely.
Project 3: Genetic monitoring of disease resistance
in clover. This program will use existing and new
microsatellite DNA to compare red and subterranean
clovers, and develop QTL maps. The project provides
the opportunity for ﬁeldwork at various locations in
WA.
Project 4: Genetics of ﬂowering time in clover. At UWA
and Murdoch University we are interested in the genet-
ics of ﬂowering time. The PhD student will use data
obtained from our two mapping populations of subter-
ranean clover in existing or novel programs to map the
ﬂowering time QTLs. There would be ﬁeldwork too.
Requirments: BSc (Hons1), Masters, or equivalent, in
biostatistics, molecular biology, population genetics, or
molecular ecology. Solid research and communication

UZurich DroughtAdaptation
*Master project*

*Drought adaptation in a Cape species rich genus*
* *
The Cape ﬂora is a biodiversity hotspot, with more
than 10000 plant species in 90000 km ^2 . The mas-
sive speciation that generated this huge diversity was
probably associated with a change in the climate from
a wet, all-year rainfall system to summer droughts.
/ /
/Phylica /(Rhamnaceae), one of the typical fynbos ele-
ments, is with ca. 150 species is one of the fastest radi-
ating clades in the Cape ﬂora. The genus has very dis-
tinctive leaves, these vary from broad in species found
in wetter environments, to hard, narrow and revolute in
species more associated with drought. The leaves may
reﬂect a set of drought adaptations.
We will use GIS (geographic information system) to
model the drought to which each species is associated.
We will also investigate the structure and function of
the leaves to locate speciﬁc drought adaptations. We
will use these to test the hypothesis that the leaves are32 EvolDir June 2, 2008
indeed drought adaptated, and that they determine the
niches which the species can occupy.
We will do extensive ﬁeldwork in the Cape region dur-
ing the southern spring of 2008 (September to Decem-
ber). Ecological data on the growth form, leaves inser-
tion and pubescence (leaves and stem) will be recorded,
together with habitat data. The work will be based at
the University of Cape Town.

Accelrys petition followup 3
Hi all -
I would like to oﬀer my apology to Accelrys and its em-
ployees for suggesting that the company would not fol-
low through on their commitment to supply non-node-
locked, non-expiring license keys to all current GCG
custyomers with “perpetual” licenses. As I mentioned
in my last posting Accelrys is now involved in that pro-
cess and I have received my new key. It was never myintent to discredit Accelrys, nor its employess. I merely
had not been informed that the process was underway.
I am sorry that I miswrote and hope that any hard
feelings can be overcome. Thank you.

Antiviral defence genes
Dear all,
I am compiling a list of genes that are speciﬁcally im-
portant for the defence against viruses at any point of
infection in any vertebrate (or even animal) system. I
hope to get an exhaustive list of gene names, (proposed)
function(s) and source DNA sequences.
If you could give me any hint, names, publications or
whatever I would be very happy to get into contact with
you.
Cheers, Robert

Antiviral defence genes answers
Dear all,
some time ago I asked the community for info about
genes that are important for animal, or more speciﬁ-
cally, vertebrate immmune defense vs. (RNA) viruses.
First of all, there is a huge variety of “candidates” of
genes and mechanisms but only few are studied in con-
text of natural variation. Moreover there is no synthe-
sizing work on that issue. For ﬁelds like evolutionary
genetics, ecological immunity or host-pathogen biology
it would be highly interesting, though, to sum up the
current knowledge from some model systems, and use
this info in non-model systems.
I personally think it is worth while writing a review on
that issue and publishing it to the scientiﬁc commu-
nity. If there is interest in this action by some of you
who feel experienced in these issues please le me know
(robert.kraus@wur.nl).
For now, here is a condensed list of suggestions that
I got. All of these are suggested to be starting points.
The actual screening of the literature may be some nice
work of its own (see comment on the need for a proper
review above...):- RNAi http://www.current-biology.com/content/-

A search trough Pubmed and Web of science should pull
functional infection/expression, association and knock-
out studies. Genome websites/databases will be yet
another good resource. Although this is an exhaustive
eﬀort, there will still be many player left out because
we simply do not know a majority of the genes that are
involved in viral infection and progression. An interest-
ing point is that, some genes (such as mitochondrial and
other energy metabolism genes) which expected to have
no anti viral properties show up as important players
depending on the type of viral infection.

Hello,
I am an undergraduate student attending the Evolution

rebeccavanderhooft@gmail.comEvolution Intro course
Dear All,
I am going to teach part of an introductory course on
Evolution to ﬁrst year biology students after the sum-
mer break, thus I am starting to gather ideas for dis-
cussion sessions. I thought it might be appealing for
students to watch movies that either introduce or dis-
cuss evolutionary ideas, especially if they are tangibly
relevant to their every day life or to society in general.
I thought of showing them Flock of Dodos, for exam-
ple, but, upon viewing it a second time, I realized that
it would not be appropriate for a group of European
(primarily Swiss) students, because it’s too US-based.
Does anybody have other suggestions for movies about
evolution (theory, biology, case studies, society, etc...)
that might stir discussion for beginning undergradu-
ates?
Than you very much for any input on this question.

Facebook evolution simulation
I’ve created a Facebook application that may interest
many readers of EvolDir. It’s called Evarium, and it
places an animated simulation of evolution with sexual
selection, sexual conﬂict, mutation, and genetic drift
on your Facebook proﬁle page. You can learn more
about it at http://evarium.com/ . If you’re logged in
as a Facebook user, you can also install Evarium from
that page.
Facebook is used by tens of millions of high school and
college students, so Evarium may be of particular inter-
est to teachers of high school or college courses featuring
evolution. However, Evarium isn’t meant as a pedagog-
ical tool comparable to, for example, EvoBeaker. It’s
best described as an educational toy, mostly fun but
potentially instructive as well. At present, it’s avail-
able on Facebook only, but if time allows, I’ll bring it
to MySpace and some other platforms.

Genemapper and Vista
Dear colleagues,
I’m seeking to install Genemapper (v 3.7) on my com-

dows Vista operating system (Home Premium).
I’m failing at the ﬁrst hurdle as the Genemapper in-
staller tells me:
* You have to logon to the local machine to installGenemapper software. * Genemapper software requires
Service Pack 1 or higher on a Windows XP Operating
Systems.
I’m running a new computer so hardware requirements
are all met, I’m logged on to my “local machine”.
Has anyone out there actually managed to install and
run Genemapper under a Vista operating system? If
so, could you please point me on the right path?

Interspecies competition
Dear Evoldir members,
I am teaching an ecology course for undergraduate stu-
dents in Biology. I am trying to set up either a ﬁeld or
a lab experiment addressing the issue of inter-species
competition. Approximately 120-160 students are at-
tending this course each semester and therefore it is
quite hard to set up an experiment for all these stu-
dents. I am wondering if anyone of you could sug-
gest something that is duable for such a big audience.
Thank you in advance. All the suggestions will be
posted to Evoldir.

Interspecies competition answers
Dear EvolDir members,
A few days ago I posted a question in EvolDir regarding
“Suggestions for inter-species competition experiment”.
Many of you replied and made very useful suggestions.
I am posting these replies since I consider they will be
of use to many of you. I would like to thank all those
that replied, I think I now have a good idea of how to
se up some experiments both in the ﬁeld and in the lab.
Thanks a lot.

Hello,
We are doing this kind of teaching here in Montpel-
lier with around 100 students. We are using Chlamy-
domonas for that purpose. It grows fast, does not re-
quire sterile equipment and you can order many diﬀer-
ent strains from the web.
We have two sets of experiments, one where students
measure the outcome of competition between a strain
of Chlamydomonas and Klebsormidium sp. (another
algae that we isolated from a soil sample) and a second
set where they study competition between two strains
of Chlamydomonas, the wild type one (CC125) and one
that resists to an herbicide (strain CC2473 that resists
to atrazine). The ﬁrst experiment focus on interspe-
ciﬁc competition while the second is designed to study
natural selection.
The way we organize this is that, for each experiment,
small groups of 4-5 students run a single replicate of
each treatment. We then pool all results (using a web
interface) and all students have to analyze the com-
plete data set. The most interesting part of this is that
most of the time some aspects of the experiment fail.June 2, 2008 EvolDir 55
Students have to deal with that and must also cope
with heterogeneity in data. I think these issues are re-
aly central in educating students to scientiﬁc thinking.
And still, students seldom face these problems in the
context of a class.
If you want more details on these experiments, feel
free to ask! On the web-site from which you can or-
der the strains ( http://www.chlamy.org ), you will also
ﬁnd some teaching kits, I think. I never used these, but
it might proove useful in your case.

Hello, Our department has an undergraduate ecology
lab that focuses on competitive exclusion, using
spider species as the study organisms. Students
measure web diameter, angle, distance from ground,
and an approximation of strand density. They use
chi-square and we encourage them to test between
ecologically similar species (e.g. between two dif-
ferent orb weavers). I can email you a .pdf of
the lab if you like. Good luck! Jen Hamel ja-

Hello, I teach an undergraduate ecology class, and use
a great set of software called EcoBeaker (SimBiotic
Software: http://www.ecobeaker.com/ ) to help teach
a number of ecological concepts. The simulation soft-
ware is very easy to use, the directions are clear, and the
labs are visually appealing. There is often some con-
trol over the options if you want to play around, and
students can output data and graphs for further anal-
ysis. They also provide full lab exercises, with good
questions, to go along with each lab. I’ve had a very
good experience with this program, and its compan-ion, EvoBeaker. I realize this isn’t a ﬁeld or laboratory
demonstration per se, but it may be appropriate for
such a large class. Cheers, Maarten Vonhof Assistant

LondonZoo 6 VolResearchAssist
Would you be interested in working on an exciting re-
search project at London Zoo?
We are looking for up to 6 volunteers to assist on a
project looking at coordination in human groups from
the 20th July to 14th September.
This project uses RFID (radio frequency identiﬁcation
technology) to examine how language might promote
coordination in human groups. Traditionally, research
on the conﬂict between cooperation and competition
has focussed on pairs acting for personal gain (e.g. pris-
oner’s dilemma). However, our global ecological suc-
cess depends largely on cooperation in groups. Within
groups individuals act fundamentally selﬁshly but can
pursue a common goal from which all members bene-
ﬁt, requiring coordination. The complexity of human
coordination might stem from our ability to combine
theory of mind with vocal communication. The experi-
ment will be held at ZSL London Zoo and participants
will be zoo visitors.
Volunteering would require your presence at London
Zoo for a minimum of 3 days per week.56 EvolDir June 2, 2008
Please direct any enquiries to Claire Narraway
(Claire.narraway@zsl.org) with a copy of your CV and

Migrate problems
Dear colleagues,
I am actually trying to get estimations of migration
rates (based on mitochondrial gene and nuclear mi-
crosatellite) between 6 species of ﬁsh using the program
Migrate. But I am facing two problems:
(1) Based on a mitochondrial gene, I get clear signatureof introgression between two non reproductively iso-
lated species while some species are completely isolated.
In opposite, based on microsatellite data (13 loci) the
gene ﬂow between all the species appear to be the same
(around 1 migrant per generation). Other methods like
genetic distance calculations and assignment methods
show signiﬁcant genetic diﬀerence between species and
the same signal of introgression between two species
(same as based on mitochondrial DNA). The 13 mi-
crosatellites are highly polymorphic (10 to 30 alleles)
and all species have alleles in common. I have about
50 samples per species. I do not understand the incon-
sistency between methods and results... Why migrate
does not give any signal?
(2) Also, studies that uses migrate to infer migration
rates always present standard deviation in the number
of migrants between populations or species. In all my
run, if i do not change the number of short and long
chain as well as the number of recorded genealogies (i
also run multiple chain at diﬀerent temperatures), the
values of numbers of migrants doe not change at all! As
I increase the length of the run, the values remain sta-
ble. Is the commonly presented uncertainty related to
diﬀerence between runs that use diﬀerent parameters?
I am greatfull to all for any explanation,
Cheers,
Matt

Msvar update problems
Dear All
I have been trying to run the latest version of msvar
(update 1.3) but the program consistently shows error
messages when a single locus (init vﬁle too short) or
multiple loci are run. I have prepared all the ﬁles as
per the instructions in the read me ﬁle. I haven’t come
across very many recent papers that have used the new
version of the program. If someone has expertise in
running the program, could you please let me know
and I can send you some of my ﬁles for your comments.
Thank you.regards

PAUP and OSXLeopard
As you know the Mac version of PAUP* currently re-
quires either Mac OS 9, or Mac OS X with Classic
installed. However many users have upgraded to new
Mac OS X Leopard, that means they no longer have
the graphic interface anymore. I have found a commer-
cial software called Geneious that can support current
version of PAUP*, which means you can run PAUP*
within this commercial software with a nice graphic in-
terface. Geneious itself is written by JAVA so it is cross
platforms, any operating system can run it.
PAUP* users can download Geneious for free and
Geneious oﬀers a 2 weeks trails.
I believe this is helpful for some evolutionary biologists.

Peter Moens
It is with great personal sadness that I report the pass-
ing of Prof. Peter Moens.
Peter was a professor at York University in Toronto.
Those who knew him can attest to his ﬁre and vigor
in all things scientiﬁc. In addition to becoming famous
for his work on chromosome dynamics and synatonemal
complexes he volunteered much of his time to the com-
munity and was the managing editor of GENOME (the
Canadian journal for genetics research) for 25 years. He
was a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.
A memorial gathering will be held on Friday May 2nd,58 EvolDir June 2, 2008
2008 from 7-10 pm at the 3rd ﬂoor lounge of the Lum-
bers Building, York University, Toronto.
A good friend to genetics and evolutionary biology in
Canada.

Phenoscape
Dear Colleague:
We have created a new ’Friends of Phenoscape’ dis-
cussion and announcement list and would like to
invite you to join at the following URL: https:/-
/lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/phenoscape-discuss
As you may be aware, the Phenoscape project ( http:/-
/phenoscape.org ) was funded by NSF-DBI and sup-
ported by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
(NESCent, http://nescent.org ) to develop the ﬁrst in-
formatics system to integrate evolutionary, anatomical,
developmental, and genetics data. We are prototyping
this approach with ostariophysan ﬁsh morphology in
relation to zebraﬁsh phenotypes, and in the past year
we have made a number of technical and conceptual
advances in using ontologies in the context of evolu-
tionary biology. These include the development of a
multispecies ontology (Teleost Anatomy), a taxonomy
ontology (Teleost Taxonomy), a curatorial interface for
curating characters (Phenote), evidence codes to reﬂect
homology, and considerable discussion and syntheses of
how to computationally relate these data. Phenoscape
will serve the broad community of comparative evolu-
tionary and developmental morphologists by providing
web-based access to integrated information and will fos-
ter new discoveries at the interface between evolution
and developmental genetics.
Our discussions to date have been within the NCBO
community and our project group. The purpose of this
mailing list is to open up our discussion of issues, be-
cause many are of general interest to comparative evolu-
tionary and developmental biologists. Our goals, which
include development of the most generalizable tools and
approaches, require broad participation, and we would
like to have you join us.
We would also like to use the opportunity to pointyou to our project blog at http://blog.phenoscape.org/-
,where we will summarize topical discussions from
this list along with other announcements. Instead
of regularly checking the site for updates, you may
also use your favorite newsreader or news aggregator
(such as Safari, NetNewsWire, Google Reader, and
many more) to belong to our news feed at http://-
blog.phenoscape.org/feed/, and your newsreader will
automatically alert you to new posts.
We welcome your participation.

PopulationGenetics data
Hello EvolDir readers:
I am conducting a meta-analysis of population genetic
data (SSR, AFLP, RFLP, etc.) to test for correlations
between variation within populations and environmen-
tal heterogeneity in the region surrounding each pop-
ulation. The hypothesis is based upon the following
logic:
- Heterogeneous environments should favour local adap-
tation and divergence between populations - Gene
ﬂow between populations should mix alleles - Popu-
lations inhabiting heterogeneous environments should
have higher levels of genetic variation due to the com-
bined action of gene ﬂow and heterogeneous selection
We found evidence for this pattern in a quantitative
trait in lodgepole pine (Yeaman and Jarvis 2006) and
suspect that it may also occur with molecular markers
because of either direct selection or linkage to selected
loci.
We are looking for any studies that have measured vari-
ation in molecular markers for at least 7 populations
with the following characteristics:
- Terrestrial organism - ’wild’ species (non-pest/non-
agricultural) - Not a recent colonization/invasion - In-
dividuals within each population sampled over a small
range relative to the distance between populations (ex-
ample: population radius of 1km, >10 km separating
populations). - No fewer than 5 individuals sampled in
any population; mean of >10 individuals per popula-June 2, 2008 EvolDir 59
tion. - Geographical coordinates (Lat/Long or UTM)
available for each population
If you are willing to share data from a study that ﬁts
these characteristics, please contact Sam Yeaman at
’yeaman@zoology.ubc.ca’. We are reviewing relevant
literature but want to make sure we don’t miss any
useful datasets.

Population genetics simulation
software
Hi, all,
Can anybody suggest a software package for individ-
ual based metapopulation genetics simulation of diploid
organisms under diﬀerent population sizes, migration
rates, migration models and extinction-recolonisation
rates. The program should be able to output genetic
parameters at every generation (or every ten-hundred
generations). Easypop does not seem to have an option
of incorporating extinction-recolonisations.
Thanks Asta

with up to 256 alleles * Autosomal, X, Y chromo-
somes and mitochondrial * KAM and stepwise muta-
tion regime
Input ====* Graphic interface for the patch topology.
* Inter-patch environment compatible with GIS Idrisi
and Biomapper format * User-friendly interface for the
deﬁnition of the life-cycle * Batch mode for sensitiv-

qPCR system suggestions
Dear All: I’m part of a small, but diverse, group of re-60 EvolDir June 2, 2008
searchers looking to purchase a qPCR system for gene
expression analysis, SNP genotyping, etc. The group
ranges from no to moderate experience with qPCR. We
are considering Biorad, Stragene, Applied Biosystems
and Eppendorf systems, but would appreciate any sug-
gestions/comments from labs that have a system that
they would - or would not - recommend. We are looking
for a 96 well format system, in the $30-50k range, that
would be user-friendly for a group of 4-8 grad students.
If there is any general interest in the opinions sent in,
I can post them on this list.
Any suggestions are appreciated -

Shipping Reagents Overseas
Hi All,
We are trying to conduct PCR and sequencing over-
seas in the Philippines. Although every other vendor
has been willing to ship to the Philippines, providing
our normal pricing but with added shipping costs, ABI
(hum Darth Vader’s theme here) wants to charge us 2-
3 times our normal prices, just for shipping things to
the Philippines instead of our lab in Boston. We were
quoted $77,000 for a $20,000 reagent order.
Seems to me a reasonable alternative is to bring the
reagents over ourselves. We thought of hand carrying
them, but the TSA (again, hum Darth Vader’s theme
here) can’t assure us that they won’t conﬁscate our
reagents. We thought of dry shippers, but the temper-
ature of the liquid nitrogen is too cold. We’ve thought
of FedEx or other express mail, but the 5lb of dry ice
that can be shipped on airliners will only last 48 hours,
and they can’t guarantee that the shipment will make
it in less than 72.
For some reagents (e.g. taq), we can get things locally,
although it is a bit more expensive. For things like
bigdye, we are stuck.
I’m sure we aren’t the ﬁrst people to want to ship thingsJune 2, 2008 EvolDir 61
overseas and keep them cold. Does anyone out there
have any ideas? I’m running out of ideas.

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
I have just uploaded a new version of DAMBE
(5.0.15) at DAMBE’s release site: http://-
dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/dambe.asp Major updates
include:
1. A special Protein maximum likelihood method for
phylogenetic analysis of highly diverged taxa. The im-
plementation is similar to that of Rodriguez-Ezpeleta,
N., H. Brinkmann, G. Burger, A. J. Roger, M. W. Gray,
H. Philippe, and B. F. Lang. 2007. Toward resolv-
ing the eukaryotic tree: the phylogenetic positions of
jakobids and cercozoans. Curr Biol 17:1420-1425. The
amino acids are coded into four categories:
Small polar: S C T N D Large polar: Q E K R H Y W
Small nonpolar: P A G V Large nonpolar: I L M F
As one would expect, such a recoding will not go well
with recently diverged taxa, but appears to work well
with highly diverged taxa.
To access the function, read in a ﬁle with aligned
amino acid sequences into DAMBE (or protein-codingnucleotide sequences to be translated into amino
acid sequences in DAMBE), and click the menu
“Phylogenetics |Maximum likelihood |ProtML for highly
diverged seqs”. A dialog will be presented for you to
set tree-searching options or set number of resamples
for bootstrap or jackknife.
2. DNDML+: This new function combines the strength
of tree-search in fastDNAML with the richness of sub-
stitution models in PAML’s BASEML. A compromise
is made to speed up the computation, i.e., the param-
eters and topology are not estimated simultaneously.
The function ﬁrst does a quick tree, then estimate the
parameters using the tree, then use the ﬁxed parame-
ters to search tree, ......
To access the function, click the menu
“Phylogenetics |Maximum likelihood |DNAML+”.
A dialog will ensue for you to choose substitution
models and set tree-searching options.
3. The sequence editor is revised. The sequence align-
ment editor in previous versions was designed to edit
sequences of unlimited length. However, switching se-
quence segments in and out the display window causes
problems. This new version limits the sequence length
to 32767 which should be alright in most cases.
4. I have added neXML ( http://www.nexml.org ) sup-
port. This function requires you to install Microsoft’s
MSXML6.msi which is linked next to the DAMBE in-
stallation page. You should install this ﬁrst before in-
stalling DAMBE. If you do not install MSXML6.msi,
you will receive an error during DAMBE installation
which you may ignore. Everything should be as usual
except that neXML support would be missing.
For saving sequences in neXML format, just click
“File|Save/convert sequence format”. In the ensuing
dialog box, click the “Save as type” dropdown box.
You will ﬁnd many diﬀerent sequence formats, such as
MEGA, PHYLIP, PAUP, PAML, etc., with neXML be-
ing the last one.
For reading sequences in neXML format, just click
“File|Open standard sequence ﬁle”. In the next dialog
box, click the “File of type” dropdown box. You will
ﬁnd many diﬀerent sequence formats such as MEGA,
PHYLIP, PAUP, PAML, etc., with neXML being the
fourth from the bottom.
You can also read and save trees as well as non-sequence
data in neXML formats.
Eventually I hope that I will only need to support the
neXML format, although I know that stabilizing selec-
tion in favour of neXML format is still pretty weak.
neXML is still an evolving project and there are other62 EvolDir June 2, 2008
alternative XML speciﬁcations for phylogenetics. For
the time being, neXML seems to make sense to me.
(There is no VISTA version yet as I have not yet in-
stalled VISTA on any of my computers. Heard that
the Windows after VISTA would be meaner and leaner.
Hope that it is true.)

TREEFINDER
A new unpaid TREEFINDER version is online at:
www.treeﬁnder.de TREEFINDER is a software to
compute phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.
New features are:
- mixed protein model: MIX - Dayhoﬀ groups protein
model: DG - improved model proposer
A mixed protein model MIX[B1,B2,...] is a linear
combination of empirical base models B1,B2,... with
weights that are optimized along with the tree. More
precisely, their parameter vectors are combined. The
MIX does interpolate between the base models, and
also extrapolate when weights are negative. The MIX
does often ﬁt data much better than any of its base
models alone. The user decides which and how many
models to mix, the complexity depends on the number
of models included. Given enough independent base
models, the MIX allows to model any kind of linear de-
pendency between the amino acid replacement param-
eters, and with 190 or 210 independent base models the
MIX becomes equivalent to the 20-state GTR.
The MIX does also work with 20-state RNA models.
The model proposer proposes MIX’es if they are appro-
priate.
The model proposer does now display the scores and pa-
rameters of all models tested. User-deﬁned candidate
sets are possible.
Please note that I am still not being paid for my work
and that I had no income for years. I wonder if some-
body ﬁnds TREEFINDER worth oﬀering me a com-
pensation, a wage, a position, a perspective.

Software msBayes update
Dear Evoldir-ers,June 2, 2008 EvolDir 63
The updated msBayes (v20080515) is ready for down-
load at http://msbayes.sourceforge.net/ msBayes (pro-
nounced em es bayeszz) allows complex and ﬂexible
comparative phylogeographic inference.
More speciﬁcally, you can test for simultaneous di-
vergence or colonization across multiple co-distributed
pairs of taxa (populations and/or species). It uses hier-
archical approximate Bayesian computation (HABC) to
estimate hyper-parameters given DNA sequence data.
The HABC algorithm uses a ﬁnite sites version of ms,
the classic coalescent simulator written by Dick Hud-
son.
The hierarchical model incorporates uncertainty into
each set of taxon- pair demographic parameters (sub-
parameters) while estimating hyper- parameters that
characterize the congruence in divergence/colonization
times across the co-distributed taxon-pairs.
Sub-parameters include:
post-divergence migration rates ancestral popu-
lation sizes descendent population sizes popula-
tion size change parameters recombination Diver-
gence/colonization times
New features:
One can run a constrained analysis where the number
of diﬀerent divergence times (PSI) is ﬁxed to any user-
deﬁned value. In this case, additional hyper-parameters
are estimated. For example, after running an initial
unconstrained analysis, one can subsequently run an
analysis where the number of diﬀerent divergence times
(PSI) is ﬁxed to the estimate from the initial uncon-
strained analysis. In this constrained, analysis, each
of these PSI times are estimated as are the number
of taxon-pairs that were split at each of these PSI
times. One can use a greatly expanded set of sum-
mary statistics for the HABC acceptance/rejection al-
gorithm. This includes four measures of Shannons al-
lelic diversity Index as well as sub-population measure-
ments of various pair-wise diﬀerences metrics and num-
ber of segregating sites metrics. Automatic calculation
of Bayes factors that quantify posterior support for
hyper-parameter values Can constrain any taxon-pair
sub-parameters to any user-deﬁned value Can convert
estimates of mean divergence times into Earth years
Allows at least a 10-fold higher number of Hyper-prior
simulations (draws) Improved error checking such as
identifying when local linear regression fails
Down the road: multi-locus msBayes
msBayes runs on Linux, Mac OS-X, and most POSIX
systems. Although you need to use command line in-
terface, it is fairly simple. msBayes is written in perl,C, and R. msBayes is released under the GNU Public
License.

SouthAfrica Volunteers
SmallMammals
Volunteer needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Evolution of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
>From September onwards
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working conditions
will await applicants, as the study species gets up
with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and stops
its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld
will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
750 (around 65 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
170 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 250 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: Currently we are looking for one
volunteer to start middle of August, two volunteers to
start beginning of September and two to star begin-
ning of December. Volunteers are expected to stay at
least 2 months, but longer periods of up to 6months are
preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch.

SSESSB Diversity call for mentors
Approximately 20 undergraduates will be participating
in the NSF- and NESCent-supported Undergraduate
Diversity at SSE/SSB program. This program, which
brings students to the annual Evolution meeting, has
been running continuously since 2003.
An important component of the program is the mentor-
ing that students receive from graduate students, post-
docs and faculty. Several have already volunteered to
serve as mentors this year (including some who vol-
unteered in previous years), but we need about a half
dozen more. Duties will include meeting a pair of un-
dergraduates in the program, attending and demystify-
ing a day of talks with them, joining them for a meal,
introducing them to colleagues and in general befriend-
ing them in ways that show that evolutionary biology
is a welcoming discipline. No costs for travel, housing
or registration are covered.
If you are interested in serving as a mentor,
please send an email to either Rich Kliman
(rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu) or Scott Edwards (sed-
wards@fas.harvard.edu). Please also indicate your
broad ﬁeld of interest, so that we can pair you with
appropriate students. And please help spread the word
about this very rewarding activity.
Thanks! Rich

Taxonomy discussion list
The Open Biomedical Ontologies project (OBO; http:/-
/obofoundry.org ) has created a new mailing list for the
discussion of ontological representation of taxonomies
and phylogenies. The OBO Foundry supports the de-
velopment of orthogonal, interoperable reference on-
tologies for biological science.
The Phenoscape project ( http://phenoscape.org ) is
funded by NSF-BDI and supported by the NationalEvolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent; http://-
nescent.org ) to develop methods and tools for using
ontologies to integrate comparative morphological data
with mutant phenotypes of genetic model organisms.
As such we are very interested in participation from
members of the evolutionary biology community to ex-
plore how best to integrate taxonomy into an ontolog-
ical framework. Issues include proper semantics of the
relationship between taxonomic groups, and between
specimens and species.

ThermalAdaptation call for postdoc
grants
***** PERMANENT CALL FOR POST-DOC
GRANT APPLICATIONS *****
In 2006 we launched a new ESF Programme on “Ther-
mal adaptation in ectotherms: Linking life history,
physiology, behaviour and genetics” (ThermAdapt); see
http://www.esf.org/thermadapt . The Objective of
this ESF Programme is to foster a multidisciplinary
European network of scientists working on thermal
adaptation. We particularly aim to integrate research
at multiple levels of investigation, including genetics,
physiology, ecology, behaviour or theory. Interested
persons or groups are encouraged to join our activities.
These include advertising their expertise via our web
site, and participation in various activities to be an-
nounced separately and regularly over the next 5 years
such as workshops, training courses, short and long ex-
change grants, exchange of specimens and expertise,
sharing of facilities, and scientiﬁc collaboration of any
kind.
We PERMANENTLY call for applications for
==>Short Visit ( <15 days) and Exchange Grants (15
days - 3 months)
There is no particular deadline. Instead, submission of
grant proposals is now PERMANENTLY OPENED,

UV for sterilization
I am based in a molecular ecology laboratory and am
planning to extract DNA from and genotype modern
and museum specimens of the same species. So, obvi-
ously there is potential for cross-contamination here.
I work under a UV hood and so all my equipment issterilised under a UV crosslinker before use. I also UV
sterilise my extraction buﬀer and ddH2O, I was won-
dering if enzymes (such as proteinase K and Taq) and
other PCR reagents (i.e. dNTPs) can also be treated in
this way or would their eﬃcacy be adversely aﬀected?
Some people have suggested that as proteinase K is
so stable it should be able to withstand UV but that
dNTPs could not, others disagree!
Any suggestions?
Many thanks, Claire

sity, Atlanta, GA USA Laboratory of Dr. Nicole Ger-
ardo
There is funding available for one postdoctoral re-68 EvolDir June 2, 2008
searcher in the laboratory of Dr. Nicole Gerardo. Our
lab’s focus is on the evolutionary ecology of microbial
host-parasite interactions.
We combine molecular genetics, phylogenetics and
experimentation to study pathogens associated with
diverse insect systems. Our research is centered
on understanding how insect hosts adapt to de-
fend against pathogens and how pathogens then
adapt to overcome these host defenses. We also
study how mutualistic microbes may play a role
in defending their hosts against pathogens. Ini-
tial projects will focus largely on the interactions
of aphids, their bacterial symbionts and microbial
pathogens, though there may be opportunities to work
on fungus-growing ants and other systems as well.
For more information, go to www.biology.emory.edu/-
research/Gerardo/Gerardohome.html . The lab is
part of Emory’s Population Biology, Ecology and
Evolution program, which has a strong focus on
host-parasite interactions and disease ecology. For
more information on the program and the re-
searchers at Emory, go to: www.biomed.emory.edu/-
PROGRAM SITES/PBEE/ Candidates should have a
background in host-parasite interactions or symbioses,
as well as an interest in research combining experi-
mental and molecular approaches to understanding the
interaction of insects and their microbial communi-
ties. Background in experimental biology of insects and
or microbes, molecular ecology, and/or bioinformatics
strongly preferred. Postdocs must have strong commu-
nication skills and be willing to help with lab mainte-
nance and training of undergraduate students. If inter-
ested, please send a CV, along with a brief statement of
interests and experiences in the above-mentioned areas,

WeedPopulations
Post-doctoral fellowship: *Spatio-temporal processes
underlying the structure of weed communities*.We are looking for a highly motivated post-doctorate
associate with a solid mathematical/analytical back-
ground to join a research team on investigating the
spatio-temporal processes underlying the structure of
weed communities.
Recent studies over several European countries have
shown the dramatic decrease of the speciﬁc weed diver-
sity in industrialized agriculture over the last decades.
On the basis of extensive regional and national long-
term datasets, the post-doctorate will investigate the
mechanisms that shape weed community structure in
various crop types in France. The research will focus
on quantifying the relative importance of temporal (i.e.
crop rotations) and/or spatial (i.e. landscape structure
and fragmentation) heterogeneities on the composition
of weed communities and their associated biodiversity
value. The relative eﬀects of other mechanisms such as
environmental properties (climatic, soil, topographic),
plant functional traits and agriculture practices could
also be investigated. The post-doctorate will work in
the Biology and Management of Weeds lab, as a mem-
ber of the research unit consisting of research staﬀ,
technical assistants, Ph.D., masters and undergraduate
students and postdoctoral fellows. The lab is located
in INRA Dijon in a scientiﬁcally rich environment for
agro-ecology. The position will provide with excellent
opportunities for publications.
The post-doctorate position requires an independent
and highly motivated researcher with excellent English
writing and data analysis skills (advanced knowledge
of statistics under R platform), who has a keen inter-
est in population and community dynamics, evolution
and spatio-temporal modelling. The applicant should
have a PhD in evolution or applied statistics, and ex-
perience in theoretical and applied studies. Experience
in community evolution will be an asset.
The post is open from 1st September 2008, for one year.
It may be renewable for a second year subject to avail-
ability of funds and satisfactory performance. The po-
sition is open to all nationalities with the exception of
French citizen. PhD thesis should have been defended
less than 5 years ago. The fellowship amount is of 2000
after taxes per month (health care is included). Dijon
oﬀers the pleasant environment of the Burgundy region,
with gastronomy, historical interest and nice natural
environmental surroundings. Paris is at around 1 h 40
min by TGV train.

The research group “Evolutionary Genetics” oﬀers a
PostDoc-Position (beginning 01. August 2008) on the
’Immune gene expression in relation to parasite loads
and human impact in wildlife species’.
Infectious diseases are very strong selective pressures
that aﬄict wildlife populations. The capacity to de-
velop an immune response after exposure to antigens,
i.e. the immunocompetence, depends upon the host
immune status and is inﬂuenced by genetic and envi-
ronmental factors.
The speciﬁc goal for this position is to identify the
molecular correlates of immune challenge and pathogen
defence and to investigate diﬀerential expression of im-
mune response genes in wildlife populations via quan-
titative real-time PCR. The successful candidate will
work as part of an interdisciplinary team investigating70 EvolDir June 2, 2008
the eﬀects of human impact on parasite loads, popula-
tion dynamics and levels of neutral and adaptive genetic
variability in small mammal populations in the Mata
Atlantica/Brazil. In addition, the successful candidate
will have the opportunity to establish own externally
funded projects related to this topic.
An applicant should have a PhD degree in Biology.
Candidates must have a strong background in pop-
ulation genetics, molecular biology and evolutionary
ecology. We seek a highly motivated and scientiﬁcally
creative scientist with an excellent literature overview
and publication record in peer-reviewed journals in this
ﬁeld, ability to work independently, team work abilities,
social, organisational and good English writing skills.
Knowledge of required molecular techniques especially
in quantitative expression analyses via real-time PCR
is essential.
The position is limited to one year. The IZW is an
equal opportunity employer. Applications from women
are strongly encouraged. Preference will be given to
disabled applicants with the same qualiﬁcations.
For further information please contact Prof Dr. Simone
Sommer + 49 30 5168-315 or Sommer@izw-berlin.de
Applicants should submit a letter explaining their re-
search interests and background and particular skills for

POST-DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN EVOLU-
TIONARY BIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
ALASKA
A post-doctoral student is sought to study the evolution
and adaptive value of color polymorphism in coastrange
sculpins under the University of Alaska’s International
Polar Year program. The coastrange sculpin is a par-
ticularly well-suited species for examining adaptive re-
sponses to newly available habitat following glacial re-
treat. Sculpins colonize new habitat quickly due to
the high dispersal ability of larvae, whereas adults
tend to be relatively sedentary once established within
streams and show a strong tendency to match stream
substrate color. The project will focus on candidate
genes involved in color change and the adaptive value
of color plasticity using molecular, experimental, and
ﬁeld methods.
The position will be based in Juneau, Alaska, under the
guidance of David Tallmon and Tony Gharrett. Start
date is early September 2008. The successful applicant

(grade 6) £30,013 - £33,780 (grade 7) per annum. This
post is available at either grade 6 or grade 7 depending
upon qualiﬁcations and experience. The post is avail-
able for up to two years, starting in September 2008.
We are seeking a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant to
work on a project entitled “Leveraging the genome se-
quences of two Arabidopsis relatives for evolutionary
and ecological genomics”, funded by a grant from the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Coun-
cil, as part of an international consortium assembled
under the ERA-plant genomics initiative. The goals of
the project are to evaluate how the mating “decisions”
that plants make aﬀect their potential to respond to
environmental change, as a result of changes in genetic
diversity resulting from diﬀerent levels of inbreeding.
This project will address this question by examining
naturally occurring populations of a species that is nor-
mally outcrossing (i.e., is only able to breed with unre-
lated individuals), but for which populations have been
identiﬁed that have experienced a change in the genetic
machinery required to maintain this mating strategy.
The project will be designed to meet the overall goals
of the consortium project, which is geared towards un-
derstanding how genomic changes aﬀect adaptation in
natural plant populations.

2 POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS: VISUAL
TARGET DETECTION IN HAWAIIAN DAM-
SELFLIES and WING VEIN EVOLUTION IN
FLYING INSECTS
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII. I am seeking two highly
motivated postdocs to work on:
Visual target detection behavior, morphology, and vi-
sual performance in damselﬂies: The Hawaiian dam-
selﬂy genus Megalagrion is an endemic adaptive radia-
tion with extensive color variation and extreme ecolog-
ical diversiﬁcation in terms of breeding habitat (light
environment). Vision is important for foraging (identi-
fying insect prey), identifying sexual partners (females
are often cryptic), as well as avoiding predators. Thus,
learning the fundamental mechanisms by which these
animals with simple visual systems accomplish very dif-
ﬁcult visual tasks may have broad implications for their
ecology and evolution, in addition to possible practical
applications.
Wing Vein Evolution in Flying Insects: The material
properties of insect wings are widely believe to be con-
ferred by the structure and organization of wing veins.
We will conduct a broad-based comparative study to
quantify wing vein diversity, model how the morpho-
logical features of the veins contribute to the material
properties of the wing, and how this in turn aﬀects the
aerodynamic performance of the wing in ﬂight. Data
collected will include confocal microscopy, SEM, and
estimates of ﬂuid ﬂow via light microscopy. Morpholog-
ical data will be used to inform computational models
using genetic algorithms to “evolve” wing vein patterns
subject to “ﬁtness” imposed by aerodynamics. Models
will be validated by ﬁeld tests of wing damage and ﬂight
performance.
Candidates should have the following: Drive and mo-tivation to solve diﬃcult scientiﬁc problems. Good
communication/interpersonal skills, good experimental
skills and experience in either animal behavior, visual
or neurophysiology, or kinematic analysis using high-
speed video for postdoc 1 and candidates for postdoc
2 should have good experimental skills and experience
with microscopy, kinematic analysis using high-speed
video, or morphometrics with experience with image
analysis. Demonstrated ability to do ﬁeld and lab work.
Self-starter and creative problem-solver. Both post-
docs must have some familiarity with scientiﬁc com-
puter programming and excellent quantitative skills.
Desirable qualiﬁcations: Candidates experienced in the
R programming language and with solid data analysis
skills are preferred. Candidates interested in extending
the project to address major questions in behavior, sen-
sory physiology, or evolutionary ecology are particularly
welcome. Fabrication skills. Experience with insects a
plus.
Candidates interested in extending the project to ad-
dress major questions in behavior, sensory physiology,
or evolutionary ecology are particularly welcome.
The Butler lab is in the Department of Zoology at the
University of Hawaii, studies the evolution of morphol-
ogy from functional, structural, and adaptive (evolu-
tionary) perspectives. Other projects in the lab include:
the evolution of sexual dimorphism in lizards and dam-
selﬂies, locomotor biomechanics and the physical eﬀects
of pregnancy in lizards, opsin evolution in damselﬂies,
and direct modeling approaches to phylogenetic com-
parative methods.
We have a dynamic network of colleagues and resources
available via: the Bishop Museum, Paciﬁc Biomedical
Research Center, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology,
Kewalo Marine Laboratory, Paciﬁc Center for Emerg-
ing Infectious Diseases Research, as well as the Bekesy
Laboratory of Neurobiology.
Appointment is initially for one year, renewable for sec-
ond year based on satisfactory performance. Compet-
itive stipend. Start date ﬂexible. Positions subject to
availability of funds.
E-mail inquiries are welcome to mbutler@hawaii.edu
Applications (preferably by e-mail) should include

ButterﬂyEvolution
Job oﬀer for a postdoc at the University of Louvain-
la-Neuve (Universite catholique de Louvain, UCL, Bel-
gium):
“Behavioural evolution of butterﬂy movements: a mat-
ter of perception?”
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who could
join us for a period of 12 months starting in 2008 (exact
starting date is negotiable). We aim to develop new and
stimulating behavioural research on the signiﬁcance of
perceptual range within a context of insect dispersal in
fragmented landscapes. Butterﬂies are used as model
system for a series of experiments in the lab and in the
ﬁeld. Earlier work on speckled woods (Pararge aegeria
L.) has suggested intriguing diﬀerences in the response
distance to target habitat in individuals from continu-
ous forest and individuals from fragmented agricultural
landscape (Merckx & Van Dyck 2007. Anim. Behav.
74: 1029-1037). We want to better understand the na-
ture of environmental cues butterﬂies respond to dur-
ing traveling across the landscape matrix. Therefore
we want to develop a challenging evolutionary ecolog-
ical research program with a strong emphasis on per-
ceptual diﬀerences relative to landscape type. We will
also explore some eco-physiological aspects. Another
postdoc will also join our team to work in this ﬁeld,
so it will be a collaborative project. There will be fre-
quent interactions with the lab-members of other lines
of research. You will earn a postdoc grant from our
University (UCL).
Candidates should have excellent CV (i.e., several pub-
lications in outstanding behavioural, ecological, conser-
vation or evolutionary journals, experience with obser-
vational and experimental behavioural research). Only
researchers who have been outside Belgium for at least
the last two years can apply for this position. You
will work within a cluster of two young research teams
at the Biodiversity Research Centre of the Univer-
sit´ e catholique de Louvain (UCL) in Belgium. The
Behavioural Ecology and Conservation Group headed
by Hans Van Dyck ( www.ecol.ucl.ac.be/ecco/en ) and
the Quantitative Conservation Biology Group headed
by Nicolas Schtickzelle ( www.uclouvain.be/quant-cons-
biol). Van Dyck’s lab addresses several issues within82 EvolDir June 2, 2008
the broad ﬁeld of evolution in anthropogenic landscapes
(combining behavioural ecology, life history biology,
thermal ecology, landscape ecology and conservation).
Schtickzelle’s lab addresses conservation issues using
quantitative approaches like population viability anal-
ysis. Both labs have a common and complementary in-
terest in the process of dispersal and in resource-based
habitat approaches. Our university is in the French-
speaking part of Belgium (Louvain-la-Neuve, close to
Brussels). Lab meetings and other scientiﬁc meetings
are in English, some knowledge of French would be easy.
If you are interested, please send an e-mail message (to
both Hans Van Dyck or Nicolas Schtickzelle) in which
you explain why you would like to join us and attach
your CV (including a full publication list and a refer-
ence person) as a separate document.
Please submit your ﬁle no later than September, 15
2008. The application will, however, be closed as soon
as we have a suitable candidate.

UmeaU EvolutionaryModeling
Postdoctoral fellow, Ume˚ a University, Sweden
Numerical methods and computational tools for evo-
lutionary ecology vegetation models based on integro-
partial diﬀerential equations
We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to take on the
numerical and computational challenges arising in an
international research collaboration that aims to de-
velop an evolutionary ecology vegetation model capable
of predicting vegetation structures favored under diﬀer-
ent environmental conditions. The model is physiologi-
cally structured and represented mathematically by an
integro-partial diﬀerential equation, i.e., by a PDE in
which coeﬃcients depend on properties of the solution
such as the light availability at a given height above
ground.
A major objective of your work will be the development
of a fast solver for integro-partial diﬀerential equations
and the development of related computational tools re-
quired for simulations. There is also scope for devel-oping algorithms and methods for studying phenotypic
evolution in physiologically structured population mod-
els. Ume University hosts a center for high-performance
computing, HPC2N, and we expect that you can make
use of these computing resources if needed. Depending
on the direction in which you take your work, the posi-
tion may lead to publications in computational math-
ematics, mathematical/theoretical ecology, or both. In
addition, there is a good opportunity that your contri-
butions will become incorporated in the next generation
of world vegetation models.
The position is available for one year with a possible
prolongation for another period of one year. The post-
doc will be based at the Department of Mathematics
and Mathematical Statistics and will work in close col-
laboration with our international partners, including
the International Institute for Applied Systems Analy-
sis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, and Macquarie Uni-
versity, Sydney, Australia. The position is expected to
entail visits and secondments to one or both of these
institutions, possibly for durations of up to several
months. To qualify for this position, you need a PhD
degree in computational mathematics or a quantitative
science related to the project, preferably not older than
ﬁve years. Experience of programming in C++, parallel
computing, or mathematical ecology will be an advan-
tage, but is not required. Proﬁciency in written and
spoken English is essential.

Location Bioinformatics group at LRI (Laboratoire

Orsay, France
* Topic Understanding the relationships between dif-
ferent species may have consequences both at practical
level (e.g., history of a pathogen agent involved in a
disease), and at fundamental level (e.g., construction
of the tree of life: ﬁnding the history of all organisms).
The study of evolution requires various and numerous
pieces of data such as morphological characteristics of
a set of specimens or, more importantly, genomic and
proteomic sequences of a group of species, functional
and structural annotations. For several years now,
there has been an avalanche of data available. Com-
bining and integrating masses of phylogenomics data is
of parmount importance for better understanding evo-
lution.
* Background More speciﬁcally, this subject is part of
two projects, pPOD and Microbiogenomics.
** On the one hand, pPOD is an international project,
in which data are collected throughout the world by re-
search groups having distinct interests (specialized on84 EvolDir June 2, 2008
diﬀerent groups of species). Data collected by those
various groups are available in a variety of formats (re-
lational, tabulated ﬁles, and so on.).
** On the other hand, partners of the the French
project “ANR masses de donnees” Microbiogenomics
study evolution by building phylogenetic trees based
on families of proteins, part of their data is currently
stored in ﬂat-ﬁles format (trees) and within a relational
warehouse (sequences, annotations).
In both projects, phylogenetists need to ask complex
questions involving all the data, both produced and
consumed by the various steps of the generation and
analysis of phylogenetic trees, including the trees them-
selves or families of trees. Examples of queries include:
What are the diﬀerences between those two trees? If I
modify the alignment by adding gaps, what would be
the impact on the ﬁnal generated tree¿‘ or
”Among the available trees, what are the subtrees
whose proteins are all involved in a given metabolic
pathway? Which are the protein modules appearing in
trees in which a given group of species is monophyletic¿‘
* Work The aim of this work is to enable various phy-
logenetists to make use of all these data in a uniﬁed
way, in the context of a relational database. One of the
main challenges lies in that the relational model does
not ﬁt with hierarchical (tree-based) data.
As a ﬁrst step, queries frequently asked by major pPOD
and Microbiogenomics partners should be identiﬁed.
Queries may be increasingly complex and can be ex-
pressed using diﬀerent kinds of language (relational al-
gebra, SQL and so on). In particular, queries may in-
volve families of trees, comparison and clustering algo-
rithms, and topological features of the trees.
A classiﬁcation of queries should then be proposed.
The third step would consist in exploring the limita-
tions of current relational standards (latest versions
of SQL) to represent phylogenetic data and express
queries. This study should provide the building blocks
for a more expressive high-level query language.

Co-evolution of Darwin’s Finches and parasites
The Clayton Lab (darwin.biology.utah.edu) at the Uni-
versity of Utah in Salt Lake City is seeking a highly
motivated postdoc for an NSF-funded project concern-
ing Darwin’s Finches and their parasites. The project,
which is based in Utah and the Galapagos Islands, is
at the interface of co-evolutionary ecology, immunology,
behavior, and conservation biology. Although Darwin1s
Finches are one of the most famous examples of adap-
tive radiation, we know relatively little about the role
of parasites and pathogens in their ecology, behavior
and evolution. Unfortunately, ﬁnch populations have
recently come under serious threat from the introduced
tropical nest ﬂy Philornis downsi. A better understand-
ing of this parasite is urgently needed because of the
danger it poses to these iconic birds. The overriding
goals of this project are: 1) to conduct rigorous tests of
the impact of P. downsi and other parasites on Darwin’s
Finches; and 2) to determine the ability of the ﬁnches
to defend themselves against parasites. The project
will focus on interactions between P. downsi and the
Medium ground ﬁnch (Geospiza fortis) on Santa Cruz
Island; however, we will also study interactions betweenother species of ﬁnches and their parasite communities.
We hope that this work will help conservation biolo-
gists protect Darwin’s Finches from invasive parasites
and pathogens in the future.
The postdoctoral position is renewable annually for up
to three years, depending on performance and funding.
The salary starts at $35,000 per year, plus beneﬁts. We
are interested in candidates with experience working
under physically demanding ﬁeld conditions. A back-
ground in experimental design and statistical analysis is
essential, and some experience with population or epi-
demiological modeling is a plus. Experience with birds
and parasites/pathogens is desirable, but not essential.
Strong communication skills and experience mentoring
graduate and undergraduate students are also desir-
able. Proﬁciency in Spanish (spoken and written) is
a deﬁnite plus.
To apply, send a single email ﬁle with the items listed
below to Dr. Dale Clayton, c/o Alyssa Farley at:

on publications, ﬁeld experience, and analytical skills
2) One page statement of research interests and future
goals 3) Names & contact info (incl telephone numbers)
of 3-5 referees who are familiar with the applicant’s past
research and skills.
Review of applications will start in mid-June and con-
tinue until a suitable candidate is found. The position
could start as early as August, 2008. The University

LaFouly Switzerland
AdaptiveGeneticVariation Sep3-6
A workshop on “Managing adaptive genetic variation in
conservation biology” will be held in La Fouly, Valais,
Switzerland, from September 3rd to September 6th
2008.
Workshop summary: Current population management
concentrates very much on demographics, local adap-
tion, and on the maintainance of genetic variation. Re-
cent developments in theory and on some model or-
ganisms suggest, however, that there can be signiﬁcant
variation in heritable viability within a population. So-
called ’good genes’ models of sexual selection predict,
for example, that reproductive skews in the wild are
positively linked to heritable viability. Conservation
management should try to minimize any variance in re-
productive success that is not linked to viability traits.
However, including ’good genes’ eﬀects in, for example,
captive or supportive breeding could increase the aver-
age viability in the next generation. This positive ef-
fect would have to be balanced with the management of
overall genetic variation. So far, neutral markers were
mainly used to study the genetic make up of wild pop-
ulations, but new methods and analyses can now give
insights into adaptive genetic variation. We will discuss
the advancements in these ﬁelds and their possible rel-
evance for population management. Invited speakers:
Juha Meril¨ a (University of Helsinki, Finland); WayneJune 2, 2008 EvolDir 91
Potts (University of Utah, USA); Jon Slate (University
of Sheﬃeld, UK); Jay Storz (University of Nebraska,
USA); Pierre Taberlet (CNRS & University of Greno-
ble, France). In addition to invited speakers, partic-
ipants will also have the opportunity to present their
own research. Ample time will be allowed for discus-
sions.
Registration fees are CHF 300, including local accom-
modation and food. Fees are waived for students from
the Swiss universities aﬃliated to the CUSO (Geneva,
Lausanne, Neuchatel, Fribourg and Berne), which will
be given priority.

Workshop on “Maternal eﬀects: Underlying mecha-
nisms and implications for life history evolution”, 25-27
August 2008. The workshop will be held in Adelboden,
Switzerland, a picturesque mountain village at 1400 m
sea level amidst the High Alps of the Berner Oberland.
The study of maternal eﬀects is a rapidly growing ﬁeld
with important implications for questions concerning
life history evolution and population biology. This
workshop aims to further our understanding of mater-
nal eﬀects by bringing together leading scientists of the
ﬁeld working at diﬀerent levels, namely the causation
of maternal eﬀects, their adaptive function and their
long-term consequences for population dynamics and
evolution.
The workshop will include lectures by invited speak-
ers representing a wide range of disciplines including
physiology, developmental biology, evolutionary biol-
ogy, behavioural ecology and mathematics. The major
part of the workshop will be devoted to discussions in
small groups to induce intensive interactions between
students and more advanced researchers and the in-vited experts. Participants will get an overview about
the current approaches used to study maternal eﬀects,
both at the ultimate and proximate levels, and they are
encouraged to discuss potential future directions of this
ﬁeld among each other and with the invited speakers.

Aster Models for Life History Analysis
Instructors: Charles J. Geyer, Professor, Sch. of Statis-
tics, University of Minnesota Ruth G. Shaw, Professor,
Dept. of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University
of Minnesota92 EvolDir June 2, 2008
A two day workshop on aster models will be oﬀered on
June 25th and 26th, 2008 in the School of Statistics
at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Campus.
The workshop will meet from 9 am to 4 pm each day.
There are no fees.
Aster is a newly developed statistical approach that is
designed to address longstanding problems associated
with the joint analysis of life history data (e.g. mea-
sures of survival to reproductive age and fecundity).
Aster can be applied to comparing ﬁtness measures be-
tween groups, estimating ﬁtness landscapes, and esti-
mating population growth rates.
Aster is implemented in the R statistical comput-
ing environment, which is free software and can be
downloaded from http://www.r-project.org . When R
is installed, the aster package is installed using the
“packages” menu. The site http://www.stat.umn.edu/-
geyer/aster/ provides further information on Aster in-
cluding tutorials, technical reports, and publications.
The goal of the workshop is to provide participants with
hands on experience using the aster statistical package.
The majority of workshop activity will be dedicated to
using aster to analyze several pre-selected data sets in
a computer lab setting. If participants have data that
may be appropriate for aster models, we can try that
too. Each phase of the analyses will be covered from for-
matting and loading data to analyzing results. Work-
shop participants will also be introduced to as much of
the theory of aster models as ordinary users need to
know to set up scientiﬁcally sensible aster models, in-
terpret hypothesis tests, and construct conﬁdence inter-
vals. Aster’s applicability to speciﬁc research questions
and data sets of the participants will also be addressed.
Lab space is limited. Please register soon by sending
a brief email to Marcus Warwell at mwarwell@um.edu.

Evolution and the philosophy of biology The Summer
School also wants to be a meeting point for students
interested in the philosophy of science. Since evolution
is the integrative framework for biology as a science,
we could say that evolution is the philosophy of biol-
ogy. We will discuss and share views on the structure of
science and scientiﬁc theories, the paradigms of evolu-
tion and the position of evolutionary theory in present
times.
The work during the summer school Each student
should bring the own laptop. Tasks will include train-
ing in interdisciplinary components, improving trans-
ferable skills (writing, presenting, planning projects),
team-work, working with scientiﬁc literature, develop-
ing a concept of philosophy of science.
The place The Summer School will take
place at the marine biological station in
Carolinensiel ( http://www.uni-muenster.de/-
Biologie.Zoophysiologie/ Station/), located in the
Wadden Sea National Park in Lower Saxony ( http:/-
/www.nationalpark-wattenmeer.niedersachsen.de/-
master/ C5912120 L20D0.html). Carolinensiel is not
too easy to reach by public transportation. We will
try to arrange a bus or to pick you up at Wittmund
(details to be speciﬁed later on with the participants).
The timing From June 30th (Monday) to July 11th (Fri-
day). Arriving date June 29th (Sunday) and leaving
date July 12th (Saturday).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.

This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
