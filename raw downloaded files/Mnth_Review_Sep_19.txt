The American Society of Naturalists invites graduate
students, postdocs, faculty and other professionals from
ecology, evolution, behavior, genetics, physiology, and
associated elds to a stand alone meeting at the Asilo-
mar Conference Grounds on January 3-7, 2020. This
meeting will celebrate the unique ability of ASN to unify
broad conceptual themes across biology by integrating
theory with data and by using new technological tools
to address long-standing questions. In short, this con-
ference will showcase what it means to be a naturalist
and researcher in the 21st century.
This conference is unique because it involves a small
number of participants (200 people) interacting closely
over meals, scientic talks, and casual conversations in
a beautiful natural setting on the shore of the Mon-
terey Peninsula. The scientic program will consist of
posters, 15-minute talks, and 5-minute lightning talks,
in addition to three symposia in the afternoons. Light-
ning talks will also include ve minutes for questions,
so are helpful for getting feedback and starting a con-
versation. Evening activities will include a presidential
debate, a natural history trivia contest, and interac-
tions around a bonre. More information is available
at www.amnat2020.com . If you have any questions,
concerns, or suggestions, please email Casey terHorst

Proposed symposium topics should support the Societys
goal to advance the conceptual unication of the bio-
logical sciences and to further knowledge in evolution,
ecology, behavior, and organismal biology. Proposals
should be synthetic and interdisciplinary, and address
important emerging issues in evolution, ecology, or be-
havior. A budget of $8,000 for travel, registration, and
accommodation is provided to help defray expenses.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (one page); (3) a list of six speak-
ers, including institutional aliations, who have agreed
to participate in the symposium; (4) a justication for
the symposium, explaining why the topic and speakers
are appropriate for a Society-sponsored symposium (up
to one page).
Please submit proposals by midnight Eastern Standard
Time on October 1, 2019, by email (kmkay@ucsc.edu)
as a single pdf attachment, under subject heading: ASN
Symposium Proposal: Evolution 2020. Proposals that
include women, young investigators, and individuals
from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged.4 EvolDir September 1, 2019
The Societys selection committee will evaluate propos-
als based on the likelihood of attracting a substantial
audience, the signicance and timeliness of the topic,
and on the topics diering substantively from recent
symposia hosted by the Society. All applicants will be
notied of the decision before the end of November.

tive strategies of plants and animals at the University of
Debrecen (Hungary), we will host a three-day interna-
tional symposium in November 2019. The Symposium
will start with a welcome reception in the University
Aula at 7 pm on Thursday 7 November 2019.
The Symposium will provide a forum for researchers of
reproductive behaviour of microbes, plants and animals
including humans to consider the current state of science
and where the eld is going. World-leading speakers will
overview their recent research and address the future
challenges facing the eld. The conference will close
on Sunday 10 November with an optional excursion to
nearby Hortobagy National Park, an UNESCO World
Heritage Site.
The Symposium will be opened by Profs Rosemary and
Peter Grant (Princeton), and followed by plenary speak-

symposia/2020/EES20-01/ Symposium Overview
We are at the dawn of a new era of biology where we will
start to understand how organisms function together
and react or adapt to changes at dierent molecular
levels. This includes the multitude of stresses that or-
ganisms are exposed to, from malnutrition and adverse
climate events to many other biological, chemical and
physical insults. Progress in biological analyses at both
a single scale and across scales, have allowed us to fur-
ther understand organisms in the context of dynamic
environments. These can be environments which are
changed by disease, commensal cohabitation or compe-
tition, as well as abiotic factors. With the molecular
understanding we already have at the cellular and organ-
ismal levels, and new tools and quantitative approaches,
this symposium will address how genotype and the en-
vironment bring about phenotypes at the population
level.
Session Topics
- Small-scale evolutionary experiments: model organisms
- Small-scale evolutionary experiments: model ecosys-
tems - Eects of environmental variation and stress -
Adaptive responses to environmental variation - Popu-
lation level genome changes in nature - Preparing for
the future

Helsinki InsectAdaptation Jul19-24
The XXVI international Congress of Entomology is hap-
pening July 19-24 2020, in Helsinki, Finland. We are
soliciting submission for oral presentations in the sym-
posium: Spatial population and community dynamics
during climate change.
Symposium description: Insect populations and the
composition of the communities that they inhabit are
dynamic. These dynamics depend on biotic and abiotic
processes occurring locally and at a landscape scale.
The eects of climate change on these determinants of
population and community dynamics may be complex,
but are also important to understand in the face of the
decline of biodiversity that we experience globally as a
result of climate change. In this symposium we present
current theoretical and empirical research on spatial
patterns of population and community level responses
to climate change.
Symposium organizers: Saskya van Nouhuys, Kristjan

BarIlanU SexualNetworks
We are looking for a PhD student for a project on *sex-
ual networks* and *alternative mating tactics* in the
*rock hyrax*. The project involves tracking of social
and sexual interactions using state-of-the-art sensors.
The student will be supervised by Dr. Amiyaal Ilany
at Bar Ilan University, in collaboration with Dr. Lee
Koren.
The project involves extensive eldwork 6 months a year
at the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, Israel.
The ideal applicant has a strong background in behav-
ioral ecology, eld experience handling wildlife, and data
analysis skills using R.
Starting date: exible, around December 2019 - January
2020
Stipend: Bar-Ilan University President Scholarship
Housing: Provided during the eld season
Scientic description: Sexual selection is an important
agent of evolution, driving fundamental evolutionary
processes such as speciation, mutation rates, and local
extinction rates. The eect of sexual selection on these
phenomena depends on its strength within a population.
Therefore, measuring sexual selection is important to
understanding key evolutionary processes. Tradition-
ally, sexual selection is measured at the population level,
assuming no population structure. In addition, most
previous studies in this eld focused on trait-based mate
choice. However, recent evidence suggests that the social
structure and intrasexual competition result in complex
dynamic patterns of sexual interactions. These patterns
can be summarized as a sexual network, describing the
interactions among males and females. This network
determines the level of local intrasexual competition
experienced by each individual. Here, we will study how
alternative mating tactics shape the sexual network, and
the consequences of these tactics in terms of mating and
reproductive success. We will build on a long-term study
of a wild rock hyrax population, operating for the last
20 years. In this population, we identied three alterna-
tive mating tactics employed by males. Male hyraxes
advertise their presence and their traits to rival males
via acoustic signals. We will experimentally manipulate
the sexual network using playback experiments. These
playbacks are designed to cause males and females to
switch their tactics, allowing us to examine the resultingsexual networks and their reproductive consequences.
We will use novel proximity loggers to track the impact
of these manipulations on sexual network dynamics in
a population of marked individuals with well-known life
histories. In addition, we will develop theoretical models
of sexual network dynamics, and test them using the
data we will collect. This study will be the rst to test
a set of predictions regarding the ne-scale temporal
dynamics of sexual networks. It will expand our un-
derstanding of the selective forces shaping alternative
mating tactics. Furthermore, it has the potential to
expose biases in how sexual selection is measured in
many species as a result of overlooking the temporal
dynamics of sexual interactions.
Job description:
The student's tasks include:
1. Planning experiments and developing specic research
questions.
2. Fieldwork: trapping, marking, and observing hyraxes;
performing experimental manipulations using playbacks.
3. Analyzing data (including behavioral observations,
life history, proximity loggers data, and possibly genomic
data).
4. Writing scientic papers and presenting results in
local & international conferences.
5. Optional: simulating sexual network dynamics.
Requirements:
- Candidates should have a Master's Degree in biology
or equivalent by the starting date.
- The most important requirement is a strong inter-
est in studying the behavioral ecology of wild animals.
This requires patience, care to many small details, and
willingness to spend many hours and days in the eld.

HabitatChoiceEvolution
We are accepting applications for a funded 3-year PhD
position beginning January 2020 as part of the ANR
CHOOSE, to study the environmental drivers of habitat
choice evolution using ciliate microcosms.
Individuals that choose to leave a habitat to join another
are often phenotypically dierent from those that stay
in this habitat. The major consequences of non- ran-
dom dispersal decisions that are both phenotype- and
context- dependent have been recently developed under
habitat choice theory. Compared to random dispersal,
this theory predicts that habitat choice based disper-
sal should generate spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes
and thus lead to drastically dierent consequences for
a variety of ecological and evolutionary dynamics such
as range distribution, metapopulation dynamics and
local adaptation. However, our comprehension of what
drives the evolution of habitat choice and its ensuing
consequences remains weak, especially because of the
lack of experimental approaches dedicated to testing
theoretical predictions.
The PhD project specically aims at testing experi-
mentally theoretical predictions about the conditions
required for habitat choice evolution, with additional
perspectives regarding thermal adaptation and species
interactions. The hired PhD will join a dynamic interna-
tional team whose research interests range from under-
standing the genetic mechanisms underlying individual14 EvolDir September 1, 2019
phenotypes, including dispersal, to the consequences of
variability in dispersal strategies and other phenotypic
traits for populations and communities, using both the-
ory and experiments. The position will be co-supervised
by Staan Jacob and Delphine Legrand (Theoretical
and Experimental Ecology Station, CNRS, France). We
are looking for a highly motivated and dynamic can-
didate with deep conceptual interests in evolutionary
ecology. Previous experience in microbiology, molecular
biology and cytometry are benecial but not mandatory.
Applicants should send a cover letter (1-2 pages max de-
scribing motivation for the present project and previous
and current activities) and CV (including list of publi-
cations if any) to S. Jacob (staan.jacob@sete.cnrs.fr),
before September 6, 2019. Short-listed candidates will
be interviewed in mid-September.

GhentU 4 EvolutionaryGenomics
Four 4-year PhD studentships are available in the Van
de Peer Lab (Bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics)
at the VIB Center for Plant Systems Biology at Ghent
University, Belgium.
The Van de Peer lab studies the evolution of (plant)
genomes and in particular the importance of gene and
genome duplication for evolution and adaptation. This
is done mainly using computational approaches but
more recently also using evolutionary experiments and
through lab work. More information can be found at ourwebsite at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/beg/ . In
particular, we are looking for the following applicants:
1. One PhD student will conduct academic research
(full-time) in the eld of network biology. Starting Jan-
uary 2020.
1.a. Project: Gene duplications and particularly whole
genome duplications (WGDs) aect the structure of
genomes and the encoded gene regulatory networks
(GRNs). While redundancy facilitates the gradual evo-
lution and rewiring of duplicated networks for adapta-
tion in the longer term, the more complex structure of
duplicated GRNs might also allow polyploids to explore
a wider evolutionary landscape, providing short-term
increased opportunity to adapt to novel, dierent, or
rapidly changing environments. Through WGD, in-
creased complexity, modularity and functional redun-
dancy following WGD could help explain the dierent
behavior of polyploids and non-polyploids under stable
or challenging environments. We want to develop a
computational framework to study the eects of WGD
on the structure of genomes and the underlying genetic
networks in simulation. We want to investigate how
duplicated networks aect evolvability of genomes and
adaptation and evolution of their hosts. The PhD work
will involve scientic research in the domain of algo-
rithms and graph-theory, specically linked to the eld
of evolution.
1.b. Prole of the candidate: The applicant should
have a master's degree in bio-engineering, mathematics,
physics or computer science (or equivalent) or will have
obtained this degree by the start of appointment, which
is January 2020. A strong interest in - and some knowl-
edge of - evolutionary biology is required. The applicant
should be procient in programming and have proven
(e.g. student project, master thesis, ...) strong analyti-
cal skills for designing models and analyzing research
results. The applicant should be able to work indepen-
dently and should have a strong feeling of responsibility.
Very good command of the English language, and good
communication skills, oral and in writing, are essential.
1.c. How to apply: Send your application to
yves.vandepeer@psb.ugent.be. Your application should
include a detailed CV, a cover letter (max. 2 pages, in-
cluding your research interests and motivation to apply)
and contact information of two referees. All documents
should be merged into a single PDF.

2.a. Project: The potential role of whole genome dupli-
cation (WGD) in evolution is controversial. Whereas
some view WGD mainly as detrimental and an evolu-
tionary dead end, there is growing evidence that the
long-term establishment of polyploidy might be linked
to environmental change, stressful conditions, or peri-
ods of extinction. However, despite much research, the
mechanistic underpinnings of why and how polyploids
might be able to outcompete non-polyploids at times
of environmental upheaval remain elusive. Dierent hy-
potheses have been proposed to explain how stressful
conditions might promote the formation of polyploids,
how polyploidization might confer tness advantages,
and how polyploids might adapt faster to a changing
environment. Using a combination of long- and short-
term evolution experiments on the greater duckweed
Spirodela polyrhiza and whole genome (re)sequencing,
we aim to test some of these hypotheses and to gain in-
sights into the stabilization of a polyploid genome. The
project has several components, such as creating neoau-
topolyploid duckweed lineages with dierent genetic
backgrounds, testing the immediate eects of WGD on
the survival, tness and the phenotype (and its plastic-
ity) of duckweed in dierent environments, and studying
the genomic stabilization, transcriptional dynamics and
proteomic changes subsequent to WGD.

EvolutionRegulatoryElements
We currently have an open position for an ERC-funded
PhD student (65%, TVL-13) for a project aimed at
understanding the functional consequences of regulatory
mutations using a combination of population genetic
modelling and single-cell RNA/ATAC-Seq data.Our lab (www.gareldlab.org) studies the evolution of
gene regulation in development with the long-term aim
of understanding how population-level processes con-
tribute to developmental changes that dene species.
In our research we adhere closely to the idea that un-
derstanding how development evolves requires an un-
derstanding of how development works. As such, we
maintain a close aliation with the BIMSB and the
MDC-based researchers with whom we work to improve
single-cell methods for understanding development. But
there are cases too in which evolution can act in the
service of biomedical research. This project is one of
those cases.
Rare mutations play an important role in generating
phenotypic diversity and contribute disproportionately
to human disease. Unfortunately, by virtue of their
rarity, it is dicult to know which of the many rare mu-
tations carried by a patient are responsible for a given
phenotype/disease. This is particularly challenging in
the non-coding genome where a lack of a clear genetic
code makes it dicult to ascertain the consequences of
mutations from sequence alone. One promising approach
is to make use of a combination of population genetic
data and functional annotations to predict the likely
functional consequences of new mutations in specic
classes of regulatory elements (e.g. PMID: 28288115).
A challenge in applying this approach, however, is that
human populations have relatively few segregating mu-
tations relative to other species, which limits the amount
of information that can be obtained from segregating
allele frequencies. We will thus make use of Drosophila
melanogaster, a species with a vastly larger eective
populations size, an order of magnitude more SNPs,
and shorter blocks of linkage-disequilibrium. Speci-
cally, in this project, we will combine population genetic
datasets with a growing body of single- cell sequencing
data to estimate selective constraints and the functional
consequences of new mutations in dierent categories of
regulatory element. Our ultimate goal is to understand
the constraints that limit genome evolution and to con-
tribute to predictive models of fundamental regulatory
processes that we hope will translate across species.
Applications will be taken until the position is lled. In-
terested candidates should send a CV, a cover letter, and
contact information for 2 references *as a single PDF*
to dagareld@gareldlab.org. I'm happy to answer in-

EVOLDIR : JYUFinland.SexEvolTardigrade
PhD Title: Sexual selection in tardigrades: sex-
(in)dependent mechanisms
Duration: January 2020 ' December 2023
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate to
join our new and enthusiastic research group led by Dr.
Sara Calhim, at the University of Jyv askyl a (Finland).
We investigate key themes in reproductive evolutionary
biology using a little studied but charismatic group of
organisms ' tardigrades (a.k.a. water bears).
These transparent, microscopic ( <1mm), eight-legged
animals are well known for their ability to survive ex-
treme stressors in a cryptobiotic (i.e. ametabolic) state.
However, they also have incredibly diverse but largely
unexplored reproductive biology which makes them the
ideal study system to tackle long standing questions
in the eld of sexual selection and reproductive trait
evolution.
Sexual selection is an important evolutionary force that
acts on traits associated with the ability to access mates
and/or fertilizations. It is well established that it can
aect both sexes. However, most research uses study
systems where the traits under sexual selection dier
markedly between the sexes and/or the mechanisms
by which they evolve are confounded by dierent as-
pects of the species' biology (e.g. due to marked sexual
dimorphism in morphology, behavior, physiology or life-
history. As a result, male and female phenotypes cannot
be studied simultaneously or in a biologically relevant
comparable way. Tardigrades have little sexual dieren-
tiation, short generation time, and tractable (mating)
behavior and development. Therefore, they are ideally
suited for researching of sex-(in)dependent mechanisms
of sexual selection (i.e. using equivalent measures and
experimental protocols). This PhD project will make a
valuable contribution to the eld beyond increased sci-
entic knowledge, through the development of tools for
quantitative assessment chemical signals and parentage
assignment in this phylum.Requirements:
A Master's degree in Evolutionary Biology, Ecology or
Molecular Biology. Previous experience with handling
microscopic organisms and/or using chemical or genomic
laboratory and analytical tools are an advantage. The
candidate must show considerable written and verbal
communication skills in English, independent and cre-
ative thinking, and an ability to work collaboratively.
The University of Jyv askyl a promotes equal opportuni-
ties.

Emmy Noether program. The position is 75% and re-
search only (no classes and teaching required). The
position should start between 1st October 2019 and 1st
April.
The main research topic for the PhD project is to de-
velop methods for species tree estimation. Traditionally,
estimates of gene trees have been used as a proxy to
infer species trees. However, dierent genes have dier-
ent evolutionary histories because of various biological18 EvolDir September 1, 2019
processes (e.g., incomplete lineage sorting, gene ow and
hybridization, gene duplication and losses). The focus
of the PhD thesis will be on developing new statistical
methods to estimate species phylogenies while account-
ing for gene tree variation and apply these methods to
estimate species phylogenies from genomic data.
Applicants should have a Master's degree, completed
or completion imminent, in bioinformatics, biostatistics,
computer science, evolutionary biology or a related eld.
The key skills required are prociency programming
(C, C++ or Java) and good communication skills (oral
and written English). Basic knowledge in phylogenetics
and statistical inference (especially Bayesian statistics)
is benecial but not required. Training in these skills
will be provided depending on need. The thesis will
be written in English. No knowledge of German is re-
quired but some basic knowledge will be helpful outside
of work. Enthusiasm, determination and the capacity
to work independently are essential. The candidate is
highly encouraged to develop their own research ideas
complementing the current research direction.
My group is broadly working on theory and compu-
tational methods for Bayesian inference of phylogeny
(https://hoehnalab.github.io). The research directions
include phylogeny inference, divergence time estimation,
diversication rate estimation and model testing. All of
our methods are implemented in the open-source pro-
gram RevBayes (http://www.RevBayes.com) which is
the successor software of the popular program MrBayes.
The successful applicant will be part of our vibrant
RevBayes group and will contribute to further develop-
ment of the program. There will be opportunities for the
successful applicant to work with and visit the research
groups of my collaborators in Europe and the USA.
Furthermore, I expect the candidate to become actively
involved in our RevBayes workshops and hackathons.
My group is located at the GeoBio-Center of the LMU
Munich, one of Germany's and Europe's top Univer-
sities (#32 world-wide; #8 in Europe; #1 in Ger-
many; https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-
university-rankings/lmu-munich). The GeoBio-Center
is located at the Konigsplatz which is in walking distance
to the historic city center (Marienplatz) and English
Garden (city park with 3.75 km' area). The GeoBio-
Center is highly interdisciplinary and consists of re-
searchers from dierent departments including paleon-
tology, molecular and evolutionary biology, zoology and
botany.
The position will be compensated according to the stan-
dard DFG salary scheme (75% of TVL-E13; approx.
2750emonthly gross salary; approx. 1650 emonthly net
salary). The salary includes benets such as health care,30 days of vacation per year, pension, unemployment
insurance and child support (if applicable).
LMU Munich is an equal opportunity employer. We
strongly encourage applications from female candidates.
LMU Munich intends to enhance the diversity of its
employees. Furthermore, disabled candidates with es-
sentially equal qualications will be given preference.
Further information can be found at (https://-
hoehnalab.github.io), and questions should be directed
to Sebastian Hohna (hoehna@lmu.de). Applications, in-
cluding a letter of motivation and your research interests
(1 page), current CV and names and contact details of
two referees should be sent to Sebastian Hohna before
the deadline of 31 August 2019. After the deadline I
will start reviewing all applications and invite selected
candidates for an interview.

ble Bee Thermal Tolerance:
Multiple PhD positions are available in the laboratories
of Je Lozier and Janna Fierst at The University of
Alabama as part of a recently awarded NSF Rules of
Life project: Bumble bee cold tolerance across eleva-
tions - From epigenotype to phenotype across space,
time, and levels of biological organization. PhD stu-
dents will be involved in studying the links between
genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic variation in re-
lation to local thermal tolerance adaptation in montane
bumble bees. The project will involve extensive high
throughput sequencing of bees from wild populations
and experimental colonies and the use of approaches
like network theory to model and draw inferences from
these complex data. Students will develop questions
relating to ecological and evolutionary genomics within
the broader project objectives. The focus of the posi-
tions is exible, and we expect there will be a great deal
of collaboration among project personnel.
We are looking to recruit highly motivated students
with interests in applying modern molecular and com-
putational tools to address ecological and evolutionary
questions in a non-model organism. Applicants should
have a strong academic record (GPA >3.0), an ability
for clear verbal and written communication, and a de-
sire to learn new skills! Students funded o the grant

Two PhD positions in evolutionary biology
Project title: Developing attract & infect strategies
against the Fall Armyworm in Africa
Where: Two PhD positions are available at the
University of Amsterdam (PhD1) and Wagenin-
gen University (PhD2) to develop region-specic at-
tract & infect strategies against the Fall Armyworm
(/Spodoptera frugiperda/) in East Africa (Kenya) and
West Africa (Togo-Benin) by a) identifying region-
specic pheromone lures (PhD1) and b) investigating
species-specic viruses (PhD2), based on eld experi-
ments, in collaboration with local farmers and an inter-
national network of academic and industrial partners.
Field work (10-15 months in total) will be conducted in
collaboration with /icipe/ in Kenya and IITA in Benin
and Togo.
What: The Fall Armyworm (FAW) /Spodoptera
frugiperda/ (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), a major pest
in staple crops in North and South America, recently
invaded Africa and is spreading with incredible speed.
Currently, control of this pest insect mainly depends
on chemical insecticides, which negatively aect the
environment and non-target species and, in addition,
resistance towards these insecticides has already been
reported. Therefore, there is a urgent need for safe,
sustainable, environmental friendly alternative control
measures that can be easily applied in the eld by lo-
cal farmers. Biological control methods that are cur-
rently used to control lepidopteran insect pests include
pheromone trapping (trapping male moths using fe-
male pheromones) and the spraying of baculoviruses
(killing caterpillars). This project aims to combine both
methods, as this may yield exciting opportunities forSeptember 1, 2019 EvolDir 23
biological control, surpassing the eectiveness of each
single method.
For sustainable pest management development, the evo-
lution of both the pest and the virus should be taken
into account. Specically, sexual signals or responses
likely vary in dierent geographic locations, due to inter-
actions with local species and environmental conditions,
so that region-specic lures will need to be developed. In
addition, developing a successful attract-and-infect strat-
egy will depend on the genetic insect variants present.
To identify possible host and pathogenicity factors, full
sequences of virus strains diering in host specicity
and pathogenicity will be compared. It is also important
to determine if, and at what speed, virus resistance can
develop and to understand the mechanism(s) through
which this can occur. Full genome analyses of suscepti-
ble and resistant /Spodoptera/ spp should identify virus
resistance markers. These markers will allow selection
of best virus strains, and help in the early identication
of possible resistance development in /Spodoptera/ pop-
ulations. Furthermore, strategies involving alternation
of virus isolates will be tested, to minimize the risk of
resistance development.

students to join the lab in the Summer/Fall 2020. Our re-
search focuses on the computational analysis of genomic
and transcriptomic data generated by next-generation
sequencing platforms from non-model forest tree species.
We implement this through analysis related to gene
nding, gene expression, transcriptome assembly, and
conserved element identication, through machine learn-
ing and computational statistics. We use these methods
to address questions related to genome biology and pop-
ulation genomics. In addition, we develop web-based
applications that integrate BIG data across domains
to facilitate the forest geneticist or ecologist's ability
to analyze, share, and visualize their data ( http://-

FungalEvolutionaryGenetics
Open PhD Position in Comparative and Population
genomics of insect-pathogenic fungi
We are seeking a candidate to ll a fully funded PhD po-
sition for a period of 3 years in the Applied Evolutionary
Ecology research group led by Henrik H. De Fine Licht
at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark (https://-
plen.ku.dk/english/research/organismal biology/aee/).
We are looking for a committed and enthusiastic grad-
uate student to work with insect-pathogenic fungal ge-
netics, evolution and ecology. We specically aim to
explore the genomic basis of phenotypic variation in vir-
ulence and host specialization using insect-pathogenic
fungi as a model. Fungi in the genus Metarhizium show
remarkable diversity between species in terms of host
range and capacity for plant-root colonization. There
is also ample diversity within species among isolates in
pathogenic capacity, toxin production, and nutritional
growth characteristics. The project aims to investigate
the genomic components of the present diversity be-
tween and within Metarhizium species, and how this
genomic diversity is related to the capacity for making
a host shift to a new insect species. The project will use
comparative genomics and population genomics coupled
with bioassays in the laboratory. A large in-house col-
lection of viable insect-pathogenic fungal isolates from
the genus of Metarhizium will be used in combination
with international culture collections, but there is also
possibility for sampling new material.
The successful PhD student will thus obtain compe-
tences within mycology, fungal genomics and population
genomics, and applied bioinformatics. We are looking
for candidates with experience in any or all of the follow-
ing areas: Fungal pathogen biology, mycological tech-
niques, population genetics/genomics, molecular genetic
laboratory techniques, and computational analysis of ge-
nomic sequence data (programming, e.g. Perl, Python,
Bash, R; genome/transcriptome assembly; comparative
genomics). Most importantly, the successful candidate
is enthusiastic, has a good grasp of population and evo-
lutionary biology and is interested in host-pathogen
evolution.
The project is funded by a Danish Research Council
Sapere Aude Starting Grant and involves researchers atSeptember 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
University of Copenhagen and University of Maryland
(USA). The PhD student will be supervised by Associate
Professor Henrik H. De Fine Licht and co-supervised by
Associate Professor Nicolai V. Meyling.
To apply, please rst contact Henrik H. De Fine Licht

UFrancheComt UrbanBiodiversity
Three-years PhD position (funded)
Subject: Assessing the capacity of urban form to pre-
serve biodiversity: A simulation-based approach
Context and objectives: The PhD is part of the
REFUGE project (CNRS 80 jPRIME call) about bio-
diversity inside urban agglomerations. The aim is to
compare several types of urban extensions according to
their ability to preserve animal populations in the long
run. The main hypothesis is that under specic condi-
tions, fractal urban form provides interesting ecological
properties. More broadly, urban forms are expected to
dier according to their capacity to provide a suitable
framework to animal populations.
The methodological plan of this work is to compare dif-
ferentiated scenarios of urban development in a prospec-
tive approach, and, for each of them, to evaluate the
evolution of genetic diversity of several species. This ap-
proach will rely on the combination of a model devoted
to the simulation of urban growth (changing model's
parameters to simulate dierent urban forms) and a
simulation model of gene ow used in dynamic way ac-
cording to the land cover changes dened in the rst
model. The case studies will involve both theoretical
cities and a real urban agglomeration (city of Lyon,
France).
Key words: Urban form, Fractal city, Ecological impact,
Landscape genetics, Simulation.
Supervision and resources: The PhD will be super-
vised by Jean-Christophe Folt^ ete (University of Franche-
Comt e, UMR Th eMA) and St ephane Garnier (Univer-
sity of Burgundy, UMR Biog eosciences). It will benet
from the budget of the REFUGE project and scientic
support will be provided by the sta of this project:
spatial modelling, geomatics and application develop-
ment at TheMA, and population genetics and landscape
genetics at Biog eosciences.
Skills and instruction to apply The candidate needs to
have: (1) either a master in geography, (2) or a master
in ecology or evolutionary biology. In the rst case, we
expect a geographer specialized in environmental mod-
elling (knowledge in landscape ecology will be a plus). A
training in concepts and methods of population genetic
will be necessary. In the second case, we expect a biolo-
gist or an ecologist with skills in population genetics andin spatial analysis (or who will learn these methods). In
all cases, the candidate should have a strong interest for
theoretical approaches.
Applications including a CV and a cover letter must
be sent by the 20th of September 2019 to the following
address: jean-christophe.foltete@univ-fcomte.fr

Project description: Deep evolutionary genomics of
Monogenea The Neodermata (Platyhelminthes) are a
highly diverse assemblage of obligate parasitic atworms
(estimated 40,000 - 100,000 species), comprising Ces-
toda (tapeworms), Monogenea, and Trematoda (ukes),
many of biomedical, veterinary and economic impor-
tance. Together, they span an impressive range of hosts
and parasitic lifestyles. Despite decades of research,
however, the relationships between the main parasitic
lineages remain contentious. Recent work has sought
to resolve the controversy by means of phylogenomic
inference, but particularly Monogenea remain vastly
underrepresented in these datasets, despite their im-
portance and ubiquity. With their simple, direct life
cycles, monogeneans are key for understanding the shift
towards obligate parasitism of vertebrates, the evolu-
tionary history of ecto- and endoparasitism, and the
emergence of complex life cycles in Neodermata. We
will assemble draft genomes for 50+ representatives of
the Monogenea (Platyhelminthes; Neodermata), aim-
ing for complete coverage of all monogenean families,
based on a combination of short and long NGS read
data. Genes will be identied in the genome assemblies
using a combination of existing and newly generated
(RNAseq) physical evidence and ab initio gene predic-
tion. Phylogenetic relationships of the Neodermata and
especially the Monogenea, will be inferred based on the
newly assembled and previously published gene com-
plements. We will investigate patterns of gene/gene
family loss/expansion and conservation/disruption of
metabolic pathways associated with shifts in parasite
life history traits.

operates on four campuses in Helsinki and at 15 other
locations. The high-quality research carried out by the
university creates new knowledge for educating diverse
specialists in various elds, and for utilization in social
decision-making and the business sector.
The Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sci-
ences (https://www.helsinki./en/faculty-of-biological-
and-environmental-sciences) is Finland's most high pro-
le and extensive hub of research and teaching in the
eld. The Faculty is comprised of three research pro-
grammes ' Ecosystems and Environment, Molecular and
Integrative Biosciences, and Organismal and Evolution-28 EvolDir September 1, 2019

Evolution of natural populations, population genetics
and dynamics, and Climate Change.
The Laboratory of Dr. Anne DUPLOUY
(www.anneduplouy.net) is part of the Organis-
mal and Evolutionary Biology programme, and studies
host-symbiont interactions and insect communities to
investigate diverse evolutionary and ecological processes.
We now invite applications for a xed term position
(up to 4years) as DOCTORAL STUDENT funded by
the Academy of Finland. Highly motivated students
showing independent thinking, and ability to learn and
implement new skills from dierent research elds are
highly encouraged to apply.
Remove all symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, chloroplasts or
gut-microbes and we loose all 25,000 species of orchids,
most of plants or our ability to digest food. Symbionts
are microorganisms that live in intimate association with
almost all Eukaryotes. Their ubiquitousness is mainly
explained by various means that symbionts have evolved
to promote their own tness, to spread or survive in
their host population, and to ensure their transmission
through generations (i.e. vertical transmission). The
symbiont-induced phenotypes include manipulating the
hosts' reproductive system and other life-history traits,
such as host fecundity, dispersal abilities or response
to pathogen and environmental extremes. Depending
on the study system, the phenotypes are benecial or
costly to the host. Although many studies suggest that
around 60% of all insect species are infected by herita-
ble symbionts, those microorganisms have rarely been
considered within the complexity of insect communities.
Consequently, we lack a full understanding of how natu-
ral communities work, and how symbionts may play a
key role in the shaping of those communities.
In this project, the PhD candidate will enquire about
the dynamics of two symbionts (Wolbachia and Mi-
crosporidia) in a natural insect community. The candi-
date will investigate the favored routes of transfer of the
symbionts (between and within species), and the main
biotic and abiotic factors aecting symbiotic transfers
(e.g: temperature, competition). The study system will
be the well-characterized insect community associated
with the ribwort plantain, in the Sland islands (between
the coasts of Finland and Sweden). The candidate will
be asked to perform eldwork, and various experiments
using ecological approaches in the eld and in the labo-
ratory, as well as using various tools in the molecular
laboratory. The system includes many species whose
ecology has been studied for over 15years, e.g. the host
plant (Plantago lanceolata), the Glanville fritillary but-
tery (Melitaea cinxia), several associated parasitoid
wasps (Hyposoter horticola, Cotesia melitearum), andothers. The project is highly collaborative and should
allow the candidate to build an international research
network. All ndings will be published in Open Access
international journals, and the candidate is expected to
present in scientic meetings.
Successful candidates will be employed on a full-time,
xed term four-year contract starting September 2019 or
by agreement, however no later than January 2020. For

Transmission ratio distorters, or drivers are genes that
break the rst law of Mendelian genetics, manipulating
the processes of gametogenesis and/or fertilisation so
that they are passed on to more than 50% of ospring.
Driving genes on the sex chromosomes cause sex ratio
skewing, while driving genes on other chromosomes can
lead to the selsh spread of chromosome rearrangements
and contribute to speciation. Although recent strides
have been made in understanding drive arising during
female meiosis, the mechanisms of male drive remain
elusive despite the existence of several well-established
model systems. This project seeks to understand male
drive from three complementary perspectives; how indi-
vidual genes cause drive, how genome rearrangements
contribute to drive, and the evolutionary consequences
of drive for genome structure.
The specic aims of this project are to: - Investigate
how haploid selection in male gametes biases reproduc-
tive processes to skew transmission ratios away from
a Mendelian 50:50 ratio, using cutting-edge single-cell
omics analysis. - Study how silencing of unsynapsed
chromatin in postmeiotic cells potentially contributes to
haploid selection using RNA- Seq and ChIP-Seq - Recon-
struct evolutionary patterns of genome rearrangement
and link these to the underlying selective dynamics that30 EvolDir September 1, 2019

PhD position foraging ecology and evolutionary niche
dierentiation of Gal apagos marine iguanas
University of Leipzig, Institute of Biology, Molecular
Evolution and Systematics of Animals, Leipzig, Ger-
many
This PhD position investigates the importance of for-
aging ecology for evolutionary divergence and targets
for candidates with a Application deadline: September,
15th 2019
Gal apagos marine iguanas have adapted to the marine
environment as no other lizard worldwide and are en-
demic to the islands of the Gal apagos archipelago. One
of their key adaptations to exploit the resources of the
marine environment involves the ability to dive and
graze the tidal and intertidal zones of islands for edible
algae that are digested with the help of a specialized
gut microbiome. Although the consumption of algae
represents a key element of the ecology and evolution
of marine iguanas, we know little with regards to which
species are consumed and whether island populations
of marine iguanas dier in their foraging niche.
This PhD project aims to ll this important knowledge
gap by exploring the extent to which island populations
dier in regard to their foraging niche, and how this
has impacted the evolutionary divergence of popula-
tions. Based on a specically developed metabarcod-
ing approach ' which can identify the consumed algae
species from faecal samples ' we aim to obtain the rst
archipelago-wide inventory of consumed algae species.
In a second step, stable isotope analysis will be com-
bined with metabarcoding to explore dierences in the
foraging niche of marine iguanas on a ne geographical
scale among populations from San Cristobal Island. For
this project part, we aim to determine dierences in the
foraging niche of marine iguanas that relate to annual
season, life stage, and sex. Finally, we are going to
integrate how whether the evolutionary divergence of
populations is shaped by niche dierentiation.
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate
with a strong interest in ecology and molecular methods
related to ecology. Spanish language skills and experi-
ence with challenging eld work would be advantageous.

UMontpellier BatEvolution
This PhD thesis is part of an ANR project (REPAST,
2019-2024): \Retro-observatories of animal biodiver-
sity during the Anthropocene: how have global changes
aected populations and communities?".
Context
The populations of many European bat species experi-enced a dramatic decline in the 1950s-1970s, and most
of them are currently considered to be vulnerable or
endangered species. Several species, widespread in all
Europe before the 1940s, became locally extinct. Scien-
tists failed to clearly identify the causes of such a decline.
In the absence of long-term data, international groups
of bat experts listed the most likely causes of bat de-
cline. This hypothetical list of causes of decline includes
land-use changes, disturbance and loss of roosts, envi-
ronmental pollution, climate changes, decline of insect
preys, loss of genetic diversity, and infectious diseases.
Although these are credible, they are poorly supported
by eld data, and are geographically and temporally
variable. Moreover, these causes may act simultaneously,
as none of them can explain alone the decline.
In this context, REPAST propose to crossbreed meth-
ods generally used in paleoecology, environmental his-
tory and ecology to reconstruct long-term history of
bat populations and some of the hypothetical causes
of their decline, using three types of archives: 1) Bat
guano accumulations. All bat populations exhibit a
yearly life cycle: the location of their roosts varies in
time (i.e. season) and space. However, bats are known
to be highly philopatric: individuals, at least females,
come back every year in their natal roost where they
can form large (and sometimes multispecies) colonies.
Some roosts have been sheltering hundreds of bats for
decades, centuries or even millennia. In these roosts,
the droppings (guano) fall to the ground and accumu-
late chronologically until reaching substantial thickness
over time. If these guano accumulations have not been
disturbed (trampled or mixed for instance), they can
constitute historical archives containing temporally situ-
ated information about bat populations, environmental
context, and human pressures.
2) Historical archives. The scientic literature does not
contain global long-term surveys of bat populations be-
fore the 1990s, for most of the >40 European species,
and most of the European countries. Bat decline was
rst reported in the literature in 1970, after some sci-
entists demonstrated that colonies of several species de-
creased or disappeared in all European countries. Before
the 1970s, scientists essentially focused on bat biology
and reproduction, and not on the dynamics of popula-
tions and their long-term health evolution. However,
some historical archives can help to reconstitute global
patterns of bat demography from the 1940s to nowadays.
Information about colony size, population distribution
range, and global demographic trends can be found in
atlases, national specialized journals, archives of natural
history museum reports or naturalist society reports,
etc.
3) Museum specimens. During the last decade, the use32 EvolDir September 1, 2019
of museum specimens for biological conservation pur-
poses has substantially increased, mainly due to the
advent of molecular genetic approaches. Because most
specimens stored in collections are from the 19th and
the beginning of the 20th Century, museum specimens
oer unique opportunities to quantify evolutionary or
microevolutionnary changes that occurred since the 19th
Century, for the reconstruction of population history.
Particularly, the study of gene pools in museum spec-
imens and nowadays samples can help to determine
whether a low genetic variability is the consequence of
recent population declines, or represents an ancestral
state.
REPAST will (i) use biological archives (both guano
accumulation and museum specimens) for reconstituting
the temporal dynamics of populations and environmen-
tal parameters explaining the loss of animal biodiver-
sity, (ii) use methods of monitoring that inform about
key population and environment features that scientists
failed to assess by regular monitoring over time. Overall,
the underlying hypothesis of REPAST is that one or
several stressors (habitat or climate changes, exposure
to pollutants) will be associated to temporal variations
of biological responses (pathogen prevalence, shift in
diet, genetic diversity, bat richness). The nature and
the pattern of this association (what stressor(s) is(are)
linked to what response(s) and how (from long and con-
tinuous associations to sudden shifts) will improve our
understanding of the mechanism(s) of bat decline. As
some past environmental stressors still persist nowadays,
this project will contribute to the prioritization of the
current threats to animal species and their habitats and
will ultimately guide conservation measures. This retro-
spective study will be used to parameterise predictive
scenarios of the evolution of animal

mont.GrassFloweringTimeEvolution
The Preston lab in the Department of Plant Biology at
the University of Vermont is seeking applicants to ll
two MSc/PhD positions on the evolution of temperate
grass owering time starting fall semester 2020. Work
in the Preston lab (https://jillpreston.weebly.com) aims
to elucidate important traits that have led to major
niche shifts over ecological time, and to decipher the
developmental and genetic basis of variation in these
traits. The main motivation is to better understand
potential constraints to future adaptation/exaptation
and plant breeding.
The positions will be funded by a mix of research and
teaching assistantships, and funding will be guaran-
teed over the 2+ year MSc/5+ year PhD timeframe,
given adequate progress of each candidate toward their

UWashington Coevolution
I am recruiting PhD students to join my start-
ing lab at UW, Seattle ( http://www.alejorico.com/-
Ecophysics Lab.html). If any of the research fronts
listed below resonates with your interests, please con-
tact me at colibri@uw.edu
1) Nectar-feeding animals as a study model to bridge
the gap between our knowledge of ecological and coevo-
lutionary patterns and their underlying mechanisms.
2) Studying plant-pollinator biomechanics, morphology,
and related physiological and natural history traits, to
link coevolutionary and speciation patterns to ecological
and genetic variation.
3) Understanding the selective pressures acting on sexu-
ally dimorphic traits, for instance in particular cases of
bill dimorphism (trade-os between ghting and nectar
extraction abilities), and more generally in the evolution
of intrasexually selected weapons across animals.
4) Deciphering the causal mechanisms for social dom-
inance and intra- plus inter-specic competition out-
comes, and how variation in behavioral strategies (e.g.,
interference vs. exploitative competition) maximizes net
energy gain.
5) Performing comparative studies along gradients from
trait development (e.g. weapons achieved only until
adulthood) and interindividual variation (e.g. polymor-
phisms), to parallel (e.g. independent appearances of
weapons in hummingbirds) and convergent (e.g. in other
nectar-feeding birds) evolution.
6) Quantifying the physiological and biomechanical
trade-os among hummingbird feeding, breathing, and
locomotion, that constrain the highest mass-specic
metabolic rates in vertebrates.
7) Technology and software development employing me-
chanical engineering, electronics, and computer vision,
among others, in order to pioneer methods to push the
current limits of the eld.
When you contact me, please describe why you would
like to join the Behavioral Ecophysics lab and attach
your CV (including contact info of up to 3 references).
The deadline for submitting the admission materials

UWesternAustralia Mixing Island
Mammal Pops
UWA is now accepting applications for international
PhD Scholarships, including graduates suited to this
project in the Mitchell lab:
Project title: Mixing mammal populations for conser-
vation Coordinating Supervisor: Dr Nicola Mitchell
Location: School of Biological Sciences, The University
of Western Australia, Perth, Australia
UWA's School of Biological Sciences (https://-
www.uwa.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-biological-
sciences) is home to almost 100 academic sta and 120
graduate students, and is ranked 1st in Australia and
in the top 50 in the world for Biological Sciences. The
PhD project forms a key component of a well-funded
research partnership between Australian museums,
conservation organisations and universities, and will
be co-supervised by Dr Kenny Travouillon (Western
Australian Museum) and Dr Kym Ottewell (Western
Australian Department of Biodiversity, Conservation
and Attractions).
Background: Remnant populations of many threatened
mammal species in Western Australia have been isolated
for between 50 - 8000 years. Substantial dierences in
body size, skull morphology and life history traits exist
among remnant populations, with some even recognized
as separate subspecies. Recently ( <20 years ago), some
of these populations were translocated and bred together
for conservation purposes. For at least one species, com-
parison of purebred vs hybrid individuals at a mixed
introduction site has revealed that body size dierences
between source populations has a strong genetic basis.
Whether such dierences reect divergent adaptation
or are eects of genetic drift is unclear. Managers are
concerned about outbreeding depression if distinctive
populations are to be mixed. Consequently we need
to reassess how distinct each population is before more
mixing is done. Comparing how mixed populations dif-
fer morphologically from the original populations will
be a large focus of this research, to help understand how
particular traits are passed on.
PhD project: You will use quantitative methods to
assess morphological dierences between remnant andSeptember 1, 2019 EvolDir 37
pre-decline populations of several mammal species. This
will involve measuring body size and skull shape (ob-
tained by three-dimensional morphometrics on CT-scans
of museum specimens) to infer phenotypic variation in
traits such as locomotion, diet, growth and predator
vulnerability. For some species, the genetic basis of vari-
ation can be assessed via annotated reference genomes.
Potentially, markers associated with trait genes could
be analysed, and their correlation with habitat and cli-
matic variables determined. The PhD student will be ex-
pected to play a central role in developing research ideas
and methods and should have a demonstrated capacity
for research (including publications) and a thorough
knowledge of statistical and programming software. A
background in morphometric analysis and/or genomics
is highly desirable.

VirginiaTech PoplarGenomics
Ph.D. assistantship available at Virginia Tech
The Holliday Lab in the Department of Forest Resources
and Environmental Conservation at Virginia Tech is
seeking an Ph.D. student for an NSF funded project
to study the genomics of hybridization in the Populus
genus.
Natural Populus hybrid zones provide a 'living labora-
tory' in which there has been a long history of natural se-
lection testing the genomic and phenotypic outcomes of
hybridization. We will sample across replicated Populus
hybrid zones to robustly capture the history of Genome
x Genome x Environment interactions along environ-
mental gradients, and couple this sampling with genome-
wide re-sequencing and computational approaches to
address the following questions: (i) How is introgression
arrayed across the genome and landscape? (ii) What ge-nomic regions control hybrid tness and what are their
environmental drivers? (iii) Can adaptive introgression
be recapitulated using controlled crosses? We will com-
bine extensive short and long-read genome resequencing
to exhaustively characterize genomic variation across
the hybrid zones. We will then use admixture mapping
to associate genomic ancestry with climate gradients
and adaptive phenotypes, predict hybrid performance
across a range of eld test sites, and evaluate the contri-
butions of environment and space in explaining patterns
of hybridization. Finally, we will test the repeatabil-
ity of hybrid outcomes using controlled crosses among
Populus species, assess the predictive value of the loci
identied as being involved in hybrid vigor/heterosis,
and assess the role of allele-specic expression in gen-
erating hybrid phenotypes. This project will provide
the most comprehensive picture to date of the genomics
of hybridization and heterosis in a tree species, and
enhance our understanding of the relationship between
introgression and tness across environments.
This project is a collaboration among four US universi-
ties, with each tackling a dierent aspect of the questions
above. At Virginia Tech, we will be particularly focused
on structural variation assessed using PacBio CCS. Can-
didates should have a background in evolutionary biol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, computational
biology, or a related eld, and be interested in learn-
ing the necessary computational and statistical tools to
complete this project. Some eld work will be necessary
as well, including evaluating poplar common gardens
near Virginia Tech, as well as potential travel to eld
sites in western North American for sampling.
Start date could either be spring or fall 2020, with
potential for a paid, temporary appointment prior to
enrollment. Please send expressions of interest and CV
to Dr. Jason Holliday (jah1@vt.edu).

Two PhD positions, Hawkesbury Institute for the Envi-

Two PhD scholarships are available to study life history
traits of Australian tephritid fruit ies from ecologi-
cal and evolutionary perspectives. Queensland fruit y
(Qy) is Australias most signicant horticultural pest.
Substantial eorts are currently placed on the devel-
opment of the sterile insect technique (SIT) for Qy.
However, there are still several knowledge gaps about
the biology and evolutionary ecology of this species, and
Australian tephritids more in general. Two PhD re-
search projects are currently available at HIE for highly
motivated candidates to investigate aspects of thermal
biology and life history traits of Qy.
One PhD project will investigate thermal biology, condi-September 1, 2019 EvolDir 39
tioning and sensitivity of Qy across its development in
the context of life history theory and SIT applications.
Exposure to dierent temperature regimes and extremes
during critical developmental stages of Qy (e.g. egg,
larva, pupa) will aect adult y tness and performance.
It can potentially prime Qy to withstand stress, or,
conversely, negatively aect tness, performance and
health (e.g. via viruses naturally present in some y
populations).
The other PhD project will investigate Qy pupation
biology and ecology. Pupation is part of complete meta-
morphosis and a key evolutionary innovation of insects,
with massive changes in morphology, physiology, mi-
crobiomes and behaviour. In nature, late Qy instar
larvae pupate in the soil, but little is known about
the details of Qy pupation biology and ecology. This
project will study Qy pupation biology and ecology
in natural environments, assess optimal densities and
climatic conditions in controlled environments, and test
alternative pupation substrates (sand and plant-derived
bres) for rearing of SIT Qy to evaluate their impact
on life history traits, performance and health.
Both PhD positions are based at the Hawkesbury cam-
pus of Western Sydney University in Richmond, in theSydney Basin and at the foothills of the Blue Mountains.
Our collaborating partners are Primary Industries and
Regions South Australia (PIRSA), the national SIT
Qy facility in Port Augusta and other research part-
ners. Since its foundation HIE has rapidly built a strong
research reputation in ecology and evolution, and a vi-
brant team of over 50 academic research scientists and
80 PhD students with access to a unique suite of world-
class research facilities and laboratories.

Dear Colleagues,
The Lamichhaney lab at Department of Biological Sci-
ences at Kent State University is seeking a full-time
Research Technician to join our team. The successful
applicant will provide assistance in setting up a new
molecular genetics lab and will be involved in research
projects that utilizes genomics methods to study adap-
tive evolution in birds.
Requirements for this position include,
- At least Bachelor's degree in molecular biology, biotech-
nology or related eld (master's degree preferred)
Additional relevant skills include
- At least one year's experience of working in a molecular
lab - Interest in doing eld-work if necessary - Some
experience with genomic techniques is preferred, but
not required - Good leadership, organizational, and
interpersonal skills
Application must include a cover letter describing ex-
perience and interest in the job, CV and names and
contact address of two references. Please send applica-
tions to Dr. Sangeet Lamichhaney (slamichh@kent.edu).
Review of applications will begin immediately and con-September 1, 2019 EvolDir 49
tinue until the position is lled. A highly competitive
salary plus annual leave and medical benets will be
oered.
A key question in evolutionary biology is to under-
stand how an organism responds to novel environments.
Such organismal persistence generally occurs through ge-
netic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity or combination
of these two processes. Ongoing research in Lamich-
haney lab focus on integrating cutting-edge comparative
'omics' tools (genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics,
proteomics and metabolomics) with knowledge about
ecology and natural history to explore relative roles of
phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation that un-
derlie an organism's response to changing environment.
We work with variety of animal systems including birds,
lizards, frogs and mammals.
Previous research in the lab has focused on understand-
ing the genetic basis of adaptive traits in vertebrates
ranging from sh (Atlantic herring), reptiles (squamates)
and birds (Darwin's nches & ru), both at micro and
macro-evolutionary scales. Specic research themes
include convergent evolution of traits and adaptive radi-
ation, role of structural variants in adaptive diversica-
tion, impact of interspecies gene ow on trait evolution
and hybrid speciation. Our previous work on the Dar-
win's nches for instance, represents an example of how
genomics can be eectively integrated with the long-
term eld studies on ecology and natural history to
reveal unique insights into genetic basis of adaptive ra-
diation in Darwin's nches that has been one of the
textbook example for variety of topics in evolutionary
biology.

Ecosystems and Global Change Group led by Dr
Andrew Tanentzap at the University of Cambridge
(www.ecosystemchange.com) is seeking a full-time Re-
search Laboratory Technician in Microbial Evolution.
The Technician will join an exciting new project funded
by the European Research Council investigating the
ecological and evolutionary importance of molecular
diversity in dissolved organic matter (DOM).
The main objective of the position is to support the daily
operation of a long-term evolution experiment. This
experiment aims to test how a model bacterium (Pseu-
domonas uorescens) adapts under dierent biogeochem-
ical conditions created by dierent DOM sources and
with competing Proteobacteria. More broadly, this ex-
periment will answer questions about the repeatability
and pace of evolutionary adaptation and how evolution-
ary responses vary with ecological interactions.
The Technician will initially be responsible for opti-
mising the experimental design (e.g. inoculum density,
growing conditions, competitor renewal), with the bulk
of the position spent maintaining the experimental cul-
tures, carrying out daily transfers into fresh media, and
regularly preserving colonies. Media will be amended
with DOM sourced from dierent European lakes, and
the Technician will have the opportunity to visit these
lakes to collect appropriate water samples. The Techni-
cian will also run regular competition assays to assess
the relative tness of preserved colonies. Finally, the
Technician will be expected to maintain and operate
laboratory equipment and support student and postdoc-

Senior Research Associate - Microbiota variation, tness
and senescence in the Seychelles warbler
University of East Anglia - School of Biological Sciences
Location: Norwich, UK Salary: 33,199 to 39,609 per
annum Closes: 5th September 2019 Job Ref: RA1630
Are you an ambitious researcher with expertise in evolu-
tionary ecology or microbiology, and an enthusiasm to
understand what drives individual variation in tness
within wild populations?
Fundamental gaps exist in our knowledge of the role
that the gut microbiota (GM) plays in the health and
evolution of its host. Indeed, we have very little under-
standing of the causes or - perhaps more importantly
- the consequences of individual GM variation within
natural populations.
This novel and exciting project now plans to use the
uniquely tractable system provided by the Seychelles
warbler to undertake a comprehensive investigation into
what determines individual GM variation - and how that
impacts reproduction, survival and senescence - within
a wild vertebrate population.
The Seychelles warbler system is an excellent modelas it provides a closed system (no migration in or out)
in which we can monitor all individuals - and key pa-
rameters of their varying environment - across their
entire lives. This includes longitudinal screening of
GM composition, measures of individual condition (in-
cluding telomere dynamics) and accurate measures of
reproductive success and survival (to estimate tness
and senescence). A molecularly-veried pedigree also
allows us to disentangle the inuence of genes and the
environment on the GM traits and tness components.
Candidates need to hold a PhD, or near completion
(or equivalent experience) in evolutionary biology, ecol-
ogy or microbiology, have an excellent understanding
of evolutionary concepts, expertise in the analysis of
complex data sets (including tness components and/or
microbiome diversity). Experience in molecular lab
work, statistics and bioinformatics would be benecial,
as would experience in (and enthusiasm for) eldwork
on animals, and be able to full all the essential criteria
in the person specication.
Based in Prof D.S. Richardson's (DSR) group in Biolog-
ical Sciences (BIO) at UEA (https://people.uea.ac.uk/-
david richardson), the PDRA will also collaborate with
Prof Matt Hutchings (MH: an expert in microbiol-
ogy). They will also be part of the international 'Sey-
chelles Warbler Project' team (http://seychelles-warbler-
project.group.shef.ac.uk) and work closely with Dr Han-
nah Dugdale https://hannahdugdale.wordpress.com/
(an expert on analysing tness and heritability in wild
populations). Within BIO they will actively partici-
pate in DSR's and MH's vibrant research groups and
in departmental activities, including research develop-
ment meetings, departmental seminars and journal clubs.
BIO provides excellent research facilities and oers a di-
verse and stimulating research environment with many
research groups working on questions related to this
project. The Norwich Research Park - home of BIO
- also hosts a number of other world-leading research
institutions including the Earlham Institute, the John
Innes Centre and the Quadram institute (which focuses
on gut biology and health)

months and is due to commence on 1 November 2019.

UKansas Tech EvolutionOfImmunity
Assistant Researcher position in the Unckless Lab at
the University of Kansas
The Unckless lab at the University of Kansas invites
applications for an assistant researcher that will focus
on the evolution of immune peptides. We recently found
that several Drosophila antimicrobial peptides show sig-
natures of balancing selection (the adaptive maintenance
of multiple alleles). This position would involve dis-
secting the mechanisms of balancing selection on these
peptides using a combination of approaches including
population genetics (examining signatures of balancing
selection on immune genes), genetics (allele replacement
using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing with subsequent
tness and infection assays), microbiology (minimum
inhibitory concentrations, zone of inhibition assays) and
biochemistry (structural and functional studies using
circular dichroism, NMR, etc.). The goal is to under-
stand how balancing selection maintains alleles from the
ecological to the biochemical level.
The successful candidate should have experience in some
of the approaches listed above and would be able to de-
velop skills in some of the other approaches. A bachelor's
degree in biology or a related eld is required.
The Unckless Lab studies evolutionary genetics in gen-
eral with a focus on the evolution of immunity and
selsh genetic elements (meiotic drive). The University
of Kansas is home to both the Department of Molecular
Biosciences and the Department of Ecology and Evolu-
tionary Biology and members of the lab interact directly
with other labs spanning biochemistry, microbiology,
genetics, genomics, evolution and ecology. Lawrence,
Kansas is a vibrant college town with plenty of good
food, cultural events and a wonderful downtown area.
The cost of living is very reasonable. We are about 45
minutes from Kansas City.

in 2018. The project started from 1st of September 2018
and will last for 5 years.
The proposed ERA Chair 'V the Center for Genomics,
Evolution and Medicine (cGEM), aims to apply advance-
ments in genomic medicine in an evolutionarily-aware
framework to account for dierent evolutionary path-
ways of populations which have led to dierences in
susceptibility to common diseases. cGEM group (http:/-
/cgem.ut.ee), led by Dr Anders Eriksson, was recently
formed with the goal to bridge the elds of bioinformat-
ics, evolutionary biology and genomic medicine. The
research in the cGEM ERA Chair group will be focussed
on combining tools and data from dierent disciplines
to gain insights into the genetic variation, regulatory
mechanisms for gene expression and gene-environment
interactions responsible for variation in complex human
traits and susceptibility to disease within and between
and populations, and translating these insights into
clinical practise and collaboration with industry.
Who do we need?

AgeSpecic variation data
We are seeking empirical data, published or unpub-
lished, on variance in reproductive success of individuals
of the same age and sex. Life tables typically include
age-specic survival and fecundity; we are interested in
a 3rd age-specic vital rate, which is the variance in
production of ospring among all same-age, same-sex
individuals in one year or reproductive season. For ex-
ample, from a standard life table you might nd that
males aged 6 produce an average of bx ospring. Weare interested in Vx, which is the variance in ospring
number of age-6 males around the mean of bx. Age-
specic variances in reproductive success are important
biologically but are reported less frequently than mean
fecundity and survival rate. The ratio Vx/bx has been
called the Index of Variability (Crow and Morton 1955
Evolution 9:202-214) and is a key determinant of eec-
tive population size, and Crow (1958 Human Biology
30:1-13) considered the ratio I = Vx/(bx ^2) = Index of
Total Selection to provide an upper limit to the rate of
evolution by natural selection.
The ratio Vx/bx is very sensitive to the value of bx,
so it is important that we scale the ratio to what it
would be in a stable population. This requires data on74 EvolDir September 1, 2019
age-specic survival, so the ideal datasets would have
age-specic data for bx, Vx, and survival. Nevertheless,
we can use raw values for bx and Vx if survival data
are not available. It is not necessary to have separate
data for both sexes, but that of course would be ideal.
For iteroparous species lifetime variance in reproductive
success is also a key parameter, but for this project we
are focusing on reproduction in one year or breeding
cycle.
We have already scoured the following sources: Clutton-
Brocks 1988 book on Reproductive Success; the 63 life
tables compiled by Waples et al. 2013 (PRSLB 280:
20131339); and the ~20 additional life tables compiled
by Fung and Waples (2017 Conservation Biology 31:883-
893), and we are using various keywords to search the
published literature. However, we expect that many
datasets like this will be hard to nd and wed like your
help locating them. We are particularly interested in
leads to unpublished or gray literature datasets, pro-
cessed reports, species status assessments, dissertations,
etc., that might contain useful information. Our pri-
mary interest is reproduction in natural populations.
Depending on the circumstances, captive breeding data
might be useful, but not data for programs where re-
production has been heavily managed (e.g., commercial
livestock or forestry).
Please send any data, leads, or suggestions for po-
tential data sources to Summer Ai (aixinransum-
mer@gmail.com). If you have any questions, please
contact Robin Waples (robin.waples@noaa.gov).

Dear EuroScitizen member,
We are glad to announce that evolution-themed outreach
activities survey is ready to be distributed widely.
The goal of this exploratory survey is to collect evolution-
themed outreach activities performed in any non-formal
education environment (museums, science centres, festi-
vals, online, etc.). Activities on formal education setting
can also be included. The survey will help us gather the
information for the pilot study of assessment of informal
learning environments in evolution education (WG3's
Deliverable 1).
The survey was created by EuroScitizen WG3 mem-
bers (Informal Educators) in collaboration with WG5
members (Scientists).
We would greatly appreciate if you could ll out the

SexSpecic GeneticVariation Data
Other: Unpublished data on sex-specic genetic varia-
tion
Dear Colleagues,
We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on sex-
specic genetic variances of tness components. Speci-
cally, we aim to test whether additive genetic variances
of reproductive success (and other tness correlates)
dier between males and females.
Because meta-analyses are often sensitive to publica-
tion bias, we are looking for unpublished datasets that
quantied genetic variances of both sexes within the
same experimental setup or eld population. Ideally,
the data should include sample size, mean estimate,76 EvolDir September 1, 2019
unstandardised genetic variance, coecient of variation,
and heritability estimates for both sexes.
If you have, or know of, such unpublished data sets, we
would love to hear about it. Moreover, we would be very
grateful if you could point us to published work that
provides this type of information but may go unnoticed
in database searches applying search terms like genetic
variation, heritability and reproductive success.

NESCentVideosCorrupted
Greetings,
Does anyone know what has happened to the \Tree
thinking challenges" youtube video produced by NES-
Cent way back when? https://www.youtube.com/-
watch?v=wkYLjmRX7mo It is an interactive series
of videos featuring some students/actors talking about
interpretation of phylogenetic trees. Embedded linksaddress various common misconceptions - it's kind of
fun, and I used to use it some of my courses, but upon
giving it a preview today, I nd that the link in the
introductory video doesn't appear. Maybe it has died?
Maybe youtube algorithms killed it? Any news would
be welcome - I still would nd it a useful educational
tool if it could be revived.
Happy to summarize and post any helpful responses-

Hello all,
Reposting position as forgot to add dates.
Title: Conservation Genomics Post-doctoral Researcher.
Deadlines: Position will remain open until lled, but
will likely begin reviewing applications at end of August,
and will begin to conduct interviews in Mid September.
Application material: The institution website is a bit
sparse but in addition to the application form, please
include your full CV, cover letter and a list of 3 refer-
ences.September 1, 2019 EvolDir 79
Application are accepted online (https://-
www.chicagobotanic.org/jobs/postdoctoral researcher)
BUT please also send pdf version of submission directly
to me (jfant@chicagobotanic.org) or an email to let me
know to look for your application.
Position Overview: We are looking for a postdoctoral
researcher with analytical skills in either, Population
Genetics, Genomics, Landscape Genetics or Molecular
Ecology. The ideal applicant will share our interests
in applying these analytical skills towards questions re-
lated to conservation, pollination ecology and/or habitat
fragmentation. Funding is secured for rst 12 months,
but there is a grant pending which would allow us to
extend this position for another 3 years (4 total). The
initial funding is for the postdoc to work with PIs to
complete the nal year of work on a NSF-funded Di-
mensions of Biodiversity grant titled \Landscapes of
linalool: scent-mediated diversication of owers and
moths across western North America". Data collection
for the project is largely complete (RADSeq and Hyb-
Seq), therefore they will primarily assist with population
genetic analysis of existing data, interpretation of re-
sults, and manuscript preparation, although depending
on the individual's interest, there are opportunities for
the post doc to develop an autonomous project within
the grant's objectives. If additional funding is secured,
the post doctoral researcher will transition over to a
project looking to identify best practices for manage-
ment of genetic diversity in botanic garden collections
for critically endangered species. The successful can-
didates will be based at the Chicago Botanic Garden,
and join a group of enthusiastic scientists focused on
addressing key conservation challenges. The Garden
and all its programs value diversity in all its forms and
are committed to ensuring a sense of belonging to ev-
ery individual we encounter, regardless of age, race,
gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, physi-
cal ability, intellectual ability, or economic status. We
anticipate a start date in Fall 2019. Job description

Cornell MarineEcolEvolGenomics
Postdoc in marine ecological & evolutionary genomics
The Hare Lab in the Department of Natural Resources
at Cornell University is recruiting a postdoc to lead
population genomic analyses for an NSF-funded project
to identify and spatially map balanced polymorphisms
underlying oyster tolerance to low salinity. We are test-
ing the hypothesis that short-term adaptive responses
to environmental stress can involve distinct genetic ar-
chitectures across a habitat gradient, even at spatial
scales with high gene ow. These predictions are for
the eastern oyster, a species in which high standing
genetic variation and low linkage disequilibrium facili-
tate testing for polygenic architectures. A rst goal for
this study is to identify candidate genes for tolerance to
low-salinity using whole-genome resequencing of experi-
mental challenge before/after samples, supported by an
available chromosome-level reference genome. Results
will inform models of evolutionary response to environ-
mental change as well as articial selection strategies in
breeding for aquaculture traits.
In general, this study is motivated by the expectation
that dispersing genotypes in high fecundity species will
have phenotype - environment mismatches resulting in
strong viability selection. As a result, functional genetic
dierentiation is generated across small-scale habitat
heterogeneities within each cohort. A second goal of
this project is to measure candidate gene variation along
the estuarine salinity gradient and test for associations
with salinity variation. Field sampling of Delaware Bay
eastern oysters will target larvae, newly-settled juveniles
and adults to measure the extent and spatial/temporal
pattern of recurrent within-generation selection. Oyster

Postdoc Position in Bioinformatics, Evolutionary Biol-

Matthew Meselson (Professor of Biology, Harvard), in
collaboration with Tim Sackton (Director of Bioinfor-
matics, Harvard FAS), has an opening for a postdoctoral
position to use long-read technology (Nanopore, PacBio,
10x) to better understand the unique biology of bdel-
loid rotifers. The position is available immediately, for
one year initially with possible extension dependent on
funding. Start date is exible.
The great majority of eukaryotes reproduce sexually,
either constitutively or facultatively, and nearly all that
are thought to be entirely asexual diverged only re-
cently from sexual relatives, suggesting that the loss
of sex leads to early extinction. Posing a challenge to
this generalization and to hypotheses for the evolution-
ary benet of sex are a few groups of ancient origin
in which, despite considerable study, sexual reproduc-
tion has never been observed { the so-called ancient
asexuals. The most extensively studied of these are
the rotifers of Class Bdelloidea. Although certainly
ancient, evidence for their asexuality is entirely neg-
ative { the failure, despite much observation, to nd
males. Using 10x and nanopore sequencing to obtain
phased genomic sequences of individuals of the bdelloid
rotiferMacrotrachela quadricornifera, the project would
conduct a critical test of recent population-genetic evi-
dence that bdelloids occasionally do reproduce sexually,
perhaps with meiosis of an atypical sort 'V a situation
possibly adapted to the unusual bdelloid life history
(Signorovitchet al. 2015. Genetics200:581-590).
Candidates must be procient in advanced bioinformatic

GenomicsMajorTransitions
Two postdoctoral positions, focused on genomics of
major transitions in evolution, are available for a trans-
Atlantic collaboration (sponsored by NERC-NSF) be-
tween the laboratories of Seirian Sumner (University
College London, UK) Amy Toth (Iowa State University,
USA) and Sandra Rehan (York University, Canada).
One position will be based in London and the other will
be based in Ames, Iowa, USA. Apply by August 15 for
full consideration.
Whats it all about?
Over 20 years ago, eight major transitions in evolution
that explain the emergence of biological complexity were
dened, one of which is the evolution of sociality (or
superorganismality). Signicant advances have been
made in understanding the theory underpinning major
evolutionary transitions; however, we lack an integrated
understanding of the evolutionary patterns and pro-
cesses of the major transitions. Through this project,
we have formulated a new predictive framework on the
molecular processes underpinning major transitions; the
predictions of this framework will be tested empirically
using multi-level genomic analyses of sociality in 16
species of bees and wasps.
What were looking for
The project is mostly computational, involving large-
scale comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses
of bee and wasp species that span the stages of the ma-
jor evolutionary transition from solitary to social living.Most of the datasets are already complete (and those
that are not will be complete by end of 2019), allowing
the postdoctoral team to get cracking in analysing data
to test hypotheses on how major transitions arise at
the level of the genes. The successful candidates will be
evolutionary biologists with proven track-records in the
use of genomic analyses and bioinformatics to address
broad evolutionary questions. An in-depth knowledge of
social insects and social evolution is not a pre-requisite,
but a curiosity about these topics, and a willingness to
learn about how and why they evolved, is essential.
Some things you need to know
The two postdocs will work concurrently (on 30 month
contracts), one based in the UK at UCL, and the other
in the USA at ISU. However, both postdocs will work
collaboratively and enjoy considerable mobility between
the labs of the three Investigators. These positions,
therefore, present excellent opportunities for networking
in three countries and world-class institutions and their
respective lab groups. The positions are available from
Sept 2019; successful candidates must be in post by end
of Nov 2019 at the latest.
Interested? Note that applications will be reviewed
concurrently for both positions, and you may apply for
both.

Montpellier TropicalForestEvolution
The AMAP lab (Montpellier, France) is seeking to ap-
point a post-doctoral researcher to work on the spatio-
temporal dynamics of Marantaceae forest, a presumably
stable state of degraded forest in central Africa. The
postdoc will be based at the main AMAP headquarter
in Montpellier, France, but will work in close collabora-
tion with the Forest and Society and ISEM labs, also in
Montpellier. She/He will also participate to eldwork in
the north of the Republic of Congo. The contract must
start on 01/12/2019 at the latest, with a duration of
12 months renewable once. The salary depends on the
experience of the postdoctoral researcher (gross monthly
salary of 2150 euro for juniors (2 years after phD)).
####Context
The spatio-temporal dynamics of forest degradation is
poorly known in the tropics, despite its importance for
understanding global biogeochemical cycles or for the
implementation of carbon mitigation strategies. For-
est degradation in the tropics has so far been mostly
studied from an ecological succession perspective, where
successional processes drive the system into a suppos-
edly stable and \mature" state. However, disturbances
may also produce deep and lasting modications of the
forest dynamics, pushing the system to bifurcate to an
alternative stable state or to an arrested succession. Our
project focuses on a system that probably corresponds
to such a stable degraded forest state in central Africa,92 EvolDir September 1, 2019
the Marantaceae forests. These forests exhibit a very
low tree density, almost no tree regeneration, a very low
oristic diversity and an impenetrable dense understory
composed of giant herbs ( >2 m) mostly belonging to
the Marantaceae (arrowroot) and Zingiberaceae (ginger)
families. They currently cover very large areas in cen-
tral Africa where they have been little explored, though
representing a critical issue for forest managers. Some
previous unpublished works suggest that these forests
are extremely stable in time, some likely resulting from
anthropogenic disturbances dated from more than 1000
years BP. Besides human disturbances, some Maran-
taceae forests established following extreme dry events.
Thus, under the on-going conjunction of climate change
and increasing anthropogenic disturbances, Marantaceae
forests are expected to expand at the expense of dense
mature forests with important consequences for forest
biodiversity, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem
services.
####Job description
The main objective of this postdoctoral project is
to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of the central
African Marantaceae forests in order to assess their
long-term stability and dynamics. Our overall approach
consists in combining local eld experiments, remote
sensing analyses and historical ecology approaches. The
post-doctoral fellow is intended to conduct an original
study from already available data including i) eld inven-
tories; ii) old (1950s) aerial photographs; iii) very high
resolution satelitte images and; iv) multiple UAV acqui-
sitions with passive images and LiDAR measurements.
The main idea is to use time series of remote sensing data
and multiple eld censuses to test whether Marantaceae
forests naturally increase in undisturbed (protected ar-
eas) and in disturbed (logged) forests and to assess
whether they constitute stable systems (i.e. whether
shifts from Marantaceae forests to closed-canopy forests
can be observed or not). The expected results will both
bring new insights on the conditions of stability of coex-
isting forest states, which so far have remained elusive,
and have strong implications for forest management and
conservation in central Africa.
####The team Our group is composed of c. 10 perma-
nent researchers and PhD students working in tropical
forest ecology and having extended eld experience in
Central African forests (see http://amap.cirad.fr/en/-
th11.php and http://amap.cirad.fr/en/th9.php). The
team also have a strong experience in remote sensing
of forest structure, including passive and active sen-
sors. We have our own integrated UAV systems with
multispectral cameras and a LiDAR sensor (see e.g.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxGAXC4cefQ).####Qualications We are seeking a post-doctoral
researcher (PhD required) in ecology, with a background
in remote sensing, or a researcher in remote sensing, with
a background on forest systems. The postdoc should
have strong data analysis skills (particularly in spatial
analyses) and must be uent in an interpreted language
(preferentially R). Good writing skills in english and
publication records are required. The candidate must
be able to work in a collaborative way.
####Applications Applicants should submit their CV
with publication list and statement of research interest
to both recrutement.dr-occitanie@ird.fr and

Postdoctoral Position in Infectious Disease Evolutionary
Genomics
*** In addition to the following specic project descrip-
tion, the Shapiro Lab (www.shapirolab.ca) is considering
postdoc candidates with broad interests in microbial
evolutionary genomics. Please contact Jesse Shapiro if
interested: jesse.shapiro@umontreal.ca ***
Description of the research: Pathogenic microbial or-
ganisms cause a signicant burden of disease, particu-
larly due to the problem of drug resistance, whereby
a pathogen no longer responds to treatment by one or
more available drugs. The availability of fast, reliable
and aordable whole-genome sequencing (WGS) meth-
ods has the potential to be a major boon for public
health authorities attempting to control the evolution of
drug resistance and the spread of epidemic outbreaks.
However, in order to fully harness the power of these
methods there is an urgent need for novel machine learn-
ing and algorithmic techniques for microbial WGS data.
Machine learning (in particular, deep learning) provides
a tool to predict and understand the relationship be-
tween drug resistance and genotype.
The successful applicant will develop and apply deep
learning methods for this task. The project will involve
developing new neural network strategies and architec-
tures and applying these methods to improve under-September 1, 2019 EvolDir 93
standing and treatment of drug resistance in bacterial
pathogens.
The candidate: The ideal candidate will have a PhD in
computational biology, statistics, applied mathematics,
or a related eld. The candidate should be a self-starter,
able to work independently and assist in supervising
MSc or PhD students. Experience working with genomic
data, and a knowledge of machine learning, GWAS, or
other relevant methodologies is an asset. The candidate
will be based in the Montreal area, but must be willing
to occasionally travel to the Vancouver location.
The oer: The position will be based in Montreal, QC
in the group of Jesse Shapiro (Universite de Montreal,
Biological Sciences Department), with frequent commu-
nication and occasional visits to Vancouver, BC to the
groups of Maxwell Libbrecht and Leonid Chindelevitch

Postdoctoral position in plant ecological and evolution-
ary genetics at Purdue University
A postdoctoral position is available in the Oakley lab at
Purdue University to study the genetic and physiological
mechanisms of tness tradeos across environments. We
use a combination of eld experiments in native habi-
tats and experiments in controlled growth chambers to
investigate the links between sequence polymorphism,
molecular phenotypes, organismal phenotypes, and ul-
timately, tness in contrasting environments. Current
and future work will incorporate transcriptomic and
metabolomic approaches to studying genotype by en-
vironment interactions for tness. Additional research
in the lab is focused on the evolutionary ecology and
genetic basis of heterosis and outbreeding depression.
Development of new research directions building on
these broad themes is strongly encouraged. There is
a vibrant community of interdisciplinary plant biolo-
gists at Purdue (https://ag.purdue.edu/cpb/faculty/),
providing ample opportunity for interaction and new
collaborations.
Research activities will include (but are not limited
to): Leading growth chamber experiments to estimate
freezing tolerance & lifetime tness, and combining this
data with dierential expression analyses using RNAseq;
eld planting and harvesting of experiments at sites in
Italy (near Rome) and northern Sweden (three to four
trips per year, ~10 days each); overseeing development
of CRISPR-CAS9 lines, near isogenic lines, two new
recombinant inbred line populations; data analysis; and
manuscript preparation.
A PhD in biology or related discipline is required and
preference will be given to candidates with a strong
background in plant evolutionary biology or plant genet-ics. The ideal candidate will have an interdisciplinary
skill set, having some combination of wet lab, bioinfor-
matic, and experimental biology experience. A strong
foundation in R, and at least a basic familiarity with
bioinformatic analysis on a cluster is strongly preferred.
This is initially a one-year appointment, with the pos-
sibility of an extension of another year dependent on
funding and performance. A start date sometime before
the end of 2019 is preferred, but this is negotiable.
Applicants should send (as a single PDF attachment):
CV, a letter summarizing research interests, accomplish-
ments, and t to the lab and project, and the names
and contact information for two professional references.

Hi Folks,
Our postdoc program is accepting applications for mul-
tiple dierent fellowships at the Smithsonian National
Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian Institution
Fellowship Program (SIFP), GGI Postdocs, and Burch
Postdocs). These positions are open to any invertebrate
zoologist with a PhD earned within the last six years.102 EvolDir September 1, 2019
In the SIFP there are also opportunities for graduate
students as there are in the Boss Fellowships (see below
link to information).
If you are interested in applying please contact me with
questions and include a short description of what you
would be interested in working on and how being at the
Smithsonian for that project would be essential.
I can support applications on any aspect of polychaete,
peracarid, or plankton research but am most inter-
ested in those that address questions of evolution in
the midwater. My lab has current research projects
on holopelagic polychaete evolution and biomechanics,
a multi-researcher project focused on the evolution of
visual systems in hyperiid amphipods, an opportunity to
use 30 years worth of midwater transect data to explore
ecological and population dynamics patterns of midwa-
ter animals, and opportunities to develop projects on
connectivity in the open ocean, methods of biodiversity
study in the open ocean, or deep sea acorn worm or
munnopsid isopod diversity.
The opportunities are summarized here because it can
be confusing which ones apply to you.

Postdoctoral Fellowship: conservation genomics, climate
resilience and restoration of southern African seagrasses
The von der Heyden lab at Stellenbosch University is
recruiting a postdoctoral fellow, for a fully funded NRF
postdoctoral fellowship. The successful applicant will
take a leading role in the newly funded \Project Sea-
Store: integrated research to support seagrass restora-
tion and to build estuarine resilience in South Africa",
that combines transcriptomic and functional diversity
in natural and experimental populations of the seagrass,
Zostera capensis, throughout its range. The project is
a collaboration involving Stellenbosch University (Profs
Sophie von der Heyden, Guy Midgley), Nelson Mandela
University (Prof Janine Adams), University of Cape
Town (Dr Deena Pillay) and the Knysna Basin Project
(Dr Louw Claassens).
The successful applicant will be based at the von der
Heyden Lab at Stellenbosch University, one of Africa's
leading marine research groups specializing in the use
of molecular tools to understand patterns and processes
driving southern Africa's rich marine biodiversity. We
are a dynamic lab, with a strong emphasis on research
excellence as well as student training and support. Our
work spans population genetics and phylogeography,
sheries management/stock identication, historical bio-
geography and the impacts of historical and contempo-
rary climate change on species distributions. To do this,
we utilise a wide range of tools including genomics and
environmental DNA, with our overarching goal of pro-
moting the integration of molecular tools into conserva-
tion and sustainable utilization of southern African ma-
rine species and resources. You can nd out more about
the von der Heyden lab and marine research at Stel-
lenbosch University here: www.vonderheydenlab.com
or via FB www.facebook.com/vonderheydenlab or on
Twitter: @vonderheydenlab or @ProjectSeaStore.
Applicants for the position will be hard-working, en-
thusiastic, independently motivated and willing to lead
a signicant part of Project SeaStore. A background

applicant would have some experience of transcriptomics
and have worked with natural and laboratory popula-
tions of seagrass (although this is not essential). A
background in bioinformatics (use of pipelines, ability
to work and write R scripts) is required. The project
includes a signicant eldwork component, so a valid
drivers license is required, as well as an ability to work

uses computational and statistical methods to inves-
tigate questions in human evolutionary genetics, in
particular on mutation rate, demographic inference
and archaic ancestry. A central aim in the lab is to
understand the impact of evolutionary history on
genetic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and disease. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human
history, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomicdatasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.
Required qualications: Ph.D. or equivalent in genetics,
genomics, computational biology or related elds and
demonstrated record of productivity and publications.
Experience with programming (e.g. C/C++, Python/
Perl, R or other programming languages), genomic data
analysis and methods development.
Please contact Priya with your CV and a brief overview
of research questions you are interested in pursuing.
Please also request three recommenders to send a letter
of reference on your behalf. The position is open until
lled with an anticipated start date in 2019/2020.
Salary: This is a multi-year postdoctoral position (initial
appointment is for 12 months and renewable annually
up to three more years). Salary is commensurate with
qualications and experience.

EvolGenomics MajorTransitions
This is a re-posting, we have extended the deadline for
applications for these postdoc positions to August 25.
Two postdoctoral positions, focused on genomics of
major transitions in evolution, are available for a trans-
Atlantic collaboration (sponsored by NERC-NSF) be-
tween the laboratories of Seirian Sumner (University
College London, UK) Amy Toth (Iowa State University,
USA) and Sandra Rehan (York University, Canada).
One position will be based in London and the other will
be based in Ames, Iowa, USA. Apply by August 25.
What's it all about?
Over 20 years ago, eight major transitions in evolution
that explain the emergence of biological complexity were
dened, one of which is the evolution of sociality (or
superorganismality). Signicant advances have been
made in understanding the theory underpinning major
evolutionary transitions; however, we lack an integrated
understanding of the evolutionary patterns and pro-
cesses of the major transitions. Through this project,
we have formulated a new predictive framework on the
molecular processes underpinning major transitions; the
predictions of this framework will be tested empirically
using multi-level genomic analyses of sociality in 16
species of bees and wasps.
What we're looking for
The project is mostly computational, involving large-
scale comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses
of bee and wasp species that span the stages of the ma-
jor evolutionary transition from solitary to social living.
Most of the datasets are already complete (and those
that are not will be complete by end of 2019), allowingthe postdoctoral team to get cracking in analysing data
to test hypotheses on how major transitions arise at
the level of the genes. The successful candidates will be
evolutionary biologists with proven track-records in the
use of genomic analyses and bioinformatics to address
broad evolutionary questions. An in-depth knowledge of
social insects and social evolution is not a pre-requisite,
but a curiosity about these topics, and a willingness to
learn about how and why they evolved, is essential.
Some things you need to know
The two postdocs will work concurrently (on 30 month
contracts), one based in the UK at UCL, and the other
in the USA at ISU. However, both postdocs will work
collaboratively and enjoy considerable mobility between
the labs of the three Investigators. These positions,
therefore, present excellent opportunities for networking
in three countries and world-class institutions and their
respective lab groups. The positions are available from
Sept 2019; successful candidates must be in post by end
of Nov 2019 at the latest.
Interested? Note that applications will be reviewed
concurrently for both positions, and you may apply for
both.

and are home to approximately 15,000 students and
2,500 members of sta. We operate on two campuses in
Joensuu and Kuopio. In international rankings, we are
ranked among the leading universities in the world.
The Faculty of Science and Forestry operates on the
Kuopio and Joensuu campuses of the University of East-

strategic research areas of the university. The faculty's
environments for research and learning are international,
modern and multidisciplinary. The faculty has approxi-
mately 3,800 Bachelor's and Master's degree students
and some 490 postgraduate students. The number of
sta amounts to 560. http://www.uef./en/lumet/-
etusivu We are now inviting applications for
a Postdoctoral Researcher (reproductive physiology, evo-
lutionary biology and biomedicine) position, Depart-
ment of Environmental and Biological Sciences, Joensuu
and/or Kuopio Campus (extended application period)
We are seeking a motivated Postdoctoral Researcher for
our project \Molecular and immunological basis of ga-
mete compatibility in humans" (funded by the Academy
of Finland, https://reprophys.weebly.com/).
According to the current denition of the World Health
Organization, the causes of human infertility are parti-112 EvolDir September 1, 2019
tioned into male- or female-dependent pathological fac-
tors. However, in a signicant proportion of cases, the
exact reason for infertility remains unexplained. Thus,
reliable assessment of human infertility is currently ex-
tremely challenging. The primary aim of the project is
to investigate the emerging possibility that reproductive
failure can also be a result of sexual selection at the level
of the gametes ('cryptic female choice'). Accordingly,
infertility does not necessarily represent a pathological
condition, but can also be a consequence of natural
compatibility verication processes of the gametes. Our
project investigates the molecular and immunological
mechanisms of these processes that occur in the repro-
ductive tract of the female prior to fertilization. By
clarifying these poorly known mechanisms, the project
aims to increase our understanding of the mechanistic
basis of fertilization and infertility, and pave the way
for increasingly accurate infertility diagnostics that are
better tailored to individual couples.
The Postdoctoral Researcher will participate in experi-
mental research that aims to clarify these mechanisms in
humans. Depending on the expertise of the researcher,
the duties can include either: 1) molecular and/or im-
munological analyses (e.g. next-generation sequencing,
Human Leucocyte Antigen analyses, protein mass spec-
trometry and cytokine analyses), 2) sperm motility
and chemotaxis measurements, or 3) determination of
female- and environmental exposure-induced physiologi-
cal changes in sperm. The researcher's tasks also include
data analysis and reporting of the results in scientic
journals.
The applicant is expected to have good skills in writ-
ten and spoken English. Earlier experience in labora-
tory work, relevant methods in cell biology (e.g. sperm
motility or viability analyses, ELISA assays or ow cy-
tometry), immunology or molecular biology (e.g. next-
generation sequencing or proteomics) will be considered
a benet for the applicant. If you have any of these
skills, please indicate them in the accompanying CV
and/or motivation letter (see below).
The person to be appointed as Postdoctoral Researcher
is expected to hold a doctoral degree from an applica-
ble eld. If the employee has been awarded his or her
doctoral degree less than ve years ago, the post will be
one of a Postdoctoral Researcher. If the doctoral degree
has been awarded more than ve years ago, the post
will be one of a Project Researcher. In this context, the
ve years refer to a net period of time, which does not
include maternity leaves, parental leaves, or military
service, etc.
English may be used as the language of instruction and
supervision in this position.The position is lled initially for a xed term from
1.10.2019 to 31.8.2020 (or as agreed), with a possibility
of extension when the follow-on funding from Academy
of Finland is conrmed. The position will be lled for a
xed term due to it pertaining to a specic project (po-

PostDoc: UGraz.EvolutionaryParasitolGenomics
 ^A>^A1
4PostDoc position available at the Institute of
Biology, University of Graz, Austria
We are seeking a highly motivated PostDoc to join the
project ^ADeep evolutionary genomics of Monogenea\
funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).
Qualications of the successful applicant: - PhD in
genetics, evolutionary biology or parasitology - strong
background in bioinformatics, with solid command of
at least one programming language - experience in
genome/transcriptome assembly, phylogenomics and/or
comparative genomics and ideally the use of High per-
formance computing infrastructure - strong publication
record demonstrating the above skills - experience with
developing and running pipelines/workows (e.g. Snake-
make) and the use of Docker/Singularity - ability to
mentor undergraduate and graduate students - previous
experience with ^Aparasitic worms' is a plus.
Project description: The Neodermata (Platyhelminthes)
are a highly diverse assemblage of obligate parasitic
atworms (estimated 40,000 - 100,000 species), compris-
ing Cestoda (tapeworms), Monogenea, and Trematoda
(ukes), many of biomedical, veterinary and economic
importance. Together, they span an impressive range
of hosts and parasitic lifestyles. Despite decades of re-
search, however, the relationships between the main
parasitic lineages remain contentious. Recent work hasSeptember 1, 2019 EvolDir 113
sought to resolve the controversy by means of phyloge-
nomic inference, but particularly Monogenea remain
vastly underrepresented in these datasets, despite their
importance and ubiquity. With their simple, direct life
cycles, monogeneans are key for understanding the shift
towards obligate parasitism of vertebrates, the evolu-
tionary history of ecto- and endoparasitism, and the
emergence of complex life cycles in Neodermata. We
will assemble draft genomes for 50+ representatives of
the Monogenea (Platyhelminthes; Neodermata), aim-
ing for complete coverage of all monogenean families,
based on a combination of short and long NGS read
data. Genes will be identied in the genome assemblies
using a combination of existing and newly generated
(RNAseq) physical evidence and ab initio gene predic-
tion. Phylogenetic relationships of the Neodermata and
especially the Monogenea, will be inferred based on the
newly assembled and previously published gene com-
plements. We will investigate patterns of gene/gene
family loss/expansion and conservation/disruption of
metabolic pathways associated with shifts in parasite
life history traits.

community dynamics after glacial retreat using environ-
mental DNA", that combines community ecology, envi-
ronmental DNA metabarcoding and a global approach
to understand the evolution of biotic communities in
recently deglaciated areas at an unprecedented detail,
and to understand the drivers of biotic colonization.
Research description
Glaciers show a pattern of retreat at the global scale.
Increasing areas are exposed and colonized by multiple
organisms, but lack of global studies hampers a com-
plete understanding of the future of recently deglaciated
terrains. What will be the fate of these areas? How
do animals, plants and microorganisms colonize them?
Which are the climatic, geological and biogeographical
processes determining colonization patterns?
The IceCommunities project is using environmental
DNA data to produce unprecedented, massive informa-
tion on the biodiversity of recently deglaciated terrains
at the global scale.
We are looking for candidates with a strong attitude
toward the use of advanced statistical techniques to
understand ecological processes. Applicants for the po-
sition will be hard-working, enthusiastic, independently
motivated and willing to lead a signicant part of the116 EvolDir September 1, 2019
IceCommunities Project, and will join a highly-dynamic
work group, with a strong emphasis on research excel-
lence.
A necessary prerequisite is experience in the use of
numerical ecology to assess relationships between envi-
ronmental variation and modications of biotic commu-
nities. Experience in spatial ecology will be welcomed.
Furthermore, the project is based on the use of molec-
ular data (DNA metabarcoding). Experience in the
analysis of metabarcoding data is not mandatory but
will be useful

The Shannon Potato Genomics and Breeding Lab at
University of Minnesota is looking for a computational
biology postdoc to work on the development and analy-
sis of large scale data sets related to the transformation
of potato into a diploid inbred-hybrid crop. Potato ge-
nomics has been limited by the complexity of the potato
genome. Potato is a highly heterozygous autotetraploid
which is propagated clonally. This genomic complexity
has also slowed potato breeding making many of the
tools which have been successful in other crops (inbreed-
ing, introgression of traits, etc.) inaccessible in potato.
The Shannon lab is part of a community wide eort to
develop inbred diploid potato lines with the benecial
alleles from the US tetraploid germplasm. We will be
genotyping and sequencing lines developed throughout
the process of diploid generation, selection, and inbred
line creation. This data will provide a unique opportu-
nity to elucidate haplotype structure and diversity in the
US potato germplasm, explore potato evolution throughSeptember 1, 2019 EvolDir 117
demographic inference, and identify deleterious alleles.
The project is a collaboration with Robin Buell and Dave
Douches at Michigan State University, and Je Endel-

grasses include diversity panels, mapping populations,
and common garden plantings. Our funded projects
leverage existing gardens spanning 10 locations across
the latitudinal species range of switchgrass (from Texas
to South Dakota). The candidate will likely be involved
in statistical genetic projects including genome-wide
complex trait analysis, genetic mapping (outbred QTL
and GWAS), and genomic selection in plant breeding.
The position requires a PhD in Evolution, Population
Genetics, Genomics, Statistical Genetics, Plant Biol-
ogy, Plant Breeding or a related eld. We are looking
for highly motivated candidates with excellent com-
munication skills, initiative, and enthusiasm for large

UTurku ElephantAgeing
\Post-doctoral position on senescence patterns and ageing
markers in Asian elephants.
The University of Turku is a world-class multidisci-
plinary research university which oers interesting chal-lenges and a unique vantage point to national and in-
ternational research and education.
A postdoctoral position focusing on senescence patterns
and ageing markers in Asian elephants will be available
under the supervision of Dr Sophie Reichert, and in
close collaboration with the large and multidisciplinary
Myanmar Timber Elephant Project of Prof. Virpi Lum-
maa at the Department of Biology, University of Turku,
Finland. The position is part of Dr Reicherts Academy
of Finland funded project to study the patterns of senes-
cence and reproductive senescence and identify their
underlying hormonal and ageing markers correlates, us-
ing a large longitudinal dataset on life-histories of a
semi-captive population of Asian elephants in Myan-
mar. The Myanmar Timber Elephant Project group
is highly cosmopolite and focuses on diverse domains
of biology (evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology,
ecophysiology, genomics).
More information about the groups project can be found
at: http://elephant-project.science/ . The project aims
to examine dierent mechanisms of ageing, such as
telomere dynamics and oxidative stress, combined with
the study of tness consequences of senescence to under-
stand ageing mechanisms and how they interact with
variation in lifelong health, reproductive history and
endocrinological measures of stress and reproductive
status in long-lived mammals.
The postdoc will take advantage of exceptional lifelong
demographic and health data recorded for the Myan-
mar timber elephants combined with data on a range
of correlates of ageing, condition, stress levels and re-
productive status to conduct a comprehensive study on
the links between reproductive investment and proxi-
mate correlates of reproductive and survival senescence.
The post-doctoral researcher will investigate changes in
annual health status of individual elephants, and how
these link to physiological measures of health, ageing
markers, reproductive success across life and longevity.
Asian elephants are endangered and both wild and cap-
tive populations are predicted to vanish from Myanmar
unless the vital rates improve.
Understanding health correlates of reproductive and
mortality rates thus aids developing management and
conservational policies.
The position allows for supervising Bachelor and Mas-
ter students as well as for applying for own funding,
and is thus a good opportunity for acquiring necessary
experience for applying for faculty positions afterwards.
Applicants should have a PhD in elds such as evolu-
tionary biology, ecology or ecophysiology.
Strong statistical skills, including extensive knowledge124 EvolDir September 1, 2019
in managing and analysing longitudinal datasets, as well
as excellent written and verbal communication skills in
English, evidenced by a good publication record in lead-
ing journals in the eld, are a must. Some lab experience
(telomere and oxidative stress analyses and/or hormonal
analyses) would be a plus.
The position is for 22 months and should start at the lat-
est the 1 st of November 2019. The successful candidate
will have the possibility to apply to further Finnish /
European funding to pursue the project past the present
contract.
There will be a trial period of 6 months.
The salary will be determined in accordance with the
Finnish university salary system for teaching and re-
search personnel, and consists of two components: a
work-specic salary component reecting how demand-
ing the position is, and a performance component re-
ecting an evaluation of the position-holders personal
achievement. The salary for post-doctoral researchers
is in accordance with the University salary system for
teaching and research personnel levels 4V6 where the
work-specic salary component is between 2535,20 -
3423,25 euros per month. The component based on
personal performance adds a minimum of 6 % and a
maximum of 50 % to the base salary. Applications
should be accompanied by a max 2 pages motivation
letter (describing applicant&#39;s research interests,
qualications and reasons for applying), a CV, a list of
publications, a copy of diploma of the degrees, addresses
of 3 potential academic referees and other documents
that may aect to the selection need to be attached
to the application. Application deadline is on Friday
13.9.2019. The applications must be submitted via the
electronic application form of the University of Turku.

DrosophilaExperimentalEvolution
Experimental Evolution in Drosophila
A postdoctoral position is available at the Institute of
Population Genetics, Vetmeduni Vienna (Austria). The
research focus of the Institute of Population Genetics
is on understanding the genetics of adaptation. This
central question in evolutionary biology is being tackled
using up-to-date methods and a variety of approaches,
including experimental evolution, quantitative genet-
ics, functional genetics, empirical population genetics,
bioinformatics and statistics.
The successful candidate will be part of a team of sci-
entists studying adaptation of experimental Drosophila
populations to temperature stress. Since our experi-
mental evolution study is performed under controlled
environmental conditions with a high level of replication
we have a powerful system to successfully employ a com-
bination of DNA sequencing, RNA-Seq, metabolomics
and high-level phenotyping to characterize the archi-
tecture of adaptation in an out-crossing species. With
some of our populations approaching 200 generations,
this project provides the opportunity to follow adaptive
trajectories through time.
We are looking for a candidate with excellent quantita-
tive training and experience in handling large data sets.
A background in population genetics and/or experience
with the analysis of RNA-Seq and Pool-Seq data are a
bonus. We are mainly targeting applicants with a keen126 EvolDir September 1, 2019
interest to take advantage of highly replicated genomic
time series data to understand polygenic adaptation,
but candidates interested to study the co-evolution of
microbiome and host genome are also invited to apply.
The successful applicant will supervise a team of techni-
cians to collect high-level phenotypes (e.g. respiration,
behavior, metabolism etc.).
Upon outstanding performance, a group leader position
can be oered to establish her/his independent research
at the institute.
The position is available for at least two years
starting October 2019, but the exact starting
date is negotiable. The application should be
emailed to christian.schloetterer@vetmeduni.ac.at

Course: Comparative Genomics (2nd edition)
Where: Free University Berlin (Germany)
When: 7-11 October 2019
Instructors:
Dr Fritz J. Sedlazeck (https://fritzsedlazeck.github.io/)
Prof. Dr. Ingo Ebersberger (https:/-
/scholar.google.com/citations?user=-
LOOY3kYAAAAJ&hl=en)
Course overview
We will cover a broad range of software and analy-
sis workows that extend over the spectrum from as-
sembling and annotating eukaryotic genomes, via the
identication of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
structural variants (SVs) within the population, to the
assessment of their likely functional impact of the de-
tected variants in an evolutionary context.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at researchers interested in learn-
ing how to compare genomes and what can be learned
from genomic similarities as well as variations. It will
include information useful for both beginners and moreadvanced users. We will start by introducing general
concepts of comparative genomics. On this basis, we
will then continue to describe all major analysis steps
from the raw sequencing data via the identication of
variations to an assessment of their impact on the phe-
notype.
Attendees should have a background in biology. There
will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practical ex-
ercises using command line Linux. We will therefore
dedicate one session to introduce basic and advanced
Linux concepts for processing data on Amazon cloud
(AWS). Attendees should have also some familiarity with
genomic data such as that arising from NGS sequencing
experiments.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
Setting up a comparative genomics analysis environment
with the CONDA package management system Identi-
cation of SNPs and SVs using de novo genome assembly
and read mapping strategies Assessment of strengths
and weaknesses of the dierent DNA sequencing tech-
nologies, Illumina, Pacic Bioscience, Oxford Nanopore,
for the detection of variations Strengths and pitfalls of
de novo assembly and mapping approaches for compar-
ative genomics Hands on experience of state of the art
methods to compare multiple genomes Annotation of
variations and comparative genomics analysis Familiar-
ity with biological sequence analysis in an evolutionary
context

https://www.researchgate.net/prole/Filippo Biscarini
This course is very suitable for those interested in learn-
ing how to make use of genomic information to study
how selection has shaped the genome and how the
genome inuences measurable phenotypes.
The course comprises two approaches: one based only
on genomic information, which will use populations ge-
netics techniques to detect signatures of selection (both
natural and articial); the other approach will combine
genomic and phenotypic data to identify genetic associ-
ations for specic phenotypes (i.e. GWAS, genome-wide
association studies).

9thDNAmetabarcodingSchool
Sept31-Oct6
DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method for as-
sessing biodiversity from environmental DNA and bulk
samples. It has a wide range of applications: biodiver-
sity monitoring, animal diet assessment, reconstruction
of paleo communities, among others. DNA metabarcod-
ing uses molecular techniques such as PCR and next
generation sequencing, and requires a broad range of
skills, as it integrates molecular biology, bioinformatics,
biostatistics, and ecology.
The DNA metabarcoding spring school is now in its
ninth edition. This year, it is co-organized and funded
by the metabarcoding.org team, Grow Colombia, the
Instituto de Investigaci on de Recursos Biol ogicos Alexan-
der von Humboldt, the Andes University, the Earlham
Institute and Ecopetrol in Colombia
The DNA metabarcoding school will be held from Oc-
tober the 31st at Bogota and from November the 1st to
the 6th, 2019 at Villa de Leyva
All lectures and practicals will be presented in English.
The symposium is open to anyone on the basis of a
simple registration at the symposium registration. Can-
didates for the lectures and practicals must apply by
email to the following address:
colombia2019@metabarcoding.org
Before noon Colombia time on September the 20th, 2019
For the application to the school the email must con-
tain a brief curriculum vitae and a letter of motivation
(one page max) indicating how the applicant's research
will benet from DNA metabarcoding and what (s)he
is hoping to learn from this school. As part of the
course, participants will have to give a ash talk (5
minutes) about their research and how it is related to
DNA metabarcoding. The number of participants to
the lectures and practicals of this school is limited to 24.
It is compulsory for the participants to the lectures and
practicals to also attend the Symposium. The selected

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the course 'GEO-
GRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS WITH R:
USING R AS GIS (GREECE)'.
Instructors: Dr. Neftal Sillero (Centro de Investiga cao
em Ci^ encias Geo-Espaciais Portugal) and Dr. A. M arcia
Barbosa (CIBIO-InBIO, University of Evora Portugal)
Dates: November 20th-22nd, 2019 Location: Crete,
Greece
COURSE OVERVIEW:
A Geographical Information System is a set of data,
tools, software and hardware, designed to store, man-
age, visualise, analyse, and represent spatial data, either
in vector (points, lines, polygons) or raster (image, pix-
els) format. GIS is behind many activities of our world:
from Google Earth and Maps, GPS navigation manage-
ment of logistic and transportation services, land-cover
maps such as CORINE, territorial planning, production
of topographical maps and other thematic cartographies,
to natural risk analyses and calculation of species' po-
tential distributions. Every activity using spatial data
needs a GIS.
Do you know how to work with spatial data? Do you
need to use a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
but you cannot buy professional software? Do not worry,
there are many alternatives to freeware GIS that are
at least as good as the professional solutions. However,
it is not so well-known that you can use the famous
programming language R as a GIS tool.
This course will teach you the basic theory and practice
of GIS using R. By the end of this 3-day practical course,
you will have the capacity to visualise, map, and analyse
spatial data, in vector as well as raster format .
This course is orientated to PhD and MSc students, as
well as other students and researchers working on any
discipline using spatial data.
This course will be mainly practical, with some theo-
retical lectures. All spatial processes and analyses will
be performed with R, which is free and open-source
software and allows automated and fully reproducible
workows. Students will learn to import dierent types
of spatial data, visualise the data, perform spatial anal-September 1, 2019 EvolDir 133
yses, and represent the results in thematic maps.
PROGRAM: Wednesday, November 20th, 2019.
- Theory: Introduction to GIS. - Practical: Introduc-
tion to GIS with R: Import and plot data. - Theory:
Cartography. - Practical: Cartographic projections.
Thursday, November 21st, 2019.
- Theory: Vector G database base operations. - Prac-
tical: Attribute and spatial queries: join/merge, l-

Dear evoldir members,
Transmitting Science is oering the course 'INTRODUC-
TION TO ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELLING'.
Instructor: Dr. Neftal Sillero (Centro de Investiga cao
em Ci^ encias Geo-Espaciais Portugal) Dates: November
25th-29th, 2019 Location: Crete, Greece
COURSE OVERVIEW:
This course will teach you the base theory of ecological
niche modelling and its main methodologies. By the end
of this 5-day practical course, you will have the capacity
to perform ecological niche models and understand their
results. You will be able to choose and apply the correct
methodology depending in the aim of your study and
type of datasets.
Ecological niche, species distribution, habitat distribu-
tion, or climatic envelope models are dierent names
for similar mechanistic or correlative models, empirical
or mathematical approaches to the ecological niche of
a species, where dierent types of ecogeographical vari-
ables (environmental, topographical, human) are related
with species physiological data or geographical locations,
in order to identify the factors limiting and dening the
species' niche. ENMs have become popular due to the
need for eciency in the design and implementation ofconservation management.
The course will be mainly practical, with some theoret-
ical lectures. All modelling processes and calculations
will be performed with R, the free software environment
for statistical computing and graphics ( http://www.r-
project.org/). Students will learn to use modelling
algorithms like Maxent, Bioclim, Domain, and logis-
tic regressions, and R packages for computing ENMs
like Dismo and Biomod2. Also, students will learn to
compare dierent ecological niche models with Ecospat
package.

EnvironmentalDNA Nov4-7
Workshop: Using environmental DNA for surveys and
monitoring
Dates: November 4-7, 2019
Location: The Wilds Conservation Science Training
Center, Cumberland OH
Instructor: Dr. Stephen Spear, Director of Wildlife
Ecology at The Wilds
Environmental DNA is increasingly used as a monitor-
ing tool for aquatic and even some terrestrial species.
This 4 day workshop will provide a detailed introduction
to eDNA methodology and how to apply the method
into a monitoring framework. The workshop will com-
bine lecture components with hands-on lab exercises.
The workshop is geared toward focal species eDNA
monitoring, although metabarcoding approaches will be
demonstrated and discussed.
The following topics will be included:
* Overview of eDNA case studies using both water and
soil sampling
* Collection and ltering of water and soil samples in
the eld
* Designing primers for species-specic amplication
* Laboratory extraction and amplication of eDNA sam-
ples using qPCR and metabarcoding primers134 EvolDir September 1, 2019
* Interpreting results and analytical tools for using eDNA
in monitoring programs.
At the end of the workshop, each participant will have
collected, extracted, and analyzed their own eDNA sam-
ples. Participants will also work in groups to design
and implement a small eDNA research study during the
course of the week.
This workshop is targeted toward both professionals
and graduate students with limited rst-hand experi-
ence with eDNA that are looking to learn more about
the method or develop their own eDNA projects. No
previous experience is required, although some prior
experience in either genetic techniques or monitoring
methods would be helpful.
The course will be located at The Wilds (https://-
thewilds.columbuszoo.org), a 10,000 acre AZA conser-
vation center located approximately 90 miles east of
Columbus. Our facilities include a low-copy DNA
lab, a general lab, classroom, Eastern hellbender
conservation center, and many lakes and streams.
Housing is available at the Wilds cabins at Straker
Lake (https://thewilds.columbuszoo.org/home/visit/-
stay-overnight/the-wilds-cabins-at-straker-lake). A lim-
ited number of spaces at our Conservation Science Train-
ing Center cabins will be available for students on a
rst-come, rst-serve basis. Food service will not be
available at The Wilds during the workshop, although
each cabin comes with a kitchen that will allow partici-
pants to prepare their own meals.
Workshop fees and costs: The fee for the workshop is
$700 for professionals and $500 for students. Hous-
ing at the cabins at Straker lake is an additional
$100/room/night (each cabin has 3 rooms). Limited
student housing at the CSTC cabins is available for
$62.50 for the entire week.

Edinburgh Metagenomics Aug28
Dear All
We have some spaces remaining on our brand new course:
Metagenomics and Metabarcoding
When: 28 - 30 August 2019
Where: Peter Wilson Building (Room G155), The King's
Buildings, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh,
Scotland, UK
Instructors: Urmi Trivedi, Bioinformatician, Edinburgh
Genomics; Amanda Warr, Research Geneticist, Roslin
Institute; Rob Stewart , Bioinformatician, Roslin Insti-tute; Albert Phillimore, Institute of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, University of Edinburgh (guest lecturer); Nathan
Medd, Training and Outreach Manager, Edinburgh Ge-
nomics (demonstrator)
Description: The ability to identify organisms from
traces of genetic material in environmental samples has
reshaped the way we see life on earth. Especially for mi-
croorganisms, where traditional identication is hard or
near impossible, metagenomic techniques have granted
us unprecedented insight into the microbiome of animals
and the environment more broadly.
This course focuses on the computational methods used
to analyse the wealth of data produced by shotgun
metagenomics and metabarcoding (Amplicon targeted
metagenomics) studies.
This course will provide you the insights to the DNA
metabarcoding analyses from preprocessing and quality
control of the raw data to the construction of OTU/ASV
tables, taxon assignment, diversity analysis and dier-
ential abundance analysis using QIIME2. Further, you
will also learn about methods to generate the reference-
based prole to generate microbial community features
like taxonomic abundances or functional prole and how
to identify the ones characterizing dierences between
two biological conditions.
You will then be introduced to methods used for as-
sembly from metagenomics samples. Attendees will
use tools to assemble metagenome assembled genomes
(MAGs) from short read and long read data. We will
discuss the dierent approaches and tools available for
these assemblies and the benets and limitations of each
options.
Cost: £500

Deadline to apply: August 15th, 2019.NCGAS is oering a three-day workshop on high per-
formance computing (HPC) usage and metagenomic
analysis. It will take place in October 7th to 9th, 2019
at Indiana University, Bloomington campus. Registra-
tion is free, but application is required.
The workshop will include discussions, lectures and
hands-on tutorials, to cover topics important to con-
structing and analyzing metagenomic datasets. Mate-
rial covers availability of HPC resources, and how to
access these resources, while learning how to assemble
and annotate metagenomics datasets. The goal of this
workshop is to provide a comprehensive preparation for
metagenomic analysis and other bioinformatic tasks.
This workshop will include the basic steps in metage-
nomic analysis - to assemble and annotate the datasets
to identify taxa and function. In addition, we will dis-
cuss how to install programs locally, and other resources
that support further downstream analysis to answer var-
ious research questions. While the material will make
heavy use of XSEDE and IU machines, the material is
transferable to any cluster.

Kiel EukaryoticGenomeAnnotation
Sep19
You can still sign-up for the free training course on
EUKARYOTIC GENOME ANNOTATION in Kiel, on
September 19th 2019
COURSE OVERVIEW:
The constant drop in sequencing prices and the develop-
ment of easy-to-use assembly programs makes it possible,
even for small groups, to embark on a de novo genome
project to obtain the full sequence of their species of
interest. However, automatically annotating all genetic
features in a eukaryotic genome, especially in non-model
species with few or no sequenced closely related species,
remains a challenge and standard pipelines still do not
exist.
In this one day course participants will learn about these
challenges and the current strategies that can be used
to try to obtain the most complete set of genes from
a de novo assembled eukaryotic genome. We will also
discuss how additional data, such as RNA-seq, assem-
bled transcriptomes or proteomic data, can be used to
improve the annotation, which can inform decisions on
how best to spend the budget during a genome project.
The practical part of the course will explain how to
automatically and manually annotate a genomic region
and how that information can be immediately translated
into biologically relevant data for the species of interest.

Nantucket PhylogeneticDevelopeR
Nov5-8
Dear colleagues.
We are very happy to announce the 2nd edition of a
graduate-level workshop on phylogenetic method devel-
opment R. The course will be four days in length and
take place at the University of Massachusetts Boston's
Nantucket Field Station from the 5th to the 8th of
November, 2019. The workshop is intended for (and
open to) anyone from an evolutionary biologist with
interest in phylogenetic methods and a little prior com-
puter programming experience, to an intermediate or
advanced computational biologist curious about honing
their skills in R development for phylogenetics.
On the rst 2.5 days of the workshop, course leaders
Drs. April Wright, Josef Uyeda, Klaus Schliep, Claudia
Sol s-Lemus, & Liam Revell will provide an introduction
to the primary data structures and methods of common
phylogenetic R packages, the basics of computational
algorithms for phylogenies, and an overview of other
essential topics of software development in R (version
control, unit testing, documentation, and R package
development), the specic details of which will depend
on the prior experience of the bootcamp participants.
Over the subsequent 1.5 workshop days participants
will work in break-out groups with workshop leaders toSeptember 1, 2019 EvolDir 139
develop small R packages on their chosen topics. These
projects will focus on adding new functionality to exist-
ing R software in phylogenetics, and might range from
tree manipulation, to phylogenetic inference, to com-
parative methods, to phylogenetic simulations, to the
visualization of phylogenies or macroevolutionary data
on trees.
The workshop is funded by awards from the National Sci-
ence Foundation to Dr. Liam Revell (NSF DEB-1350474
and DBI-1759940), with additional support from the
University of Massachusetts Boston. All accepted stu-
dents originating from a U.S. port of origin will have
their travel costs covered or defrayed, and room and
board during the workshop will be provided. As the
workshop will be held at a eld station, accommodation
is comfortable, but basic, and participants should be
prepared to stay in multiple occupancy rooms.
To apply for the course, please complete a Google
form that can be found at the following link: http://-
www.phytools.org/nantucket2019/apply.html. Details
of relevant programming background (computer lan-
guages, R knowledge, GitHub repositories, ...) should
also be provided. Admission is competitive, and pref-
erence will go towards students with background in
evolutionary biology, basic to moderate experience in
computer programming (ability to read a data le into
R or a similar language and parse it for information,
familiarity with iteration and functions, ability to iden-
tify when to use basic datatypes such as vectors and
dataframes, and comfort with using help documentation
to nd answers), and a compelling motivation for taking
the course. Applications should be submitted the google
form by September 10, 2019. Questions can be directed

Dear EvolDir community,
The Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics is
now accepting applications for the course \Experimental
evolution: bringing theory and practice together" at the
University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, December
2-6, 2019.
Experimental evolution is extensively used to address
questions of evolutionary biology by exposing evolv-
ing populations to dierent environmental conditions.
It oers the opportunity to replicate experiments and
test for convergent outcomes. With the recent drop in
DNA sequencing cost and the advance of sequencing
technologies, the combination of experimental evolution
with next generation sequencing of pools of individuals
(Evolve & Resequence) has become a state-of-the-art
method to link phenotypic responses to genetic changes.
Although the availability of replicated time series data
is one key advantage of E&R, the analysis of such data
sets is still in its infancy. This course will introduce the
participants to several new approaches for the analysis
of genomic time series data covering the latest software
tools as well as required statistical and computational
skills. The course is targeted towards researchers inter-
ested in experimental evolution combined with NGS and
will cover the design of experimental evolution studies
as well as the analysis of Pool-Seq time series data. The
course aims to introduce participants to:
- State-of-the-art software packages - Modeling of neu-
tral data - Identifying selected regions - Comparison
of n-point analysis with time series data - Haplotypes
reconstruction from time-series data - Inferring linkage
structure of Pool-Seq data - Estimating selection coef-
cients - Calling transposable elements in time series
data - Inferring selection in transcriptomics data
Morning lectures by internationally renowned faculty
will be followed by computer practicals on the analysis
of experimental evolution data in the afternoon.

WichitaStateU PlantGenomics
Are you interested in learning more about plant ge-
nomics and bioinformatics? Do you work in one of these
EPSCoR states/territories?
Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Guam, Hawaii,
Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, US Virgin Islands,
West Virginia, Wyoming
If so, we encourage you to apply for a position in a
recently funded EPSCoR plant genomics research and
training network, the Consortium for Plant INvasion
Genomics (CPING). CPING aims to 1) better under-
stand plant invasion by investigating 5 major North
American invasive species and 2) enhance genomics re-
search and teaching in EPSCoR jurisdictions through
training and research opportunities. Aim 2 will bring
in a large number of botanists and plant biologists in
EPSCoR jurisdictions who would like to improve their
genomics and bioinformatics skills. Although many par-
ticipants will be assistant/associate professors, funding
for undergraduate students is also available. All partici-pants will attend a summer short course where they will
learn fundamental genomics and bioinformatics meth-
ods. There will also be opportunities for all participants
to pursue independent research projects, collect data
that will support collaborative projects, and participate
in annual network-wide symposia.
Don't be bashful! There are opportunities for re-
searchers at all skill and experience levels. We expect
many applications from researchers that are currently
using 'rst generation' genetic techniques (Sanger se-
quencing, microsatellites, etc.) but that haven't made
the jump to 'next-generation' and beyond genomic tools.
However, we are also eager to include researchers at
primarily teaching institutions who have limited oppor-
tunity to conduct primary research.
If you have interest in this opportunity, or would simply
like to learn more, please complete the brief survey at
the link below. There's no commitment at this point.
Also, PLEASE help us spread the word by sending this
to colleagues in EPSCoR jurisdictions who might be
interested in learning plant genomics tools for teach-
ing and research. In the meantime, please email me
(james.beck@wichita.edu) with any and all questions.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only142 EvolDir September 1, 2019
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
