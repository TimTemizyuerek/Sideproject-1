10th International Macrostomum Meeting: Evolution
and Development in the free-living atworm genus
Macrostomum
We are happy to announce that we will hold the \10th
International Macrostomum Meeting" (10th IMM) here
in Basel. The meeting will last from the evening of
Friday, 25.11.2016 at 18:00 to the evening of Sunday,
27.11.2016 at around 16:00.
With the \First International Macrostomum Meeting",
which took place in 2007, also in Basel, we have started
a tradition of bringing together annually the community
of researchers that are either using atworms of the
genus Macrostomum in their research or who are other-
wise interested in research on these interesting model
organisms.
The topics of contributed talks and posters will likely
span aging, bioadhesion, development, evolution, pro-
teomics, genomics, karyology, regeneration, physiology,
taxonomy, phylogenetics and sexual selection. It is a
great opportunity to get an update on what is happen-
ing in the Macrostomum Community, and to establish
personal contacts if you want to start working on these
lovely worms.
As before, we want to keep things very simple and we
expect everyone to be prepared to cover their own costs.
In addition, we will, during the meeting, collect a small
fee to cover sandwich lunches, refreshments and a joint
dinner on Saturday evening (60 Euros in total). For
students we can try to nd oor space accommodation
in the apartments of people in our group (just bring
along a mat and a sleeping bag). Please let us know if
you would like to be accommodated in this way (see the
form below). We'll do what we can.
The other people should make a hotel reservation soon,
because there are many fairs in Basel, and hotels can ll
up quickly. A good option is the Hotel Rochat (http:/-
/www.hotelrochat.ch), where we routinely host guests
that visit our department, and which is just ve minutes
by foot from the Institute. Please contact them directly
to make your arrangements/payments.
For people coming by plane, please note
that Easyjet (http://www.easyjet.com), Swiss
(http://www.swiss.com), and AirBerlin (http://-www.airberlin.com/) are ying to Basel (http://-
www.euroairport.com/en/) from many European
destinations.
If you would like to attend the meeting (and present
a poster or talk) please ll out and return the form
below to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch until 30. October at
the latest.
Hopefully see you soon in Basel,

*GENETICS OF MIGRATION*
Tuesday 4th April - Friday 7th April 2017
Venue: Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology,
Pl on, Germany
We are pleased to announce that a symposium on the
Genetics of Migration will be held at the Max Planck
Institute of Evolutionary Biology (Pl on, Germany) in
spring 2017 (April 4th-7th).
The aim of the symposium is to bring together a multi-
disciplinary group of scientists working on the ecology,
genomics, epigenetics, evolutionary theory and biostatis-
tics of animal migration. The development of next
generation sequencing technology and improvements in
tracking the movement of migratory species is certain
to advance this eld of science in the coming years so
now is an excellent time to synthesize what we currently
understand about the genetic basis of migration as well
as highlight future avenues of research. The symposium
will be based on a series of talks, posters, workshops
and discussions and will encompass a wide range of
migratory taxa including birds, sh and insects.
Keynote speakers:
Jochen Wolf - Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich
Claudia Bank - Gulbenkian Institute Guojie Zhang -
Beijing Genomics Institute/University of Copenhagen
Melinda Baerwald - University of California, Davis
Nancy Chen - University of California, Davis Christine

Nov25 AbstDueOct28
Reminder - abstracts due Friday - 28 October
Encourage all the budding systematists you know to
come. And come yourself! You'll see great work in its
early stages, and make excellent contacts with the most
enthusiastic young scientists in our eld. We do ask
you to register even if you are only attending and not
presenting.
18th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
Friday, 25 November 2016, 9:30 am Venue: Flett Lecture
Theatre, Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists' Forum represents an
exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE. Send applications by e-mail to
(YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com), supplying
your name, contact address and stating whether or
not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than Friday 28 October 2016. The body text
should not exceed 150 words in length. Title, authors,
and their professional aliations should be included
with the abstracts. If the presentation is co-authored,
the actual speaker (oral) or presenter (poster) must be
clearly indicated in BOLD text.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

Stockholm ScandinavianOrigins
Nov7-8 RegistrationOpen
Dear all,
Registration is now open for the Symposium on the
\Origins and Natural History of the Scandinavian Biota"taking place 7-8 November 2016, at the Swedish Museum
of Natural History in Stockholm.
The deadline for registration is on October 16th.
Scandinavia was covered by a large ice sheet during the
last glacial maximum, which means most modern-day
animals, plants and humans have a recent origin in the
region. But their origins and subsequent history have
until recently remained unresolved.
The Swedish Museum of Natural History invites you
to a symposium where some of the world's leading
researchers in genetics, paleobiology and archaeology
present the latest research results on the origins and
natural history of the Scandinavian biota.
The following speakers will present their research: Inger

AdaptationToEnvironmentalStress
The Aarhus Insect Adaptation Lab <https:/-
/sorensenlab.wordpress.com/ > (https://-
sorensenlab.wordpress.com/) seeks a strongly motivated
and passionate Ph.D candidate to join the Section for
Genetics, Ecology & Evolution at the Department of
Bioscience, beginning early 2017. Applicants will work
on Environmental stress adaptation in invertebrates
and have background experience within molecular
biology, genomics, ecophysiology, evolutionary biology,
or entomology. Note application deadline 1st November
2016.
Research area and project description:
The successful applicant will participate in the Depart-
ment's work on evolution, ecophysiology and molecular
biology with emphasis on adaptation to thermal stress,
responses to thermal stress (acclimation and harden-
ing) and the molecular mechanisms underlying these
adaptive responses. The work includes studies of mem-
brane lipids, gene expression, protein expression and
sequence analysis, but also whole-organism studies of
performance, mainly on the Drosophila model. Detailed
studies of stress responses have shown that organisms
have developed sophisticated physiological adaptations
to combat environmental stress.
The project aims to identify and investigate candidate
systems for studying thermal adaptation and responses.
For example, several investigations point to a connection
between thermal adaptation and genes associated with
vision and phototransduction. To achieve the aim of the
project a focus on molecular investigations combined
with information from population level and physiologywill be applied to achieve an integrated functional under-
standing. The work will be done under the supervision
of Assoc. Prof. Jesper Givskov Srensen (AU), sup-
ported by a grant from Aarhus University Research
Foundation.

Bangor eDNA PollenHayfever
Fully funded competitive PhD Studentship ( £14,296pa)
- Using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to explore
aerial pollen communities and identify links to hay fever
(Lead supervisor: Prof. Simon Creer).
Did you ever wonder what species of grass pollen where
responsible for causing hayfever this PhD aims to use
eDNA analysis and modelling to nd out.
We are currently advertising for a PhD opportunity to be
hosted in the Molecular Ecology & Fisheries Genetics
Laboratory (MEFGL), at Bangor University (http:/-
/mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/) to commence in October 2017.
The PhD is part of the NERC ENVISION Doctoral
Training Program (http://www.envision-dtp.org/), a
PhD consortium partnership between Bangor, Notting-
ham and Lancaster Universities, alongside numerous
environmental bodies, aimed at equipping the next gen-
eration of Environmental Biologists with advanced skills.
Project rationale: Bioaerosols consist of biota such as
pollen, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses and include
plant allergens that negatively aect human health. Ap-proximately 20% of people display allergic reactions to
combinations of tree and grass pollen causing symptoms
ranging from discomfort (e.g. hay fever) to respiratory
complications (e.g. asthma), with associated costs to
society and health services. Identifying pollen from
dierent species of tree can be achieved using labour-
intensive microscopy, but the process is challenging and
can be subjective. Nevertheless, since most grass pollens
look the same, an outstanding challenge is to understand
which species of grass contribute to the allergic response.
Aims: This studentship has three components. The
rst aims to use dierent combinations of molecular
genetic tools to see how eectively we can assess aerial
tree pollen mixtures. Secondly, to use modelling ap-
proaches to compare and contrast the aerial transit of
tree and grass pollens and nally, to identify which
species of grass pollen are linked with hay fever symp-
tons. The PhD will form a distinct, but highly com-
plementary component within a larger £1.2M NERC
funded study (#PollerGEN) and provides an opportu-
nity to work with a leading team of interdisciplinary
molecular ecologists, aerobiological modellers and envi-
ronmental epidemiologists from a range of UK Univer-
sities and the UK Met Oce. Co-supervision will be
provided by Natasha DeVere/Gareth Grith (Aberyst-
wyth), Carsten Skjth (Worcester), Ben Wheeler/Nick
Osborne (Exeter/Sydney).
Training will be provided in the main areas of molecular
ecology, genomics, taxonomy, bioinformatics, modelling;
multidisciplinarity skills and science communication,
complemented by a host of additional opportunities for
postgraduate development. Fieldwork will occur within
the UK, with opportunities for travel/collaborations in
Europe and Australia.
Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Honours
Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in subjects such as
Environmental or Natural Sciences, with a strong moti-
vation to study eDNA biodiversity-environment eects.

Life history consequences of nest site selection in birds
PhD studentship based in Hungary & the UK, 2017-2020
Supervisors: Dr A Kosztol anyi (Univ Vet Med Budapest,
Hungary), Prof Z Barta (Univ Debrecen, Hungary) and
Prof T Sz ekely (Univ Bath, UK)
Choosing nest sites is a major life history decision, since
the location of nest inuences both the risk of predation
and the thermal properties of eggs, nest and the incubat-
ing parent. This PhD project will focus on shorebirds
that nest on the ground. Our previous research has
showed that some plovers nest in the open whereas oth-
ers nest under small bushes. However, it is not known
why these consistent individual dierences (i.e. animal
personalities) exist, how they relate to other personal-
ity traits (e.g. boldness, neophobia) and whether the
costs and benets of the dierent nesting strategies vary
under dierent climatic conditions where the plovers
breed.November 1, 2016 EvolDir 15
The PhD student will investigate the interaction be-
tween consistency in nest site selection and climate, and
the life-history consequences of this interaction. The
student will test (i) how consistent are the individuals
in their nest site selection under hotter and milder cli-
mates, (ii) whether the nesting personality correlates
with other personality traits (e.g. bolder individuals
nests in open area), and (iii) how nest site selection
inuences reproductive success and survival.
The ideal candidate has a strong interest in evolutionary
biology, behavioural ecology and eld biology, and will-
ing to work in remote areas in Madagascar, Cape Verde
or Mexico. He/she need to have solid background in
data analyses preferably in R, and statistical modelling.
We are seeking candidates willing to raise their own
funding. Note that for students from eligible countries
the Stipendium Hungaricum oers a scholarship pro-
gramme (www.stipendiumhungaricum.hu). A condition
of the application is a Master degree (or equivalent) in
biology, zoology or similar subject.
Interested candidates should contact the lead supervisor,
Dr Andr as Kosztol anyi (Kosztolanyi.Andras@univet.hu).
Applications that include a CV (max 3 pages) and a
max 2 page cover letter with personal motivation and
the name and contact details of two references should
be sent to Dr Kosztol anyi. Deadline of application: 1
January 2017.

Biosciences at Cardi University:
Is food availability and choice a limiting factor for de-
clining UK Hawnch populations?
To apply go to: http://courses.cardi.ac.uk/funding/-
R2590.html Project description: Hawnches in the UK
have declined over the past 40 years and the breeding
range has contracted to a few well-wooded locations
in western Britain. Changes in food availability are
suspected as one cause. For example, hawnches were
once pests in traditional stone fruit orchards, but such
orchards have largely disappeared. They are dispersed
foragers, specialising on the seeds of trees which are
patchy in time and space, and roost communally, which
may allow them to exchange information about the
status and location of food resources. They can move
hundreds of kilometres between seasons in relation to
variation in food availability, and have recentlybeen
found to move over a scale of several kilometres during
the breeding season.
This PhD aims to investigate whether food resources
are a limiting factor for hawnch populations in the
UK, and whether landscape-scale habitat manipulations
could be used as a conservation tool. It will characterise
the current diet of Hawnches, map the distribution of
potential food resources and investigate the interplay
between food resources and climate. The current diet in
the UK will be investigated using molecular techniques
(Next Generation Sequencing of faecal DNA)to iden-
tify both plant and invertebrate components. This will
be based on faecal samples collected by the Hawnch-
Study Network coordinated by RSPB, when they were
widespread, and also from contemporary faecal samples
from continental Europe where populations are stable.
These results will be used to identify what the key food
resources are and how this changes through the year.
The dispersed nature of dierent food sources means that
this species forages over large areas across patchy land-
scapes. Understanding how food sources are distributed,
and foraging behaviour, will be essential. RSPB is cur-
rently trialling the use of GPS tags to investigate short
term local foraging patterns. The student will createa
tree species map of the study area based on classi-
cation of remote sensing LiDAR and reectance data
to investigate the distribution and abundance of key16 EvolDir November 1, 2016
tree species that have been shown to be exploited by
Hawnches from the diet analysis. The combination
of identication of key food resources, resource distri-
bution and behavioural foraging data can be used to
identify options for improving forest management to
benet hawnches.
Finally, the student will examine whether landscape and
climate correlates of population change could relate to
changes in abundance or fruiting of key food resources
identied. Spatially explicit estimates of change in abun-
dance between time periods is available from BTO bird
distribution atlases covering both the breeding season
and winter.
Training: The student will obtain the broad rangeof
training experience needed for modern conservation
work, integrating both lab (molecular diagnostics, bioin-
formatics, tree species mapping) and eld skills (survey
work, bird handling, faecal sampling, remote sensing),
thereby developing skills to ll gaps in the UK's research
capacity.
Associated Partners: Thestudent will collaborate with
partners at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
(RSPB) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
(CEH), where opportunities to build new links will be
encouraged, as well as engage with the development of
skills relevant to practical conservation using cutting
edge technologies (e.g. LIDAR).

DrexelU AntAndAphidMicrobiomes
The Russell lab at Drexel University seeks strongly mo-
tivated and passionate Ph.D candidates to join them in
the Department of Biology for the Fall of 2017. The best18 EvolDir November 1, 2016
applicants will have background experience in molecular
ecology, genomics, evolutionary biology, or entomology.
Students will work on one of two systems:
1. A 46-million year old nutritional symbiosis between
Cephalotes turtle ants and their symbiotic gut bacteria.
2. Symbioses between defensive bacteria, aphids, and
their natural enemies.
For both projects, graduate student research will ex-
plore symbiont diversity at both the taxonomic and
functional scales. Research in both system uses genomic
tools to understand symbiont function and evolution.
Experimentation is also utilized in both systems, which
are tractable for study in the eld and the laboratory.
While work on the ant symbiosis will be focused on elu-
cidating symbiont function and evolutionary history,
research on aphids will focus on antagonistic evolu-
tion between aphids natural enemies (wasps and fungal
pathogens). Alternatively, aphid research could focus on
the mechanisms underlying strong community structure
of symbiotic bacteria. FISH microscopy and bioinfor-
matics will be among the tools utilized for both lines of
research, and both are supported by strong infrastruc-
ture and opportunities for training at Drexel.
Collaborators on both projects come from other de-
partments at Drexel and renowned institutions beyond,
providing access to a wide network with diverse exper-
tise. Through Jake Russell's joint appointment with
Drexel's Biodiversity, Earth, and Environmental Sci-
ences department, students will interact with a broad
range of faculty and other grad students with interests in
organismal biology, systematics, ecology, and evolution.

2hD projects on the evolutionary ecology of infec-

Sept 2017. Projectsill use the fruit y Drosophila
melanogaster and its viral and bacterial pathogens as a
model system of systemic and enteric infections. Thepe-
cic topic can be discussed with individual candidates,
but should align with the following interests:
///Project 1.he impact of maternally acquired micro-
biota on physiological and behavioural immunity in
Drosophila///
Background Recentvidence suggests that the transgener-
ational transfer of gut microbiota in invertebrates could
play an important role in maternally-derived immunity.
Gut microbiota is known to alter host physiology and
behaviour but also play a key role in intestinal immune
priming and in the defence against pathogenic infections
in a number of invertebrates. In addition to a protective
eect during the life of an organism, intestinal micro-
biota may also participate in transgenerational immu-
nity in the next generation. In the fruit y Drosophila
melanogaster, females ensure transmission of their own
microbiota by seeding the embryonic eggshell, which is
eaten by the hatched larva.
Theroject Thisroject will investigate the interaction be-
tween D. melanogaster, its microbiota and pathogens at
the inter-generational scale. By using a combination of
maternal and ospring infection and microbiota treat-
ments, and by comparing specic combinations of these
treatments, we will be able to test the role of maternally
transmitted gut microbiota on ospring health and its
ability to respond to infection.

Background Theruit y Drosophila melanogaster is an
important laboratory model for viral pathogenesis and
antiviral immunity in invertebrates. However, while
we are starting to uncover something of the ecological
dynamics of viruses in Drosophila, we still know very
little about the tness costs of infection, and thus the
selective pressure these viruses impose. This is all the
more striking because population genetic data suggest
viruses may be a particularly strong driver of adaptive
evolution in Drosophila. Nora viruses are ideally suited
to this study. Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus is
common in wild (and laboratory) ies, it is known to
infect the gut epithelium (where it causes detectable
pathology and may impair gut integrity), and to be
naturally transmitted through a faecal-oral route.
Theroject Focusingn the Nora viruses, this project will
investigate how infection in the wild and the lab is as-
sociated with tness and traits likely to be correlated
with tness. In the lab, this will include assessment of
the impact of infection on behaviour (sleep, courtship),
nutrition (feeding rate, gut integrity, faecal shedding),
reproduction (mating competition, fecundity), and sur-
vival. In wild ies it will be possible to associate repro-
ductive status with infection status, and wild-collected
ies can be studied to understand genetic variance for
resistance in the wild.

ETHZurich Eawag
PathogenEvolution
A PhD student position is available in the group of
aquatic ecology at ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology Zurich) / Eawag (Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Research), Switzerland
to study natural selection on immune function at gene
expression level. Parasites present a serious threat for
natural populations of free-living species. Immune de-
fence is generally considered as an important trait in
determining organisms' tness as it eliminates harmful
parasites. Therefore, understanding the evolution of
immune defence is one of the key topics in predicting
dynamics of host-parasite interactions. However, knowl-
edge on the type and strength of selection on immune
defence traits is very limited. The goals of the project
are to assess (1) the type and strength of natural se-
lection on the expression of several immune defence
genes/pathways, (2) variation in selection imposed by
infection risk, (3) trade-os related to immune activity,
and (4) local adaptation of hosts to parasites in the
wild. The study system is a freshwater snail Lymnaea

We are looking for a graduate student to join our re-
search group beginning in fall semester 2017. The
student would develop an independent research focus
in line with ongoing lab projects. We are exploring
how plant traits relate to community structure and
function of fungi (e.g., decomposition, pathenogenisis)
using culturing and next generation sequencing tech-
niques and the consequences of these interactions for
the forest carbon cycle in locations around the globe
as climate changes. Additionally, we are looking at the
evolution, ecology and physiology of plants across en-
vironmental gradients in various locations around the
globe. The student would join an interactive lab group
(http://www.phylodiversity.net/azanne/) that broadly
focuses on plant and microbe structure and function
(anatomy and physiological ecology), community ecol-
ogy, and evolutionary ecology, both in the temperate
and tropical areas. The graduate work will be com-
pleted at George Washington University. Washington,
DC is a dynamic city with a wealth of ecologists and
evolutionary biologists. We have strong links to area
institutions, including the Smithsonian. George Wash-
ington University is located in the heart of DC, with
easy access to numerous science, conservation, and pol-

PHD STUDENTSHIP: EFFECTS OF EVOLUTION
ON BACTERIOPLANKTON METACOMMUNITY
STRUCTURE
GENERAL THEME: While ecological processes are rel-
ative well-studied in bacterial metacommunities, the
relative importance of evolution in shaping bacterial
communities is unknown. Using laboratory experiments
with well-characterized bacterial species and genotypes,
we want to get insight into how and to what extent
rapid evolutionary changes in resource use of bacteri-
oplankton taxa associated with ecological release im-24 EvolDir November 1, 2016
pact subsequent microbial assembly and metacommu-
nity structure. This PhD project will be embedded in
an FWO project and the following questions will be
addressed: (i) does competitive release lead to evolution
of carbon source use in bacterioplankton lineages; (ii)
does evolution of carbon source use as a function of com-
munity composition subsequently impacts community
assembly trajectories; and (iii) does evolution of carbon
source use as a function of community composition has
the potential to impact metacommunity structure and
trait distribution patterns at the metacommunity level.
However, candidates are also encouraged to develop and
pursue their own ideas within this project.
PRACTICAL WORK: This project involves microbio-
logical laboratory work including culturing, genetic char-
acterization and phenotyping of pure isolates, optimizing
experimental protocols, common garden evolution and
community experiments, high-throughput Illumina se-
quencing, and in silico metacommunity analyses. We
have excellent research facilities with well-equipped mi-
crobiology and DNA laboratories. Additionally to the
laboratory work, the candidate will analyze and publish
the results.
PROFILE: Master in Biology or related eld with an
excellent academic record, and a strong proven interest
in microbiology and experimental evolutionary ecology.
Good knowledge of English and proven skills in micro-
biological and/or genetic techniques are required.
OFFER: A full time job initially for a period of one
year, but extendable to a total of ca. 2.5 years pending
good evaluation. However, applying for further fund-
ing is a prerequisite and if successful will extend the
position to a full 4-year PhD position. Leuven (http://-
www.leuven.be) is a nice historical university city with
a very high and pleasant standard of living. The his-
toric university, founded in 1425, has a top research and
teaching standard (http://www.kuleuven.be/english).
You will be embedded in an international, enthusiastic

phological stasis is the result of constraining selection
(in a constant environment), and not gene ow.

Two PhD positions - \Evolution and adaptation of bio-
logical clocks"
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen,
Germany
The Max Planck Research Group \Biological Clocks"
(http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/biologicalclocks) combines
evolutionary genomics and molecular biology with be-
havioral experiments and ecological eldwork, aiming to
uncover the yet unknown molecular basis of circalunar
clocks. At the same time, we study the process of evolu-
tionary adaptation. Our model organism, the intertidal
midge Clunio marinus (Diptera), has timed its life cycle
to the rhythm of the tides using circalunar and circadian
clocks. As the tides dier along the coastline, the clocks
of Clunio populations are genetically adapted to the
local pattern of the tides. We have shown that these
evolutionary adaptations can be exploited for compara-
tive genomic and molecular studies in order to identify
new clock molecules (Nature, in press).
Project 126 EvolDir November 1, 2016
This project focuses on the analysis of >250 Clunio
genomes from several strains which dier in various
aspects of their circalunar clocks. The aim is to iden-
tify the genes controlling these dierences. As some of
these strains occur in the same locality, the project also
addresses evolutionary questions regarding sympatric
ecological divergence with gene ow and the forces main-
taining local adaptation.
The ideal candidate holds an MSc or equivalent in a bio-
logical discipline with a strong background in genomics
or bioinformatics. Programming skills are required. Ex-
perience in comparative genomics, population genomics
or quantitative genetics are great assets. The student
should be communicative and open to collaborate across
projects in the group. Participation in project-related
eldwork and laboratory work is very welcome.
Project 2
In the Baltic Sea and in Northern Norway Clunio has
lost circalunar timing. This project will try to identify
the genetic variants underlying this secondary and pos-
sibly convergent loss of circalunar clocks. The work will
range from eldwork to establishment and experimental
characterization of laboratory strains, to genomic anal-
yses. An extension to functional molecular analysis is
possible.
The ideal candidate holds an MSc or equivalent in a
biological discipline with a strong background in evolu-
tionary genomics, quantitative genetics or (molecular)
ecology. Experience with (marine) eldwork, genotyping
and genetic mapping are assets. The candidate must be
well-organized and communicative in order to deal with
collaboration partners and hosts in Norway, Sweden and
Finland. A driving license is required, a boat driving
license would be a plus.
Both positions will be oered for 3 years with the possi-
bility of extension. Starting date is negotiable between
January and July 2017.
Applications should include a cover letter describing
your motivation to work on the respective project and
your relevant experience, a detailed CV and copies of
relevant certicates, and the contact details of three aca-
demic referees. Please send the above as a single PDF

MonashU MitochondriaAndLifeHis-
toryEvolution
PhD in mito-nuclear ecology
A fully-funded position (salary and research costs) is
available in the research group of Dr Damian Dowling
to investigate evolutionary adaptation within the mito-
chondrial genome and the consequences for the evolution
of life-histories.
\Mito-nuclear ecology" is a rapidly emerging eld, which
has grown from the realization that the genes inside of
our energy-producing mitochondria, may make surpris-
ingly large contributions to the evolutionary dynamics
of populations.
The project will integrate techniques and experimental
designs drawn from evolutionary biology, ecology, ge-
nomics and physiology. The project will be conducted
using genetic strains of fruit ies, in which dierent
mtDNA haplotypes have been placed alongside con-
trolled nuclear genomic backgrounds. These strains
provide a perfect tool to explore the eects of the mi-
tochondrial genotype on fundamental evolutionary pro-
cesses - such as adaptation to changing climates, the
evolution of ageing, and speciation.
Furthermore, because the mitochondrial genome is ma-
ternally inherited (males do not pass their mtDNA onto
their ospring), natural selection will be ineective at
eliminating male-harming mutations from the mtDNA
sequence when these mutations are benign or benecial
in females. Therefore, mitochondrial genomes are pre-
dicted to accumulate \male-harming but female-friendly"
variation, and thus contribute to evolutionary conict
between the sexes, and the evolution of sex dierences.
There will be full exibility for the successful applicant
to pursue their own academic ideas and interests within
the scope of the project.
Successful applicants will be highly motivated and pas-
sionate about evolutionary biology; familiar with basic
evolutionary concepts, have strong quantitative skills
and basic molecular skills.
The applicant will join a vibrant research group com-
prised of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers,
perfect for the pursuit of academic excellence and pro-
fessional development, with access to state-of-the-art
technology platforms for the study of evolutionary ecol-ogy and genomics.
The positions include funding for international and na-
tional conference visits, and for all research costs. The
successful applicant will be awarded a scholarship that
covers salary (current rate is $26,288 tax-free per year),
and full waiver of fees, and can choose to supplement
their salary through teaching assistance during under-

Stephen Cameron is looking for two graduate stu-
dents (PhD or MS) to join his research group at Pur-
due University Department of Entomology (https://-
www.entm.purdue.edu/prospective-grads/index.html )
to work on the evolutionary biology of insects. Dr.
Cameron's lab specializes in insect mitochondrial ge-
nomics, both using genomes for evolutionary inference
and understanding the factors that drive genomic evolu-
tion in dierent insect groups. He is also very interested
in evolutionary drivers of insect diversication (why are
there so many bugs?). Current projects include: 1) the
evolution of Thysanoptera (thrips) and their genomic
adaptations to sociality; 2) how genomes adapt to major
transitions in life history (e.g. herbivores vs saprovores;
ighted vs ightless insects etc.); and 3) mitochondrial
genome evolution in insects with abnormal sexual sys-
tems. However, Dr. Cameron would also be interested
in talking about any insect evolution related projects
students may propose.
Students with an interest in phylogenomics, compara-
tive phylogenetics, or insect evolution are encouraged
to apply. A background in any of these areas would be
great, but is not required.
Four years of support are available for PhD stu-
dents and two years for MS students, through grad-
uate research fellowships that include a tuition waiver,
health benets and a competitive stipend. The
Department of Entomology oers travel awards to
visit the Purdue campus and meet with prospective
faculty mentors (https://ag.purdue.edu/entm/pdfs/-
Grad asstPurdueAug24.pdf), while the University, Col-
lege and Department oer a wide variety of graduate
assistantships and fellowships. Travel award applica-
tions must be received by December 16th, graduate
awards have various deadlines from January to mid-
March. Purdue University is an EO/EA/AA employer.
If you are interested, please send a CV and a short state-
ment of your research interests (less than 500 words) to

/post.queensu.ca/ ~birdpop/index.html As numerically
dominant apex predators, seabirds are key components
of Canada's arctic marine ecosystem. Seabirds and
their eggs also are important to the culture and diet
of indigenous Arctic peoples. However, Arctic seabird
populations are facing multiple simultaneous direct and
indirect threats from climate change, shipping and in-
dustrial development. Unsurprisingly, many populations
are showing signs of stress such as reduced reproduc-
tive success or declining numbers. To avoid extinction,
wildlife populations must adapt through (1) changes in
behaviour or physiology, (2) dispersal, or (3) genetic
changes. The capacity for seabirds to adapt through
these three avenues is virtually unknown, but it is criti-
cal to maintenance of healthy populations. New genomic
methods, especially when combined with on-going stud-
ies of behaviour and physiology, provide powerful oppor-
tunities to determine the long-term sensitivities of Arctic
seabirds to climate change and industrial development.
We will use genomic, behavioural and ecological data
in a landscape context to estimate levels of phenotypic
plasticity, dispersal, and genomic variation for seven
seabird species that Canada has a global responsibility
to protect. Results will help Environment and Climate
Change Canada (ECCC) develop science-based policies
for Arctic stewardship. Students will be responsiblefor analyses of one species each, and will gain training
in population and landscape genomics, bioinformatics,
population modeling and arctic ecology.

MSc or PhD position in social-evolutionary genetics at
Simon Fraser University
A graduate student position is available for study of the
roles of intragenomic conict in human cognition and
behavior. Research will focus on the genetics and epige-
netics of human brain-expressed genomically-imprinted
genes, to ascertain their roles in mediating variation in
human psychological phenotypes.
Imprinted genes are expressed from either the copy from
the mother, or the copy from the father, in every individ-
ual. These genes are subject to within-genome conict
between the mother's and father's copies, which inu-
ences brain development, psychological and psychiatric
variation, and behavior. However, the roles of brain-
expressed imprinted genes in normal human populations
are virtually unstudied.

StAndrews SocialEvolutionTheory
== Theory of Social Evolution: Adaptation of Genes,
Individuals & Societies Natural selection explains the
appearance of design in the living world. But at what
level is this design expected to manifest - gene, individ-
ual, society - and what is its function? Social evolution
provides a window on this problem, by pitting the in-
terests of genes, individuals and societies against each
other.
I invite applications for a PhD studentship in my re-
search group at the School of Biology, University of St
Andrews, UK. I'm looking for a biology graduate who
has a strong interest in social evolution theory, or an eco-
nomics / mathematics / philosophy / physics graduate
with a strong interest in social behaviour.
Current research in my lab involves development of
general theory - using kin selection, multilevel selec-
tion, game theory and theoretical population genetics
approaches - and application of mathematical and sim-
ulation models that are tailored to the biology of real
organisms, from microbes to insects to humans (seeNovember 1, 2016 EvolDir 31
http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/gardner/ for more de-
tails). To this end, I strongly encourage interactions
within the wider grouping of theoretical and empirical
biologists in St Andrews, as well as with collaborators
further aeld.
If social evolution really fascinates you, and you are
a careful thinker, then you will ourish in the type of
project that I enjoy supervising. Theoretical projects
suit people of either sex, from any background, regard-
less of physical abilities.

ButteryClimateAdaptation
Applications are invited for a PhD studentship eligible
for NERC funding at the University of Bristol, UK
(1) Can adaptation prevent extinction due to cli-
mate change? Testing for evolutionary rescue
at contracting margins of European butteries
http://nercgw4plus.ac.uk/project/can-adaptation-
prevent-extinction-due-to-climate-change-testing-for-
evolutionary-change-at-contracting-range-margins-of-
european-butteries/ (Supervisors; Dr Jon Bridle,
University of Bristol, Dr Rob Wilson, University of
Exeter)
We are looking for a highly-motivated student to test
the ecological eects of climate change on buttery com-
munities, and the role of evolution in increasing their
resilience. Profound eects on ecosystem function are
predicted as climate change generates rapid shifts in
the geographical distributions of species. Many organ-
isms have already contracted their ranges at equatorial
margins to higher altitudes, and expanded their ranges
as their poleward margins become increasingly habit-
able. However, these responses seem limited by rates of
evolution.
Although many generalist species have shifted their
ranges to track climate change, most specialist species
remain trapped in increasingly fragmented habitats, ap-
parently because they cannot adapt to local conditions
at their ecological margins. Dening critical levels ofenvironmental change therefore depends on understand-
ing how easily (and how quickly) evolutionary rescue
can occur at ecological margins.
This project will explore evolution in European butter-
ies at their southern (contacting) margins in compari-
son to patterns observed at their northern (expanding)
margins, and will link closely with a NERC Highlight
Topic Project to explore this issue in UK butteries.
Adaptive divergence may be easier at contracting mar-
gins because population sizes are initially high, making
genetic variation locally available. By contrast, at ex-
panding margins evolution may require the spread of
novel mutations from distant populations, or may cause
the rapid loss of adaptive variation.
You will: (i) conduct buttery and host plant surveys in
central Spain, and comparing their thermal niches to our
previous data; (ii) Use population genomics to test for
local adaptation at contracting range margins in com-
parison to those involved in poleward expansions; (iii)
conduct eld transplant experiments to test for adaptive
divergence in maternal behaviour and larval survival and
and by testing larval growth rate at dierent altitudes.
You will be based at the University of Bristol, with
periods at the University of Exeter, and two eld sea-
sons in Madrid. You will receive expert training in
population ecology and genomics, spatial ecology, and
the application of evolutionary theory to conservation
policy.
Please see:http://nercgw4plus.ac.uk/phd-projects/2017-

cation procedure.
This studentship will be competitively awarded, fully

2017-projects/ Host institution: University of Bristol
CASE Partner: The Royal Zoological Society of Scot-
land, Edinburgh Project description
The wildcat (Felis silvestris) is the UK's most en-
dangered carnivore and it is fully protected, being
listed on Schedule 2 under the Conservation (Natu-
ral Habitat, &c.) Regulations,1994 and later amend-
ments. It is currently subject to the Scottish Wild-
cat Conservation Action Plan (SWCAP) involving 23
agencies that seeks to halt the species decline http://-
www.scottishwildcataction.org. A major threat to wild-
cats in Scotland is hybridisation with domestic cat[1].
The Romans are believed to have introduced the do-
mestic cat throughout Europe, around 2,000 years ago
(although there is evidence for domestic cats in Britain
since the Iron Age), providing the raw material for intro-
gressive hybridisation throughout much of the wildcat's
range. It is generally believed that the rate of introgres-
sion has substantially increased in the last century as
wildcat have dwindled into ever smaller and fragmented
populations. This project will use a combination of
whole- genome data and ddRAD data generated by the
Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Wild-
Genes laboratory from wildcats, feral and domestic cats
from across Scotland and the RZSS-led conservation
breeding programme for wildcats. The purpose of the
studentship will be to:
a) Model wildcat hybridisation dynamics in the past:
Using and adapting current HAPMIX methodologies to
infer local ancestry in the genome and determine the
history of introgression between wildcats and domes-
tic cats. In particular, we will focus on ascertaining
the timescale and mode of introgression, and testing
the hypothesis that no signicant introgression fromdomestic cats occurred prior to the last 200 years. We
envisage that current HAPMIX-based methods can be
used straightforwardly on whole genome data, and a
related methodology for RAD sequences, RADpainter
[2], will be used for the ddRAD data.
b) Model the management of wildcat hybridisation:
Combining pedigree and genomic data for the UK con-
servation breeding programme for wildcats to model
the potential for managing the populations to eliminate
domestic cat tracts within the wildcat genome [3]. In
addition, using the large amount of wildcat/hybrid mate-
rial available at the National Museums Scotland (NMS)
and through the conservation breeding programme,
the student will investigate the predictive eciency of
morphology-based determination of introgression lev-
els. Recent work [4] on Przewalski's horse provides an
exemplar for genomic approaches to conservation and
management.
c) Model wildcat hybridisation into the future: Integrat-
ing knowledge of how hybridisation has proceeded in the
past to understand the future options for management
of wildcat reintroductions in the face of gene ow from
domestics. The student will build a predictive model
for the wildcat, based on the SLiM2 genome modelling
package, which will allow researchers to investigate the
consequences of a number of scenarios.

UEastAnglia EvolutionSenescence
Biomarkers of senescence in the Seychelles warbler
That individuals dier greatly in when, and how quickly,
they senesce is clear - why they dier is not. Understand-
ing what causes variation in senescence and, therefore,
how this can be mitigated is of medical, veterinary and
societal importance. Unfortunately, in most vertebrate
animals measuring within-individual senescence, and
what factors experienced over a lifetime impact it, is
extremely dicult.
The student will use the Seychelles warbler system to
test the eciency of a range of traits that have been
suggested to reect an individual's intrinsic condition
and measure, or predict, within-individual senescence.
The ability of these 'biomarkers' to determine which
environmental factors have most impact on patterns
of senescence will then be tested. Previous work in
this species has shown that senescence occurs, and that
telomere dynamics do, to some extent, reect biologi-
cal ageing. However various other potential biomarkers
have yet to be tested.
The student will receive excellent general training from
the thriving Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Part-
nership and also gain an extensive range of technical
skills including molecular techniques, next generation
sequencing, animal handling and eld skills, database
manipulation, and statistical analysis. There will be
an important eldwork component on Cousin Island

Genomic signatures of adaptation in an island bird -
CASE studentship with IPNA-CSIC (Tenerife)
Interested applicants are ancouraged to contact the main
supervisor, Dr Lewis Spurgin: l.spurgin@uea.ac.uk
Aim
To use cutting edge genomic tools in combination with
ecological eldwork to enhance understanding of evolu-
tionary adaptation in wild animals.
Background
Genomic tools are revolutionizing our understanding of
Darwinian natural selection. Using genomic data, it is
now possible to not only identify the genes under natu-
ral selection, but also their function and the ecological
factors that drive selection.
Some of the best examples of natural selection come
from island bird species. Moreover, many island birds
are becoming endangered due to habitat degradation
and climate change, so understanding their ecology andevolution is of paramount conservation concern.
Methods
The student will carry out population sampling, eco-
logical surveying and analysis of genomic data from 13
Island populations of Berthelot's pipit. Our previous
work has shown that these populations dier markedly
in their ecology (particularly in parasites and altitude),
and that natural selection and \chance" interact to
shape patterns of genetic variation. We have recently
generated sequence data from ~300 key functional genes
and~2000 non-coding regions (using sequence capture
and RAD-seq, respectively) from the populations. The
student will use this data to identify:
Which genes are under natural selection among island
populations? What are the biological processes under
natural selection? How do parasites and altitude drive
natural selection? Research Environment and Training
This project will be supervised by Dr Lewis Spurgin
and Prof David Richardson at the University of East
Anglia, and Dr Brent Emerson at IPNA-CSIC. The stu-
dent will form part of an inclusive and dynamic research
community at UEA. IPNA-CSIC is a successful research
institute in Tenerife and a case partner to the project.
The student will spend at least 3 months at IPNA-CSIC,
directly interacting with Canarian researchers.
The student will receive training in ecological eldwork,
molecular genetics, bioinformatics and advanced data
analysis. They will also receive wide-ranging training
from NERC and UEA to increase scientic skills and
enhance employability.
Person specication
1.Degree in biology, zoology or related subject 2.Field
work and analytical skills desired (but training will be
given) 3.Willingness to learn programming languages
Funding
This project has been shortlisted for funding by the En-
vEast NERC Doctoral Training Partnership, comprising
the Universities of East Anglia, Essex and Kent, with
twenty other research partners.
Shortlisted applicants will be interviewed on 14/15
February 2017.
Successful candidates who meet RCUK's eligibility crite-
ria will be awarded a NERC studentship. In most cases,
UK and EU nationals who have been resident in the
UK for 3 years are eligible for a full award. In 2016/17,
the stipend was £14,296.

SawyEvolutionaryHistory 2
Early Stage Researcher (PhD student) position in Eco-
logical genomics of rapid radiations in plant-feeding
insects
University of Eastern Finland, Department of Environ-
mental and Biological Sciences (Joensuu campus)
JOB DESCRIPTION
We are looking for a highly motivated person to perform
research on the biotic and abiotic drivers of diversica-
tion in young but species-rich groups of sawies (order
Hymenoptera). In many of these plant-feeding groups,
speciation may be facilitated by specialization into us-
ing alternative host plants or other feeding niches, or
by simple geographic isolation. In general terms, the
project aims at explaining the origin of niche and species
diversity in species-rich and widely distributed resource-
consumer communities.
The focus will be on ecologically diverse sawy groups
containing numerous closely-related species that can-
not be separated using standard morphological and
population-genetic methods. New population-genomic
approaches based on genotyping by next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) provide a means for studying the species
status of closely-related lineages feeding on dierent host
plants or inhabiting dierent geographic regions, and to
estimate the level of gene ow across species boundaries.
The work will be performed mainly in the Joensuu
Molecular Ecology Group (www.jmeg.), which is led
by Associate Professor Tommi Nyman, and operates at
the Department of Environmental and Biological Sci-
ences of the University of Eastern Finland (www.uef./-
en/envbio). In addition to Tommi Nyman, the work
will be supervised by Senior Curator Marko Mutanen
(University of Oulu, Finland; www.researchgate.net/-
prole/Marko Mutanen) and Curator Stefan Schmidt
(Zoologische Staatssammlung Munchen, Germany;
www.zsm.mwn.de/hym/e/stefanschmidt.htm). Part of
the laboratory work will be done during extended visitsto the laboratories of the external co-supervisors. The
project, which is funded by the Academy of Finland, also
includes extensive collaboration with an international
network of experts on sawy taxonomy, biogeography,
and ecology.
REQUIREMENTS
During the project, the PhD student will tackle cen-
tral eco-evolutionary questions based on research on
several taxonomically complex but evolutionarily highly
interesting sawy groups. Analyses will be based on
specimen-level genotypic data obtained using reduced-
representation NGS methods (including ddRADseq).
The work requires very diverse skills, including eld sam-
pling, laboratory work, use of bioinformatic pipelines,
population-genetic analyses, and writing research pa-
pers. Many of these skills will be learned during the
project, but applicants should have a strong background
in population genetics or related elds.
The PhD student positions may be applied for by per-
sons who according to the Universities Act of Finland
(558/2009, Chapter 5, Section 37) are eligible for stud-
ies leading to a scientic postgraduate degree. Persons
graduating in the near future are also encouraged to
apply. However, they are expected to hold a relevant
MSc degree (or equivalent) by the starting date of the
Early Stage Researcher position.
BENEFITS
The position will rst be lled for 24 months, with a
possibility for prolongation for six months. The contin-
uation of the position will be agreed separately. The
current funding covers the rst 2.5 years of the PhD
project, but the chances of obtaining further funding
should be good if things proceed as planned. The start
date of the position is 1 January 2017 or as agreed.
Positions of early stage researchers shall always be lled
for a xed term (UEF Administrative Regulations, Sec-
tion 30). A probationary period is applied to all new
members of the sta.
The salary of the position is determined in accordance
with the salary system of Finnish universities and is
based on levels 2-4 of the job requirement level chart
for teaching and research sta (euro 1,986 - 2,475 /
month). In addition to the job requirement component,
the salary includes a personal performance component,
which may be a maximum of 46.3% of the job require-
ment component. In practice, the salary will be circa
euro 2,320 / month at the start of the project.

Background Life is almost ubiquitous on Earth: or-
ganisms live wherever there is liquid water. However,
whether all types of microorganisms can be found every-
where is a longstanding debate, with important implica-
tions for the health of humans and their environment.
Microbes must be put on the map! Measuring the ca-
pacity to grow in extreme conditions is an excellent
way to test for the diversity of types found in natural
environments.
Research goal Determine the abundance of ex-
tremophiles in benign environments. Compare the phys-
iological breadth of organisms found in these benign
environments to organisms isolated from extreme envi-
ronments.
Research methodology The student will conduct eld
sampling at selected marine and freshwater sites across
the UK and at two sites hosting a diversity of extremes
(the salt deposits of Boulby Underground Laboratory,
UK, including MgCl2-rich brines, and acidic volcanic
habitats in Iceland). Serial dilutions of samples from
these sites will be cultured in a wide range of extreme
conditions (pH, salinity, MgCl2, etc.) in the lab tomeasure the abundance of extremophiles in these sites.
Isolated extremophiles will be characterized using both
traditional microbiological techniques and state-of-the-
art DNA sequencing approaches. The global applica-
bility of ndings from the eld and the lab will be
investigated using computational approaches to query
growing databases of DNA-sequences that have world-
wide coverage.
Training In addition to training as part of EnvEast
and the University of Essex graduate training program,
which includes training in statistical analysis and sci-
ence communication, the student will receive training in:
eld sampling approaches, innovative microbial cultur-
ing techniques, high-throughput robotic liquid handling
and culture characterization, molecular techniques for
the analysis of DNA sequences and bioinformatics.
Person specication We seek a highly motivated in-
dividual who is enthusiastic about problem solving.
The student will have a degree in biology, in a
branch of environmental science or in engineering.
The student will be enrolled in the PhD program of
the School of Biological Sciences of the University
of Essex (http://www2.essex.ac.uk/academic/oces/-
graduate/) and will benet from professional develop-
ment through Procio (http://www.essex.ac.uk/study/-
pgr/procio/default.aspx).
Experience with microbial cultures or sequence analysis
would be an asset, as would a valid UK/EU driver's
license.
Funding Successful candidates who meet RCUK's eli-
gibility criteria will be awarded a NERC studentship.
In most cases, UK and EU nationals who have been
resident in the UK for 3 years are eligible for a full
award. In 2016/17, the stipend was 14,296.
Shortlisted applicants will be invited to an interview
day on the 17th or 18th February 2016.

UExeter BeesPathogenEvolution
Bees, bugs and antibiotics - the interactions of agricul-
tural and veterinary antibiotics with bee health
The pollination services provided by bumblebees and
honeybees are crucial for agricultural sustainability. In42 EvolDir November 1, 2016
recent years, it has become clear that the gut micro-
biome plays a crucial role in bee health. In fact, the
resistance against Critihidia bombi, a key parasite of
bumblebees, and the strong genotype-genotype inter-
actions with its host are predominantly explained by
the gut biome rather than by the host itself (Koch et al
Ecology Letters 2012, Wilfert et al. Molecular Ecology
2007). Antibiotics can disrupt this interaction and cause
tness loss (Koch et al. PNAS 2011). Environmental
exposure to antibiotics is a potentially serious problem
in bees: antibiotic sprays are used while crops are in
ower and prophylactic antibiotic treatment of honey-
bees is widespread in North America, which has led
to the evolution of AMR. Studying the interactions of
pollinators, pathogens and antibiotics is thus crucial for
a sustainable future.
In this PhD, you will be able to study fundamental
evolutionary ecology, for example testing the eect of
stress on community stability, while directly address-
ing questions around pollinator health. You will receive
training in experimental ecology and microbiology, bioin-
formatics and mathematical modelling. The project
will be supervised by Dr. Lena Wilfert, Prof. Will
Gaze, Dr. TJ McKinley and Prof. Angus Buckling
at the University of Exeter and Prof. Ed Feil at the
University of Bath. You will join an interdisciplinary
group working on topics the evolutionary ecology of
biotic interactions, with world-leading experts in mi-
crobial ecology and evolution, pollination ecology and
epidemiology at the Penryn Campus of the University
of Exeter. To nd out more about our research, visit

Project description
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED RESEARCH Virus
host shifts where a virus jumps from one host species
to another are a major source of emerging infectious
diseases. For example, Ebola, HIV and SARS coron-
avirus have all jumped into humans from other species.
Despite the importance of emerging viral diseases, we
have a limited understanding about what determines
the ability of a virus to infect some groups of hosts but
not others, or how viruses will evolve in dierent hosts
(Longdon et al. 2014). Understanding these processes
is vital to predict when and where diseases will emerge
in the future.
BACKGROUND Viruses are disproportionally respon-
sible for emerging infectious diseases, with RNA viruses
that normally infect multiple host species considered
the most likely to emerge. Additionally, host shifts ap-
pear to occur most often between closely related host
species. However, evidence for these hypotheses largely
come from correlational data (i.e. observations with
no experimental manipulation). Therefore, they point
us toward interesting areas for investigation, but can-
not tease apart the complex processes explaining the
observed patterns.
Experimental studies have highlighted some of the im-
portant host-virus interactions that result in successful
host shifts (e.g. parvoviruses from cats to dogs (Par-
rish et al. 2008) but the majority of these studies have
been limited to two host in vitro systems, i.e. using cell
cultures. Host-virus interactions may dier in whole
animals for many reasons, and using only two hosts
prevents drawing general conclusions. Therefore, experi-
mental studies using a wide breadth of host species that
vary in their relatedness are essential to make broadly
applicable conclusions. Work in our lab uses up to
50 species of Drosophila, and their naturally occurring
RNA viruses (Longdon et al. 2011, 2015) to examine
host shifts (video here www.goo.gl/sXBiv5 showing pat-November 1, 2016 EvolDir 43
terns of susceptibility across hosts). These ies have
equivalent diversity to all mammals and are an estab-
lished innate-immunity model. By using a large number
of dierent host species we will be able to nd general
patterns that apply across hosts species with varying
relatedness.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project will explore
how dierent environmental, ecological and evolutionary
factors may limit the ability of a virus to infect dierent
hosts. The project may be taken in several directions
based on the interests of the candidate, including:
Examining how viral coinfection can eect the outcome
of infection across dierent host species
Testing the relative importance and interplay of en-
vironmental and genetic factors in determining host
susceptibility
Testing whether viruses with varying degrees of related-
ness have similar abilities to infect dierent host species
Testing whether dierent routes of infection alter the
likelihood of a successful host shift

Hi everyone,
I anticipate accepting several PhD students interested in
studying either host-parasite co-evolution or Caribbean
bat evolution at the University of Florida starting Fall
2017.
1) Are you interested in interdisciplinary research in
host-parasite evolution? Our lab uses host-specic par-
asites to study primate and human evolution. We use
molecular data from parasitic lice to make inferences
about human evolution. We have used lice to esti-
mate when humans began wearing clothing, when we
left Africa, whether we had close contact with Nean-
derthals and much more. This research has garnered a
lot of media coverage over the years and there are many
more interesting questions to ask. We have a pending
NSF proposal now on this work. Skills needed for this
work will include exceedingly good organizational skills,
molecular lab techniques, whole-genome sequencing, and
bioinformatics.
2) Are you interested in studying bats on Caribbean is-
lands? Our lab is studying the aects of climate change
on bat species. This interdisciplinary work uses molecu-
lar data, fossil data, and ecological niche modeling to
better understand the factors that shape evolution on
islands. The research involves eldwork, labwork, and
at times computer simulation. Student would need next-
gen sequencing and bioinformatics skills to be successful
in this area of research.
More information on the lab and our research can be
found at www.mnh.u.edu/mammals/ Applicants
should be highly motivated, able to work both indepen-
dently and in collaborative groups, and have previous
biological research experience. My research group is
highly collaborative and we place a premium on colle-
giality. My lab is in the Florida Museum of Natural
History, which provides many benets in addition to the
academic departments where my students matriculate.
The University of Florida has a strong community of evo-
lutionary biologists (http://evolution.group.u.edu/).
Prospective students should apply through the Biology
Program (http://biology.u.edu/). Potential funding
sources include University fellowships, research assis-
tantships, and teaching assistantships.
Interested prospective students should rst contact Dr.44 EvolDir November 1, 2016
David L. Reed (dreed@u.edu) as soon as possible. Bi-
ology Dept. application deadlines are early (Dec 1)!
Include with your email the following: 1) a short state-
ment about your research interests, 2) a brief overview
of your previous research experiences, and 3) CV or
resume.
Information about Gainesville, Florida: Situated in the
rolling countryside of north central Florida, Gainesville
is much more than a stereotypical college town. Home
of the University of Florida, seat of Alachua County's
government and the region's commercial hub, it is pro-
gressive, environmentally conscious and culturally di-
verse. The presence of many students and faculty from
abroad among its 99,000-plus population adds a strong
cross-cultural avor to its historic small-town Southern
roots. Its natural environment, temperate climate and
civic amenities make Gainesville a beautiful, pleasant
and interesting place in which to learn and to live.
Time and time again, Gainesville has been tapped as
one of Florida's most livable cities and ranked among
the leaders in the United States. Agreeable weather and
lovely landscapes, attractive educational and economic
opportunities, varied cultural and recreational resources,
and a youthful, energetic ambiance all contribute to the
standard of living enjoyed by area residents. Natural
springs abound in the Gainesville area, and we are only
70 miles from the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast of
FL.

UMarburg InvasiveLadyBeetles
A Research Assistant position (PhD student) is available
at the University of Marburg, Germany.
We are interested in a mechanistic understanding why
some species become invasive while others remain be-
nign. Non-native predators bearing a unique set of cues
might have the double advantage of na ve prey and
na ve predators and thus outcompete native predators.
In this project, we will compare the aggression of ants
towards lady beetles, the avoidance behavior of aphids,
and the consumption of aphids by lady beetles currently
occurring in Europe and in North America. In addi-
tion, we will analyze lady beetle cues to quantify cue
similarity between native and non-native species. The
combination of behavioral experiments with chemical
analyses will not only shed light on the semiochemicals
that mediate these interactions but also improve our
ability to explain and predict high-impact invasions of
insect predators.
The successful applicant will hold an MSc-degree (with
very good results) or equivalent in Ecology and Evo-
lution or a related relevant discipline and will have
practical experience in eld work and laboratory ex-
periments. Expertise in entomology (preferably with
aphid antagonists), experimental design and chemical
ecology would be benecial. Candidates need to have
a high intrinsic motivation, a critical mindset and the
ability to work in a structured and independent man-
ner. Further requirements include good communication
skills, the willingness to carry out eld and lab work in
the USA for several months and to guide assistants and
students, excellent English oral and writing skills and
driving license category B.

Wolbachia
The Cooper lab at the University of Montana in Missoula
(http://www.cooper-lab.org/) is recruiting 1-2 Ph.D.
students to start in the fall of 2017. Our lab is focused
on understanding dierentiation within and divergence
among Wolbachia-infected Drosophila y host species.
Maternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria infect the
cells of most insects on the planet, and Wolbachia from
Drosophila have been leveraged for biocontrol of disease
(particularly dengue and now Zika). These Wolbachia
block viruses in their natural hosts and in transinfected
Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes (www.eliminatedengue.com).
Despite all of this interesting biology, we have a limited
understanding about how Wolbachia generally aect
host physiology and tness to facilitate their spread.
Our lab employs tools from molecular genetics, physiol-
ogy, behavior, chemistry, genomics, and eld biology to
dissect eects of Wolbachia on hosts.
Ongoing projects include: phylogenomic analysis of Wol-
bachia acquisition, genetic analysis of host-Wolbachia
interactions, analysis of Wolbachia abundance and lo-
calization during host development using microscopy,
and analysis of reproductive isolation between closely
related Wolbachia-infected host species. We are excited
to recruit students interested in some combination of
molecular and cell biology, physiology, genomics, and
speciation. Students will have the opportunity to get
involved in existing projects, and to develop their own.50 EvolDir November 1, 2016
We share a new open lab space with the Cheviron,
Fishman, Good, Miller, and McCutcheon labs. This
generates a vibrant microenvironment with a diverse
range of expertise available to students and postdocs.
Missoula, MT is vibrant college town with many outdoor

UNeuchatel PathogenEvolGenomics
PhD student positions in Evolutionary Genomics of
Pathogens at the University of Neuch^ atel, Switzerland
The Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics is searching
highly motivated PhD students to work on the evolu-
tionary genomics of fungal plant pathogens. Pathogens
in agricultural ecosystems pose serious threats to global
food security. At the same time, pathogens oer also
many of the most fascinating and well-studied examples
of adaptive evolution because evolutionary change is
observable within very short time scales.
Our lab investigates the molecular basis of adaptation in
fungal pathogens, the evolution of virulence in pathogen
populations and mechanisms of genome evolution facili-
tating rapid adaptation. Our main model is a fungus
(Zymoseptoria tritici) that causes a widespread disease
on wheat. In our research, we work with natural eld
populations, use a variety of experimental approaches
in the laboratory, greenhouse and the eld, perform
whole-genome population sequencing and assemblies
of complete genomes. We are a diverse group with
backgrounds in evolutionary biology, genomics, plant
pathology and microbiology. We put a lot of emphasis
on team work and scientic discussions. You can learn
more about our research and recent publications on ourwebsite (http://www.pathogen-genomics.org).
Available PhD projects include genome-wide association
studies to elucidate the genetic architecture of virulence
and abiotic stress tolerance. For this, we will analyze
populations from natural elds and identify gene vari-
ants that enabled the pathogen to breakdown resistance
of local wheat varieties. We will also perform large-
scale ecological genomics studies to identify the mecha-
nisms and trade-os governing host adaptation in the
eld. Finally, we will investigate the mechanisms driving
rapid chromosomal evolution by analyzing completely
assembled pathogen genomes. The PhD projects are in
collaboration with research groups at the University of
Neuch^ atel, the ETH Zurich and the Agroscope.
The Institute of Biology (http://unine.ch/biol/page-
7860 en.html) oers a highly dynamic and diverse re-
search environment and is located at the beautiful Lake
Neuch^ atel with views of the Swiss Alps. The city of
Neuch^ atel is centrally located in Switzerland and most
other cities can be reached within 0.5 - 2 h. The working
language in the group is English.
Candidates must hold a MSc degree in biology and have
a strong interest in combining evolutionary biology and
genomics. Experience in programming and/or statistical
analyses (e.g. in R) is not required but is a plus. We
expect group members to have strong social skills and
actively engage in collaborations. Positions are available
from January 2017 but later dates are also possible. Ap-
plications will be reviewed starting 10 November 2016
but the positions remain open until lled.
Applicants should send documents (as a single pdf) in-
cluding: A cover letter stating their research interests
and motivation to apply. A complete curriculum vitae.
A reference letter of at least one referee.
Any inquiries about the positions and full ap-
plications should be sent to: Daniel Croll

(https://research.unsw.edu.au/unsw-scientia-phd-
scholarship-scheme). We have been lucky enough to
have been awarded one of these.
The topic is broad intentionally to attract a very good
students: Climate change is impacting ecosystems world-
wide. Many plant and animal species will not survive
unless their distributions shift. However, not all species
are moving and we don't systematically understand why.This is a key challenge for understanding climate impact.
In this project students will tackle important knowledge
gaps: Can we use functional traits to predict species'
ability to shift distributions? Which biotic and abiotic
factors are important in determining species range? Do
dierent processes act at northern vs southern limits?
And, are distributions shaped by extreme climate events,
or by the average conditions at a site?
This project comes with $40,000 per year stipend and
$10,000 of research funding per year. It is open to both
Australian and international applicants. The expected
start date of the PhD is August 2017.

Evolutionof the New Zealand bird fauna
APhD position in evolutionary genomics is available to
study aspects of the evolution of New Zealand's unique
bird fauna with Dr Michael Knapp at the University of
Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.
NewZealand's isolation and mammal predator free envi-
ronment has lead to the evolution of a unique bird fauna.
It includes model species to study the evolution of is-
land gigantism, ightlessness and alpine adaptations,
to name just a few, and is therefore uniquely suited to
shed light on the ecological and molecular processes that
underlie such evolutionary adaptations.
ThisPhD project is part of our Royal Society funded
research programme, which uses genomic data to ad-dress key questions of bird evolution and conservation
in New Zealand's unique environment. It oers the ex-
ibility for the PhD student to decide on the direction of
the PhD studies within the framework of our research
programme. Possible question include for example the
response of the New Zealand bird fauna to past and
predicted future climate change, and the evolutionary
basis of island gigantism and ightlessness.
Theideal PhD student will have skills in molecular
ecology/population genetics and/or bioinformatics and
genome data analyses.
The University of Otago is one of the most research-
intensive Universities in New Zealand with a world-class
reputation in the life sciences. It provides an envi-
ronment that allows its students to undertake interna-
tionally recognised research, in a diverse and vibrant

PhD position in genomics of microbial eukaryote para-
sites
See full description and how to apply here: http://-
www.uu.se/en/about-uu/join-us/details/?positionId=-
3D112797 Microbial eukaryote parasites are very
diverse and widespread across the eukaryotic tree
of life, but our understanding of these important
organisms is mostly based on a relatively small number
of species in pathogenous groups (such as Apicomplexa
or Microsporidia). Other groups, composed partly or
exclusively of parasites, have thus far eluded in depth
investigation. Ascetosporea is one such group of poorly
characterized parasites belonging to Rhizaria, itself
the least studied of the major divisions of eukaryotes.
The lineage diversity and host range of ascetosporean
parasites have been recently found to be much larger
than anticipated, among which are important pathogens
of molluscs costing millions of dollars to the aquaculture
industry. In spite of this, our genomic understanding of
the evolution of Ascetosporea is extremely limited, and
no genomes are currently available.
This project aims to de novo sequence, assemble, andannotate several genomes of Ascetosporea and related
organisms. Material will be provided by collaborators
(mainly in the UK) and sequence in-house. This newly
generated data will then be used to establish an evolu-
tionary framework for Ascetosporea using a combination
of phylogenetics and genomic analyses. Based on the
outcome of this rst part, we will broadly look at the
evolution of parasitism in Ascetosporea, i.e. identify
pre-parasitic conditions, ancestral parasitic innovations,
and lineage-specic adaptations using comparative ge-
nomics. This project will shed light on a large group of
parasites for which we lack even the most fundamental
knowledge about their biology. As part of a more gen-
eral aim to sequence uncultured micro-eukaryotes, the
student will also be involved in developing single-cell
genome sequencing approaches.
The PhD student will work under the supervision
of Dr Fabien Burki (http://www.iob.uu.se/research/-
systematic-biology/burki-lab/), in the Systematic Biol-
ogy Program at the Evolutionary Biology Centre (EBC),
Uppsala University. EBC constitutes an exciting arena
for multidisciplinary research in evolutionary biology in
a broad sense, housing some 300 scientists and graduate
students. The scientic environment with numerous
seminars, journal clubs and social activities oer excel-
lent possibilities for contacts and collaborations. Local
platforms for high-performance computational analyses
(https://www.uppmax.uu.se/uppnex), and sequencing
(http://www.scilifelab.se) ensure immediate access to
state-of-the-art technology.
Qualications: To be eligible for a PhD-student posi-
tion the applicant must hold a master degree in Biology
or equivalent. Extensive experience in bioinformatics,
genome analysis, and phylogenetics are a must. Ex-
perience working in the lab is also required. Acquain-
tance with the fascinating world of microbial eukaryotes
(protists) will be considered a strong merit. The ideal
candidate is highly motivated and can work both in-
dependently and as part of a team. High standard of
spoken and written English is required.

PhD at St Andrews, UK. Genomics & Gene ow in ies
A PhD is available for a student interested in genomics
and speciation, for a project at St Andrews, Scotland,
supervised by Mike Ritchie, Oscar Gaggiotti & Konrad
Lohse (Edinburgh).
The student will play a leading role in the analysis of
newly obtained genomes of species of the virilis group of
Drosophila. The main aims will be to identify candidate
genes for evidence of positive selection along particular
lineages. Also, analyses of the distribution of diver-
gence between species and levels of nucleotide diversity
within regions will identify if there are consistent ge-
nomic areas of divergence and if chromosomal features
inuence the distribution of such regions. For example,
inverted regions of chromosomes may show reduced gene
ow between species. The samples are from areas of
allopatry and sympatry and contrasted patterns of diver-
gence across the genome can reveal potential examples
of introgression. Co-supervisor1, Konrad Lohse, has de-
veloped new methods to detect introgression and regions
of admixture from such genomic data. Co-supervisor
2, Oscar Gaggiotti, has developed methods to detect
genomic outliers while controlling for population history
and ecological covariates. Both will advise and help the
student apply such techniques to the data. The lead su-
pervisor, Michael Ritchie, brings extensive experience of
speciation in this group. The Ritchie laboratory is also
working on methods of gene disruption and introgres-
sion, so there is exciting potential to follow-on genomic
comparisons with targeted manipulation of candidate
genes.

UTasmania EucalyptusEvolution
PhD Opportunity (University of Tasmania, Hobart):
Evolutionary dynamics in a globally signicant Euca-
lyptus lineage
An exciting opportunity exists for a highly motivated
student to join biologists and mathematicians at UTAS
to tease apart the dierent processes that contribute to
the complex evolutionary dynamics of Australia's iconic
eucalypts.
Our recent research into the phylogenetic relationships
among eucalypts, using genome-wide markers and mul-
tiple geographically widespread samples, has revealed
numerous puzzling discrepancies, most likely due to
recent radiation, incomplete lineage sorting of given ge-
nomic markers, and/or reticulate (non-tree-like) evolu-
tion. However, these evolutionary processes are dicult
to distinguish, and the relative contribution of each is
likely to vary across the continent and among groups
of species. This project will exploit this new molecular
phylogeny of eucalypts to tease apart these evolution-
ary processes and reconstruct the relative timing of the
evolution of key traits.
The project will be embedded in the Eucalypt Genet-
ics Group at UTAS (www.eucalyptgenetics.com, led
by Profs Brad Potts and Ren e Vaillancourt) which
has a world-class interdisciplinary research programme
that investigates the evolutionary and ecological forces
that shape diversity in Eucalyptus. It involves cross-
disciplinary collaboration with mathematicians in the
Theoretical Phylogenetics Group at UTAS (including
A/Profs Barbara Holland and Mike Charleston) which
has a special interest in applying mathematics and statis-tics to problems in evolutionary biology and ecology.
The project is based in Hobart which oers an excel-
lent lifestyle with stunning wilderness areas nearby, a
vibrant arts and boutique food culture and aordable
living expenses compared with other Australian capital
cities.
To apply, please email a brief summary of research in-
terests along with a CV and the contact details for at
least two referees. Applications will be assessed on an
ongoing basis. Students with an excellent academic
background and enthusiasm will be invited to apply to
UTAS for a competitive scholarship (open until 16 Octo-
ber 2016; applications after this date can be considered
in future rounds if the project is unlled). International
students are eligible for these scholarships, but may also
apply through another program (e.g. Endeavour, or
a scheme in the applicant's home country). To rank
highly in these scholarship rounds, students will need to
have completed a Masters by Research (or international
equivalent) or rst class Honours (domestic students),
and have at least one publication. Running costs will
be funded by a recently awarded ARC Discovery Grant.

UTokyo EcoEvolutionaryDynamics
The Sheerson lab at the University of Tokyo is re-
cruiting graduate students at both the MS and PhD
levels. We specialize in eco-evolutionary dynamics and
plant/microbial evolution, and are currently working on
the following funded research projects:56 EvolDir November 1, 2016
1) Micro-evolutionary interactions between symbiosis
and population dynamics, with a focus on the mycor-
rhiza.
2) The micro- and macro-evolution of senescence-related
life history patterns and life history costs, with a focus
on herbaceous plants and terrestrial fungi.
3) Interactions between community structure and phy-
logeny at diering timescales, with a focus on the myc-
orrhiza.
4) Eco-evolutionary impacts of conservation problems
and associated management.
Students applying to work in the lab may focus on these
topics, or choose other research themes in plant and
microbial evolutionary ecology. Research methods typ-
ically involve in situ monitoring and experimentation,
combined with modeling and analysis based in R and/or
C++. The Sheerson lab is global in its scope, with ac-
tive eld sites in the USA, Europe, and Central America.
Our current collaborations include projects in Estonia,
China, Taiwan, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the

ESR5: \EFFICIENT CAPTURING AND THIRD-
GENERATION SEQUENCING OF COMPLEX GE-
NOMIC REGIONS"
Ph.D. position for 36 months in the group of Prof.
Elena Conti, Department of Systematic and Evolution-
ary Botany, University of Zurich, Switzerland
Summary: Sequencing of complex genomic regions can
be achieved by direct sequencing of long single molecules
via third-generation sequencing. Targeted sequencing of
long DNA stretches of interest is challenging. Current
capturing methods are inecient and too expensive to
be used in every-day research. Nevertheless, multiple
biological traits of both fundamental and commercial
interest are determined by complex genomic regions (su-
pergenes), whose functional analysis is hindered because
their genomic sequence remains unknown. We aim to
establish a protocol allowing us to specically capture
very long DNA stretches that could be directly funneled
into commercially available thirdgeneration sequencers
(Pacic Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore). We will
use this methodology to reveal the full sequence of the
S-locus in Primula veris and to study its evolution and
molecular genetics in a wide range of primrose species.
Job Description: One of the key goals of this project
is to develop a new methodology for capturing and se-
quencing complex genomic regions in a targeted way.
Therefore, this position involves molecular laboratory
work to develop and optimize capturing and sequencing
protocols; bioinformatics work to analyse and interpret
next-generation sequencing data; and evolutionary and
functional genetic analyses of the S-locus (heterostyly
supergene) in primroses. Building on published work
by Elena Conti and Michael Lenhard, the project uses
state-of-the-art third generation sequencing technology
to generate long sequencing reads, coupled with custom
made bioinformatics pipelines to assemble and anno-
tate these sequences. Recent development by Oxford
Nanopore technology in combination with the method-
ology we will develop in this project may be used for58 EvolDir November 1, 2016
future in-eld screening applications. This project is
aimed at addressing one of the fundamental questions
of evolutionary biology, namely, the genetic makeup of
the S-locus in primroses, via developing a new cutting-
edge method for thirdgeneration sequencing. This PhD
position oers a unique opportunity to combine the expe-
rience of working for a market-leading private company
that provides solutions for life sciences (BaseClear VB)
with an academic research environment at the University
of Zurich, oering world leading expertise in evolution-
ary biology research and cutting-edge improvements of
technological advances in genomic sequencing.
The successful candidate will pursue the doctoral degree
at the University of Zurich (Switzerland), working 18
months at said University and the other 18 months at
BaseClear BV, in the Netherlands. Prof. Elena Conti
(University of Zurich), Prof. Michael Lenhard (Univer-
sity of Potsdam), Dr. Peter Szovenyi (University of
Zurich); Dr. Walter Pirovano and Dr. Dani el Duijsings
(BaseClear BV, the Netherlands) will jointly supervise
the successful candidate. The fellowship period includes
frequent periods of trans-national mobility. The 36
months of the Ph.D. position will be under a full-time
working contract at BaseClear BV. Secondment periods
are planned with University of Potsdam, Germany, for
6 months

we.vub.ac.be/en/biology-department >, Marine Biol-
ogy Lab<http://we.vub.ac.be/en/marc-kochzius >,
Belgium.
We are searching for a highly motivated PhD student
that will work on *evolution, population genetics and
connectivity in Antarctic sea stars* utilising a *ge-
nomics* approach (DNA barcoding, microsatellites and
next generation sequencing) in the framework of the
interdisciplinary project
*Refugia and Ecosystem Tolerance in the Southern
Ocean (RECTO).*
Because of its long history and geographic isolation,
the Southern Ocean (SO) provides a natural labora-
tory for research on evolution and biodiversity. Con-
fronted with fast-paced environmental changes, biotain Antarctic ecosystems are strongly challenged and
face three possible outcomes: adaptation, migration or
extinction. Past glaciation periods have already forced
marine zoobenthos of the SO into refugia, being either
ice-free continental shelf areas, the deep sea or sub- or
peri-Antarctic regions, followed by recolonization when
the ice retreated. In a multidisciplinary approach and
involving all major Belgian research groups studying
evolution and diversity of SO faunas, RECTO will strive
at understanding how such past events have driven di-
versication and adaptation in dierent animal groups
and how these can be applied as proxies to understand
the contemporary situation and predict future scenarios.
The Marine Biology Lab at the VUB specialises in re-
search on molecular ecology of marine fauna from the
poles to the tropics and from invertebrates to shes. In
the new collaborative research project RECTO the evo-
lutionary history of Antarctic sea stars will be studied.
*Prole of the PhD student:*
Master in (marine) biology with excellent study results
Experience in genomics (lab work and bioinformatics)
Interest in the ecology and evolution of Antarctic sea
stars
Excellent oral and written English skills (for minimum
requirements see http://www.vub.ac.be/en/studying-at-
the-vub/language-requirements)
Willingness to participate in long sampling campaigns
under extreme conditions in the Southern Ocean
Obligation to nalise a doctoral thesis within 4 years
The marine biology lab oers excellent coaching in an
inspiring research environment with up-to-date research
facilities in the international and multilingual capital of
Europe.
Interested candidates are requested to submit their appli-
cation (motivation letter, two reference letters, summary

Call for Short-Term Scientic Missions (STSM)
*COST Action CA15112- Functional Annotation of An-
imal Genomes - European network (FAANG-Europe)*
*Summary*
We are looking to fund short-term scientic missions to
develop scientic collaborations between participating
institutions involved in the FAANG COST Action.
*Objective*
FAANG-Europe aims to establish a collaborative frame-
work to enable functional annotation of animal genomes
as well as to develop a shared research agenda to de-
liver improved functional annotation of animal genomes.
STSM should contribute to this aim as well as to train
research scientists and students in a) assays by sequenc-
ing, b) analysis of functional sequence data, c) use ofannotated genome sequences and functional annotation
data.
*Call deadline: 31st October 2016*
Standard STSMs need to take place according to the
following rules:
- Be a minimum duration of 5 days;
- Be a maximum duration of 90 days;
- Needs to be carried out in their entirety within a single
grant period and within the Action's lifetime.
- STSM should end before 1st April 2017;
Specic additional provisions have been adopted by the
CSO to encourage the participation of Early Career
Investigators (ECI) in STSM.
- Be a minimum duration of 91 days;
- Be a maximum duration of 180 days;
- Needs to be carried out within their entirety within a
single grant period and within the Action's lifetime.
*Financial Support*
An STSM grant is a xed nancial contribution which
takes into consideration the budget request of the ap-
plicant and the outcome of the evaluation of the STSM
application as determined by the Action Chair (or Vice
Chair if the Action Chair is aliated to the Grant Holder
Institution) and / or the STSM Coordinator / Commit-
tee. STSM Grants do not necessarily cover all expenses
related to performing a given mission. The Grant is a
contribution to the overall travel, accommodation and
meal expenses of the Grantee. The calculation of this
contribution for a STSM must be based on the following
rules:
- up to a maximum of EUR 2 500 in total can be aorded
to each successful STSM applicant;
- up to a maximum of EUR 160 per day can be aorded
for accommodation and meal expenses.
For ECIs (Early Career Investigators), the calculation
for an increased nancial contribution must respect the
following criteria:
- up to a maximum of EUR 3 500 in total can be aorded
to ECIs for missions with a duration of between 91 and
180 days;
- up to a maximum of EUR 160 per day can be aorded
for accommodation and meal expenses.
The Action Chair (or Vice Chair if the Action Chair
is aliated to the Grant Holder Institution) or the ap-
pointed STSM Coordinator / Committee can approve
dierentiated country rates to cover accommodationNovember 1, 2016 EvolDir 111
and meal expenses based on the perceived cost of living
in the host country.
*Eligibility*
The Applicant should normally be engaged in a program
of research as a post graduate student or postdoctoral fel-
low or be employed in an institution of a COST Country
having accepted the MoU of the Action. This institution
shall be actively participating in the COST Action. The
home and the host institution can be public or private.
A STSM may only be approved:
- from a home institution in a COST participating coun-
try to a host institution in a COST participating country
or to a formally approved host institution in a non-COST
country;
- from a formally approved home institution in a Near
Neighbour country to a host institution in a COST
participating country.
- The Applicant is responsible for obtaining the agree-
ment of the host institution, before submitting his/her
application.
- Early career investigators as well as researchers from
COST Inclusiveness Target Countries will be prioritized.

I'm contacting you on behalf of the H2020 project COR-
BEL (www.corbel-project.eu).
This cluster project of 11 research infrastructures aims
to support European researchers from academia and
industry and their advanced interdisciplinary research
projects by establishing a platform of aligned customised
services. Beginning of October we launched an Open
Call for research projects from academia and industry;
selected researchers will then have the unique opportu-
nity to gain open access to state-of-the-art technologies
and services oered by these research infrastructures
across biological and medical sciences. In order to dis-
tribute this Open Call to the scientic community, I
would like to ask whether it is possible that you com-
municate the announcement to your members.
A brief summary of the CORBEL Open Call: CORBEL
- Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Endur-
ing Life-science services - is an EC Horizon2020 project
uniting 11 Biological and Medical Science Research In-
frastructures (RIs). In CORBEL, the participating
RIs expand their cooperation in order to harmonise re-
searchers' access to their cutting-edge technologies and
services by establishing a sustainable platform of aligned
services that will enable faster admission to and a wider
portfolio of technologies and services to boost research
projects from academia and industry.
The CORBEL Open Call invites researchers to apply to
access technologies and services from more than 15 facil-
ities from eight dierent research infrastructures across
Europe. Selected projects will be allocated to so-called
Access Tracks and gain unprecedented opportunities to
utilise a wide range of high-end technologies and services.
These include state-of-the-art oers from the elds of ad-
vanced imaging, biobanking, curated databases, marine
model organisms, mouse mutant phenotyping, screening
and medicinal chemistry, structural biology as well as
systems biology.
Projects will be supported at every stage, with CORBEL
project managers on hand to help scientists navigate
between dierent service providers and exploit the full
potential of the oers available. The CORBEL consor-
tium already launched its Innovation Oce, consisting of
a well-experienced team dealing with the special needs
of industry (e.g. regarding IP issues, condentiality112 EvolDir November 1, 2016

EcoEvoTransparency PublicForum
Subject: new public forum: Transparency in EcoEvo
Announcing a new public forum devoted to fostering
transparency in ecology and evolution. This forum is
an email list called Transparency in EcoEvo. If you
are interested, please subscribe (see info at the bottom
of this message). If you are not sure what we mean
by transparency, read on. A core principle of science
is that we make progress as a eld when we are trans-
parent about our methods and the results we derived
from those methods. Unfortunately, we do not always
share sucient details of our methods, nor do we always
suciently share the outcomes of our research. However,
there is a growing movement to promote transparency
in ecology and evolution and in other disciplines, and
a number of recent publications have called attention
to this (see below for some examples). We hope the
Transparency in EcoEvo email list will foster continued
discussion of ideas related to transparency.

GenomeSeqAnalysis WebinarSeries
You're invited!
We are hosting a new webinar series with presentations
by representatives from genomic technology companies,
databases and research groups. Webinars will be 1 hour
long, but presentations will be kept short enough to
allow plenty of time for participants to ask questions.To get news about the webinars and other i5k activities,
please visit the i5k website and subscribe to the Arthro-
pod News mailing list at http://i5k.github.io/webinar
Webinars start on October 5th at 11am EDT and will
continue on the rst Wednesday of each month. We
have a great list of speakers, starting with Jonas Kor-
lach, Chief Scientic Ocer, and Sarah Kingan, Senior
Scientist Bioinformatics, from Pacic Biosciences.
Title: High-Quality De Novo Insect Genome Assemblies
using PacBio Sequencing
Summary: PacBio Sequencing is characterized by very
long sequence reads (average >10,000 bases), lack of
GC-bias, and high consensus accuracy. These features
have allowed the method to provide a new gold stan-
dard in de novo genome assemblies, producing highly
contiguous (contig N50 >1 Mb) and accurate ( >QV
50) genome assemblies. We will briey describe the
technology and then highlight the full workow, from
sample preparation through sequencing to data analysis,
on examples of insect genome assemblies, and illustrate
the dierence these high-quality genomes represent with
regard to biological insights, compared to fragmented
draft assemblies generated by short-read sequencing.
The webinar will be presented via AT&T Connect. To
join, see the instructions below. You can also access
these connection instructions along with information
about the webinar series on the i5k website at: http://-

PadovaU VolAssist SexualSelection
sh
Volunteer assistants are welcome to help with projects
on sexual selection in sh at the Hydrobiological
Station U. D'Ancona in Chioggia (Italy) (http://-
chioggia.biologia.unipd.it/en/hydrobiological-station/).
The Hydrobiological Station is a eld station of the
Department of Biology of the University of Padova
and directly overlooks the Lagoon of Venice, oering
an unique opportunity to easily access and study this
peculiar brackishwater environment and its species.
Two main research lines will be developed by our
research group (http://www.bio.unipd.it/ ~rasotto/-
index.htm) during the rst (15th March-31st May) and
the second (1st June-15th August) part of the eld
season respectively:
1.post-copulatory sexual selection in the grass goby, Zos-
terisessor ophiocephalus. We are particularly interested
in the role of sperm and non-sperm components of male
ejaculate and of female ovarian uid in determining the
outcome of post-copulatory sexual selection in this goby
species with alternative male mating tactics.
2.pre-copulatory female mate choice in the peacock
blenny, Salaria pavo. We will focus on the cognitive
mechanisms governing female choice for multiple male
traits in this species in which females have the oppor-
tunity to simultaneously or sequentially evaluate the
attractiveness of many males.
These topics are addressed by means of experiments
performed in captivity during the reproductive season
of the species of interest. Animals are directly collected
in their natural environment. Therefore the assistants
are expected to take part in both eld and lab work.
Duties: Assistants will help with - experimental set
up, including preparation of laboratories and aquaria
- sh sampling in the eld and their maintenance in
the lab - gametes, seminal and ovarian uid collection
and analyses (research line 1) - behavioural observations
(research line 2) - data entry and management - all the116 EvolDir November 1, 2016
other aspects of the projects, including discussions on
the conceptual frameworks.
The workweek will be typically 6 days long. Shifts will
be organised for animal taking care on Sundays (short
task). Scuba diving licence is a desired skill for research
line 2, although not mandatory.
Dates: Assistants can be involved in one of the two
research lines (half term) or both (full term).
Full term assistants: Start: ~15 March, End: ~15 Au-
gust 2017. (5 months) 1st Half term assistants: Start:
~15 March, End: ~31 May 2017. ( ~2.5 months) 2nd Half
term assistants: Start: ~1 June, End: ~15 August 2017.
(~2.5 months)
Costs: Accommodation is provided in a comfortable
guesthouse next to the Station, equipped with a lounge
and 3 bedrooms for a total of 10 persons. Assistants will
have to cover their food expenses, but a fully-equipped
kitchen is provided to prepare meals. Travel expenses
are not covered.
Guesthouse and laboratories are shared with other re-
search groups. This oer a stimulating research envi-
ronment, but requires the ability to get along well with
and be respectful of others.
Deadline: Until positions are lled
Application: Worldwide applicants are supported, al-
though must be uent in English. Please send a short
motivation letter stating why and for which period you
are interested and your CV via email to Lisa Locatello
(lisa.locatello@unipd.it) Shortlisted applications will be
notied by email, and candidates will be eventually
invited for a skype interview.

Modeling substitutional heterogeneity and its impact
on inferring relationships Nathan Whelan US Fish and
Wildlife Service Wednesday, October 26, 2016, 10:00
AM PDT
Heterogeneity in amino acid substitution is an inherent
feature of most phylogenomic-scale datasets, and model-
ing such heterogeneity is now widely seen as important
for phylogenomic inference. Site-heterogeneous substitu-
tion models such as CAT-F81 and CAT-GTR, as imple-
mented in PhyloBayes, have been forcefully advocatedfor use on large datasets because they may reduce long-
branch attraction artifacts that could result from not
adequately modeling amino acid substitutional hetero-
geneity. However, site-heterogeneous models arguably
became popular not because of a deep appreciation for
how well they modeled substitutional heterogeneity, but
rather because analyses with CAT models often resulted
in trees that matched preconceived notions of animal
phylogeny (e.g., sponges as the sister lineage to all other
extant animals). Importantly, site-heterogeneous mod-
els have not been thoroughly compared to other methods
for modeling substitutional heterogeneity such as coarse
modeling of heterogeneity with data partitioning cou-
pled with site-homogeneous models such as WAG or LG.
Here, I show through analyses of simulated and empirical
data that data partitioning often performs as well as, or
better than, site-heterogeneous CAT models. In contrast
to past claims, I demonstrate that partitioning with site-
homogeneous models suppresses long-branch attraction
artifacts as well as CAT-GTR and much better than
CAT-F81. Analyses with data partitioning and site-
homogeneous models can require orders of magnitude
less computational time than popular site-heterogeneous
models, while still resulting in reasonably accurate trees.
Although site-heterogeneous models may describe the
amino acid substitutional process much better than data
partitioning with site-homogeneous models, current im-
plementations of the most popular site-heterogeneous
models do not appear to result in more accurate phylo-
genetic hypotheses than those inferred with partitioning.
Thus, the need to model ne-scale site-heterogeneity in
phylogenetic inference is called into question.

Systematic errors in phylogenomic studies: on the
importance of modeling pattern-heterogeneity across
sites. Nicholas Lartillot Universit e de Lyon Wednesday,
November 16, 2016, 9:00 AM PSTNovember 1, 2016 EvolDir 117
While all models now used in phylogenetic analyses
account for rate-heterogeneity across sites, the case of
pattern-heterogeneity (i.e. qualitative variation in sub-
stitution processes across nucleotide or amino-acid posi-
tions) is much less clear and has recently been the sub-
ject of some controversy. One main question is whether
pattern-heterogeneity should be modelled at the level
of genes (or groups of genes), or at the level of sites.
Both approaches have been used in recent phylogenomic
analyses of metazoans, sometimes leading to radically
dierent conclusions, in particular concerning the early
patterns of diversication within this group.
In this talk, I will rst explore the empirical evidence
concerning the presence, and the relative importance, of
either type of heterogeneity in empirical sequence align-
ments. Then, I will introduce Dirichlet process mixture
models accounting for site-specic amino-acid prefer-
ences. The statistical meaning of Dirichlet processes,
as a non-parametric method for estimating arbitrary
distributions of site-specic eects, will be explained
and illustrated through simulation experiments. Finally,
based on simulations implementing pattern heterogene-
ity simultaneously at both the gene and the site levels,
I will show the importance of using models explicitly
accounting for pattern-heterogeneity across sites for
reconstructing accurate phylogenies. <https://t.co/-

ResearchSta US FLSA regulations
Dear Colleagues,
Our university is responding to the new FLSA regula-
tions by mandating that all full-time research sta be
paid a minimum of $47,476 per year, i.e., the same min-
imum as NIH prescribes for postdocs. This is regardless
of the level of training or experience of such sta. Need-
less to say, this has caused considerable consternation
among not only the postdocs, but also PIs who need to
optimize their personnel using limited resources from
federal funds. The category applies to full-time research
sta that are exempt from overtime compensation rules.
Our univeristy considers all full-time research personnel
to be exempt. (Part-time positions are allowed, but
overtime would have to be paid.)118 EvolDir November 1, 2016
My question for the EvolDir community is: If your uni-
versity has responded dierently, and allows at least
some full-time research personnel to escape this rule,
how have you accomplished this? For example, do you
have a particular employee category that is not exempt
from overtime rules and can thus be compensated at a
more reasonable rate? Also, what is your lab's strategy
for dealing with this new regulation?
Please respond directly to me at: df3@nyu.edu , and I
will collate results of this survey to share later.
Many thanks, Dave Fitch Biology, NYU

Software covmatcom R function
Dear EvolDir community,
I would like to announce the release of covmatcom - an R
function for the comparison of two datasets' covariance
matrices.
The function takes as input two datasets with measure-
ments (rows) for a set of variables (columns; the same
number of variables in the two datasets) and calculates
the two datasets' covariance matrices, measures the over-
all dierentiation between these matrices and separates
the contribution of matrix orientation and matrix shape
to the dierentiation. The function produces as output:
i) s1, an overall measure of matrix dierentiation, ii)
s2, measuring the contribution of dierences in matrix
orientation to s1, and iii) s3, measuring the contribution
of dierences in matrix shape to s1.

Volunteers needed December, Jan-April 2017
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation todroughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Applicants must have
an interest in working in the eld and with animals.
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6
AM), and stops its activity with dusk (7 PM). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40 ^AoC during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for
long periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part
of a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance of
the research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1500 (around 110 US $, 100 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok. Including extras
(going out for dinner; shopping), you should expect costs
of about 600 US $/ 450 Euros per month. Students get
an invitation letter which they can use to apply for
funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers to
start in December 2016 as well as beginning of 2017.
Volunteers are expected to stay for a minimum of 2-3
months, though longer periods are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-

Dear Colleagues,
Here is a post doctoral position opened in the EcoFun
Team at IRHS entitled *Did multiple hybridizations
that occurred during apple domestication promote se-
cretome diversication in its main pathogen **/Venturia
Inaequalis?/*/ /
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position to
study the evolutionary impact of host domestication on
the secretome of pathogens, in the EcoFun team of the
Horticulture and Seed Research Institute (IRHS). Our
lab conducts research on the interaction between the
scab fungus /Venturia inaequalis/and its host plants,
including domesticated and wild apple trees. We aim at
understanding how successive hybridization events be-
tween /Malus/species during apple domestication have
modied the pathogenicity determinants of /V. inae-
qualis/. Secreted eector proteins are known to be key
determinants of the virulence of fungal pathogens. Thus,
this project will focus on the polymorphism of the secre-
tome of /Venturia inaequalis/strains isolated on diverse
/Malus/hosts.
Addressing the original biological question of fungal
adaptation to successive new host plants will also pro-
vide new insights into how new fungal pathogens emerge.
Thanks to the well described evolutionary histories of124 EvolDir November 1, 2016
both /V. inaequalis/and /Malus /species, this project
addresses understudied questions on the prevalence of hy-
bridization over /de novo/mutations on pathogens adap-
tation to domestication of its host. The research will em-
ploy interdisciplinary approaches, including pathogenic-
ity data, genomic and RNA-seq analyses.Coalescence
based analyses of eectors evolution will allow to deter-
mine the origin of alleles that are segregating in strains
that infect domestic apple trees.The successful candi-
date will be expected to contribute to the writing and
submission of research publications.
*Job requirements*
Candidates should have obtained a PhD populations
genomic, genetics, evolutionary ecology. Skills in Next
Generation Sequencing data analyses are highly desir-
able. Experience in coalescent analysis and practical
knowledge in bioinformatics are advantageous. Candi-
dates must have prociency in oral and written English.
*Job details*
The position is full-time for 12 months. Net salary on
appointment will start from euro 2,000 to euro 2,500
per month depending on experience. The applicant will
have the possibility to obtain an additional mobility
allowance from the AgreenSkills+ scheme ranging from
euro 1,300 to euro 1,700 per month depending on expe-
rience. The applicant will be also encouraged to apply
to agreenskills to extend their stay up to 24 months
(www.agreenskills.eu).
*Application*
The position is available to start as soon as possible.

Project title: Molecular host adaptation of Epichloe
endophytes
Project description: Host specicity is an important con-
cept that underlies every association between microbes
and their hosts. An intriguing fungal system to study
host specicity, are the sexual species of genus Epichloe
(Ascomycota, Clavicipitaceae), which form systemic as-
sociations with grasses. The planned research aims to
explore the molecular genetic basis of host adaptation in
species or strains infecting dierent grass hosts. We are
interested in nding fungal genes that are responsible
for the observed host specicity and for establishing
systemic infections. Further, expression of candidate
genes at dierent stages of the fungal life cycle will be
investigated, and functional validation of genes using
decient mutant strains will be made. Epichloe endo-
phytes are of economic importance in agriculture and
turf grass industry, thus, knowledge of genetic factors
controlling symbiosis will increase their potential for
application.

BactCellEnvelopeEvolution
A 18-months (renewable) post-doctoral position is avail-
able in the Team \Microbial Phylogenomics" at the De-
partment of Microbiology to work in a multi-disciplinary
project focused on the evolution and biology of the cell
envelope of diderm Firmicutes.
General Information: The Research Group \Microbial
Phylogenomics" headed by Simonetta Gribaldo at theInstitut Pasteur, Paris (France) studies the diversity
and ancient evolutionary history of microorganisms
and their cellular processes by using phylogenomics
approaches (https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/group-
simonetta-gribaldo/). We have recently become inter-
ested in the Negativicutes, a peculiar lineage of the
Firmicutes (low GC Gram-positives) that stunningly
harbors an outer membrane with LPS, and that can
therefore shed light on the diversity and ancient evolu-
tion of bacterial cell envelopes, and the transition be-
tween Gram-positives (monoderms) and Gram-negatives
(diderms) (Antunes, Poppleton et al. Elife, 5, 3389). We
are currently addressing dierent aspects of the evolu-
tion and biology of the outer membrane of these poorly
studied bacteria, by combining bioinformatics analy-
ses and experimental work using as model Veillonella,
a common component of the human microbiome and
opportunistic pathogen.
The position is oered in the frame of the project \OM-
NEGA", funded by the Institut Pasteur and involving
a consortium of highly complementary expertise. It
includes the group of Christophe Beloin at the Institut
Pasteur-Paris and the group of Maria-Lina Bernardini
at the University \La Sapienza"-Rome (Institut Pasteur
Italy, Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti). With this pioneer-
ing project we wish to obtain further information on the
composition of the Negativicutes outer membrane and
its evolutionary history, identify factors involved in the
biolm-forming abilities of Veillonella and its interac-
tion with other relevant members of the gut microbiota
community, and understand its inuence on the host
immune system.
Project Description: The post-doctoral fellow to be
recruited will work more specically on Work Pack-
age 1 of the project (Bioinformatics/Comparative Ge-
nomics/Phylogenomics/Proteomics).
Over a hundred complete genomic sequences are cur-
rently available for the Negativicutes, and covering a
large taxonomic diversity of this clade. The post-doc
will develop a bioinformatic pipeline for the identi-
cation and functional annotation of candidate outer
membrane (OM) proteins from these genomes. These
analyses will be complemented by the experimental
characterization of the OM and surface exposed fraction
of representatives Negativicutes strains through pro-
teomics. The data collected will be subjected to detailed
comparative genomics analysis (taxonomic distribution,
co-occurrence patterns, synteny) to predict functions,
identify novel systems, and detect markers that may be
associated to specic adaptation to the human environ-
ment or pathogenicity. Finally, phylogenomic analysis
will be performed to dissect the evolutionary history
of specic cell envelope processes in the Negativicutes,130 EvolDir November 1, 2016
and clarify how the transition between monoderm and
diderm cell envelopes occurred in the Firmicutes.
Together, these data will allow building a comprehensive
view of the biogenesis and functioning of the atypical cell
envelope of the Negativicutes, its evolutionary origin,
and its relevance for human health.
Application Details: Candidates should hold a PhD and
have a strong background in computational biology and
evolutionary analyses. Experience in phylogenomics and
in the treatment of membrane protein sequence data
will be a plus. The fellow will be at the heart of the
project and be keen to interact with all members of the
interdisciplinary consortium. Some travel between Paris
and Rome might be planned during the project duration.
The position is oered for an initial 18 months period
with the possibility of extension. Starting date can be
as early as January 2017 and should be lled not later
than April 2017.
Please send a motivation letter including a brief state-
ment of research experience, technical expertise and in-
terest for the project, a full CV and list of publications
and the contact detail of three referees to Simonetta
Gribaldo (simonetta.gribaldo atpasteur.fr). Deadline
for application is December 31st 2016.

Postdoc position - \Evolutionary adaptation and physi-
ology of biological clocks"
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen,
Germany
The Max Planck Research Group \Biological Clocks"
(http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/biologicalclocks) combines
evolutionary genomics and molecular biology with be-
havioral experiments and ecological eldwork, aiming to
uncover the yet unknown molecular basis of circalunar
clocks. At the same time, we study the process of evolu-
tionary adaptation. Our model organism, the intertidal
midge Clunio marinus (Diptera), has timed its life cycle
to the rhythm of the tides using circalunar and circadian
clocks. As the tides dier along the coastline, the clocks
of Clunio populations are genetically adapted to the
local pattern of the tides. We have shown that these
evolutionary adaptations can be exploited for compara-
tive genomic and molecular studies in order to identify
new clock molecules (Nature, in press).
Clunio's circalunar clock can be set by moonlight, as
well as mechanical cues and temperature cues associ-
ated with the tides. The postdoc will work with Clunio
strains that are insensitive to certain time cues and try
to identify and characterize receptors responsible for
setting the circalunar clock.
The ideal candidate holds a PhD in Biology with a strongbackground in neurobiology, behavioral physiology or
molecular biology. Experience in receptor characteri-
zation, immunohistochemistry, genome editing or cell
culture are great assets. The postdoc will participate in
the genomic work related to the project. As a central
member of the group, the postdoc has good communi-
cation and organizational skills and will take part in
supervising students. We would especially welcome a
creative candidate interested in developing their own
ideas.
The position will be oered for 2 years with the possi-
bility of extension. Starting date is negotiable between
January and July 2017.
Applications should include a cover letter describing
your motivation to work on the respective project and
your relevant experience, a detailed CV and copies of
relevant certicates, and the contact details of three aca-
demic referees. Please send the above as a single PDF

A National Science Foundation-sponsored postdoctoral
position is now available in the Electric Fish Laboratory
in the Department of Integrative Biology at Michigan
State University (http://esh.zoology.msu.edu) concern-
ing the comparative genomics of weakly electric sh.
In sparky lablogo notextcontrast with most other verte-
brate traits, there have been six independent origins of
electrogenesis, the ability to generate electric discharges
from an electric organ, within shes. Despite their clear
benet as a model for understanding general principles
of parallel evolution of complex vertebrate tissues, we
know little about the molecular and developmental pro-
cesses underlying this tissue, which closely resembles
skeletal muscle see Gallant et al. 2012 Science. The
long-term goal of our laboratory is to characterize the
evolutionary steps that have occurred to modify the
developmental program in skeletal muscle to give rise to
the electric organ. Thanks in part to recently available
genomics resources, we are embarking on new compara-
tive approaches to identify gene regulatory networks and
regulatory regions that may be involved in the evolution
of electric organs. This position is available immediately,
but start dates are negotiable. Appointment for this
position will be initially for 12 months, with the pos-
sibility of renewal for up to three years, contingent on
the continued availability of funds as well as satisfactory
output of successful applicant.
Duties: The successful applicant will be responsible
for constructing genomic and transcriptomic libraries,
as well as their assembly and analysis using bioinfor-
matics tools in a high-performance computing environ-
ment. Work will require the development of new research
methodologies and tools, and publishing results in high-
impact journals. In addition, successful applicants will
be responsible for co-training undergraduate, graduate
students and technicians, as well as contributing to the
overall research environment of the University. Suc-
cessful applicant will be encouraged to participate in a
one-of-a-kind NSF-sponsored BEACON center for the
study of evolution in action ( http://bit.ly/GN0Rhx),
for which MSU is the host institution. Professional de-

ology, evolution, bioinformatics, genetics or related eld.
Publication of work based on Ph.D. thesis is required, as
well as teaching and supervisory experience. Experience
with comparative genomic and transcriptomic data, and
a strong working knowledge of next-generation sequenc-
ing technologies. Prociency in the use of UNIX/Linux
command line operating systems. Competence in at
least one computer scripting language (R, Python, Perl,
MATLAB). Must be willing and able to perform eld-

PostDoctoral Position in Evolution Education Research
Applications are being accepted for a postdoctoral re-
search position to work on an NSF-Funded project in
K-12 biology education research under the direction of
Drs. Peter White and Louise Mead at Michigan State
University. This is intended to be a four-year position,
pending successful annual performance reviews.
Overview: The recent synthesis of science education
research embodied by the National Research Council's
Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS) provides an in-
spiring vision for the high standards we know to be
important for the future success of both our students
and our nation. However, few or no curricula exist in
the eld of biology that have taken on the challenge of
integrating these three dimensions of science: the core
ideas of biology, the science and engineering practices,
and the crosscutting concepts-to support all students in
building toward sophisticated understandings of biologi-
cal phenomena. In this project, we intend to develop and
research learning materials with a focus on two related
areas of life science: the molecular basis for geneticsNovember 1, 2016 EvolDir 133
and the process of evolution by natural selection. These
two areas are documented as being dicult to teach
and learn. They are also interlinked, spanning multiple
biological scales, yet have historically been taught sepa-
rately. Recent development in integrative case curricu-
lum by the Evo-Ed project (www.evo-ed.org) provides
the needed content for a connected set of lessons that
can be used as the basis for generating and researching
three-dimensional teaching materials aligned with the
performance expectations of the NGSS. We will examine
how, and how far, students can progress when learn-
ing from coherent sequences of learning materials that
employ the principles of three-dimensional learning.
Required Qualications: A PhD in one of the follow-
ing elds is required: biology, biology education, or
K-12 education (paired with a BSc or an MSc in Biol-
ogy). Candidates must demonstrate a strong knowledge
of K-12 biology teaching and/or research, and have a
working knowledge of the NGSS. Candidates must have
excellent communication skills, knowledge and use of
web-based technologies, a working knowledge of multi-
variate statistics and databases, and skills in managing
and coordinating a study at a national scale.
Responsibilities: The postdoc will work closely with Drs.
White and Mead on the design, development and testing
of curriculum materials, data collection and analysis,
and working with teachers. The postdoc will play a
signicant role adapting Evo-Ed's integrative cases of
evolution for a K-12 setting. This will include the devel-
opment of learning outcomes and activities for middle-
and high school classrooms. The postdoctoral research
associate will be involved in preparing publications aris-
ing from the research conducted in this project. They
will participate in manuscript planning, data analysis,
drafting manuscript sections, submitting to appropri-
ate journals, and responding to manuscript reviewer
comments.
To apply: Submit an application letter, curriculum
vitae, teaching philosophy, and complete contact in-
formation for three references to Dr. Peter White
(pwhite@msu.edu). Review of application materials
will begin on Monday October 31 and continue until the
position is lled.

Postdoctoral opportunity to study the genomic basis for
thermal tolerance and local adaptation in sh popula-
tions
The Meek Lab at Michigan State University is looking
for a highly motivated postdoctoral scholar to study
the genomic basis for thermal tolerance and local adap-
tation in brook trout of the Northeast US. The lab
uses eld collections and experiments, combined with
next-generation sequencing data, to address fundamen-
tal ecological questions that are highly relevant to the
conservation and management of species. The project
that will be the focus of this post-doc aims to address
two questions, using brook trout as a model system:
1. Are there dierences in gene expression patterns
among sh from populations with dierent thermal his-
tories?
2. Are there regions of the genome associated with
dierences in susceptibility and phenotypic response to
thermal stress?
We will be using this information to develop an approach
for assessing the genetic diversity associated with ther-
mal adaptation in other brook trout populations. The
information gained from this study will be invaluable for
understanding the molecular basis for local adaptation
and its relation to climate change resiliency planning,
and in designing management actions that sustain brook
trout into the future.
The initial hire is for one year, with potential for an
additional year of funding upon satisfactory review of
progress. The position will be based in the Depart-
ment of Integrative Biology at Michigan State Univer-
sity. Start date is negotiable, but the ideal is winter or
spring 2017.
*Qualications* Applicants should have a PhD in ecol-
ogy, evolution, genetics, bioinformatics, or related elds.
We are looking for a creative and talented scientist with
a good publication record and excellent organizational
and communication skills. We are especially interested
in candidates with a strong computational background
and previous experience with next-generation sequenc-
ing data analysis. Experience working in the Unix envi-
ronment is essential and familiarity with one or several
programming languages is highly desirable.134 EvolDir November 1, 2016

Moulis EvolutionaryGenomics
Post-doctoral fellowship in Evolutionary Genomics
A post-doctoral position is available for two years at
the Station for Theoretical and Experimental Ecology
(Moulis, France) in the eld of evolutionary genomics.
Project objectives
The main objective of the project is to determine the
molecular bases of an organisms' response to envi-
ronmental changes using an Evolve and Resequence
framework. The candidate will compare the pat-
terns of genome/transcriptome evolution of laboratory
lines of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila submit-
ted to divergent environmental treatments. By relating
whole genome/transcriptome proles to the phenotypic
changes observed both between and within strains, and
by searching for footprints of selection, the candidate
would determine some of the molecular mechanisms
responsible for phenotypic response to environmental
variation. The candidate will also develop SNPs to al-
low discrimination of our laboratory lines which have
been used in several microcosm experiments. In par-
ticular, he/she will analyze the genetic composition of
experimental meta-populations that were confronted to
dierent climatic scenarios in a fragmented landscape.
The candidate will lead a genomic network within
the Station for Theoretical and Experimental Ecology.
He/she will organize regular meetings with members of
the lab performing analyses of NGS datasets in order
to share information on bioinformatics and biostatistics
pipelines. The candidate will thus collaborate on several
ongoing genomic projects including the transcriptomic
analysis of individuals with dierent dispersal abilitiesNovember 1, 2016 EvolDir 135
in butteries. In addition, it would be relevant if the
candidate is interested in participating in the ongoing
thought in Moulis about the impact of the use of omics
in ecology (e.g. much increased environmental footprint
or increased disconnection with non-scientists).
Candidate prole
The ideal candidate should have a PhD in the eld of
genomics with expertise in bioinformatics and biostatis-
tics. Good knowledge in evolutionary ecology and the
molecular basis of evolution is strongly recommended.
The candidate should also have good communication
skills, and should be autonomous and organized.
Contact
The position will remain open until lled. The preferred
starting date is January 2017, but can be adapted as a
function of the candidate's availability. To apply, please
send a cover letter, CV, summary of past work, and
two letters of recommendation to Herve Philippe and
Delphine Legrand.

A three-year postdoctoral position is available to work
with Dr. Stephen Cameron, Professor and Head of En-
tomology, Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana)
on mitochondrial genome evolution in lice. Parasitic
lice (Psocodea: Phthiraptera) have the highest rates of
genome evolution yet observed in an insect, including
very high rates of genome rearrangement, a class of
mutation very rare in other insect groups. As part of
the Paraneoptera Tree of Life project (an NSF AToL
award) we are investigating the patterns, rates and
causes of mitochondrial genome evolution in lice. Ad-
ditionally, we are asking which aspects of their ecology,
host-associations and/or nuclear genomic factors predis-
pose lice to such high rates of mitochondrial mutation.
The candidate should have a PhD in the elds of phy-
logenomics or bioinformatics and expertise in the as-
sembly and annotation of next-gen sequencing datasets.
Experience with the scripting and analytical pipelines
used in contemporary phylogenomic studies are essen-
tial. Molecular wet-lab experience in targeted sequenc-
ing to supplement genome assemblies is desirable. The
successful candidate will be joining one of America's
largest Entomology departments with active research

/post.queensu.ca/ ~birdpop/index.html As numerically
dominant apex predators, seabirds are key components
of Canada's arctic marine ecosystem. Seabirds and
their eggs also are important to the culture and diet
of indigenous Arctic peoples. However, Arctic seabird
populations are facing multiple simultaneous direct and
indirect threats from climate change, shipping and in-
dustrial development. Unsurprisingly, many populations
are showing signs of stress such as reduced reproduc-
tive success or declining numbers. To avoid extinction,
wildlife populations must adapt through (1) changes in
behaviour or physiology, (2) dispersal, or (3) genetic
changes. The capacity for seabirds to adapt through
these three avenues is virtually unknown, but it is criti-
cal to maintenance of healthy populations. New genomic
methods, especially when combined with on-going stud-
ies of behaviour and physiology, provide powerful oppor-
tunities to determine the long-term sensitivities of Arctic
seabirds to climate change and industrial development.
We will use genomic, behavioural and ecological data
in a landscape context to estimate levels of phenotypic
plasticity, dispersal, and genomic variation for seven
seabird species that Canada has a global responsibility138 EvolDir November 1, 2016

Change Canada (ECCC) develop science-based policies

of hybridised populations to respond to environmental
change. The model can be directly applied to inform
the sustainable management and/or restoration of wild
populations in addition to the improvement of aquacul-

novel ideas: e.g. (1) the use of a archives and pedigrees

gene x environment interactions; (2) identify SNPs as
biomarkers linked to metabolic potential; (3) to study of
divergent selection in the farm sh in the wild relative

microbiomes and the application of assays for compre-

This project is devoted to evolutionary genetic analysis
of mineralising marine phytoplankton, such as diatoms
and coccolithophores, that play an important role in
global carbon cycle, being the dominant contributors
to carbon sink to the deep ocean. Although phyto-
plankton has attracted a lot of attention from climatol-

evolutionary genetics. Our study will help to ll this
void. The successful candidate will have strong inter-
est in evolutionary genetics and signicant experience
in population genetic and phylogenetic data analysis.
Previous experience with marine evolutionary genet-
ics as well as high-throughput sequence data analysis,
programming/scripting and unix environment will be a
signicant advantage. For further details please contact

This project is at the interface between evolutionary
genetics, palaeontology and climatology, and involves
a collaboration between Oxford departments of Plant
Sciences (Prof. Dmitry Filatov) and Earth Sciences
(Prof. Ros Rickaby). The grant is held by Prof Dmitry
Filatov and the work is to be conducted in his lab in
the Department of Plant Sciences, Oxford. Filatov's lab
is part of a broader Oxford community of evolutionary
biologists and geneticists based in the departments of

Postdoc in evolutionary and developmental genetics at
the University of Pennsylvania, USA
We are seeking a creative and exceptionally motivated
candidate to ll a post-doctoral position in the eld of
evolutionary and developmental genetics.
Research in the Kamberov lab is directed at uncovering
the genetic basis of human adaptive traits, with a core
focus on the evolution of skin appendages, namely sweat
glands and hair follicles. In this pursuit, we utilize a
highly interdisciplinary approach that combines mouse
and human genetics with developmental biology and
evolutionary genomics. The culmination of this research
program is to not only enhance the understanding of
human evolution but also to apply what we have learned
in translational eorts that lead to the improvement of
human health and alleviation of disease, particularly in
the context of skin and skin appendage regeneration.

PopulationGenomicsBees
We are looking for two postdocs to join Matthew Web-
ster's group working on evolutionary genomics and pop-
ulation genomics. Research in this group currently fo-
cuses on two main areas: 1) the genetic basis of local
adaptation and 2) the evolution of recombination. We
use multiple species of bees to study these questions.
The research primarily involves population-scale genome
sequencing and bioinformatic/statistical analyses, but
there are also opportunities for eld/apiary work and
molecular genetics lab work.
A good summary of the research focus can be gained
from the following publications:
*Wallberg A, Han F, Wellhagen G, Dahle B, Kawata
M, Haddad N, Sim ~Aes ZL, Allsopp MH, Kandemir
I, De la R ~Aoa P, Pirk CW, Webster MT. (2014). A
worldwide survey of genome sequence variation provides
insight into the evolutionary history of the honeybee
Apis mellifera. Nat Genet. 46(10):1081-8.
*Wallberg A, Gl emin S, Webster MT. (2015). Extreme
recombination frequencies shape genome variation and
evolution in the honeybee, Apis mellifera. PLoS Genet.

*Wallberg A, Pirk CW, Allsopp MH, Webster MT.
(2016). Identication of multiple loci associated
with social parasitism in honeybees. PLoS Genet.
12(6):e1006097.
The successful candidates will to work on new and ongo-
ing projects under the two main research focuses. The
main duties involve analysis of next-generation sequenc-
ing data, including processing of raw data, and statis-
tical analysis using population/evolutionary genetics
methods. Involvement in sample collection, molecular
genetics and teaching/supervision of students is also
possible depending on requirements of the projects and
interests of the candidate. Successful candidates should
be procient in bioinformatics and statistics, ideally
including perl scripting, analysis of next-gen sequenc-ing data and population genetics. A strong interest in
evolution and social insects is also desirable. Excellent
communication skills and high level of motivation are
required. Good spoken and written English is required.
Employment will be initially for one year with possibility
of extension.
If you are interested in the position, you are encour-
aged to make an informal enquiry to Matthew Webster,

A position in the group of Dr. Eva Forsgen in Uppsala:
Postdoctoral position in statistical epidemiology and
modelling
A two year full time position is available for a highly
motivated post doc to take a central role in statistical
epidemiology modelling projects for honeybee parasites
and infectious diseases. The position will be located
with the honeybee research group at the Department
of Ecology at the Swedish University of Agricultural
Sciences in Uppsala. The honeybee research group has
close collaboration with e.g. the Swedish Beekeepers
Associations, the national bee health advisor and the152 EvolDir November 1, 2016
National Veterinary Institute (SVA). The position is
based at the Ecology Centre at the Swedish University
of Agricultural Sciences, in Uppsala, Sweden. The centre
conducts research on sustainable agriculture, forest pro-
duction and biological conservation. This includes both
fundamental and applied research on communities and
ecosystems and the inuences of land use and climate
on animals, plants, soil nutrient status and greenhouse
gas balance. This research forms the basis for solutions
to mitigate climate change, preserve threatened species,
and benet biological diversity and ecosystem services
and control pests in managed agricultural, forested and
urban landscapes. Active dissemination, outreach and
frequent contacts with stakeholders are key activities.
Duties: The postdoc will develop and implement quan-
titative dynamic epidemiological models to predict the
risk of honeybee colony disease and mortality in relation
to alternative treatment and management options. The
project will evaluate existing veterinary epidemiologi-
cal models and adapt these to incorporate honeybee-
specic parameters. The models will apply data from
various sources (e.g. biological, bioinformatic, seasonal,
geographic, anonymized survey, treatment and disease
data) and integrate dierent measures of epidemiological
risk and uncertainty (e.g. odds ratios, expert knowl-
edge, semi-quantitative measures). Qualications: A
PhD degree in veterinary epidemiology, statistics or a
related eld. Experience in mathematical modelling.
Applicants are expected to have a well-documented in-
terest in epidemiological-statistical research, expertise
with database development and management of large
datasets as well as the design and statistical analysis of
epidemiological and experimental studies. Documented
ability to independently scientic research and ability to
produce scientic publications is necessary. The appli-
cant is expected to have good English oral and written
communication skills and well-developed ability to co-
operate. Experience with honeybees is advantageous
but not required. As postdoctoral appointments are
career-developing positions for junior researchers, we
are primarily looking for candidates with a doctoral
degree that is three years old at most.

We are looking for A promising alternative to the appli-
cation of chemical pesticides is the implementation of
crops resistant to insect pests. The goal of this research
project is to unravel the genetic basis and molecular
mechanism involved in a plant defence trait that is lethal
to insect eggs. Plants can resist the onset of herbivore154 EvolDir November 1, 2016
attack by perceiving and responding to insect eggs. The
consequences of plant responses to eggs are that insect
larvae do not hatch or that they are impeded in develop-
ment, and damage to the plant is reduced. Up to now,
little is known on the mechanisms and on the genetic
basis of egg-killing traits but potentially may be tied to
the egg microbiome. Making use of egg-killing defense
traits in crops is a promising new way to sustainably
reduce losses of crop yield. As a postdoctoral student
you will characterize the egg-derived molecule(s) of an
egg-killing trait in a cabbage crop resembling responses
to pathogen attack (i.e. hypersensitive response). You
will explore the egg microbiome and its role herein by us-
ing the latest sequencing techniques, use proteomics and
mass spectrometry techniques to conquer insect-related
molecules and validate candidate molecules using mu-
tants. This project is part of a NWO/STW VIDI project
and executed in close collaboration with vegetable breed-
ing and seed companies. You will be co-supervising a
PhD student who focuses on nding the genetic basis of
this plant trait, and supported by a technician as well as
collaborating with researchers at Wageningen University,
national and international institutes with expertise in
population genetics, plant and insect (phylo)genomics,

Berlin 16Smetabarcoding Apr3-7
16SrRNA gene metabarcoding workshop
Monday 3rd to Friday 7th April 2017 in Berlin, Germany
http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course8/ In-
structor: Dr. Alexandre Barretto de Menezes
(http://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t5/)
Overview:
The 16s rRNA gene has become the standard marker for
prokaryote phylogenetic analysis, and combined with
high-throughput sequencing technologies it is widely
used to infer the structure and composition of microbial
communities. Due to the continuous improvements in
sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, there
is a wide choice of methods for sequencing and analysing
16S rRNA gene assemblies. This workshop is designed
to give students the necessary background and prac-
tical experience of the strategies for the analysis of
the diversity and structure of prokaryote communities,
covering i) experimental design and primer choices; ii)
wet-lab and library preparation options; iii) sequence
quality control and analysis and iv) statistical analysis
of microbial community data. The many sequencing
and analysis options will be discussed, whereas a more
in-depth tutorial using real sequence data will provide
an opportunity for the student to practice 16S rRNA
sequence analysis from raw sequence les to ecological
interpretation. Course material, such as presentation
slides and necessary model data, will be provided to the
students.
Targeted audience and assumed background:
This workshop is intended for students and researchers
interested in microbial ecology but who are not yet very
familiar with the techniques involved.Choosing the ap-
propriate primers, library preparation kits, sequencing
methodologies and bioinformatics pipelines can be quite158 EvolDir November 1, 2016
daunting to the uninitiated. This workshop will allow
researchers interested more condence in their method-
ology and analyses choices.The target audience include
students of animal or plant microbiomes as well as those
studying environmental microbial communities. It is
assumed that the workshop attendees are interested in
performing 16S rRNA metabarcoding using the Illumina
MiSeq platform, although other sequencing technologies
will be discussed during the workshop.
Knowledge of Linuxand R or familiarity with working
in the command line will be helpful, but for those new
to the area detailed instructions will allowstudents to
follow the workshop. Students will need to have a com-
puter running either onLinux or a Linux virtual machine
running on MacOX/Windows computers. Contact the
instructor at ademez@gmail.com if in doubt about com-
putational requirements.
Where:
Seminar room at Molecular Parasitology, Humboldt-
Universitat zu Berlin, Philippstr. 13, Haus 14, 10115
Berlin
Workshop structure:
The workshop will consist of both lectures and practical
classes. Background information will be provided to
help workshop attendees choose the appropriate experi-
mental design, primers, sequencing library preparation
kits and to contextualise the bioinformatics and sta-
tistical analysis methods. Practical tutorials will be
conducted on a step-by-step basis to guide the student
from when receiving data from a sequence provider to ob-
taining plots and tables describing microbial community
diversity, structure and relationships to environmental
variables or host data.

Berlin ScienticWriting Mar28-29
Course: \Scientic Writing: organization and moti-
vation booster" 28-29 March 2017 in Berlin Germany
http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course7/ In-
structor: Dr. Andrea Sanchini http://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t7/ Overview Scientic writing
is hard. Young students have diculties in writing their
articles or theses and at the same time carrying out
their research projects. Supervisors and Professors have
diculties to train younger scientists in scientic writ-
ing. In addition, the standards for the publication of160 EvolDir November 1, 2016
research articles and other scientic documents are in-
creasing. This course is intended to be very pragmatic:
we will develop a set of how-to information for writing
research articles and for increasing writing productivity.
The aim of this course is to give to participants the
knowledge and the tools to change and improve their
routine writing activities. At the end of the course the
participants will became more organized and motivated
in scientic writing.
Teaching format The instructor provides lectures and
tips from own writing experience. Participants will do
writing exercises individually and in groups in order to
apply the knowledge acquired during the lectures. The
instructor provides also practical examples on how to
use software useful for scientic writing. There will be
enough time to share feedback and challenges in group
discussions. Preparing for the course During the course,
participants can draft part of their next writing project
(one to two pages). This project can be a research ar-
ticle or a thesis. Therefore participants are asked to
decide in advance which writing task they want to do
during the course.
Intended audience The course is especially useful for
PhD candidates of Natural, Life and Social Sciences
faculties at any stage of their PhD. The course is also
useful for young students such as Bachelor and Master
Students of the same faculties in order to make them
already familiar with the process of scientic writing.
More experienced scientists and researchers can also
take advantage of the course, since they can improve
their writing skills and productivity.
Course Program
1st Day Session 1: Challenges in scientic writing In
the rst session of the course participants will get famil-
iar with the basic principles of scientic writing. The
instructor will show the common challenges and typical
blocks regarding scientic writing. The instructor will
also show misconceptions about scientic writing and
wrong habits that lead to write slowly and to produce
poor texts. The participants will then learn about the
dierent stages of the writing process, and how to eec-
tively organize their writing projects. At the end of the
session participants will also explore the most common
causes of unclear scientic writing.
Session 2: Structure of a research article Here the in-
structor presents the main sections of a research articles:
Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References
and Abstract. Particular importance will be given to
the paragraph structure, which can be used as basic
writing unit of a research article. The instructor will
also present how to manage the ow of information in
scientic writing.2nd Day Session 3: Figures and Tables In this session
the instructor will explain how to eectively present the
scientic information in gures and tables in a clear and
unambiguous way. In addition, information on how to
write gure and table legends will also be provided.
Session 4: Writing productivity Here the instructor
shows the dierent types of writers and their respective
advantages and disadvantages for scientic writing. The
instructor will show several techniques, software and
motivational tools to increase the writing productivity
and remove writers' blocks. The aim is to show that
writing productivity is a skill that can be learned and
mastered with discipline and commitment.
Session 5: Self- and team-management of the writing
process In the last session the instructor will focus on
the management part of scientic writing. Specically
the team work among co-authors and supervisors, how
to organize the time eectively in order to reach the
writing goals, how to plan the writing projects and how
to increase eciency through self-assessment.
Further information: The cost is 350 euros (VAT in-
cluded) including refreshments and course materials.
We also oer an all-inclusive package at 460 euros (VAT
included), including breakfast, lunch, dinner, refresh-
ments, accommodation, course and transfer from/to the
main city's airports.

CostaRica Ferns Jan6-22
Hello all,
This is just a reminder that the deadline for the Tropical
Ferns and Lycophytes course is coming up.
The course costs $2,100 per student, but OTS member
tuition is just $1,400 per student after applying a $700
OTS scholarship. The tuition fee includes all station
fees, room and board during the two-and-a-half week

Tropical Ferns and Lycophytes 50th Anniversary Course
dates: January 6 - 22, 2017 Application deadline: Octo-
ber 10, 2016 (followed by rolling admissions)
Tropical Ferns and Lycophytes course has impacted
many pterodologists since its inception in 1967. It is an
intensive, 17-day eld introduction to the identication,
classication, phylogenetics, ecology and reproductive
biology of tropical ferns and lycophytes for up to 22
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and researchers
in the elds of ecology, botany and conservation biology
who require a broad knowledge of fern and lycophytes bi-
ology. This course is designed to build the diverse skills
needed for oristic, taxonomic, phylogenetic and eco-
logical research on tropical ferns. Topics include: fern
ecology, fern ecophysiology, reproductive and gameto-
phyte ecology, methods of eld collection and specimen
preparation. Building upon this foundation, students
will develop their own research projects. In past edi-
tions of this course, this has led in a few instances to
publishable research results.
Barbara Joe Hoshizaki was one of the students to take
the rst OTS Tropical Ferns course. The course had
an important impact on Dr. Hoshizaki ^As career and
marked the work she would carry out through her life-
time, most notably her Fern Grower's Manual, which
she later revised and expanded with Dr. Robbin Moran
(2001).
50 years later, the OTS ferns course, led by Robbin C.
Moran, Nathaniel Lord Britton Curator of Botany, In-
stitute of Systematic Botany of the New York Botanical
Garden, continues to be a key course for pterodologists.
As testament to Dr. Hoshizaki, the Hoshizaki family
established the Barbara Joe Hoshizaki Memorial Schol-
arship Fund for students interested in the course and
courses in Plant Systematics.
To apply for a Barbara Joe Hoshizaki Memorial Schol-
arship and participate in the 50th Anniversary of the

EvoS-2
organized by Filipa Vala jNovember 21-December 16
2016 @ Lisbon, Portugal
Objectives: Evolutionary theory provides a framework
for understanding all living systems. Nevertheless,
throughout the 20 ^th century, with a few exceptions,
evolutionary biologists have \avoided" using evolution
to address problems related to our own species. EvoS
is a program created by David Sloan Wilson at the
University of Binghamton, and later adopted at other
faculties that have joined into the EvoS international
consortium. EvoS aims at turning evolutionary theory
into a common language to areas that pertain to the
natural world, including human aairs. This advanced
course is part of the EvoS programme at the University
of Lisbon.

ability to initiate a phylogenetic analysis starting from
the les of molecular sequences until the interpretation
of the results and the graphics. The introduction will
cover a brief historical background and an overview of
the dierent methods of phylogenetic inference. Dier-
ent kinds of data will be considered, but with a special
emphasis on DNA sequences. The software used will
be based on R and several specialized packages (par-
ticularly ape and phangorn). Other software will be
used (e.g., MAFFT, MUSCLE or Clustal) called from
R. Overall, the course will cover almost all aspects of
phylogenetic inference from reading/downloading the
data to plotting the results. This course is intended for
PhD and postgraduate students, researchers and engi-
neers in evolutionary biology, systematics, population
genetics, ecology, conservation.
Course content is as follows Day 1 - Refresher on R:
data structures, data manipulation with the indexing
system, scripts, using the help system. - Introduction
to phylogenetic inference. - Basics on phylogenetic data
(sequences, alignments, trees, networks, \splits") and
other data in R. - Reading / writing data from les
or from internet. - Matching data. Manipulating la-
bels. Subsetting data. - Main package: ape. Day 2 -

MorphometricsOnlineCourse
Nov7-Dec16
Dear colleagues
This is a reminder that the deadline to register for
this year's morphometrics course from the University of
Manchester is 21 October. So there is just over a week
left!
This year's course will run via the web in the six weeks
from 7 November to 16 December 2016.
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Denitions
of size and shape * Geometric methods to characterise
shape from a conguration of landmark points (Pro-
crustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation, scat-
ter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal com-
ponent analysis * Measurement error and outliers *
Shape transformations and 'warping' { the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing
between groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) *
Allometry and size correction * Inuence of external
factors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response studies)
* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics
of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives,
QTL analyses. * Phylogeny: examining the history of
evolutionary changes of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometricstudies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.

Winter School - Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics
(B@G3 2017)
DATE: February 5-11, 2017
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The application of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to non-model
organisms is now well-established and has unlocked new
frontiers for research on adaptation genomics. Despite
recent technological developments enabling an increas-
ing number of projects to use genome-scale data, the
analysis of such complex data sets still raises substan-
tial hurdles for researchers with primarily a biologicalNovember 1, 2016 EvolDir 167
background. Bioinformatic pipelines oer an invaluable
resource to process genomic data, but their underlying
rationale often remains hard to understand, which poses
signicant challenges for their rigorous use and for the
accurate interpretation of the results. The B@G Win-
ter School provides an opportunity for researchers to
penetrate the black box' behind the complex bioinfor-
matics approaches available for investigating adaptation
genomics throughout the analytical pipeline; from the
programs and assumptions necessary to produce a high
quality SNP dataset to the in-depth interpretation of
methods designed to address key evolutionary questions.
B@G teachers are established scientists with a primary
role in the development of widely used bioinformatic
software, and will provide insights into the foundations
of the algorithms and suggest best practice in experi-
mental design and analysis.
AUDIENCE The School is primarily aimed at evolu-
tionary biologists and bioinformaticians who want to
gain deeper knowledge on state-of-the-art methods used
to detect evolutionary patterns from genome-wide nu-
cleotide data. Applications from early career researchers
(PhD and post-doctoral level), as well as faculty with a
background in ecology, genetics, or bioinformatics, will
be considered. The workshop is particularly aimed at
candidates with experience of the Unix environment and
with preliminary knowledge on analytical pipelines for
genomic data.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch).
COST Total fee for participants is 750.- CHF. This in-
cludes tuition and accommodation in double rooms with
full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
at the Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop. A
limited number of single rooms may be available upon
request at an additional fee of 300.- CHF.
REGISTRATION The workshop will be limited to 30
participants. We ask that all interested participants
submit a cover letter (1 page max) detailing their re-
search interests, their level of bioinformatics experience,
and motivation for attending the workshop, as well as
their CV (2 pages max) to BioinfAdapt@env.ethz.ch by
November 20th 2016. Participants will be notied of
the outcome of the selection process by December 5th
2016.

the ecological genomics of coevolutionary interactions.
These instructors will introduce workshop participants
to modern concepts, models and methods that are widely
being used or are currently being developed. The rst
four days of the workshop will consist of lectures and
practical demonstrations given by the instructors, fol-
lowed by hands-on exercises performed by the partici-
pants under guided supervision. The lectures will focus
on current topics and latest developments relevant for168 EvolDir November 1, 2016
investigating ecogenomics of coevolutionary interactions
(see program: inferring co-demographic histories and
testing for co-adaptation). Participants will focus on
datasets provided by the instructors in the light of new
developments. On the fth day, thematic talk sessions
with presentations from invited speakers and selected
participants will illustrate current research on the eco-
logical genomics of coevolution. In order to enhance
discussions during the ve-day workshop, we will also
ask participants to present a poster of their own work on
the rst day to introduce themselves and their research
topic.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.November 1, 2016 EvolDir 169
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
