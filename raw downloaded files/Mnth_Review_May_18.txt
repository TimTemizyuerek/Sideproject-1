UMichigan PlantEnvInteractions
Sep27-28
This is a conference announcement that will be of inter-
est to evolutionary biologists and evolutionary geneti-
cists.
Dear all,
I am excited to announce that registration has opened
for the University of Michigan's 2nd annual Green Life
Sciences Symposium, to be held Sept 27th and 28th,
2018, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI.
This year's theme is \*Plant-environment interactions
across scales*".
We are currently soliciting talks and poster presenta-
tions. Below is more information about the symposium,
along with a list of conrmed speakers and links to
registration.
We hope you will be able to join us for the GLS sympo-
sium in the fall. Please pass along this opportunity to
students and postdoctoral research associates, as well
as any other potentially interested parties.
Best wishes, Gina Baucom

& Panelist ListCost: FREEPlants interact with both
a variety of community members (other plants, the
microbial community, pollinators, herbivores) and are
exposed to a variety of abiotic environmental stressors
(drought and changing climate, human-mediated agents
of selection). These interactions are often examined at
the phenotypic level by evolutionary ecologists whereas
the mechanistic basis of such interactions are detailed
by molecular geneticists; longer-term outcomes of such
interactions are assessed by paleobiologists. It is rare
however that plant-environment interactions are exam-
ined across scales within the same system, i.e. from
genes, to molecular mechanism, phenotype, tness, and
deeper evolutionary patterns across time. The aim of
this conference is to highlight the work of prominent evo-
lutionary ecologists, molecular geneticists, ecophysiolo-
gists, and paleobiologists at the University of Michigan
and beyond that examine similar plant-interaction phe-
nomena but at very dierent scales of study. Our overall
goal is to stimulate new collaborations and novel takes on
overlapping phenomenon studied across scales.Format
& Participation Opportunities:Researchers will present
their work during ve sessions and have ample time
for networking at coee breaks. We are accepting a
small number of outside presentations appropriate to
any of our ve main sub-themes via self-nomination.
Early career researchers (undergraduate and graduate
students, postdoctoral research scholars, assistant profes-
sors) are likewise encouraged to present a poster during
the Thursday evening poster session which will be held
at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens.If you wish to be con-
sidered for a talk, please submit an abstract, 250 words
or less, in the eld indicated in the registration form by
May 1st, 2018. In the text, indicate if you would like to
be considered for a poster presentation if we are unable
to oer you a talk. Spaces for talks will be limited.A
limited amount of funds are available to help oset the
cost of travel or room and board for early-career re-
searchers who are presenting either a talk or a poster;
funding decisions will be made by the organizing com-
mittee before June. If you would like to be considered
for travel funds, please email Gina Baucom with this
information by May 1, 2018.Registration for this confer-
ence is free, and a dinner will be held Thursday night
(Sept 27, 2018) for conference speakers and poster pre-
senters. (Link to register: https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/-

Brno CzechRepublic
EvolInfectiousDiseases
The Laboratory for infectious diseases common to hu-
mans and (non-human) primates based at the Institute
of Vertebrate Biology Czech Academy of Sciences and
University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Science
Brno is searching for a PhD candidate for highly ambi-
tious topic with applications to conservation of critically
endangered iconic mountain gorillas.
Title: Epidemiology of helminth infections in great apes
with emphasis on mountain gorillas in Virunga Massif
in Rwanda
Background: In non-human primates gastrointestinal
parasites are typically asymptomatic, but habitat re-
duction and fragmentation can alter the transmission
and increase host susceptibility, which may exacerbate
the eects of infection. There is considerable concernthat in fragile or threatened non-human primate popu-
lations, these cascading eects can signicantly aect
species survival. Due to eective conservation eorts,
the population of critically endangered mountain gorillas
(Gorilla beringei beringei) at Virunga has been steadily
increasing. Fast increase of the whole population and
increase in the home range overlap in particular can lead
to elevated risks of changes in pathogens' epidemiology.
Project: The student will investigate the dynamics of
parasite-host system and impact of parasites in several
gorilla populations at individual and population level
and causal-eects events with focus on mountain gorillas
at Virunga in Rwanda . The study will benet from (i)
complex sampling design conducted on Rwandan, Ugan-
dan and Congolese populations of mountain gorillas in
collaboration with Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project
and Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and (ii) our
previous long-term research on western lowland gorillas,
providing extensive set of genomics/metagenomics data
for planned statistical analyses.
Funding: research costs and partial salary (in add to
a governmental stipend) covered by a grant by Czech12 EvolDir May 1, 2018
Science Foundation.
Qualications: Applicants with master degree in bi-
ological orveterinary should have fair background in
statistics, knowledge of molecular methods and she/he
is preferrably expected to have experience in analyses
of next-generation sequence data. Parasitological back-
ground is advantageous. Previous experience with ape
or non-human primate research is not needed. We ex-
pect strong motivation and commitment, willingness to
quickly learn new methods, analytical thinking, good
communication skills and ability for both independent
and team-work. The successful candidate will partici-
pate in a PhD program at Masaryk University in Brno
(parasitology). The starting date is fall 2018.
Important note: this is not a PhD with a strong eld
component, most of the work is focused on laboratory
and data analyses.
If interested, please, send (1) CV including a list of publi-
cations, (2) motivation letter, and (3) contact details for
2 references to Klara Petrzelkova (petrzelkova@ivb.cz)
immediately, latest mid-May.

CIRAD Montpellier
EvolutionViruses
We have a PhD position available, starting no later
than September 2018, at CIRAD, research unit ASTRE,
Montpellier, France.
The PhD student will work on the virulence of Peste
des petits Ruminants Virus in relation to variability of
host response.
Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) is highly
pathogenic to small ruminants (e.g. goats, sheep), but
susceptibility of hosts vary widely among viral strains
and host breeds. This project focuses on host-pathogen
interactions, and more specically the modulation of
host immune response, during infection of small rumi-
nants by PPRV, and how these interactions can explain
variability in pathogen virulence and host susceptibil-
ity. The project will combine in vitro and in vivo ap-
proaches. Virus infection and replication will be studied,and critical genes products and their networks involved
in resistance to PRRV will be identied using a system
immunology approach.
This project will benet from a close collaboration be-
tween the research unit ASTRE of Cirad (Montpellier,
France) and the Institute of Virology and Immunology
(Berne, Switzerland). The PhD student will be mainly
based in Montpellier (France), but will stay in Berne
for several months for training and to carry out some of
the *in vitro* and all the *in vivo *experiments under
the supervision of Dr Artur Summereld.
We are looking for a highly motivated student interested
in virology and immunology. Previous experience in
these elds is an advantage. The student has to be will-
ing to work in high connement facilities. The student
will be based in Montpellier, but will stay at least once
for several months in Berne, Switzerland. Knowledge
of French is not necessary but may help in everyday
life. Active knowledge of written and spoken English is
needed.
Please contact us for more details about the thesis
project and necessary documents for the application.
Candidates must send a PDF document including* their
CV and grade sheets and rank* (rank/total number of
students) *from their Master*'s degree*.*

expanded to include other spiralians. The molecular
mechanisms underlying annelid and spiralian develop-
ment are not well understood and multiple features
including the spiral cleavage program make spiralians
a great group of animals to study evolution of animal
body plans. Furthermore, the research community that
studies evolution of spiralian body plans is small but
rapidly growing and is very welcoming and collaborative.
Potential research topics in our lab include investiga-May 1, 2018 EvolDir 13

TardigradeEvolution
*PhD studentship in tardigrade evolution*
Fully funded 4-year PhD studentship in tardigrade evo-
lution at the Jagiellonian University in Krak ow (Poland)
in the team of Dr. ukasz Michalczyk.
The main goal of the project is to test how reproductive
mode and cryptobiotic abilities aect dispersal and, in
consequence, speciation and extinction rates in tardi-
grades. Tardigrades are a phylum of microinvertebrates
that dwell a wide variety of habitats throughout the
globe. They are famous for their cryptobiotic abilities
that allow them to withstand extreme conditions and
are also thought to aid dispersal of individual species.
Moreover, tardigrades exhibit a range of reproductive
modes, including dioecy and parthenogenesis. Theory
predicts that both asexual reproduction and cryptobi-
otic survival should increase dispersal potential. On
the other hand, dierences in dispersal abilities are hy-
pothesised to aect speciation and lineage extinction
rates. Thus, tardigrades are an interesting model to
address some of the fundamental questions of modern
evolutionary biology, biogeography and taxonomy such
as mechanism underlying the evolution of biodiversity
or evolution of sex.
The successful candidate will be involved in eldwork
(sample collection), sample extraction, slide prepara-
tion, morphometrics and imaging in light microscope,
processing specimens for scanning electron microscope,
karyotyping, DNA extraction, amplication and mul-
tilocus sequencing (NGS), species identication, and
taking care of tardigrade cultures. The student will also
analyse data and prepare drafts of manuscripts, and will
be involved in the promotion of results at seminars and
conferences.The PhD programme in Biology at the Jagiellonian
University is run entirely in English and includes some
obligatory and facultative classes. The programme is
open to all nationalities and there are no tuition fees.
Depending on the achievements and performance of the
successful candidate, the tax-free monthly stipend will
vary from 4 000 to 7 000 PLN (typically, cost of life in
Krak ow for a PhD student is ca. 2 500 PLN).
Deadline for applications: 20th May 2018.

LaReunion CropPathogenEvolution
As part of a collaboration between CIRAD (La R eunion
& Montpellier) and the National Museum of Natural
History (MNHN Paris), we are looking for a motivated
and talented PhD student to work on the following
topic: Improving our understanding of crop pathogen
evolution and emergence using ancient DNA .
In order to better control current diseases of plants
and prevent future epidemics, it is crucial to develop
an improved understanding of the factors underlying
pathogen emergence, adaptation and spread. Recent
developments in DNA sequencing technology now en-
able the recovery of historical genomes dating back to
previous centuries. The aim of this PhD is to recon-
struct the history and evolution of some of the current
most devastating crop pathogenic bacteria using his-
torical genomes issued from herbaria collections. The
major novelty of this project lies in the reconstruction
of complete genomes from herbarium dried plant speci-
mens as well as in their analyses with sophisticated and
dedicated population genetics methods. This project is
expected to lead to major advances in molecular epi-
demiology of plant infectious diseases, through both

LundU 2 EcoImmuneCosts
PhD position advertised in the ERC Advanced Grant
Project 'EcoImmuneCosts' (PI: Dennis Hasselquist),
Lund University (Sweden):
Mild disease, immune function and aging: the role of
telomere length and degradation
Requirement prole Connections between (mild) disease,
the immune system and aging has become a hot topic
in evolutionary biology and ecology in recent years. In
the present project, the main aim is to investigate rela-
tionships between mild disease, immune responses and
aging/aging markers and how these three factors are
associated with reproductive and life history strategies
in studies on birds, with special emphasis on telomeres,
and with the great reed warbler as model species. Main
focus will be on; (i) long-term studies ( >30 years) of a
natural, wild population of great reed warblers (Acro-
cephalus arundinaceus) at lake Kvismaren SSE Orebro,
in southern Central Sweden, and (ii) a long-term malariainfection experiment on great reed warblers in Bulgaria.
Project description The PhD candidate will analyze
longitudinal data on early life telomere length (eTL)
to investigate whether, for example, eTL is predictive
of malaria infection and/or whether eTL is associated
with recovery from illness, as well as how disease recov-
ered versus chronically infected birds dier with respect
to telomere shortening, aging and reproductive perfor-
mance. The project also aims at looking at the dierent
life history strategies of great reed warblers (e.g., pace-
of-life hypothesis). Furthermore, the project aims to
study sex dierences in long-term eects (immune re-
sponses, (Mhc) gene expression, physiological health)
of experimentally infected great reed warblers which
will be kept in aviaries. The project involves extensive
eld work with great reed warblers in lake Kvismaren,
N~A^Arke, which is part of the ongoing long-term pop-
ulation study. The PhD candidate is also expected
to carry out a substantial amount of laboratory work,
particularly qPCR analyses of telomere length and in-
fection analyses (malaria and other microorganisms).
He/she will analyse long-term data that previously have
been collected (DNA samples, reproductive performance
and Darwinian tness data etc) and own data collected
during the PhD studies.
Required Qualications - Master degree in biology,
with specializations in animal ecology, evolution-
ary/behavioural ecology and molecular ecology. - High
motivation and a sincere interest in this particular
project is crucial. - It is highly desired that the ap-
plicant has considerable experience of analysing DNA
data, in particular telomere length and malaria parasite
analyses. - Laboratory experience from molecular tech-
niques (in particular qPCR, but also PCR and Sanger
sequencing) is desirable - Analytic skills and an interest
in analysing life history and tness data in combination
with DNA data are requested. - It is a requirement that
spoken and written English is excellent. - Experience
from eldwork with birds is very important, and ex-
perience of eld work on great reed warblers an extra
plus.

Project 'EcoImmuneCosts' (PI: Dennis Hasselquist),
Lund University (Sweden):
Telomere length, immune responses and immune costs
Requirement prole Eco-immunology targets one of
the great challenges in biology and medicine - how
the immune system has evolved to optimize protection
and minimize immunopathology (incl. autoimmune)
costs. Recent research suggests that seemingly harmless
pathogens and short-term episodes of immune system
activation entail delayed ('hidden') tness costs. How-
ever, the mechanisms mediating these costs are still
unknown. The project thus aims to explore these mech-
anisms and a major target is to experimentally test if
accelerated telomere degradation is a causative mecha-
nism through which small immune costs can accumulate
and be translated

The 'Adaptation, Integration, Recticulation, Evolution'
team at Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France is searching
for the right candidate for either the following PhD
topic|: Networks approaches to characterize novel mi-
crobial lineages and divergent defense/communication
mechanisms from metagenomes of extreme environ-
ments. OR the following PhD topic|: Networks ap-
proaches to characterize divergent microbial lineages
and novel genes encoding primary metabolisms from
metagenomes of extreme environments. | There are
good chances (circa 40%) that one of these grants will
be funded, but the candidate will have to pass an au-
dition in late May/early June to ensure this. | There
will be in fact two separate auditions since each project
(one focusing on communication mechanisms/ the other
focusing on primary metabolisms) has been preselected
in a separate instance.
Supervisors for this project will be Philippe Lopez and
Eric Bapteste, and the rst project will also be co-
supervised by Yanyan Li (Museum National d'Histoire
Naturelle, Paris, France). If interested, please send a
mail to philippe.lopez@upmc.fr.
A brief summary of the rst project can be found below|
:
Our knowledge on the evolution of important gene fami-
lies has so far largely relied on the comparative analysis
of sequences from cultured microbial organisms, which
represent a minor fraction of Life on Earth. However,
the growing amount of molecular data from environmen-
tal samples or single cells is now providing important
additional data to test whether genetic diversity in envi-
ronmental sequences is signicantly larger than genetic
diversity in the gene families of cultured organisms.
This project aims at nding very divergent homologs of
proteins of interest (see below) in environmental data.
The Lopez/Bapteste lab owns unique metagenomic
datasets from under-explored extreme environments
(Dallol, Lake Tirez, Lost Hammer), as well as the cor-
responding samples collected and stored. This lab also
masters sequence similarity network methods, that allowMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 21
to analyze metagenomic and genomic data and to inves-
tigate highly divergent gene forms and relationships of
distant homology. These graphs allow for mathematical
analyses of genetic diversity over dozens of millions of
sequences, providing a powerful framework to address
the evolution of divergent genes and genomes.
The Li/Bourguet-Kondracki lab is specialized in the
functional studies of molecular mechanisms involved in
the microbial communication, defense and adaptation
to the environment, using multi-disciplinary approaches
(biochemistry, microbiology). This team will provide
expertise in guiding the selection of genes involved in
microbial communication and defense to study and will
provide experimental validation of newly-identied gene
families identied by bioinformatics.
This project, at the interface of bioinformatics, evolution-
ary microbiology/ecology and biochemistry will mine
publicly available and original environmental datasets
to:
- identify new forms of microbial defense and communi-
cations genes, e.g.| those involved in quorum sensing,
two-component systems as well as antibiotic production
and resistance genes.
- identify new lineages hosting these genes, with a par-
ticular focus on microbes belonging to still undetected
deep-branching microbial lineages|
- sequence these new lineages through design of original
primers and single cell genomic studies.||

1. Speciation, species boundaries and hybridization in
the Ameerega bassleri complex: insights from natural
history, acoustic and morphological data, geospatial
data, sub-genomic and paleoclimatology. This group is
a highly diverse group of three species with dramatic
phenotypic variation across its range. It also has experi-
enced several historical hybridization events among the
taxa that have muddled and complicated their evolution-
ary histories. This research will be aimed to understand
factor driving and maintaining speciation in natural
situations.
1. Phylogeography and spatial biodiversity patterns
of the poison frog genus Ranitomeya: insights from
sub-genomic data, geospatial analysis and phylogenet-
ics. The thumbnail poison frogs are some of the most
amazing species on earth| half the taxa are involved
in Mullerian mimicry, they exhibit intensive parental,
and they often display incredible phenotypic variation
among populations... This group in an endless fountain
of evolutionary questions.
1. The genetic consequences of future climate change:
spatially explicit predictions of within-species genetic
diversity using climatic, demographic, and genetic data.
This research will expand upon a lab methodology that
accounts for climatic, geographic, and biological com-
plexity. This framework is promising for understanding
evolutionary consequences of climate change and guiding
conservation planning.

Project description
The Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sci-
ences invites applications for a four-year PhD position
as part of a project on The relationship between climate,
disease and coee yield: Optimizing management for
smallholder farmers.
High-prole studies have warned for the threat of climate
change and fungal disease on world coee production
at a global scale. However, few studies have targeted
the opportunities and challenges of smallholder coee
farmers to face such changes. For this we need detailed
insights on the link between climate, disease and yield,
and how the farmers can improve their livelihood by
optimal management. This project focuses on the link
between climate, diseases, management and the liveli-
hood of smallholder farmers in southwestern Ethiopia.
Within the study area, coee is grown in the shade of
natural trees, and the farmer therefore has the unique
opportunity to inuence the link between the macro-
climate and the microclimate by managing the shade
cover.
The overarching aim of the PhD project is to under-
stand the relationship between management, macro- and
microclimate, disease levels, and yield, and use these
insights to optimize management decisions by small-
holder farmers. The project is strongly interdisciplinary,
including climate modelling, farmer interviews, eld sur-veys and eld experiments. More specically, we aim
to: i) use dataloggers to model the spatial and temporal
variation in the macro- and microclimate, and explore
future climate scenarios under dierent carbon-emission
levels, ii) use eld surveys to link climatic variation and
management to disease levels and coee yield, iii) con-
duct a questionnaire to understand the decision-making
process by the farmer, which may be inuenced by ob-
servations of past and present yield, disease levels, the
macro- and microclimate and perceived ecosystem ser-
vices, and iv) use a manipulative eld experiment using
shading and irrigation to validate the eectiveness of
adaptive management.

Tahiti OysterGenomicSelection
Graduate position: PhD - Exploration of the poten-
tial of genomic selection in the black-lip pearl oyster,
Pinctada margaritifera
WHERE: Centre Ifremer du pacique, BP 49, 98719
Taravao, Tahiti, Polyn esie Fran caise.
WHAT: Graduate Position (PhD)
Scientic context: Within French Polynesia, the aqua-
culture of the silver-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada margar-
itifera, is dedicated to the production of the highly
valued Tahitian pearl. The culture of these Tahitian
pearls represents the second most valuable economic re-
source for French Polynesia after tourism. Today, there
are 536 producers in 26 islands and atolls covering a to-
tal operating sea area of 7800 hectares. The production
of cultured pearls is carried out through a transplant
involving two genomes: one from a donor oyster, and
one from a recipient oyster. During this process, the
donor oyster is sacriced for a portion of its mantle
tissue. This piece of mantle tissue is then inserted into
the gonads of a recipient oyster along with a spherical
nucleus. The cells from the grafted tissue then form a
mineralizing pearl sac in which after 15 to 22 months of
culture, a pearl will be produced through the depositionMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 23
of successive layers of aragonite around the nucleus. At
harvest, the quality of the pearl is dened by a range
of characters including: 1) its weight / diameter, 2) its
surface defects (number of blemishes and imperfections),
3) its luster (dull or highly lustrous), 4) its commercial
grading (A, B, C, D or reject), 5) its color components
(hue, saturation and darkness), and 6) its shape. The
quality of a pearl is conditioned by a very complex set of
intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors.
Recent studies have conrmed the roles played by the
donor oysters graft in determining the color of the pearls,
as well as the eect the recipient oyster has on pearl
size (Blay et al., 2017, Ky et al., 2017). Genomic selec-
tion for P. margaritifera in French Polynesia is still in
its infancy. The general ease of accessing the abundant
wild mother-of-pearl resources in the Polynesian lagoons
(Lemer et al., 2011, Lemer and Planes, 2012) has in-
directly hindered the development of hatcheries which
are an integral part of developing a genetic selection
program. However, pearling is having an environmental
impact by reducing the abundance of this natural re-
source. This coupled with the overproduction of pearls
and the subsequent reduction in their quality, has raised
awareness of the need for sustainable management of
pearl production. Furthermore, the identication and
analysis of the expression of biomineralization genes
associated with the growth and quality of the pearls
produced (Joubert et al., 2010; Joubert, 2011), provides
a panel of target genes that may inuence the quality
of pearls. These molecular tools can oer indications
of adaptive processes involved in biotic and abiotic in-
teractions and their impact on the industry (Joubert et
al., 2014). Although these standard \candidate gene"
approaches have shown a genetic basis leading to the
formation of the pearl, they have not been able to pro-
vide an answer from the point of view of the selection
of lines and the potential \trade o" associated with
them. With genome assembly and ongoing transcrip-
tome analyzes in progress, the thesis project aims to
provide practical and theoretical tools for the genomic
selection of the black-lip pearl oyster. This will be con-
ducted in partnership with SCA Regahiga (Gambier
archipelago), the rst French Polynesian pearling com-
pany with a hatchery, DRMM and CRIOBE (CNRS
/ EPHE). More specically, the objectives of the the-
sis are: 1. To estimate the level of inter- and intra-
family genetic dierentiation using SNPs markers (the
SNPs panel will be developed as part of the AmeliGEN
project). Automated batch genotyping will allow the
optimization of crosses to maintain the genetic diver-
sity and identify families. 2. To lay the foundations
necessary for the establishment of a genetic selection pro-
gram for the black-lip pearl oyster within an operational
hatchery. This will be done through the comparativeanalysis of grafts made from individuals originating from
natural populations (wild S), rst (G1), or second (G2)
generations. These comparisons will make it possible
to estimate the potential for genetic progress and to
evaluate the non-genetic components involved in the
transmission of the \pearl" phenotype. This component
will also assess the importance of genotype-environment
interactions. 3. To identify and study the expression of
the key biomineralization genes involved in the growth
potential of pearl oysters and their associated pearl
phenotype. This will be conducted through the tran-
scriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of experimental batches
of pearl oysters.

PhD position in Ecological Genomics
Motivated students of plant evolution are invited to
apply for a PhD position within our projects on the
ecological genomics of duplicated genes.
Responsibilities This research will extend our under-
standing of plant adaptation and speciation across natu-24 EvolDir May 1, 2018
ral landscapes. It will contribute to answering fundamen-
tal questions in evolutionary biology such as: What are
the main molecular drivers of genome evolution? How
do ecological constraints shape genomes? What is the
signicance of whole-genome duplication for biodiver-
sity? The PhD project will experimentally address the
phenotypic and transcriptional plasticity in populations
of Buckler Mustard from dierent environments. In
particular, the candidate will generate high-throughput
sequence data from experimental populations of diploid
and polyploid lineages and assess the impact of dupli-
cated genes along with environmental changes on adap-
tation to contrasted ecological niches. In collaboration
with a postdoc focused on the molecular underpinnings
of genome dynamics, the candidate will disentangle the
contributions of genomic and environmental factors in
driving radiation in the Alps.
Requirements The project necessitates to proactively
deal with multiple tasks going from eld work to in
silico analyses. The ideal candidate will thus be well
organized and creative, collaborative and used to han-
dle large datasets towards integrated results. A solid

of sperm competition. This will allow us to understand
how individual variation in sexual competition generates
individual variation, and covariation, in both compet-
itive traits and parenting behaviour. The successful
candidate will closely work together with another PhD
student to (i) quantify male social niche conformance
by analysing adjustment of sexual competitiveness in-
cluding behavioural (e.g. aggression) and ejaculate (e.g.
sperm motility) traits; (ii) identify the underlying mech-
anisms of social niche conformance on the hormonal (via
endocrinological proling) and the gene expression (via
RNAseq) levels; (iii) assess the adaptive signicance
of niche conformance under a niche match/mismatch
paradigm; and (iv) test for trade-os between invest-
ment in sexual competitiveness versus paternal care. A
sub-project A will primarily focus on male social niche
conformance through adjustment of behavioural traits
and the hormonal mechanisms underlying niche confor-
mance. A sub-project B will primarily focus on male

Taking the heat: how do parent birds mitigate costs of
breeding at high temperatures?
MSc/PhD research at the FitzPatrick Institute of
African Ornithology, Department of Biological Sciences,
University of Cape Town
We invite applications for the above full-time re-
search scholarship at the FitzPatrick Institute, a world-
renowned, national Centre of Excellence (CoE) in or-
nithological research with a strong emphasis on post-
graduate studies. The successful applicant will focus
on understanding whether & how Fork-tailed Drongos
Dicrurus adsimilis balance trade-os between parental
care and thermoregulation in order to maintain repro-
ductive output in the face of harsh thermal conditions
in the Kalahari Desert. The candidate will be supported
and supervised by Dr Susie Cunningham and Dr Tom
Flower, and will work under the aegis of the Hot Birds
Research Project and the Fork-tailed Drongo Project.
Fork-tailed Drongos are pair-breeding passerines that
nest during the hottest time of year in the Kalahari
Desert, when air temperatures regularly approach or
exceed 40 ^A^A. Preliminary data suggest adult dron-
gos struggle to balance thermoregulatory, foraging and
parental demands at high air temperatures; yet nestlings
maintain growth rates even on hot days, suggesting par-
ents may somehow buer them from these costs. Major
lines of investigation for this study include: how adultsMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 27
alter provisioning behaviour with temperature; whether
they can compensate for reduced provisioning during hot
periods; how they regulate their own and ospring' ^As
body temperature; whether costs to ospring manifest
in ways other than reduced mass gain. The project
sits at the intersection of the elds of behavioural ecol-
ogy and ecophysiology, drawing on behavioural ecology
theory (including central place foraging theory and the
economics of balancing energy and water budgets); and
principles of thermal biology. The drongo population
at the study site (Kuruman River Reserve) is fully ha-
bituated, facilitating an experimental approach. The
project is oered as an MSc with scope to be upgraded
to a PhD depending on the interests and progress of the
successful candidate. Under exceptional circumstances,
we will also consider applications from candidates al-
ready holding an MSc who would like to undertake the
project as a PhD.
Candidates should have an appropriate BSc Hon-
ours/MSc degree with excellent records. Field expe-
rience involving data collection is essential as the candi-
date will be required to often organize and conduct eld
work independently. As drongos nest high in camelthorn
trees it is important to have a good head for heights.
Experience in statistical data analysis and writing skills
would be favoured to ensure an ecient start. The suc-
cessful candidate will form part of an established and
supportive research team.
The value of the scholarship is R95 000/R125 000 per
year for up to two years for MSc/for up to three years
for PhD. Renewal each year will be contingent on satis-
factory academic progress. Adequate project running
costs are available.

record & names and contact details of two referees)

\Causes and consequences of mutational variation in
the mammalian genome"
Supervisors Prof Peter Keightley and Dr Konrad Lohse,
University of Edinburgh, UK.
Spontaneous mutations are the ultimate source of ge-
netic variation and are therefore central in evolutionary
genetics. For example, spontaneous mutation is funda-
mental for understanding the genetic basis of quantita-
tive variation, the threat posed by declining population
size in conservation biology and the distribution of nu-
cleotide variation in the genome. We are recruiting a
PhD student to join our team attempting to address
these and other unanswered questions. We work exten-
sively on the house mouse as a model system, but our
research is not restricted to this species.
The PhD will be part of an ERC Advanced Grant enti-
tled \An integrated approach to understanding the im-
pact of de novo mutations on the mammalian genome",
a key component of which is to carry out the rst large-
scale mutation accumulation (MA) experiment in a
mammalian species (the house mouse). Such an ex-
periment consists of maintaining independent MA lines,
bred by full-sib mating, for many generations in the
near-absence of selection. Dierent lines will accumu-
late dierent mutations and diverge at the molecular
and phenotypic levels. The PhD project is expected
to be within some or all of the areas described below.
However, the project is exible and can be tailored to
the interest of the applicant.| Applicants are strongly
encouraged to contact the supervisors ahead of applica-
tion to discuss the project.| 1. The nature of variation
from new mutation (a) Theoretically, inbred lines should
harbour little genetic variation. At mutation-drift bal-
ance, expected nucleotide variation is the product of
the mutation rate per base pair and the eective pop-
ulation size (Ne = 4 for full-sib mating). There are,
however, several factors which could lead to inbred lines
harbouring more variation than expected.| We will test
this by quantifying nucleotide variation in the inbred
MA line progenitors by deep genome sequencing and
bioinformatic analysis.
(b) The extent and nature of variation in the mutation
rate have been little studied. We will address these ques-
tions by large-scale deep sequencing and bioinformatic28 EvolDir May 1, 2018
analysis of house mouse MA lines of dierent strains
and potentially families of wild house mice.
(c) The relationship between nucleotide and phenotypic
variation arising from mutation are largely unknown.
Phenotypic divergence between MA lines quanties the
new mutational variation. We will relate the accumula-
tion of phenotypic dierences among lines to dierences
in the accumulation of mutations in dierent genomic
site classes.
2. Understanding variation in diversity across the
genome.
Genetic diversity varies across the genome, but the
causes of this variation are poorly understood. It is
clear that variation in diversity is caused by interactions
between mutation, natural selection, recombination and
genetic drift. We will explore avenues of research that
might help tease apart these factors. (a) Are patterns
of diversity across the genome consistent between dif-
ferent species with dierent population sizes? It will be
especially relevant to determine how diversity relates
to the rate of recombination and the local density of
functional genomic elements. (b) Are there signals in
genomic polymorphism data, for example in the joint
frequency distribution of linked sites that can dier-
entiate between dierent forms of selection? We will
explore how new analytic results under coalescent ap-
proximations to selection can help to better quantify
genome-wide selection.

EnvironmentalMetabarcoding
A fully funded 3.5 year PhD studentship is available with
the Rivers and Lochs Institute (RLI) and the Scottish
Association for Marine Science (SAMS) at the University
of the Highlands and Islands.
Project description
The farming of sh is expanding rapidly in order to
meet the ever increasing demand for food by a rapidly
growing human population. The FAO estimates that the
world population will grow from 7.5 billion to 9.7 billion
by 2050 and currently aquaculture supplies more than
50% of all sh for human consumption. Salmon farming
is a massive industry with major production centres in
Norway, Chile, UK and Canada. In Scotland, it con-
stitutes the largest food-based export market, worth
pounds 500 million per year and this is set to double by
2030. Salmon farming operations must demonstrate, to
the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA),
compliance with environmental standards around their
operations. Currently, environmental monitoring is ex-
pensive and time-consuming and not conducive to opti-
mising a site's potential. Whilst most Scottish salmon
aquaculture is marine-based, a signicant proportion
occurs in freshwater lochs where the impacts are poorly
understood. There is not a common approach to moni-
toring across the two aquatic environments.
Salmon farming impacts the seabed below and around
the farm where farm-derived organic waste accumulates.
The current method of assessing impact is by inter-
preting patterns in the spatial distribution of benthic
assemblages of organisms using traditional morphology-
based identication. This is expensive, time consuming
and relies on a dwindling number of taxonomic experts.
Often by the time the assessment is complete, sh in
the cages have been harvested, resulting in an inability
to implement immediate change in response to any en-
vironmental impact. This morphology-based approach
is implemented for marine sh cages, with no equivalent
assessment for freshwater aquaculture that occurs in
Scotland. Similar monitoring in freshwater could help
the industry by demonstrating environmental steward-
ship across both habitat types, realise production po-
tential, maintain environmental standards, and reduce
the costs for regulatory compliance, thereby allowing30 EvolDir May 1, 2018
the industry to grow responsibly.
Recent innovations mean that it is possible to assess
entire biological assemblages by extracting DNA from
environmental samples (e.g. from sediments) and identi-
fying the source organisms, using high-throughput next
generation DNA sequencing in an approach referred to
DNA metabarcoding. Metabarcoding can complement
and potentially overcome limitations of morphologically-
based methods by targeting dierent species, sampling
greater diversity and increasing taxonomic resolution.
The use of DNA metabarcoding is rapidly expanding,
however questions still remain on the spatial and tem-
poral scales of inference compared to other methods in
addition to issues around data interpretation.
This studentship will extend an ongoing UHI-industry-
SEPA project by developing and comparing the use of
this technology at both marine and freshwater farming
operations by addressing the following questions: (i)
what is the inuence of sh farms on the taxonomic
diversity of marine and freshwater benthic assemblages?
(ii) which (if any) organisms can be used as indicators of
environmental impact and (iii) how does the biological
assemblage change over the farm production cycle and
how can this be used to predict regulatory compliance?
Location and Supervisory Team
The student will be based in the Rivers and Lochs In-
stitute at the new Inverness Campus as part of a team
of researchers focusing on aquatic biodiversity, conser-
vation and management with Dr Mark Coulson (Rivers
and Lochs Institute, Inverness College UHI) as Director
of Studies. Dr. Coulson has 15 years of experience
in molecular ecology and applied population genetics,
sheries management and environmental DNA (eDNA).
He helped to establish a state-of-the-art molecular ge-
nomics facility encompassing NextGen sequencing sys-
tems, qPCR, and other high throughput DNA fragment
analysis instrumentation.
The PhD will be co-supervised by Tom Wilding (SAMS,
Nr Oban, Scotland). Dr Wilding has 20 years of impact
monitoring, experimental design and statistical mod-
elling experience. Dr Wilding will provide 'aquaculture-
industry' context to the project, provide guidance on
experimental design, sampling methodology, bioinfor-
matics and statistical modelling. The student will have
opportunities to join boat-based marine sampling con-
ducted by SAMS. A third supervisor from SEPA will
also be appointed to provide regulatory context to the
PhD.
This PhD oers the successful candidate the oppor-
tunity to join a team of experienced, dynamic re-
searchers that are developing revolutionary methodolo-gies for ecosystem-monitoring applicable to any environ-
ment. The student will gain experience in eld-sampling,

The adaptive signicance of sleep: Testing the immune
theory in a natural primate population.
Abstract
The adaptive signicance of sleep: Testing the immune
theory in a natural primate population.
Abstract
The functional signicance and the physiological mech-
anisms of sleep remain unsolved. A largely untested
assumption is that sleep evolved to sustain immune de-
fences and protect against diseases. We propose to study
the mechanistic and functional relationships between
sleep and the immune system using long-term individ-
ual monitoring of nonhuman primates in combination
with eld experiments and laboratory analyses. In par-
ticular, we propose to identify i) the dierent factors
causing sleep variation within and across individuals;
ii) the mechanistic, physiological and immunological
pathways that relate sleep to immunity and conversely;
and iii) the short- and long-term consequences of bothchronic and acute lack of sleep on animal physiology,
behaviour and tness. We propose to attain these three
objectives in two populations of mandrills ( Mandrillus
sphinx ) showing contrasted lifestyles and dierent con-
straints acting on individual sleep. In particular, we
will perform a ne-grained description of sleep architec-
ture and quality in the two studied populations. We
will study how and why sleep naturally varies across
individuals under normal vs. altered conditions (natu-
ral vs. captive populations) and how it changes when
individuals face both parasite challenges (considering a
large range of parasites) and experimental disruptions
of their sleep (through deparasitation events). Addi-
tionally, we will study the physiological consequences of
normal vs. experimentally-disrupted sleep on cytokine
production. Finally, sleep variation in normal vs. in
altered conditions will be related to individual health
and tness thanks to long-term monitoring of the two
populations.
Candidate desired prole
Biologgers will be equipped on 90 individuals for a full
year generating billions of data (acceleration, tempera-
tures). We are therefore looking for a highly motivated
PhD student with a strong experience and background in
bio-informatics. The student will manage the database
associated to the project and will take care of the data
generated by the biologgers. Strong competencies in
statistics are also mandatory. Candidates with no experi-
ence in bio-informatics will not be considered. Fieldwork
in Gabon is not planned within the framework of this
PhD project.

e.g. active and binding sites or functional domains.
However, within proteins, regions of intrinsically dis-
order occur and these are characterized by a lack of
a well-dened three-dimensional structure. Although
these disordered regions do not show a particular higher
conformational state, they are known to be functionallyMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 35
important, such as through their involvement in protein-
protein interactions or DNA/RNA binding. In a recent
work we have shown that there is ongoing positive se-
lection that contributes substantially to the evolution
of human long intrinsically disordered protein regions.
Furthermore, these protein regions are enriched in post-
translational modication sites as well as regions and
motifs (annotated sequence stretches of biological impor-
tance), but surprisingly disease mutations tend to occur
much less frequently in disordered regions (Uversky et
al., 2014), with the exception of mutations associated
with musculoskeletal diseases.
This timely project aims to understand why disease
mutations tend to be less frequent in disordered protein
regions. The focus of this project will lie on the excep-
tional group of mutations involved in musculoskeletal
diseases that are enriched in disordered protein regions
by comparing them to those involved in other disease
groups. Fundamental will be a novel genomic compar-
ative approach currently developed in the Gossmann
lab targeted at the identication of the evolutionary
properties of disease-associated sites. Furthermore, in
collaboration with Daniel Rigden from the University
of Liverpool, we will conduct molecular dynamic sim-
ulations to investigate three dimensional features of
disease associated mutations on protein exibility and
protein-ligand interactions. Furthermore we will exploit
machine learning approaches to predict protein disorder
on the single site residue eects. Experimental evidence
and the underlying mechanistics of disease candidate
sites can then functionally be tested in a y model in
collaboration with the Mirre Simons lab at the Univer-
sity of Sheeld. This will ultimately gain insights into
whether disease mutations are genuinely less likely to oc-
cur in disordered protein regions or whether our lacking
understanding of disease properties associated with dis-
ordered protein regions has led to an under-annotation
in the respective databases.
For this highly innovative, collaborative and interdis-
ciplinary PhD the respective candidate should have a
strong background in biology, molecular biology and
genetics as well basic programming knowledge or at
least a strong interest in computational approaches to
investigate fundamental biological problems. A back-
ground in bioinformatics is of advantage, however all
necessary approaches will be taught during the duration
of the PhD. This project will take advantage of multiple
biological \big" data sets, such as the 1000-Genome
project, Uniprot, large-scale mammalian phylogenies
and their respective whole genome information, as well
as PDB and several secondary databases.

USheeld ScienceInformationBias
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic
PhD student to work on information bias in modern life
sciences.
Deadline: Monday, May 14, 2018
Enquiries and application: https://www.ndaphd.com/-
search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=97183 Project De-
scription
Modern life sciences are increasingly driven
by next-generation sequencing and whole
genome/transcriptome/proteome/metabolome wide-
association studies. Such 'modern life science' associates
large-scale datasets with phenotypes or diseases of
interest to discover their underlying biology to be
used in medicine. With such discovery-based science
a lot of progress can be made, however, there is
a large dependency for interpretation on currently
known information. This information bias generates
self-fullling prophecies, biased research directions and
interpretations. We know that the level of information
is heavily biased - for example, because, certain genes,
diseases or species have been hotspots of research
(https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07291-9).
Even worse, such study bias reinforces information
bias further and it is often unclear what the reliability
of the initial information was in the rst place. Here
we propose a statistical approach that incorporates36 EvolDir May 1, 2018
information bias in both quantity and quality to
objectively distil biology of interest and to ag up
important currently unknown biology.
The techniques used to achieve this will involve ma-
chine learning (principle component and cluster analy-
sis), evolutionary genomics, data imputation and reli-
ability weighting (as in meta-analysis). Moreover, the
student will help generate a user-friendly GUI for the
community. For proof of principle we will utilise one
database, Flybase (Drosophila melanogaster), that is
very well annotated and has the largest quantity of in
depth information not available for other organisms.
The methods generated will however be applicable to
any database, including human databases. In addition,
the use of ies will allow the student to put the soft-
ware generated to the test using two large experimental
datasets that we have generated in my lab: experimen-
tal GWAS in ies for longevity and neurodegenerative
disease. Candidate genes identied by the student can
subsequently be tested for causality using functional
genetics of ies.
Modern life science generates a tremendous amount of
data that is close to incomprehensible except to study
the top associations with the outcome (e.g. disease) of
interest. Currently such top associations, or 'hits', are
compared to a database of current knowledge on the
gene level. Such data mining can be rewarding, but also
imposes strong information bias. The beauty of modern
life science is that it has the potential to be unbiased and
can be highly informative about mechanisms, especially
in disease or for complex phenotypes such as ageing.
The project we propose is therefore exceptionally timely.
Biological interpretation from large scale, often costly,
studies that are currently generated is impeded by our
current inability to assess current knowledge objectively,
intuitively and in an integrated fashion.
We seek a hard-working passionate student with a quan-
titative mind-set and an interest in the biology of disease
and ageing. Several educational backgrounds are suit-
able for this project and include, but are not exclusive,
to bioinformatics, computational science and biomed-
ical science. The techniques that are listed can all be
learned within the PhD and no prior experience with
these is essential. The broad scientic expertise and
commitment of the supervisors ensures ample support
and a vibrant environment for the student.

GENETIC MAPPING IN MOUSE INTERSPECIFIC
HYBRIDS USING IN VITRO CROSSES
Friedrich Miescher Laboratory, Max Planck Campus,
T ubingen, Germany
One postdoctoral position and one sta scientist position
(both for 2 years in the rst instance) are available in
the Chan Lab at the Max Planck Institute in T ubingen
as part of a prestigious 1.5M EUR European Research
Council grant investigating the role of gene regulatory
network evolution in mice by studying \in vitro" genetic
crosses.
The goal of our research is to adopt cutting-edge tissue
culture techniques for studying evolutionary divergence
in gene networks. We have developed a system to use
mitotic recombination, as opposed to meiotic recombi-
nation through breeding, to generate genetic diversity
in F1 interspecic hybrid mouse ES cells under tissue
culture conditions (Lazzarano et al., PNAS, 2018). This
allows us to create recombinant cell lines of eectively
unlimited size at low costs within a matter of weeks.
We now aim to use these \in vitro recombinant" panelsMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 41
to obtain phenotypic measurements via tissue engineer-
ing, organ-on-a-chip or droplet microuidic single-cell
methods.
We're looking for highly motivated individuals for the
following roles:
1) Postdoc: You should be about to earn, or have re-
cently earned your PhD in the areas of genetics, molecu-
lar biology or regenerative medicine. You should demon-
strate expertise in tissue culture techniques. You should
be able to demonstrate promise in early career success
in a rst author publication or preprint ready for sub-
mission. A background in genetic mapping or GWAS
will be advantageous. A background in evolutionary
biology will be helpful, but not a requirement. We are
interested in candidates who are keen to apply and de-
velop new genetic tools and technologies. Passion for
research, team spirit and enthusiasm are essential.
2) Sta scientist: You should hold a Bachelors-equivalent
degree or higher qualications in the areas of genetics,
molecular biology or regenerative medicine. We are
looking for a strong track-record and demonstrated re-
search experience and training, particularly in tissue
culture and aseptic techniques. You will be a central
team member assigned to work closely with a postdoc
in carrying out work mainly using tissue culture, tis-
sue engineering and microuidics techniques. We will
provide training on advanced tissue engineering tech-
niques and microuidics device fabrication, including
but not limited to ow or microuidics models to assay
expression and tissue phenotypes. You will also operate
ow cytometry instrument(s) in the context of tissue
dierentiation and single-cell studies. You will assist in
generating DNA and RNAseq libraries to help dissect
the genetic architecture of gene expression evolution in
mouse or human tissue models.
We are a multidisciplinary team that focuses on the sys-
tems biology of development and evolution in mice, com-
bining population and functional genomics with molec-
ular biology and tissue engineering techniques to study
the evolution of gene regulatory network in mouse and
its close relatives. Our research group is funded by the
European Research Council (ERC) and the Max Planck
Society and is located on the Max Planck Campus in
T ubingen, Germany. Our campus hosts world-class re-
search groups and operates state-of-the-art sequencing
and other core facilities. English is the working language.
All seminars and communications are in English.
The position is available for an initial 2 years with the
possibility of extension. Salary and benets are accord-
ing to the German public service pay scale (TV oD Bund
up to and including E13) and are commensurate with
training and experience.The Max Planck Society seeks to increase the num-
ber of women in areas where they are underrepre-
sented, and therefore explicitly encourages women to
apply. The Max Planck Society is committed to em-
ploying more handicapped individuals and especially

green, and wildlife areas start right at the outskirts
(we've had bears enter city proper). It's a small city
which makes it easy to move around, it's relatively bike-

Bangor University, UK 'V Smithsonian Tropical Re-
search Institute, Panama
We are looking for a highly motivated volunteer research
assistant to support us in unravelling the mechanisms
driving secondary succession of tropical forests.
Research 'V Hyper-diverse mature tropical rainforests
have been largely degraded due to human expansion. Re-
covering forests present >70% of the global forest cover.
These secondary forests can restore some of the original
forests' ^A benets, yet they recover slowly and dier to
mature forests in tree species composition. Understand-
ing the mechanisms driving tropical forest dynamics
following disturbance is imperative to promote the re-
covery of ecosystem functionality and mitigate land-use
impacts. Species-specic interactions between trees and
their natural enemies that have evolved for thousands
of years might be the key. Our current project will
assess the impact of soil fungi in secondary succession of
tropical forests. The project will involve eld work and
a large greenhouse study in Gamboa, Panama. This
collaborative project between Bangor University (UK),
Bayreuth University (Germany) and the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute (USA, Panama) will oer
an ideal opportunity to gain research experience in the
tropics!
Job Description 'V The intern will assist in a variety of
tasks, involving eld work (e.g. seed collection), intense
manual labour (e.g. soil sieving) and greenhouse work.
Working hours will vary strongly between days, but
working weeks will never exceed 45 hours. Applicants
must be in good physical condition to be able to meet
the demands of working sometimes long hours under
challenging tropical eld work conditions, i.e. high hu-
midity and heat. Ability to drive a 4x4 transmission
truck is desirable but not required. We expect the intern
to have a strong interest in ecology and to be willing to
follow protocols to ensure the quality of data. We are
more than happy to help in developing and discussing
ideas for own research projects. We will contribute 500USD to the ight costs. Due to a limited research bud-
get, we cannot oer accommodation, but will help in
nding a place to live in Gamboa (rooms in shared ats
are available from 200-250 USD per month, including
all bills). Start date is between May and August 2018,
with earlier availability being preferred. A minimum
stay of 3 months is required. For applicants being able
to join the project in mid-May, the minimum duration
can be negotiated.
Location 'V Gamboa is a small town next to the Panama
Canal. With its vibrant scientic community, it presents
a stimulating background to develop and exchange re-
search ideas and explore a broad variety of ecological
research in the Tropics. Gamboa is an ideal base to dis-
cover Panama and Central America: on your daily stroll
through the town you can watch huge ships passing by
on the canal or discover the forest that starts directly
behind the greenhouses with its fascinating wild-life
(toucans, gigantic butteries, agoutis, etc.). Panama
City can be reached in 45 min via an adventurous bus
ride.
Applicants should send a cover letter, CV and the
names and e-mail addresses of at least two pro-
fessional or academic references to Anita Weissog
(anita.weissog@bangor.ac.uk). Shortlisted applicants
will be invited for a Skype chat.

Namibia Baboon VolFieldWork
We are currently advertising 3 volunteer positions with
the Tsaobis Baboon Project (see https://www.zsl.org/-
science/research/baboon ) The Tsaobis Baboon Project
is a eld-based wildlife research programme that studies
desert baboons in Namibia. Every year, we recruit a
small team of eld volunteers to assist with our scientic
work.
The Tsaobis Baboon Project is a long-term study of
wild desert baboons in Namibia. We are currently re-
cruiting Volunteer Field Assistants for our 2018 eld
season. These positions combine practical research with
training and are entirely eld-based. The volunteers are
trained by and work alongside doctoral students and
postdoctoral researchers, assisting with their studies
and contributing to the wider research activities of the
Baboon Project.
The eldwork will primarily involve daily follows of ba-
boon troops on foot, collecting data on the behaviour of
individually recognisable animals, together with monthly
vegetation surveys, and the capture of both study troops
to t GPS collars and collect measurements and sam-
ples. This year, our research focus is on baboon social
behaviour and female reproductive strategies.
Three Volunteer Field Assistant positions are currently
available, each running for three months from late Au-
gust to late November. Once the volunteers arrive in
Namibia, the Tsaobis Baboon Project covers all their
work-related costs, including all meals and accommo-
dation. We will also cover the costs of the volunteers'
research visas and travel insurance. On the successful
completion of eldwork, we also contribute a minimum
of pounds 75 towards the cost of the volunteers' air
ticket. The Volunteer Field Assistants will learn and
implement a range of research skills related to the study
of animal behaviour and ecology. Following training, the
eldwork will primarily involve daily follows of baboon
troops on foot, during which they will collect data on the
behaviour of individually recognisable animals, together
with monthly vegetation surveys and wider ecological
monitoring related to the baboons' environment. This
year we will also be briey capturing our study troops
to collect routine measurements and samples. Who are
we looking for?
These positions are open to all with an interest in animalMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 57
behaviour and ecology. We are particularly keen to hear
from applicants who: * Are friendly, easygoing people,
happy to live in small team under basic conditions at
a remote eld site * Are strongly motivated, reliable
and committed * Have good levels of physical tness
and stamina - you will be following the baboons on foot
from dawn to dusk over mountainous terrain in extreme
heat * Show good initiative, with a willingness to learn
and show attention to detail * Have a full, clean driving
licence.
What do volunteers get out of it? * An amazing oppor-
tunity to share the lives of wild baboons in a beautiful
desert landscape * An opportunity to learn new skills
and gain experience, especially those relevant to research
in behaviour, ecology, and conservation * An opportu-
nity to be involved in a long-term project on African
wildlife, hosted by an international research institution
and conservation charity * Most of our volunteers are
graduate students who use their experience on the Ba-
boon Project as a stepping stone on to Masters and
PhD degree course
If you would like to apply, you will need to upload a CV
and covering letter, using the online application on the
following website : https://volunteeringopportunities-
zsl.icims.com/jobs/2032/volunteer-e ld-assistant%2c-

VolFieldAssistants
We are looking for eld assistants to help search nests
of a small bird, fairy gerygone and large-billed gery-
gone for PhD project (Australian National University,
Canberra). The main objective of this research is to
gain a better understanding of the breeding ecology of
gerygone species, and the coevolution between gerygone
species and little bronze-cuckoo. Research will be con-
ducted in Queensland, Australia. We will be based in
Kutini-Payamu (Iron Range) National Park, and Cairns
city, and travel to several sites in these areas. Volunteer
eld assistants are needed from Jul. 'V Nov. or Dec.
2018 for full period. The exact dates exible but need
to be around this time.
Overall duties will include nest searching and monitor-
ing, recording begging calls and adult calls for cuckoos,
and data entry. Previous experience with eldwork is
highly desired, and nest searching experience is also pre-
ferred, but not required. The large-bill gerygone build
nests over the water, and the height of nests varies from
1m to 5m. The fairy gerygone' ^As habitat is mainly at
the edges of rainforest, but poorly unknown (our main
work will be to nd their nest). The study site is rugged,
hot, and venomous snakes and ticks are quite common.
Working days are long, with early starts, six days a week.
Therefore, applicants must have good physical tness
to walk along the creek with a heavy ladder, withstand
harsh conditions at the site, and maintain an energetic
attitude despite long hours in hot and humid conditions.
Work schedules and duties will vary, so exibility is a
must. Applicants should work well alone and in a small
group and have a sense of direction to work in remote
areas. Previous experience with eldwork is highly de-
sired, and nest searching experience is also preferred,
but a positive attitude is much more important than
tons of eld experience.
Housing will be provided, and you can get reimbursed
for food and ights up to $750 AUD per month and
assistants will enjoy fantastic wildlife viewing opportu-
nities (Wallabies, platypus, koalas, kookaburra, etc.),
proximity to Queensland rainforest and the surrounding
eld areas.

Query LabFumeHoods
Dear all,
I am reaching out to the Evoldir community for opin-
ions. We are building a molecular/structural botany
lab, and as part of it are considering installing three
fume hoods. One for DNA extraction, one for RNA
extractions/insitu hybridization work, and a third one
for anatomy purposes.
We were asked by the architects if we would like duct
fume hoods or ductless (recirculating) fume hoods. From
the construction side ductless hoods are a cheaper al-
ternative, but none of us (scientists) involved in the lab
planning has ANY experience with ductless hoods. So
we would like to ask people who have experience with
those, three questions:
1. Do they really work? If they do, what kind of pro-
cedure you perform? 2. How noisy are them compared
with a ductless fume hood? Can you or do you have to
have them on at all times? 3. Are they really cheaper
when you take into account the lters? How often do
you have to change those?
Please feel free to add any comments besides these three
questions! We really appreciate your help and if any-
body is interested in knowing the answers I get, I will
be happy to share them with you.

Software GenomicClineAnalysis R
Dear Evoldir community,
I've just uploaded a new R package to GitHub for
Bayesian hybrid index estimation and genomic cline
analysis here:|https://github.com/ribailey/gghybridA synopsis is below. Please feel free to email me with
questions or feedback.
Best regards Richard Ian Baileyrichardianbai-
ley@gmail.com
gghybrid
R package for analysis of hybrids and hybrid zones.
Currently includes hybrid index and genomic cline esti-
mation for bi-allelic genomic data.
To cite package 'gghybrid' in publications use: Richard
Bailey (2018). gghybrid: Evolutionary Analysis of Hy-
brids and Hybrid Zones. R package version 0.0.0.9000.
Basic functionality of the package is to read in SNP
data in the form of structure les or similar, prepare
data for analysis, carry out Bayesian MCMC hybrid
index and genomic cline estimation, compare models
(for either hybrid index or genomic clines) run on the
same data set using the widely applicable information
criterion (waic), and make plots of hybrid indices or
cline curves.
gghybrid can be downloaded from within R using the
following two lines of code: install.packages(\devtools");
devtools::install github(\ribailey/gghybrid") Functions
should be run in the following order: read.data #Read
in a data le in structure format or similar# data.prep
#Prepare the data for hybrid index and genomic cline
estimation# esth #Estimate hybrid indices# plot h
#Plot hybrid indices (optional)# ggcline #Estimate
genomic clines# plot clinecurve #Plot tted clines (op-
tional)# compare.models #Compare two models (either
from esth or ggcline) run on the same data set using
the widely applicable information criterion (optional)#
For usage please see help les for individual functions
by typing e.g. '?read.data'.
Synopsis: To understand mechanisms of speciation and
the evolutionary impacts of admixture it is vital to iden-
tify loci showing restricted or biased introgression among
hybridizing taxa. Genomic cline analysis provides a
means to do this, by examining patterns of introgression
of loci into foreign genomic backgrounds. Here I present
a new R package, gghybrid, which allows hypothesis-
testing on bi-allelic genomic data through Bayesian
hybrid-index (proportion of allele copies coming from
one of two parental reference sets) and logit-logistic
genomic-cline (Fitzpatrick 2013) estimation. The pack-
age takes structure les or similar data tables as input,
allows ltering of loci based on parental allele frequen-
cies, and pooling and xing of parameters followed by
model comparison for both hybrid index and genomic
clines with the Bayesian widely applicable information
criterion (waic). It therefore provides great exibility in60 EvolDir May 1, 2018
comparing, for example, populations, transects, genomic
regions or gene networks for diering patterns of ad-
mixture and introgression. It also allows rapid creation
of a genotype table, with genotypes scored according
to the parent-of-origin of each allele, and contains plot
functions for hybrid index and genomic cline estimates.
I use an adaptive algorithm during burnin to optimize
multivariate parameter proposal distributions, utilizing
both the acceptance rate and the estimated parameter
covariance matrix. Furthermore, given the intention for
the package to be used on large whole-genome data sets,
I employ recursive estimation of posterior distributions
to avoid storage of the full set of posterior values and
hence improve memory eciency.

AarhusU EvolutionaryGenetics
Join us at Aarhus University to work on basic questions
in evolutionary genetics with applied outcomes in the
area of antibiotic resistance.
A position as a postdoctoral research associate is avail-
able for 12 months (renewable for another 12 months) in
the research group of Thomas Bataillon (Bioinformatics
Research Center, Aarhus University DK). The work is
funded by the project $B!H(BPREPARE $B!I(B and
involves 5 research groups based in Canada (A Wong,
Carleton University, R Kassen U of Ottawa), Portugal
(C Bank and I Gordo, IGC Portugal) and Denmark (T
Bataillon, BiRC, Aarhus University).
The assumption that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is
$B!H(Bcostly $B!I(B underpins current thinking about
the management and stewardship of antibiotic delivery.
Evidence suggests, however, that AMR can persist at
high levels even in the absence of drug selection im-
plying either that AMR is not as costly as previously
thought or that costs are $B!H(Bover rated $B!I(B be-
cause these are labile and can be readily ameliorated
through compensatory evolution. We will evaluate these
ideas directly, through experiment, and use the data to
validate theory aimed at predicting the prevalence of
AMR across genetic backgrounds and environments.
The postdoctoral researcher will work on theoretical
models for predicting the tness changes of bacterial
strains carrying dierent types of AMR mutations acrossa variety of environments. The work will be primarily
theoretical and statistical (to help with the analysis of
experimental evolution data from the empirical side of
the project).
We expect the post-doctoral researcher to have a back-
ground in evolutionary genetics and interest in microbial
evolution. Preference will be given to candidates with
proven expertise in the area of modelling in evolutionary
genetics (either analytical theory and/or computer sim-
ulations) and microbial evolution (either experimental
evolution or population genetics of naturally occurring
populations)
The work will be carried out at the bioinformatics re-
search center (BiRC) in close collaboration with Claudia
Bank (leading the Evolutionary Dynamics group at the
Gulbenkian Institute, Oeiras Portugal).
BiRC (www.birc.au.dk) provides a young, interdisci-
plinary environment, presently with 45 professors, post
docs and PhD-students. There are strong links to De-
partment of Computer Science, Mathematics/statistics
and Biology as well as to the Faculty of Health. Within
population genomics and evolution, BiRC hosts the inte-
grated research groups of Kasper Munch (recombination,
selection in primates, X and Y chromosome evolution),
Thomas Bataillon (evolutionary theory, experimental
evolution), Asger Hobolth (coalescent methods) and
Mikkel H. Schierup (primate population genomics, X
and Y), Thomas Mailund (Bioinformatics Algorithmics,
Genetics Molecular evolution) and Palle Villesen (Bioin-
formatics NGS autoimmune disease).
The position is available as early as May 15, 2018 and
we will start to review applications immediately.May 1, 2018 EvolDir 65
For applying you should send
(1) your CV, including a list of publications and the
names and email addresses of two potential referees;
(2) a short cover letter (1 page) describing your research
interests and motivations for joining the project.
The position will be lled as soon as a qualied candi-
date is identied.

PostDoc position (E 13 TV-G-U)
in the project: \Evolution and function of species inter-

The association of organisms in symbiotic communities
is an evolutionarily highly successful concept to opti-
mally exploit available resources in a habitat. However,74 EvolDir May 1, 2018
we are only at the beginning of comprehending nature
and extent of the organismic interaction, its molecular
basis, as well as its consequences for the evolution of
molecular function. In many cases, this is due to the
complexity of the ecological niche a symbiotic commu-
nity is embedded in, which harbors a plethora of species
and provides a highly diverse spectrum of resources.
A precise delineation of the symbiotic community of-
ten hard, preventing a mechanistic understanding of
the symbiosis and of the resulting synergies. In this
project, we overcome these obstacles by concentrating
on pioneering communities, i.e. meta-organisms that
are among the rst to conquer a new, and often extreme,
habitat, such as bare rock or lava elds. On the basis
of the newly determined genome sequences of the in-
dividual symbionts, we will annotate and analyze the
encoded protein interaction networks, and their inte-
gration across the symbiotic partners. A comparison
to the results obtained from characterizing closely re-
lated species without a pioneering status is bound to
shed light on the evolutionary trajectory that adapted
a species to an extreme environment.
Your prole: - PhD in Bioinformatics, Evolutionary
Biology or related subjects
- experience and solid understanding of comparative
genomics or evolutionary biology research - experience
with de novo assembly of eukaryotic genomes and tran-

GENETIC MAPPING IN MOUSE INTERSPECIFIC
HYBRIDS USING IN VITRO CROSSES
Friedrich Miescher Laboratory, Max Planck Campus,
T ubingen, Germany
One postdoctoral position and a sta scientist position
(both for 2 years in the rst instance) are available in
the Chan Lab at the Max Planck Institute in T ubingen
as part of a prestigious 1.5M EUR European Research
Council grant investigating the role of gene regulatory
network evolution in mice by studying \in vitro" genetic
crosses.
The goal of our research is to adopt cutting-edge tissueculture techniques for studying evolutionary divergence
in gene networks. We have developed a system to use
mitotic recombination, as opposed to meiotic recombi-
nation through breeding, to generate genetic diversity
in F1 interspecic hybrid mouse ES cells under tissue
culture conditions (Lazzarano et al., PNAS, 2018). This
allows us to create recombinant cell lines of eectively
unlimited size at low costs within a matter of weeks.
We now aim to use these \in vitro recombinant" panels
to obtain phenotypic measurements via tissue engineer-
ing, organ-on-a-chip or droplet microuidic single-cell
methods.
We're looking for highly motivated individuals for the
following roles:
1) Postdoc: You should be about to earn, or have re-
cently earned your PhD in the areas of genetics, molecu-
lar biology or regenerative medicine. You should demon-
strate expertise in tissue culture techniques. You should
be able to demonstrate promise in early career success
in a rst author publication or preprint ready for sub-
mission. A background in genetic mapping or GWAS
will be advantageous. A background in evolutionary
biology will be helpful, but not a requirement. We are
interested in candidates who are keen to apply and de-
velop new genetic tools and technologies. Passion for
research, team spirit and enthusiasm are essential.
2) Sta scientist: You should hold a Bachelors-equivalent
degree or higher qualications in the areas of genetics,
molecular biology or regenerative medicine. We are
looking for a strong track-record and demonstrated re-
search experience and training, particularly in tissue
culture and aseptic techniques. You will be a central
team member assigned to work closely with a postdoc
in carrying out work mainly using tissue culture, tis-
sue engineering and microuidics techniques. We will
provide training on advanced tissue engineering tech-
niques and microuidics device fabrication, including
but not limited to ow or microuidics models to assay
expression and tissue phenotypes. You will also operate
ow cytometry instrument(s) in the context of tissue
dierentiation and single-cell studies. You will assist in
generating DNA and RNAseq libraries to help dissect
the genetic architecture of gene expression evolution in
mouse or human tissue models.
We are a multidisciplinary team that focuses on the sys-
tems biology of development and evolution in mice, com-
bining population and functional genomics with molec-
ular biology and tissue engineering techniques to study
the evolution of gene regulatory network in mouse and
its close relatives. Our research group is funded by the
European Research Council (ERC) and the Max Planck
Society and is located on the Max Planck Campus in78 EvolDir May 1, 2018
T ubingen, Germany. Our campus hosts world-class re-
search groups and operates state-of-the-art sequencing
and other core facilities. English is the working language.
All seminars and communications are in English.
The position is available for an initial 2 years with the
possibility of extension. Salary and benets are accord-
ing to the German public service pay scale (TV oD Bund
up to and including E13) and are commensurate with
training and experience.
The Max Planck Society seeks to increase the num-
ber of women in areas where they are underrepre-
sented, and therefore explicitly encourages women to
apply. The Max Planck Society is committed to em-
ploying more handicapped individuals and especially
encourages them to apply. For more information

MichiganStateU PopulationGenetics
The Bradburd Lab at Michigan State is looking for a
motivated, independent postdoc to join the lab! The
lab is focused on population and evolutionary genetics,
and especially on developing statistical methods to learn
about evolutionary history of populations over spaceand time in a variety of empirical systems, including
humans. There are currently two main lines of inquiry
in the lab: 1) Spatial population genetics: using pop-
ulation genetic data to study the processes that have
generated patterns of genetic variation, with a particular
focus on isolation, migration, and local adaptation.
2) Temporal population genetics: studying how popula-
tion structure changes across space and through time,
especially geared toward understanding population re-
placement and how populations adapt to climate change.
The specics of the research projects are exible, but
could include methods for inferring spatial population
genetic structure and admixture, quantifying the ge-
nomic ngerprint of adaptation to climate change, or
identifying the genetic basis of traits in admixed popu-
lations.
Michigan State is an excellent place to conduct research
in population genetics, with numerous research groups
focused on similar areas (e.g., Braasch, Boughman, Con-
ner, Edger, Fitzpatrick, Gallant, Huang, Lenski, Liu,
Lowry, Meek, Scribner, Shiu). The Bradburd lab is a
safe space and is committed to increasing diversity in
the scientic community. I therefore strongly encour-
age applications from diverse candidates with related
scientic interests.
Qualications: Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, computa-
tional biology, mathematical biology statistics, or simi-
lar eld. Strong interest in scripting/programming and
statistics is required. Strong background in same is a
bonus!
Salary will be competitive and dependent on previous
experience. Start date is exible, but ideally sometime
summer/fall 2018.
To apply, please visit careers.msu.edu, respond to Job
#498306, and submit a cover letter, current CV, and
contact information for 3 referees. Informal inquiries
welcome (bradburd [at] msu [dot] edu). More informa-

NewYorkU EvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral position, Rockman Lab, NYU
Join us at NYU to work on fundamentantal questions
in evolutionary genetics as a postdoctoral research asso-
ciate.
We have an NIH-funded position to study the evolu-
tionary genetics of complex traits, using a neotropical
species of obligately-outcrossing Caenorhabditis nema-
tode (relatives of C. elegans) as an experimental model.
The species has convenient attributes for sampling vari-
ation from nature and constructing replicable genotypes
that vary in autozygosity. The core research question
is this: how can we predict the dominance of segregat-
ing variants? Directional dominance is ubiquitous but
often neglected in evolutionary genetics and genomic
prediction. Our powerful experimental system gives us
a means to make substantial contributions here. Let's
learn new things!
The postdoctoral researcher will have opportunities to
approach the work from the perspectives of empirical or
theoretical quantitative genetics, empirical or theoretical
population genetics, comparative genomics, experimen-
tal model-organism genetics, and molecular developmen-
tal biology. An ideal candidate will be comfortable in
one of these domains and eager to gain experience in one
or more of the others. The position includes the option
to conduct eldwork with the worms in Panama, and
the postdoc will have substantial autonomy to shape
the direction of the research.
The Rockman Lab works on evolutionary genetics and
genomics, with a focus on the relationship between devel-
opmental mechanisms and population-level phenotypic
variation and evolution. Other funded projects in the lab
center on developmental variation in a marine annelid
populations, causes and consequences of recombination
rate variation in nematode genomes, and quantitative
genetics of growth patterns in pennate diatoms. NYU
and the New York area are home to a broad group of
evolutionary biologists and geneticists and an enormous
community of exceptionally collaborative nematode re-
searchers. This is a terric training environment for a
postdoc using worms to study evolution. New York City
has a lot to oer, and NYU provides subsidized housing
for postdocs near our lab in Greenwich Village.
NYU is an Equal Opportunity Employer and is commit-ted to a policy of equal treatment and opportunity in
every aspect of its recruitment and hiring process with-
out regard to age, alienage, caregiver status, childbirth,
citizenship status, color, creed, disability, domestic vi-
olence victim status, ethnicity, familial status, gender

6 -25,728- 31,604 p.a. The closing date for this post is
midnight on Monday 30th April 2018. Interviews are
being held on Friday 11th May 2018.
A 10-month, full-time postdoctoral position is available
to work with Drs Luc Bussi ere (Stirling), Matthew Tins-
ley (Stirling) and Ricardo Polanczyk (UNESP, Brazil)
on a BBSRC-FAPESP Newton funded grant \Overcom-
ing insecticide resistance using diverse fungal pathogens
and heterogeneous agricultural landscapes". The project
studies the interactions between lepidopteran crop pests
and fungal pathogens that can be deployed as biopesti-
cides.The Post Despite extensive research on insecticide appli-
cation regimes, insecticidal compounds and genetically
modied crops, insects continue to evolve resistance
against control agents with predictable regularity. In an
eort to develop more sustainable approaches to pest
control, our project borrows insights from evolutionary
science and the particular features of host-pathogen in-
teractions. Insecticide resistance evolution occurs when
a single control agent is applied over a broad area, then
consistent evolutionary pressures drive previously-rare
resistance genes to spread rapidly through the pest pop-
ulation. To prevent this, we will study how multiple
fungal pathogen biopesticide strains can be used in a
spatial matrix across agricultural landscapes, so that
selection for resistance varies in dierent locations, pre-
venting a uniform evolutionary response.
This post is based in Stirling, but joins a project that
combines research in Stirling and Jaboticabal, Brazil
to study the genetic architecture of host resistance to
several entomopathogenic fungi when insects are reared
on several dierent host plants. The project studies
lepidopteran crop pests and investigates the power of
genotype by environment interactions to prevent resis-
tance evolution to fungal pathogens used in biocontrol.
Collaboration and joint training with other researchers
involved in the project will be encouraged and facilitated
The research will be conducted using the Stirling Univer-
sity's state-of-the-art Controlled Environment Facility
and University Gardens. The appointee will be part of
a thriving research environment within Biological and
Environmental Sciences (BES) with more than 40 prin-

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION
Dear all,
In the context of an European Project on Marine
Metabarcoding Benthic Biodiversity, we are seeking
to recruit an enthusiastic and highly motivated Postdoc-
toral researcher to work at the laboratory of Ecological
and Environmental Genetics in Ravenna Campus (Uni-
versity of Bologna, Italy).
The successful applicant will be involved in a research
project aiming to use barcoding and metabarcoding
(DNA based identication and high-throughput DNA
sequencing) to unlock the barriers that prevented the
development of marine monitoring networks for hard
bottoms benthic habitats, in particular by: (1) estab-
lishing rationale rules based on connectivity patterns
to determine the network of sites to be monitored, (2)
standardizing the sampling procedures for hard bottom
assemblages, and (3) nding solutions to automatize
and standardize species composition assessment. The
project includes partners from France, Italy and Spain
and will assess the communities established on natural
substrates and which type of systems for standardized
sampling of hard substrates (e.g. ARMS, ASU) better
represents them. Species composition will be assessed
using, and improving, innovative automatized meth-
ods (e.g. metabarcoding) calibrated with traditional
identications based on morphology.
The candidates must have a PhD degree in an area that
includes the use of modern molecular biological meth-
ods to answering environmental or ecological questions,
and with enough publications and experience in thecorresponding themes.
The candidate will be primarily responsible for eld-
work, metabarcoding libraries, analyses of data, and
shall contribute to manuscript writing.
The candidates should have experience in: 1. Experi-
mental planning and eldwork, organisation of sample
collection (at least second level dive certication).
2. DNA extraction, barcoding and preparation of library
for metabarcoding; Statistical analyses; scripting in R;
bioinformatic methods for analysis of high throughput
DNA sequencing in DNA metabarcoding applications;
and high quality data presentation for publication.
3. Morphological taxonomy of benthic species (inverte-
brates, algae).
4. Working knowledge of English, good communication,
teamwork and organisational skills as well as to be able
to work independently.
The work will be mainly conducted at the Ravenna Cam-
pus (University of Bologna). However, the candidates
may be required to do some eldwork and spend some
time in other labs, both in France and in Spain.
Moreover, there will be opportunities for training, con-
ference attendance and networking.
The position is a full time contract available immedi-
ately (September 2018) for one year in the rst instance,
with the possibility after review to extend the contract
for further two years.

UCalgary ConvergentAdaptation
The Yeaman lab at the University of Calgary is look-
ing to hire a postdoctoral fellow to work on a meta-
analysis studying the repeatability of adaptation at
the genome scale. The basic idea of the project is to
apply some methods we recently developed (https://-
www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/09/279661) to
quantify the repeatability of adaptation in a range of
published datasets and test hypotheses about potential
causal factors. We expect that this will include datasets
from experimental evolution in microbes and genome
scans of local adaptation in natural populations, but
may extend to data on QTLs. There is a particular
interest in applying these methods to medically relevant
traits. Depending upon the interests of the applicant, it
would also be possible to work on some individual-based
simulations exploring a range of questions related to the
genetic and genomic architecture of adaptation. This
position will require advanced R skills and familiarity
with GWAS and other genome scan methods.
The position will run for 2+ years (CAD $50k salary +
benets).

has a post-doctoral position available for motivated
candidates with background in statistical population
genetics and/or data science.
Our lab focuses on using statistical and computational
approaches to study questions in human genetics and
evolutionary biology. A central aim in the lab is to
understand the impact of evolutionary history on ge-
netic variation and to apply this knowledge to learn
about human history and biology. To this end, we use
genetic data from ancient specimens and present-day
species to learn about: (1) when key events (such as
introgression and adaptations) occurred in human his-
tory, (2) how dierent evolutionary processes such as
mutation rate evolve across primates, and (3) how we
can leverage these patterns to identify genetic variants
related to human adaptation and disease. The research
in the lab involves both development of new methods
and large-scale genomic data analysis.
Responsibilities: A successful candidate will develop
and apply computational approaches to large genomic
datasets to characterize patterns of population history
and evolution. The main responsibilities include con-
ducting research, attending regular lab meetings and
journal clubs, and preparing research results for pub-
lication and presentations at scientic meetings. Op-
portunities may also exist for mentoring graduate and
undergraduate students.
Minimum/Basic Qualications required at the time of
application: - Completion of all doctoral degree re-
quirements except the dissertation in genetics, compu-
tational biology, biostatistics, population genetics or
related elds.
Additional Qualications (required by start date): -
PhD or equivalent degree in genetics, computationalbiology, biostatistics, population genetics or a related
eld.
- Knowledge of statistics and population genetics theory.
- Demonstrated record of research productivity and pub-
lications.
- Programming experience (e.g. C/C++, Python/ Perl,
R or other programming languages)
Preferred Qualications: Experience with large-scale
genomic data analysis.
Salary: This is a full-time position. Salary is commen-
surate with qualications and experience.

is seeking a Post-Doctoral Researcher to support an
important new research project in the area of conserva-
tion biology: Horizon 2020 AMBER project - Adaptive
Management of Barriers in European Rivers (https:/-
/amber.international/). The position will be based at
the Marine Institute' ^As research facility in Newport Co.
Mayo, but the successful candidate will be expected to
travel and liaise with a large network of 20 partners
from 11 countries. Essential requirements 'V A PhD in
life sciences or equivalent disciplines with experience in
conservation assessment of vertebrate taxa. Knowledge
of Population Viability Analysis, IUCN Red List classi-
cation and relevant software (e.g. RAMAS; VORTEX;
MARXAM; InVEST), and Geographical Information
Systems is required. A publication record commensurate
with career stage is expected.
Background to project There are a conservatively c.
5,000 unique Atlantic salmon populations in the North-
east Atlantic, whose existence is important for main-
taining the resilience of the species (portfolio eect).
The species is currently classied as ' ^A ¥Vulnerable' ^A
in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Unfor-
tunately, the IUCN assessment did not take into ac-
count dierences in the conservation status of individual
stocks (including sub-populations within individual river
basins), some of which (particularly in S. Europe) may
be near extinction. The species has gone extinct in Bel-
gium, Czech Republic, Germany, Netherlands, Poland,
Slovakia, and Switzerland, and many populations have
been lost from the Iberian Peninsula, Denmark, Sweden,
Norway, Ireland, France, England, Wales, Scotland, and
European Russia. Although local extirpations have been
attributed to a number of factors, the damming of rivers
and subsequent loss of connectivity has been signalledas the principal and most widespread cause for salmon
declines.
This project will use the Barrier Inventory being de-
veloped in the AMBER project to undertake a trans-
European, river by river assessment of the status of At-
lantic salmon within a Geographical Information System
(GIS) based framework. We will be focussing specically
on the impact of barriers on river connectivity and the
distribution of the species within individual watersheds.
We will apply AMBER tools to provide the rst quanti-
tative, river by river assessment of the conservation of
A. salmon across Europe, and determine barrier eect
thresholds. These models will be validated with spa-
tially explicit national juvenile salmon stock assessment
datasets collated by various national agencies within
the EU.
A key deliverable of this task will be to provide accu-
rate estimates of the global extent of river habitats lost
to Atlantic salmon (and other migratory sh) across
Europe at four spatial scales: 1. Individual river sys-
tems; 2. Genetically explicit regionally river groups; 3.
Politically explicit regional groups; 4. Trans-European
level.
Furthermore, we will seek to identify, locate and target
barriers whose removal or modication will result in
the greatest benet for the restoration of self-sustaining
populations and highest economic and social return.
A second important deliverable will be the production of
the EU Salmon Atlas and associated database which will
be overlaid with the European Barrier Inventory. For
this we will work closely with European Joint Research
Centre and Swansea University (Prof Carlos Garcia de
Leaniz, c.garciadeleaniz@swansea.ac.uk).

HumanEvolutionaryGenetics
Post-doctoral position in Human Evolutionary Genetics
and Epigenetics, Laboratory of Connie Mulligan, Ge-
netics Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL,
USA
Post-doctoral position to work on two ongoing NSF and
internally funded projects:
1) Investigation of genetic, epigenetic, and biological
signatures of war trauma exposures in Syrian refugees.
This is a collaboration with Catherine Panter-Brick
(Yale University) and Rana Dajani (Hashemite Univer-
sity, Jordan) to integrate genetic and epigenetic analyses
into an ongoing study to measure the eects of violence
and trauma in Syrian refugees. The rst project is an
intergenerational study to investigate the epigenetic im-
pacts in ospring of mothers and grandmothers who were
exposed to war trauma while pregnant. The overarching
question is to determine if trauma-induced methylation
changes are heritable across two generations in humans.
In the second project, genetic variants are being assayed
to predict the impact of past trauma exposures and
the eects of a program intervention on self-reported
measures of mental health in Syrian refugee youth. Epi-
genetic variants will be tested as possible mediators
of the eect of stress on mental health outcomes. See
project website at http://www.elrha.org/map-location/-yale-psychosocial-call2/ .
2) Investigation of an epigenetic mechanism to me-
diate the eects of maternal stress on maternal and
infant health in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). We are testing for associations between ma-
ternal stress exposures, newborn health outcomes and
changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in
mothers and their infants. More broadly, we are inter-
ested in the idea that mechanisms may have evolved
to allow the genome to respond to psychosocial stres-
sors and that complex phenotypes may be shaped
by early life experiences that alter gene expression
through epigenetic alterations. Samples and data
have already been collected and research is funded
by NSF. See http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/-
10.4161/epi.21180 and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/-
doi/10.1111/cdev.12487/epdf .
Qualications: A PhD, good publication record, and
strong background in the generation of genetic data
(microarray, gene expression, NGS, SNP detection) and
data analysis (gene association analysis, regression anal-
ysis, genetic ancestry estimation, linkage analysis, etc)
are essential. A background in evolutionary genetics
and experience with methylation data (Illumina chips,
pyrosequencing, etc), RNA sequence or gene expression
array data, and/or additional computational or bioin-
formatics experience is a plus. Candidates who speak
French or Swahili are encouraged to apply. In addition
to the projects listed above, there are excellent opportu-
nities for the successful candidate to develop new lines
of research as well as productive collaborations outside

UMassachusetts Amherst
MicrobiomeEvolution VisitingProf
The Biology Department at the University of Mas-
sachusetts Amherst seeks candidates with exceptional
promise in research, commitment to outstanding teach-
ing and the ability to work with people of diverse per-
spectives, experiences, and backgrounds for a 3-Year
Visiting Assistant Professor (VAP) position starting in
September 2018. This is an unusual position that re-
quires sponsorship of a faculty member with an active
research laboratory and requires teaching an experiential
research course for undergraduate students.
My laboratory is sponsoring candidates with interests
in microbiome research. The VAP will join an ac-
tive research group that includes external collabora-
tors associated with the Harvard Forest, the DOE Joint
Genome Institute (JGI), the DOE Environmental Molec-
ular Sciences Laboratories (EMSL), and New England
BioLabs (NEB). With funding from DOE, NSF and
NEB we are developing a genetic scaold for soil com-
munity research at Harvard Forest through phylotype,
metagenome, metatranscriptome and single cell sequenc-
ing of forest soil organisms in our experimental warming
plots. The VAP will leverage these emerging data sets
to discovery novel taxonomic groups, determine how
long-term warming has changed population structure of
soil microorganisms and to detect evidence of selection
in response to warming.
Our recent project with the JGI using ow cytometry
to separate out single cells resulted over 2,000 genomes
and identication of novel viral and bacterial groups,
some that are likely associated in the soil with eukarotic
hosts. I am willing to sponsor candidates from diverse
scientic backgrounds including entymology, mycology,May 1, 2018 EvolDir 95
protistology, virology and bacteriology that will bring
new perspectives to the project and that are motivated
to develop genomic methods for sequencing organisms
directly from the environment. We will work with the
VAP to write grants, including large scale sequencing
projects that will provide the VAP support in setting
up an independent research program.
For 20 years I have been teaching genomics and bioin-
formatics courses, including hands-on Perl, Python and
R sessions often capped with student designed research
projects. The Visiting Assistant Professor (VAP), with
my assistance, will develop a new genomics and bioin-
formatics laboratory course to provide an inquiry-based
research experience for a maximum of 20 undergraduate
students per semester. In the rst semester the VAP
and faculty mentor will plan the development of the new
lab course (with a bent towards the interests and experi-
ences of the VAP). In the second semester, the VAP and
faculty mentor teach the course together as a pilot. In
semesters 3-6 the VAP leads the course, with guidance
and participation from the faculty mentor. The VAP is
expected to continue research throughout the academic
year and summer.
This position requires the ability to work with diverse
populations/students. Our research group has an ex-
tensive history of working with underrepresented un-
dergraduate and graduate students at UMass. We are
especially interested in candidates whose accomplish-
ments reect engagement with varied perspectives and
constituencies.

in the Revell lab at the University of Massachusetts
Boston to work on phylogenetic comparative method
development in R. Qualications should include expe-

1. The position is for a *minimum of 2 years* (given
satisfactory progress, etc.) rather than for one year as
previously advertised.
2. The postdoc is for *phylogenetic comparative method
development in particular*, rather than phylogeny meth-
ods more broadly.
I consider phylogenetic comparative methods to include
anything related to the use of phylogenies to make evo-
lutionary inferences (rather than the estimation of phy-
logenetic trees) - but please contact me if you'd like
clarication (liam.revell@umb.edu).

UOttawa FungalPlantGenomics
\Three year Postdoctoral position in Fungal/Plant
genome analysis
A Postdoctoral Fellow position is available in the
laboratory of Dr. Nicolas Corradi (https://-
corradilab.weebly.com/) at the University of Ottawa
(ON, Canada). The position is initially available for one
year, and is renewable for up to 3 years.
The position is partially funded by Mitacs (https://-
www.mitacs.ca/en). The successful applicant will spend
most of his/her research time in the Corradi lab, and
the PDF research is expected to improve knowledge
of important bio-fertilizers and natural products using
genome analyses. Throughout the research, the PDF
will also acquire important professional skills in data
management and participate in an industry-relevant
R&D product with high translational potential through
collaborations with the industry. In particular, the
successful PDF will acquire unique experience in the
domain of organic agriculture, natural health product
research, regulation, and industry practices.
Projects:
The applicant is expected to work on these two projects
in collaboration with PhD students.
1) Assembly, annotation and analysis of dikaryotic ar-
buscular mycorrhizal genomes:
Recent studies from our lab (see Ropars et al. 2016
Nature Microbiology; Corradi and Brachmann, 2017,
Trends in Plant Science) have shown that model AMF
strains are either homokaryotic - i.e. contain multiple
co-existing nuclei with one MAT-locus and one domi-
nant genome - or "dikaryotic\ - i.e. all nuclei harbor
one of two co-existing and diverging MAT-loci.
Recent studies in our lab have revealed the existence of
many additional dikaryotic AMF strains, providing new
and exciting opportunities to investigate the genome
evolution and biology of this unique cellular condition.
The applicant will be involved in the acquisition of op-
timal - ideally chromosome level - assemblies for all
dikaryotic strains found to date. This will be done by
combining Illumina sequencing approaches with long-98 EvolDir May 1, 2018
read technologies (PacBio, Nanopore). New genome
assemblies will be annotated and compared to investi-
gate the degree, nature and function of genome diversity
that is present within and among AMF dikaryons. In
parallel, the newly assembled genomes will be used to
detect the relative contribution of each nucleotype to
the AMF development and establishment of mycorrhizal
symbiosis using RNA-seq approaches.
2) Assembly, annotation and analysis of the Echinaea
purpurea genome.
Echinacea species are widely used for medicinal pur-
poses, with a global market of $1 billion, yet high-quality
genome data from this group is lacking. This project
aims to distinguish unique Echinacea genetic resources
by identifying new and improved traits related to both
agriculture and natural health product through genome
analyses.
In collaboration with other plant genome experts, the
PDF will identify putative new genes and biochemical
pathways to guide development of new products with
improved medicinal properties. The PDF will also ben-
et from interdisciplinary research skills provided by
this collaboration (i.e. in-house laboratory work, bioin-
formatics) and the R&D experience with the industrial
collaborator, which builds industry-relevant knowledge
relating to natural products and agriculture.
Applicants and Desired Skills:
Applicants are expected to have strong background in
"Genome Analysis\, and in handling large amounts of se-
quence data. Evidence of prior success with assembly of
large and complex genomes using long-read technologies
is desired. Past practical knowledge of Plant Genomics,
or evidence of work on highly heterozygous diploid and
/or polyploid organisms, will be seen as an asset for this
position.
Starting date and Application:
The position is available starting August 2018, with
the application process closing as soon as a suitable
candidate is found. A complete application package will
include: 1) a CV; 2) a short description of past research
accomplishments and future goals; and, 3) the names
and e-mail addresses of at least 2 references.
Complete applications can be sent to Dr. Nicolas Cor-

KelpGenomics
Post-Doctoral Research Associate
The Department of Biological Sciences at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is currently ac-
cepting application submissions for a postdoctoral ap-
pointment in Dr. Filipe Alberto's laboratory, study-
ing genetic improvement for aquaculture of the gi-
ant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. This is part of a
grant funded by the Department of Energy, Arpa.e
agency, program Mariner. You can read more about
this program here https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-
programs/mariner. And learn about some of the funded
projects here (https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=news-item/department-energy-announces-18- new-projects-
accelerate-development-macroalgae-production).
The postdoc will be conducting the development of a
germplasm collection of haploid strains of kelp (brown
algae). The collection will be the basis for a genetic
improvement program aimed at faster growth; and tem-
perature and low nutrient tolerance in aquaculture. The
postdoc will contribute to routine culture tasks, but
mostly through supervision of a research assistant and
undergraduate students. Experience in growing kelp
cultures in the laboratory conditions is preferable but
not essential, training can be provided.
Preferred skills: Experience with genomic analysis,
both wet and dry lab, including the analysis of high-
throughput sequencing data, coding experience in R,
Python or other languages and excellent organizational
skills and capacity to work under strict deadlines.

in evolutionary ecology, plant breeding, population ge-
netics/genomics or genetics. Familiarity with population
genetics/genomics software is essential, as well as high-
level of motivation to publish results, as evidenced by
the candidate's publication record.
During the rst year, most project tasks will involve
cultivation of individual haploid strains to provide su-
cient biomass to extract DNA in quantity and quality
required for genomic analysis. Microsatellite marker
analysis will also be used to monitor strain identify and
purity at dierent stages of growth. The germplasm col-
lection will be the basis for a Marker Assisted Selection
program developed with partner institutions (UC Santa
Barbara, U Southern California and JCVI) involving
genome sequencing and annotation, phenotype typing of
outplanted sporophytes in Southern California, capture
sequencing of genetic variants (SNP) and the estimation
of a predictive model linking genotype and phenotype
for traits of interest.
Other broad research interests in the Alberto lab are
population genetics and evolutionary ecology of sea-
weeds and marine plants. Our focus is both on em-
pirical research through the acquisition of population
genetics data, using molecular marker techniques, and
simulation-based hypothesis testing.
Informal inquiries about the project are encouraged.

Dear colleague
I wanted to bring your attention to a 4-day work-
shop on agricultural microbiomes and their ecologi-
cal/evolutionary interactions we are organising in Thai-
land this June.
Run by Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment in col-
laboration with UTS (Prof Aaron Darling), and Kaset-
sart University, the workshop aims to up-skill and em-
power a small number of participants (of any level,
Student, Post-doc or Faculty) to run microbiome exper-
iments.
Specically:
* learning about the state of the art in microbiome
genomics (for biodiversity and functional analyses)
* how to design a microbiome experiment and under-
take quality control (because as we say in genomics:
well-designed samples in - >well designed papers out)
* create a 16S library (a wet lab component where you
will see that making your own libraries is not that hard!)
* analyse it using the QIIME 2 package (focusing on
the ecological theory and what it actually means rather
than just copying commands)
The expertise of the group comes from a number of
sources (medical, marine, insects, plants) and even
though the science will be broad, we will keep the tech-
niques species agnostic :)
Beyond teaching core skills, the workshop aims to also
explain the state of the art in the genomics of agricul-
tural microbiomes, lighting talks from selected partici-
pants, and signicant time for research networking. We
think this will be an awesome experience for researchers
who want to expand their skill set and interact with
like-minded people.
The schedule and further information are available here:
http://stressedfruity.com/bangkok2018/ The deadline
for registration is approaching rapidly (7th of May) and
we may have to cap registration to ensure the correct
student-teacher ratio.
We have tried to keep the costs to minimum but if you
have/are student from a non-biomedical laboratory with
limited funding, we're happy to negotiate a discountMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 107
after the 7th of May (if there are still open positions).
Please feel free to forward this email to anyone who
might be interested.
If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me.

Course Announcement: ' ^AEcology through the omics
lens'^A
Dear colleagues,
The 6th edition of the Ramon Margalef Summer Col-
loquia: ' ^AEcology through the omics lens' ^A organized
by the Marine Sciences Institute (ICM-CSIC) will take
place from July 8th- 13th in Barcelona, Spain.
Course Overview: The use of omics techniques has
spread rapidly across the eld of Ecology and Evolution
during the last decade, but there is substantial work
ahead to link the obtained results with the existent eco-
logical theory. The course aims to move from \what" to
\why" when using omics approaches to study the ecosys-
tem, as well as to frame their omics-based research in a
theoretical ecological framework. The course will cover
dierent environments (marine, terrestrial, host associ-
ated) as well as organismal sizes (from microbes to plants
and animals), thus becoming an excellent opportunity
to bring together researchers with similar questions, but
working in elds that seldom communicate between each
other.
The Colloquium will be structured in 4 sessions. Each
session consist of a combination of lectures, and group
discussion.
Advanced doctoral students and early post-docs are
encouraged to apply.
More information and registrations: http://-
www.acoio.org/margalef-summer-colloquia or write usto: margalefcolloquia[a]acoio.org
Registration is open until 30th April.
Fellowships to students from developing countries are
available.

Course: Data Manipulation and Visualization with
Python
Berlin, 15th-19th October 2018
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course38/ )
INSTRUCTOR:
DR. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists: (
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/) )
Overview One of the strengths of the Python language
is the availability of mature, high- quality libraries for
working with scientic data. Integration between the
most popular libraries has lead to the concept of a \sci-
entic Python stack": a collection of packages which
are designed to work well together. In this workshop
we will see how to leverage these libraries to eciently
work with and visualize large volumes of data.
Format The workshop is delivered over ten half- day
sessions. Each session consists of roughly a one hour
lecture followed by two hours of practical exercises, with
breaks at the organizer's discretion. Each session uses
examples and exercises that build on material from the
previous one, so it's important that students attend all
sessions. The last two sessions will be kept free forstu-
dents to work on their own datasets with the assistance
of the instructor. A description of the sessions can be
found at the bottom of this page.
Assumed Background This workshop is aimed at re-
searchers and technical workers with a background in
biology and a basic knowledge of Python (if you've
taken the Introductory Python course then you have
the Python knowledge; if you're not sure whether you108 EvolDir May 1, 2018
know enough Python to benet from this course then
just drop us an email).
Requirements Students should have enough biologi-
cal/bioinformatics background to appreciate the exam-
ple datasets. They should also have some basic Python
experience (the Introduction to Python course will ful-
ll these requirements). Students should be familiar
with the use of lists, loops, functions and conditions in
Python and have written at least a few small programs
from scratch. Students will require the scientic Python
stack to be installed on their laptops before attending;
instructions for this will be sent out prior to the course.

Berlin Epigenomics May28-Jun1
LastCall
Dear all,
we still have a few places available for the course \Epige-
nomic Data Analysis" which will be held in Berlin from
the 28th of May to the 01st of June 2018.
Registration deadline: 26th April 2018.
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course31/ )
Instructors:
Dr. Federico Comoglio (Cambridge Institute for Medical
Research (UK))
Dr. Iros Barozzi (Imperial College London (UK))
OverviewThis course will introduce researchers and technical
workers to the bioinformatic analysis of large epigenomic
data sets obtained using Next-Generation Sequencing
(NGS) technologies, with a focus on ChIP-seq, RNA-seq
and DNase-seq / ATAC-seq. The course will cover the
theoretical foundations of the most widely adopted al-
gorithms and analysis pipelines, a targeted introduction
to scripting in bash and R/BioConductor, and extensive
hands-on tutorials using publicly available NGS data
sets. At the end of this course, the students should be
able to eciently analyze their own data and identify
common pitfalls of genomics data analyses.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at researchers moving the rst steps
in epigenomic data analysis and / or interested in learn-
ing more about this subject. The course will oer a
balanced mixture of lectures and hands-on practical
tutorials using popular tools and R/BioConductor pack-
ages. Previous knowledge of genomics data formats from
Illumina sequencers and exposure to bioinformatics is
benecial but not a necessary prerequisite.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background
in biology and understand the central role of DNA for
biodiversity studies. No programming or scripting ex-
pertise is required and some basic introduction to UNIX-
based command line applications will be provided on
the rst day. However, some basic experience with using
command line and/or R is clearly an advantage as not
all the basics can be thoroughly covered in that short
amount of time. All hands-on exercises will be run in
UNIX-environments (Linux, Mac) on remote servers.
Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStudio.

Dr. St ephane Joost (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Oliver Selmoni, MSc (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Workshop overview Landscape genomics is an emerging
research eld that studies how genetic diversity dis-
tributes across space and how environmental features
can modify this structure through local adaptation. In
this workshop, students will learn the basics of this ap-
proach and train using state of the art methods. The
course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
Firstly, students will learn how to obtain environmental
data from publicly available databases, how to process
it with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how
to use the latter to produce indicators able to describe
the characteristics of the landscape. Next, the course
will discuss the dierent approaches to obtain genetic
data and subsequently show how to study genetic vari-
ation and population structure across space in the R
environment. Students will be given an overview of the
dierent statistical approaches to study local adapta-
tion, and will be trained in using two of them, Sambada
and LFMM. The course will also cover the critical task
of the interpretation and validation of the results. Fi-
nally, the workshop will consider the crucial aspects and
good habits to account for when planning a landscape
genomics experiment (e.g. sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background This work-
shop is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneticists,
veterinarians that want to implement the landscape ge-
nomics approach in their own studies of evolutionary
biology and conservation. Even though the course is not
intended for a specialized audience, basic knowledge in
evolutionary biology and population genetics would help.Students will learn how to use GIS, but basic computer
skills are desirable (e.g. in the R environment). A basic
understanding of statistics is also necessary.
Teaching Format The course is organized in ten learning
sessions. During the rst two sessions, the course will
provide a contextualization of the research eld. Then,
students will be guided through a landscape genomics
experiment with sessions that couple brief theoretical
introductions with practical work.

WHERE
BGBM, K onigin-Luise-Strae 6-8, 14195 Berlin
Instructor: Dr. Michael Matschiner (University of
Basel (Switzerland); [ www.evoinformatics.eu ]( http:/-
/www.evoinformatics.eu ))
overview Recent advances in sequencing technology, and
the rapid increase in the availability of genetic data,
have revolutionized the eld of phylogenetics. While
genomic data promise unprecedented insights into the
evolution of the tree of life, they also pose new challenges
that must be addressed to avoid misleading results and
to fully leverage the potential of the genome-scale data
sets. These challenges include the identication of or-
thologuous sequences that are suitable as phylogenetic
markers, the selection of appropriate models of sequence110 EvolDir May 1, 2018
evolution, and the detection of gene-tree discordance
due to incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. In
this workshop I will present theory and exercises to infer
time-calibrated phylogenies from multi-locus, RADseq,
and whole-genome data sets while accounting for these
confounding factors.
Workshop Format The workshop will be delivered over
the course of ve days. Each day will include an intro-
ductory lecture with class discussion of key concepts.
The remainder of each day will consist of practical hands-
on sessions. These sessions will involve a combination of
both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demon-
strate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own
to complete individual exercises. After and during each
exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a
group. Computing will be done using tools installed on
the attendees laptop computer.
Who Should Attend This workshop is aimed at re-
searchers, PhD or postdoc level planning to infer phylo-
genetic relationships and divergence times from multi-
locus, RADseq, or whole-genome data.
Requirements Attendents should have basic knowledge
of UNIX and will need to use the command line on their
laptops. Familiarity with a scripting language such as
Ruby, Python, or Perl will be helpful but is not required.

Champaign; http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/)
Dr. Josie Paris (University of Sussex, UK)
Overview
Reduced representation genome sequencing methods
are revolutionizing evolutionary analyses of non-model
organisms. Several data generation and data analysis
protocols have been developed to generate thousands of
sequence variants in hundreds of individuals at relative
low cost and speed. In this course, we will introduce
the dierent approaches for obtaining reduced represen-
tation genome sequencing data and will specially focus
on the data analysis. We will cover all necessary steps
to obtain genome variants from short read data that are
informative for population genetics, phylogenetic and
association studies.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are generating and/or analyzing reduced repre-
sentation genome sequencing data (RAD-seq, ddRAD,
2bRAD, GBS, $B!D(B). Examples demonstrated in this
course will involve primarily non-model organisms and
examples of applications of this data type for dierent
purposes will be covered. Attendees should have a back-
ground in biology. We will dedicate one session to some
basic and advanced Linux concepts. Attendees should
have also some familiarity with genomic data such as
that arising from NGS sequencers.

CatalinaIsland Genomics Aug10-26
Hi Colleagues,
This summer our team is oering two workshops on
the use of high-throughput sequencing to study gene
expression and genetic variation. For more details,
see this link or the description that follows. http:/-
/people.oregonstate.edu/ ~meyere/workshops.html We
aim to train biologists with little or no NGS experience
to prepare sequencing libraries and analyze the millions
of DNA sequences that result. Participants are expected
to provide DNA or RNA samples from their own study
systems, and we will prepare sequencing libraries to-
gether from those samples as well as a shared set of
samples for a group project.
Participants will learn to analyze these data themselves
using simple command line tools on a high-performance
computing cluster. We'll cover each step of the process
from DNA or RNA in a tube, to millions of DNA se-
quences, to biological data on gene expression or genetic
variation.
Registration for these workshops includes room and
board (three meals a day including plenty of cof-
fee and snacks) throughout the workshop, and
reagents/sequencing such that each participant can se-
quence and analyze a set of their own samples, generat-
ing pilot data for their species of interest.
Our Tag-Seq workshop will run from Aug 10-18, and
the 2bRAD workshop from Aug 18-26. Registration
for either workshop alone costs $1,900. Participants
enrolling in both workshops will pay a discounted rate
of $3,700 altogether.112 EvolDir May 1, 2018

BiodiversityBiogeography Jul2-6
The diversity of life on Earth (biodiversity) exhibits
temporal and spatial patterns calling for theoretical
interpretations. This ve-day course reviews several
theoretical approaches describing patterns of species
richness and relative abundance. The objective of this
course is to make participants familiar with these theo-
ries' rationales, assumptions and limitations.
A major goal of this course is to demystify the use of
mathematics in ecology. To this end, the course empha-
sizes the development and interpretation of mathemati-
cal formulae and their relationship with the biological
phenomena they describe. The course has a hands-on
approach, and participants will be engaged in computer
exercises using R that aim to illustrate and implement
the mathematical methods discussed. After the course
the attendants should have a newfound appreciation
for the role of theoretical models, with a view to be-
ing able to follow (and contribute to) advancements in
theoretical ecology.

EvolutionGeometricMorphometrics
Sep10-14
Dear evoldir memebers,
Transmitting Science is oering the 3rd edition of the
course 'STUDYING EVOLUTION WITH GEOMET-
RIC MORPHOMETRICS'.
Instructor: Chris Klingenberg (University of Manch-
ester, UK).
Dates: September 10th-14th, 2018.
Location: Heraklion, Crete (Greece)
Course overview
Morphometric approaches are used increasingly to study
a wide range of questions concerning the evolution of or-
ganismal shape and its developmental and genetic basis.
The standard techniques of the 'morphometric synthesis'
of the mid-1990s have been supplemented by a set of
new methods that address specic biological questions
in specic contexts such as morphological integration,
modularity,phylogenetic comparative analyses, and stud-
ies of symmetry and asymmetry. This course will introd
uce these recent approaches to an audience of researchers
who are familiar with the fundamentals of geometric
morphometrics. Lectures will present the theoretical
basis of the methods, and software demonstrations and
practical exercises will provide participants with the op-
portunity to try out the methods themselves. Practical
work, as far as possible with the participants' own data
or with data provided as examples, and discussions of
the participants' research questions are intended to help
them to apply the new methods to their own projects.
The course will be taught using the software MorphoJ.

EMBO Practical Course: http://meetings.embo.org/-
event/18-phylogenetics Tree building: Advanced con-
cepts and practice of phylogenetic analysis
24 - 29 September 2018, Faro, Portugal
*About the practical course*
The use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of molecular sequences is a vital
part of biological research. These methods underpin
studies on the evolution and epidemiology of plant and
animal parasites and disease-causing organisms, and
more generally they allow an objective analysis of the
patterns and processes generating biological diversity.
To carry out phylogenetic analysis properly, it is neces-
sary to have a good understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the key methods and approaches. This
EMBO Practical Course has been designed to provide
the theoretical and practical skills needed to carry out
state-of-the-art phylogenetic analyses.
The past few years have seen have an explosion in
new methods of analysis including the application of
Bayesian analysis methods in phylogeny reconstruction,
the development of improved non-homogeneous models
that much better represent the dynamics of sequence
evolution, and the development of methods for high-
throughput genome-wide analyses. This EMBO Practi-
cal Course has been designed to cater for these newest
of methods and for understanding how they relate to
the more traditional methods. Our goal is to teach
technical sophistication without losing sight of the need
for a critical attitude to data and analyses.

*Selection criteria*
Participants will be early-career postdoctoral researchers
and advanced PhD students who will be chosen on merit,as judged from a motivational letter, CV, and abstract

CRISPRCas9Applications Sep11
Dear colleagues,
during evolution, animals have conquered the most ex-
treme habitats and have evolved astonishing capabilities
and a fascinating diversity of forms. However, it has
remained a challenge to understand the genetic mecha-
nisms underlying many evolutionary phenomena because
functional genetic work has been restricted to a selected
number of well-established model organisms.
With modern molecular methods, many organisms are
now amenable to functional genetics: next generation
sequencing can reveal genome sequences and expression
proles and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools allow
the targeted precise modication of genomes.
When used together, these techniques allow for a
plethora of evolutionary questions to be addressed at
the genetic level. This workshop aims to foster the use
of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing in various
animal models.
In this workshop we want to bring together scientists
with experience in genome editing with those that wish
to apply this technique to study dierent evolutionary
and zoological questions. After some talks on the appli-
cation of the method you will have the opportunity to
discuss your project idea with our invited experts.
This meeting is a Satellite Symposium of the 111th An-
nual Meeting of the German Zoological Society (DZG)
organized by the \Fachgruppe Entwicklungsbiologie" of

Hannover SNPdata Jun11-14
Dear All
for those working with SNP data, I would like to draw
your attention to a four day workshop from June 11{
14,2018 on:
\SNP data management with TheSNPpit software pack-
age"
organized at the Institute of Farm Animal Genetics
(FLI) in Mariensee near Hannover/Germany and run
by Helmut Lichtenberg, Hermann Schwarzenbacher and
myself. The workshop will start on Monday afternoon
and nish on Thursday at noon.
TheSNPpit is a high performance database system for
managing large scale SNP data. (for detailed informa-
tion see: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=-
10.1371/journal.pone.0164043 )
The course is targeted at people needing to manage and
handle SNP data from whatever sources, be it plants
or mammals from any SNP array. Thus it is for re-
search institutions needing to keep track of many sets of
project SNP data, or breeding programs with large scale
genotyping with high density SNP chips and millions of
samples.
The course will cover everything from software instal-
lation to hands on use of TheSNPpit. Furthermore,
will shall deal with TheSNPpit integration into existing
pipelines.This will include programmatically querying
the SNP database as is, for instance, required when
doing parentage control for which running code will be
provided.
Other topics are user support, software maintenance and
further development of TheSNPpit also as user group
contributed software.
Course participants bring their Linux laptops together
with their own SNP data. After the workshop they will
be able to setup and manage their own SNP databases
be they limited in size or very large.
Accommodation will be available locally. There is no
course fee, but participants will have to pay for their
travel, accommodation and meals.
Registration deadline is April 19th (FCFS).

ForestTreeGenomics Jun4-7
Training course 'From genotypes to phenotypes: as-
sessing forest tree diversity in the wild' 4-7 June 2018
Kaunas, Lithuania
Assessing how genetic diversity at potentially adaptive
loci is structured in natural forest tree populations is a
complex matter. Demographic processes and natural se-
lection interact to produce genomic signatures that need
to be disentangled. Single nucleotide polymorphisms,
SNPs, are the most common type of genetic variation
among living organisms. Studies based on SNP geno-
typing in trees, in particular on variation underlying
adaptive traits, is an expanding research eld which will
help understand how trees adapt to climate change.
The course will show how genomic data sets can be
analyzed to yield information on how environmental fac-
tors shape local adaptation and how genomic variation
aect phenotypic diversity and how this can be used in
breeding programs.
Main topics of the course include: - Genomics: from
theory to practice - SNP genotyping - Statistical anal-
ysis of molecular data (methods and software) - High
throughput phenotyping for association studies - Mea-
suring and analyzing variability at potentially adaptive
genes.
The lectures are based on datasets, analyses and prelim-
inary results from research conducted within GenTree
project. The last day of the course will be spent in
the eld to acquire experience with drone-based phe-
notyping. Nice weather, beautiful forests and good
atmosphere are guaranteed!

September 2018
Full information available here: http://-
eower.myspecies.info/oakspringsummerschool
We invite applications for the Oak Spring eFLOWER
Summer School to be held at the Oak Spring Garden
Foundation in Upperville, Virginia (USA) from 18 to 27
September 2018. The goal of the Summer School is to
deliver high-quality training in the modern comparative
methods used to study plant macroevolution. While
the methods are general and applicable to any groupMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 119
of organisms, all of our empirical datasets will be
drawn from our recent work on owering plants. A
unique feature of this School will be that the students
themselves will participate in the creation of the
datasets (oral traits and fossil calibrations) in our
collaborative database PROTEUS, thereby gaining
hands-on experience of the problems and questions
associated with compiling data and building real-life
datasets for comparative analyses. In doing so, we
hope to further promote the rapidly evolving eld
of macroevolution among graduate students in plant
sciences, while also conveying our experience in building
high-quality datasets.
Topics addressed in the Summer School will include:
divergence time estimation using molecular dating meth-
ods (relaxed clock methods, fossil calibration), ancestral
state reconstruction and correlation of morphological
traits (using maximum likelihood and Bayesian meth-
ods), and diversication rates and state-dependent di-
versication. All of these approaches start with phylo-
genetic trees obtained from molecular or genomic data
and thus prior understanding of and experience with
phylogenetic reconstruction based on such data is an
essential prerequisite for participants, because this topic
will not be taught in the Summer School. We also plan
to include an outreach component in the form of a short
video made by the participants during the course, ex-
plaining in simple terms what they have learned and
why these methods are important to understand plant
evolution.
The Oak Spring eFLOWER Summer School is free (no
registration fee), including food and accommodation on
site. All participants will also receive up to US $1000
on a reimbursement basis for their economy ights to
Dulles Airport (IAD), Washington D.C. Participants
are entirely responsible for arranging their own travel
insurance and visas. The School is ideally suited to grad-
uate students (enrolled in a master's or PhD program)
who already have some botanical and phylogenetic back-
ground, but who lack training in current macroevolu-
tionary methods. International applicants are welcome
(but uency in English is a requirement of the course)
and we will attempt to achieve a good balance in terms
of gender and origin in the nal Summer School group
selected.
To apply, please send a one-page letter of motivation
and a CV, as a single PDF le with your name, to
herve.sauquet@gmail.com. Deadline for applications:
1st June, 2018. Decisions will be made by 18th June.
Please include the names and contact details of two
referees (e.g., current or previous supervisor), but no
letter of support (we will contact referees if necessary).
Applications that do not meet these requirements maybe automatically rejected. The total number of partici-
pants will be limited to 15.

Portugal ComparativeMethods
Jul23-25
Phylogenetic comparative methods are commonly used
nowadays to investigate how species diversication oc-
curs and test hypotheses about the mechanisms that
drive phenotypic evolution, e.g. to model speciation and
extinction, to understand why some groups are more
diverse than others, to test whether phenotypic traits
have evolved under neutral, directional or diversifying
selection, to investigate how evolutionary rates are mod-
ied across the evolutionary history of a group etc. In
all these cases, a phylogenetic hypothesis for the group
of interest is combined to phenotypic and ecological data
at the species level to understand the tempo and mode
of evolutionary change.
The objective of this course is to provide an overview
of these methods and of the tools available for their
implementation in the R statistical language. During120 EvolDir May 1, 2018
theoretical sessions, we will review the main concepts
and statistical tools necessary for testing hypotheses
about species diversication and phenotypic evolution.
These will then be implemented in practical lab sessions
through worked examples to provide the participants
with hands-on experience on data management and the
implementation of these methods to real biological data.
A good knowledge of basic operations in R (le import,
handling objects, using functions, getting help) is re-
quired and assumed to be able to adequately follow this
course. BIODIV students are encouraged to take the

The GTPB is proud to announce that the above refer-
enced hands-on training course is open for applications
Admission: Candidates with adequate prole will be
accepted in the next 72 hours after the application until
we reach 20 participants.
Course description: Genetic and genomic data are in-
creasingly used by ecologists and evolutionary biologists
in general. It has thus become important for many
biologists with dierent levels of experience to produce
and analyse genetic (and genomic) data. In this course
we will take a practical approach to the analysis of ge-
netic and genomic data, but we will also provide some
of the theoretical background required to understand
the outputs of the software used. This course will be
organised so as to mix lectures where important notions
are introduced with practicals where freely available
software will be used. While this will not be the focus ofMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 121
the course, we will also introduce and discuss genealog-
ical (coalescent-based) simulation methods and those
based on forward-in-time simulations. Altogether this
will allow to discuss the potentialities and limitations
of the tools available to the community.
In this ve-day course we will introduce the main con-
cepts that underlie many of the models that are fre-
quently used in population genetics. We will focus on
the importance of demographic history (e.g. eective
sizes and migration patterns) in shaping genetic data.
We will go through the basic notions that are central to
population genetics, insisting particularly on the statis-
tics used to measure genetic diversity and population
dierentiation. The course will also cover a short in-
troduction to coalescent theory, Bayesian inference in
population genetics and data simulation. We will also
introduce methods that have been recently developed to
analyse genomic data such as the PSMC method of Li
and Durbin that reconstructs the demographic history
of a species or population with the genome of a single
individual.
Most theory will be put into practice in practical ses-
sions, analyzing real and/or simulated datasets. In these
sessions, we will look at measures of genetic diversity and
dierentiation and use methods to infer demographic
history. We will learn how to perform coalescent simu-
lations of genetic/genomic data (using mainly Richard
Hudson's ms program). We will also show how to simu-
late data for PSMC analyses. This will allow users to
compare the PSMC obtained with real data to those
obtained for the models they used. We will also look at
how habitat fragmentation can be simulated using an
in-house program. Some exercises will make use of R
scripts (R being a freely available statistical program).
Basic R knowledge is a pre-requisite but we will provide
a short introduction to R. The R statistical package
is a very powerful tool to analyse data outputs from
many population genetics software, and can also be
used to simulate genetic data under simple demographic
scenarios.

Introduction to Linux workows for biologists (IBUL03)
This course will take place from the 1st - 5th October
2018 in Glasgow city and centre and will be delivered by
Dr Martin Jones. You can subscribe to just the course
and/or add an additional accommodation package in
out near by accommodation for ease which included
breakfast lunch and dinner on Monday and Thursday.
Course Overview:
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lift-
ing { genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation
tools { are designed to work best when used with a
command-line interface. Because the command line can
be an intimidating environment, many biologists learnthe bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools
working. This means that they miss out on the power
of Linux to customize their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.
Monday 1st
Module 1: The design of Linux.
In the rst session we briey cover the design of Linux:
how is it dierent from Windows/OSX and how is it
best used? We'll then jump straight onto the command
line and learn about the layout of the Linux le system
and how to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's le per-
mission system (which often trips up beginners), how
paths work, and how we actually run programs on the
command line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the
command line more eciently, and how to deal with
programs that are misbehaving. We'll nish this session
by looking at the built in help system and how to read
and interpret manual pages.
Module 2: System management. We'll rst look at a
few command line tools for monitoring the status of
the system and keeping track of what's happening to
processor power, memory, and disk space. We'll go over
the process of installing new software from the built in
repositories (which is easy) and from source code down-
loads (which is trickier). We'll also introduce some tools
for benchmarking software (measuring the time/memory
requirements of processing large datasets).
Tuesday 2nd
Module 3: Manipulating tabular data. Many data types
we want to work with in bioinformatics are stored as
tabular plain text les, and here we learn all about
manipulating tabular data on the command line. We'll
start with simple things like extracting columns, lter-
ing and sorting, searching for text before moving on to
more complex tasks like searching for duplicated values,
summarizing large les, and combining simple tools into
long commands.
Module 4: Constructing pipelines. In this session we
will look at the various tools Linux has for constructing
pipelines out of individual commands. Aliases, shell
redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will all be intro-
duced here. We'll also look at a couple of specic tools
to help with running tools on multiple processors, and
for monitoring the progress of long running tasks.
Wednesday 3rd
Module 5: EMBOSS. EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformat-124 EvolDir May 1, 2018
ics command-line tools explicitly designed to work in the
Linux paradigm. We'll get an overview of the dierent
sequence data formats that we might expect to work
with, and put what we learned about shell scripting to
biological use by building a pipeline to compare codon
usage across two collections of DNA sequences.
Module 6: - Using a Linux server. Often in bioinfor-
matics we'll be working on a Linux server rather than
our own computer{ typically because we need access
to more computing power, or to specialized tools and
datasets. In this session we'll learn how to connect to
a Linux server and how to manage sessions. We'll also
consider the various ways of moving data to and from
a server from your own computer, and nish with a
discussion of the considerations we have to make when
working on a shared computer.
Thursday 4th
Module 7: Combining methods. In the next two ses-
sions { i.e. one full day { we'll put everything we have
learned together and implement a workow for next-
gen sequence analysis. In this rst session we'll carry
out quality control on some paired-end Illumina data
and map these reads to a reference genome. We'll then
look at various approaches to automating this pipeline,
allowing us to quickly do the same for a second dataset.
Module 18: Combining methods. The second part of the
next-gen workow is to call variants to identify SNPs be-
tween our two samples and the reference genome. We'll
look at the VCF le format and gure out how to lter
SNPs for read coverage and quality. By counting the
number of SNPs between each sample and the reference
we will try to gure out something about the biology
of the two samples. We'll attempt to automate this
analysis

Introduction to Python for biologists (IPYB05)
Delivered by Dr. Martin Jones
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-to-
python-for-biologi sts-ipyb05/
Course Overview:
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
It gives an overview of the language with an emphasis
on practical problem-solving, using examples and exer-
cises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics work.
After completing the workshop, students should be in
a position to (1) apply the skills they have learned to
tackle problems in their own research and (2) continue
their Python education in a self-directed way. In biol-
ogy Python is often applied to sequence analysis and
data manipulation e.g. calculating base composition
statistics, removing adapter sequences, translating DNA
to protein, counting kmers, ltering tables etc. In this
course we use these applications as examples during
the exercises as a way of illustrating how to use theMay 1, 2018 EvolDir 125
tools that Python has because it makes sense given the
background of most of the people who attend. However,
it should be possible to apply what you learn to any
type of programming problem.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.May 1, 2018 EvolDir 127
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
