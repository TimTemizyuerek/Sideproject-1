Conference web site http://www.lirmm.fr/MIEP08/
Theme
The subject is evolution, which is considered at diﬀer-
ent scales: sequences, genes, gene families, organelles,
genomes, and species. The focus is on the mathemati-
cal and computational tools and concepts, which form
an essential basis of evolutionary studies. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress in this area, with models
becoming more realistic, and complex, and with fast
algorithms able to deal with the large datasets that are
available today.
Non-exhaustive list of topics: phylogenetics, evolu-
tionary genetics and genomics, molecular evolution of
pathogens and epidemiology, biodiversity, statistical
modelling, algorithmics, and software development.
The program will include short talks (typically 20 min-
utes) and plenty of time for discussions. If you are
planning to attend, you have to register on this web
site. As the number of attendees will be limited, we
recommend registering quickly, and to submit a title
and abstract if you are willing to talk. Poster sessions
will be organized if we have too many propositions.
This conference is a continuation of:

Framework:
The “environment” of parasites is made of many dif-
ferent types of factors. First, the genotype of the host
itself produces the background of the parasite’s devel-
opment. Moreover, the interactions between host and
parasite genotypes (i.e. GxG interactions) can result
in the shared control of their traits. Finally, as for any
type of organism, other biotic and abiotic factors, oc-
curring inside and outside the host, can aﬀect the trans-
lation of genotypic variations into phenotypes. Such
sensu stricto environmental factors add another layer
of complexity to the determinism of phenotypes as they
can aﬀect the interactions between host and parasite
genotypes¨ ı¿1
2leading to GxGxE interactions. The num-
ber of “statistically signiﬁcant” environmental factors
(e.g. temperature, within host competitors, GxG inter-
actions¨ ı¿1
2) never stops growing. But how important
they are remains obscure. Planning:
The presentations will be followed by two general dis-
cussions on:
Morning: The coevolutionary process and what vari-
ability studies tell us of evolution in dynamic environ-
ments Afternoon: Integrating environmental ﬂuctua-
tions into mathematical models of host and parasite
evolution.

son of diﬀerent methods. We particularly invite pro-
posals based on this data set. Successful submis-
sions for this project will be published in a special
supplement by BMC Genetics and participating stu-
dents and postdocs (limited to one per group, 5 in
total) will qualify for a reduced conference fee. For
more preliminary information, please visit our website:

Dear Colleagues
Registration deadline (the 20th of November) for the
PopGroup2007 is approaching. This year the 41st Pop-
ulation Genetics Group meeting UK (PopGroup)will be
held at the University of Warwick Conference Centre
(United Kingdom) 17th to 20th of December 2007.
Please visit the conference website www.popgroup.org
for more information & registration. The cost of the
meeting is 290 UK pounds including fees, accommoda-
tion and meals.
PopGroup is a fairly informal meeting, which brings
together ~200 scientists working in population genet-
ics and evolutionary biology, from the UK, Europe and
more remote and exotic places, such as North Amer-
ica and Australia. All areas of evolutionary biology are
covered.
Warwick conference centre is located very close to
Birmingham International airport. It is also only about
two hours by coach from London Heathrow Airport.
It is easily accessible by rail, and by car (see travel
information and maps on the website). It is also a
great place for those interested in sightseeing: historic
Warwick Castle and Stratford-upon-Avon, the birth-
place of William Shakespeare are withing half an hour
drive from the conference centre (e.g. see http://-
www.stratford-upon-avon.co.uk/ ).

Winchester ArtiﬁcialLife Aug5-8CALL FOR PAPERS: Artiﬁcial Life XI
The Eleventh International Conference on the Simula-
tion and Synthesis of Living Systems 5th - 8th August
2008, Winchester, UK www.alifexi.org Artiﬁcial life in-
vestigates the fundamental properties of living systems
through simulating and synthesizing biological entities
and processes in artiﬁcial media. Summer 2008 will see
the international ALife conference hosted by the Uni-
versity of Southampton, UK, bringing the meeting to
Europe for the ﬁrst time in its 21-year history. Over the
last two decades, some of the highly speculative ideas
that were discussed at the ﬁeld’s inception have ma-
tured to the extent that new conferences and journals
devoted to them are being established:
synthesising artiﬁcial cells, simulating massive biologi-
cal networks, exploiting biological substrates for com-
putation and control, and deploying bio-inspired engi-
neering are all now cutting-edge practice.
The ALife XI conference provides an opportunity for
those working across these topics to get together and
exchange ideas and results.
To this end, the conference will present a selection of
the best current work in the ﬁeld, highlight new direc-
tions for investigation, and present high-proﬁle keynote
speakers.
Papers are welcome in all areas of the ﬁeld, including:
Synthesis and origin of life, self-organization Self-
replication, artiﬁcial chemistries Evolution and adap-
tation, evolutionary dynamics Evolutionary games, co-
evolution Development, diﬀerentiation, and regula-
tion Generative representations Synthetic biology Self-
organizing technology, self-* computing Computational
ecosystems Unconventional and biologically inspired
computing Bio-inspired robots and embodied cogni-
tion Autonomous agents, evolutionary robotics Col-
lective behavior, communication, cooperation Artiﬁcial
consciousness; the relationship between life and mind
Philosophical, ethical, and cultural implications Math-
ematical and philosophical foundations of ALife New
and creative syntheses
All authors are encouraged to explain how their work
sheds light on the fundamental properties of living sys-
tems and makes progress on the important open ques-
tions identiﬁed at previous meetings.
The conference will be held in Winchester, a beautiful
historic city in southern England known for its 11th-
century cathedral and 12th-century castle. Winchester
is set in forested countryside about an hour southwest
of London and Heathrow airport, and a few miles from
the host institution, the University of Southampton.8 EvolDir December 1, 2007

Dear Colleagues
Please be advised of the commencement for planning a
new deep sea research program, Deep Ocean Australia,
in the southwest Paciﬁc and eastern Indian Ocean (sub-
stantially but not exclusively in proximity to Australian
territorial waters), commencing later in 2008. Details
can be found at the following website, www.uq.edu.au/10 EvolDir December 1, 2007
deepoceanaustralia, (please be patient as the site is new
and still under development).
Major research topics include biodiversity and biodis-
covery, taxonomy, evolution, genetics, physiology, neu-
robiology, behaviour and history of deep-sea inverte-
brates and vertebrates.
As part of the funding from the Australian Research
Council (ARC), the industry partner Deep Ocean Quest
and others there will be up to 12 PhD scholarships
including at least 4 Australian Postgraduate Awards
(APAs) available to both Australian national and in-
ternational applicants.
Project topics might include the following, depending
on supervisor and institution:
- Connectivity and biodiversity between isolated habi-
tats - “Living fossils” and evolution in the deep sea -
Present and past deep-sea communities and the eﬀect
of a changing climate? - Physiological adaptations of
deep-sea inhabitants, with particular emphasis on sen-
sory biology - Genetics and biodiscovery of the deep-
sea? - Descriptions and quantiﬁcation of the unde-
scribed taxa in Australian deep-waters? - Conservation
and management of Australia’s deep-sea assets
The majority of the projects will be based at The
University of Queensland, Australia. Enrolment at
other Australian universities is also possible as well
as potential placements in New Zealand, USA, UK,
Sweden and Germany. Access to specimens is pro-
vided through funded expeditions on a research ves-
sel with deep-sea trawling, capture and ﬁlming capa-
bilities based around three observation and collection
submarines. Archival specimens will also be accessible
through our deep-sea investigator network. For more

We oﬀer a two-year research-intensive Masters pro-
gram wherein students are supported by teaching as-
sistantships and full tuition waivers. This is an ideal
program for undergrads who are thinking about grad-
uate schools but may not be quite ready to apply to
a high- proﬁle Ph.D. program or are looking for broad
training in ecology and related ﬁelds for work in con-
sulting or resource management.
With a low student to faculty ratio (approximately 8-
10 new students each year with 23 full-time faculty),
we can oﬀer an intimate and highly personalized re-
search and education experience rarely attainable at
larger universities. Also, our graduate students often
work closely with and mentor undergraduates, oﬀering
numerous informal teaching and personal development
opportunities.

DukeU DiseaseModeling
If you are interested in using quantitative approaches to
study the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases,
please feel free to contact me by e-mail. I am looking for
one to two graduate students to start next fall (August
2008) and the following one (August 2009).
I am speciﬁcally interested in students who think in-
novatively and preferably have some background in
theoretical biology (ideally ecology and/or evolution-
ary biology). Although undergraduate degrees in math
or computer science are not necessary, the candidate
must already possess or feel extremely comfortable in
developing quantitative skills. Main research projects
in my lab currently focus on (1) understanding the
role of climate variability in driving disease dynamics,
(2) developing mathematical and statistical models to
understand the disease dynamics of rapidly evolving
pathogens such as inﬂuenza and dengue, (3) drawing
quantitative comparisons between the ecological and
evolutionary patterns of rapidly evolving pathogens at
the population level versus at the within-host level.
Although most of this research has focused on bacte-
rial and viral pathogens that infect humans, current
projects are also considering the ecological and evo-
lutionary dynamics of pathogens in other hosts (e.g.,
avian and equine hosts).
Individuals interested in joining my lab should gener-
ally be interested in one or more of the research topics
listed above. I expect incoming graduate students to
be excited about their research, to be able to synthe-
size and incorporate material from diﬀerent ﬁelds, in-
cluding ecology, evolution, virology, applied math, andepidemiology. Most importantly, graduate students of
mine should see infectious diseases as providing a great
model system to quantitatively study open questions in
ecology and evolutionary biology.
Beyond the important interactions that grad students
will have with ecologists and evolutionary biologists in
the Department of Biology, there are also many other
resources at Duke that a student studying infectious
diseases with me could tap into. Speciﬁcally, Duke is
home to a recently founded Global Health Institute,
a Theoretical Immunology group, a Vaccine Institute,
and a Center for Nonlinear and Complex Systems. My
lab has established collaborations with several of these
groups, and is looking to further these ties. Further-
more, NESCent, UNC-Chapel Hill, and NC State are
all within half an hour of Duke University, creating a
larger academic community in the Triangle Region.

the National Institutes of Health has awarded the De-
partment of Genetics an Institutional Research Train-
ing Grant for predoctoral training in “The Genetic Ar-
chitecture of Quantitative Traits.”
Quantitative, or complex, traits are aﬀected by multi-
ple interacting genes, each of which have small eﬀects
and are sensitive to the environment. Understanding
the molecular nature of genetic variation for quantita-
tive traits will have an enormous impact on medicine,
livestock and crop breeding, and the study of evolution.
For over half a century North Carolina State University
has been a leading center for research in quantitative
genetics. To enable future scientists to advance our un-
derstanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative
traits, we oﬀer a research and training program that in-
tegrates quantitative, population, molecular and devel-
opmental genetics, statistics and molecular evolution.

PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS
One PhD position in evolutionary genetics is available
at the Department of Biology, NTNU, Norway. The fel-
lowship is for up to four years including 25 % teaching
duties. The fellowship is linked to the Centre for Con-
servation Biology, NTNU ( http://www.bio.ntnu.no/-
pbc/), and the research group of Dr Jon Slate, Dept.
of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheﬃeld
(http://www.jon-slate.staﬀ.shef.ac.uk/ ).
The Department of Biology, NTNU, has 34 members
of faculty (professors and associate professors), 10 re-
search scientists and about 65 PhD students and post
docs. The department incorporates research programs
in evolutionary biology, population genetics, aquatic
and terrestrial ecology, conservation biology and biodi-
versity, ethology, molecular biology, cell biology, plant
and animal physiology and ecophysiology, aquacul-
ture, and marine biology, with considerable collabora-
tion between the disciplines. More information about
the Department of Biology can be found at: http://-
www.bio.ntnu.no/eng/ .
The purpose of the project is to study the genetic
mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution of complex
traits in natural populations. This will be done using
state-of-the-art genomics analyses combined with ad-
vanced statistical methods. Empirical data has already
been collected from artiﬁcial selection experiments car-
ried out in two natural bird populations. The data
are available in a bio-bank which contains information
and DNA samples from 1800 individual house sparrows
(Passer domesticus) distributed across four generations
in genetically determined pedigrees. The PhD project
will combine high-throughput genotyping of individu-
als in the pedigrees on single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and data in the bio-bank to carry out QTL
mapping of complex phenotypic traits. The QTL maps
will be used to examine 1) how the genetic architecture
of complex phenotypic traits inﬂuence the rate and di-
rection of evolutionary changes caused by selection, and
2) how the genome changes as a result of selection of18 EvolDir December 1, 2007
known strength and direction. Through these analyses
the project will increase the general understanding of
the genomic changes underlying adaptive evolutionary
processes.
The student will through the PhD acquire expertise in
cutting-edge genomics techniques and advanced statis-
tical methods used in an evolutionary population genet-
ics framework. Thus, the student will have the ability
to pursue further research in a wide range of growing
ﬁelds of research.
Applicants must have, or soon expect to obtain, a
MSc/Cand.Scient. (or equivalent) degree in the ﬁeld
of evolutionary biology, molecular ecology, functional
genomics, molecular biology, mathematics/statistics or
bioinformatics. Ability to carry out goal-oriented work,
ability to deliver, oral and written presentation of re-
search results, and good co-operation abilities will be
emphasized.

QueenMaryU MolecularClocks
Dissecting the causes of rate variation in the molecular
clock PhD Student Scholarship at Queen Mary Univer-
sity of London (Sept 2008 for 4 years)
This position is open to students from all countries.
The Scholarship covers fees and living expenses, but it
will require you to do limited lab teaching (demonstrat-
ing).
The molecular clock hypothesis proposes that evolution
at the sequence level occurs at a more-or-less constant
rate. This hypothesis is demonstrably false: for exam-
ple, the rate of substitution in coral mitochondrial DNA
is a hundred-fold slower than other animals. Yet such
glaring counter-examples are swept aside with disturb-
ing alacrity when the clock is used to draw inferences
about the action of selection, or evolutionary history.
The genomic data that have recently accumulated pro-
vide an exciting and unexploited opportunity to inves-
tigate the fundamental evolutionary processes aﬀecting
such variation, because sequences from multiple loci can
now be obtained from many species. The student will
be equipped with computational skills and the theoret-
ical understanding to contribute to this essential ﬁeld
of post-genomic science.
It will suit a student interested in evolutionary biology,
and, while programming skills are not a prerequisite,
a reasonably sophisticated familiarity with computers
and a willingness to learn basic programming skills are
essential. The results of this project will overcome fun-
damental obstacles to the use of molecular clock tech-
niques in studies ranging from gene function to bio-
geography. More importantly the project will generate
novel insights into the fundamental processes of molec-
ular evolution.Applications are invited from candidates with, or ex-
pecting to obtain, at least an upper-second class hon-
ours degree in an area relevant to the project. Ap-
plicants should send a CV and the names and con-
tact details of two academic referees to James Cotton
(j.a.cotton@qmul.ac.uk) by 1st of February 2008

SocialEvolution
Applications are invited from students interested in car-
rying out a Ph.D. thesis on the evolutionary genet-
ics and ecology of mating systems and social evolu-
tion at Queens College, at the City University of New
York (CUNY). My group studies the evolution of re-
productive strategies, phenotypic diversity, and varia-
tion in the genetic structure of populations in social
animals, and is particularly interested in how selection
on mating strategies aﬀects social evolution and vice
versa.We apply a variety of techniques to address these
topics, including ﬁeld studies, molecular genetic analy-
ses, laboratory experiments, and comparative analyses
using social insects as test systems. Excellent facilities
are available for this work in my laboratory, in addi-
tion to a very well-equipped Core laboratory. Also,
the Ecology-Evolution-Behavior faculty at Queens Col-
lege, composed of six groups, constitutes a dynamical,
driven, and stimulating environment with a strong fo-
cus on all aspects of evolutionary genetics. Succesful
candidates will receive generous support in the form of
fellowships, health care, and free tuition, and will have
only moderate teaching assistantship duties. Candi-
dates must have keen interests in evolutionary genetics
and ecology, population biology, or behavioral ecology.
Prior research experience is a plus but not necessary,
and a strong academic record is required. Candidates
of any nationality are eligible. Having a Master?s de-
gree is not required, but Master?s level courses will be
credited toward the Ph.D. work.

UAlaska SelfIncompatibility
We currently have NSF funding for an MS or PhD level
student to work on the evolution of self-incompatibility
genes in poppies (Papaveraceae) at the University of
Alaska.
The ideal student for this project will either have molec-
ular lab skills (such as DNA sequencing), and/or data
analysis skills (math, computer, coalescence theory).
However, all high-quality students with an interest
in evolutionary genetics are encouraged to apply for
Spring or Fall admission.
Alaska oﬀers unparalleled beauty, untouched land-
scapes, and unique research opportunities, as well as
an extreme climate and unique culture. Research at
UA includes topics such as adaptations to our extreme
climate, the unique evolutionary history of organisms
inﬂuenced by glacial cycles and migrations from both
North American and Asia, climate change, how interac-
tions among species inﬂuence community composition.
The goal of the project is to sequence and identify self-
incompatibility alleles from the genus Papaver, and in-
vestigate the patterns of molecular evolution at this lo-
cus. Students will also be encouraged to develop their
own interests in areas related to this project. For in-
stance, investigating the number of self-incompatibility
alleles and mate availability in Papaver species with
diﬀerent evolutionary histories. There are several rare
(federally listed) poppy species in Alaska which are
not found elsewhere in North America, and there is
likely to be interesting conservation work that can be
done on these species, such as investigating their self-
incompatibility status and ability to ﬁnd mates, lev-
els of genetic diversity, and their divergence from east-
ern Russian populations, and relationships to other
Beringian poppies. There are also opportunities for de-
veloping theory on the evolution of self-incompatibility
genes.

UCambridge Butterﬂy
BioinformaticsEvoDevo
Applicants are encouraged for a PhD studentship(s)
in the Butterﬂy Genetics Group at the Uni-
versity of Cambridge to begin in October 2008
funded by the Leverhulme Trust (see http:// helico-
nius.zoo.cam.ac.uk/pg opps.php). The following are
possible research areas:
1) Colour pattern genetics and Evo-Devo
We are interested in the genetic and developmental ba-
sis of colour pattern evolution in Heliconius butterﬂies.
Heliconius oﬀer exciting opportunities in this ﬁeld be-
cause they have bold patterns with known function in
the wild and which show huge diversity between closely
related populations. Mimicry is also common, whereby
relatively distantly related lineages converge on a com-
mon pattern - in eﬀect independent evolutionary exper-
iments. We have obtained some exciting data showing
that the same genes control patterns in diﬀerent lin-
eages - see Joron et al., (2006). This oﬀers exciting
opportunities for comparative projects to discover how
just a few genes can control both divergent and con-26 EvolDir December 1, 2007
vergent patterns. The important thing to note here is
that we are studying very recent evolutionary novelty
(unlike much of the evo-devo literature on traits like
body plan) - so are much closer in time to the key evo-
lutionary changes.
Possible projects include 1) transcriptome microar-
ray analysis of expression patterns during develop-
ment of wing patterns in diﬀerent races of Heliconius
melpomene. 2) Development and application of novel
techniques for gene manipulation during wing develop-
ment to investigate candidate genes for colour pattern
control loci, such as transfection of developing wings
with gene transcripts or RNAi gene knockdown. 3)
Linkage mapping of pattern loci that have not been
studied to date, such as the H. melpomene Ac locus,
and QTL analysis of genes of minor eﬀect.
2) Bioinformatics
We are generating large amounts of both genome
and transcript sequence data for diﬀerent Heliconius
species (see www.butterﬂybase.org ). Genome informa-
tion from closely related species oﬀers exciting oppor-
tunities for comparative analysis and especially identi-
ﬁcation of evolutionary patterns in sequence evolution
(see recent Nature paper, Nov 2007 on 12 Drosophila
genomes for an example of this on a massive scale!).
Here we are particularly interested in transcriptome se-
quence data from developing wings and its relevance to
colour pattern evolution.
Possible projects involving analysis of these data in-
clude 1) comparisons of synteny across the Lepidoptera
taking advantage of both newly available resources
for Bombyx mori and our own data which include a
ﬁngerprinted and end-sequenced BAC library for H.
melpomene. 2) Developing assembly and annotation
tools for data sets combining novel short “454” se-
quence reads with traditional Sanger sequence. 3) Com-
parative analysis of multi-species data sets that will
soon be available for Heliconius melpomene, H. er-
ato and H. numata to identify Heliconius-speciﬁc tran-
scripts and fast-evolving genes. We are keen that this
analysis would be carried out in conjunction with de-
velopment of the ButterﬂyBase web server where our
data are made publicly available.
What to do If you are interested then you
should ﬁrst get in touch with me (Chris Jiggins,
c.jiggins@zoo.cam.ac.uk) and send: (1) CV. (2) Details
of 2 or 3 Referees - also ask them to email me their
references. (3) A cover letter describing your interests,
and what you would like to work on.
Please note closing dates for application to the univer-
sity. Students from the EU and Overseas must sendtheir applications to the Board by 21 December 2007
at the latest.

UEastAnglia MHCevolution
The role of pathogens in promoting genetic variation
and diﬀerentiation in wild animals: a study on Berth-
elot’s pipits.
PhD Studentship at UEA, starting October 2008
Supervisor: Dr. DS Richardson (and Dr. JC Illera,
IPNA-CSIC, Canary Islands).
Vertebrate MHC genes code for molecules that bind
pathogens and trigger an immune reaction. They are
the most variable genes known but we are far from un-
derstanding the evolutionary processes that generate
this variation. Pathogen mediated selection plays a ma-
jor role, but the nature and extent of this remains un-
clear. The concept that ﬂuctuating selection can drive
MHC variation has received theoretic support, but has
been overlooked empirically. The basis of the hypoth-
esis is that temporal and geographical variation will
occur in the pathogens that a population faces, result-
ing in ﬂuctuations in the selection exerted. However,
no studies have measured diﬀerences in the pathogen
regime faced by diﬀerent populations of a species in or-
der to investigate the eﬀect it has upon the MHC. The
aim of this PhD is to determine the spatio-temporal
patterns of MHC in relation to diﬀerences in pathogen
exposure across 12 isolated populations of Berthelot’s
pipit (Anthus berthelotii) in the Macaronesian islands
to investigate this. This species provides an excellent
system of demarked populations undergoing incipient
diﬀerentiation with known diﬀerences in the pathogens
occurring in each population. The project will also
allow important questions relating to the impact of
pathogens and the evolution of disease resistance in
wild populations to be explored. Investigations of other
behavioural and ecological diﬀerences between the pop-
ulations may also be incorporated.
We are looking for an enthusiastic and dedicated stu-
dent interested in evolutionary and molecular ecology
(and ornithology). Fieldwork (3 months/year) will in-December 1, 2007 EvolDir 27
volve catching birds across all islands, and while there
is local support (Dr. JC Illera) the student must be
able to work independently. The student will use var-
ious molecular techniques to measure genetic varia-
tion within and among populations and to screen the
pathogens that infect pipits. Although not essential,
molecular lab experience will be an advantage, as will
experience in handling birds and good organisational
skills.

One PhD student positionat the Department of Biol-
ogy, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.Recent studies-
suggest that Sir Francis Bacons 400 years old maxim
Knowledge is power holdstrue also in the rest of theanimal kingdom. Many animals, such as insects,birds
and mammals, have been shown to gather information
in order to betteranticipate future environmental con-
ditions and to optimise own behaviour.However, very
little is still known how animals gather and use infor-
mation, howprevalent it is among animals, and what
implications it has to individuals,populations and com-
munities. Further, our recent studies indicate thatin-
formation transfer can occur also between species and
this novel theme isjust awaiting exploration.This four
year project,funded by the Academy of Finlad, aims to
examine how birds acquire and use informationderived
from nest predators and competing species. The theme
of the PhD projectis negotiable, but the major part of
the work is expected to focus on sociallearning between
species.Interspecﬁcinformation usage and social learn-
ingCulturalevolution in humans is based on social learn-
ing V non-genetic transmission ofacquired information
across individuals and generations. Our recent study-
suggests that social learning can take place between
species as well. Hence, canbehavioral traits transfer be-
tween species and emerge local traditions? Howdoes it
aﬀect species interactions and coexistence?Interspeciﬁc
sociallearning and above questions will be examined us-
ing resident (Parus spp.) andmigrant (Ficedula spp.)
birds as model organisms. This newly discoveredphe-
nomena will be examined by ﬁeld experiments in which
apparent nest-sitepreference of resident birds is manip-
ulated by abstract symbols, and thesubsequent choices
of ﬂycatchers are measured. Field work will take place
onGotland. The ultimate aim is to study whether the
non-genetic transmission oﬁnformation via social learn-
ing shares the same attributes as geneticevolution. Part
of the studies will be done in collaboration with Dr.

PhD position in evolutionary biology
One PhD position is available at the Department of
Evolutionary Biology in Uppsala, under the supervision
of Dr. Anders G¨ otherstr¨ om. The overall proﬁle of the
group is analysis of the spread of agriculture, anthro-
pogenic control over domesticates, human demography,
and how these events have shaped present day genetic
patterns in humans and animals living close to humans.
There are several possibilities for research projects and
the precise line of research will be discussed and de-
cided together with the successful applicant, depending
on his/her background and interest. Together with col-
leagues in Madrid, Burgos, and London, our group is
exploring the early stages of cattle domestication, and
the eﬀect of historic cattle breeding. Together with col-
leagues in Link¨ oping, we make intense investigation of
modern contamination and the problem it causes for
ancient DNA work on human remains. The studies
aim to ﬁnding suitable methods for retrieving authen-
tic ancient human DNA. Finally, in collaboration with
colleagues in Copenhagen, Penn State, and in Berke-
ley, we are investigating beneﬁts with new sequencing
technologies in ancient DNA typing. The coming years
will therefore be devoted to integrating these diﬀerent
branches, studying human controlled animals and hu-
mans with ancient DNA typed with new technologies.
Swedish PhD positions are for 4 years and are paid
throughout the studies. The Department of Evolution-
ary Biology ( http://www.egs.uu.se/evbiol/index.html )
is situated in the Evolutionary Biology Centre in cen-
tral Uppsala and is equipped with facilities for sequenc-
ing, genotyping and expression analysis. The work-
ing atmosphere is international with English as work-

UppsalaU PlantEvolution
Two PhD student positions in Plant Ecology at the
Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University
Two PhD student positions in Plant Ecology are avail-
able at the Department of Ecology and Evolution, Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University in the
projects described below. The successful candidates
will settle the exact proﬁles of their PhD projects to-
gether with their supervisors.
1. Land use, genetic diﬀerentiation and viability of
plant populations
A central goal of conservation biology is to maintain
species diversity, but also genetic diversity within and
among populations. Genetic diﬀerentiation in morphol-
ogy and life history characters has been documented
among local populations of a large number of plant
species, but in most cases it is not clear to what ex-
tent such diﬀerentiation is adaptive, and what selective
factors maintain adaptive diﬀerentiation.
In this project, we will examine factors maintaining ge-
netic variation in morphology and life history, and how
genetic composition inﬂuences the long-term viabilityDecember 1, 2007 EvolDir 35
of populations of the morphologically variable peren-
nial herb Primula farinosa. We will use a combination
of ﬁeld experiments, genetic analyses, and demographic
studies to explore the eﬀects of abiotic conditions and
land use on intensity of biotic interactions, selection
regime, and population diﬀerentiation in plant mor-
phology and life history. The results will be of funda-
mental interest for an understanding of processes main-
taining adaptive diﬀerentiation in natural populations.
The main part of the ﬁeldwork will be conducted on the
island of ¨Oland. The Ph.D. student will join a research
team, which also includes Prof. Johan Ehrl´ en and a
new Ph.D. student at Stockholm University.
The successful candidate should have a keen interest in
population biology, and ideally experience from previ-
ous work in population ecology or population genetics.

2. Self-incompatibility and plant reproductive success
Reproduction is the ultimate goal of the organism and
the trait on which selection ultimately acts. Crucial
to reproduction in outbreeding species is not only to
have other members of the species available but also
that these are possible as partners (a group of only
females cannot reproduce). The perennial herb Ara-
bidopsis lyrata, is incapable of self fertilisation (self-
incompatible) and thus dependent on other members
of the species for reproduction. The self-incompatibility
is determinde by a gene complex and individuals that
share S genotypes are incompatible with each other.
This gives a plant with a rare S-genotype more poten-
tial partners and a reproductive advantage to plants
with common genotypes. This frequency-dependent se-
lection leads to a high genetic diversity at the S locus
and old alleles shared across species boundaries. Within
the project diﬀerent aspects of self-incompatibility and
reproductive success, in particular male reproductive
success, will be studied. Possible questions to address
include: How will a plant’s reproductive success depend
on its S genotype? How are S alleles distributed within
and between populations? What is the dynamics of S
alleles over time? A. lyrata oﬀers good opportunities for
molecular genetic studies and grows naturally in Swe-
den along the High Coast. The project will include both
ﬁeld studies and molecular genetic laboratory work.
The successful candidate should have a keen interest in
population biology, and ideally previous experience in
population ecology and population genetics.

Uppsala University hereby declares the following posi-
tion to be open for application:
PhD student position
at the Department of Evolutionary Functional Ge-
nomics
One PhD position is available at the Department of
Evolutionary Functional Genomics at Uppsala Univer-
sity starting spring 2008. The department is part of
the Evolutionary Biology Centre, EBC. A major focus
of the department is the genetic basis of plant adap-
tation, combining information on gene function from
model organisms with studies of variation in adaptive
traits in diﬀerent species. The aim is to identify genes
that aﬀect variation in traits such as ﬂowering time and
growth rhythm. Our strategy is to integrate traditional36 EvolDir December 1, 2007
ecological and phylogeographic studies with genomics
and population genetics, at both theoretical and ex-
perimental levels. For more information: <http://-
www.genetik.uu.se/ >http://www.genetik.uu.se/
The successful applicant will take part in a project on
evolutionary and functional genomics of adaptive traits
in Norway spruce (Picea abies). The timing of budset
in Norway spruce is a trait with high adaptive value
and is also important for tree breeding. Quantitative
genetic studies have revealed a strong clinal variation
for this trait and a large part of the variation is un-
der genetic control. The aim of the present project is
to identify the genes that control the adaptive clinal
variation for this trait.
Our general strategy is to combine functional studies
of already identiﬁed candidate genes in Norway spruce
and model species with association mapping experi-
ments on the same genes in Norway spruce. Methods
include analysis of DNA sequence variation, SNP geno-
typing and QTL and association mapping, gene expres-
sion studies and transformation of Norway spruce and
Arabidopsis. The current project will mainly focus on
association mapping and evolutionary analysis of can-
didate genes. The work will be conducted within a re-
search group of currently 5 persons with both national
(SLU) and international (Canada, Italy) cooperation.
The student will be part of a large newly funded Euro-
pean project.
We are looking for an applicant with a strong interest
in population and evolutionary genetics. A Bachelor
of Science or equivalent in molecular biology, genomics,
genetics, or a related subject is required and experi-
ence in molecular genetics (for example DNA sequenc-
ing, QTL mapping), bioinformatics and statistics is an
advantage.
The application should include curriculum vitae, de-
gree certiﬁcate, references, a short description of the
applicant and his / her experience.

The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in-
vites applications for an
Independent Junior Research Group
in the ﬁeld of
“Experimental Evolution”
The Institute is located in Pl¨ on in Northern Germany,
close to Kiel and L¨ ubeck. It has recently changed its fo-
cus from Limnology to Evolutionary Biology, including
a restructuring and major new investments. It has cur-
rently two Departments, one for evolutionary Ecology
(head Manfred Milinski) and one for evolutionary Ge-
netics (head Diethard Tautz). A third Department on
evolutionary Theorie will shortly be ﬁlled. We are seek-
ing a candidate who can start an independent research
program in experimental evolution either on microbial44 EvolDir December 1, 2007
systems, or suitable other systems.
The position includes:
The group leader position (W2; approximately equiva-
lent to associate professor without tenure) for 5 years
with a possible start-up phase of up to six months
(a contract extension by two times two years can be
granted after successful evaluation).
In addition, there is one postdoc position, one PhD
scholarship, a technical assistant position and a com-
petitive startup package for instrumentation, as well as
the necessary laboratory and oﬃce space and an ade-
quate budget for running costs.
The successful candidate has no formal teaching obli-
gations, but will be asked to contribute to the planned
graduate school program. In addition, an aﬃliation
with our partner university (Christian Albrechts Uni-
versit¨ at Kiel) is possible.
Seehttp://www.snwg.mpg.de/ for details of the appli-
cation procedure via the internet until Dezember 14,
2007. Note that the position is part of a pool of posi-
tions in the MPG that are advertised in parallel, but
this particular position is speciﬁcally for the MPI for
Evolutionary Biology.
The institute is located in a beautiful landscape area
(a traditional holiday region). The town (Pl¨ on) has
an excellent infrastructure, including a high class cul-
tural program during the summer months in the town
and its surroundings. The neighbouring cities (Kiel
and L¨ ubeck) are about 30-40 min away, one of the top
cities of Germany (Hamburg) is 80 min away (by car
or train). I mention this, since a ﬁrst look at the map
might convey the feeling that we are located at a re-
mote place. However, everybody who has looked closer
at this, found that the living conditions are excellent
and provide an ideal setting for productive research.

The Research Training Program is a museum-based,
in-residence program exclusively for currently enrolled,
English proﬁcient, college-level undergraduate students
interested in a career in the biological, geological or an-
thropological sciences. Through a competitive review
process approximately 20 outstanding students from
around the world are selected each year to participate.
Students partner with a Smithsonian scientist to inves-
tigate a natural history research topic as well as partic-
ipate in a series of lectures, workshops, demonstrations,
behind-the-scenes tours, and ﬁeld trips that focused onexploring natural history science and developing the
skills necessary to become eﬀective researchers. Stu-
dents, in collaboration with their Smithsonian research
advisor, develop and test a scientiﬁc hypothesis and
communicate the results through written manuscripts
plus oral and poster presentations. Research is con-
ducted in-residence at the Smithsonian’s National Mu-
seum of Natural History in Washington, DC utilizing
the vast research facilities and collection of the Museum
including 126 million natural history specimens.
Comments RTP participant Sheena Ketchum: “The
RTP lectures and tours provided me with a com-
pletely rounded and hands-on natural history educa-
tion that is impossible to obtain anywhere else. Only
here, and only through the RTP, over a course of
ten weeks, could I have held a stone hand axe from
Olduvai Gorge, touched a Mars meteorite, examined
a 8,000 year-old skeleton from North America, played
with a Clovis Point, worn a giant sapphire ring, held
an atlatl, seen a coelacanth, picked up a piece of the
world’s mantle, seen specimens collected by historical
ﬁgures such as: Theodore Roosevelt and Charles Dar-
win, had3
4of a pound of gold thrown at me, ran my
ﬁnger along the KT Boundary, smelled fossilized dung,
seen the ”Soap Man“ and other mummies, examined
Hopewellian beads made out of a meteorite, touched
pieces of the Burgess Shale, seen countless type speci-
mens, viewed the shrunken heads of the Jivaro, held a
4.56 billion-year-old meteorite, visited the rare books
collection, seen a giant squid, experienced ”museum
time“ ﬁrst hand, as well as countless other experiences.”

UAlaska Curator of Fishes
Job Announcement
Curator of Fishes / Assistant Professor of Fisheries
The University of Alaska Museum (UAM) and the UAF
School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (SFOS) invite
applicants for the position of Curator of Fishes and As-
sistant Professor of Fisheries. One of the few Land,
Sea, and Space Grant universities in the nation, UAF
is noted for research expertise in Alaska’s vast fresh-
water and ocean resources, which include more than
half of the nation’s coastline, three-quarters of the con-
tinental shelf, approximately three million inland lakes
and thousands of miles of rivers and streams, and the
largest ﬁshery in the world. As a major resource cen-
ter for the public and university scholars, the mission
of the Museum is to acquire, conserve, investigate, and
interpret specimens and collections relating to the nat-
ural, artistic, and cultural heritage of Alaska, the Cir-
cumpolar North, and beyond. Through education, re-
search, and public exhibits, the Museum serves state,
national, and international science programs. SFOS
serves a similar role in the area of freshwater and ma-
rine sciences, and has 55 faculty and more than 135
graduate students engaged in research in Alaska waters
and throughout the world. This tenure-track position,
located on the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)
campus, will be functionally split between the Museum
(75%) and SFOS (25%). The UAF campus facilities
and expertise are well suited to support broad, collab-
orative research and curatorial interests.
Responsibilities: The successful candidate for this po-
sition will be expected to maintain, expand, and curate
the ﬁsh collection at UAM and develop a dynamic, ex-
ternally funded research program focusing on freshwa-

Global Undersea Research Unit (Fairbanks) in the areas
of ﬁshery population dynamics, ﬁsheries management,ﬁsh and freshwater ecology, aquaculture, population
genetics, bioenergetics, marine biology, and oceanog-
raphy. A marine policy program under development
at the UAF Fisheries Juneau Center, with faculty-
initiated bioeconomic and marine policy research, also
oﬀers collaborative opportunities. There are opportu-
nities to develop collaborative relationships with state
(e.g., Alaska Department of Fish and Game) and fed-
eral (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geolog-
ical Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National
Park Service) agencies that support these research ini-
tiatives. The successful candidate will also be expected
to develop and teach Ichthyology and Marine and Fresh-
water Fishes of Alaska. There is also an expectation
that the successful candidate will participate in service
activities associated with the Museum and SFOS as
well as serve on regional and national committees and
advisory panels.

UBern FieldAssist BirdPredation
I am seeking enthusiastic volunteers interested in as-
sisting a ﬁeld study in Bern, Switzerland. The research
aims to study the eﬀects of diﬀerent avian predators
on life-history traits of Great tits, and the interactions
they might have with ectoparasites of the tits. The tits
are a good system to examine the eﬀects of diﬀerent
predators and ectoparasites since, being hole nesting
birds, the risks the birds face as nestlings are diﬀerent
than those they face once they ﬂedge. I will require 2
ﬁeld assistants that will help with all the aspects of the
work, including ringing the birds, simulating predators,
conducting behavioral observations and recordings, and
more. The study will take place in the forest near Bern
starting roughly at the end of March 2008 and running
until about the end of May 2008. Applicants with a
BSc/Msc in Biology/Ecology and with bird handling
experience would have an advantage. However, moti-
vation will play a key role: the work is hard and de-
manding, may take place in changing weather and re-
quires long hours at times. Motivated applicants could
develop their own individual research on a topic re-
lated to the program and their own interests, and if
particularly motivated could be involved in the pub-
lications. Accommodation and transportation within
Europe may be provided. Some ﬁnancial assistance
may also be available to cover living expenses on a
case by case basis and according to educational status.
Candidates must hold a valid European driving license.

USussex FieldAssist SpainWasps
– VOLUNTEER FIELD ASSISTANT sought for 4-5
months starting mid March 2008, to help with a study
of paper wasp (Polistes) behavioural ecology in south-
ern Spain. If suitable candidates apply, it may be pos-
sible to split the work into 2 x 2.5 month periods. The
work will involve helping a postdoctoral researcher to
census and observe colonies as part of experiments to
elucidate the basis of helping behaviour in these wasps,
which live in small colonies of <100 individuals. The
successful applicant must be prepared to work hard and
have an interest in behavioural/evolutionary biology
and enthusiasm for ﬁeldwork: excellent experience of
insect behavioural ecology will be obtained. A driving
licence and any ability to speak Spanish would be an
advantage. Because the work involves recording colour
marks on individual animals, the job would not be suit-
able for someone who is colour-blind. Our research
group has recently moved to Sussex University ( http:/-
/www.sussex.ac.uk/biology/proﬁle115853.html ). Our
main website is not yet on-line at Sussex, but can
still be viewed at our previous university to get an
idea of the research that we do ( http://www.ucl.ac.uk/-64 EvolDir December 1, 2007

Air fare (from the UK) and accomodation expenses will
be provided, with the applicant needing to pay for only
their own food/personal expenses, which are relatively
cheap in Spain. Accomodation will be a room in a ﬂat
shared with the postdoctoral researcher and/or other
members of the research group - shower, cooking facil-
ities, TV etc., and is in a medium-sized coastal town
with nice beach. Applicants must be available for in-
terview at Sussex University, and review of applications
will begin immediately and continue until the position

AFLP Micro scoring software
Our labgroup is looking to upgrade our

We are wondering if anyone has used the following
programs and how they perform compared to the much
pricier GeneMapper by ABI.

http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/informatics/STRand/ in-

AFLP Micro scoring software
answers
Hello everyone,
I’ve collected all the responses I got to my
AFLP/Microsat Scoring Software post..... Hope this
helps others out there!Krissa Skogen University of Connecticut
Of the ones you listed, I only know GeneMarker. I
am currently using it and not very impressed with that
software; I deﬁnitely prefer GeneMapper. GeneMarker
does not allow setting up a project and adding samples
with time. Every time you add a sample, you need to
start all over again with the analysis. Very cumber-
some! I recently saw the software that comes with the
Beckman Sequencers. I am not sure if it is available
otherwise or it only works with the Beckman System,
but it looked very user friendly and versatile to me.
———————————-
I have been using GeneMapper for microsats. I like it
ﬁne and the support is good but I have not been able
to totally automate the allele calling. I am certainly no
molecular wizard (just another ecologist wannabe), but
in general I am happy with it. Best, Laura Meyerson
———————————-
I have used both Genemarker (for microsats and AFLP)
and Genemapper (for microsats).The softgenetics inc
software is far better (easier to get started, more intu-
itive, better structured) than the ABI software, and
their customer support is far better too!...I tend to
think ABI ’rest on their laurels’ because they have such
a large market share. I would go Softgenetics
———————————-
If your lab use ABI genotyper then GeneMapper is the
best choice based on its function and convenience. But
it is very expansive.
GeneMarker is probably the best choice based on
the compromising functionality and price. You canDecember 1, 2007 EvolDir 67
download a trial version and PDF manual from
http://www.softgenetics.com/downloads.html . Gene-
Marker also supports diﬀerent ﬁle formats of gener-
ated from the genotypers of other brands http://-
www.softgenetics.com/GeneMarker.html . Don’t use
GelCompar II (Applied Maths). It is user-unfriendly
and very limited on number of lanes (about 150 lanes)
in an analysis. This software transforms the curve sig-
nals of genotypes to a gel image ﬁle manually. You have
to set molecular weight of internal standards for each
experiment. ... many other drawbacks can make you
crazy when you are scoring AFLP of large sample size.
———————————-
We use genemarker and are very happy with it. It has
a couple of twitches which make it a little frustrating
from time to time. For example after you have set up
locus rules, you may want to add an allele that you
didnt see before. Most times you can click the allele
and add it to the locus, but other times (maybe 5%
of the time) it wont let you.... but the cost makes it
worthwhile!
———————————-
we’ve used GeneMapper, STRAND, and GeneMarker;
I’d say for the average project GeneMarker is hands-
down the easiest and extremely powerful, well worth
its somewhat cheaper price (relative to GeneMapper).
———————————-
I was in similar situation earlier this year and decided
to go for GeneMarker. And I’m quite happy with that.
GeneMarker is capable of processing large number of
samples, has automatic scoring option and allows man-
ual editing. You can ask for a fully functional trial ver-
sion (30days) and the technical support is very good.
There are little things (with displaying, sorting, editing
etc) that I would personally prefer to work diﬀerently,
but they are planning some development on the soft-
ware soon, so there might be some improvements soon.
So can recommend :-)
———————————-
I’m facing the same problem and was going to get
genographer, which does not do any automated scor-
ing.. so please let me know if you hear something bet-
ter! thanks
———————————-
You might like to consider Applied Biosystem’s free
software - Peak Scanner - available from their website.
I’ve only just downloaded it so can’t give you a verdict
on its usefulness but I could rapidly input dataﬁles and
see the peak traces.
I haven’t had much luck with STRand, particularly
with the newer capillary equipment ﬁles.———————————-
I highly recommend Genographer for AFLP analyses - I
found it worked really well, and is free! Do keep in mind
though that you have to run the raw ABI data through
GeneScan (to deﬁne the ladder) before importing data
into Genographer....
Sorry I can’t oﬀer microsat advice - I’ve always used
GeneMapper....
———————————
I recommend GeneMarker. I have used it extensively
for AFLPs and I think that it has a very ﬂexible set
of tools and is very user- friendly. Also, support from
SoftGenetics is quite nice.

Arctostaphylos uva-ursi collections
Dear Colleagues,
We are undertaking a study of the population genet-
ics/phylogeography of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi within
the greater context of a phylogeny of the genus. Fund-
ing is limited, particularly for travel. We are appealing
for sample collections from populations of this taxon
throughout its large, circumboreal range (with a dis-
junct population in Guatemala). Ideally, we would like
20 plant samples/population sent either on ice or in sil-
ica gel. We would appreciate any assistance, so even
if you can only send samples from one population, we
would be most grateful!
Please let us know if you will be able to help with this
project. Samples should be sent to the address below.
Thank you for your consideration.

Batch runs of STRUCTURE
answers
Dear all,
I received requests for the answers to my STRUCTURE
Batch run problem so below I have pasted 7 diﬀerent
solutions sent by diﬀerent persons. Thanks to every-
one (Anne Duputi¨ ı¿1
2, Tomas Hrbek, Xianfa Xie, Alan
Meerow, Alan Wilton, Robert H. Kraus, Alain Frantz,
Elizabeth, J¨ ı¿1
2rg Br¨ ı¿1
2n, Pamela Wiener) for their at-
tention to that problem.
1- I had the same problem, regardless of the version of
Structure, but it disappeared when I put my working
directory (the one with the dataﬁle and where structure
has to put its results) at the root of the computer (on
the same disk as the one where Structure is installed).
2- I have encountered the same problem as you. It only
occurs with version 2.2, version 2.1 is behaving nor-
mally. About three months ago I wrote to Pritchard
about it, but never got a response. What I think is
going on is that some of the Java routines are not get-
ting initialized correctly by Structure, and so it does
not execute properly. I have solved this by running an-
other Java based program ﬁrst. I usually run FigTree
from Beaumont. Next time I open Structure it executes
normally. I do not know if you have encountered this
as well, but Structure 2.2 will not initialize from the
shortcut, but has to be started directly from the .bat
ﬁle.
3- I once experienced some similar problem. It seems
that the program just did not get started successfully
at the very beginning possibly due to some glitch in the
program. I restarted the program and tried again, that
usually solved the problem for me.
4- I also had the exact same problem on two diﬀerent
machines, and got in touch with Pritchard’s program-
mer - he made a suggestion, which didn’t seem to over-
come the problem (check and see if an updated version
has been posted - I haven’t). His suggestion is sitting
on my work computer - I am home and can’t access
those archived emails. I did a partial workaround by
only specifying half of my desired k values in the batch
- then the batch run went to completion. I then did did
the second half, also without a problem. Don’t know if
there is some issue past a threshold value for the num-December 1, 2007 EvolDir 69
ber of jobs in batch runs, but try my workaround and
see if it succeeds on your machine.
5- I ﬁnd there are some values of K for some runs it
just won’t run for. eg it will do a run with K values 1
to 7 and it works but not if I do K = 8 but will work
for K=9 ? So just try dropping a few K values.
6- I also remeber having trouble with Structure like
this. In my case I had a large dataset and a high
k to run. When I tried that, the smaller k’s ran
without a problem, but the larger k’s, fro a certain
point just did nothing. The problem was allocated
system memory. There is the structure.bat ﬁle in the
main directory of strucutre. If you open that with
an editor, it will say something like: jre \bin\java -
Xmx256m -classpath class \structure.jar RunStructure
This “Xmx256m” part was my problem last year. It
says, it will allocate 256MB of RAM to the software,
which was not enough for larger datasets. I changed it
to “Xmx1024m” and it worked. It was structure 2.1.
7- I have had a similar problem of batch runs in
STRUCTURE not starting. If you just close and re-
open STRUCTURE, re-open the project and start an-
other batch job, it should start the second time time
round. Or at least it did when I tried it.
In my case, with my original installation, solution 2 to 7
did not work. I then tried solution 1. I have three hard
drives and Installing Structure on 2 of them (working
directory and structure.exe on the same hard drive) did
not work. Installing Structure on the third one worked
but not all the time. I sometimes have to start again
the program for the Batch run to work.
Thanks again
Sebastien.

Clusters in trees
Dear EvolDir members,A typical problem is how to detect clusters of ele-
ments/branches in a tree (phylogenetic or otherwise)
that contain a statistically signiﬁcant, higher than ex-
pected number of elements that share a particular fea-
ture. In a recent paper, Antonio Marco and myself
have developed a new strategy to eﬃciently detect those
signiﬁcant clusters. The strategy has broad applica-
tions. We show it can be applied to trees derived from
microarray data, trees derived from graphs of protein-
protein interactions, etc but it is obviously also useful
in an evolutionary context. The title of the paper is “A
general strategy to determine the congruence between
a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical classiﬁcation”. It
has appeared published today and it is available at
http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics . A
PERL script that performs the analyses for trees up to
500 - 1000 elements can be freely downloaded from our
webpage: http://www.uv.es/ ˜ genomica/treetracker/ .
Any comment on the strategy or the program will be
appreciated.

Conservation experiences
Dear EolvDir members,
I would be grateful for experience reports from mem-
bers who have participated in the “Conservation and
Land management Fellowship Program”, which is of-
fered by the Chicago Botanic Gardens in collaboration
with the Bureau of Land Management, National Parks
Service and the USDA Forest Service.
Apart from general experience reports and internship
“ratings”, I am especially interested to ﬁnd out whether
(and how) non-U.S. interns obtained the necessary visa.
I am keen on applying for this internship, however last
year Chicago Botanic Gardens was not prepared to as-
sist in visa application, although their “signature” is
necessary to obtain the visa- working permit for interns
in Germany.
I would be very glad to hear from former interns, as “in-
side” information and valuation about the programm
will help me to decide whether I am prepared to (and
maybe how to) tackle the diﬃcult and expensive pro-
cess of visa/working permit application.70 EvolDir December 1, 2007

Copy Youtube videos for lectures
answers
Greetings Evolutionists,
A while back someone asked how to copy Youtube
videos so that you can use them in lectures. I just
found one way to do it. Here it is step by step.
1) Use Firefox, go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-
US/ﬁrefox/search?q=3Dvideo&status=3D4 and install
the addon Fast Video Download 1.3.1.4. Note that
many of the others listed there are junk and did not
work for me.
2) When you restart Firefox a tiny little icon of a web-
page with a gold arrow will appear at the lower left
hand corner of your browser window.
3) Go to your favourite Youtube webpage (Here is
nice 6 second video of an Odonta hunting if you want
to trouble shoot: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-
3DA9Q8gUTmyd8 )
4) Click on the icon and it will be downloaded where
you choose as a .ﬂv ﬁle.
5) To convert .ﬂv ﬁles to something that you can
actually view, download and install the free program
freez ﬂv2avi.exe ( http://www.brothersoft.com/-
dvdvideo/video conversion/ﬂv toavimpeg w
mvconverter download 59438.html) Our Sophos
antivirus software didn’t show any problems when I
scanned the ﬁle, but I would double check it given that
it is free.
6) Run the program and save your video as avi, mpeg
or wmv!

Mac users:
Steps 1-4 work well for Mac Firefox, as do other add-
ons. But Steps 5-6 do not work on a Mac. Suggest Visu-
alHub ( http://www.techspansion.com/visualhub/ ) for
this purpose.
An entirely diﬀerent Mac approach is via Screen Mimic
(http://www.polarian.com/ ), wherein you simply play
the video you wish to capture (which need not be
YouTube), start the recorder, and a corresponding local
ﬁle is created. It can capture audio too. The captured
ﬁle can be edited, for example, in Quicktime Pro.

EvolRates MetaAnalysis
Hello EvolDir members,
I am working in collaboration with other members of
Andrew Hendry’s lab to expand a database on evolu-
tionary rates. The existing database was analyzed for a
manuscript that is currently “Online Early” at Molec-
ular Ecology (Hendry, Farrugia, and Kinnison. Human
inﬂuences on rates of phenotypic change in wild animal
populations).
I am sending this request for papers (published or not)
or unpublished data that could be used for evolutionary
rate calculation for a meta-analysis. Our criteria are as
follows:
1) wild populations of any organism (measurements
from common garden experiments are ok too)
2) Either: a)phenotypic measures in two or more popu-
lations that shared a common ancestor at a known time
(years and/or generations) in the past, or b)phenotypic
measures in a lineage at diﬀerent points in time
3) mean phenotypic measurements, as well as measures
of variation around the means (e.g. SD, SE) and sam-
ple sizes. If the latter are not available, just the means
are ﬁne. Raw data is also appreciated.
If you have a study that meets the above criteria, we
would be happy to include it in our database. You will
be appropriately acknowledged for any data that we
use.
Please contact me if you have further questions, Erika

HFC meta-analysis
Dear EvolDir members
In 2003 David Coltman and Jon Slate published a meta-
analysis of papers studying heterozygosity-ﬁtness corre-
lations (HFCs) in wild populations (Coltman and Slate
2003 Microsatellite measures of inbreeding: a meta-
analysis. Evolution 57:5, 971-983). In collaboration
with David and Jon, as well as Ben Sheldon, I am now
seeking to update and expand this meta-analysis. In
order to assuage any possible publication bias in the
literature, I would very much like to include relevant
unpublished studies.
As such, if you have any HFC results that ﬁt the criteria
listed below, but have not yet published for whatever
reason, I would be very interested in hearing from you.
All results will be held in strictest conﬁdence, and only
summary data published. Furthermore, anybody con-
tributing to this work will be fully acknowledged. I am72 EvolDir December 1, 2007
interested in results that ﬁt the following criteria: - wild
population(s) - genetic diversity measured by at least
one of the following measures of inbreeding: heterozy-
gosity (H), standardised heterozygosity (SH), mean d2,
internal relatedness (IR), or homozygosity by loci (HL)
- data on at least one life-history or morphometric trait
available - information about population size, demog-
raphy and/or mating system would also be very useful.
Please don’t hesitate to get in touch if you require fur-
ther details. Many thanks, Joanne Chapman

Job trends survey 2
We have had a tremendous response to our survey in
very short period of time. We would ﬁrst like to thank
everybody that has participated so far and encourage
those of you who have not to do so. We would like
to clarify one aspect of the survey. In the instructions
we stated ¨ ı¿1
2Please answer questions as appropriate at
the time of your hire¨ ı¿1
2but this was not written in
bold text and was very easy to miss. This has led to
some confusion on questions asking about your number
of publications. Please indicate the number of publi-
cations you had at your time of hiring. Also to help
decrease the time in takes to do the survey I have in-
cluded a quick link to a list of impact factors below.
Based on the many enthusiastic emails I have received
it appears there is a real need for the dissemination of
these kinds of data. In fact, many excellent suggests
have been made to expand the questions to include
starting salaries, extending hiring time periods, inclu-
sion of government and non-proﬁt jobs, etc. These are
all things we will be considering for a second survey.
Thanks again to all those who have and will be partic-
ipating.

Msvar software input
Dear all,
I want to use msvar (the updated version, described
in Storz and Beaumont 2002 (Evolution 56: 154-166),
which enables to get estimates of N0 and N1). It seems
I have a problem with my input ﬁles, and many trials
of modiﬁcations of many sorts did not help me ﬁguring
out what is wrong.
My pb is: when I double-clic on the .exe ﬁle to run the
program, the dos window closes as soon as it opens, and
I get an error message saying “error:: ploidy is wrong”.
I know there is no problem with the ploidy nb I entered,
and don’t understand what is going on.
If anyone has already had this kind of problem, I would
be very grateful if they would share their experience
with me.

Dear Evoldir folks,
We have created a perl script that facilitates the es-
timation of divergence times using MULTIDIVTIME
program. This script links baseml, paml2modelinf, es-
tbNew, and multidivtime programs, and asks you for
information to create the control ﬁles for baseml, and
multidivtime. Before running multidivtime, this script
also creates a ﬁle containing a tree (in Newick format)
with the number of the nodes as lables. This ﬁle can be
opened in Treview, in order to easily assign calibration
points.
We also know that most of the time sequence format
is a terrible headache, so we have also created a perl
script to transform fasta alignment ﬁles into ﬁles that
are compatible with baseml, estbNew, and multidiv-
time so that they can be analyzed by these programs
without problems.
These scripts can be obtained at www.biokubuntu.com
(click in enlaces). If you ﬁnd any problems please let
us know.

that these two species may be easily misidentiﬁed in
the ﬁeld. For this reason I was wondering if anyone has
any samples of Zameus squamulosus that you would be
willing to share with us, in order that we can geneti-
cally validate our samples before we continue with the
construction of the microsatellite library.

Software GenClone 2 0
The software GenClone has now been updated and the
new version is available at the following link:
http://www.ccmar.ualg.pt/maree/software.php?soft=-
genclon Although designed mainly for clonal organ-
isms, GenClone has propose resampling procedures to
standardize allelic and genotypes richness estimates to
the lowest sample size used, which can be of interest
for any organism, including non clonal ones.
Besides this general feature, GenClone is designed to
analyze population genetics data of haploid or diploid
clonal organisms, and perform s the following tasks:
1. Discriminates distinct multilocus genotypes
(MLGs), and uses permutation and re-sampling ap-
proaches to test for the reliability of sets of loci and
sampling units for estimating genotypic and genetic di-
versity. (This is also useful for non-clonal organisms.)
2. Computes statistics to test for clonal propagation
or clonal identity of replicates. 3. Computes various
indices describing genotypic diversity. 4. Summarizes
the spatial organization of MLGs with adapted spatial
autocorrelation methods and clonal subrange estimates.
What changes from GenClone 1.1 to GenClone 2.0:
The new features form Arnaud-Haond et al (in
press in Molecular Ecology, doi: 10.1111/j.1365-
294X.2007.03535.x) and Rozenfeld et al. (2007) namely
the Pareto distribution, spectrum of microsatellites dis-
tances, aggregation index and Edge eﬀect index are im-
plemented in Genclone 2.0

A new TREEFINDER version is online at:
www.treeﬁnder.de TREEFINDER is a software to
compute phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.
New features are:
- improved tree search algorithm - tree formats ex-
tended for edge length intervals - consensus trees with
edge length intervals - easier divergence time intervals
There is now a second level of search depth, which is
trying up to seven times as many topological rearrang-
ments as the old algorithm. Level 2 is therefore more
likely to ﬁnd best tree, especially when trees are large
and likelihood surface is ﬂat.

Software TESS post-processing
Dear evoldir members,
R scripts for plotting two-dimensional maps of mem-
bership coeﬃcients are now available from the TESS
web page.
An example plot is available here: http://www-
timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/yb2.jpg These scripts
are useful to post-process TESS outputs, and they
may also be useful for other programs like CLUMPP,
STRUCTURE, BAPS, FASTRUCT, etc. The graph-
ics generated by the scripts provide information similar
to the standard one-dimensional membership coeﬃcient
bar plots, but in two dimensions. These spatial interpo-
lates may be better for data interpretation. In addition
they use facilities for overlaying geographical maps.

jarizaga@alumni.unav.esTerrapin MHC primers
We are starting a new project looking at MHC varia-
tion in the Diamond back terrapin Malaclemys terrapin.
This is an undergraduate honor’s research project. We
have scoured the literature for any other studies on
MHC in terrapins or any turtle species without success.
There are some sequences in GenBank, including MHC
class II B sequences, but they are derived from a lab
in China, and we are not able to contact the authors.
We have designed some degenerate primers based on
reptile, amphibian, ﬁsh, and mammal sequences, but
was wondering if anyone else has been working with
any MHC loci in turtles or terrapins, and if so if they
would be willing to share their primer sequences with
us. In addition, any recommendations or advice on
working with MHC in non-model species would also be
welcomed.

HarvardU Economics and evolutionDecember 1, 2007 EvolDir 79
A 24-month post-doctoral position, potentially extend-
able to 36 months, is available starting in January,
2008. The position is a joint appointment between the
Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology
and the Department of Economics at Harvard Univer-
sity, and is funded by a National Science Foundation
grant provided in partnership with the European Sci-
ence Foundation EUROCORES program The Evolu-
tion of Cooperation and Trading (TECT, <http://-
www.esf.org/tect >www.esf.org/tect). Under TECT,
eight PIs in six countries have organized a collaborative
research project, called BIOCONTRACT, to develop
and test theories regarding the evolution of mutualism.
The aim of the postdoctoral position at Harvard is
to adapt economic theory to the evolutionary theory
of mutualism. In particular, we are interested in the
branch of economics that models transactions in which
participants have “private information,” raising the
possibility of cheating. Contract theory and other kinds
of economic game theory have the potential to link bi-
ological market models with the body of mutualism
theory that is largely concerned with the evolution of
cheating.
We have assembled a team of economists and biolo-
gists to adapt economic models to a variety of mutu-
alisms for which we have extensive empirical data, in-
cluding ants and plants, ants and lycaenid butterﬂies,
ﬁgs and wasps, and plasmids and bacteria. Research
topics that can be addressed include the evolution of
interspeciﬁc signaling and deception, asymmetries be-
tween hosts and symbionts, adverse selection and mar-
ket segmentation as applied to partner choice mecha-
nisms, tailored models of speciﬁc mutualisms for which
we have detailed behavioral data, and general models
outlining the kinds of contracts that can exist between
species, with the overall aim of understanding the fac-
tors promoting or deterring the evolution of mutualism.
The post-doctoral researcher will work with Professor
Naomi E. Pierce in the Department of Organismic and
Evolutionary Biology and Professors Jerry Green and
Drew Fudenberg in the Department of Economics. Reg-
ular meetings and opportunities for extended interac-
tions with the other members of the BIOCONTRACT
team and their research groups will be available: Prof.

The applicant should have a PhD in Biology, Eco-
nomics, Mathematics, or related area. Proﬁciency
in mathematical modeling is required, and familiar-ity with biological models of cooperation, evolutionary
game theory, or economic modeling is desirable. Salary
is commensurate with experience.
Applicants should submit a curriculum vitae, state-
ment of research interests and representative publica-
tions, and should arrange for three letters of reference
to be sent to Naomi Pierce, Department of Organis-
mic and Evolutionary Biology, 26 Oxford Street, Cam-
bridge, MA 02138, USA. Review of applications will

Postdoctoral Position: Nematode Ecological Genomics
at Kansas State University
A NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available in
the Herman lab ( http://www.k-state.edu/hermanlab )
in the Division of Biology at Kansas State University.
The post-doc will work as part of an interdisciplinary
team studying the genomic basis of soil nematode re-
sponses to environmental change. We combine ﬁeld-
based and laboratory approaches, using both genetic
model and native soil nematodes (Jones et al. 2006,
Mol. Ecol., 15, 2601; Ungerer et al., 2007, Heredity;
Kammenga et al., 2007, TREE, 22, 273). Speciﬁcally,
laboratory tests using C. elegans and native soil ne-
matodes are used to determine which genes aﬀect ﬁt-
ness responses to environmental change. Ultimately,
we aim to determine how changes in gene expression
by nematodes as they respond to environmental cues
in the ﬁeld relate to changes in soil nematode commu-
nities and processes. Our studies are part of the Kansas
State University Ecological Genomics Institute ( http:/-
/www.k-state.edu/ecogen ). Ecological genomics is an
integrative ﬁeld of study that seeks to understand the
genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive responses of
organisms to their natural environment. The position
is available for one year, with two additional one-year
terms possible subject to performance and funding.
Kansas State University is located in Manhattan, KS, a
vibrant college town nestled in the Flint Hills of Kansas,
two hours west of Kansas City.
Preference will be given to applicants with expertise in
Molecular Ecology and Functional Genomics. C. ele-
gans experience is also a plus, but not required. Appli-
cants should have the interest and willingness to cross
disciplines. Review of applications begins January 2,

Madagascar Biogeography
Background:
The position will oversee all aspects of the research
goals of the Yoder Lab as well as manage its daily activ-
ities, including ordering of supplies, and general over-
sight of research and educational activities. The lab is
located in Duke’s Biological Sciences Building where we
are a member of the highly dynamic and interactive De-
partment of Biology. As of today, the department has
44 faculty, 54 postdocs and 100 grad students. To say
that it is a dynamic and interactive department only
scratches the surface.
All lab projects aim to investigate the geological and ge-
ographic forces that drive patterns of vertebrate distri-
bution and endemism in Madagascar. Madagascar has
been designated as one of the most critical geographic
priorities for conservation action, retaining less than
10% of the natural habitats that existed before human
colonization. Field inventory activities, primarily con-
ducted by colleagues at the Field Museum of Natural
History, German Primate Center, and the University of
Antananarivo, focus on the herpetofauna and mammals
occuring at the survey sites. Phylogenetic, population
genetic, and biogeographic analysis of these animals,
each with unique life-history and dispersal characteris-
tics, are conducted to identify areas of high endemism
potentially associated with underlying geological and
climatic features. All projects thrive on the integration
of ﬁeld, lab, and geospatial analysis for understanding
biogeographic patterns. The lab also has a signiﬁcant
focus on capacity-building through the education and
training of both American and Malagasy students.
Qualiﬁcations:
The successful applicant will have completed their
Ph.D. and is expected to have the necessary molecu-lar skills to generate DNA sequence data for a number
of vertebrate groups, as well as the appropriate phy-
logenetic and/or population genetic analytical skills to
interpret the data. In particular, given that we will
be focusing on many taxonomic groups at or below
the species level, expertise in coalescent methods is
highly desirable. The applicant should also have an en-
thusiasm for biodiversity studies and conservation, as
well as a willingness to interact with and, on occasion,
train Malagasy scholars as well as Duke undergradu-
ates. Field work is not an integral part of the position,
though ﬁeld possibilities may exist depending upon the
skills and interests of the successful candidate. The
successful candidate will be highly organized, mature,
enthusiastic, and motivated.
Conditions:
This position is funded for two years, with the possi-
bility of a third year extension. Salary is competitive,
and the position will carry full beneﬁts. The position
will be given to the most highly- qualiﬁed applicant,
though a start date no later than February 1, 2008 is
highly desired.

Institute of Biomedical & Life Sciences, University of
Glasgow
£29,139 - £32,796 per annum
Ref: 13872/DPO/A3
We are looking for a post-doctoral research assistant
to develop statistical methods for integrating viral se-
quence data with more traditional epidemiological data
on host spatial location and infection periods collected
during epidemics. The goal is to develop statistical
tools with which to enable reliable and eﬃcient infer-
ence about population contact structures and transmis-
sion patterns. This Franco-British project is jointly
funded by BBSRC and ANR and will be supervised
from both the University of Glasgow and the French
National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) in
Montpellier and Avignon. The primary location for
where the PDRA will be based is negotiable.
The project aims to develop and apply cutting edge sta-
tistical and mathematical methods that integrate evolu-
tionary and epidemiological processes across scales us-
ing real epidemiological and phylogenetic data. ’Foren-
sic epidemiology’ plays an increasingly important part
in disease control and management, but we currently
lack statistically rigorous methods to combine diﬀerent
data types. While we ultimately wish these methods
to be generalizable to a wide class of pathogens, the
primary focus will be on RNA viruses because of their
high mutation rate. The two pathosystems we will work
with will be Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and
Plum pox virus (PPV).
We are looking for candidates with skills in all or
some of the following areas: Bayesian statistics, ap-
plied mathematics, computer programming, phyloge-
netic modelling, evolutionary genetics or related sub-
jects. They should speak English, and French literacy
would be a plus. Strong communication and teamwork
skills are fundamental given the multi-disciplinary and
international context of the project.
The project, led by Professors Dan Haydon (Univer-
sity of Glasgow) and Jo¨ el Chaduf (INRA, Avignon),
involves collaboration in the UK with Rod Page, Ro-man Biek (University of Glasgow) and David Paton
(Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright), and in France
(INRA, Montpellier) with G´ erard Labonne, Sylvie Dal-
lot and Ga¨ el Th´ ebaud. The team includes specialists in
statistics, modelling, bio-informatics, evolutionary ge-
netics, epidemiology, and plant and animal virology.

Position Announcement Postdoctoral Research Fellow
Vector Research Group University of Kentucky * Lex-
ington, KY
Applications are invited for a full-time postdoctoral fel-
low. The position is available immediately.
Wolbachia cause a form of sterility in insects known
as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which results in
karyogamy failure and arrested embryonic develop-
ment. In populations that include both uninfected and
infected individuals, unidirectional CI can drive the re-
placement of the uninfected cytotype with the infected
cytotype, resulting in the conversion of an uninfected
population into an infected population (termed: “pop-
ulation replacement”). In populations where individ-
uals are infected with diﬀerent Wolbachia types, bi-December 1, 2007 EvolDir 89
directional CI can occur: sterility results in both cross
directions between mates infected with diﬀerent Wol-
bachia types. Models predict that in natural popula-
tions, sterility resulting from bi-directional CI is a tran-
sient event, since one infection will predominate and
replace the other cytotype.
While substantial eﬀort has been devoted to examining
the eﬀect of Wolbachia on individuals (e.g., Wolbachia
eﬀects on egg hatch, longevity, etc.), relatively little
is known about population-level eﬀects of Wolbachia.
We seek a collaborator with interest and experience
in mathematical modeling, statistics, demography and
ecology. The successful applicant will lead the analy-
sis of existing data sets of insect populations that are
either infected with Wolbachia or are uninfected. The
recruit will also be encouraged to develop additional
modeling and/or empirical projects.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. The ideal candidate
will have a competitive publication record and enjoy
working in a multidisciplinary environment. Funding
is available for up to four years with annual renewal
contingent upon satisfactory performance. Funds are
available for participation in professional meetings.
Applicants are requested to send a detailed curriculum

AvianEvolutionaryGenomics
Post-doc in evolutionary genomics
at the Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala Univer-
sity, Sweden Centre of Excellence in Evolutionary Ge-
nomics
Genome sequencing (6x coverage) of the second bird
species to have its genome characterised - the zebra
ﬁnch - has just been completed. A post-doc position
focusing on evolutionary genomic and molecular evolu-
tionary analysis of the zebra ﬁnch genome sequence is
now available in Hans Ellegren’s laboratory
The zebra ﬁnch is an important model species for neu-
robiology. and has led to several important discoveries.
The production of new neurons in adult brain was ﬁrst
reported in zebra ﬁnch, which challenged the univer-
sally held dogma that neurogenesis does not occur in
adults. Research in this species also demonstrated that
active synthesis of estrogen in the zebra ﬁnch brain,
causing masculine patterns of neural development andDecember 1, 2007 EvolDir 95
challenging the view of estrogen being a strictly gonadal
steroid. Songbirds are unique among non-humans in
their combination of vocal sophistication and experi-
mental accessibility. Like humans, songbird vocaliza-
tions are learned and this learning process has close
similarities to human speech. For example, FOXP2,
the ﬁrst gene linked to speech disorder in humans is
also expressed in the neural song circuit of zebra ﬁnch,
especially at times of vocal learning.
The project involves whole-genome analysis of molec-
ular evolutionary processes in avian genomes. This
will include analyses of, among other things, adaptively
evolving genes, conserved non-coding DNAs, evolution
of novel genes and expansion of gene families. The
main source of data comes from the comparison of the
chicken and zebra ﬁnch genomes, as part of the ze-
bra ﬁnch genome sequencing project, however, there
is also sequence data from additional bird species ob-
tained through 454 sequencing. In addition, evolution
of gene expression will be studied based on transcrip-
tome proﬁling and population genomic analyses will be
done based on large-scale SNP data.
The successful applicant must hold a PhD and should
have experience from large-scale molecular evolutionary
analyses using bioinformatic approaches. Programming
skills are desirable. The position is for two years, with
possibilities for extension, and is within a lab group of
about 10 people including PhD students and interna-
tional post-docs.
The position is immediately available and the search
will remain open until the position is ﬁlled.

This project is part of a broader program to evalu-
ate the eﬀects of climate change on Paciﬁc salmon, to
be funded through the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis. The bulk of the work will be
carried out by the three Research Associates, in con-
junction with a Workgroup of top salmon biologists,
evolutionary biologists, and atmospheric scientists who
will reﬁne the research plan, guide implementation, and
direct eﬀorts toward publishable products. The work
will be in Seattle, at the University of Washington,
Seattle, WA, with periodic gatherings at NCEAS to
meet with the full Workgroup and coordinate with re-
lated projects. The overall project will begin Novem-
ber 15, 2007, and run for 30 months (until April 2010);
postdoctoral positions will run for two years, starting
any time from now until next spring. The University of
Washington is an aﬃrmative action, equal opportunity
employer. The University is building a culturally di-
verse faculty and staﬀ and strongly encourages applica-
tions from women, minorities, individuals with disabil-
ities and covered veterans. Interested parties should
send via email a CV, a letter explaining their qualiﬁca-
tions, 3 letters of recommendation and a proposed start
date to Nathan Mantua using the contact info below.
Review will begin immediately and continue until posi-
tions are ﬁlled. For successful candidates, a background
check for criminal history is required.

The workshop will emphasize protein evolution on all
scales, with the goal to link genomics, protein biochem-
istry and protein physics to organismal phenotypes and
ﬁtness. We are therefore very interested in bringing to-
gether a diverse community of scientists with interests
ranging from fundamental statistical mechanics to pop-
ulation genetics and everything in between.
Workshops at the ACP diﬀer from more conventional
conferences or workshops. There is no rigid program;
participants are encouraged to talk informally and de-
velop (and carry out) exciting new research ideas. Par-
ticipants are usually expected to stay for at least two
weeks (though exceptions are possible).
There are three important issues we have to highlight:
1. Funding for this workshop consists primarily of a
housing subsidy. You should expect to cover your own
travel, and pay a registration fee and part of the housing
costs. See Aspen-Center-for-Physics website for costs.
2. This is a workshop for experienced scientists, not a
summer school. The Aspen Center for Physics gener-
ally does not accept applications by graduate students.
3. If you are interested in attending the workshop,
please apply electronically before January 31, 2008 at
this site: https://db.aspenphys.org/fmi/iwp/cgi?-db=-

GeneExpressionEvolution Dec5
Evolution of stochastic gene expression A one-day
workshop, Wednesday 5 December 2007, University of
Liverpool. Co-organizers: Michael Brockhurst, Claire
Harper, Matthew Spencer. Background This workshop
will bring together systems biologists, mathematicians,
and evolutionary biologists to explore the evolutionary
causes and consequences of stochastic gene expression,
and to come up with ideas for experimental tests of
hypotheses in these areas.
Gene expression is stochastic in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. Reasons for this include intrinsic biochem-
ical noise, and ﬂuctuations in the state of other compo-
nents of the cell. It has been suggested that the level of
stochasticity is an evolvable trait, and that stochastic
gene expression is sometimes beneﬁcial to clonal popu-
lations as a way of maximizing population growth rate.
Some theory already exists, but there is scope for much
more sophistication at the ecological and systems bi-
ology levels. In principle, predictions from models of
stochastic gene expression are testable in bacterial mi-100 EvolDir December 1, 2007
crocosms. This will require techniques for maintaining
long-term environmental stochasticity and measuring
gene expression in individual bacterial cells. Work in
this area will therefore require collaboration between
researchers with expertise in systems biology (measure-
ment of gene expression), experimental microbial evolu-
tion (manipulation of environmental stochasticity), and
theoretical evolutionary biology/applied mathematics
(modelling optimal levels of stochasticity).
Conﬁrmed speakers Robert Beardmore, Department of
Mathematics, Imperial College. Resource-mediated di-
versity in bacteria-phage coevolution.
Nils Bl¨ uthgen, Systems Biology Group, Manchester
Interdisciplinary Biocenter, University of Manchester.
Noise reduction strategies in mammalian signal trans-
duction.

tation aﬀects the protein co-regulation network.

Analysis of transcription within single mammalian
cells.
Programme Exact times to be announced. Invited
speakers will give presentations in the morning. Follow-
ing lunch, there will be an optional afternoon session in
which discussion groups will focus on speciﬁc biolog-
ical questions. Each group will give a short informal
summary at the end of the day.
Registration Advance registration is free, but is re-
quired no later than 23 November 2007, by email to
m.spencer at liverpool dot ac dot uk. Please let me
know any special dietary requirements, and whether
you plan on attending for the whole day or just the
morning session and lunch.
Location The workshop will be held in the Foresight
Centre, building 97 on the map.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
