PSE) Beijing, China July 7-9, 2010
SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT
Objectives Systematic biology faces tremendous chal-
lenges and opportunities at the present time. This
conference aims at providing an opportunity for plant
systematists and evolutionary biologists to review the
progress, evaluate the current status, and look into the
future of the ﬁeld. China hosts enormous plant diver-
sity that has supported its long history and continuous
advancement in studying plant systematics. With espe-
cially rapid progress made during the recent years, 2010
comes to be the time for China to invite colleagues from
the world to discuss the new frontiers of systematic bi-
ology. This would provide an ideal forum for Chinese
and international colleagues to present research results,
exchange ideas, discuss common interests, develop col-
laborations, stimulate young students, and move the
ﬁeld of systematic biology forward. The conference will
include talks, posters, and open discussions on recent
progress and future directions of the following areas: 1)
Taxonomy, collections, and databases; 2) Phylogenet-
ics, phylogenomics, and the Tree of Life; 3) Biogeogra-
phy and phylogeography; 4) Speciation, hybridization,
and adaptation; 5) Molecular evolution, evolutionary
genetics and genomics, and Evo-Devo.
Organizers: Botanical Society of China (BSC) Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) International Association

Dear colleagues,
We organize a conference on “Social systems: demo-
graphic and genetic issues” next October (11-15 ^th )
in Paimpont, Brittany, France. We propose the confer-
ence to be organized around 2 major themes:
1. /Social organization and demographic structure/ –
The inﬂuence of philopatry, polygyny, dispersal bias
among sexes, natal sex ratio, social reproductive sup-
pression, kin selection and kin discrimination, on de-
mographic structure
2. /Social organization and genetic structure/ –The ef-
fects of social organization and group dynamics, the role
of group ﬁssion, ﬁssion-fusion social systems, sex biased
dispersal, the inﬂuence of dominance rank (lineages or
individuals), mate choice on the distribution of relat-
edness and gene diversity of neutral and functional (for
instance MHC) genes. The conference will mix theoret-
ical and empirical approaches, scientiﬁc questions with
methodological issues.
The conference will be limited to about 75 people,
with space for about forty oral communications and for
posters. We invite people who wish to communicate at
the conference to send us a tentative title for an oral
communication or a poster before May 15 ^th .

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
This is the ﬁrst oﬃcial call for abstracts for the Fourth
International Symposium on Biomolecular Archaeology
(ISBA4), which will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark,
between 7-11 September, 2010. The symposium aims
to highlight recent advances in biomolecular archaeol-
ogy and to provide an international forum to present
and discuss research results. This year’s symposium is
being hosted by the Center for GeoGenetics of the Uni-May 1, 2010 EvolDir 7
versity of Copenhagen and will be held at the Geocenter
in central Copenhagen.
Judging by the three previous meetings in Amsterdam,
Stockholm, and York, we anticipate a wide range of
interesting podium and poster presentations on all as-
pects of research in biomolecular archaeology, including
proteomics, ancient DNA and stable isotope analysis.
In addition, we are pleased to announce several key-
note speakers, including Anne Pedersen from the Na-
tional Museum of Denmark, Eske Willerslev from the
Centre for GeoGenetics, and T. Douglas Price from the
University of Wisconsin, Madison.
To register for the symposium, please go to our web-
site at www.isba4.net and follow the links to registra-
tion. Once you have registered online you will receive
an email, containing the payment details. The registra-
tion fee is 130 Euros, if you register before 1 June 2010.
Thereafter, the registration fee will increase to 150 Eu-
ros. This includes a symposium pack, lunch, wireless
access, and a buﬀet reception at the Carlsberg Academy
on Friday evening (but NOT accommodation). Regis-
tration closes 25 August.
To submit an abstract please use the abstract template
provided on our website and submit it no later than
1 May 2010. We welcome submissions on all aspects
of research on ancient biomolecules, including recent

Dear Evoldir readers,
We still have some slots available in our symposium
“The social evolution of fusion and exclusion” at the
IUSSI meeting in Copenhagen (8-14 August 2010,
http://www.iussi.org/iussi2010/ ). The symposium will
bring together researchers working on the evolution of
fusion or exclusion at diﬀerent hierarchical levels of bi-
ological organization, ranging from single cells to social
parasitism in social insects. Invited speakers are Rick
Grosberg and Joan Strassmann. Below you ﬁnd the de-
scription of our symposium. The deadline for abstract
submission is 1 May 2010.8 EvolDir May 1, 2010
The social evolution of fusion and exclusion The po-
tential for fusion or mixing between diﬀerent biologi-
cal units is widespread, ranging from single cells form-
ing multicellular structures, via modular multicellu-
lar organisms such as fungi forming larger individu-
als, to colonies of social insects forming super colonies.
However, successful integration is usually restricted to
close relatives regulated by precise kin recognition sys-
tems. Such conditional integration is consistent with
kin-selection theory, because the potential inclusive ﬁt-
ness cost and the potential for cheating decrease with
increasing relatedness. However, if recognition is based
on genetic cues, in the short term, allorecognition al-
leles are under positive-frequency dependent selection,
which removes the required polymorphism (Crozier,
1986). Several possible solutions have recently been
proposed for this paradox, but these largely remain to
be tested. In this symposium, the social biology of fu-
sion and mixing in general, and the maintenance of ge-
netic kin recognition regulating integration in particu-
lar, will be covered. The symposium will bring together
researchers working on diﬀerent hierarchical levels of bi-
ological organization, at which mixing occurs, ranging
from single cells to social parasitism in social insects.

CALL FOR PAPERS
Genome-wide association mapping and rare alleles:
from population genomics to personalized medicine
A session of the Paciﬁc Symposium on Biocomputing
2011 January 4-7, 2011 Big Island, Hawaii, USA
Genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) have been
very successful in identifying common genetic variation
associated to numerous complex diseases. However,
most of the identiﬁed common genetic variants appear
to confer modest risk and few causal alleles have been
identiﬁed. Furthermore, these associations account for
a small portion of the total heritability of inherited dis-
ease variation. This has led to the reexamination of
the contribution of environment, gene-gene and gene-
environment interactions, and rare genetic variants in
complex diseases. There is strong evidence that rare
variants play an important role in complex disease eti-
ology and may have larger genetic eﬀects than common
variants. Currently, much of what we know regarding
the contribution of rare genetic variants to disease risk
is based on a limited number of phenotypes and candi-
date genes. However, rapid advancement of second gen-
eration sequencing technologies will invariably lead toMay 1, 2010 EvolDir 9
widespread association studies comparing whole exome
and eventually whole genome sequencing of cases and
controls. A tremendous challenge for enabling these
“next generation” medical genomic studies is develop-
ing statistical approaches for correlating rare genetic
variants with disease outcome.
The analysis of rare variants is challenging since meth-
ods used for common variants are woefully underpow-
ered (e.g., accurately estimating allele frequencies in
cases vs. controls requires ~10 observations of the minor
allele; however, many of the functional rare alleles may
be present only once in the resequence data). There-
fore, methods that can deal with genetic heterogeneity
at the trait-associated locus and that can be applied to
both in cases vs. controls and quantitative trait stud-
ies are needed. Currently, these approaches are in their
infancy and very basic criteria (such as functional an-
notation, sequence conservation, or biological pathway
classiﬁcation) are used. There is tremendous opportu-
nity to apply data mining methods outside of the stan-
dard statistical toolkit to this problem. Additionally,
deep sequencing will reveal many variants that are not
causal, and in order to reduce the problems of misclas-
siﬁcation, i.e. inclusion of non-causal variants and ex-
clusion of causal variants in the analysis, it is beneﬁcial
to predict their potential functionality. Thus, methods
to classify and annotate rare variants for subsequent
analysis are necessary.
The session of PSB 2011 would focus on distilling cur-
rent knowledge in assessing rare variant functionality
and their correlation with complex traits, and more
importantly bring forth methodological questions that
need to be addressed for successful analysis of rare vari-
ants. “GWAS by sequencing” presents many new chal-
lenges and proposed solutions for interpreting sequenc-
ing data from clinical case/control cohorts will be of
particular interest to a diverse audience. The session
will similarly consider application-speciﬁc algorithms,
analysis methods, or study planning and design tools
with emphasis in the leveraging rare genetic variation
in complex trait/disease correlation.
CALL FOR PAPERS AND POSTERS We encourage
academic, government, and industrial scientists to sub-
mit manuscripts with original work in the subject area.
PSB will publish accepted full papers in an archival
proceedings indexed in Medline. All contributed papers
will be rigorously peer-reviewed by at least two referees.
A limited number of papers will be selected for oral pre-
sentation to the full assembled conference. Posters and
computer demonstrations are also requested to comple-
ment the session, and require the submission of a one-
page abstract. Accepted poster abstracts will be dis-
tributed at the conference separately from the archivalProceedings. In addition of the oral presentation of
the full papers, and the poster session, an invited panel
discussion devised to encourage discussion of the chal-
lenges facing the ﬁeld will be also held. POSSIBLE

Abstract: Recent advances in sequence analysis of eu-
karyotic genomes bring to the forefront their potential
to be shaped by horizontal transfer (HT), which has
long been recognized as a major force in prokaryotic
genome evolution, but was under-appreciated in eu-
karyotes. This symposium will provide a unique op-
portunity to bring together researchers exploring the
pathways and complexities of HT in a wide range of
eukaryotes, including protists, plants, fungi and ani-
mals. Topics include, but are not limited to, mecha-
nisms and consequences of HT, diversity of donors and
recipients, role of biological interactions (e.g. endosym-
biosis, parasitism) in facilitating HT, relative contribu-
tion of ecological, behavioral, and genomic factors to
HT, and the ways by which various genetic elements,
non-mobile as well as intrinsically mobile, can cross
germline barriers, adapt to new genomic environments,
shape genomic landscapes, and bring about evolution-
ary changes. Invited talks will be focused on gene trans-
fer in microbial eukaryotes, possible mechanisms and
environmental factors involved in massive HT in bdel-
loid rotifers, and the role played by viruses and par-
asites in lateral transmission of transposable elements
across a wide range of animal taxa, including insects
and vertebrates.

Abstract Evolutionary biologists have long been inter-
ested in deciphering the role of evolution in the under-
standing of molecular processes underlying human dis-
ease. However, the application of evolutionary knowl-
edge in medicine has only just recently begun to gain
prominence among medical educators and practition-
ers. In the emerging post- genomic era, there is a pro-
liferation of novel applications of evolutionary tools,
theory and methods towards a unifying evolutionary
perspective linking this basic science to medical knowl-
edge. Today, molecular evolution is playing a pivotal
role in understanding the molecular and demographi-
cal phenomena giving rise to deleterious mutations un-
derlying monogenic and complex human diseases, oﬀer-May 1, 2010 EvolDir 13
ing insights into novel neurological and metabolic traits
in humans and their associated disorders, and reshap-
ing our understanding of the human immune system
as an emergent evolutionary system. As the medical
community begins its dialog and eﬀorts towards the in-
corporation of evolutionary biology into medicine, the
evolution community has an opportunity to contribute
towards this integration in order to facilitate advances
in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of human dis-
ease. Through this symposium, we seek to build on the
gaining momentum at the nexus of evolutionary biology
and medicine, and to further establish the central im-
portance of evolutionary biology into the mainstream
of medical discovery, practice and education.

Genetics: Natural Selection and Immunity
Organizers Brian Lazzaro (Cornell University, USA)
Lluis Quintana-Murci (Institut Pasteur, FRANCE)
The evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interac-
tions lead to constant selection for adaptation and
counter-adaptation in the two competing species.
Throughout evolution, animals and plants have devel-
oped complex immune defence mechanisms to combat
microbial infections. The past few years have seen an
explosion of studies aiming to understand the eﬀectsof natural selection in the genomes of diﬀerent organ-
isms. This interest has been particularly bolstered by
the advent of genome-wide surveys of genetic variation
based on genotyping or resequencing data from diﬀer-
ent populations and species, the expanding repertoire
of complete genome sequences from several species, and
the development of theoretical models in population ge-
netics. In the context of infection, identifying the ex-
tent and type of natural selection acting upon genes
involved in immunity and host-pathogen interactions
can provide insights into the mechanisms of host de-
fense mediated by them as well as delineate those genes
being essential in host defenses with respect to those ex-
hibiting higher immunological redundancy. This sym-
posium aims to cover the latest ﬁndings in this ﬁeld, to
put together population genetics research coming from
diﬀerent species (from plants to insects and mammals),
and to promote discussion on whether the way natural
selection targets the diﬀerent players of immune sys-
tems (receptors, adaptors, eﬀectors, etc) is shared, or
not, between species.

nomics: from genes to organismal history
*Organizers* *Vincent Daubin* (Universit´ e Lyon1,
FRANCE) *Bastien Boussau* (UC Berkeley, USA)
*Abstract* The traditional approach to studying
genomes, starting from raw sequences, goes through
largely independent steps: annotation and inference of
sequence homology based on similarity, alignment of
homologous genes or genome segments, single gene phy-
logeny and extrapolation to the underlying phylogeny
of organisms, examination of selective pressure acting
on genes, inference of correlations between life history
traits, etc... However, all these levels of analysis de-
pend on each other and the failure to model this de-
pendence can result in the accumulation of errors. For
instance, phylogenies are generally either inferred inde-
pendently from single genes, or inferred from the con-
catenation of several genes. None of these approaches
takes into account the fact that, for several biological
reasons, gene histories are both unique and correlated
with each other. The development of new statistical ap-
proaches coupling inferences at diﬀerent levels of anal-
ysis and using whole genomes, allows explicit model-
ing of the inﬂuence of several evolutionary processes on
the structure of data. The symposium will attempt to
cover recent developments in this area, such as the si-
multaneous inference of gene trees and alignments, the
concomitant reconstruction of gene trees and organism
trees under models of coalescence, gene duplication and
loss, or lateral gene transfers, and the joint reconstruc-
tion of sequence evolution and life history traits.

Abstract A remarkable aspect of evolution is that it
works at all. “Mutations” to single characters in a
computer program essentially never improve its func-
tion, but a small but still signiﬁcant proportion of mu-
tations to DNA do. Many features have been proposed
to explain the high evolvability of biological systems, in-
cluding robustness, modularity, sex and recombination,
and a wide variety of molecular mechanisms, including
many that create correlations between the quantity of
available variation and the degree of stress. This sym-
posium will bring together researchers exploring each of
these putatively general explanations for evolvability, as
well as those investigating case studies of innovation.

Recombination
Dear Evoldir readers,
We invite submissions of abstracts for the “Recom-

In sexual eukaryotes, homologous chromosomes ex-
change genetic information through recombination dur-
ing meiosis. Meiotic recombination is considered to bea fundamental process for two reasons: ﬁrst, in many
taxa crossovers are required for the proper segregation
of chromosomes during meiosis; second, crossovers cre-
ate new combinations of alleles, and hence contribute
to increase the genetic diversity on which selection can
act. Moreover, there is evidence that recombination can
strongly aﬀect genome evolution via non-adaptive pro-
cesses (mutation or biased gene conversion). Besides,
it is known that recombination rates vary ˆ a at diﬀer-
ent scales - across genomes, between sexes and between
taxa. However, the determinants of the evolution of re-
combination are still poorly understood. The purpose
of our symposium is to provide a forum for recent work
on the impact of recombination on genome evolution
(via selective or non- adaptive processes) and on the
evolution of recombination. We propose to bring scien-
tists together from both theoretical and data analysis
lines of research.

of wild tomatoes”
Abstract Most, if not all, species are characterized by
a spatial population structure, i.e. demes connected by
migration. Spatial structuring is a prerequisite for local
adaptation to exist. On the other hand, metapopula-
tion structure and past demographic events are known
to aﬀect the ability to detect signatures of selection
in genomic data. It is therefore important to ana-
lyze the signature of neutral processes depending on
the metapopulation structure and demography before
attempting to detect local adaptation. This sympo-
sium will be dedicated to novel theoretical and empiri-
cal studies aiming to infer the metapopulation structure
and past demography of natural populations. The sym-
posium will also focus on presenting new methodologi-
cal developments to infer local adaptation from genomic
data and presents successful case studies. We plan to
discuss how to quantify local adaptation at candidate
genes, and the level of purifying selection at the popu-
lation level. Contributions from animal and plant sys-
tems will be welcome.
Key words Spatially structured populations, selective
sweeps, balancing selection, purifying selection

Dear Evoldir members,
This is a call for abstracts to be sumitted to the sym-
posium on “Evolutionary genomics of prokaryotes” at
the SMBE meetings this summer in Lyon, France, 4-8
July 2010.
Abstracts are to be submitted until April 23rd through
the conference website: http://smbe2010.univ-

The now routine generation of genomic sequence
datasets has transformed our understanding of the dy-
namics of molecular evolution in prokaryotes, and is
providing ever more detailed insights into the emer-
gence, spatial structuring, specialisations and interac-
tions between diﬀerent bacterial lineages in nature. We
are now beginning to understand the trade-oﬀs involved
in determining bacterial lifestyle choices: To be a spe-
cialist or a generalist? A pathogen or a commensal?
To cooperate or to cheat? This symposium captures
the continuing erosion of the barriers between com-
parative genomics, population genetics, biogeography,
metagenomics and experimental evolution to explore
how bacteria adapt in the face of shifting selective land-
scapes. Four diﬀerent threads are combined: i) Com-
parative genomics overview on how molecular processes
(e.g. gene transfer) impact on ecological adaptation,
ii) how ecology in turn impacts on sequence evolution
iii) detecting the adaptive basis underlying bacterial
diversity using metagenomics, and iv) identifying the
molecular basis of adaptation in experimental systems.
The symposium is deliberately broad, as the synthesis
of these threads into a single symposium will provide
an opportunity to explore fundamental aspects of bac-
terial micro-evolutionary dynamics at the intersection
between ecological and molecular processes. A compar-
ative genomics overview at the start of the session will
highlight the role of horizontal transfer in the exploita-
tion of new niches. The role of stochastic forces, in
particular relating to the eﬀective population size and
selective sweeps, will also be considered in the context
of ecological specialisation and host adaptation. The
inclusion of experimental evolution will add the basic
question of trade-oﬀs between cooperation and compe-
tition between populations and cells, how these trade-
oﬀs can be studied at the molecular level.

Abstract Evolution proceeds in two phases: variation
is generated and then sorted into the next generation.
Population genetics has repeatedly seized upon new
technologies to dissect the evolutionary forces sorting
genetic variation, now at a genome-wide scale. How-
ever, equally important is understanding the processes
that generate variation: how mutations modify the
activity and dynamics of cellular networks and how
these molecular interactions mechanistically translate
genetic variation into variation in phenotypes. In the
last decade, detailed descriptions of the design and dy-
namics of many cellular networks have emerged from
investigations in cell biology. In several cases, we have
clear pictures of how cells integrate information about
their external and internal environments to modify
their physiology or organismal development. Current
models of these networks explain some of their dynamic
properties including robustness, thresholds, homeosta-
sis, and bistability. These appear to be widespread fea-
tures of mechanistic genotype-phenotype maps. In this
symposium we will explore how systems-level molecu-
lar information can be used to investigate the evolution
and structure of genotype-phenotype maps.

Society of Systematic Biologists Call for Symposia for
the 2011 Annual Meeting
The Society of Systematic Biologists invites proposals
for symposia at the 2011 Evolution meeting to be held
in Norman, Oklahoma, from 17-21 June 2011. The
meeting will be held jointly with the American Society
of Naturalists and the Society for the Study of Evolu-
tion, and our host is University of Oklahoma.
Proposals should include (1) a descriptive title, (2) one
or two paragraphs explaining the purpose of the sym-
posium and its relevance to systematics, (3) a list of
presentations including proposed speakers, their insti-
tutions or aﬃliations, and their presentation titles, and
(4) an indication of whether the speakers have been
invited and whether they have agreed to participate.
Symposia are restricted to half-day sessions (6 half hour
talks). The society is particularly interested in sym-
posia whose topics do not overlap with those from pre-
vious meetings (see SSB website for past symposia),
that introduce new ideas or synthesize important con-
cepts, or those that are particularly good examples ofthe analysis of empirical data. Proposals that unite
systematics with other ﬁelds are also desirable. We
encourage participation from young investigators and
others typically under-represented in symposia.
Proposals will be evaluated at the SSB Council meeting
during the 2010 annual meeting in Portland, Oregon.
Soon after, organizers will be notiﬁed of the status of
their proposals. Selected symposia will receive funds to
partially defer participant costs or honoraria.
Deadline: for full consideration, please submit propos-
als by June 15, 2010.

CallTalks
The Call for Lightning Talks is now open for the
inaugural conference on Informatics for Phylogenet-
ics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://-
ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2010 . See below for
instructions.
Lightning talks are short presentations of 5 minutes.
They are ideal for drawing the attention of the audi-
ence to new developments, tools, and resources, or to
subsequent events where more in-depth information can
be obtained. Please also see our FAQ for more informa-
tion ( http://ievobio.org/faq.html#lightning ). Light-
ning talks will be part of the more interactive afternoon
program on both conference days.
Submitted talks should be in the area of informatics
aimed at advancing research in phylogenetics, evolu-
tion, and biodiversity, including new tools, cyberinfras-
tructure development, large-scale data analysis, and vi-
sualization.
Submissions consist of a title and an abstract at most 1
page long. The abstract should provide an overview of
the talk’s subject. Reviewers will judge whether a sub-
mission is within scope of the conference (see above). If
applicable, the abstract must also state the license and
give the URL where the source code is available so re-
viewers can verify that the open-source requirement(*)
is met.
Review and acceptance of lightning talks will be on a
rolling basis. The deadline for submission is the morn-
ing of the ﬁrst day of the conference (June 29). Note
that the number of lightning talk slots is ﬁnite, and
given the high volume of submissions we experienced
for full talks, the Lightning Talks track may ﬁll up early.
We cannot accept lightning talks until the open-source
requirements are met, and so waiting with that until
the deadline risks that the track is full by that time.
We ask all submitters of lightning talks to be willing to
also serve as reviewers of such, as described above.May 1, 2010 EvolDir 21
Lightning talks are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are:
1) Full talks (closed), 2) Challenge entries, 3) Soft-
ware bazaar demonstrations, and 4) Birds-of- a-Feather
gatherings. The Call for Challenge entries remains open
(seehttp://ievobio.org/challenge.html ) , and informa-
tion on the Software Bazaar and Birds-of-a-Feather ses-
sions is forthcoming.

NSF-funded “Undergraduate Diversity at SSE/SSB”
program (in partnership with NESCent). We invitegraduate students, postdocs and faculty members to
serve as mentors to the undergraduates. Mentors
take pairs of students and attend talks with them,
introduce them to colleagues, network, and generally
make the meetings a welcoming place for them. Al-
though costs are not covered for mentors, it is an un-
usually rewarding experience. Contact Rich Kliman
<rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu >if you are interested in
serving as a mentor.

AarhusU EelSpeciation
Ph.D. position - Speciation and selection in European
and American eels (Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata)
Applications are invited for a Ph.D. position at the
Department of Biological Sciences, Aarhus University.
The project concerns aspects of speciation and selection
at the molecular level in Atlantic eels, using population
genomics approaches.
European eel spawns in the southern Sargasso Sea, and
the larvae are subsequently advected more than 5,000
kilometres towards the European and North African
coasts. The American eel spawns in a largely overlap-
ping region of the Sargasso Sea, but the distance to the
North American coasts is considerably shorter. The
two species are known to hybridize occasionally. The
project aims to date the speciation event and assess
whether speciation was sympatric or allopatric, based
on mtDNA sequencing.Furthermore, European eel appears to constitute one
single panmictic population. Yet, adult eels are dis-
tributed throughout environments ranging from Sub-
arctic in Northern Europe to subtropical in North
Africa. Do these environmental diﬀerences invoke selec-
tion within generations that is evident at the molecular
level, or is the European eel an example of remarkable
phenotypic plasticity? This and other issues will be
pursued by analyzing SNPs in unique samples of eel
larvae collected in the Sargasso Sea along with conti-
nental samples of glass eels and adult eels.
The main supervisor of the Ph.D. student will be
Michael M. Hansen, but the student will be involved in
both national and international collaboration including
Drs. Thomas Damm Als and Dorte Bekkevold (Techni-
cal University of Denmark), Dr. Tom Gilbert (Copen-
hagen University, Denmark), Prof. Louis Bernatchez
(Universit´ e Laval, Quebec, Canada) and Dr. Gregory
Maes (Katholieke Universiteit of Leuven, Belgium).

FungalPopulationGenomics
PhD position in Population Genomics of Fungi
I am looking for a highly motivated candidate to work
on a population genetic/genomic project in the plant
pathogenic species Melampsora larici-populina (respon-
sible for the poplar rust). The aim of the PhD is
to highlight the virulence factors of this fungal plant
pathogen from a population genomic approach. Candi-
dates should have a good background in evolutionary
ecology and above all population genetics. Knowledge
on host parasite interactions would be appreciated. In-
terest (but not necessarily good skills) in molecular bi-
ology (next generation sequencing) is required.
The proposed project stand at the core of the joint unit
Tree-Microorganism interactions and lie at the interfaceof its two major teams “ecology and population biol-
ogy of tree fungal pathogens (directed by B. Mar¸ cais)
and ”eco-genomic“ (directed by F. Martin). The ju-
nior scientist will thus beneﬁt from the complementary
skills and resources of these two teams, including ad-
vanced population genetics knowledge, large and histor-
ical population sampling on one hand and, on the other
hand, great genomic tool and molecular resources, in-
cluding genome sequence and transcriptomic analyses
performed on this model pathogen species.
The subject has been selected for application as
”Young scientist contracts“ which result from a part-
nership between INRA and graduate schools. These
contracts have initial duration of 3 years (PhD) and
can be renewed for 2 more years for a post doc project
(including necessarily a period of time abroad). Young
scientist contracts have very attractive remuneration
conditions. Before obtaining his/her PhD, the doctoral
student receives 2055? (gross) per month. After
obtaining his/her PhD, the remuneration is 2373?
(gross) per month. An annual bonus of 796? is paid
half-yearly. More details on young scientist contracts
can be found at http://www.international.inra.fr/-

young scientist contracts 1 Successful candidate
will be selected by an examination committee of
the graduate school RP2E (Nancy). All details on
how to apply can be found at (French and English
version underneath). http://www.rp2e.inpl-nancy.fr/-
index.php?id=5 The competitive examination is open
to any nationality. Dead line for application is May
15th. Position will start in fall 2010.
Don’t hesitate to contact me for any query
(halkett@nancy.inra.fr).
Below is the abstract of the subject I propose. The
ﬁeld of population genomics has recently emerged at
the cross between traditional population genetics and
the development of high-throughput techniques, with
the aim to decipher the strength of selection events on
genome evolutions. Although not yet widely applied
to plant pathology studies, these approaches seem par-
ticularly well suited to reveal the genetic bases of the
adaptive potential of fungal plant pathogens. While the
rapid pace of pathogen evolution (which result from in-
tensive selection pressure through the massive deploy-
ment of resistant genes) presents a major impediment
to sustainable agriculture, it also provides interesting
opportunities to better understand the evolutionary bi-
ology of host-parasite interactions. Here we want to ap-
ply the population genomic toolboxes to decipher the
evolution of virulence loci in the fungus responsible for
the poplar rust (Melampsora larici-populina). Deep-
ening into the genome’s organisation, the project will28 EvolDir May 1, 2010
successively try to (i) highlight genomic regions sub-
jected to a selective sweep caused by a drastic selection
event which was the overcoming of a major resistant
gene, (ii) point out the genes (among these region) un-
der positive selection, and putatively responsible for the
gene for gene interaction and (iii) study the evolution,
including recombination rate, of these genomic regions
implied in fungal pathogenicity. This project would
thus bring us fundamental knowledge on the genome
evolution of pathogens, which would help designing sus-
tainable strategies of crop protection.

KULeuven Belgium Cichlid
parasites
Dear Evoldir members,
4 YEAR PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY BI-
OLOGY Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
A 4 year PhD position for an evolutionary biologist is
immediately vacant at the Laboratory of Animal Diver-
sity and Systematics (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven
and the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren,
Belgium) in the research group of Prof. Filip Volck-
aert to study micro-evolutionary responses in Lake Tan-
ganyika cichlids.
Description: The project investigates the role of par-
asitism and immunogenetic adaptation in the diversi-
ﬁcation of Lake Tanganyika cichlids. Parasites may
play an important role in cichlid adaptive radiation
as they may inﬂuence both naturally and sexually se-
lected traits, speeding up the evolution of reproductive
isolation. Field studies, mate-choice experiments and
molecular work will be carried out to investigate par-
asite community structure, mating isolation, the po-
tential role of parasites in mate choice, and local im-
munogenetic adaptation (MHC). The comparison be-
tween cichlid species showing extreme versus no chro-
matic diﬀerentiation will clarify whether parasites, im-
munogenetic adaptation and colour polymorphism have
a synergistic eﬀect in cichlid mate choice. Evolution
of cichlids and their parasites has been studied in our
team over the past 3 years, while the Royal Museum
for Central Africa is a world expert in cichlid system-
atics (see http://bio.kuleuven.be/de/dev/pubs.php for
publications). The project starts on 01/04/2010 and
is supervised by prof. Filip Volckaert and dr. Joost
Raeymaekers.
The team: The Laboratory of Animal Diversity and
Systematics has a strong expertise in neutral and adap-
tive evolution of ﬁshes and their parasites, includ-
ing ﬁeld monitoring, experimental design, medium-
throughput genotyping, the analysis of genetic, ge-
nomic, and phenotypic data with up-to-date statisti-cal approaches. Topics addressed include phylogeny,
barcoding, phylogeography, population genetics, local
adaptation and rapid evolution (natural and ﬁsheries
induced), enhanced selection in aquaculture (aquacul-
ture genomics), co-evolution between host and parasite,
spatio-temporal dynamics of nursery grounds and the
management of aquatic habitats. Our team comprises
6 PhD students, 4 postdocs, 2 technicians and a team
leader. The historic KULeuven, founded in 1425, has
a very stimulating research environment. The modern
city of Leuven with its medieval roots oﬀers a high qual-
ity of life.
Proﬁle: High motivation, background in evolutionary
biology, interest or experience in ﬁeld based experimen-
tal research is strongly recommended. Research will
be carried out in collaboration with a multidisciplinary
team specialised in evolutionary biology, molecular par-
asitology and population genomics. Mate choice exper-
iments will be carried out at the University of Graz
(Prof. C. Sturmbauer).
Financing: The successful candidate is funded by a
national project (Research Fund - Flanders; salary of
approximately 1700 /month net). The candidate is ex-
pected to apply for a national Research Fund - Flanders
or IWT fellowship.

the quantitative and molecular genetics of individual
diﬀerences in traits related to sexual selection in zebra
ﬁnches, such as promiscuity, ornamentation and mor-
phology.
We seek a highly motivated individual who shares our
fascination with the diversity of personalities found in
animals and who has a background or strong inter-
est in some of the following ﬁelds: behavioural ecol-
ogy, evolution, quantitative genetics and molecular ge-
netics. Our research group within the Department of
Behavioural Ecology and Evolutionary Genetics at the
MPIO is focussed on the study of mating behaviour
and its genetic basis. We are interested in the study of
trade-oﬀs and antagonistic sexual selection by looking
at genetic correlations. Moreover, we combine QTL-
mapping with candidate gene approaches to identify the
underlying mechanisms. The work will involve measur-
ing behaviour, ornamentation and morphology in our
captive population of zebra ﬁnches that has been stud-
ied for 8 years, as well as in other captive populations
and potentially also in the wild (Australia). Further-
more the work involves running quantitative genetic
analyses (animal models), and creating and analysing
molecular data. Enthusiasm, reliability and commit-
ment will be more important than experience in those
tasks listed. The PhD student will be expected to work
independently as well as contributing to the research
of the group. Initial appointment will be for three
years with a possible extension for another year sub-
ject to research progress. Payment will be through a
Max Planck PhD stipend. The Max Planck Society
is an equal opportunity employer and encourages dis-
abled persons to apply. The Society aims at increasing
the number of women in ﬁelds where they are under-
represented, and therefore encourages them to apply.
Applications should include a concise statement of re-
search interests and work experiences relevant to the
project, curriculum vitae and contact details for 2-3
academic references. Please send your application as a
single ﬁle (Word-doc or pdf) before June 1st, 2010 (but
late applications may be considered) to our secretary
Carmen Dobus (cdobus@orn.mpg.de). For further in-
formation please do not hesitate to contact Wolfgang

EvolutionaryGenet
PhD student ’ Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology.
We have an opening for a PhD student in the Depart-
ment of Evolutionary Genetics at the Max Planck In-
stitute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.
The main focus of our lab is to shed light on the
role that natural selection has played in the evolu-
tion of humans and other primates, and to under-
stand the phenotypic consequences of selected genetic
variants. We work towards the identiﬁcation and
characterization of genes evolving under natural se-
lection, through both genome-wide analyses and de-
tailed evolutionary and experimental approaches. The
PhD student will work, broadly, on a project to
study the inﬂuence of balancing selection in the hu-
man genome. The project is primarily based on data
analysis of genome-wide and targeted diversity data,
although a component of web lab (data production
and/or functional assays) can be integrated. The stu-
dent may also contribute to other ongoing projects in
the lab and the department ( http://www.eva.mpg.de/-
genetics/ﬁles/population genomics.html ).
We are seeking a creative and highly motivated in-
dividual with a prime interest in population genetics
and evolutionary biology. Candidates should have a
bachelor1s or a master1s degree in biology, evolutionary
biology, population genetics, bioinformatics, computa-
tional biology, statistics, or related disciplines. Pre-
vious research experience, programming skills, and a
strong background in population genetics, evolutionary
biology, or statistics are a plus.
The student would be a graduate of the Leipzig
School of Human Origins ( http://imprs.eva.mpg.de/-
start.html ), a multi-disciplinary program jointly run by
the University of Leipzig and the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The Department
of Evolutionary Genetics is a lively, stimulating, and
highly collaborative place at the front of primate evo-
lutionary genomics ( http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics ).May 1, 2010 EvolDir 31
The Institute is very international and English speak-
ing. It is located in Leipzig, a nice and aﬀordable city
of 500,000 habitants that is the capital and major cul-
tural center of German Saxony. Leipzig is at driving
distance of Berlin (2 hours) and Prague (3 hours).

PhD Student Position - Population Genomics
A 3-year PhD student position in Population Genomics
is available in the newly formed lab of Dr. Oskar Hal-
latschek at the Max-Planck-Institute for Dynamics and
Self-Organization in G¨ ottingen. The student will join
a young and interactive research group in evolution-
ary dynamics and biophysics, including theoreticians
and experimentalists. We cultivate an international at-
mosphere and the everyday working language is En-
glish. The Max-Planck-Institute for Dynamics and Self-
Organization is located close to the center of the me-
dieval town of G¨ ottingen. More information about the
group is available on the web at: www.evo.ds.mpg.de
The goal of the P.h.D. project is to quantify genetic
footprints of natural selection and demographic revo-
lutions, and how they can be disentangled from one
another: Kimura’s neutral theory dominated the ﬁeld
of population genetics as long as sequence data was a
rare commodity. The recent years of whole genome se-
quencing revealed quite surprisingly that standard neu-
tral models rarely explain observed polymorphism data
well. Many researchers take these deviations as ubiq-
uitous signatures of acting natural selection. However,
although standard neutral models seem to be a poor
null model, the new interpretation in terms of natural
selection is far from straight forward. Most models of
natural selection make even more stringent assumptionsthan neutral models, such as panmixia, demographic
equilibrium and negligible epistatic interactions. These
simpliﬁcations could well have dropped the baby with
the bath water.
The situation clearly indicates that genetic data min-
ing is ahead of our theoretical understanding of the
how molecular evolution works (“population genetics
was much more fun in lack of genetic data”, Whitlock).
What could replace the neutral theory as a null model
of molecular evolution? The P.h.D. student will join our
group eﬀort to develop a new null model, which could
well dependent on the species. Speciﬁcally, he or she
will search for new sensible ways to disentangle natural
selection from a typically unsteady demographic his-
tory. The project will pay attention to spatial aspects of
evolution, epistatic selection and the previously unseen
types and amounts of data of the coming years. Prior
experience in population genetics modeling, molecular
evolution or comparative genomics is helpful but not
necessary.
The appointment will be on a temporary basis for
a maximum of 4 years. The gross salary starts at
approximately 1400,- per month depending on age
and experience (TV¨ oD 13/2, Stufe 1). The student
is encouraged to apply at the G¨ ottingen Graduate
School for Neurosciences and Molecular Biosciences
(GGNB, http://www.ggnb.uni-goettingen.de/ ). Appli-
cants should have a master’s degree or equivalent in
biology, math, physics, or related ﬁelds. If you hold an
excellent BSc (1st class honors) please contact us about
possible accession. German is not required but inter-
national students will be oﬀered opportunities to take
German courses. Interested candidates should send a
cover letter summarizing their research background and
interest in the position, CV, and contact information
of two potential referees as a single PDF ﬁle to: os-

with relevance for human health; a synergistic study
of plague and Lyme borreliosis. The focus of the PhD
project will primarily be on Lyme borreliosis. In much
of Europe with recent climate change and increases
in deer abundance, ticks are spreading into new ar-
eas. Ticks can carry and transmit several agents of dis-
eases (e.g., Lyme borreliosis and anaplasma). The re-
cent spread and increased abundance of ticks is a major
concern for human and animal welfare. It is therefore
urgent to improve our understanding of the factors de-
termining tick distribution and infestation load. From
an ecological and wildlife perspective, ticks are also in-
teresting as parasites in general can be an important
factor for density dependent eﬀects in animal popula-
tions. The aim of the PhD study is to (1) quantify
the distribution of ticks in landscapes along the west
coast of Norway relative to habitat (altitude, distance
to coast, forest cover etc.), to determine (2) how distri-
bution of ticks relates to migration and space of red deer
and (3) how these patterns in turn explain variation in

Impacts of group living on primate population dynam-
ics and extinction risk
Applications are invited for a 3-year PhD fellowship to
study impacts of group living on primate population
dynamics and extinction risk.
The present PhD proposal is part of a wider researchMay 1, 2010 EvolDir 33
programme on Allee eﬀects that is co-ordinated by
Franck Courchamp (ANR PEXT 010 03 - RARE -
Research on Allee and Rarity Eﬀects). The project
is integrated in Task 2 : Allee Eﬀect and Social Sys-
tems. This task focuses speciﬁcally on how individ-
ual behavioural processes build up to population-scale
phenomena. We propose an approach based on generic
population dynamics models derived from ’ﬁrst princi-
ples’ operating at the individual level. This approach is
largely based on the work previously developed by our-
selves (Bessa-Gomes, 2004; Bessa- Gomes et al., 2003a,
2003b; Deygout et al., in press), and combines diverse
types of models (matrix population models, branching
processes, and individual based models). Other than
explicitly accounting for behaviour, the general mod-
elling framework also accounts for variation among in-
dividuals, namely in terms of their age, sex, and both
social and breeding status. Although this work will
generate general principles of wide application, we pro-
pose to use primates as main model systems, in col-
laboration with Dr Guy Cowlishaw (Institute of Zo-
ology, London). Primates are an ideal model system
to study group living consequences for population dy-
namics as they are among the most intensely social of
all vertebrate species (which, linked to the threatened
status of many species, makes them particularly vulner-
able to Allee eﬀects). Their social structure in general,
and foraging strategies in particular, are well-studied
(thus providing the necessary data for model parame-
terisation). Finally, over half of all primate species are
threatened with global extinction (making this work of
urgent practical value).
We expect that the PhD candidate may address the
following questions: can group living in Primates lead
to an Allee eﬀect? To what extent this eﬀect im-
pacts species response to anthropogenic response, in
particular, deforestation? To answer this questions, the
PhD candidate is expected to combine two levels of ap-
proach: behavioural population models and compara-
tive analysis.
Prospective candidates should have a keen interest in
behavioural ecology, population dynamics and conser-
vation science. They also need to really enjoy mod-
elling, as most of the time that’s what you’ll be doing.
Previous knowledge of R, C++ or Java are a plus.
Please send your application to Carmen.Bessa-

Attach a CV (with possible publications included), con-
tact details of two references, and a letter (max 2 pages)

Poitiers France MicrobialDiversity
PhD position in Poitiers: microbial diversity associated
with arthropods
The project will concern the characterization of the
symbiotic communities of arthropods. Symbiosis con-
stitutes a major evolutionary strength in the history
of life [1]. If Wolbachia remains the most frequent
endosymbiont in arthropods, recent studies show that
the presence of other bacteria, the eﬀects of which are
still unknown, was probably underestimated [2]. Wol-
bachia are widespread (prevalence ~62 %) in isopods
and are involved in major host evolutionary changes
[3]. Moreover Wolbachia induce an immunodepression
in their hosts [4], so facilitating the establishment of
opportunistic bacteria. Even if some pathogenic bacte-
ria were described [5], the main part of the symbiotic
community remains largely unknown in isopods.
The PhD project aims at a characterization of the mi-
crobes associated with Armadillidium vulgare and re-
lated species. This pill bug is one of the best studied or-
ganisms in the laboratory. Recent unpublished results
show that endosymbionts (sex parasites or pathogenic
bacteria) others than Wolbachia, are also present in this
host. The project is part of EndoSymbArt and AdaWol
ANR projects oﬀering a stimulating research environ-
ment. It involves direct collaboration with members
of the lab and with research groups in France. The
project will start in October 2010. The PhD position
will be will be granted (salary 1757 euros per month)
by the CNRS (National Center for Scientiﬁc Research)
(http://www2.cnrs.fr/DRH/doctorants-10/ ).
The successful applicant must hold a Biology M.S. de-
gree or equivalent. A strong background in bacteria-
invertebrates symbiotic interactions will be appreci-
ated, as well as in molecular biology and DNA se-
quence handling. Skills in AFLP Ampliﬁed Fragment-
Length Polymorphism, TGGE Temperature Gradient
Gel Electrophoresis, FISH Fluorescent in situ Hy-
bridization, Quantitative PCR constitute a plus. The

PhD position: Wolbachia-Arthropods Interactions,
LEES Poitiers (France)
Topic: In situ approaches of Arthropods-symbionts in-
teractions: symbionts regulation
Wolbachia is the most widespread endosymbiotic bac-
terium in Arthropods, and therefore a perfect candi-
date for biological pest control strategies based on sym-
bionts, coined SyBaP (Symbiont-Based Protection).
Such applications rely on the controlled infection of
hosts with natural Wolbachia strains. The latter must
persist and remain conﬁned within target hosts and
host populations. The understanding of the mecha-
nisms that regulate Wolbachia populations within their
hosts is therefore an essential prerequisite.
Our main model is the Wolbachia/Armadillidium vul-
gare (woodlouse) symbiosis. The Wolbachia manipu-May 1, 2010 EvolDir 35
late host sex-ratio by feminizing genetic males. They
mainly colonize the ovaries and the nerve cord, but also
the immune system (hemocytes, hematopo¨ ıetic organs).
Their biovolume per cell, quantiﬁable through Fluores-
cence in situ Hybridization (FISH), is very heteroge-
neous even within one organ. To identify genes involved
in the symbiosis, several ESTs libraries have been con-
structed (ANR EndoSymbArt, subtracted cDNA li-
braries, bacterial challenges). The cDNAs have been
aﬃliated to potential metabolic pathways (GO terms).
The successful applicant will take part in the selec-
tion of genes of interest involved in the metabolic path-
ways of processes inﬂuenced by the symbiosis: host im-
mune response, development (embryogenesis, gonado-
genesis), Wolbachia tolerance (host-symbiont commu-
nication, cellular stress, tropism). The place of these
genes within the metabolic chains will designate them
as privileged markers for the corresponding pathway.
After checking their expression in target tissues by RT-
qPCR, the successful applicant will quantify their ex-
pression in situ, at the cellular level. The ﬂuctuation
of Wolbachia biovolume will oﬀer a natural series to
highlight dose eﬀects and expression thresholds. For all
this the successful applicant will develop a mRNA ﬂu-
orescence detection protocol compatible with the Wol-
bachia FISH detection.
The laboratory of “Ecology, Evolution, Symbiosis”
(LEES) located at the University of Poitiers is a CNRS-
University mixed research unit (UMR 6556). Our re-
search activities revolve around the general theme of
host-parasite associations and, more speciﬁcally, the
interactions between isopod crustaceans and their in-
tracellular bacteria Wolbachia. Two programs funded
by the National Research Agency (Agence Nationale de
la Recherche, ANR) are related with the proposed Ph.
D. project. EndoSymbArt (EndoSymbiosis in Arthro-
pods) aims to decipher the genetic, molecular and cel-
lular bases that drive the dynamics and the evolution of
bacterial symbioses in Arthropods. ADaWOL (Adap-
tive Success of Wolbachia in Arthropods) investigates
host predisposition toward new Wolbachia strains ant
Wolbachia abilities to switch hosts.
A three-year research grant is attached to the Ph.
D. project, within the Doctoral School “Environmen-
tal Sciences” Gay Lussac ( http://gaylussac.ed.univ-
poitiers.fr ). The successful applicant must hold a Bi-
ology M.S. degree or equivalent. A strong background
in bacteria-invertebrates symbiotic interactions will be
appreciated, as well as in molecular biology and DNA
sequence handling. Skills in ﬂuorescence microscopy
and even Fluorescence in situ Hybridization constitute
a plus. The application should be written in English
and should include personal information/background,a detailed CV with a summary of research experiences,
and at least one reference letter. Applications should
be sent to: joanne.bertaux@univ-poitiers.fr
Application deadline: 12/05/2010.

RiceU PlantEvolution
My lab is broadly interested in the evolution and
conservation of plants, often focusing on plant hy-
bridization and mating patterns. My research program
broadly aims to understand the evolutionary conse-
quences of global climate change, species invasions, and
species rarity. More speciﬁcally, I study (1) the mech-
anisms regulating genetic diversity, phenotypic evolu-
tion, and population demography in rare and inva-
sive plants and (2) how evolutionary processes (hy-
bridization, adaptation) and properties (mating sys-
tems, genetic diversity) aﬀect the ecological function
of plant populations (e.g., reproduction, extinction).
As such, my research touches on a variety of sub-
disciplines, including conservation biology, agricultural
ecology, and population dynamics using a combination
of ﬁeld, greenhouse, and eco-informatic approaches.
Students are expected to develop their own indepen-
dent projects but will also have opportunities to collab-
orate on funded investigations of hybridization in North
American agricultural and natural plant ecosystems.
Ryersons Chemistry and Biology department program
boasts an exceptionally active and growing faculty. Ar-
eas of emphasis include environmental and molecular
biology. Financial support is available for graduate stu-
dents.
I am accepting applications from prospective MSc or
PhD students to start a graduate program in Septem-
ber 2010. If you are interested, please email me
(lgc@rice.edu) a statement of your research interests
with your CV and the names and email addresses of at
least 2 references.

M.S. Graduate Assistantship Available in Evolutionary
Genetics at South Dakota State University
One graduate assistantship is available to support a
M.S. student interested in the genetic analysis of sick-
leweed (Falcaria vulgaris, Apiaceae) in North America.
Sickleweed is a common weed native to Europe and
western Asia. Little is known of its biology and eco-
logical genetics in North America and its native range
in Eurasia. During the past two decades, sickleweed
has rapidly invaded 3240 ha of mixed grass prairie on
the Fort Pierre National Grassland (FPNG) in central
South Dakota. Research goals are to 1) study genetic
diversity of sickleweed in North America and in its
source populations in Eurasia, (2) determine the source
and frequency of introduction and 3) combine genetic
data with ecological data to understand the role of ge-
netics in successful spread of this exotic species in North
America.
The position will be located at South Dakota State
University in the laboratory of Dr. Madhav Nepal.
The project involves sample collections in the ﬁeld and
molecular work in the laboratory. Applicants must be
enthusiastic, highly motivated and capable of working
independently. Prior experience with DNA extraction,
PCR and genotyping using molecular marker is a plus.
The Start date is January 2011 (spring semester). To
apply, please email a curriculum vitae, a one-page state-
ment of relevant experience, and the names and email
addresses of three references to: Dr. Madhav Nepal

PhD position in Kiel: microbial diversity associated
with nematodes
The PhD project aims at a characterization of the mi-
crobes associated with the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans and related species across diﬀerent locations in
Germany. This nematode is one of the best studied or-
ganisms under laboratory conditions; yet we still lack
understanding of the conditions under which it lives in
nature, including its microbial associates. Such infor-
mation is essential for full understanding of the biol-
ogy of this organism, including the exact function of its
generally well characterized genes. The project is part
of the European ESF Eurocores initiative on Ecolog-
ical and Evolutionary Functional Genomics and it in-
volves direct collaboration with research groups in The
Netherlands, Belgium, and France.
This speciﬁc PhD position (payment through the DFG
according to 13 TV-L/2) will be based in the recently
founded Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Ge-
netics at the University of Kiel (Northern Germany),
headed by Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schulenburg. The depart-
ment itself provides an international and interactive at-
mosphere, while Kiel University and connected insti-
tutes (e.g., Max Planck Institute in Ploen) oﬀer a stim-
ulating research environment with a particular focus on
evolutionary biology and also C. elegans genetics. The
city of Kiel is a medium-sized pleasant town located at
the coast of the Baltic Sea. It is the capital of the most
Northern state of Germany, Schleswig-Holstein. It of-
fers many opportunities for leisure activities, including
theatres, an opera, the Schleswig-Holstein classical mu-
sic festival, the heavy metal festival in Wacken, sailing,
surﬁng, cycling, and the famous festivities of the “Kieler

Evolutionary biology is facing important challenges
which include the demonstration of the actual role
and extension of hybridization and polyploidy in
past and present animal diversiﬁcation. Comparative
genome analysis has opened new insights into these old
paradigms, still almost only recognized with a primary
role in plants evolution. Unlike previous karyotyping
even by chromosome banding, which did not allow the
detection of intergenomic diﬀerentiation, comparative
genome analysis by GISH (Genomic In Situ Hybridiza-
tion) has opened remarkable perspectives to disclosure
genome restructuring in allopolyploids. By applying
this technique to the hybridogenetic S. alburnoides ﬁsh
complex, our main goal is to investigate genome in-
teractions and contribute to clear up the dynamics of
non-sexual genomes. We are currently looking for a
motivated student, who would like to integrate such
ongoing research project in molecular cytogenetics.

Inferring the history of human populations using

DNA polymorphism data allow the inference of some
aspects of the history of human populations. Various
methods have been developed, in particular the coa-

such as migration or population growth and inferring
their chronology, using genetic polymorphism within
DNA sequences, SNPs and microsatellites. Other

havioural Ecology of House Sparrows - Univ. Sheﬃeld,
UK / Univ. Otago, NZ
Both PhD students will work as a team on two dif-
ferent topics, using our house sparrow population on
Lundy Island - either on “personality and ﬁtness conse-
quences” or “extra-pair paternity and promiscuity net-
works”. There are no nationality restrictions for these
PhD positions.
We are also seeking a ﬁeld assistant in the same project
(June - August 2010).
Requirements: We are seeking motivated and indepen-
dent team players to join our house sparrow research
group. The ﬁeldwork on Lundy Island will conducted
for 4 months per year, requiring committed and col-
laborative individuals. Ideally, you have previous re-
search experience, ﬁeldwork experience, and are inter-
ested in birds and behavioural ecology. Experience in
handling birds and/or a ringing licence are an advan-
tage. For the ﬁeld assistant position, they are a require-
ment. Funding for one PhDstudent is already available
and for the second PhD position the amount of funding
is dependent on the academic record of the applicant.
The graduate positions are for 3 years, with a ﬂexi-
ble starting date before January 2011. The supervisors
are Prof. Terry Burke, Dr. Julia Schroeder (Sheﬃeld
University) and Dr. Shinichi Nakagawa (Otago Uni-
versity, NZ). For any further questions, contact ju-
lia.schroeder@sheﬃeld.ac.uk.
Project 1: Personality and reproductive success in a
wild passerine species In behavioural and evolution-
ary biology, there has been a recent explosive interest
in the phenomenon known as behavioural syndromes
(i.e., animal personality or consistent behavioural dif-
ferences between individuals across diverse contexts).
A realisation of the ubiquity of behavioural syndromes
in the wild has shaken the traditional view of animal be-
haviour in which behavioural phenotypes are expected
to be inﬁnitely ﬂexible so as to be adaptive in any given
context. Despite much interest in animal personality re-
search, very little is yet known about how diﬀerent per-
sonalities can aﬀect the ﬁtness of animals. We will use
a long-term monitored population of house sparrows
on Lundy Island to investigate the link between ﬁtness
and personality in the wild. There are ﬁve personality
traits recognised: activity, boldness, exploration, ag-
gressiveness and sociability. We will particularly fo-
cus on the ﬁrst three personality traits. Our previous
studies have demonstrated that two behavioural traits,
parental care and ﬁdelity (quantiﬁed by extra-pair mat-
ing), are repeatable within individuals, meaning, for ex-
ample, that some individuals express consistently highMay 1, 2010 EvolDir 45
parental care or that others are successful at gaining
extra-pair paternity through their lifetime. Obviously
these two traits have signiﬁcant ﬁtness consequences.
A critical feature of this study is that al individuals are
monitored through time and DNA proﬁling will be used
to conﬁrm the pedigree. Consequently, it will be possi-
ble to attach precise ﬁtness measures to alternative be-
haviours. The project will therefore be among the ﬁrst
to investigate intricate interactions among these ﬁtness-
related behavioural traits (parental care and mate ﬁ-
delity) and personality traits (e.g., activity, boldness
and exploration).
Please provide us with your application online (CV,
letter of motivation and two references). Only applica-
tions made through the university application system
can be considered. When applying, please mention as

postgraduate/research/apply Project 2: Understand-
ing “promiscuity” networks in a socially monogamous
species Our understanding of mating systems has dra-
matically changed with an introduction of molecular
paternity identiﬁcation methods, especially in avian
species where more than 90% of species were previ-
ously thought to be monogamous. Extra-pair paternity
(EPP) is ubiquitous in socially monogamous species.
Despite more than 20 years of relevant research, the
drivers of extra-pair paternity are still not well under-
stood. One reason for this may be that most stud-
ies fail to consider all the parties involved in EPP:
cuckolds (social males), adulteresses (social females),
extra-pair males and extra-pair females (partners of
extra-pair males). We propose to the quantify ﬁtness
consequences of all these four parties by utilising so-
cial network analysis in conjunction with traditional
regression-type approaches. Social network analysis has
recently gained popularity in studying animal societies,
although it has been a common tool in social sciences.
This method has the potential to eluc idate “promiscu-
ity” networks in a socially monogamous species. The
study will combine experimental approaches in the ﬁeld
with the analysis of a long-term dataset from an island

The project is at Section of Ecology, Dept. Biol., Univ.
Turku, Finland (ﬁnanced by the Finnish Cultural Foun-
dation, etc. in 2010-2011).
We have >25-yr data from fecundity (clutch size, repro-
ductive success and age of ﬁrst reproduction), natal and
breeding dispersal distances, juvenile and adult survival
as well as diet composition of Tengmalmˆ as owls and
Eurasian kestrels in two large study areas in western
Finland. In addition, we have >20-yr data from breed-
ing densities, reproduction rate and diet of short-eared
and long-eared owls. The density estimates of main
prey species of owls and kestrels have been also col-
lected, and data from changes in habitat composition
and weather conditions are also available. Therefore,
these data will yield an unique possibility to compre-
hensively analyse eﬀects of long-term spatio-temporal
variation of the environment on numerical and func-
tional responses of owls and kestrels. This may provide
new insights for understanding ecological processes be-
hind population dynamics.46 EvolDir May 1, 2010

PhD position at Wageningen University (Netherlands):
-Genomic changes during domestication and selection
of the pig’
The PhD-project -Genomic changes during domesti-
cation and selection of the pig’is part of the research
project “Molecular characterization of genetic factors
in the pig under selection during speciation, domesti-
cation and breeding (acronym: SelSweep). This project
is a prestigious grant funded by the European Research
Council (for more information see www.wi.wur.nl/-
UK/newsagenda/news/p100124.htm ). The ERC is
the ﬁrst European funding body set up to support
investigator-driven frontier research. Its main aim is to
stimulate scientiﬁc excellence by supporting the very
best, truly creative scientists, to be adventurous and
take risks in their research. The scientists are encour-
aged to go beyond established frontiers of knowledge
and the boundaries of disciplines. Within the project
the PhD student will be closely collaborating with two
other PhD students and two post-docs all based at the
Animal Breeding and Genomics Centre of Wageningen
University ( www.abg.wur.nl ).
During the past decade, there has been an increasing
interest in detecting genes and genomic regions that
harbor regulatory elements responsible for complex dis-
ease in human and for phenotypic variation in other
organisms. Ever since Darwin, domesticated species
have served as models for understanding phenotypic
change due to selection. The pig was domesticated
around 9000 years ago from Sus scrofa, the wild boar, in
multiple geographic distinct regions of the world. Fol-
lowing their domestication and subsequent episodes of
selective breeding, domestic animal species have expe-
rienced strong selective pressure directed at genes con-
trolling traits of biological, agricultural or health im-
portance. An important and intriguing question that48 EvolDir May 1, 2010
you will address is, what regions and genes are aﬀected
during early domestication and breed formation. You
will seek to answer this question by comparing complete
genomic sequences of over 100 wild and domesticated
pigs.
Animal breeders have been extremely successful in
shaping natural variation by applying selection. Identi-
ﬁcation of regions that show evidence of selection within
established commercial breeding lines allows a further
level of resolution in the analysis of genomic regions un-
der selection. Such footprints of selection are expected
to be subtle, but provide an actual glimpse of the re-
gions and genes aﬀecting traits of importance for do-
mestication and to current commercial breeding. This
part of the project will be performed in close collabo-
ration with the pig breeding industry, i.e The Institute
for Pig Genetics in the Netherlands.
The animal breeding and genomics group is one of the
world’s leading groups in animal genomics and this
project builds upon an international collaboration to
sequence the porcine genome and to characterize the ge-

PhD position at Wageningen University (Netherlands):
-Statistical analysis of whole genome re-sequencing
data’
The PhD-project -Statistical analysis of whole genome
re-sequencing data’ is part of the research project
“Molecular characterization of genetic factors in the pig
under selection during speciation, domestication and
breeding (acronym: SelSweep). This project is a pres-
tigious grant funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (for more information see www.wi.wur.nl/UK/-
newsagenda/news/p100124.htm ). The ERC is the ﬁrst
European funding body set up to support investigator-
driven frontier research. Its main aim is to stimulate
scientiﬁc excellence by supporting the very best, truly
creative scientists, to be adventurous and take risks in
their research. The scientists are encouraged to go be-
yond established frontiers of knowledge and the bound-
aries of disciplines. Within the project the PhD stu-

New sequencing technologies are currently truly trans-
forming biological and medical research. The availabil-
ity of complete genome sequences of many individuals of
a species or population oﬀers, a unique view on the vari-
ation that determines why two individuals are diﬀerent.
However, researchers around the globe are currentlyMay 1, 2010 EvolDir 49
also facing the challenge of an exhausting interpreta-
tion of all this information. Within the ERC SelSweep
project the genomes of more than 100 individual pigs
will be completely characterized to answer questions re-
lated to speciation, domestication and selection. The
analysis of such data sets and the identiﬁcation of seg-
mental duplications, SNPs and structural variants oﬀer
signiﬁcant computational and analytical challenges. In
a team of bioinformaticians and evolutionary genome
researchers, you will focus on the implementation, de-
velopment and use of tools and concepts to analyse all of
that sequence data to its fullest biological extent. Par-
ticular emphasis will be on elucidating signatures of se-
lection in the genome, on estimating past demographic
parameters such as population bottlenecks, and on in-
terpretation of patterns of divergence between wild and
domesticated animals within the species Sus scrofa, but
also between Sus scrofa and related pig species.
The animal breeding and genomics group is one of the
world’s leading groups in animal genomics and this
project builds upon an international collaboration to
sequence the porcine genome and to characterize the ge-
netic diversity of the pig worldwide. Within the project
you will closely collaborate with international experts

One of the most important questions in evolutionary
biology pertain the mechanisms leading to speciation.
The genetics behind these mechanisms is poorly under-
stood. The fast pace of development in sequence tech-
nology now allows studying these long-standing ques-
tions from an evolutionary genomics perspective: what
changes in the genome result in sexual incompatibil-
ity and how does the genome change in response to
changing environment of the diﬀerent species? The pig
(Sus scrofa) is the best known member of a group of
closely related species all belonging to the Suidae fam-
ily consisting of at least 12 diﬀerent species. In this
project you will analyse whole genome sequence data
for at least 4 diﬀerent pig species. For each species
multiple individuals will be sequenced to identify the
genetic variation within each of these species. Speciﬁc
research questions you will address include: 1) what is
the underlying mechanisms and genomic changes that
lead to speciation and 2) can diﬀerences in the genomes
of these species explain the observed diﬀerences in mor-
phological and physiological between the species?

sions during the semester on Monday afternoons.
Prep component: The second set of duties associated
with the position is to assist in the preparatory work for
the teaching labs in Biology 101L, 102L, and the labo-
ratory diversity course, Biology 106L, as determined by
the Lab Administrator. Responsibilities include setting
up and putting away equipment and specimens for lab-
oratory exercises, maintaining supplies in lab rooms be-
tween sections, cleaning glassware, assisting with ﬁeld
collection of live specimens, and helping to care for a
diverse collection of invertebrate animals in salt-water
aquaria. The lab prep workload is likely to require

*(Birkbeck <http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ >, University of

Abstract: Life-history theory calls attention to across-
as well as within-species variation in reproductive
strategies. Three decades ago Draper and Harpend-
ing (1982) reinterpreted eﬀects of childhood father ab-
sence on adolescent sexual behaviour in reproductive
strategy terms. Belsky, Steinberg and Draper (1991)
subsequently expanded this framework to consider a
broader array of developmental experiences, highlight-
ing not just why but how early family experiences shape
psychological, somatic and reproductive development.
A critical and theoretically unique prediction was that
pubertal development would be accelerated in response
to a variety of family stressors. Research evaluating
this prediction is reviewed and new theoretical devel-
opments are discussed.

Evidence Evolution
Dear friends,

good websites discussing the evidences of evolution.Now I am using several of them in my classes and I
would like to share this material with all of you:

http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/-
section2.html#present biogeography http://-
www.talkorigins.org/faqs/wells/haeckel.html After
reading several of these material I am feeling that we
need more material not just describing WHAT is a
homology but also discussing HOW this can be used
as an evidence of biological evolution. Another point is
that it is very diﬁcult to ﬁnd material like this for kids
and this fact is showing us that we need more teaching
material about this subject. In another discussion in
the list I sent a suggestion about a slide and short
movies libary available for teachers and students. We
need to improve this....
Thanks to all people who sent me ideas and links :)

Genotype reconstruction answers
Several people requested the answers to my query about
software for conveniently reconstructing the genotypes
at each locus of the parents of a full sibship. Here is a
summary of what I learned.
MY ORIGINAL QUESTION: Hi, Has anyone written
a script to choose the most likely genotypes of the two
parents of a full-sibship from the genotypes of those sib-
lings? Here I want to pre-specify the sibships and just
reconstruct the most likely parental genotypes at each70 EvolDir May 1, 2010
locus. Thanks, Mike
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Ian Wilson’s PARENTAGE program seems like the
best way to go. It will also do sibship partitions with
genotyping error and a number of other useful proce-
dures.
PEDIGREE ( http://herbinger.biology.dal.ca:5080/-
Pedigree/ ) will do the trick but extracting your
parental genotypes out of the output is very labor
intensive if you have a large number of sibships.
Note that if you want to write your own script, the
equations for estimating the most likely parental geno-
types of a full sibship are presented in table 2 of Banks
et al., 2000. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic
Sciences 57:915-927.
Several people recommended COLONY but I don’t
think it will actually reconstruct both parental geno-
types (at least the latest version won’t) - if you try it,
you’ll see that it identiﬁes both parents as having the
same genotype. If I’m wrong about this, please let me
know.
Some other recommendations I got included the follow-
ing, but of the ones we checked into it wasn’t obvious
that they’ll do what we wanted.

Indonesian BiodiversityThrough funding from USAID a new Indonesian Biodi-
versity Research Center we be launched in June 2010,
located in Denpasar, Bali. The goal of this center is
to advance biodiversity research in Indonesia and to
foster collaboration between US and Indonesian scien-
tists. This center is a collaboration between UCLA, the
Smithsonian, Udayana University, Diponeogoro Univer-
sity, and the State University of Papua. The Center
will house a modest molecular laboratory and digital
microscopy facilities to support the research of both In-
donesian and U.S. faculty and students, and will have
personnel who can assist and provide guidance in nego-
tiating Indonesian permitting policies.
As part of the Center activities, a number of short
courses will be oﬀered each summer, including Molecu-
lar Ecology, Biodiversity Inventories, and Ichthyology.
These research based courses are being developed to
serve both US and Indonesian students and are de-
signed to facilitate the collection of preliminary data
that would help students develop research projects in
Indonesia.
To facilitate the involvement U.S. graduate students
this coming summer, there is a limited amount of fund-
ing to cover travel and subsistence costs for 3-4 stu-
dents. Interested students should send an email to Paul
Barber (paulbarber@ucla.edu) indicating their interest
in participating in this program, as well as a one page
description of their research interests and how partic-
ipating in this program would further their research
objectives.

Lyon SMBE WholeGenome
CallAbstracts
Dear Evoldir members,
This is a call for abstracts to be sumitted to the sym-
posium on “Whole genome sequencing in experimental
evolution” at the SMBE meetings this summer in Lyon,
France.
Abstracts are to be submitted through the con-
ference website: http://smbe2010.univ-lyon1.fr .
The abstract for the symposium (also available at
http://smbe2010.univ-lyon1.fr/en/pages/smbe2010-
whole-genome-sequencing-in-experimental-evolution )
is:
Modern sequencing methods ﬁnally allow the thorough
and unbiased detection of mutations in experimental
evolution systems. This allows both the quantitative
description of the molecular events involved but also
a qualitative understanding of the bases of adaptation
and a direct link to system biology in model organ-
isms. Our symposium will discuss current progress and
future prospects for experimental evolution in multi-
ple systems, including microorganisms as well as model
animal or plant genetic systems. We expect the sym-
posia speakers to give their thoughts on what “next-
generation” sequencing will reveal about the molecular
basis of adaptation, and what the diﬀerent challenges
are in diﬀerent systems.
Best,

3. venue availability,
4. why your institution is ideal for hosting MEEC 2011
5. brief details about possible interesting ﬁeld trip sites
near your institution
6. a short description about your intuitions’ ecology
and/or evolution program (research, academics, etc),
7. any pledged sponsorships obtained thus far,
8. any other information you feel might help us know
why your institution is the best host for MEEC 2011,
9. the typed signatures of the proposed MEEC2011 Organizing Committee Chairman and the Pres-
ident/Chairman of your proposed hosting student or-
ganization.
10. Please include your plans to integrate a sustainabil-
ity eﬀort with MEEC 2011.
In addition, the 2011 host will receive up to $5,000 in
carryover from MEEC 2010.
Please send your proposal via email to

MK-type tests
Dear Evoldir members,
I have a question about MK-type tests such as MKPRF,
where polymorphism data are used from only one
species (species 1), and are compared to the divergence
from a second (species 2): in this case is it reasonable
to perform the test in both directions, i.e. setting each
species to “species 1” and repeating the test? It seems
possible that diﬀerences at particular loci could occur
due to diﬀerent patterns of polymorphism in the two
lineages... but I have not seen this done in the litera-
ture.

Title of post: Next.Generation.In house.ComputingDear Evoldir’ers
What with costs of outsourcing the standard bioinfo-
matics needed for next gen data, quickly being able to
reach dizzing heights (I was just quoted 1000 Euros for
clustering and contig assembly for one cDNA library),
I wonder if any advice could be given on a decent pow-
erful set up for in-lab use?
The trade-oﬀ between computing time and accumulat-
ing outsourcing costs is important, yet would not be to
upset if it took one week for contig and clustering of a
cDNA library on our own machine.
Does anyone have a powerful setup of their own, which
is not an expensive cluster system, able to execute
the basic necessities e.g. alignments, BLASTs, SNP
searches?

There seems to be a few ways to tackle this dilemmas:
1. Outsource to a company/lab, with prices between
ranging dramatically 2. Utilize a cluster/server system
at your Institute or region: eg. AceNet. The speed of
processing largly depends on the amount of power you
are allocated. Some analyses may take a long time if
the cores are at capacity. 3. Purchase your own desktop
“super computer”, along with software. 4. Utilize a vir-
tual cloud system, for remote processing of data. This
however seems to be hampered only by the upload time
of your data, via the internet, into the system. Some
people have also had problems with the output ﬁles.
We have decided to go with our own desktop solution
(~$4000 CA), along with the CLC Genomics Work-
bench software ( ~$6000 US) for a number of reasons.
1. The software comes highly recommended and uti-
lizes high powered desktops fully, to for example iden-
tify SNPs in assembled cDNA libraries in around 30
mins (as opposed to days, stated by outsourced com-
panies). 2. We want to have hands on experience and
expertise within the lab. 3. Our own setup will stream-
line data processing and customization.
There seems to be a lot of people doing in-house anal-
yses, as such an array of software and a community for
support has cropped up:

Hi Jack,There is no need to spend $1000 doing a next-gen
cDNA assembly and shame on anybody who would even
charge that! For about $1500 you can put together
a Linux system to handle most of your bioinformatic
needs, including assembly. Really, any workstation will
do that has at least 8GB RAM and a quad core. What
sorts of data are you talking about - Illumina, SOLiD,
or 454? If you want to chat on the phone about assem-
bly strategies and necessary hardware feel free to give
me a call at 520-336-7592.
Best, Mike Barker

Dear Jack,
I bot myself a system built around an Asus Z8NA-D6
i5500 RGVA motherboard with 2 Intel Xeon processors.
You will have 2 Quad cores, that male 8 cores behaving
as one. These Intels are hyperthreaded, which means
they actually will behave like 16 processors. The whole
thing will be considerably cheaper than 5k Euro. It is
only one box, and will work nicely with standard Linux
ditributions. This is a standard ATX set-up with up
to 24 Gb of RAM. Please confront your local computer
store with these details and they can tell you more.
This is good enough to do everything you wish for, but
not yet whole genome de novo assembly of verebrate
sized genomes. For that you would need 256 or better
512 Gb RAM. This is only possible with server conﬁg-
urations, prices starting at around 30k Euro - and not
so easy to maintain...
More questions? Let me know.

Phyloseminar InﬂuenzaEvolution
Apr23
On April 23rd, phyloseminar.org will present Trevor
Bedford speaking on “Adaptation and migration in the
human inﬂuenza virus.” As always, the seminar will be
freely viewable by the public– see phyloseminar.org for
more information.
The talk will be at 13h PDT (West Coast USA), which
is 8h (on April 22nd) in Christchurch, NZ, 16h on the
East coast of the USA, 21h in the UK and 22h in Ger-
many.
Abstract: The inﬂuenza A virus infects approximately
500 million individuals each year. Owing to its RNA
makeup, inﬂuenza mutates extremely rapidly allowing
the virus population to escape the pull of the human
immune system. A single individual may be infected
year after year by antigenically novel strains. As re-
sult of this rate of mutation, the timescale of inﬂuenza
evolution is a human timescale. We get the chance to
observe the process of evolution in action. However,
the rapid pace of evolution also causes an intrinsic link
between evolutionary and ecological dynamics in the
virus population. The availability of temporally spaced
sequence data allows estimation of details of these dy-
namics unavailable in other systems. Through analysis
of this data, I address open questions regarding pat-
terns of adaptation and the eﬀects of seasonality in the
human inﬂuenza virus.

Software ComparativeGenomics
MANTiS-v1 1
Dear EvolDir member,
Version 1.1 of MANTiS (which now includes an auto-
update system) is available for download at:
http://www.mantisdb.org Check the update notes at
the very end of this message.
MANTiS is a comparative genomics application sys-
tem that builds a relational database integrating, in
an explicit phylogenetic framework, all Ensembl genes
(MANTiS covers now all recent ENSEMBL versions,
up to release 57), corresponding PANTHER molecu-
lar functions and biological processes, as well as ex-
pression data from various sources. MANTiS uses or-
tholog/paralog prediction and a dynamical program-
ming approach for the mapping of gene gains, duplica-
tions, and losses on the phylogenetic tree.
Through a user-friendly interface, MANTiS allows the
user to identify: ˆ a Gene gains and losses on speciﬁc
branches of the tree (but see Genome Biology, 2010 Feb,
11, 2, R16 ) ˆ a Genome content of ancestral species, ˆ a
Statistically over- or under-represented molecular func-
tions, biological processes and anatomical systems (ex-
pression data), see Genome Biololgy & Evolution 2010:
13-18 (2010) ˆ a Tissue speciﬁcity of gained, duplicated,
and lost genes.
Finally, the entire set of information available in MAN-TiS can be exploited further using an advanced system
of queries by which gene identity, mapping, and func-
tion parameters can be combined using logical opera-
tors.

What’s new in v1.1:
General - Loading of the data at the launch of MAN-
TiS is much faster - Expression data for EST and
GNF are no more recovered from Ensembl. EST
data is recovered from NCBI’s Unigene ( http://-
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene ) and GNF data is re-
covered from BioGPS ( http://biogps.gnf.org ). - MAN-
TiS covers now all recent ENSEMBL versions (up to re-
lease 57) WARNING: some of these versions of Ensembl
contain low-coverage (2X) genomes that generate large
artifacts in gene gains and losses; see: Milinkovitch

baldon 2X genomes - depth does matter Genome Biol-
ogy, 2010 Feb, 11, 2, R16
Interface -MANTiS requires now JAVA 6 or better -
MANTiS now uses the ’native skin’ instead of the ’java’
appearance.
Tools - There are new ’General statistics tools’, for ex-
ample, to assess patterns of changes in gene tissue speci-
ﬁcity along lineages: see Milinkovitch M.C., Helaers
R., & A.C. Tzika Historical Constraints on Vertebrate
Genome Evolution Genome Biololgy & Evolution 2010:
13-18 (2010) - New tool named “Restrict dataset to
duplicated genes”. It performs a restriction by keep-
ing only the characters coming from a duplication, ex-
cluding ’de-novo’ gains. This tool is available only in
the ’with duplications’ dataset and uses high amount
of memory, so it might be necessary to increase the
amount of memory assigned to MANTiS. - New tool
called ’set allowed memory’ for choosing the maximum
amount of RAM assigned to MANTiS. If you run MAN-
TiS on a 32-bit OS, you are limited to 2GB. If you78 EvolDir May 1, 2010
run MANTiS on a 64-bit OS, you are not limited in
the amount of allowable memory. - New identiﬁer con-
version tool from Entrez/Unigene to Ensembl for more
species.
Dataset -New ’Phylomedb 1’ dataset. A dataset
with a large number of species, all with high-coverage
genomes. See http://phylomedb.org for more details.

Software tinyFLP update
tinyFLP and tinyCAT are free programs for automatic
scoring of AFLP data generated with Applied Biosys-
tems instruments. (Arthofer 2010, Mol Ecol Res 10,
385-388). tinyFLP reads data tables exported from the
free PeakScanner software, performs binning and re-
turns a binary allele matrix. tinyCAT concatenates up
to 16 matrices derived from diﬀerent primer sets and
generates ﬁles in Fasta, Nexus, Structure and GenAlEx
format.
We announce a major update of both programs:
tinyFLP, now in version 1.1: * Ability to read 600bp
electropherograms (500 bp in v1.0) * Ability to identify
up to 600 peaks per trace (255 peaks in v1.0) * Im-
proved sliding-windows operation * Bugﬁx: presence of
larger peaks than 600 bp does not cause incorrect data
* Milliseconds added to timestamps * Improved error
messages in logﬁle
tinyCAT, now in version 1.0: * Output for Structure
software added * Output for diﬀerent programs is now
directed into diﬀerent ﬁles, no more need for copy-paste
* Ability to deal with 600bp traces and longer matrices
as produced by tinyFLP v1.1 * Milliseconds added to
timestamp
The new versions (Windows executable, source
code, manual) can be downloaded from http://-
sourceforge.net/projects/tinyﬂp/ (use the ’View all

USDA-ARS at Cornell University
Postdoctoral Position in Quantitative / Computational
Genetics for Plant Breeding
Genomic selection uses novel statistical approaches to
predict phenotype and breeding value from high den-
sity marker data. There is a current need for improved
computational methods in the face of increasing marker
densities and observation numbers. Many directions of
cutting edge research are open and with the data in
hand can rapidly lead to publications: - Scale-up ge-
nomic selection methods to datasets involving possibly
tens of thousands of lines and markers - Extend ge-
nomic selection methods to better design training pop-
ulations, reduce loss of genetic diversity, and capture
epistatic eﬀects - Develop and test methods of genomic
selection that use haplotype rather than single-marker
information - Propose and simulate breeding schemes
that introduce genomic selection predictions to acceler-
ate gains from breeding The posdoc will have available
extensive empirical datasets to validate results and tie
them to real, rather than simulated datasets. These
datasets include genotypes and phenotypes from the
Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project ( ~3,000 SNP
on~4,000 lines with extensive phenotypes); Genomic
selection validation data currently collected in barley
and winter wheat programs ( ~1500 SNP and DArT
markers on ~1000 lines including parents and progeny
from the two species); ongoing genomic selection for
quantitative disease resistance in barley.
To analyze these data, we are assembling and adapting
methods from plant, human and livestock genetics. We
are a pioneering lab in many of these methods and look
to train postdocs in the basics and perform research to
extend the analyses. The environment at Cornell in-
cludes nationally recognized research programs in pop-82 EvolDir May 1, 2010
ulation genetics, genomics and plant breeding, which
will provide additional resources and stimulation.
Preferred applicants should have a Ph.D. in quantita-
tive, population, or computational genetics and strong
background in statistics. US citizens or Green Card
holders are also preferred (certain other nationalities
may apply but initial employment will be delayed). An
excellent postdoctoral salary will be oﬀered.

The major goal of the current project is to utilize ex-
isting and recently developed genomic resources forMay 1, 2010 EvolDir 83
ﬁre ants (including full genome sequence of the sin-
gle species Solenopsis invicta) to conduct several of a
number of key evolutionary studies of these ants, such
as: comparative genetic studies seeking to identify por-
tions of the genome involved in the development of re-
productive isolation in order to understand the causes
of speciation in this ecologically important group of
ants; identiﬁcation of the factors promoting natural hy-
bridization between the two ﬁre ant species S. invicta
and S. richteri; ecological and evolutionary functional
genomics studies in an attempt to identify polymor-
phisms segregating at genes that aﬀect ecological and
evolutionary success in natural environments (as well as
the functional consequences of such variation); linkage
mapping and comparative population genomic studies
within and among species; studies of genomic sequences
for features of interest; or other molecular evolution-
ary studies of ﬁre ants (e.g., evolution of gene fam-
ilies, origin and fate of gene duplications) as well as
across Hymenoptera. The evolutionary genetics of in-
vasive species is a topic of enormous current interest.
Fire ants represent excellent models for these and other
evolutionary genomic studies given their complex social
behaviors and life histories, their stunning success as in-
vaders and the well documented genetic and ecological
changes that have taken place in invasive populations,
the extensive hybridization that occurs between some
species, and the ongoing need for studies aimed at de-
limiting species in this important group of insects.
QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Ph.D. in evolu-
tionary or population genetics/genomics or closely re-
lated discipline appropriate to the position. The ap-
plicant must have an interest in population and evolu-
tionary genetics and ideally would be familiarized with
bioinformatics approaches relating to population and
evolutionary genetics and have experience analyzing
next generation sequencing data. Candidates with ex-
perience in standard molecular genetic techniques (e.g.,
PCR, ﬂuorescent-based genotyping and next generation
DNA sequencing, gene expression, bioinformatics) or
large-scale data analyses (e.g. high-throughput geno-
typing, comparative genomics) are desired.
Funding is available for two years, with possible ex-
tension for an additional year, starting as early as
June 2010. Review of applications will start imme-
diately (send CV and supporting materials to: de-

MaxPlanck EvoBio Sterile Insect
Resistance
Postdoctoral position: Experimentally assessing the
feasibility of genetically engineered sterility in insect
populations.
A two-year postdoc position is available, to start im-86 EvolDir May 1, 2010
mediately, to screen for the evolution of resistance to
transgenic constructs which sterilize insects, in the pop-
ulation genetics group of the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Biology.
Classical sterile insect technique was developed in the
1950s to suppress pest insect populations in a response
to the widespread evolution of insecticide resistance.
Recently, a great deal of interest has turned towards the
use of genetically engineered sterility (e.g. Cyranoski,
2008, Sterile mosquitoes near take-oﬀ. Nature 453:435).
Funding has been obtained from the DFG (German na-
tional research foundation) to independently test for
and study the possible evolution of resistance to ster-
ilizing transgenes in laboratory populations. This will
be done in the Drosophila model with one of two ap-
proaches currently proposed for release (we already
have this system working in the lab).
I am looking for someone with a Ph.D. or equivalent
degree, with a high degree of familiarity in standard
molecular genetics laboratory experience (most impor-
tantly cloning, but also Southern-blotting and inverse-
PCR). Experience in working with Drosophila is not
essential and I would encourage applications from peo-
ple in any molecular biological ﬁeld who are willing to
think creatively and learn new techniques. I think this
is an exciting opportunity to contribute in a practical
way to an area that is likely to attract intense scientiﬁc
and public interest over the next 5 years because
of regulatory moves towards implementation of this
type of technology (see http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/-
EPA-IMPACT/2009/May/Day-07/i10633.htm and
http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/tendersawarded/-
tender/cftefsagmo200901.htm ). There will also be
opportunity to contribute to other projects within
my laboratory which are also focused on genetically
modifying pest populations for human health and
conservation purposes and the detection and analysis
of forms of positive selection.
I do not discourage anyone from applying based on age,
sex, race, political views, or nationality. Applicants will
be selected based on scientiﬁc merit. I also do not dis-
courage applicants from applying that may have con-
cerns over the possible applications of genetic pest man-
agement, as long as this enhances rather than inhibits
research and dialogue.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology is
located in Pl¨ on, Germany, near the Baltic coast be-
tween the northern German cities of Kiel and L¨ ubeck.
The institute has a diverse scientiﬁc environment which
also includes work on questions of evolution in, for
example, the mouse (recent adaptation), stickleback
(including host-parasite interactions), Cottus (hybridspeciation) and yeast (experimental evolution) sys-
tems with additional projects and groups focused on
evolutionary theory and bioinformatics. See http:/-
/www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/index.html for more in-
formation. The working language of the institute is
English.
Payment will be in the form of a stipend for 24 months
with a pay scale that is dependent on years of post-
doc experience, marital status and number of children,
approximately 2100 to 2800 Euros per month. The
stipend is tax free, but health insurance and retirement
contributions are not covered (private insurance is re-
quired).
Interested candidates should send an email message
with a statement of interest and experience, an at-
tached CV in PDF format and the names, aﬃliation
and email addresses of three potential references to

Rennes France QTLmapping
*Post-doctoral position in QTL mapping of reproduc-
tive strategies in the pea aphid, INRA Rennes, France*
A one year post-doctoral position is available
in a research laboratory, UMR BiO3P ( http://-
www.rennes.inra.fr/bio3p ), located near Rennes (Brit-
tany, France) and belonging to the French Institute for
Agriculture Research (INRA). This post-doc position is
funded by ANR (French Research Agency) and is part
of a project coordinated by the host team aimed at elu-
cidating the genetic and molecular basis of reproduc-
tive strategies in an important group of crop pests, the
aphids. Aphids are among the rare organisms capable
of shifting from clonal to sexual reproduction by using
the same genotype (phenotypic plasticity). Further-
more, sexual (cyclically parthenogenetic) and asexual
(obligately parthenogenetic) lineages frequently coexist
within the same species or even the same population
(genetic polymorphism). The scientiﬁc objective of the
post-doc fellowship is to identify through association
and quantitative genetics QTLs linked to reproductive
strategies in aphids. For that, a vast panel of F2 re-
sulting from crosses between sexual and partially asex-
ual lineages and for which phenotypic characterization
is ongoing, will be genotyped at several hundreds mi-
crosatellite markers already available in the lab. A link-
age map will be constructed and QTLs will be mapped.
Because this project is carried out on the pea aphid
for which the complete genome has been recently pub-
lished, genomic regions in the vicinity of QTLs will be
analyzed and the function of neighborhood genes will be
explored. The post-doctoral fellowship will be achieved
in a multidisciplinary and active research group includ-
ing population geneticists, genomicists, bioinformati-
cians, and modelers. This lab has full access to high
throughput genotyping, as it hosts the genotyping plat-
form of Biogenouest (life science core facility network).

UArkansas PlantEvolution
A postdoctoral position in plant evolutionary ecology
is available at the Department of Biological Sciences at
the University of Arkansas. The USDA-funded project
is evaluating mechanisms by which global change fac-
tors interact with population level phenomena to trig-
ger outbreak population dynamics. Of special inter-
est is the introduction and residence of transgenes in
naturalized weed populations by way of crop-weed hy-
bridization. We hypothesize that the risks of transgene
establishment will increase as beneﬁcial transgenes mi-
grate to naturalized or weedy species, and that risks
of genetic contamination will grow with escalating de-
mand for value-added agricultural products. The suc-
cessful applicant will be responsible for extended ﬁeld
work, greenhouse hybridization trials, and supervision
of students. Applicants must have a Ph.D. in a relevant
ﬁeld, such as ecology or evolutionary biology. Experi-
ence in DNA sequencing and analysis, phylogenetic and
phylogeographic analysis and plant hybridization ex-
pertise and expertise in statistical analysis is necessary.
Previous work with domesticated plants is a plus.The
initial appointment will be for one year with the pos-
sibility of extension. The deadline for applications is
1 May or until the position is ﬁlled. To apply, send a

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position
in evolutionary systems biology at the Laval Uni-
versity Institute for Integrative and Systems Biology
(IBIS)(Quebec, Canada) to study how natural genetic
variation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
aﬀects evolutionarily and ecologically important traits.
The successful candidate will study the genetic archi-
tecture, evolution and robustness of signalling networks
using the budding yeast and its close relatives as mod-
els. The last decade has seen exponential growth in
the pace of DNA sequencing and revolutions in mi-
croscopy, computing, and molecular visualization tech-
niques. These advances have made it possible to dissect
the inner workings of cells as they respond to internal or
external cues. Despite the wealth of new data produced
by these technologies, it remains remarkably diﬃcult to
predict how mutations or recombination aﬀect complex
physiological and morphological traits. Understand-
ing how genetic variation is converted into observable
diﬀerences between organisms is crucial for developing
personalized medical treatments, bioengineering cellu-
lar machines or fuels, and predicting the evolutionary
potentials of diﬀerent alleles. Several levels of organiza-
tion (gene expression, protein localization, posttransla-
tional modiﬁcations, protein-protein interactions) will
be studied in order to construct genotype-phenotype
maps of complex phenotypic responses. The project
will be tailored according to the fellows interest.
This project is a collaboration involving Dr Scott
Rifkin (University of California San Diego, USA) and
Dr Madan Babu (University of Cambridge, UK) and
is funded by the Human Frontier Science Program
(HFSP).
Applicants must hold a PhD in biology or in a related
discipline. The candidate should have strong experi-
ence in molecular biology and preferably also in mi-
crobiology. Experience with high throughput screening
and genotyping, statistics and yeast genetics would be
an asset.
Universit Laval is one of the ﬁrst higher education insti-
tution in the Americas and is one of the leading univer-
sities in Canada. Located in Quebec City, a UNESCO

lacking. In this project we have used high-throughput
sequencing (Roche 454) to sequence the great tit tran-
scriptome and mine many thousands of SNPs. We will
shortly be typing 10,000 SNPs in several thousand birds
to build a linkage map and then perform quantitative
trait /genome wide association mapping. Genotyp-
ing will be outsourced. We will then use QTL map-
ping approaches to address questions relevant to mi-
croevolution. For example publications from our labo-

The use of omics technology (genomics, transcrip-
tomics, proteomics, metabolomics) in evolutionary and
ecological biology is increasing. This workshop will aim
to explore the diﬀerent levels of omics technology in
an ecological and evolutionary context with a focus on
methods and analysis of diﬀerent omics technology as
well as exploring how these diﬀerent technologies can
be integrated to form a systems view of evolutionary
biology.
In this Ph.D course and workshop we bring together re-
searchers with a primary focus on the use and integra-
tion of omics techniques in evolutionary and conserva-
tion biology. We have organised attendance from lead-
ing scientists in the ﬁeld that will give lectures on rel-
evant topics. The students will receive a compendium
with original research articles representing the latest re-
search within the topic. During the course time will be
set aside for group discussions on central themes based
on the articles, and also there will be time to discuss
your own projects. Students will be expected to ac-
tively participate in the workshop with a presentation
of either a talk or poster on your design or results in
order to obtain 5 ECTS.Additional information will be available on the Nord-

/www.mcisb.org/people/knight/ About evolutionary
systems biology
Evolutionary genetics has a long history of successful
quantitative modelling, especially in areas where func-
tional details can be abstracted by selection coeﬃcients.
Molecular biology has a long history of uncovering func-
tional details and has recently started to engage in
quantitative modelling at a larger scale, giving rise to
current systems biology. We propose to bring these
two ﬁelds together to help elucidate some fundamental
problems in evolutionary biology. Such a synthesis has
the potential to provide a mechanistic basis for in silico
predictions of many important parameters of evolution,
including distributions of mutational eﬀects, robustnessand epistasis. Central to this approach is the deﬁnition
of ﬁtness correlates that can be computed using mecha-
nistic models of individuals. One possible aim for mod-
elling in evolutionary systems biology could be to deﬁne
computable ﬁtness correlates that can be calibrated ex-
perimentally by measuring mutant properties.
This ambitious goal can inspire experimental and the-
oretical work at many levels of the adaptive landscape.
These levels include: 1. Changes in genotypes im-
pact predicted molecular structures (like protein struc-
tures). 2. Changes in molecular structures impact pre-
dicted molecular functions (like enzyme reaction rates).
3. Changes in molecular functions impact predicted
properties of reaction networks (see systems biology).
4. Changes in reaction network properties impact pre-
dicted ﬁtness correlates (need to be deﬁned for each
model). How ﬁtness correlates are mapped to ﬁtness
is deﬁned at even higher levels (see life-history evolu-
tion). All levels ultimately need to be brought together
to facilitate computational predictions of realistic mu-
tational eﬀects, robustness, epistasis and adaptive evo-
lution.
Here we aim to bring together researchers with an in-
terest in the adaptive landscape at any level and re-
searchers who want to contribute towards a synthesis
of evolutionary genetics with mechanistic models of life.
We believe that the new excitement in systems biology
is an excellent opportunity for progress in many funda-
mental evolutionary questions, if the new models that
are being constructed can be extended to include ﬁt-
ness correlates that turn them into powerful tools for
investigating

ArthropodSymbiosis Jun30-Jul3 2
In the frame of the COST Action FA0701 /lessmuchArthro-
pod Symbioses: from fundamental studies to pest and
disease management /greatermuchWe are pleased to announce
the workshop entitled: Evolution and Diversity of Sym-
bioses of Arthropods The workshop will be held from
the 30th of June to the 3rd of July 2010 in Bad
Bevensen, Germany.
Symbioses with bacteria and other microorganisms
have contributed greatly to the ecological and evolu-
tionary success of arthropods, either by providing es-
sential nutrients or digestive functions, or more un-
usual functions such as bioluminescence or contribut-
ing to healthcare of their hosts. Other endosymbionts
engage in more parasitic interactions with their hosts
by distorting their hosts sex ration to ensure their own
transmission. This stunning diversity of symbioses al-
ready became evident early in the 20th century, e.g. by
the wide range of associations included in Paul Buchn-
ers seminal book “Endosymbiose der Tiere emit Pﬂan-
zlichen Mikroorganismen” published in 1953.
Since then numerous symbiotic associations have been
characterized in great detail, with microbial partners
being identiﬁed, genomes of endosymbionts being se-
quenced and functions of the symbionts uncovered. The
use of culture independent techniques has led to agreat leap forward in uncovering the diversity present in
arthropod hosts as well as their speciﬁcity. Recent work
on a broad range of arthropod symbioses will be pre-
sented, with a wide range of microorganisms involved
that are located in a variety of organs such has antennal
glands, gut, malphigian tubules or reproductive tissue.
Whereas biologists recently became aware of the impor-
tance of mechanisms of hostsymbiont interactions and
the involvement of the immune system as an interface
between the two, we are only beginning to understand
how the crosstalk between diﬀerent endosymbionts can
alter the outcome of symbiotic associations when hosts
harbour endosymbiont consortia and how diverse some
of these consortia can be. In addition more and more
players in symbiotic interactions are uncovered as well
as new functions. Are such endosymbiont consortia sta-
ble in composition? Does competition among diﬀerent
endosymbionts for host resources harm the host as cer-
tain functions are provided in a lesser manner? How
easily can such endosymbiont consortia including gut
microﬂora be invaded by other microorganisms?
In this workshop, we welcome talks on diﬀerent kinds
of symbiotic interactions from mutualistic to para-
sitisic and comprising either single endosymbionts or
endosymbiont consortia. The very beginning of en-
dosymbiosis will be discussed. How are free living or-
ganisms incorporated into other organisms to become
endosymbionts?

Wellcome Trust Advanced Course Human Genome
Analysis: Genetic Analysis of Multifactorial Diseases
21-27 July 2010 Wellcome Trust Genome Campus,
Hinxton, Cambridge
NEW EXTENDED Deadline for applications: 23 April
2010
Course summary An intensive, residential, computer-
based course aimed at scientists actively involved in
genetic analysis of multifactorial traits.
Programme This advanced course covers statistical
methods currently used to map disease susceptibility
genes, with an emphasis on (but not limited to) meth-
ods that can analyse family data or a combination
of families and individuals. Discussions of the latest
statistical methodology are complemented by practical
hands-on computer exercises using state-of-the-art soft-ware. The statistical basics behind each method will
be carefully explained so that participants with a non-
statistical background can understand.
With a focus on family data, we will discuss funda-
mental issues needed to increase success in gene map-
ping studies including: optimal study design, power to
detect linkage and association, determining the most
appropriate statistical methods and software, interpre-
tation of statistical results and trouble shooting. We
will also cover the basic principles of statistical infer-
ence, hypothesis testing, population and quantitative
genetics and Mendelian inheritance.Our interactive and
intensive educational program will enable one to better
carry out sophisticated statistical analyses of genetic
data, and will also improve one’s interpretation and un-
derstanding of the results.All the software used is freely
available, so that skills learned can be easily applied af-
ter the course.
Teaching will take the form of lectures by invited speak-
ers, informal tutorials, hands-on computer sessions, and
analysis of disease family data sets. There will also be
an opportunity to discuss participants’ own data sets.

Applications
Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to remind you that applications for
WEBS 2010 are due April 15. WEBS (Women Evolving
Biological Sciences) is an annual three-day symposium
aimed at addressing the retention of female scientists
and issues related to the transition of women from early
career stages to tenure track positions and leadership
roles in academic and research settings. The inaugu-
ral WEBS symposia were huge successes. Early career
participants as well as our senior scientist panelists re-
ported feeling inspired and equipped with new connec-
tions and tools that they expect will help them in their
career in the years to come. We are now accepting ap-
plications online ( http://www.webs.washington.edu <
http://www.webs.washington.edu/ >) for participation
in the 2010 symposium.
WEBS will target early career women in the Biological
Sciences with an emphasis on ecology and evolutionary
biology. In particular, it will focus on women who have
earned their doctoral degrees within the past two to
eight years and who do not have tenure in order to ad-
dress the critical transition period from graduate stud-
ies and post-doctoral positions to permanent research
and teaching positions. The symposia will provide a fo-
rum for professional development, including awareness
and improvement of academic leadership skills; oppor-
tunities to establish mentoring relationships; and re-
sources for developing professional networks. The 2010
symposium will be held at the Pack Forest Conference
center near Seattle, WA from October 24-27, 2010.

Switzerland Speciation
SummerSchool Aug30-Sep3
Announcement: Summer school “Methods of Empirical
Speciation Research”
We are happy to announce an international PhD sum-
mer school on “Methods of Empirical Speciation Re-
search” that takes place from August 30 to September
3 2010 at the EAWAG Center of Ecology, Evolution &
Biogeochemistry in Switzerland.
The school is part of the European Science Founda-
tion Networking Programme Frontiers in Speciation
Research (FroSpects) and is open for PhD students and
exceptionally well qualiﬁed MSc students from all ESF
member countries. We have limited travel support and
free accommodation for 25 students, and consider ap-
plications from now to June 30th. The EAWAG Center
of Ecology, Evolution & Biogeochemistry is located in
Kastanienbaum, 10 kilometers from Lucerne town on
the shores of beautiful Alpine fjord Lake Lucerne.
Speciation research is currently one of the most pro-
ductive ﬁelds of science in evolutionary biology (So-
bel et al. 2009 Evolution). Its recent great success is
driven signiﬁcantly by advances in empirical speciation
research. A wave of advance came about in the 1990s
when molecular population genetics data became read-
ily available and researchers began to integrate these
with evolutionary ecology. We are now experiencing a
second wave of advance, ushered in by the genomics
era. However, studying speciation is a deeply inter-
disciplinary endeavour. Successful speciation research
requires good understanding of several diﬀerent ﬁelds
in ecology and evolution. This makes speciation re-
search sometimes more diﬃcult to access for young sci-
entists than more strictly disciplinary research ques-
tions in ecology and evolution. The school will intro-
duce advanced graduate students to the way successful
speciation researchers integrate concepts and methods
from various disciplines to t est hypotheses about mech-
anisms, modes and drivers of speciation.
Our summer school combines modular lecture series,
workshops and ﬁeld excursions to speciation research
sites in the Alps. Topics taught include major mech-
anisms of speciation, hybrid zones, hybrid specia-
tion, adaptive radiation, Fst outlier analysis, speciation
genes, natural and sexual selection and their interac-tion, studying mate choice, role of ﬂoral traits in spe-
ciation, inferring causality in speciation research. The
course emphasizes the integration of theoretical speci-
ation research with empirical methods from diﬀerent
disciplines. The target audience is PhD students and
exceptionally well qualiﬁed MSc students with back-
ground in evolutionary biology.
Distinguished Professors on the course are Roger But-
lin (U Sheﬃeld), Scott Hodges (UC Santa Barbara),
Catherine Peichel (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Centre), Glenn-Peter Saetre (CEES Oslo), and Sander
van Doorn (U Bern). The team of Swiss speciation
researchers that coordinate the school and contribute
to teaching include Elena Conti (U Z¨ urich), Martine
Maan (U Bern, Eawag), Walter Salzburger (U Basel),
Ole Seehausen (U Bern, Eawag), Arjun Sivasundar (U
Bern), Piet Spaak (Eawag) and Alex Widmer (ETHZ).
Prospective participants should send a letter of applica-
tion and a CV to Nadja Pepe at nadja.pepe@eawag.ch.
Applications will be accepted until June 30th. Later
applications can be considered if places are available.

Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Evolutionary Biology
(MEME)
MEME is a new two-year research oriented master pro-
gramme for talented and motivated students who are
interested in understanding evolution in all its facets.
The MEME programme will address the driving forces
of evolution at all levels of organismal organisation
(from cells and individuals to populations and ecosys-
tems), and it will allow students to study all kinds of or-
ganisms (microorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds
of habitats (marine as well as terrestrial) with a diver-
sity of approaches (ﬁeld, lab, theory). The focus of the
programme is not only on how evolution shaped life on
our planet in the past, but also on how understanding
the principles underlying evolution can provide new in-
sights and help to cope with present-day challenges in a
variety of ﬁelds, including ecology, epidemiology, phys-
iology, immunology, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics,
economics and the social sciences.
Only few universities in the world would be able to oﬀer
a programme of such broad scope without compromis-
ing scientiﬁc quality. For this reason, four European
universities: - University of Groningen (Netherlands) -
University of Montpellier II (France) - Ludwig Maximil-
ians University of Munich (Germany) - Uppsala Univer-
sity (Sweden) have joined forces with Harvard Univer-
sity (USA). Together, this consortium is able to put to-
gether an attractive multidisciplinary programme that
meets highest standards. All students have to study at
at least two partner universities, and they will receive
either a joint MSc degree from the whole consortium or
double degrees from two partner universities.
Being ﬁnanced by the European Community, MEME
has to satisfy the high quality standards imposed the
prestigious Erasmus Mundus Programme. Full schol-
arships are available for MEME students and will be
awarded in a selective procedure.
Starting date: September 2010
Application deadline: April 15, 2010 (European stu-dents, the deadline for non-European students has al-
ready passed)

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
