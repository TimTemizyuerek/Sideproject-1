Mar17-18
Dear colleagues and friends,
This is to announce the meeting that Jonathan Wendel,
Scot Jackson, Olivier Panaud, Michael Purugganan and
myself are organizing in Barcelona very soon, in March
(17-18), on plant genome evolution. The meeting is en-
titled \Evolution of plant phenotypes, from genomes to
traits" and will be divided in three scientic sessions: 1.
Mechanisms generating genome variability, with special
emphasis on polyploidy and TEs; 2. Evolution of plant
phenotypes: wild and domesticated species; 3. Domes-
tication and plant improvement: Putting science into
practice in the aid of the human condition. We have a
group of excellent speaker from the US, the EU, Israel
and Japan that will ensure a fantastic discussion on
these exciting and timely scientic questions.
The registration will be available very soon at
the price of only 100 euro (which includes the
lunch onsite for the two days of the conference).
Please visit the webpage of the meeting (http://-
plantevolutionbarcelona2015.cragenomica.es/) for more
information on the meeting.
Hope to see you in Barcelona!
Best wishes,
Josep

Bonn Systematics Mar18-21
The next Annual Meeting of the Gesellschaft f ur Bi-
ologische Systematik will take place on March 18-21,
2015, at the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander
Koenig (ZFMK) in Bonn.
It is now the third time the annual conference of the
GfBS (www.gfbs-home.de) takes place in Bonn at the
ZFMK, after the meetings in 1998 and 2012. With many
participants, these Annual Meetings are a complete suc-
cess and essential for the promotion of systematics and
taxonomy in Germany. The organizers hope for broad
interest of systematists in attending the 2015 meeting.After some large and expensive joint conferences of the
GfBS with other societies, the next annual meeting
will take place in a more \familiar" circle and at a low
conference fee.
As special items on the agenda, special workshops (on
Saturday 21. March) will oer for example software
training for \Mitogenom-Annotation" and \Target DNA
enrichment". For this, a separate registration is neces-
sary later on! In addition, participants will have the
chance to visit the Biohistoricum at ZFMK or take part
on a tour through the collection.
Registration of posters and talks is possible via the
email gfbs2015@zfmk.de New registration deadline is
January 30. 2015. More Information about the con-
ference: https://www.zfmk.de/gfbs2015 . All topics
of biological systematics are welcome! We especially
encourage submission of contributions about the topics
\The demand of taxonomic knowledge: for whom and in
what form?".
Key Speakers (status quo) - Florian Leese, Ruhr-UNI
Bochum, Improvement of freshwater ecosystem assess-
ment with DNA barcoding - Wolfgang Weisser, TU
M unchen, Ecology and Taxonomy - start of a new
partnership - Hans-Joachim Mader, Stiftung Naturland-
schaften Brandenburg, monitoring in natural landscapes
- Peter Zulka, Umweltbundesamt Wien/ Rote Liste, taxo-

Cairns Behaviour
FemaleSongFitnessCosts Aug9-14
Dear evoldir members,
As a part of the Behaviour 2015 conference that will be
held in Cairns, Australia, on 9-14 August 2015 (http:/-
/www.behaviour2015.org/), we are pleased to announce
a symposium on the topic \Female song: tness costs
and benets".
Symposium summary:
Bird song, traditionally regarded as primarily a male
trait, is in fact widespread among female songbirds and
was likely present in the ancestor of modern songbirds.
These recent ndings challenge the view that sexual
dimorphism in the expression and complexity of song islargely the outcome of sexual selection on males. It is
now clear that understanding the evolution of bird song
requires explaining variation within and among species
in the expression and complexity of female song. To
do this, we need a better understanding of the nature
of variation in female song in dierent contexts and
systems, as well as the tness costs and benets of vari-
ation in the expression and complexity of female song.
The aim of this symposium is to draw together current
research on female song with the goal of understanding
the tness costs and benets of the diversity of female
singing behaviour apparent among songbirds.
Abstract submissions for oral presentations can be sub-
mitted until 15 March 2015:
http://www.behaviour2015.org/symposium-details/

Naomi E Langmore - naomi.langmoreATanu.edu.au
The conference is a major international meeting and
a great opportunity to meet and interact with other
scientists in the eld, as it will be a joint meeting
of the International Ethological Conference (IEC <
http://www.ethologycouncil.org/ >), Australasian So-
ciety for the Study of Animal Behaviour (ASSAB <

| SCOPE New genomic technologies are bringing previ-
ously intractable but fascinating aspects of forest tree
biology to the forefront of plant biology. Completed
and ongoing sequencing projects are providing extensive
expressed gene and even full genome sequence resources
for tree species from diverse taxa. At the same time,
creative applications of genomic and sequencing tech-
nologies are producing tools capable of probing the
fundamental processes responsible for woody growth
and other unique biological processes in trees. Among
the most promising but largely unexplored areas of re-
search is the use of comparative evolutionary genomics
approaches that can illuminate key regulatory processes
and how they have evolved over macro- and micro-
evolutionary history. For example, the evolutionary
innovations leading to the vast array of woody growth
forms in extant plants are almost entirely unknown at
the genetic level, but could soon be elucidated using
comparative genomics approaches.
We will bring together researchers who are exploring the
frontiers of tree evolution, ecology, and development us-
ing next generation sequencing, genomics, and systems
biology approaches. Together, we hope to inspire new
ideas for collaborative research that will bring together
currently disjoint research communities, and usher in
a new era of genome-based forest biology. Ultimately,8 EvolDir February 1, 2015
the approaches and insights from genome-based forest
biology will inform us how to address problems rang-
ing from forest conservation during climate change to
tailoring of tree-based biofuels feedstocks.
| FORMAT The symposium will take place over two
days at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University,
Boston, MA, USA. There will be dedicated time for
discussions, posters, selected poster talks, a conference
dinner and a tour of the Arboretum's collections.

MidwestEcologyEvolution Mar28-29
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that this year (March 28-29,
2015) The Midwest Ecology and Evolution Conference
(MEEC) will be held at Indiana University Blooming-
ton!
MEEC is an annual student-hosted research confer-
ence held at various institutions within the Midwestern
United States. The conference provides an outstanding
opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students
to showcase their research and network with students
and faculty from nearby institutions. MEEC provides a
great environment for emerging scientists to discuss new
ideas, hone presentation skills, and make connections in
the local science community.
MEEC will include oral and poster sessions, panel ses-
sions on outreach and career development, as well as
what promise to be extraordinary plenary talks by Dr.
Cathy Pster (University of Chicago) and Dr. Alan
Templeton (Washington University in St. Louis). The
abstract call and registration are both from February
1-28. Registration for MEEC is only $50!
Moreover, the annual IU Animal Behavior Conference
(ABC), hosted by the IU Center for the Integrative
Study of Animal Behavior, will take place right before
MEEC, from March 26-28. We encourage people with a
research interest in behavior to attend both conferences
(plus, registration for ABC is free).
Get excited for one of the most enjoyable confer-
ences of the year! You can nd more informa-
tion about the conference and how to register at
our website (http://meec2015.wordpress.com), Face-
book (https://www.facebook.com/MEEC.conference),
or Twitter (@MidEcoEvoCon).

Krakow EvolutionaryConservation-
Monoamines
Aug23-28
We are organizing a symposium titled 'The role of
monoamines in modulating behavior' at the Ninth In-
ternational Conference of Comparative Physiology and
Biochemistry, to take place in Krakow, Poland from
August 23-28, 2015. The description of the symposium
is pasted below, at the end of this message.
The conference registration opens on January 25, and
we would like to be able to include a list of conrmed
speakers by that date. At this time, the conference fees
have not been announced. There may be fee waivers
available to invited speakers on a limited basis, but there
are no funds available to cover travel expenses. More
information about the conference can be found at http:/-
/www.iccpb2015.confer.uj.edu.pl/. Please respond with
a tentative title and abstract by January 21 to ensure
your inclusion as an invited speaker in both the general
announcement for the conference, and in our symposium.
Later replies may still be considered for inclusion in the
symposium as regular (non-invited) attendees. Replies
should be sent to jaime.grace@ucdenver.edu
Best wishes, John Swallow Jaime Grace Andrew Bubak
Organizing committee
Symposium: The role of monoamines in modulating
behavior
Monoamines, such as serotonin, dopamine, and nora-
drenaline, have a variety of essential physiological roles
in modulating animal behavior. Furthermore, the evo-
lutionary conservation of these aminergic systems spans
across both vertebrates and invertebrates, having com-
parable eects in such diverse processes as learning and
memory, aggression, mating behaviors and reproduction,
stress responses, and locomotion. Outstanding research
is currently being conducted in this eld, uncovering
remarkable similarities in neural circuitries even among
highly divergent taxa, such as Drosophila and humans.
Investigating the neural mechanisms involved in the
monoaminergic modulation of behavior across a variety
of taxonomically distant species can provide researchers
with a better understanding of the origins and functions
of these systems. The goal of this symposium is to
provide a venue in which colleagues, researching inverte-
brates and vertebrates, both model and nonmodel, canpresent their recent and groundbreaking work in this
exciting area of biology. We hope this symposium will
encourage and stimulate a dialogue on the similarities
of monoaminergic function in a wide variety of animals
and ultimately promote future comparative approaches
when investigating behavioral modulation.

ESEB 2015 SYMPOSIUM ON SPECIATION GE-

Dear colleagues,
This is a nal reminder of the abstract deadline (10th
January) for our symposium CHARTING THE GE-
NOMIC LANDSCAPE OF SPECIATION which will be
held at the 15th Congress of the European Society for
Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) in Lausanne, Switzerland,
10th - 14th August 2015.
INVITED SPEAKERS - Nicolas Bierne (Institut de Sci-
ences de l'Evolution- Montpellier, France) - Mohamed10 EvolDir February 1, 2015
Noor (Duke University, USA)
ORGANIZERS - Anja Westram (Sheeld, UK) - Mark
Ravinet (NIG, Japan) - Juan Galindo (Vigo, Spain) -
Rui Faria (Porto, Portugal)
NB: Although only two organisers are ocially listed,
the idea for the symposium was conceived by a group of
four people who are all contributing to its organisation.
WEBSITE (Symposium No. 34) http://www3.unil.ch/-
wpmu/eseb2015/symposium list/ DESCRIPTION:
Understanding how speciation with gene ow works at
the genomic level is currently a major focus of speciation
biology. Genome scans between diverging populations
have become widespread, demonstrating that the extent
of dierentiation can be quite variable across the genome.
Highly dierentiated regions are often interpreted as re-
sulting from divergent selection, therefore playing an
important role in speciation. This view is prominently
expressed in the striking metaphor of ^ aspeciation is-
lands'. Yet some debate remains. Is dierentiation
generated by divergent natural selection acting as a
barrier to otherwise homogenising gene ow? Or by
recombination rate variation and/or intrinsic incompat-
ibilities? Might dierentiation occur when gene ow
ceases and local adaptation increases the rate of lineage
sorting in some parts of the genome but not others?
And what genomic features aect homogenising gene
ow? Being able to distinguish these alternative expla-
nations is fundamental for understanding the genomic
basis of speciation with gene ow. This symposium will
explore this debate, bringing together empirical evidence
from dierent perspectives and focusing on emerging
approaches for identifying the processes that cause the
rugged landscape of genomic dierentiation.
DETAILS:
Registration for ESEB 2015 and abstract submis-
sion for all symposiums is now available at: http://-
www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/ . Please be aware the
deadline for submitting abstracts for both talk and

10 March 2015 at The Royal Society, London
https://royalsociety.org/events/2015/03/nervous-
system/ Scientic discussion meeting organised by
Professor Nicholas Strausfeld FRS and Dr Frank Hirth
Event details The origin of brains and central nervous
systems is thought to have occurred before the Paleo-
zoic era. Yet in the absence of tangible evidence there
has been continued debate whether today's brains de-
rive from one ancestral origin or whether similarities
amongst them are due to convergent evolution. This
meeting will consider the origin of nervous systems, in-
tegrating knowledge ranging from evolutionary theory
and palaeontology to comparative developmental ge-
netics and phylogenomics. It will cover discoveries of
fossil brains, as well as correspondences of neural circuit
organisation and behaviours, all of which allow evidence-
based debates for and against the proposition that the
nervous systems and brains of animals all derive from a
common ancestor.
Attending this event This event is intended for re-
searchers in relevant elds and is free to attend. There
are a limited number of places and registration is essen-
tial. An optional lunch is oered and should be booked
during registration (all major credit cards accepted).
This meeting is immediately followed by a related, two-
day satellite meeting, "Homology and convergence in
nervous system evolution\ (https://royalsociety.org/-
events/2015/03/nervous-system-satellite/), at the Royal
Society at Chicheley Hall, home of the Kavli Royal
Society International Centre.

* Symposium description: Post-transcriptional modi-
cations of mRNAs by alternative splicing (AS) are
thought to be an important road for evolutionary in-
novation. The advent of RNA-seq has enabled deep
surveys of the splicing complexity across species. How-
ever, there are still large gaps in our understanding
of the signicance of AS evolution. This symposium
aims at moving beyond simple comparisons of AS events
across species to the study of the functional impact of
new isoforms during evolution. We will highlight the
latest advances in the eld, notably related to the fol-
lowing questions: - How did splicing evolve between
species? What use can be made of the last sequencing
technologies (e.g., long-reads) to describe the evolution
of AS at an unprecedented resolution? - Recent studies
have highlighted that many isoforms are low-abundance
and species-specic. What portion of AS might just
represent \noise"? How could it inuence the evolution
of transcriptomes? - What is the functional impact of
AS on the evolution of proteins? E.g., does AS modu-
late protein-protein interaction networks? What are the
changes induced by AS on protein structures?
* SMBE website and registration: http://smbe2015.at/

SMBE SYMPOSIUM ON DETECTING SELECTION
USING ANCIENT GENOMES - VIENNA JULY 12-
16TH 2015.
We are pleased to invite you to participate in the sym-
posium \Ancient genomes: A time machine for investi-
gating natural selection", which will take place at the
annual meeting of the Society for Molecular Biology and
Evolution (Vienna, July 12-16th 2015).
Symposium abstract: 'Detecting natural selection and
processes underlying genetic adaptations are core ob-
jectives of evolutionary biology and ecology. A number
of statistical approaches have been developed in recent
years to detect signatures of natural selection in modern
genetic data. However, they all have poor temporal
resolution, most are confounded by past demographic
processes, and many are insensitive to selection acting
on standing variation.
Ancient genomics has gained considerable momentum
in recent years but its application to selection studies
is still in its infancy. Sequencing ancient genomes from
fossil material provides a unique snapshot of past genetic
variation, thus providing a powerful tool for investigat-
ing adaptation hypotheses directly, and the only means
of assessing temporal heterogeneity in natural selection.
In this Symposium we will explore new methods and the
potentials of using heterochronic data to study natural
selection, whether comparing ancient genomes to mod-
ern variation and/or ancient genomes from dierent time
periods. We will discuss the principles, examples and
potential limitations of detecting selection in any organ-
ism for which ancient genomes are available, including
prokaryotes, plants, animals, and humans.'

Symposium description:
Since their discovery nearly 40 years ago, the Archaea
have not stopped being one of the major challenges of
Evolutionary Biology. From a cell biology and genomic
point of view they represent chimeras of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic features, which places them in a key position
in the Tree of Life. They thrive in a wide variety of con-
trasted environments, from deep oceans to the human
gut, and have occupied key roles in the setup of major
biogeochemical cycles of the early Earth. The devel-
opment of culture-independent genomics techniques is
providing access to an ever-larger and so far inaccessible
fraction of archaeal diversity. This leads to a number of
exciting discoveries that are revolutionizing our vision of
archaeal evolution, generating novel challenges to dissect
the nature of the last common archaeal ancestor and the
evolutionary trajectories that shaped this domain of life.
The archaeal tree is being rapidly lled up with new
branches constituting entire phyla and orders with novelFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 19
characteristics. Genomic data has highlighted the exis-
tence of additional eukaryotic-like characters previously
unsuspected in the archaea and re-launched the issue of
their role in eukaryogenesis. A symposium specically
focused the diversity and evolution of the Archaea will
be a timely occasion to present these exciting new data
for this major prokaryotic domain, still widely unknown
by the large audience.

Dear all,

transposable elements. Vera Gorbunova (University of

ORGANIZERS: Josefa Gonz alez. Institute of Evolution-
ary Biology. Barcelona. Ellen Pritham. Department of
Human Genetics. The University of Utah.
SUMMARY: Transposable elements are a diverse set
of genetic elements able to integrate and often prop-
agate within and between genomes. They engender
genome variation and novelty directly from integration
and incidentally over a longer evolutionary timeframe
by providing platforms for recombination and via the
exaptation of sequences that they carry. Transposable
elements are found in nearly all organisms and often ac-
count for the bulk of genetic material. As with so manyareas of genetics, the advent of genomic technologies has
revolutionized the study of transposable elements, the
mutation spectrum and their biological impact. This has
led to an avalanche of important discoveries revealing
new mechanisms through which transposable elements
have shaped the chromosomal and regulatory architec-
ture of genomes. This symposium will showcase the
impressive array of mechanisms by which the evolution-
ary trajectory of the host is inuenced by transposable
elements. By focusing on the biological impact of trans-
posable elements, we aim to showcase the diversity of
ways that eukaryotic genomes have been shaped there-
fore appealing to researchers beyond the transposable
element community.

DemographyAndSelection Jul12-16
Dear Colleagues,
We are please to invite you to our symposium on \Re-
framing the demography vs. selection debate using 21st
century models and data," which will be held at the
Annual Meeting of the Society for Molecular Biology
and Evolution (SMBE) in Vienna on July 12-16, 2015.
The deadline for submission of abstracts is February
8th, 2015.
Symposium summary:
The importance of natural selection versus population
history at shaping genetic variation is at the core of
population genetics and has been debated for decades.
However, there is a deep interplay between these two
evolutionary forces. For example, recent studies have
determined that demographic processes have shaped pat-
terns of segregating deleterious variation in humans and
that ancient admixture has provided new adaptive alle-
les on which selection has acted. Further, it is becoming
increasingly clear that natural selection can confound
demographic inference from genomic data. Due to the
wealth of DNA sequence data from multiple model and
non-model taxa, ancient and modern genomes, it is now20 EvolDir February 1, 2015
possible to study the interplay between selection and
demography at a higher resolution than was previously
feasible. However, even with more data, these topics are
not without controversy.^ aThis symposium will feature
theoretical and empirical advances in studying the inter-
play between demography and selection using genomic
data. It will include a timely discussion of complex pop-
ulation genetic models that simultaneously model both
processes. This symposium will be of interest to a broad
audience because it will provide fresh perspectives on a
classic and highly relevant topic in population genetics.

Symposium description:
The study of microbial community ecology and evolu-
tion has been advancing at a rapid pace for a few years,
beneting from the possibility to analyze metagenomic
sequence data. Microbial communities in diverse envi-
ronments have been characterized, with major impact on
our understanding of microecology and human health.
However, the complex nature of a microbial commu-
nity makes it challenging to identify the ecological and
evolutionary processes driving its multi-level structure.
A community comprises dozens to hundreds of species
interacting together, sharing or competing for goods, co-
operating for or antagonizing in niche occupation. It can
also be seen as a loosely compartmentalized gene pool
structured by the pattern of genetic exchange among
its members. These species and genetic interactions
evolve in time along with the surrounding environment.
Revealing the evolutionary processes linking these as-
pects of microbiomes is critical to understanding how
microbes adapt to various environments and, in turn,
how environments are impacted. This symposium aims
at presenting new empirical results on evolution and
ecology of microbial communities and the dynamics
of their taxonomic composition, genomic diversity and
functional repertoires. Methodological advances allow-
ing us to infer these dynamics will also be presented.

SMBE 2015 Symposium on Evolution of Multicellularity,
July 12-16, Vienna
Dear evoldir colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the symposium entitled
\The origins of multicellularity under the light of func-
tional genomics, as part of the annual SMBE meet-
ing that will be held in Vienna on July 12-16 2015
(http://smbe2015.univie.ac.at/home/). We encourage
you to submit your abstracts for oral presentations
before February 8th (http://smbe2015.univie.ac.at/-
registration/).
Symposium summary: The origin of multicellularity is
one of the major evolutionary transitions in the history
of life. But unicellular to multicellular transitions have
occurred independently several times during eukaryote
evolution. In the last decade, the sequencing of the
genomes of multicellular species and their closest uni-
cellular relatives allowed for the rst time to investigate
the molecular basis of the multicellular transitions by
using comparative genomics. Nowadays, the rapid ad-
vance of functional genomics and the development of key
species as model systems are pushing the question into
a new level, going beyond genome content description.
This oers a unique opportunity to functionally test hy-
potheses about the origin of multicellularity regarding22 EvolDir February 1, 2015
genome regulation, gene function and the fundamentals
of embryonic development. In this symposium we will
cover these new approaches to the question of the multi-
cellular transition from a multidisciplinary perspective,
including recent advances from several elds (transcrip-
tomics, cell biology, epigenomics) in dierent eukaryotic
lineages.

We would like to encourage you to apply for our up-
coming symposium \*Cancer as a Darwinian process*,"
which will be held at the July 2015 meeting of the Soci-
ety for Molecular Biology and Evolution (*SMBE 2015*)
in Vienna [*http://smbe2015.at/*] . The symposium
will focus on the evolutionary dynamics that govern the
process of tumor initiation and progression.
*Symposium description:*
Cancer, one of the worlds biggest killers, is fundamen-
tally a Darwinian process. Heritable genetic and epi-
genetic changes can disrupt the systems regulating cell
replication, which can, in turn, break down the mecha-
nisms of cooperation between cells that are fundamental
to multicellularity. In this sense, tumors are nothing
more than populations of cells with an evolutionary ad-
vantage. In order to understand and eradicate cancer,
we must rst understand the evolutionary dynamics
that govern the process of tumor initiation and progres-
sion. This understanding requires an evolutionary and
ecological perspective that can integrate vast amounts
of biological and clinical data as well as an evolutionaryframework that makes testable predictions as to how
interventions will inuence therapeutic outcomes. This
symposium will bring together researchers with dierent
perspectives - cancer researchers, mathematical oncol-
ogists, and evolutionary biologists and ecologists - to
explore how mathematical approaches can be used to
understand tumor initiation and progression as well as
how evolutionarily informed approaches can be used
to gain new insights in cancer research. The work pre-
sented will provide a basis for future research into cancer
as an evolutionary process.
Conrmed invited speaker is Dr. Natalia Komarova.
The abstract submission deadline is February 8, 2015.
We hope to see you this summer!

Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to announce a symposium on \Inferring
tness landscapes from experimental evolution", which
will be held as part of the Society for Molecular Biology
and Evolution (SMBE) meeting, July 12-16 in Vienna,
Austria. Applications to give a talk as part of this sym-
posium will be accepted through February 8; for details
concerning how to submit an abstract see the conference
website (http://smbe2015.at/).
Symposium Description:
What can we learn about the structure of a tness
landscape from observations in evolving laboratory pop-
ulations? Despite the potential power of massively repli-
cated laboratory evolution experiments, we remain ig-
norant about the large-scale structure of tness land-
scapes, even in simple, xed environments. The central
diculty is that we do not know how best to draw in-
ferences from the data generated in such experiments.
To make matters worse, we do not even know what
types of inferences can be made, in principle, from
which types of data that is, which feature of the tness
landscape, such as epistasis, are identiable. This sym-
posium will showcase recent eorts to provide a rm
statistical and population-genetic grounding for drawingFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 23
inferences about the forces shaping adaptation using
data from replicate experimental populations.
Olivier Tenaillon and Michael Desai are conrmed as

Dear Colleagues, We are writing to invite you to submit
abstracts to our symposium on *novel functional ap-
proaches to evolutionary genomics*, which will be held
as part of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolu-
tion (SMBE) meeting, July 12-16 in Vienna, Austria.

Greg Wray - http://sites.biology.duke.edu/wraylab/
*Symposium description Formal testing of many
evolutionary hypotheses, especially in closely related
mammals, has been dicult until now due to practical
and ethical constraints. However, recent advances in
cellular biology, such as the development of induced
pluripotent stem cell and genome editing technologies
and genomics, like single cell sequencing, can open the
door to powerful new ways of studying evolution. These
technologies are bringing together multiple groups with
diverse interests and perspectives, and transforming
studies of functional evolution that were previously
intractable in non-model organisms like the great apes.
Our symposium will highlight research that incorporates
these novel approaches to enrich our understanding of
evolutionary function and process, such as mechanisms
of gene regulation or the importance of developmental
contributions to phenotypic divergence.

be sent by February 8, 2015. Abstracts for poster pre-
sentations should be sent by March 29, 2015. Travel
awards and childcare support are available. http:/-

Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to invite you to submit abstracts for
a SMBE2015 symposium, \Fungal Evolutionary Ge-
nomics: Unravelling Mysteries from the Forgotten King-
dom." The symposium will occur at the annual meeting

Evolutionary Genomics: Unravelling Mysteries from the
Forgotten Kingdom
Fungi have small and compact genomes, yet they retain
the key features of other eukaryotes, including introns,
centromeres, telomeres, sexual cycles, and complex reg-
ulatory networks. They arose in the Precambrian and
have radiated to perform a wide array of heterotrophic
ecosystem functions, such as the parasitism of animals
and plants, tissue decay, and sugar fermentation. Fungi
have evolved remarkably dierent carbon utilization
strategies, allowing dierent species to store excess nu-
trients and energy as riboavin, oils, ethanol, and even
octane. Thus, they are superlative models of metabolic
and genome evolution across even deep evolutionary
timescales. Fungal genomes have provided fundamen-
tal insights into how functions are partitioned among
paralogs following whole genome duplications, how life
cycles evolve, and how ecological shifts lead to changes
in genome content and metabolism. Several large-scale
evolutionary genomics projects, including the Dikaryome
(iG enol evures Consortium), F1000 Fungal Genomes,
and Y1000+ Saccharomycotina Yeasts projects, make
this a timely symposium, which promises to illuminate
general principals of genome evolution while providing
tractable model systems that enable rigorous experimen-
tal tests.

Jul12-16
Dear evoldir members,
As a part of the Annual Meeting of the Society for
Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE), that will be
held in Vienna on July 12-16 2015, we are pleased to
announce a symposium on the topic \Adaptive and non-
adaptive evolution of gene expression and regulation".
Abstract submissions for oral presentations are open
until February 8th.
Symposium summary:
Identifying the substrate of adaptive evolution is a key
question in evolutionary biology. It was proposed early
on that much of adaptive evolution may occur at the
level of gene expression, by means of positive selection
acting on the genetic variation naturally occurring at
regulatory elements. Comparisons of gene expression
patterns and regulatory mechanisms are now possible
within and between species, allowing evolutionary biolo-
gists to reveal the genetic mechanisms of adaptations.
However, non-adaptive forces are also expected to shape
the genetic variation of regulatory modules and to drive
the evolution of gene expression. Therefore, mechanisms
such as genetic drift, biased gene conversion, variability
in mutation rates have to be carefully taken into accountwhen reconstructing the evolutionary history of gene ex-
pression and regulation. In this symposium we propose
to bring together researchers from the elds of popula-
tion genetics, functional and evolutionary genomics and
systems biology to discuss issues related to the func-
tional characterization of the genetic variation within
regulatory elements and the statistical inference of evo-
lutionary forces driving the evolution of gene expression.
We encourage submissions that examine adaptive and
non-adaptive mechanisms underlying dierent aspects of
gene expression evolution, including alternative splicing,
non-coding RNA expression, as well as transcriptional
and post-transcriptional regulation.
Invited speakers: Prof. Laurent Duret (http://-
lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/-Duret-Laurent-.html?lang=en) and

SMBE 2015 Symposium on the Consequences of Gene
Flow, July 12-16, Vienna
Dear Colleagues,
I'm writing to let you know about a symposium we
are organizing at this year's SMBE in Vienna on the
Functional Consequences of Gene Flow. Here's the info:
Title: Exploring the consequences of ancient and con-
temporary gene ow
Description: One reason why species are notoriously
hard to dene is that gene ow often continues in the
face of emerging reproductive barriers. Genomic dataFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 25
has revealed that introgression is ubiquitous; in particu-
lar, ancient DNA sequencing has uncovered evidence of
ancient gene ow from archaic hominins into anatomi-
cally modern humans. The distribution of introgressed
alleles in modern human genomes suggests that selection
has acted both to eliminate deleterious foreign material
and to retain locally adaptive archaic variation related to
phenotypes including keratin lament structure, adapta-
tion to high altitude, and lipid metabolism. In addition,
contemporary introgression has aected the evolutionary
trajectories of many plants and animals, particularly as
anthropogenic environmental alteration spurs changes
in species' geographic ranges including colonization of
new habitats and alteration of life history traits such as
migration timing. Gene ow can be adaptive and even
rescue populations threatened by inbreeding depression,
but always at the risk of inducing outbreeding depression
or displacing endemic genetic variation. This sympo-
sium will bring together recent work on archaic hominin
admixture with studies of gene ow in other species,
focusing on the tness consequences of introgression
over long and short timescales.

Untangling information, noise, and phylogenetic recon-
struction in genome scale data: A Symposium in SMBE
2015 at Vienna.
Abstracts for oral presentations are being sought for a
phylogenetics symposium titled \Untangling informa-
tion, noise, and phylogenetic reconstruction in genome
scale data", a part of SMBE 2015 (July 12-16) at Vi-
enna, Austria. Abstracts are due Feb 8, 2015 at SMBE2015 abstract submission website.
A brief summary of the theme of the symposium:
Phylogenetic information and noise are central com-
ponents in successful tree reconstruction as they can
invariably impact tree resolution, support, and accuracy.
As we attempt to resolve deeper, shorter internodes
and estimate short branch lengths in the tree of life
with genome-scale data sets, the magnitude of impact
of these two components is accentuated considerably, as
is the prevalence of conicts among gene trees. These
phylogenetic issues are greatly entangled with intrinsic
gene features, e.g. gene mode and tempo of evolution,
and are exacerbated by historic depth. A high rate
of nucleotide substitution can obscure phylogenetic in-
formation, and sometimes yields noise at deep historic
times. However, fast rates and genome-scale datasets
also potentially yield much more information if modeled
accurately, taxa are suciently sampled, and substi-
tution rate is not so fast. Thus, our symposium will
be relevant to molecular evolution, phylogenetics and
genomics. Recruited speakers will address theoretical
and empirical studies relating to:
1) assessment of suitability of genomic regions across a
spectrum of nucleotide substitution rates and selection
pressure to resolve phylogenetic trees;
2) comparison between whole genome vs. 'optimal genes'
approaches;
3) evaluation of the eectiveness of current ap-
proaches/algorithms used in discerning sources of signal,
noise and conicts among phylogenetic trees;
4) fast methods and algorithms for dating and phyloge-
netic reconstruction of large genomic data.

Symposium description:
Since their discovery nearly 40 years ago, the Archaea
have not stopped being one of the major challenges of
Evolutionary Biology. From a cell biology and genomic
point of view they represent chimeras of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic features, which places them in a key position
in the Tree of Life. They thrive in a wide variety of con-
trasted environments, from deep oceans to the human
gut, and have occupied key roles in the setup of major
biogeochemical cycles of the early Earth. The devel-
opment of culture-independent genomics techniques is
providing access to an ever-larger and so far inaccessible
fraction of archaeal diversity. This leads to a number of
exciting discoveries that are revolutionizing our vision of
archaeal evolution, generating novel challenges to dissect
the nature of the last common archaeal ancestor and theevolutionary trajectories that shaped this domain of life.
The archaeal tree is being rapidly lled up with new
branches constituting entire phyla and orders with novel
characteristics. Genomic data has highlighted the exis-
tence of additional eukaryotic-like characters previously
unsuspected in the archaea and re-launched the issue of
their role in eukaryogenesis. A symposium specically
focused the diversity and evolution of the Archaea will
be a timely occasion to present these exciting new data
for this major prokaryotic domain, still widely unknown
by the large audience.

SMBE SYMPOSIUM ON MICRO-EVO-DEVO - VI-
ENNA JULY 12-16TH 2015.
Title: ^ aMicro-evo-devo: using natural variation to ex-
plain the how and why of phenotypic evolution'
Invited Speaker: Marie Anne-Felix (Institute of Biology
of the Ecole Normale Sup erieure, Paris)
Dear colleagues,
we would like to welcome you to submit your abstract
to our symposium on Micro- Evo- Devo.
Micro-evo-devo synthesises population genetics and evo-
lutionary developmental biology to take advantage of
natural variation to explain the genetic and develop-
mental bases, and tness consequence of phenotypic
change, as well as the evolutionary forces that have
shaped it. Therefore, this symposium will highlight how
the integrative framework of micro-evo-devo has great
potential to explain how and why phenotypic diversity
among populations has evolved. This symposium will
provide a platform for the most recent advances using
established models and attract researchers using recent
advances in sequencing and genome editing technologies
to investigate phenotypic evolution in emerging models.
We expect that our proposed symposium will serve to
consolidate this growing community and help the eld

http://smbe2015.univie.ac.at/registration/ Symposium
description: Generally, the eld of molecular evolution
is dominated by studies of descent with accumulation
of slight modications. However, larger changes are
also possible, in which entirely new molecular features
originate for the rst time.
We will consider rapid or spontaneous molecular innova-
tions of diverse kinds (structures, functions, interactions,
networks), with a preference for the most dramatic leaps
between the absence and the presence of the molecular
traits or features in question.
Timely examples of great interest in the community
include (i) de novo emergence of new genes, protein do-
mains, regulatory regions and (ii) neo-functionalization,
e.g. via the acquisition of new and adaptive binding
activities.
The symposium will not only address well-documented
examples of spontaneous emergence of novel molecular
traits, but also cover ndings relevant to the processes
of innovation and its aftermath. These include (but are
not limited to) the roles of promiscuity (e.g. in the emer-
gence of novel enzymatic functions) and stochasticity
across dierent organization levels.
We look forward to seeing you in Vienna!

SMBE 2015 Symposium on Evolution of Molecular Path-
ways and Networks, July 12-16, Vienna
We are pleased to invite you to participate in the sym-
posium \Evolution of molecular pathways and networks:
Molecular evolution meets systems biology", which will
take place at the annual meeting of the Society for
Molecular Biology and Evolution (Vienna, July 12-16,
2015; http://smbe2015.at/).
Symposium summary: Proteins rarely work in isolation.
On the contrary, they often operate as pieces of com-
plex systems, including cells and organisms. As such,
their function is mediated, and/or regulated, through
interactions with other proteins. The complexity of inter-
molecular interactions within a cell can be represented in
the form of various networks (including protein\protein
interaction networks, metabolic networks, signaling net-
works, genetic networks, and transcriptional regulatory
networks). In the last years, draft versions of such large-
scale maps have started to become available, allowing a
systems-level exploration of the cell. Understanding how
proteins operate and evolve as a system is not only an
exciting endeavor, but also one that can aid applications
such as drug discovery and metabolic engineering. From
the point of view of molecular evolution, understanding
proteins' patterns of evolution may benet from con-
sidering their position in the networks of which they
are part. For instance, it is known that proteins acting
at the center of molecular networks (i.e., those that
interact with many other proteins) are more selectively
constrained (and thus more evolutionarily conserved)
than those acting at the periphery. In this symposium
we will explore how networks of interacting proteins
have generated (grown) over evolutionary time, how a
network approach can help understand gene's patterns
of evolution, and, in general, how networks evolve at
the systems level.

Vienna SMBE RapidAdaptation
Jul12-16
Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to announce our symposium on \Popula-
tion genomics of rapid adaptation", which will be held
as part of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evo-
lution (SMBE) meeting, July 12-16 in Vienna, Austria.
Applications to give a talk as part of this symposium
will be accepted through February 8; for details con-
cerning how to submit an abstract, see the conference
website (http://smbe2015.at/).
Symposium description:
One of the most puzzling observations in evolutionary
biology is that organisms can often adapt surprisingly
quickly to environmental challenges. Classical examples
of such rapid adaptations include the domestication of
plants and animals and the evolution of pesticide or
drug resistance. It is now becoming increasingly clear
that the potential for rapid adaptation is a ubiquitous
feature of evolution across a wide spectrum of systems,
ranging from experimental evolution in microbes, to the
progression of cancer cells in the human body, to the
rapid responses of species under climate change. The
growing number of systems where rapid adaptations
are directly observable presents us with the fascinat-
ing opportunity to study evolution in real time and to
make progress in understanding what limits the rate
of evolution and determines its likely outcome. In this
symposium, we will focus on (i) novel approaches to
detect and study rapid adaptation using population
genomic data, (ii) case studies of rapid adaptation in
natural populations, and (iii) experimental studies of
rapid adaptation in model systems. Although rapid
adaptation has long been associated primarily with theFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 31
evolution of polygenic traits that can adapt quickly by
using standing genetic variation, we will also highlight
recent work showing that adaptation at times can be
rapid despite relying on de novo mutations.

SMBE SYMPOSIUM ON SPATIAL POPULATION
GENETICS - VIENNA
JULY 12-16TH 2015
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to invite you to submit abstracts for a
symposium at the SMBE 2015 meeting entitled: 'Pop-
Gen in space! Theory and inference in spatial population
genetics.'
Spatial processes are a key component of evolution as
they play a crucial role in determining patterns of ge-
netic variation within a species. The importance of
spatial processes has been clear since the earliest days
of evolutionary genetics and has continued to be an area
of intense interest because of the potential to shed light
on the history of populations, the nature of adaptive
evolution, and speciation. Recently there have been
multiple advances in theoretical models and statistical
methodology that are transforming our ability to study
spatial population genomics, and large datasets are mak-
ing many new analyses possible. The purpose of our
symposium is to provide a forum for a presentation of re-
cent advances, as well as future challenges and prospects
for spatial population genetics. Our conrmed headline
speakers are Laurent Excoer (Bern) and Nick Barton
(IST Austria).
We encourage abstract submissions from any researchers
in this area, particularly students and postdocs, and we
aim to present an excellent set of talks from a diverse
background of speakers. *The DEADLINE for abstract
submission is: February 8, 2015. * Check submission
details on SMBE's annual meeting webpage http://-

Vienna SMBE SpeciationGenomics
Jul12-16
SMBE Speciation genomics - Vienna, July 12-16th 2015
Dear colleagues
We would like to invite you to join a symposium on Spe-
ciation genomics at the next SMBE meeting in Vienna.
PLEASE NOTE: Abstracts for oral presentations can
still be submitted until 8th of February. Deadline for
abstracts for poster presentations 29th March.
Speciation is a fundamental evolutionary process: this
process involves every living organism and its rates mir-
ror atmospheric and geological changes on Earth, but its
mechanisms are still largely a mystery. Usually, specia-
tion is dened by mating barriers, which can arise ether
slowly, due to growing divergence between geographi-
cally or ecologically separated groups, or immediately,
due to ploidy change.
Speciation research covers a broad array of scientic
elds, starting from molecular and cellular biology to
evolutionary biology. A rapidly growing amount of as-
sembled genomes and transcriptomes make possible to
study speciation in much more detail than before. Look-
ing at patterns of genomic divergence, identifying foot-
prints of selection, or mapping genes that are involved
in reproductive isolation are just a few of the powerful
genomic approaches that recently become available to
study speciation. Today it is not rare that speciation
research pushes the existing knowledge to frontiers of
technologies and advanced algorithms.
This symposium will welcome research in model and non-
model species integrating emerging themes and novel
approaches, together with a reassessment of more tradi-
tional methodologies in order to understand why and
how organisms diversify.
The invited speakers that will open the symposium
are Luca Comai (UC Davis) and Christian Lexer (Uni-
versity of Fribourg). We encourage submissions from
researchers active in this area working on any system.
Students and postdocs are particularly welcome. Check

SMBE 2015: Symposium on \Inference of demography
and selection under violations of the Kingman coalescent
assumptions"
Dear Colleagues, We are pleased to invite you to at-
tend our symposium on Inference of demography and
selection under violations of the Kingman coalescent
assumptions to be held during the annual conference of
the society for molecular biology and evolution (SMBE)
in Vienna, July 12th-16th 2015.
* Symposium description: Most of the population genet-
ics theory and statistical tests for selection in genomic
data have been developed following the Kingman's coa-
lescent model. However, these theoretical premises rely
on biological and life-history assumptions which are of-
ten violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant
species. In this symposium we highlight recent develop-
ments in population genetics theory taking into account
previously ignored pervasive ecological and biological
characteristics such as the skew in ospring production,
fast adapting microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi),
long term resting stages or dormancy, and life cycles
with alternating sexual and asexual cycles. We welcome
theoretical and empirical studies investigating how these
new assumptions aect nucleotide polymorphism, and
the inference of adaptation and speciation processes
compared to the Kingman model. We focus specically
on pioneering applications in 1) Darwinian medicine to
understand the evolution of parasites, 2) disease man-
agement in agriculture to predict pathogen response to
selective pressures, 3) the management of marine genetic
resources to deploy sustainable sheries, 4) the control
of emergent diseases, and 5) the genomics of crop and
animal domestication.**

CharlesU NightingaleSpeciation
Two PhD positions on nightingale speciation available
from October 2015!
(http://web.natur.cuni.cz/ ~radkas/index.php?page=-
opportunities)
We are looking for motivated PhD students for the
following projects:
1. Genomics of reproductive isolation in nightingales
Understanding the mechanisms of speciation is a major
goal of evolutionary biology. Population genomics be-
comes an increasingly important tool for this research
eld and allows to investigate mechanisms and genetic
basis of species formation even in non-model organisms
that are not amenable to classical laboratory crosses.
The aim of this PhD project is to elucidate the genetic ar-
chitecture of reproductive isolation between two closely
related song bird species, the Common Nightingale (Lus-
cinia megarhynchos) and the Thrush Nightingale (L.
luscinia). Using novel genotyping approaches based on
next generation sequencing and previously developed
species-specic SNP markers, the student will genotype
several hundreds of DNA samples from naturally oc-
curring hybrid populations between the two nightingale
species, already collected during our previous research.
The obtained data will allow us to investigate genome-
wide patterns of interspecic gene ow and identify
genomic regions responsible for nightingale speciation.
Furthermore, we will use admixture mapping to ex-
amine genetic basis of several traits that are likely to
contribute to prezygotic as well as postzygotic reproduc-
tive isolation in nightingales. Combination of admixture
mapping with genome-wide patterns of introgression
will enable us to infer the importance of dierent repro-
ductive barriers in nightingale speciation. The student
will be mainly responsible for the laboratory part of the
project. We expect a motivated student interested in
population genetics and evolutionary biology with at
least basic training in molecular genetic techniques.
2. Interspecic competition and ecological dierentia-
tion in nightingales
Ecological character displacement, i.e. morphological
divergence of species caused by interspecic competition,
is an important process contributing to the origin of
biological diversity. In hybridizing taxa, it can facilitatethe process of speciation by adding an additional de-
gree of reproductive isolation between incipient species.
In our previous study, we revealed that secondary con-
tact between two closely related nightingale species, the
Common Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and the
Thrush Nightingale (L. luscinia), resulted in divergence
in the beak size in sympatry suggesting partitioning of
food resources between species. Such divergence should
be maintained by strong selection not to be erased by
interspecic gene ow. At the same time, local compo-
sition of nightingale food remains unknown. To better
understand selective forces responsible for the morpho-
logical divergence in beak size, the PhD student should
perform a detail survey of food supply and habitat com-
position in territories of both species in sympatry and
allopatry. Moreover, we will study nightingale diet di-
rectly using neck collars and emetics on trapped birds,
together with blood sampling and taking morphological
measurements. Combination of morphological and eco-
logical data with simultaneously gathered genomic data
will allow us to examine genetic basis of bill size diver-
gence and to infer the importance of bill size divergence
in reproductive isolation. We are looking for a motivated
student with good experience in eld ornithology, able
(after some training) to work independently in harsh
eld conditions.
Eligibility: Candidates must have nished the MSc. (or
equivalent) by September 2015 at the latest.
Time and place: Student will work in a young multidis-
ciplinary team based at the Faculty of Science, Charles
University in Prague, Czech Republic. Fieldwork will
be conducted in Poland. The position is available for
up to four years, starting in October 2015.
Supervisor: Radka Reifov a (Department of Zoology,
Charles University, Prague) Co-supervisor: Ji Reif (In-
stitute for Environmental Studies, Charles University,
Prague)
Salary: The PhD candidate's net monthly income will
start at 11.500 CZK (ca 410 EUR) in the rst year, and
may progressively increase with experience and achieve-
ments during the study. (Note that living expenses in
the Czech Republic are generally lower than in Western
European countries.)

DeakinU MultivariateEvolution
Ph.D. Scholarship in Multivariate Evolution: Experi-
mental evolution of multiple trait interactions under
changed environments
I have a Ph.D. scholarship available for a rst class
student starting in 2015 or 2016 at the Waurn Ponds
(Centre for Integrative Ecology) campus of Deakin Uni-
versity, Australia. The research takes advantage of my
long term experimental evolution project which inves-
tigates multivariate evolution of male colour pattern
components, female colour preferences and colour vi-
sion in 12 guppy mesocosms under three dierent light
environments.
General topic: Quantitative genetics of experimental
evolution of colour patterns and behaviour in guppies
and its relationship to trait functions and functional
interactions.
General aims: To examine the pattern, processes and
causes of evolution of the G-matrix (genetic variance-
covariance matrix) of multiple colour pattern compo-
nents and their links to mate choice behaviour in popu-
lations which are actively evolving under dierent visual
conditions. We are explicitly interested in the pattern
and process of multivariate evolution under divergent
environmental conditions. Questions include: What are
the eects of correlational selection on the G-matrix?
Does the form of the G-matrix inuence multivariate
evolution in the predicted ways? You can also investi-
gate the causes of correlational selection, for example:
Does correlational selection of colour pattern compo-
nents result from their interacting eects on chromaticFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 37
and luminance contrast and hence on their ecacy as
visual signals? There are a lot of dierent possible av-
enues of research so long as they investigate the patterns
and process of multivariate evolution; I encourage all
my students to follow the lines most interesting to them
provided it is practical in the 3 years of research. If
you are interested in any aspect of this, please email me
(John A. Endler): John.Endler@deakin.edu.au
Eligibility requirements: In addition to the gen-
eral PhD requirements at Deakin (see the website
http://www.deakin.edu.au/students/research-degrees-
doctoral-and-masters) you will need some experience
with quantitative genetics techniques and some
multivariate statistics. Experience with MATLAB or R
analysis is particularly welcome. First preference will
be given to Australian citizens or permanent residents
(the rules here) but if no appropriate candidates apply,
I will give the fellowship to the best non-Australian
who applies. You should be able to provide a very
strong undergraduate record and letters of recommen-
dation. Unlike other Australian scholarships, I do not
expect you to have published any papers, in fact I'm
highly suspicious of publication of work done as an
undergraduate. However, you should denitely show
your merit in your undergraduate record and letters of
recommendation. These documents should also show
that you are creative, original, innovative, and analytic
rather than just a technician or a paper mill.
Stipend: Standard APA rate (AU $25,849 in 2015) with
standard conditions in regards to extensions and other
allowances.
Dates and details: The closing date for applications is 1
July 2015; and the successful applicant should start no
later than February or March 2016, sooner if possible.

Studentship opportunities still available:
Project 1: Evolution of habitat specialisation in the
Arctic char
The evolution of multiple divergent phenotypes in post-
glacial lakes has occurred repeatedly and independently
in many sh taxa including salmonids (e.g. Salmo,
Oncorhynchus, & Salvelinus species), the three-spined
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and smelt (Os-
merus species). In this study next generation sequenc-
ing methodologies will be applied to understanding the
evolution of char (Salvelinus alpinus) ecotypes in British
lakes, comparing multiple sympatric morphs in separate
lake systems. This studentship is open to all nationali-
ties (funded by the Durham University DDS program).
Selection of candidates begins January 14th 2015 and
applications must be in by that date.
Project 2: The relative contribution of genetic drift and
natural selection on founder populations of deer
Population bottlenecks and founder events are an impor-
tant part of evolutionary process, generating stochastic
variation among populations and potentially changing
evolutionary trajectories. Natural selection is a weak
force compared to genetic drift when population size
is very small, yet strong selection could overcome this.
In this study founder populations of reindeer (Rangifer
tarandus) on South Georgia and roe deer (Capreolus
capreolus) in the UK will be investigated using next gen-
eration sequencing methodologies to better understand
the relative importance of drift and selection following
founder events. This studentship is open to EU and UK
nationals (funded by the Whitehead Trust). Selection of
candidates begins January 14th 2015 and applications
must be in by that date.
Project 3: Role of habitat boundaries in the evolution
of population genetic structure in marine systems
A long-standing objective in evolutionary biology is to
understand the mechanisms and drivers that determine
the patterns and rate of dierentiation, and eventual
speciation among populations. Connectivity (the real-38 EvolDir February 1, 2015
ized potential for gene ow among populations) is key,
but there are various interacting factors that determine
the spatial and temporal pattern of movement. In this
study the student will take advantage of a well-studied
system where there is suspected to be an important
interaction between prey choice and gene ow for the
bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). While based
in Durham, this project will be co-supervised by Oscar
Gaggiotti in St. Andrews and Per Berggren in New-
castle. This studentship is open to UK nationals only
(NERC funding). The application deadline is February
2nd 2015.

Title: Bee foraging in fragmented landscapes
Supervisors: Dr Richard Gill (r.gill@imperial.ac.uk), DrFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 41
Samraat Pawar Department: Life Sciences
Increased agricultural practices have resulted in the
clearance and fragmentation of many natural habitats
posing potential challenges to wildlife such as insect
pollinators. For eusocial bees (e.g. honeybees & bum-
blebees), who provide a crucial pollination service, in-
creased oral habitat patchiness may increase foraging
demands making it signicantly more dicult to sustain
the colony's energetic requirements. It is thus important
we consider how environmental stressors set limits on
bee foraging performance and how human inuence(s)
may exacerbate these problems.
Alongside the habitat fragmentation issue, agricultural
practices present a 'pesticide exposure landscape' to for-
aging insects. Pesticide exposure is known to decrease
foraging performance whereby foraging bout duration is
prolonged in combination with less food being brought
back per unit foraging time1-2, yet we still understand
little about what specic behavioural mechanisms are
being aected and the knock-on eect to colony func-
tioning3.
This project will investigate how specic stressors set
limits on bee foraging performance. The results gained
from such experiments will then be used to inform and
develop spatial model(s)4 to look at the probability of
foraging success under given levels of habitat fragmen-
tation.
The research project will provide the PhD student with
a number of benets: i) it will integrate a number of
critical interdisciplinary skills including controlled exper-
iments and modelling; ii) it crosses a number of scientic
elds such as behavioural ecology, applied ecology and
theoretical biology; iii) the research is of high impact
and will result in quality publications as well as results
that can inform end users and policy makers; and iv)
the student will join a productive, diverse and social
research group.

Research focus
We are seeking a highly motivated doctoral student
to conduct research on the physiological adaptation
of prairie stream shes. The primary objective is to
utilize natural thermal gradients in spring-fed prairie
streams to study the eects of temperature variation
and variability both on individual and population level
responses. The project includes eld components and
analysis of long-term data sets to test how thermal
regimes aect population dynamics of grazing minnows.
In addition, laboratory experiments will be used to
quantify variation in eco-physiological traits within
and among species. The ultimate goal is to establish
how individual traits can be used to predict population
level responses. There is exibility for the student to
develop independent research within the broad scope
of the project. This research is a collaborative eort
between dierent labs at KSU. It will be conducted

This is a readvertisment as an additional funding stream
has come online. Can we ask previous applicants to also
apply to the CENTA stream.
Dear evoldir
A PhD studentship starting October 2015 is available
by competition to study the role of genomic imprinting
in social insect biology, jointly supervised by me (Dr
Eamonn Mallon ebm3@le.ac.uk) and Dr. Ezio Rosato
at the University of Leicester. Further details at http:/-
/bit.ly/1bRFqnL Project outline: This project will at-
tempt to establish the role of genomic imprinting in the
important pollinator species, the bumblebee Bombus
terrestris. Genomic imprinting is the dierential expres-
sion of alleles in diploid individuals, with the expression
being dependent upon the sex of the parent from which
it was inherited. Genomic imprinting is an important
area of research in plant breeding and in evolutionary
biology and has relevance to some human cancers and de-
velopmental syndromes. Bees are potentially a model for
genomic imprinting because theyhave a small, sparsely
methylated genome. The PhD student will carry out
all experiments and bioinformatic analysis under the
guidance of the supervisory team. They will be provided
with training in R, a powerful and increasing popular
statistical programming language, Python, a general-
purpose, high-level programming language widely used
in bioinformatics, molecular biology, RNA-seq, anatom-
ical dissection and neuroanatomy, in situ hybridisation,
confocal microscopy and bee husbandry as required.

Graduate student positions in Plant Evolution at McGill
University, Montreal.
Position 1. Self-incompatibility is the most eec-
tive method by which owering plants enforce out-
crossing and maintain a system of mating that the
negative consequences of inbreeding depression in
progeny. The self-incompatibility system in the
Brassicaceae is perhaps the best characterized one.
We have recently found exciting evidence suggest-
ing that this system has evolved more than once
within the family (http://www.plosbiology.org/article/-
info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001560). We
are looking to recruit a graduate student (M.Sc. or
Ph.D. level) to assist us in furthering this investigation.
Position 2. Climate change is producing new ecological
challenges for plants in this century (e.g., temperature,
water stress conditions). When phenotypic plasticity is
insucient for plants to cope with such challenges, they
must either adapt evolutionarily or face local extinc-
tion. We are exploring how next generation sequencing
approaches can help us to better understand the under-
lying genetics and evolutionary genomics of this process.
We would like to recruit a graduate student (Ph.D. level)to work on this problem in our lab.
Please send me your CV and a brief statement detail-
ing: (1) which position you are interested in applying
for; (2) why you are interested in the position and any
relevant experience you may have; and (3) the names
of 3 people we may write to for letters of reference.

evolution and systematics. One of our current research
areas is the biology of the crop wild relatives of sweet-
potato, a small clade of morning glories, the Batatas
group. We are developing an understanding of the evo-
lutionary relationships and population genetic structure
of this hybridizing complex. The potential master's
projects (listed below) will complement our molecular
systematic investigations. The ultimate goal is to un-
derstand the evolutionary relationships of the crop wild
relatives and traits of potential importance that can be
used for improvement of sweetpotato. This research is
being carried out in collaboration with an international
team of systematists, evolutionary biologists, and crop
scientists studying the genomics, systematics of the crop
wild relatives, as well as breeding sweetpotato to meet
challenges from pathogens and climate change.
We have a broad understanding of the evolution and
systematics of morning glories. Our lab is equipped
for both molecular studies and eld research. We have
a large collection of morning glory germplasm, an ex-
cellent greenhouse, and experimental gardens at LSU
agriculture station in Hammond.
RESEARCH PROJECTS: (1) Taxonomy of the Batatas
complex: The current taxonomy of the sweetpotato crop
wild relatives is provisional and could benet from a
revision using an expanded sample, as well as being
informed by recent molecular systematic results. This
project would include a geomorphometric analysis of
corolla and sepal shape to aid in species delineation.
(2) Crossing studies among members of the Batatas
group: The fourteen species of the Batatas group exhibit
varying levels of interfertility. We want to document
levels of interfertility among populations within the com-
plex to help explain the observed genetic structure. We
also want to determine those crosses that may allow
traits to be bred into the cultivated sweetpotato, which
is a hexaploid.
(3) Studies of drought resistance among the sweetpotato
crop wild relatives: Sweetpotato is commonly grown
on small farms that are often challenged by changing
weather. Drought is one of the main conditions reducing
sweetpotato production. We will use greenhouse stud-
ies and eld experiments to examine levels of drought
resistance in the crop wild relatives to identify popula-
tions that could provide important characteristics for
crop improvement. This research area also allows for
studies of the ecophysiology of morning glories, which
are widespread weedy species found throughout the
Americas.
ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IN OUR LAB: (1) System-
atics of morning glories: We have an ongoing research
eort to study the systematics of morning glories. Wehave an excellent understanding of the broad groups
within morning glories (tribe Ipomoeeae) and are poised
to develop more focused studies of particular clades.
(2) Coevolution of the morning glory/fungal symbiosis
that results in the production of ergot alkaloids: It has
long been known that morning glory seeds contain ergot
alkaloids. Recently it was determined that these alka-
loids are produced through the symbiotic interaction
between morning glories as hosts and Periglandula, an
epibiotic fungi. We are interested in the evolution of
the symbiont at both the intraspecic level and among
morning glories and Periglandula in general.
SUPPORT: Teaching assistantships will be available
on a competitive basis. You will teach introductory
biology labs and have a great opportunity to have gain
important teaching experience.
QUALIFICATIONS: Bachelor's degree and qualifying
GPA and GRE scores. It is useful to have prior
research experience. Most important is identifying
your own research interests that are consistent with
the ongoing research in our lab. Useful informa-
tion regarding our graduate program can be found
at http://www.southeastern.edu/acad research/depts/-

RIALS: A cover letter identifying your research interests,
resume, transcripts, GRE scores and arrange for two
letters of recommendation. Please contact Rick Miller
(rickmiller@selu.edu) to discuss your interest in our lab
and the details of the application process (one to the
Biology department and a separate application to the
Graduate School).
DEADLINE OF APPLICATION: Fall 2015 application
deadline is 1 February.
FACULTY: The graduate faculty has strengths in or-
ganismal biology including such areas as sh and snake
systematics, turtle physiology, buttery ecology, envi-
ronmental microbiology, and amphibian ecology.

SwanseaU MicrobialGenomics
PhD studentship in Immunology and Evolutionary Mi-
crobial Genomics (Swansea University, UK)
General description: Research will be conducted un-
der the direct supervision of Dr. Thomas Wilkinson
and Professor Samuel K. Sheppard, and based in the
Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Dis-
eases at the College of Medicine of Swansea University
(United Kingdom). The successful student will join
a team of multi-disciplinary scientists working in the
MRC Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics
(CLIMB) Centre and the BBSRC-funded medical mass
spectrometry team. More information on the research
group can be found on http://www.sheppardlab.com/
. Project details: Early and rapid detection of infec-
tion is a major goal of Clinical Microbiology. In par-
ticular an ability to dierentiate between sepsis and
other non-infectious causes of systemic inammation
such as Systemic Inammatory Response Syndrome
(SIRS) is particularly pertinent as it will determine
antibiotic administration. Recently, we and others
have identied 25-hydroxycholesterol as an important
inammatory mediator regulating the production of
pro-inammatory IL-1 driven responses. To date these
studies have linked inammation with the antiviral in-
terferon response. In this context less is known about 25-
hydroxycholesterol and bacterial infection. This project
will investigate whether major bacterial pathogens, in-
cluding Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter and Es-
cherichia coli generate unique metabolic signatures of
25-hydroxycholesterol and its degradation products. We
will use the whole genome data of over 5,000 bacterial
isolates organised in our online databases to select the
major disease causing clones for host / pathogen whole
blood modelling prior to Mass Spectrometry analysis of
isolated sera.
The project will focus on two major areas of host
pathogen interactions: i) the cellular response of the
organism and host; ii) the population genomics of mi-
crobes so that host responses specic to a species or
evolutionary conserved lineages of pathogens can be
identied.
Requirements: Enthusiasm and practical experience in
immunology, microbiology, molecular techniques and
computer-based genetic analysis is necessary but train-
ing and support will be provided to strengthen theseareas. The successful candidate will be highly moti-
vated, creative, independent and have a good degree in
immunology, molecular biology, microbiology, bioinfor-
matics, genetics or ecology (BSc or MSc, 2:1 or 1st only).
Previous experience in a molecular biology/immunology
laboratory or in bioinformatics research is also strongly
desirable. Good English writing and oral skills are es-
sential.
Details: - The duration of the studentship is 3 years
(2015-2018). - The position is open until lled, but a
preferred deadline for application is 31st July 2015, to
allow for registration to start in the Fall semester. - The
position is fully open for UK and EU students. - Salary
will be commensurate with regular UK postgraduate
stipends, i.e. $13,863/year ( ~euro 18,425/year), tax-
free. - Tuition fees are fully covered by the studentship. -
Students will also have opportunities to attend national
and international conferences during their candidature
and a chance to compete for internal College of Medicine
travel bursaries.

GRADUATE STUDENT POSITIONS at the UNIVER-
SITY of CALGARY
Local adaptation and the architecture of complex traits:
theory and comparative genomics Sam Yeaman AIHS
CAIP Chair in computational evolutionary biology
I'd like to take this opportunity to invite prospective
graduate students to apply for positions in the lab that I
will be starting in the Department of Biological Sciences
at the University of Calgary in September 2015. In
particular, I am looking for candidates that are inter-
ested in working on de novo genome assembly, mapping,
and comparative genomics or analytical and simulation-
based population genetic theory. I have received fullfunding from AIHS and U of C to cover two research
projects (see descriptions below):
1) Theoretical exploration of the eect of demography
and environment on genomic signatures of local adap-
tation 2) Comparative genomics of rearrangements in-
volving genes associated with local adaptation
Graduate student positions will include full funding
($21K/year) is available through a combination of lab-
supported stipends and TA-ships oered through the
University of Calgary. Of course, I encourage students
to nd their own funding (e.g., NSERC, Eyes High and
AIHS), and will oer additional support to students that
come with partial or full funding of their own. While I
have several ideas for graduate student projects, I will
encourage students to explore their own ideas, as long
as they align with my broad interests.
TO APPLY: Please send a CV and a short description of
your interest in the position to yeaman@zoology.ubc.ca,
along with the names and emails of three people I could
contact for reference letters. Please be sure to clearly
highlight any skills and experience related to genome
assembly, NGS library prep, statistics, bioinformatics,
or programming. I will begin reviewing applications on
February 1st, 2015, but please contact me to check in if
you need to make a quick decision.
POTENTIAL RESEARCH PROJECTS:
1) Theoretical exploration of the eect of demography
and environment on genomic signatures of local adapta-
tion
Theory has shown that migration-selection balance can
shape the architecture of local adaptation, but testing
this theory using genomic data remains a major chal-
lenge. The aim of this project is to extend existing
theory to make explicit predictions about the eect of
realistic demographies and environments on genomic sig-
natures of local adaptation. In particular, I am planning
to focus on recurrent conditionally-deleterious mutation
as a source of load and on haplotype-level signatures of
local adaptation. This work will use individual based
simulations to explore these ideas and the development
of new statistical tools to describe the patterns we nd.
I am also keen on exploring the eect of spatial + tem-
poral heterogeneity on the evolution of genome archi-
tecture through small rearrangements. I typically use
Nemo (written in C++) but am open to other ideas and
approaches.
2) Comparative genomics of rearrangements involving
genes associated with local adaptation
Theory shows that migration-selection balance favours
the xation of rearrangements that build clusters50 EvolDir February 1, 2015
of genes involved in local adaptation (Yeaman 2013,
PNAS). Recent empirical work has shown that loci with
signatures resembling local adaptation in the threespine
stickleback tend to be clustered together (Jones et al.
2012, Nature; Miller et al. 2014, Genetics). To test
whether these putative clusters have evolved through
rearrangements, this project will undertake de novo
assembly of the genomes of several close and distant rel-
atives of the threespine stickleback. In combination with
existing and emerging genomic resources, we will recon-
struct the long-term patterns of genome rearrangement
in this group and test hypotheses about the involvement
of selection and local adaptation. This study has full
funding for 7 years, and will employ a combination of
Illumina short reads, PacBio long reads, and potentially
some physical and linkage mapping, or other innovative
methods. I also plan to undertake comparative genomic
studies in other taxa where more genomes have already
been assembled (Arabidopsis, Helianthus, Solanaceae,
Cichlids, etc.).
Beyond these projects my interests tend to be quite
broad, so if you have a cool idea and want to work with
me, I'd love to hear about it!

The ability to respond appropriately to the environment
(e.g. temperature, day length, presence of females or
same-sex rivals) is crucially important. Therefore the
detection of environmental cues, and integration of infor-
mation from them, are vital. Recently, there has been
much interest in modelling the underlying biological
mechanisms responsible, using 'neural networks'. Our
recent work suggests that the response of male fruit-
ies to conspecic mating rivals can be modelled via
this type of network. The aim is to test this idea and
identify the alternative pathways involved. This will
be done via the analysis of RNA sequencing data of
the transcriptomes of males with manipulated sensory
systems.

The engineering of adaptation: Exploring the genetic
basis of biomechanics and function in an exemplar adap-
tive radiation
Project summary:
Adaptive radiations provide a fascinating framework
for evolutionary investigations. In many cases such ra-
diations are characterized by substantial variation in
craniofacial anatomy which relates to ecological func-
tion. African cichlids provide what is considered by
many to be the most dramatic example of an adaptive
radiation, especially with regards to craniofacial vari-
ation where species have adopted an incredible degree
of specialization. However, despite possessing such a
wide range of phenotypes African cichlids can share
a largely similar genetic background. This makes for
highly tractable investigations into the genetic basis of
craniofacial biomechanics and function. For this project
we aim to leverage the wide range of craniofacial phe-
notypes available in African cichlids as well as their
recently derived genomic resources. Specically, we aim
to determine 1) the genetic basis of adaptive craniofacial
shape and bone structure, 2) verify candidate genes by
testing their function, and 3) identify the mechanisms
underlying jaw joint formation and its biomechanical
properties. This project will take advantage of an in-
terdisciplinary supervisory team which spans basic evo-
lutionary biology, development, genetics, anatomy, and
engineering. Therefore, this project will involve a broad
range of training and interdisciplinary skills. We are
seeking an enthusiastic student with knowledge in only
some of these areas, and a willingness to learn from
dierent elds. A prior degree in engineering is not nec-
essary as this is a biologically driven project, although
applications from a range of academic backgrounds is
welcomed.
If this project if of interest please make all initial contact
with Dr. Kevin Parsons (Kevin.Parsons@glasgow.ac.uk).

The Research Training Group \Biological responses to
novel and changing environments - RESPONSE" (RTG
2010), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
(DFG), invites applications for
12 Ph.D. positions.
The RTG is based at the University of Greifswald, Ger-many (www.uni-greifswald.de [1]).
Starting date: April 1st 2015. Duration: 3 years. Salary:
German salary scale (TV-L 13, 65%).
Research Program
The ability to respond to novel and changing envi-
ronmental conditions, either by phenotypic plasticity,
genetic adaptation, or range shifts, is pivotal to the
longer-term survival of all organisms. Owing to increas-
ing concerns about the consequences of human-induced
global change, such responses have attracted increas-
ing interest in recent years. RESPONSE focuses on
the plastic and genetic capacities for in situ responses
(cluster A) and on the factors limiting or facilitating
dispersal to new habitats (cluster B). The RTG aims at
deepening our understanding of the limits to population
persistence, enabling more accurate predictions regard-
ing the fate of populations under changing conditions.
Our research program spans dierent levels of biological
organization, ranging from molecular and physiologi-
cal mechanisms to ecological population-level responses,
and a wide variety of organisms including myxomycetes,
plants (trees), and animals (snails, crustaceans, insects,
spiders, bats). Please refer to www.uni-greifswald.de/-

eld work at least to some extent.
Teaching Concept
A teaching program accompanies the interdisciplinary
research strategy. It covers dierent scientic topics
and techniques relevant to the RTG as well as soft skills
relevant to career development, and includes summer
schools, journal clubs, practical courses, lectures, and in-
dividualized educational as well as mentoring programs.
Each Ph.D. project involves visiting stays at dierent
laboratories, partly abroad. The participation in the
teaching program is mandatory.

ULeicester HumanSTRDiversity
PhD studentship: Next-generation sequencing ap-
proaches to short-tandem repeat sequence variation:
mutation processes, haplotype evolution and forensic
application
A fully funded four-year BBSRC CASE PhD Stu-
dentship is available with Prof Mark Jobling and Dr
Jon Wetton to use next-generation sequencing (NGS)
to study the internal structure of human short-tandem
repeats. These markers are universally used in forensic
analysis, but genotyping considers only allele length,
and not allele sequence. The next decade promises to
bring the power of NGS to bear on forensic identica-
tion, yet little is known about what new opportunities
and problems sequence data will bring. The project
will address the following questions: i) What is the in-
ternal sequence variability of autosomal and Y-STRsin human populations? ii) How are sequence variants
(e.g. variant repeats, microdeletions) related to linked
SNP variation? iii) What does the information from (i)
and (ii) add to our understanding of microgeographic

PhD Studentship at the University of Liverpool, UK:
The spatial ecology of host-parasite communities
Supervisors:
Profs Andy Fenton and Mike Begon (University of Liv-
erpool)
Dr Amy Pedersen (University of Edinburgh)
Prof Owen Petchey (University of Zurich)
With on-going concerns about zoonotic diseases and
increasing cases of emerging infectious diseases, it has
never been more important to understand disease dy-
namics in natural populations. Parasites exist within hi-
erarchies of biological organisation (infecting individual
hosts, within populations, within communities, across
landscapes). Infection therefore depends on multiple
factors (parasite transmission mode, host characteris-
tics, host location, environmental characteristics etc).
Separating these factors is a major challenge. Metacom-
munity theory may provide the tools to understand how
these factors interact to determine parasite community
structure. To develop and test these approaches we need
high resolution, spatially structured host and parasite56 EvolDir February 1, 2015
datasets, which are very rare.
We have 6 years' worth of longitudinal data of wild
rodents and their parasites (nematodes, cestodes, pro-
tozoa, viruses, bacteria) at ne temporal scales (every
2-4 weeks) under spatially-hierarchical sampling (traps
within grids within woodlands). These data provide a
unique resource to explore the spatial ecology of para-
sites.
This studentship will explore how environmental and
individual-level factors interact to determine infection
risk and parasite community structure. The student will
explore: (1) the extent to which parasite communities
vary across space, (2) whether there are 'hotspots' of
infection by dierent parasites, and (3) the roles of indi-
vidual and environmental factors in driving infections.
This work will primarily use our existing data, although
the student could conduct their own experiments as
needed.
This project will suit students with interests in commu-
nity and/or disease ecology, and particularly those with
strength in statistical analyses. The student will work
with ecologists with considerable experience in natural
disease systems, and will receive training in concep-
tual, quantitative and empirical aspects of host-parasite
ecology.
The studentship is part of the NERC 'ACCE' Doctoral
Training Partnership, and will be based at the Univer-
sity of Liverpool, where the student will be a member of
the highly-active research groups of Professors Fenton
and Begon, and part of a wide-ranging research environ-
ment, spanning the Universities of Liverpool, Edinburgh
and Zurich.
This studentship is fully funded for UK residents, but
fees only for EU and International citizens. For infor-
mal enquiries please contact Professor Andy Fenton
(a.fenton@liverpool.ac.uk). Applicants should send a
CV, cover letter and contact details of two academic

PhD Studentship: Genomics and genetic architecture
in a wild bird
Supervisor: Jon Slate (University of Sheeld); collabora-
tors: Ben Sheldon (Oxford), Marcel Visser (Netherlands
Institute of Ecology), Martien Groenen (Wageningen).
This project is part of the recently funded Centre for
Advanced Modelling (see below) at the University of
Sheeld. The student will utilise a recently collected
dataset of 600,000 SNP genetic markers, typed in ap-
proximately 2000 great tits, making it one of the largest
genetic datasets for any natural population. The aim of
the project is to understand the genetic architecture of
quantitative traits in a population of great tits that has
been the focus of a long-term individual-based study,
running since 1947. One of the aims of the project will
be to determine whether an individual's genome can
predict its phenotype. So-called genomic prediction or
genomic selection underpins modern animal and plant
breeding, as well as personalised medicine, but it has
never been attempted in the context of environmental or
ecological research. The project builds on an ERC grant
previously held by JS and will run alongside a recently
funded NERC grant on genomic prediction. There will
be opportunities for the student to collaborate with
great tit ecologists in Oxford and with ecologists and
genome biologists at NIOO-KNAW and Wageningen
University in the Netherlands. The laboratory and
phenotypic data are already collected so the project
is risk-free in terms of data collection. The project is
ideally suited to a mathematics, physics or computer
science graduate, or to a biological sciences graduate
with evidence of strong quantitative skills (e.g. MSc in
genomics or bioinformatics related discipline). Enquiries
to Jon Slate (j.slate@sheeld.ac.uk).

The Centre for Advanced Biological Modelling (CABM)
will harness cutting edge mathematical and computing
skills to address major problems in biology. Biology at
the University of Sheeld is dened by its strength in
combining approaches across time-scales from ecological
to evolutionary, and has been the subject of signicantrecent investment. Exploiting this breadth of research
excellence, the areas of focus for the CABM will extend
our cutting edge research in basic biology by harnessing
the latest mathematical and computational techniques.
The recruitment process of the CABM will focus on
attracting outstanding students from the physical and
mathematical sciences, and training them to address
leading biological problems. This multi-disciplinary
initiative will transform our research excellence in or-
ganismal biology and ll a chronic training gap in the
biology. Its legacy will be a cohort of research scientists
at the cutting edge of biological modelling with the skills
to tackle major societal problems.

Adaptation (note the deadline for receipt of applica-
tions is 8th January)
Mark Chapman (Centre for Biological Sciences, Univer-
sity of Southampton) and Mark Carine (Department of
Life Sciences, Natural History Museum) are looking for
a PhD student to study how gene expression variation
relates to plant adaptation.
Summary: With climate change likely to lead to major
changes in the world's biota and to impact on our ability
to grow crops, it is pertinent to understand how plants
adapt to dierent ecological regimes, in particular those
diering in temperature. A thorough investigation of
groups of species which have adapted in parallel to dif-
ferences in altitude would shed light on the genes and
pathways that are involved in adaptation to tempera-
ture.
This project focuses on the Canary Islands ora, an
ideal model for such a study since recent speciation in
the ora has been governed in part by altitudinal (and
thus temperature) shifts.
The project will characterize phylogenetic relationships60 EvolDir February 1, 2015
of endemic lineages in diverse taxa to identify altitudi-
nally dierentiated sister taxa. Divergence in gene ex-
pression between these taxon pairs will be characterised,
and loci exhibiting a signature of divergent selection
will be identied. By using study taxa drawn from di-
verse angiosperm families we can address the question:
are parallel genetic changes responsible for evolutionary
changes underlying temperature adaptation?

SalmonPopDynamics
PhD Position, Finland: Population dynamics and evo-
lutionary genetics of life history variation in Atlantic
salmonFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 61
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student who
is enthusiastic about working in an inter-disciplinary
environment. The studentship is a part of a research
consortium that aims at integrating evolutionary genet-
ics, ecological modelling and environmental sociology to
understand the external drivers of life history changes
in a heavily shed Atlantic salmon population complex
and to advance sustainable use of these aquatic natural
resources. This project has been recently funded as a
part of the Finnish Academy Arctic Research program.
The Teno River, located in northernmost Europe, sup-
ports one of the largest and most biodiverse naturally
reproducing stocks of Atlantic salmon in the world. The
Teno salmon monitoring programme, that has been
running for 40+ years and involves close co-operation
between scientic research and local shers, provides
multiple sources of data for this project. In addition
to long-term catch data, it includes an archive of over
100,000 scale samples, containing information on, for
example, life history strategies and growth rates of the
Teno salmon across four decades. These samples also
provide a source of DNA for genetic monitoring and
linking genotype and phenotype. Statistical inference in
the project will focus on several particularly intensively
monitored populations within the Teno population com-
plex, and aim at broadening the understanding of the
overall population dynamics of Teno salmon. Genomic
research will focus on understanding the genetic basis
of life history traits studied in the ecological modelling
component e.g. age-at-maturity and repeat spawning.
The PhD student is expected to contribute both to the
genomic and ecological data analyses, and therefore
enthusiasm for, and experience with, population genet-
ics and/or ecological modelling is desired. A strong
background in mathematics, (Bayesian) statistics, bioin-
formatics or genomics is an advantage. Depending on
the interests of the student, there are possibilities to
work in the genetics lab and/or participate in eldwork
on the Teno River. Informal inquires and applications
(as a single pdf le) should be addressed to Prof. Craig
Primmer (craig.primmer@utu.). Applications should
include a CV (with names and contact details of at least
two referees), and a max. 2 page letter of motivation.
Undergraduate students who are yet to graduate should
also include a letter from a faculty member indicating
an estimated graduation date. Review of applications
will commence on Feb 28 with the preferred starting
date being June 2015. The position is available until
(and therefore expected graduation date is) the end of
2018. The starting salary is 2171 EUR per month.
The supervisors of the project are Craig Primmer, Uni-
versity of Turku, Finland (http://users.utu./primmer/-
), Jaakko Erkinaro and Henni Pulkkinen, Natural Re-sources Institute Finland (www.luke.). The student
can be based at either of the supervisors departments in
Turku or Oulu, but will be required to spend extended
periods in both locations.

toxin produced by this fungus. Our current projects
involve the ability of certain plant secondary metabo-
lites to stop growth and/or toxin production by As-
pergillus. Future research directions will include inves-
tigations of the molecular mechanisms by which these62 EvolDir February 1, 2015
plant compounds alter fungal metabolism. We also are
interested in the role of Aspergillus in colonization of
plastics labeled biodegradable, in agricultural settings.
Aspergillus is a key colonizer of such plastics but its
ability to break down polymers is unclear, as is the
extent of toxin formation during plastic colonization.
Dave Hooper: Plant Community and Ecosystem Ecol-
ogy. I will be accepting one graduate student in fall
2015. My local research is currently focused on assessing
ecosystem services associated with dierent scenarios of
riparian restoration in Whatcom County. Student work
would combine GIS analyses of ecosystem services and
eld work, particularly on nutrient retention, to vali-
date modeling results. I also have opportunities focused
on analyzing large data sets to understand aspects of
biodiversity loss and assembly of plant communities.
Robin Kodner: Marine Microbial Metagenomics. The
Kodner lab does interdisciplinary work integrating ma-
rine microbial ecology with comparative genomics and
bioinformatics for metagenomes. I am recruiting for
one student for work on bioinformatics projects. Some
experience with sequence analysis and programming
required.
Ben Miner: Students in my laboratory focus on how
marine organisms alter their morphology and behav-
ior in response to dierent environmental conditions,
typically biotic conditions. Current projects in my lab
include research on wasting disease in sea stars, predator-
induced hatching plasticity in marine animals, context-
dependent inducible oenses and defenses in marine
organisms.
Craig Moyer: My interests are marine microbiology and
geomicrobiology focusing on molecular approaches for
exploring microbial diversity, community structure and
ecological interactions. Presently, my lab and I are
focused on the study of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobac-
teria acting as the ecosystem engineers in microbial
mats found at strong redox boundaries, including seep,spring and vent habitats. We are also examining the
evolutionary divergence of surface and deep subsurface
Zetaproteobacteria in hydrothermal systems.
Merrill Peterson: Ecology and Evolution of Insects. The
primary focus of our lab is on insect diversication and
diversity. Potential graduate student projects include:
1) experimental investigation of the mechanistic basis
of sperm precedence in hybridizing Chrysochus beetles,
2) analyses of the factors inuencing insect species rich-
ness in rapidly-declining natural habitats in the region
(e.g., lowland prairies, coastal dunes), and 3) using a
database of the regions moth collections to document
community-wide responses to climate change.
Lynn Pillitteri: Plant Molecular and Developmental
Biology. A potential graduate project in my lab would
be aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms
driving cell type dierentiation in the model organism,
Arabidopsis thaliana.
Dietmar Schwarz: Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics
and Genomics, Evolutionary Ecology. Schwarz's lab
oers opportunities to study speciation, hybridization,
and adaptation in host specic insects (apple maggot
ies and relatives) on a USDA supported project. Stu-
dents may also have the opportunity to collaborate with
Alejandro Acevedo-Gutierrez on non-invasive molecular
studies of seal foraging ecology.
Anu Singh-Cundy: Plant Physiology. We study plant re-
production at the physiological, cellular, and molecular
levels. Current projects are focused on understanding
the role of HD-AGPs, which are proteins that promote
pollen tube growth, in members of the Solanaceae and
also in Arabidopsis.

The National Science Foundation <http://-
www.nsf.gov/about/ >(NSF) is seeking candidates for
Program Director in the Systematics and Biodiversity
Science Cluster (SBS) within the Division of Envi-
ronmental Biology (DEB), Directorate for Biological
Sciences (BIO) in Arlington, VA.
The DEB supports fundamental research on popula-74 EvolDir February 1, 2015
tions, species, communities, and ecosystems. Scientic
emphases range across many evolutionary and ecologi-
cal patterns and processes at all spatial and temporal
scales. Areas of research include biodiversity, phyloge-
netic systematics, molecular evolution, life history evolu-
tion, natural selection, ecology, biogeography, ecosystem
services, conservation biology, global change, and biogeo-
chemical cycles. Research on origins, functions, relation-
ships, interactions, and evolutionary history may incor-
porate eld, laboratory, or collection-based approaches;
observational or manipulative experiments; synthesis
activities; as well as theoretical approaches involving
analytical, statistical, or simulation modeling.
The SBS cluster supports research that advances our
understanding of the diversity, systematics, and evolu-
tionary history of organisms in natural systems. This
research addresses fundamental questions in biodiversity,
taxonomy, and phylogenetics, such as: What kinds of
organisms exist in the natural world? How are they
related? How did evolution lead to patterns of global
biodiversity in time and space? How can phylogenetic
history shed light on evolutionary patterns and pro-
cesses in nature? Example topics include: expeditionary
biodiversity research and discovery; identication and
classication of organisms; and phylogeny and compara-
tive phylogenetic biology. The SBS Cluster seeks to fund
projects that are transformative - that is, those that in-
novatively and fundamentally transform our approaches
to analyzing and understanding global biodiversity, its
origins, distribution, and evolutionary history. The
Cluster places a high value on integrative and holistic
approaches to systematics research and training - i.e.,
those approaches and projects that integrate across all
the components within the cluster (biodiversity discov-
ery, organismal biology, taxonomy, phylogenetics, and
evolution) and that train highly integrative systematists
who can conduct research across the entire spectrum of
these activities.
The responsibilities of the Program Director include
long-range planning and budget development for the
areas of science represented by the program or pro-
gram cluster, the administration of the peer review
process and proposal recommendations, the preparation
of press releases, feature articles and material describing
advances in the research supported, and coordination
and liaison with other programs in NSF, other Fed-
eral agencies and organizations. Additional duties and
responsibilities include the following:
PROGRAM PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
* Maintains a healthy balance of support for all the needs
of the research and education enterprise through pro-
gram, division, directorate, Foundation, or interagencyactivities. * Manages program resources to provide op-
timal appropriate scientic judgment to insure integrity
and consistency in the grant/declination process without
conicts of interest, and with balance among appropri-

qualied scientists. * Manages an eective, timely merit
review process, with attention to increasing the size and
quality of the reviewer pools and insuring participation
by women, minorities and disabled scientists. * Pro-
vides scientic expertise, evaluation and advice for other
programs in NSF, including international programs, and
other research programs, and cross-directorate programs.
* Advises and assists in the development of short-and-
long range plans, establishing goals and objectives for
support of research programs. * Plans the budget for
the program considering past, present and future scal
years, allocates resources within the budget by distribut-
ing scarce resources among competitive projects, and
manages post-award evaluation.

Alabama K-12ScienceStandards
Draft
Dear Evoldir Members, The new Alabama Course of
Study in Science is now available for public comment un-
til 30 January 2015. This is the framework for K-12 sci-
ence education in Alabama's public schools. We encour-
age members of the Evoldir to comment on this draft.
The link to the standards can be found on this page:
http://www.alsde.edu/dept/coss/Pages/welcome.aspx .
Why Comment?
1. The standards do not include evolution. If you
search the document, \evolution" (n=4) is found only
in the Preface. For example: \Since natural selection
has been observed to play a role in inuencing small
changes in a population, it is assumed, based on the
study of artifacts, that it produces large changes, even
though this has not been directly observed." 2. Al-
abama requires an evolution disclaimer in every pub-
lic high school biology textbook, and this has been
the case since 1996! (http://ncse.com/news/2011/03/-
creationism-alabama-standards-006570) The new stan-
dards include much of this language in the Preface. 3.
Alabama has been rated by the NCSE in 2009 as the
state with the lowest quality K-12 science standards.
The current draft is only a draft. With enough substan-
tive comments from the public, the new standards could
be improved. 4. It is easy to comment. See http://-
www.alsde.edu/dept/coss/Pages/forms.aspx. We sug-
gest reviewing and commenting on the Front Matter
(Preface) and 9-12 Biology sections because they are
most relevant to evolutionary biology.
Please help us make a dierence to improve science
literacy by adding your suggestions to the public draft
(http://www.alsde.edu/dept/coss/Pages/forms.aspx).

Awake letter
Dear EvolDir
The following letter was written in response to mis-
quotation of my work by Jehovah's Witnesses in their

be of interest to the membership of EvolDir. I would

Evolution, Religion, Reason - An open letter to Jeho-
vah's Witnesses
Editor of Awake (Magazine) Jehovah's Witnesses
Dear Editor,
I am writing to protest your Awake Magazine article,
\The origin of life - ve questions worth asking", dated
January, 2015\, in which you have misquoted me by
taking half a sentence out of context from my article
on evolution. Contrary to what you imply, I do not
support a creationist view, nor do I suggest that even a
minority of scientists support such a view. Anyone who
reads my article can see that I fully support the theory
of evolution (Singh 2011).
In my article, I follow the paragraph from which you
have misquoted me with material showing why the facts
of evolution are hard to comprehend for many people.
My article is meant for people who want to understand
evolution but who do not have the expertise to do so,
not for creationists like you who oppose evolution on
religious grounds.
Your misquotation amounts to intellectual dishonesty
and reects on your character and dignity as editor as
well as a man of God. I can understand that you do not
accept evolution as an explanation for the biodiversity
on this planet, but I cannot understand why you would
knowingly misuse a scientist's work to make him appearFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 89
supporting the creationist point of view.
I have received inquiries from many evolutionists, athe-
ists and former members of your organization (ex-JW)
who brought the above misquotation to my attention. I
agree with them that your misquotation of my work is
deliberate and meant to convince your followers in the
truth of creationism by perpetuating false support from
scientists.
So I am asking you rst to remove the misquotation
from your article immediately and second print an un-
conditional apology for what I consider is a deliberate
damaging action on your part to my reputation.
The goal of religion is to seek truth, to remove ignorance
and fear, not to perpetuate myths and lies. As a man of
religion you may have the need for God and as a man of
science I may not. But we both should be on the same
side when it comes to the pursuit of truth. Believers
need truth as much as non-believers do.
If I may suggest, as an organization you should stop
wasting your time in perpetuating lies against evolution.
Religion and science need each other. As Einstein re-
marked, religion is lame without science, and science is
blind without religion. Religion and science are both
driven by reason but they operate in dierent domains.
Religion seeks absolute truth, science proceeds through
incremental steps. Religion is the reason to keep science
marching.
The Catholic Church and its leaders, including Pope
Pius XII, Pope John Paul II, and most recently Pope
Francis, have albeit slowly but progressively accepted
evolution and do not see conict between religion and
science. God is not a magician, as Pope Francis said,
and it's insulting to human intelligence to put every-
thing at God's door. Jehovah's Witnesses should feel
liberated in supporting evolution as it would free you
from proselytizing false doctrine and allow you to dig
deeper into the meaning and the mystery of life.
Accepting evolution does not bar you from believing in
God and vice versa. This is exactly what many Hindus,
Buddhists, and Jains do. All these religions came from
the same trunk and yet Buddhism and Jainism were
atheistic in their origins. Hindus' theory of reincarna-
tion making God progressively appear in the dierent
eons in the form of sh, turtle, boar, lion, a small man, a
full man, Rama, Krishna, Buddha, and the future Kalki,
represent an evolutionary ladder in higher organisms.
According to Hindu texts, there are 8.4 million life forms
(yoni/species) and the life (jiv) in all of them comes
from the same source, implying a common origin. The
literal theory of rebirth meaning life going through all
8.4 million life forms is obviously an evolutionary pro-gression up the ladder if life. Hindus have no problem
with believing in evolution and God at the same time.
Furthermore, not believing in religion and God does
not mean that one has no interest in the origin and
evolution of the universe and in the bigger questions of
life. Atheists do not believe in organized religions or
faiths, but atheists are as much interested in the bigger
questions life and death as you are. Atheists too can be
loving and kind. Let me give you an example:
"When Gandhi was developing his non-violent strug-
gle movement for the freedom of India, he was also
mounting a campaign against the social ills

Two eld assistant positions to study oxidative stress in
relation to social status in house sparrows in Switzerland.
We are seeking for two (2) research assistants for the
upcoming breeding season to join a project investigating
the impact of oxidative stress and social status on the
development of reproductive strategies in house sparrow.
The research will be conducted in Bern, Switzerland.
The work will start on 1st of April and will continue
through early/mid July. Our project investigates how
males with dierent positions in a dominance hierarchy
allocate their antioxidant resources to the protection of
their sperm vs. the protection of their somatic functions,
and how such allocation strategies aect the quality of
the sperm they produce. The project is based at the
University of Neuchatel, Switzerland (PI Prof. Fabrice
Helfenstein, PhD student Alfonso Rojas), but will be
conducted at Hasli, Bern, Switzerland. The work of
the volunteers will consist in carrying out an experi-
ment in aviaries with house sparrows. This includes
assisting the PhD student with catching and banding
birds, behavioural observations, sample collection, data
management and data analysis. During the conduct of
the experiment we work 7 days a week and 10-12 hours
a day. Qualications: (1) BSc or higher in Biology or
similar qualication (2) Ability to work and live in small
groups and sociable personality (3) Fluent in English90 EvolDir February 1, 2015
(French and/or German are a plus, but not essential)
(4) Ability to endure long working days (5) Knowledge
in observing & handling birds is a plus (6) Driving li-
cense. This is a volunteer eld assistant position, thus

**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2015 Call for Appli-
cations**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility grants for
young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Friday 16 January 2015, 12.00 GMT.
Eligibility:
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. The maximum single award will be
2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or a
period of research at a lab that you have not previously
visited. There is no restriction on the country of resi-
dence or nationality of the applicant but preference will
be given to applicants who are unlikely to be able to
fund the proposed work by other routes. Preference will
also be given to self-contained or 'seed-corn' projects,
rather than fundamental elements of already-funded
PhD or postdoctoral projects, and to projects with a
denable output that is achievable within the scope of
the GHM award. A report will be required by 30 April
2016, by which time the funds must have been used.
Application procedure:
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to

SeabirdEvolution
Dear EvolDir,
We are looking for a voluntary research assistant to
help us during our eld season for our ongoing seabird
research. The deadline for applications is the 31st Jan
2015 and we can only accept applicants who have per-
mission to work in the UK. I would be highly grateful if
you could post/circulate the advert below in the EvolDir
community.
Many thanks and best wishes,

Voluntary research assistantship in seabird behaviour &
ecology Skomer Island & University of Oxford
We are looking for an enthusiastic, hardworking young
biologist to work as a voluntary Research Assistant
to help with our pelagic seabird research on Skomer
Island, Pembrokeshire, Wales, in Spring and Summer
2015. The work will involve several research projects co-
ordinated by Prof Tim Guilford at Oxfords Department
of Zoology (see the OxNav website). We utilise state-of-
the art tracking technologies (miniature GPS, geoloca-
tors, time-depth recorders & on-board video) on several
species (Manx Shearwaters, Atlantic Puns, Common
Guillemots, Razorbills). Most work will involve assist-
ing doctoral students with the day-to-day maintenanceof the study burrows, weighing and monitoring breed-
ing birds and their chicks, and the deployment and
retrieval/downloading of tracking devices. It will also
involve entering data collected in the eld into appro-
priate databases. There will be a signicant amount
of nocturnal work, since the primary study species is
the Manx Shearwater, which only arrives at the colony
after dark. There will also be scope for involvement in
other conservation and ecological projects on the island,
which is a National Nature Reserve administered by the
Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.
Unfortunately we cannot provide a stipend but accom-
modation (shared and basic) on Skomer will be covered.
However, the project is a great opportunity to gain
valuable experience in modern eld ornithology. There
will also be opportunities for the assistant to learn some
analytical techniques applied to animal movement data.
Skomer has mobile coverage and some access to Inter-
net, however movements to and from the mainland are
limited because of unpredictable wind conditions. There
is a small community of wardens, assistants and volun-
teers, who are involved in the running and conservation
of the Nature Reserve, monitoring the seabird popula-
tions, and managing the daily and over-night visitors.
There might be opportunities to visit other UK island
reserves during the project.
Prole: we are looking for a motivated and hardworking
biologist, who likes working in the eld and can cope
with dicult working and living conditions. Previous
experience in the eld or in harsh conditions is desirable,
but not essential. Work on Skomer requires long hours
(with some work at night and at dawn) spent in a cold
and wet environment and considerable manual work. A
good candidate should be able to work independently
and have a reasonable level of tness. Planning to em-
bark on further research degrees in the future would be a
plus (previous assistants have engaged in doctoral stud-
ies afterwards). It is also important that the assistant
feels comfortable sharing sometimes crowded accommo-
dation with a number of colleagues over long periods
of time, and can cope with the occasional untidiness
inevitably associated with eldwork. Unfortunately, for
administrative reasons, we can only accept applications
from people having permission to work in the UK (UK
and EU citizens, UK residents, or persons with a UK
work permit).
We are looking for an assistant to work with us be-
tween April and September 2015. If you are in-
terested, please email a CV and a statement of
interest and arrange for two letters of reference
to be emailed to tim.guilford@zoo.ox.ac.uk (with
oliver.padget@zoo.ox.ac.uk in cc). The deadline for
submitting applications (including reference letters) isFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 95
the 31st January 2015. We will interview the shortlisted
candidates (on Skype) shortly after and we expect to
make a decision by late February.

PlantEvolSymposia funding
*Funding of up to $43k is available to run symposia
with slots available from 2017 onwards. Application
deadline is 28th February 2015.*
If you are interested in organising a
New Phytologist Symposium, please com-
plete the proposal pro forma ( http://-
www.newphytologist.org/app/webroot/img/upload/-
les/NPS%20proposal pro%20forma2015(1).docx
) and email this to the Managing Editor (np-
managinged@lancaster.ac.uk) by the end of February.
Feel free to get in touch with any queries or for guidance
on completing the proposal.
The internationally renowned series of New Phytologist
Symposia (NPS) aim to support emerging and key areas
of research. Usually these meetings would be expected
to extend over one to three days, with invited speakers
and a maximum of 120 delegates. In this way we hope to
provide an informal atmosphere for the stimulation and
exchange of ideas and the building of collaborations. We
particularly encourage the involvement of early career
scientists and as such a number of travel grants will be
awarded in association with each meeting.
Information about past and upcoming symposia can
be found here: http://www.newphytologist.org/-symposia We also welcome workshop proposals
throughout the year and we can support workshops
scheduled from 2016 onwards. To submit a pro-
posal for a workshop download and complete the
proposal pro forma ( http://www.newphytologist.org/-

managinged@lancaster.ac.uk). Further details can be
found on the website: http://www.newphytologist.org/-
workshops or feel free to get in touch with any
queries.
New Phytologist Workshops aim to facilitate advances
in plant science by bringing together a small number of
scientists (up to 20) who wish to focus and brainstorm
a particular topic or issue. The format is intentionally
exible to suit a range of projects, but this might, for
example, include a working group that intends to focus
on analysing new data or indeed analysing old data
in the light of new techniques and planning the way
forward. Awards are usually in the region of $5-10k.

PLANTS Grants
Applications for the PLANTS program are now open
and due by March 1, 2015. This program will fund
up to 12 US undergrads to attend the Botany 2015
meeting of the Botanical Society of America and af-
liated societies July 25 - 29, 2015 in Edmonton, Al-
berta, Canada. Meeting topics range across all levels
of botany, including ecology, conservation, biodiversity,
plant genomics, evolution, plant systematics, and botan-
ical education. Peer mentors and senior mentors work
with PLANTS students and attend talks with them,
introduce them to colleagues, and generally make the
meetings a welcoming place for them. There are also
a number of social functions and career-oriented activi-
ties, specically targeted at students for networking and
fun. The meetings are a great way to understand the
breadth of botanical research and education, to meet
undergraduate and graduate students with similar in-
terests, and to network with professionals in your area
of interest. The program covers the normal costs of
travel, registration, and food and accommodation at
the meeting. An overview of the scientic conference
will be available at www.botanyconference.org APPLI-
CATIONS DUE BY MARCH 1, 2015: Applications
(http://www.botany.org/Awards/F PLANTS.php) are
open and due by March 1, 2015 and include your state-
ment of interest, a letter of recommendation, and un-
ocial transcripts. Applications are welcome from
all undergraduates who have interest in plant sci-
ence; the admissions goal is to create a diverse pool
of students attending the meetings. For questions,
please contact the organizers Heather Cacanindin (HCa-
canindin@Botany.org) , Ann Sakai (aksakai@uci.edu),

Sample management software
Dear colleagues,
we are searching a way to get rid of Excel tables of our
samples in Dropbox or network drives. Would you be so
kind and suggest solutions regarding the managementof samples? Our samples are regular molecular ecology
stu. Sometimes we have multiple samples from the
same individuum, and also multiple samples types. Oth-
erwise we do not need anything special. It would be
nice if the sample management could be online etc. To
be honest: We do not exactly know what we need ;-) We
rather wish to explore some options. If you can suggest
a software/system, would you as well very briey let me
know which are the pro and cons in your daily use, and
for what applications you have it? I'll of course repost
all collected info here on EvolDir in a few days.
Thanks in advance!
Cheers, Robert

Software DAMBE update
Dear Colleagues,
I have uploaded a new version of DAMBE with two
major revisions:
1. The addition of the index of translation elongation
(ITE, with four dierent implementations, and a num-
ber of codon tables for a subset of bacterial species).
The paper detailing I TE has been published by Genet-
ics been chosen as one of the highlights for the February
issue of Genetics (Xia, X. 2015. A Major Controversy in
Codon-Anticodon Adaptation Resolved by a New Codon
Usage Index (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/-
25480780)
2. An improvement of the search algorithm for DNAML
and DNAMP. You may compare the tree from DAMBE
against trees from PHYLIP's DNAML and other pro-
grams to see the dierence.
Please download to use it (I have also added quite a
number of undocumented features mostly related to
translation initiation and prokaryotic operon structure.
I will explain them in the future).
For those not familiar with DAMBE, it is a compre-
hensive software package for data analysis in molecular
biology and evolution, available free at:

Cooperative breeding in Damaraland mole-rats
(Fukomys damarensis), South Africa.
2 Positions:
15th of March 2015 to 14th of June 2015.
Mid-June 2015 to mid-September 2015.
We are looking for two voluntary eld research assis-
tants to conduct eld research on the completely sub-
terranean, highly social Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys
damarensis). Specically, this project investigates the
group augmentation hypothesis and how benets of liv-
ing large groups can generate selection for altruism in
animals. We plan a large scale capture-mark and re-
capture experiment running over one year in which the
voluntary research assistant would play an important
role. Field work takes place in the southern Kalahari,
Northern Cape province of South Africa. Entire groups
of mole-rats will be captured and individually marked.
Morphological measurements and tissue samples will be
obtained before the release of the animals. The work isphysically extremely demanding (long hours, heavy dig-
ging to capture mole-rats) and weather conditions are
very challenging (heat during the day, very cold during
the night). Field work will make trapping during the
night necessary. The assistant will mostly be working
along one more experienced scientist but will need to
work independently at times.
Applicants should be enthusiastic, willing to work hard
and keen to get involved in an ecological research project
in the African bush. Research assistants are expected
to be willing to work at night when trapping schedules
require it and need to be t as capturing mole-rats re-
quires the capacity to do hard physical work (digging) in
a challenging environment. Applicants must be holders
of a driving license. A zoology related degree and/or
previous eld experience will be considered an asset.
The successful applicants will work in a small team of 2
persons and hence need to be a team player and gener-
ally a person that enjoys collaboration under sometimes
challenging and isolated circumstances.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants are
paid a monthly allowance to cover their food.
Applications received until the 12th of February 2015
are ensured full consideration. Later applications can
be considered (particularly for the second time period).
Dates for the second period are more exible and appli-
cants can indicate if they wish to commit for a longer
period.

Switzerland Internship BatEvolution
Internship for undergraduate/ Master's degree student
for the bat project
Topic: Impact of oxidative stress on alternative repro-
ductive tactics in bats.
Context: Oxidative stress is considered to be a major
mechanism impacting on life history trade-os. Carollia
perspicillata, a neo-tropical bat, shows two reproductive
tactics, with harem males defending a territory, and
bachelor males. Our hypothesis is that bachelor males,
because they have less mating opportunities will invest
more in sperm quality then harem males. The project
is based at the university of Neuch ~Atel, Switzerland.
We study a captive bat colony (Papiliorama http://-
www.papiliorama.ch). Bats can y freely under a 40m-
diameter dome, which includes an articial cave. The
light cycle is reversed, allowing us to work during theday. Therefore, it is a unique opportunity to study bats,
animals still largely unknown.
Tasks of the intern, in collaboration with the two PhD
students working on the project:
- Planning of the experiment
- Help to feed the bas that are in cages during the
experiment
- Participation in blood and sperm collect
- Behavioral observation
- Possibility of lab work
About the position:
- It can be part of your studies. Therefore, the candidate
is welcome to conduct a personal research project.
- Not paid, but housing could be reimbursed for two
month maximum
- Minimum duration of two months, possibly starting at
the end of February.
Please feel free to contact us if you have any ques-
tions. To apply, please send a CV and a cover letter to

Field Assistants Required-North American red squirrels
Kluane, Yukon, Canada
We are looking for 3 volunteers to assist with eldwork
for the period of February 20 to the end of May, 2015,
and a further 5 volunteers from May through August
(please note: there is the exciting possibility of linking
this position with a 'sister study' on Columbian ground
squirrels in Alberta. See below). The positions are
part of a long-term study of red squirrel population
dynamics. As a member of the study, assistants will be
involved with monitoring the reproduction and survival
of individuals. Fieldwork will involve live-trapping and
handling of animals, radio-telemetry, behavioural obser-
vation, and climbing trees to nd young in nests. This
is an excellent opportunity to gain experience working
with a collaborative research team on a long-term study
of a wild mammal.
All eldwork is carried out in the beautiful backdrop of
southwestern Yukon, Canada. We will be staying at a
rustic eld station two hours from Whitehorse. Food
and accommodation are provided. Volunteers are re-
quired to provide for their own travel to Edmonton,
Alberta; however, travel from Edmonton to the eld
station (and back again!) is provided.
Training will be provided and no experience is necessary,
but candidates should have an interest in a number of
the following: ecology, evolutionary biology, wildlife,
eld biology, and animal behaviour. The eld camp is
remote and low tech (no showers, cell phone service, or
internet), so successful applicants must enjoy the out-
doors and be able to remain a positive and responsible
team member under relatively isolated and demanding
conditions. Candidates must be in good physical condi-
tion, be willing to climb trees, and have an enthusiasm
for learning. We work on 'squirrel time', which often
involves long work days; as such, applicants must have a
strong work ethic. That said, the atmosphere at squirrel
camp is friendly and inclusive, and this area is one of
the most beautiful in Canada.
Columbian ground squirrel study: We are also involved
with a similar long-term study on Columbian ground
squirrels in Kananaskis, Alberta. We are thus able to
provide the opportunity for interested applicants to be
involved with both programs. Volunteers would be-
gin work on red squirrels in February and switch toFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 101
ground squirrels for May to August 31. Both projects
use a similar approach (lifetime monitoring using live-
trapping and observation), but are conducted in two
dierent landscapes and on species diering in natural
history (e.g., winter-active vs. hibernating). If you
are interested in this joint opportunity, please see our
advertisement on this webpage and mention it in your
application.

Video suggestions
I am teaching a second year evolution course for the
rst time, and am wondering if anyone can recommend
any videos that illustrate any aspects of evolution, from
basic HW theorem through adaptation (e.g. sexual se-
lection, form-and-function, senescence, human health)
to evo-devo. I am using Herron & Freeman as the text,
so that is the level of education that I am aiming for.
I just want to give the students (and me) a couple of
breaks from regular lectures. 50 minute videos would
be ideal, but shorter ones would also be useful. Thank
you.

CancerPhylogeneticMethods
The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University
and the Center for Evolution and Cancer is searching
for a Postdoctoral Research Associate to help develop
methods to reconstruct the phylogenies of cell lineages
from within neoplasms. This will require the develop-
ment of new likelihood models and the integration of
multi-modal data (e.g., point mutations and chromo-
somal alterations). Initial data will derive from SNP
arrays and exome sequencing of Barrett's esophagus
tissue samples. We will also work on developing meth-
ods to extract regularities across forests of phylogenetic
trees from tumors.
The Center for Evolution and Cancer was the rst of
its kind to apply evolutionary biology to cancer biology
both at the cell level, studying the evolutionary dynam-
ics of carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance, and
at the organismal level, studying the evolution of can-
cer suppression in whales, elephants and other species.
Scholars will be part of a highly interdisciplinary re-search team led by Dr. Carlo Maley, will collaborate
with Mary Kuhner in Joe Felsenstein's lab, and also
be part of a larger community of interdisciplinary re-

Evolution and Medicine and the Centre for Evolution
and Cancer at the Institute for Cancer Research in
London, bringing together evolutionary biologists, ecolo-
gists, computational biologists, mathematical modelers,
cancer biologists and oncologists to make fundamen-
tal discoveries in understanding cancer and improving
cancer prevention and management.
Interactions among faculty, Postdocs and students across
the Institute and the University are central to a variety
of ongoing research and educational programs. These in-
teractions allow our Postdoctoral Research Associates to
develop their expertise in research and build towards an
independent research program. Faculty, Postdocs and
students are actively involved with a number of other
centers, institutes, and research groups on campus that
promote transdisciplinary approaches to issues of local
and national signicance, aording outstanding research
and training experiences that extend beyond traditional
disciplinary boundaries. The Biodesign Institute is a re-
search hub that makes an important contribution to the
advancement of ASU as a leader of knowledge generation
and utilization.
Qualications:
Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, computational biology,
bioinformatics, biostatistics, or related eld. Experience

ing by only one or two aminoacids from the onneural
isoforms due to microexons (see Cell 2014, 159:1511-23),
are expected to be crucial for terminal neurogenesis and
synaptic function, and unique to vertebrate species. The
applicant will mainly use zebrash as a model organism
to investigate these questions. In addition to these, the
candidate will be encouraged to develop his/her own
scientic ideas.

Calgary AdaptationGenomics
POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITIONS at the
UNIVERSITY of CALGARY
Local adaptation and the architecture of complex traits:
theory and comparative genomics Sam Yeaman AIHS
CAIP Chair in computational evolutionary biology
I'd like to take this opportunity to invite prospective
postdocs to apply for positions in the lab that I will be
starting in the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Calgary in September 2015. In particu-
lar, I am looking for candidates that have strengths in
de novo genome assembly, mapping, and comparative
genomics. I have received full funding from AIHS and
U of C to cover a project on \Comparative genomics
of rearrangements involving genes associated with local
adaptation" (see description below for more details).
Positions will run for 2+ years, with the possibility of
extension for another 2+ years. Full funding is avail-
able through either a dedicated two-year fellowship of-fered through the University of Calgary ($50k/year) or
through my research budget. For this project, I would
like to nd a collaborator that has experience with NGS
library preparation and de novo genome assembly or
linkage mapping, although candidates without direct
experience in these areas but with strong bioinformatics
AND wetlab skills would also be most welcome.
TO APPLY: Please send a CV and a short description of
your interest in the position to yeaman@zoology.ubc.ca,
along with the names and emails of three people I could
contact for reference letters. Please be sure to clearly
highlight skills and experience related to genome as-
sembly, NGS library prep, statistics, bioinformatics, or
programming. I will begin reviewing applications on
February 1st, 2015, but please contact me to check in if
you need to make a quick decision.
Project description: Theory shows that migration-
selection balance favours the xation of rearrangements
that build clusters of genes involved in local adapta-
tion (Yeaman 2013, PNAS). Recent empirical work has
shown that loci with signatures resembling local adap-
tation in the threespine stickleback tend to be clustered
together (Jones et al. 2012, Nature; Miller et al. 2014,
Genetics). To test whether these putative clusters have
evolved through rearrangements, this project will un-
dertake de novo assembly of the genomes of several
close and distant relatives of the threespine stickleback.
In combination with existing and emerging genomic
resources, we will reconstruct the long-term patterns
of genome rearrangement in this group and test hy-
potheses about the involvement of selection and local
adaptation. This study has full funding for 7 years,
and will employ a combination of Illumina short reads,
PacBio long reads, and potentially some physical and
linkage mapping, or other innovative methods. I also
plan to undertake comparative genomic studies in other
taxa where more genomes have already been assembled
(Arabidopsis, Helianthus, Solanaceae, Cichlids, etc.).

CardiU FishAdaptation
A position is available for a Research Associate (Post-
doc) to conduct research on sh biology, disease and
bioinformatics, in the topic:
Minimising the Impacts of Intensive Aquaculture in the
face of Climate Change
Institutions Involved:Cardi University,Swansea Univer-
sityand Aberystwyth University Collaborators:Natural
Resources Wales (NRW), Cardi Harbour Authority
(CHA), Wye & Usk Foundation (WUF), Natural Apti-
tude, Fishgen, Skillsh, Pontus Aqua, CIBIO
Worldwide demand for sh and shellsh has increased
9% annually over the last few decades and is expected
to reach c. 180 million tons by 2015, most of which will
have to come from farmed sh, as the majority of wild
sheries are either stagnant or grossly over-exploited.
However, to achieve long-term sustainability and meet
food security demands, aquaculture needs to diversify
and to step-up the domestication of aquatic species,
which will have to thrive on less food, less space, and
less water, all compounded by warmer temperatures
and disease.
The AquaWales Research Cluster combines academic
(Swansea, Cardi and Aberystwyth Universities) and
non-academic participants, including stakeholders and
local government involved in policy and regulation, and
will target these challenges by capitalising on the di-
verse and complementary expertise of the group (from
behavioural ecology to genomics, citizen-science and
sheries policy). We will use a multidisciplinary ap-
proach to disentangle the basis of domestication and the
response to crowding (stress and parasite susceptibility),
an aspect often neglected in breeding programs, and to
investigate the potential eects of climate change on
the risk of expansion and establishment of non-native
aquatic species associated with aquaculture and sheries
using state-of-the-art methods. Specic aims include to:
1. bridge, for the rst time, the behavioural, genetic
and environmental (epigenetic) components of sh un-
dergoing domestication 2. disentangle the role of do-
mestication in disease resistance in response to stress
and temperature change, and 3. model pathways of in-
troduction and dispersal of aquaculture-related invasive
species (AIS) under dierent environmental conditions,
combining state-of-the-art methods for early detection(environmental DNA) and citizen science.
The Research Associate will work in collaboration with
a Research Associate based at Swansea and 2 PhDs al-
iated with this research cluster; the Research Associate
must also be prepared to work for short periods of time
in Swansea and/or Aberystwyth.
The main tasks of the Research Associate will be to
work on the relationship between domestication and
disease resistance under stressful conditions of crowding
and disease in tilapia and salmon, developing infection
protocols, culture assay methods and performing ge-
nomic/transcriptomic analyses.
The successful candidate will have a PhD in related sub-
ject area or relevant industrial experience, experience in
two of the following elds, sh behaviour, epidemiology,
genetics/genomics background or experience program-
ming in R/Python and proven ability to publish in
international journals.
This is a full-time position, xed-term until 30 Septem-
ber 2018
Salary: $31,342 - $37,394 per annum (Grade 6).It is
not anticipated that an appointment will be made above

Postdoc position: Why do animals have personality?
It's a pleasure to announce a postdoctoral position in
the research group of Dr Hanne L ~Avlie at Link oping
University, Sweden, on the topic of animal personality.
The project will focus on mechanisms underlying vari-
ation in personality, the link to variation in cognition
and learning, and the role of underlying variation in the
monoamine systems (i.e. serotonin, dopamine), and is
in collaboration with Prof. Svante Winberg (Uppsala
University).
Despite intense recent research interest, we still do not
know why animals have personality. This is partly be-
cause the architecture of animal personality is poorly
understood. The aim of the announced position is to
improve our overall understanding of the causes and
consequences of variation in animal personality. More
specically the aim is to investigate the relationship
between variation in personality and learning (together
with other aspects of cognition), and their underlying
genetic and physiological bases, with particular focus on
the brain monoamines serotonin and dopamine. In other
words, an exciting interdisciplinary project is oered
that aims to improve our understanding of the rela-
tionships between personality and cognition, and their
underlying mechanisms. We use the charismatic red
junglefowl and domestic chickens as our main models,
which together with excellent molecular tools enables a
strong experimental approach.
The post includes responsibility for conducting
lab/eldwork, carrying out behavioural and/or phys-
iological experiments, analysing data and writing up
results for publication. The postdoc will have access to
previously collected behavioural, physiological and ge-
netic data. To some extent is the topic of the project is
exible and can be tailored to t the skills and interests
of the successful candidate.
Funding is available for two years, but is contin-
gent on satisfactory progress in year one. The post
doc is a stipend (i.e. no tax will be deducted) of
20,000SEK/month. The stipend does not give enti-
tlement to sickness benet, parental allowance, holiday
pay or pension. Funding is awarded from Carl Trygger's
Foundation.112 EvolDir February 1, 2015
Requirements The successful candidate should be enthu-
siastic and dedicated to science, with a PhD and possibly
some postdoctoral experience in a eld of relevance to
the project (e.g. animal behaviour, evolutionary bi-
ology, molecular biology, quantitative genetics and/or
neurobiology). The candidate should have demonstrated
excellent quantitative and analytic skills, and excellent
communication abilities, particularly in written English.
The latter should be demonstrated by a proven track
record of publication. The candidate should also demon-
strate their ability to work as part of a team. Previous
experience of working with vertebrates, especially birds,
is advantageous, but not necessary.
If you are interested in this position, please send: (1)
a letter of motivation (including a brief description
of research experience and why you are suitable for
the announced position), (2) a CV including a list
of publications and contact details of two referees to:

2 Post doc scholarships in Evolutionary Biology
Placement: Department of Biology, Lund University,
Sweden Ref No: V 2014/2299 Duration: 24 months
Starting time: April 1 2015 or later following agreement
Last day for applying: January 31 2015
Research Area
Evolutionary biology is in a vibrant phase where data
from ecology, molecular and developmental biology are
coming together to shape our understanding of how
organisms evolve. These two postdoctoral scholarships
are intended to provide the opportunity to develop an
independent research project in organismal evolutionary
biology within a highly creative and supportive envi-
ronment. The successful applicants will be invited to
develop their projects in collaboration with the host
investigator Dr Tobias Uller.
We particularly welcome applications from those inter-
ested in the relationship between developmental, ecolog-
ical, and evolutionary processes. This includes, but is
by no means limited to, experimental and comparative
studies of the evolutionary causes and consequences of
phenotypic plasticity, non-genetic inheritance and de-
velopmental bias, and research projects on populations
in novel environments or at range margins. The focal
study organisms of the host research group are lizards
and water eas (Daphnia), and we will therefore aim to
develop a suitable project on these systems, but alterna-
tive study organisms will be supported if they are better
suited to the question and the research project is logisti-
cally feasible. Projects can be lab or eld based and can
be experimental, observational or comparative. We can
support a range of methods, from molecular genomics
to desk-based approaches, including comparative and
meta-analytical methods and mathematical modelling.
Why apply?
The intention with these scholarships is to enable early
career researchers to develop an interesting, cutting-February 1, 2015 EvolDir 113
edge, research project and give them sucient time to
complete the project and learn a wide range of skills. We
want to work with people who are passionate, intelligent,
and dedicated to advance our understanding of pheno-
typic evolution through collaboration and exchange of
ideas and expertise.
The successful applicants will be based in Dr Tobias
Uller's research group at the Department of Biology,
Lund University. They will join a growing team of
students and postdoctoral researchers with a broad re-
search agenda and a large international collaborative
network as full members of the Experimental Ecology,
Evolution and Behaviour group and the Evolutionary
Ecology Unit. Scholarships and research projects are
funded as part of a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship to
Dr Uller.
For further information about the host research
group and informal contact please visit http://-
www.biology.lu.se/tobias-uller or email Tobias Uller on
tobias.uller@biol.lu.se.
Qualications required
Applicants must have a PhD in a suitable area for con-
ducting postdoctoral research in evolutionary biology
and show evidence of high scientic potential. Such evi-
dence may include a strong track record of publications
in scientic journals, documentation of successful com-
pletion of research projects, high intellectual capacity
and problem-solving ability, technical know-how, organi-
zational skills, enthusiasm, dedication, and an ability to
work both independently and in a team. Where possible,
statements to these eects in the personal letter should
be accompanied by objective or independent assessment
of the candidate's track record and potential (e.g., via
letters of support; see below).
Applicants must have been awarded their PhD no earlier
than three years before the application deadline (this
may be adjusted based on, for example, documentation
of parental leave or military service).

Post Doctoral position in epigenetics and genome sta-
bility
We are welcoming applications from enthusiastic and
independent post-doctoral candidates to participate in
our FRM grant-funded project related to epigenetics
and genome stability. The fellowship is for 2 years and
should start before June 2015.
Background Genomic stability can be disturbed by the
activity of repeated sequences such as transposable ele-
ments (TEs). Epigenetic mechanisms allow the silencing
of these sequences. As a consequence, the presence of
TEs in a genome may aect the chromatin structure of
the regions in which they are inserted. Environmental
factors have also been described as aecting genome sta-
bility, namely by aecting the rate of transposition,, and
could be associated with environment related diseases
such as cancer.
Project The purpose of the project is to establish the link
between TEs, environment and epigenetics. Drosophila
is one of the best-tted model for this project since we
have an easy access to Drosophila natural variability,
the species genome is small and harbors low amounts of
TEs, and it is easily manipulated in the lab. The project
consists in the analysis of Drosophila responses to stress
by analyzing chromatin structure, piRNA abundances
and mRNA levels, with an emphasis on TEs.
Candidates The applicants are expected to have a strong
background in epigenetics with a conrmed interest in
genomics and evolutionary biology. Skills in data anal-
ysis and/or bioinformatics are necessary, but the can-
didate will benet from the LBBE bioinformatics and
statistical environment. The ideal candidate should be
highly motivated, curious and enthusiastic to work in a
collaborative team. Proven ability to identify research
objectives and meet agreed deadlines, self-motivation
and exibility are essential. Excellent written and oral
skills in English are required.
Environment The host laboratory (LBBE) is a stimu-
lating, cosmopolitan and pleasant place to work, where
one can meet biologists, computer scientists, mathe-
maticians and statisticians working on problems that
range from ecology to medicine, through genomics and
evolution. Lyon is the second largest city in France, is
famous for its food, is a UNESCO World Heritage site114 EvolDir February 1, 2015

Maynooth Ireland FungalGenomics
Dear all,
Applications are invited for a bioinformatics postdoc-
toral position in the research group of David Fitzpatrick
(Department of Biology, Maynooth University, Ireland).
My group is interested in genomics, transcripomics, pro-
teomics and molecular evolution of fungal species. The
project start date is the 1st of February 2015 and sets
out to investigate the genome of Agaricus bisporus.
Agaricus bisporus strain A15 is the most widely cul-
tivated white mushroom strain in Europe. Currently
there are signicant nancial and time costs associated
with ensuring A15 inoculum is genetically identical to
parent culture. This project sets out to undertake an
extensive genetic analysis of A. bisporus A15, via ge-
nomic and transcriptomic sequence analysis. Ideally this
genetic characterisation will act as the starting point
for development of a molecular diagnostic test to deter-
mine if new inoculum is genetically identically to parent
culture. We also aim to produce a high quality map for
the genome of A. bisporus A15. This will be invaluable
for future breeding of new A. bisporus strains.
The position will last for 18 months, with the possibility
of extension. I am looking for somebody who has experi-
ence in genome/transcriptomic assembly and experience
in handling large datasets. The successful candidate
will have published in peer-reviewed literature and have
their PhD awarded by the start of the project.
Send a CV and covering letter to

DragonyInvasionProcesses
*20 months Postdoctoral fellowship: Experimental stud-
ies on invasion process in a dragony species.*
At the Field Station of Experimental Ecology in Moulis,
France (CNRS V USR 2936)
*Project objectives*
The position is oered within a pan-European
project, Probis (Biodiversa, http://biodiversa-
probis.weebly.com/). PROBIS aims at characterizing
patterns of traits variation, and test for the underlying
evolutionary processes along an invasion succession.
More generally we aim at determining how the genetic
and phenotypic heterogeneity of invasive populations
along and age-gradient of invaded habitats is expressed,
and how this may inuence the invasion success and
rate of non-native species establishment.
The post-doc fellow will primarily work on the drag-
ony aspect of the project. This project will focus on
/Crocothemis erythraea/, a dragony originated from
Mediterranean areas and naturally expanding its range
northwards through Europe. In 2014, we rst sampled
populations along a South-North gradient to isolate
changes in the genetic diversity of populations, so as to
then identify specic populations that will be used for
experimental works. For the next steps, we will use 6
populations of dierent ages since the invasion started
across Europe.
The post-doc fellow will quantify the variation and plas-
ticity of phenotypic traits associated to each invasion
steps and create semi-natural populations into an ex-
perimental metapopulation system (Metatron, http:/-
/www.ecoex-moulis.cnrs.fr/spip.php?rubrique5) to ex-
perimentally measure population invasiveness.
*Task of the postdoctoral fellow*
The recruited researcher will be in charge of 1) collect-
ing dragony larvae in 6 populations across Europe, 2)
maintaining larvae in lab facilities, 3) planning and per-
forming phenotypic measurements (morphological and
behavioral), 4) maintaining and monitoring semi-natural
populations and movements between populations and
5) analyzing data and writing articles.
This work will likely lead to, at least, two articles as a
rst author.February 1, 2015 EvolDir 117
*Required skills*
Able to manage research and administrative activities
Knowledge in biological invasions and/or evolutionary
ecology in general.
Knowledge in entomology and possibly dragony biology
and rearing.
Able to actively participate as a member of a research

Rosco KelpLifeHistoryEvol
*/Postdoc position in evolutionary biology//
Kelp life history evolution and selection for aquacul-
ture.*
A two year postdoctoral research position is available
immediately at the Rosco Marine Laboratory, UMI
\Evolutionary Biology and Ecology of Algae" in France
(http://www.sb-rosco.fr/umi-3614.html). The aim of
the project is to use a combination of crossing exper-
iments and genetic analyses in order to improve our
basic knowledge of life history traits evolution in brown
algae and to implement kelp selection for aquaculture.
This position is funded in the context of the IDEALG
project (http://www.idealg.ueb.eu/).
Articial selection is crucial to algal aquaculture devel-
opment, and contrarily to many terrestrial plant species,
selection process in seaweed is in infancy, particularly in
Europe. The aim of the project IDEALG is to develop
basic research for selection process in seaweed aquacul-
ture incorporating rigorous evolutionary thinking into
it. Generally, seaweed populations are characterized by
large level of genetic dierentiation suggesting that pop-
ulations are adapted to their local environment. In this
context, parents that are too similar genetically may suf-
fer from reduced crossing compatibility due to inbreed-ing depression, whereas crosses between parents that
are too dierent genetically may lead to an outbreed-
ing depression by disrupting adaptive complexes. An
intermediate optimal outcrossing distance is therefore
expected as a compromise between inbreeding depres-
sion and outbreeding depression. In addition, seaweeds
display complex life cycles, involving an alternation of
haploid and diploid individuals. The consequences of
such cycles for the reproductive system have been little
studied experimentally. In particular, inbreeding depres-
sion is expected to be reduced as deleterious mutations
are removed from the genome during the haploid phase.
The objective of this project is to address these questions
combining crossing experiments with genetic analyses
in dierent kelps (in particular Saccharina latissima).
The eects of crosses on reproductive success will be
investigated by examining the evolution of crossing com-
patibility with increasing geographic distance. Number
of fertilizations and abortion rate will be measured in
single-male crosses in laboratory conditions, as esti-
mates of prezygotic and early postzygotic compatibility
between mates.
Applicants must have a PhD in evolutionary ecology,
in plant breeding or genetics. They must have a good
background in population genetics and demonstrable
experience in breeding experiments. Specic experience
on seaweed ecology and culturing is preferable.
Salary will be 2000 EUR to 2500EUR per month (net)
depending on experience. Applications are accepted
until 15 February, 2015 and should include CV together
with a description of research experience, relevant pub-
lications and 2 letters of references. Interview of the
selected candidates will be made from the 15 to the 28
February 2015.
Applications should be sent to Christophe Destombe
(destombe@sb-rosco.fr) and Myriam Valero (valero@sb-
rosco.fr). We prefer applications in electronic form. For
more information please contact Christophe Destombe

StellenboschU AntelopeGenomics
The Evolutionary Genomics Group at Stellenbosch Uni-
versity has a post-doctoral position available in the De-
partment of Botany and Zoology to investigate the struc-
tural organization (architecture) and genomic plasticity
of the meiotic genomes of African antelope. Large-scale
chromosomal changes such as inversions, translocations,
fusions and ssions \reshue" genomic segments provid-
ing new chromosomal forms on which natural selection
can work. Since these new forms are produced in the
germ line they can, at least potentially, be xed in pop-
ulations thereby providing new heritable allelic variantsthat are essential for the maintenance of genetic diversity
(Heredity 108 (1): 28-36).
There is extensive karyotypic diversity among African
antelope where genomic reshuing is often rapid and
many closely related species possess dierent karyotypes
indicating that chromosomal dierentiation often occurs
during, or shortly after cladogenesis. Our recent data
suggest that the number of meiotic DSBs initiated in
the early stages of meiosis and nal crossover events are
inuenced by how the genome is organized into chromo-
somes, and that there is a phylogenetic component in
recombination rates (Proc Biol Sci 280(1771):20131945).
This appears to be directional, strongly punctuated and
subject to selection. However, the mechanism(s) under-
lying this remain elusive and one of the aims of this
investigation will be to determine if antelope species
(with lower RR due to chromosomal fusions) similarly
show a lower number of ZnF repeats suggesting that
some Rb fusions may result in a modication of PRDM9,
or its promotors, and thus facilitate speciation.
The ideal candidate will have a published track record in
molecular cytogenetics, especially in meiosis. A strong
background in one or more the following areas would
be advantageous:
comparative genomics
molecular systematics
bioinformatics
The incumbent will work closely with researchers
in two other groups: Dr Aurora Ruiz-Herrera (Uni-
versitat Aut onoma de Barcelona, Spain, http://-
grupsderecerca.uab.cat/evolgenom/) and Professor Jiri
Rubes (Veterinary Research Institute, Czech Republic)
but will be located in the Stellenbosch lab. The ap-
pointment is for one year with the possibility of renewal
contingent upon satisfactory progress. This position is
available immediately.
Expressions of interest should be sent to Terry Robin-
son (tjr@sun.ac.za) and should include the names and
contact details of 2-3 referees, a full CV and a cover-
ing letter that highlights the appropriateness of your
expertise and why you are interested in the position.

StellenboschU Biogeography
Postdoctoral position, Stellenbosch University, South
Africa
Postdoctoral position in island biogeography (ecological
interaction networks)
Understanding the historic biogeographic processes that
shaped current species distributions, and thus the evo-
lution of dierent biotas, has become a central theme
in ecology. Such knowledge is crucial for understanding
how biodiversity is generated and maintained and for
developing eective management strategies. Specically,
biogeography is assumed to play an important role in
the structure of biological interaction webs (mutualisms,
antagonisms, etc.) and their co-evolutionary histories.
This assumption remains dicult to test under eld
conditions.
Truly puzzling and curious examples of biogeographic
anomalies exist in nature; these are ideal systems for
testing how biological interactions have diverged and
the extent to which geography explains these patterns.
For example, the diverse and speciose genus Acacia Mill.
(sensu stricto; previously grouped in Acacia subgenus
Phyllodineae) consists of about 1012 species, most of
them conned to Australia, with a few taxa found in
south-east Asia and Oceania. Two particularly pecu-
liar extra-Australian taxa are the closely-related island
endemics Acacia koa A. Gray found in the Hawaiian
Islands in the Pacic Ocean and A. heterophylla Willd.
from La R eunion Island in the Indian Ocean. This geo-
graphic disparity is truly remarkable, with ca. 18 000 km
separating these two insular landmasses. What makes
this even more interesting is that these two species are
considered each other's closest living relatives. Recent
work in our laboratory has revealed that A. heterophylla
from La R eunion Island represents a secondary coloniza-
tion event from the Hawaiian Islands and is therefore
the same species as A. koa (Le Roux et al. 2014). These
two taxa therefore represent one of the most astonishing
examples of long-distance dispersal.
This project will aim to compare and better understandthe ecological interaction networks of these two island
endemics by studying their interactions with other biota
(fungi and insects) in their native ranges (Hawaii and
La R eunion Island). This research will shed light on
how quickly speciation can happen and to what extent
geographic isolation can shape evolutionary trajectories
of interaction networks. Preference will be given to
applicants with strong interest in mycology and/or en-
tomology, molecular ecology, genetics, and evolutionary
biology. Applicants should hold a PhD degree. Pref-
erence will be given to candidates with postdoctoral
research experience, demonstrated skills in one or more
of the elds listed above, and an excellent academic
track record (i.e. publications in international journals).
Successful candidates will be fully funded for 1 year, to
be extended for an additional 1-2 years depended on sat-
isfactory performance. An attractive annual salary will
be oered along with additional expenses for research,
international travel and subsistence, and conference at-
tendance. Individuals of all nationalities are eligible.
Applicants should be prepared to spend extended peri-
ods in Hawaii and La R eunion Island.
To apply, please send a CV, contact details for at least
two academic references, and a brief outline of research
interests to Dr Jaco Le Roux (jleroux@sun.ac.za), Prof.
David Richardson (rich@sun.ac.za) and Prof. Mike
Wingeld (Mike.Wingeld@up.ac.za) by 16 February
2015. Informal inquiries are welcome. Review of appli-
cations will begin immediately, and short-listed candi-
dates will be contacted to set up phone/Skype inter-
views. The envisaged start date for the project would
be March/April 2015.

mammoth samples, with the aim to track changes in
genome-wide diversity leading up to the mammoth's
extinction on Wrangel Island. The principal goals of the
project are to investigate the genetic consequences of
small population size by assessing the timing and rate
of changes in heterozygosity, inbreeding coecients and
deleterious genetic variation. Moreover, the samples
span a time period that encompasses several well-known
environmental changes, and there is thus an opportu-
nity to explore the eect of changes in selection pressure
in real-time. From our perspective, an equally impor-
tant goal of the position is that it will constitute an
important step for the postdoctoral researcher towards
securing a position as an independent researcher. Be-
cause of this, we will also encourage the postdoctoral
researcher to design and pursue additional projects, to
obtain experience in student supervision, and to develop
his/her scientic network through collaborations and
participation in scientic meetings.
ENVIRONMENT: The position will be based at the De-
partment of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (SMNH). The museum is
located in Stockholm, which by many is regarded as one
of the most beautiful capitals in the world and is home
to a vibrant scientic community with several leading
research institutes, including Stockholm University and
the Science for Life Laboratory. The SMNH has a strong
mission in natural history research, and its research di-
vision has more than 170 employees. The department of
Bioinformatics and Genetics hosts three research groups,
focused on ancient DNA and population genetics (PI:
Dr. Love Dal en), avian systematics and biogeography
(PI: Dr. Martin Irestedt), and phylogenomics (PI: Prof.Fredrik Ronquist).
QUALIFICATIONS: The ideal candidate is a creative
and independent researcher, who by the start of the
project has obtained a PhD in biology or a related eld.
The PhD degree should have been received no more
than three years before the deadline for applications. A
record of scientic achievement in bioinformatics and
computational genomics is essential, as is previous expe-
rience in handling NGS data using scripts and analysis
pipelines. Additional merits include experience in com-
puter programming, population genetics and wet lab
analyses, as well as prociency in genome assembly and
annotation.

UKent Blastocystis adaptations
Postdoctoral Research Associate Position: Revealing
the anaerobic adaptations of the mitochondrion-related
organelles of Blastocystis.
We are looking to recruit an enthusiastic post-doc with
skills in molecular and biochemical parasitology and
proteomics.
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research fel-
low post at the School of Biosciences, University of Kent,
UK. This is a 3-year post, funded by the BBSRC, to
work in the Laboratory of Molecular and Evolutionary
Parasitology of Dr. Anastasios Tsaousis. The aims of
the research are to exploit the anaerobic adaptations of
the mitochondrion- related organelles of Blastocystis.
Project: Blastocystis is a human intestinal parasite,
recently considered to be a stramenopile, with a contro-
versial pathogenicity, mainly because of lack of knowl-
edge around its life cycle and function of its organelles.
Since Blastocystis is a strict anaerobe, it was thought
that lacked of canonical mitochondria, and instead it
had hydrogenosomes, anaerobic organelles related to
mitochondria. Recent genomic and transcriptomic data
generated from Blastocystis demonstrated the presence
of 700 putative mitochondrial and hydrogenosomal pro-
teins. Amongst these only a few so far have been shown
to localise into the organelles. The organelles are pre-
dicted to have additional mitochondrial characteristics,
including pathways for amino acid metabolism, pyruvate
metabolism and an incomplete tricarboxylic acid cy-
cle. The Blastocystis mitochondrion-related organelles
(MROs) have metabolic properties that are found in aer-
obic and anaerobic mitochondria but also in hydrogeno-
somes. The purpose of this project is to understand
the evolutionary adaptations of Blastocystis and es-
pecially its mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs)
under dierent environmental conditions. This work will
identify the signicance of the evolutionary important
of mitochondrion-related organelles for the organism,
but in addition will discover novel functions that can
potentially be used in systems biology, or targeting par-
asitic and even mitochondrial diseases. The project will
involve purifying the MROs under dierent environmen-
tal conditions, followed by proteomic and biochemical
analyses of the dierent novel pathways.
The successful candidate will have a PhD degree in
molecular biology/ biochemistry or the related disci-pline with experience in molecular parasitology and
cell culturing of parasites. Experience in mitochondrial
biochemistry, good interpersonal skills and ability to
communicate technical information is essential.
Closing date for applications is March 01, 2015.

Postdoc position in Molecular Ecology and Evolution
at Lund University, Sweden
Research Topic: Sexual Selection and Introgression in
Lizards
Background
Gene transfer between species or sub-species via hy-
bridization is increasingly recognized as an important
source of diversication and adaptation. However, only
rarely are systems suciently well understood to pre-
dict the degree and direction of hybridization, which
makes current studies largely exploratory and reliant
on post-hoc explanations. To circumvent this problem
we have experimentally established the causes of hy-
bridization between two sub-species of the common wall
lizard, Podarcis muralis. These studies suggest that in-
trogression in secondary contact will be driven by sexual
selection, with a number of predictions regarding the
direction, extent, and phenotypic and genomic patterns
of introgression. We now wish to test these predictions
in independent regions of hybridization using exten-
sive phenotypic data and generation of genome-wide
nucleotide markers that can be mapped onto the draft
genome of the species.
Job assignment
The tasks involve (i) Planning research; (ii) Generating,
processing and analyzing data on single nucleotide poly-
morphism; (iii) performing analyses to establish genomic
and geographic patterns of introgression using sequence
and phenotypic data; (iv) eld work to collect further
samples; and (v) preparation of results for publication.
The successful applicant is expected to contribute to the
intellectual environment of the host group through active
participation in discussion groups, meetings, and otheractivities. We encourage maintaining and establishing
new collaborations. Co-supervision of MSc students
may be part of the assignment. The position is funded
by a grant from the Swedish Research Council to Dr To-
bias Uller (http://www.biology.lu.se/tobias-uller) and is
initially for two years, with the possibility of a one-year
extension.
Eligibility/ Entry requirements
The applicant must have a PhD in Molecular Ecology,
Evolution or associated elds and have extensive expe-
rience with analyses of high-throughput sequence data.
A background in the application of genome data to non-
model organisms is highly meritorious. Applicants must
be highly motivated to pursue research in ecology and
evolution, show outstanding organizational skills, and
have a track record of completed research projects.
Basis for assessment
Applicants are evaluated based on documented ability
to develop and carry out high-quality research. Such
evidence may include a strong track record of publica-
tions in scientic journals, documentation of successful
completion of research projects, high intellectual capac-
ity and problem-solving ability, technical and analytical
know-how, organizational skills, enthusiasm, dedication,
and an ability to work both independently and in a team.
Where possible, statements to these eects should be
accompanied by objective or independent assessment
of the candidate's track record and potential (e.g., via
letters of support).

UMinnesota PlantMicrobeEvolution
We seek two postdoctoral research associates to join
us in a project on the evolution of plant and micro-
bial species in Minnesota prairies under climate change.
Postdocs will investigate the capacity of plant-microbe
associations to adapt or acclimate to rapidly changing
environment, and to evaluate the current geographic
scale of local adaptation. We anticipate that one post-
doc will focus on plant genetic variation and questions
of local adaptation and adaptive capacity, while the
second will focus on plant-associated microbial commu-
nities and the potential for microbes to either constrain
or accelerate adaptation of plant hosts to changing en-
vironment. Postdocs in these positions will be working
with a collaborative group of faculty (PI: Ruth Shaw,
co-PIs Georgiana May, Donald Wyse), graduate and
undergraduate students as well as volunteers. Training
opportunities include teaching in graduate seminars, de-
veloping citizen-science programs, conservation planning,
or interaction with governmental and non-governmental
agencies. To apply, please submit a cover letter of ap-
plication, CV, and names and contact information for
three references.

ining functional, population genetic and ecophysiological
mechanisms underlying success of polyploid plants.
The work aims to predict the eect of whole genome
duplication on ecological and evolutionary responses to
environmental change. The postdoc will identify the
ecological, population genetic and genomic factors that
underlie functional trait (e.g., associated with drought
and freeze tolerance) variation, ecological amplitude
and gene expression diversity using the wild strawberry
(Fragaria) as a model system (see Liston et al 2014.
AJB101:1686-1699; Johnson et al 2014 Bot J Linn Soc
176:99-114). The specic goals are to 1) analyze gene
expression (transcriptomes) and physiological traits of
natural and synthetic polyploids and their diploid pro-
genitors in the greenhouse and common gardens at cli-
matically diverse sites, 2) use NGS of target-captured
sequence from natural populations of plants to identify
patterns of genetic diversity and signatures of selection,
reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and generate high
density linkage maps (Tennesson et al 2014 GBE 6:3295-
331 3).
Responsibilities include the establishment and moni-
toring of experiments in the eld and under controlled
conditions in the lab, collection and analysis of popu-
lation genetic/genomic, phenotypic and physiological
data, and the preparation of manuscripts for publica-
tion. The project aords opportunities for international
travel and training as part of an US-China international
research collaboration. There is also the opportunity to
design and implement additional allied projects tailored
to the skills and interests of the postdoc.We are looking for an evolutionary-minded candidate
with a genomics, ecophysiological and/or population
ecology background interested in a combination of eld
work and genomic work. Candidates that have demon-
strated experience in transcriptome analysis, genetic
linkage mapping, and/or population and comparative
genomics are preferred. Ability to travel between eld
sites in Oregon and laboratory in Pennsylvania is re-
quired.
The postdoc position is for two years, renewable up to
two additional years. Start date is negotiable, but June
2015 is preferred.
The project is collaboration among the labs of Dr. Tia-
Lynn Ashman, Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Aaron Liston, Depart-
ment of Botany and Plant Pathology, and Dr. Richard
Cronn US Forest Service at Oregon State University.

UZurich GeneticsMaternalEects
Postdoc position in Evolutionary Genetics of Maternal
Eects University of Zurich, Switzerland
My group combines complementary approaches
from evolutionary ecology, ecophysiology and genet-
ics/genomics to understand the evolution and evolu-
tionary consequences of prenatal maternal eects in
dierent bird systems. Within this project, I have a
postdoc position available to investigate the genetic ba-
sis of prenatal maternal investment using established,
replicated Japanese quail selection lines for high and
low maternal egg investment.
Goal of the project is to identify genomic regions as-
sociated with dierential maternal investment, and to
link DNA sequence variation with the physiological and
ecological phenotype of mothers from high and low in-
vestment lines. Thereby this project can provide an
integrative understanding of the molecular and physi-
ological architecture underlying variation in maternal
reproductive strategies.
The ideal candidate for this position has a strong in-
terest in evolutionary biology, a can-do attitude and
good writing and organisational skills. Given the large
amount of data and the nature of the analyses involved
(e.g. handling of SNP data, QTL mapping), expertise
in evolutionary genetics, quantitative genetics, and/or
bioinformatics is essential.
The postdoc will be based at the Institute of Evo-
lutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of the
University of Zurich, providing ample opportunities
for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary elds (http:/-/www.ieu.uzh.ch). The institute is very international
and the working language is English.
The position is funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation for the duration of 18 months (gross salary
CHF / Euro 94'000 per annum). The ideal starting date
is May 1st 2015, or as soon as possible afterwards.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlin-
ing your motivation to work on this project, as well
as relevant experience, 2) a detailed curriculum vi-
tae, and 3) the contact details of three academic ref-
erees. Send the above as a single .pdf le to bar-

Two Postdoctoral Positions Available at the Caccone
Lab at Yale University
The Caccone laboratory associated with the Yale In-
stitute for Biospheric Studies (YIBS), the department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and the
School of Public Health (EPH) invites applications for
two post-doctoral positions.
The rst position involves supporting the Center for Sys-
tematics and Conservation Genetics within the YIBS
Institute. This center mission is to support research
and education in evolutionary and ecological genetics
at Yale University. Thus, the optimal candidate should
have a strong collaborative personality and like to train
undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of
DNA based techniques. The postdoc will be involved in
several research projects carried out within this YIBS
center. One long-running project is on Giant Galapa-
gos tortoises evolutionary, ecological, and conservation
genetics. One project key to this position is using ge-
nomic tools to identify hybrid tortoises with ancestry
in extinct species using hybrid capture approaches and
high-throughput sequencing. There are several other
large genomic datasets available and extensive samples144 EvolDir February 1, 2015
from across the Galapagos tortoise radiation provid-
ing scope for the postdoc to develop evolutionary and
population genomic projects with these and additional
data in line with their independent interests. Interest
in applying genomictools to conservation questions is
essential, as is experience with both the lab work and
bioinformatic analysis of large genomic-scale datasets for
population genetic/genomic questions. Field work expe-
rience is also preferred, but not required. The preferred
start date for this position is 1st April 2015.
The second position is funded by an NIH based program
project with the overall goal of understanding the trans-
mission epidemiology of tsetse transmitted diseases in
East Africa. This particularposition involves studying
the population genetics and genomics of tsetse ies in
East Africa (Glossina fuscipes and Glossina pallidipes)
to assess their population structure to aid in their mon-
itoring and control. The project involve collecting and
analyzing microsatellite and SNP markers to understand
patterns and levels of genetic diversity, as well as under-
stand the possible drivers that are shaping the observed
patterns. This will also include analysis of environmen-
tal and microbial (Wolbachia and others components of
the microbial community) data. The optimal candidate
should have previous experience in analyzing population
genetic data (DNA sequence and microsatellites), prefer-
ably have worked with environmental data, be familiar
with population genomic analyses, and in general have
some bioinformatics expertise to be able to analyze large
datasets. This project is part of a long-term collabora-
tion with Dr Aksoy (Yale School of Public Health) and
several scientists and Institutions in East Africa. As this
project has a strong eld component, the postdoc will be
expected to participate in the eld-based activities and
be involved in its coordination and progress. We study
the tsetse y (Glossina sp.) to investigate the physio-
logical, molecular and genetic mechanisms that underlie
1) vector population structures in east-Africa (Uganda
and Kenya), 2) tsetse host-African trypanosome interac-
tions, 3) tsetse host-endosymbiotic bacteria interactions,
and 4) tsetses unique viviparous reproductive biology.
The genome sequence of tsetse and all of its associated
microbial partners are now available, making the system
highly tractable. The position is available immediately.
Yale University oers exciting opportunities for aca-
demic achievement and professional growth. New Haven,
which is conveniently located between Boston and New
York City, is a dynamic city with cultural resources that
include world-renowned museums, theatres,concert halls
and ne dining establishments.
Salary and benets are according to Yale and NIH guide-
lines. Candidates should provide their CV and a short
research interest statement to Adalgisa Caccone (Adal-gisa.Caccone@yale.edu).

[FINAL NOTICE]
UC Davis
WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGENETICS
at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, California
March 7V14, 2015
Sponsored by the
University of California, Davis and Bodega Marine Lab-
oratory
http://treethinkers.org Introduction Phylogenetic meth-
ods have revolutionized modern systematics and become
indispensable tools in evolution, ecology and compar-
ative biology, playing an increasingly important role
in analyses of biological data at levels of organization
ranging from molecules to ecological communities. The
estimation of phylogenetic trees is now a formalized sta-
tistical problem with general agreement on the central
issues and questions. A nearly standard set of topics is
now taught as part of the curriculum at many colleges
and universities. On the other hand, application of
phylogenetic methods to novel problems outside system-
atics is an area of special excitement, innovation, and
controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
This Spring, for the sixteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a wide range of topics in comparative phy-
logenetics. The course starts with recent advances in
phylogenetic inference, and then focuses on methods for
making inferences from phylogenies.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the Northern California coast, which has on-site
housing. The course format will involve equal parts of
lecture, discussion, and hands-on software training. One
afternoon during the week will be left free for eld trips
to local natural areas.
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesianinference of phylogeny * Model specication issues:
model selection, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing
MCMC performance * Divergence-time estimation: re-
laxed clocks, fossil calibration * Species-tree estimation
* Character evolution: ancestral-state estimation, rates
of trait evolution * Lineage diversication: detecting
rate shifts, testing key innovation hypotheses
Instructors for the 2015 workshop * Jonathan Eisen *
Rich Glor * Tracy Heath * Sebastian Hohna * John
Huelsenbeck * Michael Landis * Sarah Longo * Mike
May * Brian Moore * Samantha Price * Bruce Rannala
* Bob Thomson * Peter Wainwright
Prerequisites Available housing limits course enrollment
to~30 students. Preference is given to doctoral candi-
dates who are in the early to middle stages of their thesis
research, and who have completed sucient prerequisites
(through previous coursework or research experience)
to provide some familiarity with phylogenetic methods.
Unfortunately, because of limits on class size, postdocs
and faculty are discouraged from applying.
Admission and Fees Students will be admitted based on
academic qualications and appropriateness of research
interests. The course fee is $750. This includes room
and board at BML for duration of the course (arriving
March 7, leaving March 14) and return transportation
from Davis to the Bodega Marine Labs.
Application Deadline Applications are due by January
10, 2015. Please send a completed application form and
one letter of recommendation from your major advi-
sor. Applications should be sent via email as PDFs to

Erasmus+ Master Program in Evolutionary Biology
(MEME)148 EvolDir February 1, 2015
MEME is a two-year research oriented master program
for talented and motivated students who are interested
in understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four European
universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands; Uni-
versity of Montpellier II, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,
Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA). Together, this consortium has put together an
attractive multidisciplinary program that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at (at least)
two partner universities, and they will receive a double
degree from two partner universities they have attended.
Being nanced by the European Community, MEME
has to satisfy the high quality standards imposed the
prestigious Erasmus+ Program. A limited number of full
scholarships is available for European and non-European
students and these will be awarded in a selective pro-
cedure. Details on the program and the selection pro-
cedure can be found on www.evobio.eu . Starting date:
15 August 2015 Application deadline: 1 February 2015

Invertebrates comprise over 95% of all animal species
and are grouped into ~35 distinct phyla, yet only
very limited genomic and transcriptomic data are cur-
rently available and primarily focus on a few model
species. GIGA will target 7,000 non-insect/non-
nematode species, with an emphasis on marine taxa
because of the unrivaled phyletic diversity in the oceans.
Target species will be selected based on their phyloge-
netic placement, relevance to organismal, ecological, and
conservation research and their importance to sheries
and human health.
The GIGA initiative has gained momentum after an
inaugural workshop at Nova Southeastern University in
March 2013, resulting in the joint publication of a white
paper ( <http://m.jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/-
105/1/1.full >). Recently GIGA held a symposium with
a broad audience at the 2014 Annual meeting of the
Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution in San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
The *2 ^nd *Global Invertebrate Genomics Alliance
(GIGA) workshop** will now take place from the 22.-
24. March 2015 at the Department of Earth and En-
vironmental Sciences, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at
M unchen, Germany.
We believe that this second GIGA will be vital to
keep the GIGA community and goals on track. We
would greatly appreciate your attendance as your in-
sight and experience will assist the further development
and progress of the GIGA community.
Due to generous support by the German Research Foun-
dation (DFG) we were able to assemble an excellent
set of invited speakers ( <http://bit.ly/1BSbl6f >) andFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 151
keep registration costs low (100 Euros).
Attendance is currently limited to 75 participants to
keep the workshop at a manageable size. A few seats
are still available.
Registration is now open through the GIGA II workshop
website <http://www.palmuc.de/GIGAII >.
Remaining seats will be given on a rst-come, rst-serve
basis with respect to payment of the registration fees.

The following course will take place at SCENE (Scot-
tish Center for Ecology and the Natural Environment),
Glasgow, United Kingdom. in from August 11th - 13th
2015 - An introduction to using GIS in ecological eld
studies
GIS is an important tool that can be used to incorporate
environmental and biological data to help look for pat-
terns or causes in the spatial distribution of organisms.
This course would most likely suite evolutionary biolo-
gists that study how the environment may inuence how
populations behave or distribute themselves in response
to environmental drivers such as habitat type, precipi-
tation, temperature, altitude etc and is most suitable
to people in the eld of ecological speciation, sympatric
divergence or adaptive radiation etc.
This course is aimed at biologists and ecologists who
are just starting to use GIS in their ecological data col-
lection and analysis and who have little or no existing
knowledge of this subject area.
There are only 12 places available in total and last time
this course lled very quickly!
For further details or questions please email oliver-
hooker@prstatistics.co.uk or visit www.prstatistics.co.uk
Course details: The course will consist of a mix of back-
ground talks, practical sessions based around ArcGIS
software and eld sessions conducted in the local oak
woodland. The eld sessions will provide experience in
how to collect data in a manner that is GIS-compatible.
The course will cover areas such as making a map for a
paper or a report, extracting information from Google
Earth for use in a GIS project, collecting GIS-compatible
data using a GPS receiver, transferring data between
a GPS and a GIS project, creating raster data layers

Swiss Alps EvolutionaryBiology
June19-25
Evolutionary Biology Workshop in the Alps
19-25 June 2015, Riederalp, Switzerland
Application Deadline: February 15.
Target participants: PhD students, advanced Master
students
The main goals of this annual workshop, based on a con-
cept developed by Stephen Stearns and John Maynard
Smith, are to develop the following skills: - developing
your scientic ideas through discussions in groups; -
thinking critically and expressing oneself clearly; - turn-
ing a general idea into a research project; - writing a
research proposal and defending it.
Faculty: Judith Mank (University College London)
Andrew Read (Pennsylvania State University) Tanja
Schwander (University of Lausanne) John Pannell (Uni-
versity of Lausanne) Tadeusz Kawecki (University of
Lausanne)
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back
seat. Additionally, the faculty will give talks about their
research and be available for informal discussion with
individual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in Villa Cassel (http://-www.pronatura-aletsch.ch/home-en), at 2000 m of al-
titude, a >100 year old villa where Winston Churchill
once stayed, amid the magnicent mountain landscape
of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, walking distance
from the largest glacier of the Alps. This isolated site
will help you to concentrate on the course while giving
you also the chance to enjoy the views and the alpine
ora.
Costs: CHF 530.- for room and board. 3 ETSC credit
points

ConsGenomics Mar22-27
Each year, the La Kretz Center sponsors this hands-on
workshop, held jointly at our Field Station and Stunt
Ranch. Our goal is to provide training and access to
the most current issues and techniques in population
genomics, and how these tools can be applied to pressing
conservation problems.
Conservation biology and genetics have had a long and
intimate relationship, and constitute one of the key
applications of evolutionary analysis to real-world bio-
logical problems. The impacts of population genetics,
phylogenetics and phylogeography have been particu-
larly striking for conservation biology, and have helped
solve some of the most pressing problems in biological
conservation. As the eld of landscape-based genetics
continues to grow and mature, the increasing availability
of genomic-level data, analytical models and methods
stand to make profound new contributions to our ability
to identify and protect at-risk populations and recover
those that are most endangered. However, genomic level
analyses also carry a heavy burden\data sets are enor-
mous, often requiring diverse computational approaches
for assembly, quality control and analysis.
This annual workshop will provide a comfortable, infor-
mal training environment for a small group of motivated
graduate students to explore how conservation problems
can best be addressed with genomic-level data. Our
goal is to provide hands-on experience on the ecient
collection, troubleshooting, and analysis of large data
sets for conservation-relevant problems. One of the
highlights of our workshop is active participation from
members of several US government agencies who are
at the forefront of endangered species protection and
management, providing a forum for exploring the most
relevant aspects of conservation genomics to managers.
The UCLA/La Kretz workshop will be held
at the La Kretz Field Station ( http://-
www.environment.ucla.edu/lakretz/eldstation/)
and Stunt Ranch Reserve (http://stuntranch.ucnrs.org)
in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. Only 30
miles from UCLA (and LAX airport), but nestled in
the relatively undeveloped 160,000 acre Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area, the Field Station
provides an ideal location that brings exciting newdevelopments in genomic science and pressing needs
in conservation and management together in a single
setting.
Our current instructor list, drawn from UCLA faculty
and several other southern California partners, includes:
Jonathon Chang Ben Fitzpatrick Paul Gugger Kirk
Lohmueller Evan McCartney-Melstad Mark Phuong Pe-
ter Ralph Brad Shaer Victoria Sork Phil Spinks Bob

eration platforms: the best tool for the job Data man-
agement pipelines: Quality Control Data storage Data
organization Data types and analyses: SNPs Sequences
Exploring very large data sets Functional genomic data
Genomic data and GIS Visualizing geographic structure
and demographic history Conservation phylogenomics
Prerequisites
Available housing limits course enrollment to ~20 stu-
dents. Preference is given to doctoral candidates who are
in the early to middle stages of their thesis research, and
who have completed sucient prerequisites (through pre-
vious coursework or research experience) to have some
familiarity with using a command line interface or pro-
gramming languages (i.e. Perl, python etc.). Postdocs,
faculty, and government researchers may also apply, but
preference will be given to graduate students.
Admission and Fees
Applicants will be admitted based on academic quali-
cations and appropriateness of research interests. The
course fee is $425. This includes food and lodging at the
La Kretz Field Station, as well as any incidental fees,
for the duration of the course (arriving Sunday March
22, departing Friday March 27). In addition, course
participants who would like to extend their stay at the
eld station for the remainder of the weekend may do
so for no extra charge. For those opting to stay the
weekend, departure time will be by 5:00 pm on Sunday
March 29.

Mar17-Apr2
Course on Programming for Evolutionary Biology
When: March 17th - April 2nd 2015
Location: Leipzig, Germany
Application deadline: January 15th 2015
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ \Nothing in
Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"
(Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolutionary biology often
involves the analysis of an unprecedented amount of
information and supports many other disciplines, such
as medicine (evolutionary medicine), behavioral biol-
ogy (evolutionary psychology), ecology, and information
transfer. Scientists have to analyze large datasets, whichrequires computational programming skills to design and
apply own ideas into customized algorithms.
In this intensive 17 days course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on experi-
ence in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the eld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a
focus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
\learning by doing", which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as nal projects in small
groups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs of
evolutionary biology or related research elds with no
or little programming experience who want to become
procient in computational evolutionary biology in a
couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the University of Leipzig.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoralFebruary 1, 2015 EvolDir 159
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
