Online Adaptation Dec8
Hi all,
At the nal CIGENE seminar of 2021, Felicity Jones,
Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, will
present:
Finding the mutations and molecular mechanisms un-
derlying adaptation in naturally evolving populations.Abstract: The genome contains an organism's complete
set of instructions for development, survival and repro-
duction. \Decoding" these instructions remains one
of the biggest challenges in biology with enormous im-
plications for medicine, agriculture, and conservation.
Leveraging the unique advantages of the threespine stick-
leback sh system, I'll describe the approaches we've
been using to identify the molecular basis and com-
mon molecular mechanisms underlying gene regulation,
trait variation, physiological and disease phenotypes
and survival in dierent marine and freshwater envi-
ronments. Combining diverse genomic, transcriptomic
and epigenomic datasets I'll discuss the importance of
cis-regulation of the non-coding regulatory genome as
mechanisms underlying divergent adaptation to dierent
habitats.
Time: Wednesday, December 8th, 12:00-13:00 CET -

AmphibianDiseaseEvolution
We are seeking a PhD student to work at the inter-
face of amphibian disease ecology, microbiology, and
evolutionary ecology.
The lab of Dr. Amy Ellison is oering a PhD studentship
to study Chytrid infection dynamics in the poison frog,
Dendrobates tinctorius. This is an exciting opportunity
to work as part of an international team to explore
and develop interests and expertise in the dynamics of
amphibian disease.
Application deadline: 12 Jan 2022
Project description: Infectious diseases have long been
known to be inuenced by the biotic, abiotic, and ge-
netic 'environments' under which they occur. Recently,
the microbial community that lives within and on an
individual has been shown to aect susceptibility to dis-
ease. However, because microbiomes are dynamic and
aected by both the ecology and genetics of their host,
a central goal in disease ecology is to understand how
the environment interacts with an organism's ecology
and evolutionary history to aect both their microbiome
and disease susceptibility.
In this project, based at Bangor University and in col-
laboration with the Smithsonian National Zoo and Con-
servation Biology Institute (USA), the student will use
a combination of laboratory animal experiments, eld-
work and molecular approaches to investigate the links
between ecology, evolution, and the microbiome of the
dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) on suscepti-
bility to the fungal skin pathogen Batrachochytrium den-
drobatidis (Bd), considered one of the greatest threats
to vertebrate biodiversity around the world.
The project oers a wealth of opportunities for the
student to gain experience in molecular biology, evo-
lutionary genetics, microbiology, disease ecology and
science communication. The studentship will be based
within the Molecular Ecology and Evolution group
(meeb.bangor.ac.uk), a world leader in the analyses of
molecular data addressing global issues in disease biol-
ogy and evolutionary genomics. It oers a dynamic and
supportive training environment for young scientists.
There will be opportunities for the student to work and
train with US collaborators and perform international
eldwork (South America) during the project.
Location: The studentship will be held at Bangor Uni-
versity, in Northwest Wales, with opportunities to visitproject partners in the USA and conduct eldwork at
locations in South America. The Molecular Ecology
and Evolution group at Bangor (MEEB) is an interna-
tionally leading research group that focuses on under-
standing the diversity and function of both micro- and
macro-organisms, including plants, microorganisms and
animals throughout terrestrial, aquatic and aerobiolog-
ical biomes. A central part of our work involves the
application of genetics, genomics, transcriptomics and
other high-throughput molecular techniques to address
fundamental evolutionary and ecological questions re-
lating to the origins, levels, distribution and ecological
signicance of genetic variation. In MEEB we comple-
ment molecular genetic data with detailed ecological,
behavioural, physiological, microbiological and environ-
mental data to understand the underlying causes of
individual, population or species diversity in time and
space.
Funding details. - The competitive studentship is fully
funded for 3.5-year. - A tax-free stipend is paid at the
standard ^AUKRI rate; pounds 15,609 in 2021/22. - All
university fees are paid. - A Research and Training
Grant of pounds 8,750 is provided to fund research, con-
ference attendance and networking. Opportunities to
bid for additional funding are available. - All Envision
projects can be undertaken on either a Full Time or
Part Time (minimum of 0.5 FTE) basis.

I am seeking applicants for a competitively funded
PhD program as part of my new research group
at Bangor University in Wales, UK. The success-
ful applicant will be put forward for funding from
the Envision Doctoral Training Program (NERC-
funded). More details: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/-
lec/research/envision/ *About the Project:* Environ-
mental change is causing temperatures to rise across the
globe - how this will aect the distribution and abun-
dance of species is therefore an important current focus
for ecologists worldwide. An under recognised aspect
of climate change is increased overwinter temperatures.
While research has focused largely on the impacts of
hot periods (i.e. summer) getting hotter, winter tem-
peratures have in fact been rising at a faster rate than
summer temperatures over the last century. Ectother-
mic species such as reptiles are especially vulnerable
to projected thermal shifts given their physiological
reliance on ambient temperatures. However, reptile re-
sponses to climate shifts have received little attention,
and existing work has been heavily biased towards the
summer active season. Reptiles at temperate latitudes
often rely on a temperature-sensitive winter hibernation
period. Evidence suggests that milder winters could
disrupt hibernation, with lasting carryover eects on
phenology, breeding success, and tolerance to stressors.
Nevertheless, due to the scarcity of data, how reptiles
in temperate regions such as the United Kingdom will
respond to rising winter temperatures remains unknown.
The student will conduct laboratory-based experiments
using an invasive lizard in the UK, the wall lizard (Po-
darcis muralis), in conjunction with wild population
monitoring, and collation and analysis of long-term
data, to investigate: (1) how increased overwinter tem-
peratures aect wall lizard reproductive success, and
hormonal and behavioural responses to stress in captive
and wild populations, and (2) how historical patterns
of winter-warming have inuenced the distribution and
phenology of British reptiles to date. This project will
involve eld and lab-based work, as well as the assembly
of novel and exciting datasets from public records. The
Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust will serve
as a CASE partner and will provide further training
opportunities.
*Eligibility:* Applicants should hold a minimum of aUK Honours Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in sub-
jects such as Zoology, Animal Behaviour, Conservation
Science, or Biology. Past eld or laboratory research
experience is an advantage but will not be used as an
exclusion criteria for shortlisting. International appli-
cants welcome - top-up fees will be waived (i.e. funding
will cover all international fees).

The Institute of Avian Research \Vogelwarte Helgoland"
is a non-university research institute in the portfolio of
the Lower Saxonian Ministry of Science and Cultural
Aairs. The Institute members conduct fundamental
research on the complex relationships between birds
and their environments. The central research foci are
bird migration and life history biology. In addition, the
Institute houses the Bird Ringing Centre for Northwest
Germany.
We are searching for a PhD student (3 years, salary level
TV-L E13, 65%)
The successful candidate will work in the team of Prof.
Dr. Miriam Liedvogel, and be jointly supervised by
Dr. Oscar Vedder (Institute of Avian Research) and
Dr. Pablo Salm?n (University of Glasgow and Univer-
sity of the Basque Country), and investigate causes and
consequences of among- and within-individual variation
in mitochondrial function in a captive population of
Japanese quail.
The Institute houses a large captive population of
Japanese quail with a detailed pedigree. The quail
are an excellent model species to investigates causes
and consequences of mitochondrial function, because
they mate indiscriminately (allowing specic breeding
designs), mature rapidly (allowing multi-generational
sampling), have a relatively short lifespan (allowing
estimation of lifetime performance), and their develop-
ment rate and reproductive rate can be easily quantied
and manipulated. Potential research avenues that can
be pursued are the inheritance of mitochondrial traits,
inbreeding depression and ageing in mitochondrial func-
tion, and their potential to predict individual tness,
but research questions are not xed and can be tailored
to the specic interest of the student.
The main responsibilities of the student will be to:
- Design and carry out (breeding) experiments and col-
lect blood samples, using the quail as a model species. -
Analyse collected samples for mitochondrial function. -
Run statistical analyses on the collected data. - Publish
papers in peer-reviewed scientic journals as a rst and
co-author. - Present the work at national and interna-
tional conferences.
We therefore seek an enthusiastic and dedicated studentJanuary 1, 2022 EvolDir 9

NERC GW4+ DTP Studentship - Impact of toxic metal
contamination on freshwater snails in the Kruger Na-
tional Park (South Africa) using an ecogenomics ap-
proach Project keywords: Metal pollution, freshwa-
ter snails, bioindicator species, genomics, epigenetics
Project Background
South Africa is naturally water-scarce with annual rain-
fall half the global average. Recent years of below-
average rainfall have already put tremendous pressure
on wildlife and human populations in the region. The
demand for water is predicted to outstrip supply by
2025 and therefore, to safeguard this resource for future
generations, evidence needs to be generated to inform
adequate legal protection for strategic water resources.
Toxic metals are naturally present in the environment
but due to anthropogenic activities, such as mining andagriculture, can become biologically available and reach
toxic levels. This poses serious threats to human and
wildlife health via drinking water and food chain bio-
magnication. Nevertheless, mining has been one of the
main economic drivers in South Africa. The country
has the world's fth-largest mining sector in terms of
GDP and is the world's largest producer of manganese,
chrome, and platinum-group metals. However, all this
mining activity leads to polluted river systems with an
obvious environmental cost. Project Aims and Methods
This project will be conducted in the iconic Kruger Na-
tional Park, South Africa and the overall aim of the
project will be to investigate the eects of toxic metal
contamination in freshwater ecosystems. This project
will provide essential data on downstream freshwater
pollution for future mitigation measures which has the
potential to benet South Africa and other southern
African countries with similar challenges. This will
contribute to the improvement of human and wildlife
health and the provision of potable water. A series of
techniques including chemical analysis, DNA barcoding,
whole-genome sequencing and ecological experiments
under laboratory conditions will be utilised to address
the overall project aim. The project will consist of four
Work Packages (WPs). In brief, WP aims will include:
chemical characterisation of water and snail (bioindica-
tor species) tissue samples *(WP1)*, the assessment of
freshwater snail taxonomic/genetic diversity and species
distributions *(WP2)*, the investigation of genomic pro-
les of freshwater snails (*Biomphalaria pfeieri*) across
polluted and pristine river systems and the ne-scale
population genetic structure of native *B.* *pfeieri*
*(WP3)* and the study of metal exposure in controlled
laboratory experiments* (WP4).* The supervisory team
encourage the co-creation of this proposed project by
the student to better match the interest of the student.
Candidate requirements
The successful candidate will demonstrate experience
in, and willingness to, undertake international eldwork,
specically in South Africa. A strong background in
ecology, population genetics or related molecular ap-
proaches and genome analyses (bioinformatics), is desir-
able, and/or experience in statistical analyses/modelling
or Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are required.
In addition, some experience with Big data is desirable.
The student will be based in Wales (UK) with eldwork
in South Africa and training in Portugal and Exeter
(UK). Project partners
*National Museum Wales. Training in freshwater snail
identications using a morphological approach.*
*SANParks. Provides logistics (guides, specic site ac-

PhD research in spruce quantitative genetics ??? Lake-
head University
Our research group is seeking a highly qualied PhD
student to undertake a four-year PhD research project
aimed at examining quantitative trait variation across
the natural range of black spruce (Picea mariana). Ap-
plicants should have completed a four-year undergrad-
uate degree in science or mathematics and should also
have completed a two-year research-based masters de-
gree (applicants currently enrolled in a masters thesis
program and that are near completion may also be
considered).The ideal candidate will possess a strong
background in population genetics and statistics.
The PhD student will undertake research to examine
patterns of quantitative trait variation and adaptation
to climate in black spruce (Picea mariana). Black spruce
has a transcontinental distribution in North America,
stretching from the Atlantic coast to Alaska, USA. Occu-
pying a diverse range of environmental conditions across
its natural range, black spruce possesses considerable
genetic variation in adaptive traits among its geographic
populations. We have previously collected growth and
survival data from range-wide black spruce provenance
trials located across Canada and the United States toinvestigate patterns of adaptive variation in relation to
climate in black spruce. The proposed PhD research is
intended to build on this past work by modeling the ge-
netic response surface of provenances to varying climate
at test sites and formulating the seed transfer functions
and optimal seed transfer guidance for forest renewal
sites using innovative approaches.
The graduate research project will be co-supervised by
Dr. Ashley Thomson, Assistant Professor (Forest Genet-
ics) Lakehead University, and Dr. Pengxin Lu, Forest
Research & Development Geneticist, Ontario Forest
Research Institute.
The intended start date is September 2022. Graduate re-
search funding in the amount of $15,000 per annum will
be provided for four years. In addition, the student will
receive (subject to eligibility) a graduate assistantship
valued at ~$13,000 per annum.

EMYS-R: A socio-ecological evaluation of wetlands
restoration and reintroduction programs in favor of the
emblematic European pond turtle and associated biodi-
versity: a pan-European approach
Project background: Over the last 3 decades, the EU
has funded numerous projects for wetland restoration
in favor of the European pond turtle. Yet the results of
these measures need to be more intensely promoted. A
key question remains unanswered: what are the most
eective wetland restoration methods suitable for sus-
tainable maintenance and recovery of the European
pond turtle and associated wildlife throughout Europe?
EMYS-R consolidates an existing international network
of researchers and stakeholders to share complemen-
tary knowledge on past, present and future wetlands,
biodiversity and their management. It is a 3-year partici-
patory action-oriented research project based on seminal
theories in humanities, social and natural sciences. It
aims at testing the hypothesis that higher degrees of
wetland restoration can compensate for limited capabil-
ities of captive bred turtles to settle in the wild, and
assess how specically such conservation actions benet
society by bringing together people and nature.
Your tasks:
The successful PhD candidate will be involved in the eco-
logical assessment of wetland restoration, turtle reintro-
duction and consequences on local biodiversity including
non-target species. While based in Frankfurt am Main,
Germany, the candidate will spend a substantial amount
of time at the German and French eld sites, and will
also be traveling to trainings and meetings in Poland
and Latvia, contributors of the EMYS-R consortium.
More specically, the successful candidate will conduct
the following tasks:
Data collection: behavioral (animal-borne data loggers
including GPS and time-depth-acceleration recorders),biometric/demographic (capture-mark-recapture proto-
cols) and ecological (water, sediment, turtle-centered
prey-predators feces samples) on the German study site
in Neuburg am Rhein eDNA Metabarcoding of envi-
ronmental (water and sediment) and ecological (turtle
prey-predator feces) samples bioinformatic analyses of
metabarcoding sequences for genomic biodiversity mon-
itoring and food web analyses Data analyses of existing
and formerly collected time series on turtle behavior,
biometry and demography Support and then lead eld
sessions in Neuburg am Rhein Support with public per-
ception seminars and workshops in Neuburg am Rhein
Literature review on German-written grey literature
about wetland renaturations and turtle reintroductions
Writing scientic publications, contributing to national
and international conferences, as well as to internal
reports and international guidelines
Your prole:
Master degree in Biology, Ecology, Environmental Sci-
ences, or equivalent Programming experience with ma-
nipulating large database (Metabarcoding sequences,
behavioral long time series) knowledge in R, MatLab
and Linux desirable Experience in the molecular genetic
lab Experience with Metabarcoding desirable Master-
ing multivariate statistics Interest in interdisciplinary
approaches Proven capabilities in implementing eld
protocols in remote places in autonomy and within a
team Able to team up within a large international con-
sortium Professional communication skills within the
scientic consortium, but also with local stakeholders
Fluent (speech and writing/reading) in German and

Two graduate assistantships (one PhD and one MS) are
available to work on epidemiology, population genetics,
and fungicide resistance of Cercospora leaf blight (CLB)
of soybean. The research projects are collaborative ef-
forts across the labs of Drs. Jonathan Richards, Vinson
Doyle, and Sara Thomas-Sharma, and will involve a
network of soybean researchers across the mid-South.
The PhD student will work on population biol-
ogy/genomics of Cercospora associated with CLB. This
project aims to understand population dynamics and
genomic signatures of host adaptation and fungicide
resistance evolution of CLB pathogens across the mid-
southern United States. This project would include
both eld and lab work. Field work will include sam-
pling from agricultural and non-agricultural habitats
and experimental eld plots. Lab/computational work
will include reference genome development (nanopore,
Pacbio sequencing), RNAseq, dierential gene expres-
sion analysis, demographic analysis, etc. The student
will also leverage population genomic data to design
assays for rapid screening of fungicide resistance (for
QoI, DMI, and SDHI fungicide chemistries) and identify
additional SNPs that might be associated with fungicide
resistance. Student skills gained at the end of project
period will thus include systematic sampling, working
with big data, assay development, among others.
The MS student will work on identifying spore peaks of
Cercospora spp. from spore trap data across the mid-
South. The student will use available quantitative PCR
detection methods to quantify spore peaks and identify
environmental variables associated with spore peaks.
Student will also have the opportunity to assist with co-
ordination of multi-state spore-trapping eorts and eld
experiments to target spore peaks. Student will thus
gain skills in setting up eld experiments, application
of detection tools, data analysis, etc.
Both students will be expected to participate in scien-

PhD Scholarship Inbreeding, mitochondrial performance
and senescence in birds (B045221)
Scholarship opportunities
We are looking for a student who wishes to design their
own PhD research project researching inbreeding ef-
fects on senescence and physiological mechanisms of
senescence. You will be supervised by Hannah Dugdale
(RUG; https://hannahdugdale.wordpress.com), Simon
Grith (MQ; https://grithecology.com), and David
S Richardson (University of East Anglia, UK, https://-
people.uea.ac.uk/david richardson).
This is a double degree at RUG and MQ. For the rst
two-years you will be based at RUG and embedded in the
Seychelles Warbler Project (http://seychelles-warbler-
project.group.shef.ac.uk). You will conduct eldwork
in the Seychelles for a minimum of two seasons (up to
3 months per season), with a COVID-19 contingency
plan. For the second two-years you will be based in
Australia on the MQ campus. You will be part of a
team of PhD students, post-docs, and sta who are
using long-term individual-based datasets of natural
and captive populations to improve understanding of
life-history evolution.
As a PhD scholarship student, you will develop your
own research project in consultation with the associated
supervisors. You will conduct independent and original
scientic research, report results via peer-reviewed publi-
cations, conference presentations, and ultimately a PhD
thesis. The PhD thesis has to be completed within four
years. Being part of a cutting-edge research programme,
you will receive training in the form of hands-on instruc-
tion, advanced courses, summer/winter schools, as well
as complementary workshops on generic research and
transferable skills. Special attention is paid to train-
ing activities directed towards your future (academic or
non-academic) career after the PhD trajectory, in the
context of the RUG's Career Perspective Series, and theResearch Training Certication Program at MQ.
Project One of the most profound challenges we all face
is our deterioration with age - a process known as senes-
cence. Individuals clearly senesce dierently, in both
the age they start to deteriorate and the rate of their
decline. However, the underlying causes of these dier-
ences in senescence patterns remain poorly understood.
Inbreeding increases the proportion of the genome that
is identical by descent, reducing genetic heterozygosity
and increasing the expression of deleterious recessive
alleles, thus reducing tness. Genomic markers provide
power to estimate heterozygosity and test the prediction
that inbreeding depression increases with age. Addition-
ally, improved understanding of the cellular physiology
of senescence will highlight potential mechanisms of
senescence. This will help clarify why some individuals
are less able to buer against senescence, perhaps, for
example, due to their genetic makeup or mitochondrial
performance.
You will design your project to investigate inbreeding
eects on senescence, and physiological senescence. In
the Netherlands, you will have the long-term Seychelles
warbler dataset available to address this question. Sey-
chelles warblers are cooperative breeders and we have
detailed life-history data of over 2,000 birds, spanning
more than 30 years. High variance in both senescence
and inbreeding occurs in the population. Over 450 birds
in our dataset are inbred, and inbreeding eects accumu-
late over life and impact strongly on survival. Potential
research questions are how genome-wide heterozygosity
aects senescence, and whether heterozygosity tness
correlations arise due to locus specic or genome-wide
eects. In Australia, you will work on the cellular phys-
iology of senescence using a captive population of long-
tailed nches. In this captive population we have a good
pedigree with known demography and use approaches
to measure mitochondrial performance non-invasively.
This component will provide insight into potential un-
derlying mechanisms of organismal senescence. The
overall project will improve our understanding of how
and why some individuals live longer, healthier lives,
and provide important insights into ways of mitigating
senescence.

UHull UK BeeGenomics
~~Fully funded PhD: Nutrigenomics and the resilience
of bees in a changing climate ~~
For details please contact Dr James Gilbert
(james.gilbert@hull.ac.uk). To apply, and for
more details: https://panorama-dtp.ac.uk/research/-

climate/ Deadline: 5 Jan 2022 Eligibility: UK, EU
and International: see further info here: https://-
panorama-dtp.ac.uk/how-to-apply/ Funding: UK
(NERC, Competition-funded; CASE partner)
A fully funded PhD position is now open for applications
at the Universities of Hull and Leeds, UK, via NERC's
Panorama Doctoral Tranining Partnership programme.
Bees, our foremost pollinators, are vital for ecosystem
stability and global food security - providing pollination
services worth hundreds of billions of pounds annually.
The UK is home to ~245 species of wild bees which
collectively perform more pollination than managed
honeybees and bumblebees. Unfortunately, wild bee
populations are declining, under pressure from multiple
causes - one key factor being nutrition.
All bees feed ospring with pollen gathered from the
landscape. But human inuences such as agricultural
intensication are altering nutritional landscapes for
bees [3,4], and fundamentally aecting gene expression,
growth and reproduction. Most of what we know about
bee nutrition comes from studies in social bees like hon-
eybees or bumblebees [5,6], where nutrition inuences
caste determination, development, pathogen resistance
and others. However, the nutritional ecology of other
bees, particularly solitary bees, is largely unstudied.
Human activity is also changing climates and raising
average temperatures. Temperature aects animals'
metabolic rate, physiology, digestion, and nutrient as-
similation, as well as gene expression. Dr Gilbert's
recent work [7] has identied the need to store enough
carbohydrate and fat to survive the winter as potentially
critical for solitary bees' nutritional ecology. But we
know little about how this is regulated, how climatechange will aect bees, and how bees will deal with
changing nutritional landscapes in a future lled with
uncertainty.
We are now, for the rst time, in a position to under-
stand not just whether but also how dierent nutritional
landscapes and climates aect bees. This exciting cross-
institutional project combines eld ecology with cutting
edge molecular approaches to address a crucial knowl-
edge gap about how bees are being aected by human-
altered nutritional landscapes. This project addresses
issues relevant for pure ecological science, conservation
biology, agriculture and crop science.
At Hull, Dr Gilbert's lab has pioneered rearing protocols
for the economically and ecologically important solitary
bee, Osmia bicornis. This work is providing an unprece-
dented window onto bee nutritional ecology. At Leeds,
Dr Duncan's lab uses a variety of cutting-edge molec-
ular tools to understand how bees are inuenced by
their environment. Dr Duncan has conducted ground-
breaking work on how nutrition aects gene expression
in developing bees, as well as recent work on the en-
vironmental and molecular control of reproduction in
O. bicornis. The student will capitalise on this timely
opportunity to synthesize the research interests of these
two research groups and create collaborative links be-
tween institutions. The candidate will be integrated into
both lab groups and will benet from the infrastructure
and connections at both universities.
Using careful manipulations within controlled labora-
tory environments, the student will rst establish how
dietary macronutrients aect the tness of solitary bee
larvae in response to changes in rearing temperature.
Then, they will use high-throughput sequencing tech-
nology to examine genome-wide expression proles of
larvae receiving dierent diet and temperature treat-
ments, to understand the molecular and physiological
mechanisms underlying bees' responses to landscape
and climate change. Nutritional cues are known to alter
gene expression [8], but to date studies have focussed
largely on a few genes, and only in honeybees. The
student will compare larvae receiving dierent treat-
ments in (1) choices larvae make about which nutrients
to consume, (2) correlates of tness such as body size
and overwinter survival, and (3) expression of growth-
versus diapause-related genes.
Outcomes: The ndings will, rstly, shed light on the
optimal nutrition for bees - both currently, and in a
warmer future. They will help inform active measures
such as wildower strips to conserve and promote these
vital pollinators as the climate changes. Secondly, re-
sults will also show the physiological eects of dierent

PhD project: **Ecological assembly processes: a pre-
dictive framework for fungal metacommunities** Main
supervisor: Nerea Abrego Application deadline: January
14, 2022
With our planet facing the so-called sixth mass extinc-
tion, there is an urgent need to mechanistically under-
stand the processes organizing biodiversity. A robust
fundamental understanding the forces shaping biodiver-
sity is the basis for any rational management of natural
resources. Reaching such understanding, is the core
aim of community ecology. Thus, much of the focus
of the empirical research in community ecology is on
measuring the roles of dierent assembly processes in
shaping ecological communities (i.e., measuring what
mechanisms determine what species occur where and
when). From earlier research, one thing is well known:
the habitat or abiotic environment has a huge inuence
on what species are found at a given location and time.
In other words, the role of environmental ltering as
a process shaping species communities is well known.
However, there are other less studied processes which
should also inuence species community composition, as
are the role of biotic interactions, dispersal and stochas-
tic processes. One of the reasons why the latter men-
tioned processes remain less studied is simply that they
are more challenging to study, requiring experimental
settings and study systems that conform to the assump-
tions of theoretical frameworks. In this project, we will
use wood-inhabiting fungal metacommunities in island
landscapes as the study system. One major advantage
of wood-inhabiting fungi as study systems is that they
are organized as spatially well-dened metacommunities,
thus conforming to the assumptions of many theoretical
frameworks. Another major advantage they allow for
experimental manipulations targeted to all community
assembly processes in a way that would not be possible
for almost any other species-rich community.
The work involved in this project includes eldwork for
collecting data and setting up experiments, preparation
of samples for DNA analyses, and application of sta-
tistical methods, importantly joint species distribution
modelling. Dr. Nerea Abrego will act as the main super-
visor and Prof. Otso Ovaskainen as the co-supervisor.
Abrego is an expert in theoretical and empirical com-
munity ecology and Ovaskainen in mathematical and20 EvolDir January 1, 2022

grated to a multidisciplinary research group focusing
broadly on community ecology, providing the opportu-

The candidate is expected to have, or is about to obtain,
a Master's degree in a relevant discipline.
I know the application process to the doctoral school
is laborious, but please consider applying if you are
interested in the project.About my group: My group studies evolutionary genet-
ics focusing on adaptation and mutation. Projects going
on in the lab include the role of epigenetic changes in
adaptation, mutations and their eects, parental eects
(in fungi) and their role in adaptation, quantitative ge-
netics of thermal performance, and adaptation in uctu-
ating environments. We use mainly fungal experimental
systems: the lamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, and
ssion yeast. Fungi are very good genetic model systems,
and with ssion yeast it is possible to do experimental
evolution. Sometimes we also use computer simulations
to investigate how evolution works. Otherwise we use
the methods and theory of population and quantitative
genetics.
More information about the lab can be found at: ikron-
holm.net
The project: Traditionally population genetics has been
concerned only with DNA sequence changes. However,
in recent years it has been revealed that certain epige-
netic modications, such as DNA methylation, can be
transmitted from one generation to the next in some
contexts, particularly in plants. The aim of this project
is to develop population genetic methods for the analysis
of methylation variation data. In particular, the goal
is to compare dierent methods of calculating diver-
gence in methylation patterns and examine how to use
methylation information in population genetic analyses.
Second goal is to investigate the patterns of DNA methy-
lation variation in the lamentous fungus Neurospora
crassa that is being collected in our group, and to test
hypotheses of about the role of methylation variation
in publicly available data from plants. There is also
some room to tailor the project according to interests of
the candidate. For example looking at dierent aspects
Neurospora population genetics such as recombination,
natural selection, particularly for structural variants.
The project will be mostly computational in nature,
and a successful candidate should have a strong inter-
est in population genetics and evolutionary biology. A
background in evolutionary biology, population genetics,

UKonstanz BirdSocialBehaviour
What makes groups successful?
The Griesser lab (Department of Biology & Centre for
the Advanced Study of Collective Behavior, University
of Konstanz) is looking for 1 PhD candidate to investi-
gate the consequences of the interplay between individ-
ual and group social phenotype in a wild bird species.
Individual tness is the currency of Darwinian evolution,
and largely depends on an individual's social phenotype
(e.g., cooperativeness, aggressivity, stress sensitivity).
However, in animals living in enduring social groups,
an individual's tness is also aected by the group's
social phenotype. Although the latter component is
rarely considered, it is potentially quite important: suc-
cessful groups should be better at coordinating their
behaviours, e.g., during foraging or predator encounters.
This PhD project will investigate these links in wild pop-
ulation of Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaustus) in Swedish
Lapland, monitored since 1989. Our study population is
located in both pristine and managed forests. This bird
species lives in stable, enduring groups composed of a
breeding pair and up to 4 non-breeders, and we follow
individuals in up to 90 groups throughout their life to
collect life-history data and standardized behavioural
data. Non-breeders dier largely in how well they are
integrated into the group. The PhD project will com-
bine eld experiments with existing long-term data to
investigate the interplay between individual and group
social phenotype, and its consequences. A short descrip-
tion of our past research can be found here: https://-
www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaH6wjAYAiE You will
join the Griesser lab and the interdisciplinary team at
the Excellence Cluster for the Advanced Study of Col-
lective Behaviour at the University of Konstanz, and
become a member of the IMPRS. The position can be-
gin April 2022 (latest 1st July 2022) and will be fullyfunded for three years (65%, salary scale 13 TV-L).
Requirements: -||| MSc in behavioural ecology, ecol-
ogy, evolutionary biology, or similar; -||| Field ex-
perience of behavioural observations and experimental
work; -||| Bird handling experience (including mist
netting); -||| Highly motivated and sociable per-
sonality; -||| Project management skills; -|||
Ability to work both independently and in a team; -||
| Driver's license (manual transmission); -||| Basic
knowledge of X-country or downhill skiing; -||| If

Ph.D. positions in ant social evolution and population
genomics, University of Lausanne
Two Ph.D. positions (graduate assistants) in evolution-
ary biology are available in the group of Prof. Michel
Chapuisat at the Department of Ecology and Evolution,
University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The successful
candidates will join a group studying the evolution and
genomic basis of social organization in ants (see http:/-
/www.unil.ch/dee/page7000.html).
1) The evolution of supercoloniality in ants
The objective of the Ph.D. will be to investigate the evo-22 EvolDir January 1, 2022
lution of supercoloniality in ants of the genus Formica.
In the Swiss Jura mountains, the native wood ant
Formica paralugubris forms large supercolonies, with
hundreds of nests connected by trails and hundreds of
queens in each nest. The evolution of such supercolonies
is still poorly understood. High-throughput sequenc-
ing and population genomic analyses will provide high-
resolution information on population structure, dispersal
patterns, symbionts, and genomic basis of colony traits
such as sex ratio. Comparative analyses will reveal if
the supergene controlling polymorphic social organiza-
tion in other Formica species has been xed or lost in
F. paralugubris, and if the same genes and alleles are
associated with high colony queen number across the
genus.
Your responsibilities: You will develop research on the
evolution of ant sociality and supercoloniality. This
will involve eld sampling, sequencing, population ge-
nomic and comparative genomic analyses. Depending
on your interests and skills, behavioural and ecological
experiments are also possible.
Your qualications: In order to complete our team, we
are looking for someone with a Master's degree in bi-
ology, life sciences, genetics, bioinformatics, or related
subjects. Applicants should have knowledge and skills
pertaining to evolutionary biology, population genetics,
molecular evolution and/or behavioural ecology. We are
looking for a creative and driven person with excellent
interpersonal skills.
Job information: Expected start date in position:
01.03.2022 (or at earliest convenience) Contract length:
The initial contract is for 1 year, renewable twice for
two years, up to a maximum of 5 years in total Activity
rate: 85% Workplace: Lausanne - Dorigny
What the position oers you: We oer a nice work-
ing place in a multicultural, diverse and dynamic aca-
demic environment, with opportunities for professional
training. The Department of Ecology and Evolution in
Lausanne University hosts research groups working on
a broad range of topics, producing a rich intellectual
and social life. The working language in the group and
in the Department is English for all scientic matters.
Good command of English is needed, some knowledge
of French would be a plus, but is not mandatory. The
University of Lausanne oers state-of-the-art facilities,
including excellent computer facilities and molecular
labs.
Contact for further information: Prof. Michel Chapuisat
: Michel.Chapuisat@unil.ch
Your application: Deadline: 15.01.2022 Incoming appli-
cations will continue to be considered until the positionis lled.
To apply, please upload a single pdf document con-
taining: a cover letter with a short description of your
research interests, research experience, and why you are
interested in joining our group; Your CV; The contact
details of 2-3 referees; A copy of your Master degree;
Your Master's thesis summary.
To receive full consideration, application documents
should be uploaded online through the University of
Lausanne recruitment platform. Please apply through
this webpage: https://bit.ly/3rRa0Ak 2) Selsh super-
gene in ants
The objective of the Ph.D. will be to investigate
the mechanisms by which a social supergene distorts
Mendelian transmission. In the Alpine silver ant,
Formica selysi, a large supergene controls colony so-
cial organization, and the haplotype associated with
multiple-queen colonies selshly distorts transmission
by killing progeny that did not inherit this haplotype. In
collaboration with the team, you will identify the selsh
genetic element and characterize the process causing
brood developmental arrest. The research will provide
insights into the role of selsh genetic elements in the
evolution of supergenes controlling complex phenotypes.
Your responsibilities: You will develop research on self-
ish genetic elements (toxin-antidote elements) present
in supergenes. This will involve eld sampling, breed-
ing experiments, molecular analyses (transcriptomics,
proteomics, RNAi), developmental studies, and genome
analyses.

ULethbridge InsectMicrobiome
We have an opening for a MSc student starting May
2022 to study the gut microbiome of carabid beetles
(Coleoptera: Carabidae).
About 400 species of carabid beetles form an abundant
and diverse assemblage in agricultural systems through-
out the Canadian Prairies. Most of these species are
considered benecial by virtue of being parasitoids or
predators of pest insects, or by feeding on weed seeds.
The taxonomy, distribution and life-history for most
of these beetles is well-known, and large numbers of
specimens can be readily collected with use of pitfall
traps. Because of these features, carabid beetles have
been extensively studied as biological indicators of envi-
ronmental change.
The gut microbiome of insects plays a critical role in the
breakdown and assimilation of food items by the host.
Factors that aect the microbiome (e.g., diet, chemicals
residues, temperature) can inuence the survival and
reproduction tness of the host and the ecosystem ser-
vices that they provide. Few studies have described the
gut microbiome of carabid species.
The proposed research will use next generation sequenc-
ing methods to compare the gut microbiome of selected
carabid species representing dierent trophic levels (e.g.,
parasitoid, predator, seed-feeder) under dierent con-
ditions such as diet, crop type (e.g., cereal, oilseed),
and exposure to agricultural chemicals (e.g., herbicides,
fungicides).
Knowledge and expertise on next generation sequenc-
ing methods, bioinformatics and microbial communities
is an asset. This project has broad applications for
research in water, soil, crop and livestock systems.

Role of gene regulation in the social control of queen
behavioral specialization in ants
Registration deadline: 20 January 2022 Application
deadline: 27 January 2022
The Libbrecht group at the Johannes Gutenberg Uni-
versity of Mainz (Germany) is oering a 3-year PhD
position (DFG, fully funded with possibility of exten-
sion, 65% TVL E13) to study the role of gene regulation
in the social control of queen behavioral specialization
in ants. The PhD student will be supervised by Romain
Libbrecht (JGU Mainz) in collaboration with Joe Col-
gan (JGU Mainz), Ren >1
2Ketting (IMB Mainz) and
Franjo Weissing (University of Groningen), and will be
integrated in the GenEvo research training program
(https://www.genevo-rtg.de/).
Division of labor between specialized castes is central
to the functioning and evolution of insect societies.
Queens monopolize reproduction, while workers perform
all the tasks necessary to maintain the colony. Queens
are typically seen as egg production units, to the point
where their function in insect societies has been com-
pared to that of the germline in multicellular organisms.
Some of our recent work has challenged this longstand-
ing view by revealing unexpected exibility in queens of
the black garden ant Lasius niger. We have shown that
the presence of workers inhibits brood care behavior in
founding queens. Moreover, we found that removing
workers from established colonies caused old queens to
revert to expressing brood care. These results indicate
that the presence of workers not only initiates, but also
maintains the behavioral specialization of queens that
can live up to 30 years. As a means to understand themolecular basis of queen behavioral specialization, we
have also performed brain RNAseq to identify genes that
dier in expression between queens with and without
workers. In this project, we will ask the question: What
are the gene regulatory mechanisms that regulate the
gene expression changes underlying the social control
of queen brood care behavior? The project will include
empirical and theoretical components. The empirical
investigations will involve the collection and experimen-
tal manipulations of ant colonies, extensive behavioral
analyses, RNAi knockdown of candidate genes, molec-
ular biology techniques, sequencing technologies (e.g.,
RNAseq, WGBS, ChIPseq) and associated bioinformat-
ics analyses. The theoretical aspects will be developed
in collaboration with Franjo Weissing, including via a
research stay in his group at the University of Gronin-
gen.
We are looking for a highly motivated student with
a Master degree (or equivalent) in biology, good En-
glish skills, and a keen interest in evolutionary biology.
Previous experience with social insects, molecular biol-
ogy, statistics and bioinformatics is advantageous, but
not required. The successful applicant will join an in-
ternational, interactive, dynamic and English-speaking
scientic environment in a brand new building with
access to state-of-the-art, newly equipped laboratories
and climate-controlled rooms. The JGU of Mainz hosts
many excellent scientic institutions, and Mainz is a
historic city located on the Rhine River with a large
student population and a rich social and cultural life.
Interested candidates should register to the IPP (https:/-
/ipp2.imb.de/registration) before 20 January 2022 and
complete their application before 27 January 2022. In-
formal enquiries should be sent to Dr. Romain Libbrecht

position of a
Doctoral Research Associate (Ph.D position) (salary
level TV-L E 13, 65%)
for the externally funded project SFB/TRR 212 at the
earliest possible date. We are oering a xed-term posi-
tion for 3 years.
Your tasks:
The position is part of the Collaborative Research Cen-
tre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled: A Novel Synthesis of Indi-
vidualisation across Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution:
Niche Choice, Niche Conformance, Niche Construction
(NC3), as granted by the German Research Foundation
(DFG).
This PhD projects aims to identify genetic frameworks
that mediate host conformance to shifting parasitolog-
ical niches. Therefore, the successful candidate will
investigate how local adaptation of the Mexican cave-
sh, Astyanax mexicanus, to dierent parasitological
niches aects its niche conformance. This will be done
using a eld- and lab-based approach. During the eld
work in Northern Mexico, dierent cave and river pop-
ulations of A. mexicanus will be sampled to describe
the spectrum of realized individual niches in these pop-ulations. This will include sampling and dissecting the
sh, recording and analysis of various physiological and
ecological parameters, and sampling and identifying the
parasites of individual sh. The lab-based approach will
then measure the degree of individual conformance of
lab-reared cave and river populations of A. mexicanus
by exposing sh to dierent eld-collected parasites
under controlled experimental conditions. Here, the
successful candidate will use single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) to identify the genetic mechanisms that con-
trol host conformance to varying parasitological niches.
Together with our collaboration partners within the
SFB, this project aims to give a detailed description
of the dierent parasitological niches in populations of
A. mexicanus and identify the genetic framework that
enables a host immune system to conform to shifting
parasitological niches.
Our expectations:
We are looking for a highly motivated scientist of any
nationality, who is interested in interdisciplinary work.
Candidates should have the equivalent of a master de-
gree in biology, preferentially with a focus on evolution
and physiology, or related elds. A background, and ide-
ally some experience, in any of the following areas will
be useful: sh handling, dissection and care, experience
with eld work and willingness to stay abroad for several
months per year, molecular and/or immunological skills
(especially cellular assays such as ow cytometry), as
well as a good understanding of statistical analysis using
R. They should also have excellent communication skills
and be able to work both independently and as part of
a multidisciplinary team. The working language of the
Institute and the lab is English, and good prociency
in spoken and written English is a requirement. Addi-
tionally, due to the prolonged stay in Mexico during the
eld work, good communicational skills in Spanish are
a plus. German language skills are not a requirement,
but a willingness to learn is desirable.
Advantages for you:
The Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity provides
a stimulating research environment with several
scientic groups researching diverse topics centred
on dierent aspects of evolution. The successful
candidate will join the team of Dr. Robert Peu >1

2nster, Germany, is seeking to ll the
position of a
Doctoral Student (Ph.D position)
(salary level TV-L E 13)
for the externally funded project SFB/TRR 212 at the
earliest possible date. We are oering a xed-term posi-
tion (65%) for 3 years.
Your tasks:
The position is part of the Collaborative Research Cen-
tre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled: A Novel Synthesis of Indi-
vidualisation across Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution:
Niche Choice, Niche Conformance, Niche Construction
(NC3), as granted by the German Research Foundation
(DFG).
This PhD project deals with the ecological and evolu-
tionary eects of parasite virulence. In this project,you will investigate the niche construction eects of
a trophically transmitted tapeworm parasite (Schisto-
cephalus solidus) on individual three-spined stickleback
sh. The project aims to show how these eects cascade
from the individual to the ecosystem level and alter
eco-evolutionary dynamics. The successful candidate
will be involved in mesocosm experiments to investi-
gate how parasite virulence aects individual trophic
specialisation of the hosts. We also aim to identify
the physiological and metabolic traits associated with
these individual dierences. The successful candidate
will further take advantage of transcriptomic datasets
to identify the immuno-physiological traits associated
with host niche individualisation, and contribute to the
development of computational models that will bridge
the gap between individual, population, and community
processes.
Our expectations:
Applicants should be highly motivated scientists of any
nationality, who are interested in interdisciplinary work.
They should have the equivalent of a master degree in
biology, preferentially with a focus on evolution and
ecology, or related elds. A background, and ideally
some experience, in any of the following areas will be
useful: sh handling and care, limnology, molecular
skills, individual-based models, as well as a good under-

PhD position at the University of Potsdam and Max
Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology (Germany)
Background Innovation is the ability to produce new be-
haviours or to apply novel solutions to old problems, in-
troducing novel variants into a population's behavioural
repertoire. While individual animals often produce in-
novations, only a few of these novel behavioural variants
are transmitted, maintained, adopted and integrated
in the population's repertoire. The interplay between
individual innovation propensity, behavioural/cognitive
make-up of the innovator and observer(s), as well as
the strength of their bond, could determine the spread
and maintenance of innovations in a population, which
could lead to the establishment of local traditions and
cultures.
In this project we aim to analyse the interplay between
personality, innovation propensity and spread of innova-
tions in house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) living
under semi-natural conditions. We will determine the
inuence of individual (e.g. rank, sex) and social prole
of innovator and observer in the spread of innovations
across the population, to increase our understanding
of the role of individual characteristics in the diusion
of innovations within populations. We will also investi-
gate the evolutionary importance of innovativeness by
assessing the impact on natural and sexual selection.
To strengthen our team and conduct this project, we
are looking for a PhD candidate/Scientic Researcher
(f/m/d) This project was jointly developed by the Uni-
versity of Potsdam and the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Biology, and is fully funded by the German
Science Foundation (DFG) for a period of 3 years (36
months) with a salary of 65% TVL oD-13. The Institute
for Biochemistry and Biology (IBB) is the largest in-
stitute within the Faculty of Science of the University
of Potsdam. The research activities of the IBB range
from Molecular Biology, to Plant and Systems Biology,
to Ecology and Evolution. Within the IBB, the Animal
Ecology Group employs dierent ecological, life-history
and behavioural tools to better understand the evo-
lutionary adaptation of animals to their environment.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in
Pl on (Schleswig-Holstein) consists of three departments:
Evolutionary Genetics, Evolutionary Theory, and Micro-January 1, 2022 EvolDir 31

explain fundamental processes in evolutionary biology,
such as ecological adaptations, the origin of sexuality,
or the evolution of cooperativity.

sity degree (Master degree) in the eld of animal be-
haviour, cognition or comparable. - Proven experience
in collecting and analysing data from direct behavioural
observations. - Excellent knowledge of English and prior
experience in the production of scientic texts.
- Very good competence in working with animals. - Ex-

UppsalaU Y-chromosomeEvolution
A 4-year PhD position is available within evolutionary
genetics at the Department of Ecology and Genetics
(Evolutionary Biology program), Uppsala University,
Sweden
This project will investigate the evolution of Y chromo-
some within the conceptual framework of sexual antag-
onism. It will involve long-term experimental evolution
methods as well as phylogenetic and comparative tran-
scriptomic analysis to investigate the origins, mainte-
nance and function of non-neutral genetic variation in a
heteromorphic Y chromosome. The project utilizes the
seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus where we have
recently discovered unusually high amount on Y-linked
variation important for male tness related traits. Using
experimental evolution, the plan is to test for negative
frequency dependent selection on Y haplotypes under
varying sexual selection and resource competition con-
ditions. RNA-sequencing will be utilized to examine
the role of epistasis in Y-linked regulatory variation
aecting gene expression. The project will also inves-
tigate the frequency of dierent Y-haplotypes in the
natural populations of C. maculatus and examine their
evolution across seed beetle species using phylogenetic
analysis. The PhD student position includes research,
courses and literature studies.

Social behaviour, demography and conservation in shore-
birds PhD studentship based in Eesk e Budijovice, Czech
Republic 2022-2025 Supervisors: Dr Vojtich Kubelka
(Uni. of South Bohemia, CZ) Prof Tam as Sz ekely (Uni.
of Bath, UK)
Sex roles (i.e. courtship, competition for mates, pair
bonding and parenting) are among the most diverse
social behaviour. Recent research is uncovering key
elements of sex role variation, but signicant gaps re-
main. Appropriate sexual behaviour is essential for
reproduction, and thus understanding the causes and
implications of sex roles are at the core of evolutionary
biology and fundamental for the study of life history
evolution, physiology and population biology. Under-
standing sex roles and demography (reproduction and
mortality rates) is also important for biodiversity con-
servation since disruptions to normal sexual behaviour
due to environmental changes reduce the viability of
wild populations.
Our group is running an international project
~ALVONAL Shorebird Science: https://-
elvonalshorebirds.com/ with teams distributed
worldwide to investigate sex role evolution in shorebirds.
This PhD project will focus on sex role behaviour
and demography in shorebirds. Using behavioural
observations in wild populations it will investigate
causes of courtship behaviour, pair bonding and
parenting. The PhD student will test whether (i) sex
role behaviours are induced by ambient environment,
demographic parameters or social environment, (ii)
explore the relationship between dierent sex role
components, and (iii) test the tness implications
of sex role variations. We are also interested in the
conservation implications of shorebird eld biology and
the particular targeting of the PhD project will be
developed together with a successful applicant.
The ideal candidate has a strong interest in evolutionary
biology, behavioural ecology and eld biology, willing to
work in remote areas, e.g. Arctic regions, South Amer-
ica, South Africa or elsewhere. He/she needs to have asolid background in data analyses preferably in R, and
statistical modelling. A condition of the application is
a Master degree (or equivalent) in biology, zoology or a
similar subject. Experience in eld ornithology and bird
ringing or the use of comparative methods is desirable
but not essential. The studentship can start during
March - September 2022. We are preferably seeking
candidates willing to raise their own funding but there
are other options too.
Eesk e Budijovice is a vibrant medium-sized city and
centre of South Bohemian region with an international
university community. The University of South Bohemia
is the biggest higher education institution in the region
with more than 9,000 students, numerous leading de-
partments in natural sciences and eld research stations
at Svalbard or Papua New Guinea. Five institutes of
the Czech Academy of Sciences are situated on the same
campus, forming the Biological Centre and representing
outstanding cooperation opportunities. The surround-
ing of Eesk e Budijovice has diverse natural and cultural
landscapes, including ^Aumava National Park, two UN-
ESCO biosphere reserves and numerous protected areas
with impressive wildlife.
Interested candidates should contact Vojtich Kubelka

(max 3 pages) and a max 2 pages cover letter with per-
sonal motivation and the name and contact details of
two references (both documents in English) should be

UTurku ConservationBiology
Investigating conservation actions improving bird re-
sponses to climate warming in Europe
Application deadline: 31 January 2022. A fully funded
4-year PhD position in conservation biology is opened
at the University of Turku (Finland).
Project background: How biodiversity will respond to34 EvolDir January 1, 2022
climate warming is one of the most challenging issues
for conservation. Species can cope with climate warm-
ing by shifting their distributions or persist in local
micro-refuges (Dawson et al. 2011), but these responses
have been found insucient to ensure long-term bio-
diversity conservation. Inside protected areas, species
responses to climate warming are facilitated (Thomas
et al. 2012; Gaget et al. 2021), but so far, we are
ignorant of what actually are the conservation actions
that causes protected areas to help species respond to
climate change (Gaget et al. 2022). In other words:
What would be the best conservation measures to set
up a climate adaptation strategy? This project aims
to answer this question for birds at the European level,
by making a cost-eectiveness assessment of the conser-
vation actions that aect species responses to climate
warming, considering conservation priorities and species
ecological niches. Bird responses to climate warming
are currently insucient and although birds are speci-
cally targeted by European Union conservation policies,
no specic conservation measures have been designated
to facilitate their responses to climate warming. This
project will thus contribute to our understanding of bird
species responses to climate change, identify conserva-
tion actions improving their resilience or distribution
change in response to climate warming and help plan-
ning more eective conservation measures for future
protected areas.
PhD tasks: This four year PhD project will be situ-
ated at the University of Turku (Turku, Finland) and
supervised by Dr. Elie Gaget and Prof Jon E. Brom-
mer, in collaboration with Dr. Martin Jung from IIASA
(Laxenburg, Austria). The project will use informa-
tion about the management practices funded under the
EU LIFE programme inside Natura 2000 protected ar-
eas, and 40,000 abundance time series of almost 450
bird species (breeding and non-breeding) across Europe.
Using hierarchical modelling based on local abundance
time series, the candidate will quantify past and forecast
future population changes with regards to interactions
between conservation measures and climate warming.
The framework will take into account species habitat
preferences, functional traits and shifts in ecological
niches over time to provide additional context to the
expected species population changes. The project will
yield a minimum of four scientic publications and the
results will be discussed with stakeholders in Europe.
Qualications: Essential qualications for this position
are: (1) MSc in Biology, preferably with a Major in
Ecology or related eld; (2) quantitative skills and com-
fortable working in R; (3) strong communication skills,
with abilities to speak and write in English. Desired
qualications include technical skills in one or more ofthe following areas: (1) Handling large databases; (2)
hierarchical modelling and/or species distribution mod-
els; (3) ornithology and/or protected area management.
We are looking for a candidate with a strong interest in
conservation biology, clear capacity to self-organize, and
a communicative personality who works team-oriented.
Terms: The positions are open to domestic and in-
ternational candidates and we encourage all qualied
individuals to apply. Applications will be accepted until
January 31, 2022. Start dates are exible but will ideally
be during the rst six months of 2022. The PhD stu-
dent will be supported by a scholarship of 30 000 ?/year
over four years (excluding tax) and will be covered by
national health benets. The position starts with a trial
period of 6 months.
Place of work: The Ph.D. position is based in the De-
partment of Biology situated in the main campus of the
University of Turku (www.utu.), close to the centre of
the city of Turku. The city of Turku is a small town that
hosts two Universities with an active student life, and
is situated in the south-west corner of Finland. Finland
was in 2021 ranked as the happiest country in the world
for the fourth year in a row in the World Happiness Re-
port. The Ph.D. student will be part of a community of
about 90 Ph.D. students in the Doctoral Program in Bi-
ology, Geography and Geology that provides additional
support for completing the Ph.D. degree.
Applications should include: cover letter in English de-
scribing your motivation, research interests and previous
relevant experience with respect to the above listed re-
quirements; Curriculum vitae including contacts of two
referents; copies of MSc/BSc/Diploma certicates. In-
terviews will be conducted in a virtual format in early
February.

Invasion dynamics of selsh DNA
Life is a struggle for survival where parasites prey on
their hosts and hosts combat their parasites. Surprising
to many, this battle also rages in our genomes. Parasitic
DNA spreads in our genomes, even if this is harming our
health. These parasitic sequences, also called transpos-
able elements (TEs) have been remarkably successful,
constituting more than 50% of our genomes.
TEs are closely related to viruses and frequently invade
novel species, where they multiply while hosts struggle
to suppress them. Eventually, most hosts succeed in
downregulating the activity of the invading TE. It is
however unclear how the host defense is established and
what factors inuence the silencing of TEs. To shed
light on these important open questions we will investi-
gate the invasions of several TE families in experimental
Drosophila populations using cutting-edge technologies
such as small RNA sequencing, RNA-Seq, and long-read
sequencing (Oxford Nanopore).
This project will allow the student to work on an exciting
topic with a young and international team, get in con-
tact with cutting-edge technologies and receive rst-rate
training in bioinformatics. The project will involve 70%
lab work and 30% computer work. Wet-lab experience
(e.g. molecular cloning, PCR) and some programming
skills (e.g. R, bash, Python) will be benecial.
The salary is internationally competitive (14 times

time elected as the most liveable city in the world.

Are piRNA clusters the central force limiting the abun-
dance of selsh DNA?
Transposable elements (TEs) are stretches of parasitic
DNA that multiply in our genomes. The genomes of
most species are riddled with remnants of past TE
invasions. Interestingly the TE composition diers dra-
matically among species, with some species having many
TEs and others having very few. What is responsible
for these pronounced dierences among species? We
still do not have an answer to this central open problem
in evolutionary biology.
Here we will test a promising hypothesis. Computer sim-
ulations show that the size of piRNA clusters - genomic
regions that produce small RNA that suppresses TEs
- could be a major factor determining the abundance
of TEs. In this project, we will probe the relation-
ship between the abundance of TEs and the size of
piRNA clusters in multiple Drosophila species using
cutting-edge approaches such as small RNA sequencing,
long-read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore), and popula-
tion genetic simulations. We will complement this work
by estimating the tness consequences of TE insertions
in experimental Drosophila populations.
This project will allow the student to work on an exciting
topic with a young and international team, get in con-
tact with cutting-edge technologies and receive rst-rate
training in bioinformatics. The project will involve 35%
lab work and 65% computer work. Some programming
skills (e.g. R, bash, Python) will be benecial.

selected candidate will focus mainly on preparing whole,
small mammal NEON specimens - each year approxi-
mately 350 specimens as study skins with skulls and 500
specimens for ethanol preservation. The former prepa-
ration method also requires maintenance of an in-house
dermestid beetle colony. As time and needs indicate,
they will also contribute to the preparation and digitiza-
tion of terrestrial and aquatic vascular plant specimens
(herbarium sheets and packets). Regular duties related
to these tasks may include: physical transfer of collection
objects into the NEON Biorepository sample infrastruc-ture; maintenance of the collection organization; shared

BangorU ForestBiodiversity
Full time Research Project Support Ocer (RPSO):
Forest restoration metabarcoding biodiversity analyses,
with the Horizon Europe SUPERB project.
We are looking for a dynamic researcher to full a key
role in a new, collaborative and multidisciplinary team
working at the interface between forest biodiversity,
restoration and molecular ecology, environmental and
remote sensing.
Forests harbour substantial fractions of biodiversity, pro-
vide a multitude of societal ecosystem services and, via
large scale tree planting, represent a powerful nature-
based solution for climate change mitigation. Yet, forest
biodiversity is under threat via climate change and inten-
sifying disturbances (e.g. droughts, bark beetles, res,
and storms), but also face risks from non-adapted forest
management practices and unsustainable exploitation.
In the euro 20M Horizon Europe Green Deal SUPERB
project the overall goal is creating an enabling environ-
ment for, and demonstration of, largescale restoration
of forests and forest landscapes across Europe. Along
with the project team, the post holder will be responsi-
ble for planning, organising and conducting large-scale
metabarcoding biodiversity analyses, focused on forest
restoration. Although not a formal requirement for the
role, there will be an opportunity to register for a post-
graduate, PhD program, that will be integrated into the
highly successful ENVISION NERC Doctoral Training
Program (http://www.envision-dtp.org/), enabling fur-
ther opportunities for bioinformatic, statistical training
and analyses and publishing a series of collaborative
manuscripts and subsequent award of a PhD thesis. In
essence, the role oers the ability to pursue a paid PhD
program. Irrespective of either route, project manage-
ment and liaising with external partners and the project
team will be integral to the role.
The SUPERB consortium comprises 36 institutions
highly experienced in rewilding, nature-based solutions
and ecological, economic and governance issues of forest
and forest landscape restoration. Bangor University
will work closely with the Universities of Lancaster,
UK and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences
(SLU) in Ume ~A¥to assess restoration success at up to
6 demonstration sites across Europe, incorporating, and
exploring synergies between cutting edge remote sensingapproaches, DNA metabarcoding, environmental vari-
ables and species distribution models, citizen science
and bioacoustics.
The Bangor component of the SUPERB project will
utilise metabarcoding of soil and aerial arthropod sam-
ples, to assess biodiversity, bioinformatics and ecological
modelling, with the RPSO working closely with a di-
verse team of collaborators from the elds of acoustic
and remote sensing, species distribution modelling and
forest restoration throughout 6 sites across Europe.
Candidates should possess a degree, or equivalent quali-
cation in related areas such as natural sciences, biotech-
nology, molecular biology and should ideally have pre-
vious experience of eldwork, molecular ecology (e.g.
metabarcoding analyses). The successful candidate will
be expected to commence as soon as convenient in 2022,
with the contract expiring on 30/11/2025.
Informal enquiries should be sent to Profs. S. Creer

HasseltU Belgium Hermaphrodites
Vacancy
The Faculty of Sciences, capacity group Biology-Geology,
Research Institute: Centre for Environmental Sciences,
research group Zoology: Biodiversity and Toxicology
of Hasselt University and the Operational Directorate
Taxonomy and Phylogeny at the Royal Belgian Institute
of Natural Sciences (RBINS) seek a (m/f/x) :
FED-tWIN Researcher on hermaphrodite taxonomy:
50% Tenure track lecturer at UHasselt and 50%
Workleader (SW2) at RBINS
Background
The FED-TWiN program is a cooperation eort between
the Belgian federal institutes and the Belgian univer-
sities. Within this program, researchers are recruited
to work on a research project that is supervised by two
promotors, one from a BFI and one from a university.
This job posting conforms to the FED-tWIN prole
Prf-2020-006 HerTax; Hermaphrodite Taxonomy.
At UHasselt your research activities will be embedded
within the Research Group Zoology: Biodiversity and
Toxicology (Department of Biology) and the Centre for
Environmental Sciences (CMK). The Centre for Envi-
ronmental Sciences is a research institute of Hasselt
University that opts for a wellbalanced combination and
symbiosis between environmentally{related fundamen-
tal and applied research in a multidisciplinary research
environment. The research group and the CMK have
extensive (inter)national collaborations.
At RBINS your research activities will be embedded in
the Operational Directorate Taxonomy and Phylogeny,
which specializes in the study of the taxonomy, phy-
logeny and evolution of various metazoan taxa. In ad-
dition, the OD attaches great importance to providing
scientic services, particularly species identications, the
support of citizen science activities and public outreach.
As such, the OD is involved in several (inter)national
programmes.
Education task
At UHasselt, you provide high{quality education in
the bachelor program of Biology, more sepcically in
courses on (molecular) taxonomy, population genetics,
and (molecular) evolution/phylogeny. You will also
contribute to the supervision of bachelor and mastertheses.
At RBINS you will contribute to the course program of-
fered by the Distributed European School of Taxonomy
(DEST).
Research mission
The selected candidate will develop and perform research
within the FED-tWIN project Prf-2020-006 HerTax;
Hermaphrodite Taxonomy. Within this project the tax-
onomic diversity, speciation, and invasion biology of
three groups will be investigated in relation to their
breeding systems: pulmonate gastropods, atworms
and oligochaetes. This will be done by means of an
integrative taxonomic and methodological approach,
based on a combination of phenotypic and genomic
analyses using up to date methods and tools, includ-
ing light microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy,
micro-computed tomography, and DNA data obtained
by classical (e.g. DNA barcoding, microsatellite DNA,
. . . ) and Next-Generation DNA Sequencing technolo-
gies. These latter may include mitogenomics, Restric-
tion Site-Associated DNA Sequencing, full genome se-
quencing, transcriptomics, and other techniques that
undoubtedly will become available in the years to come.
On the longer term, phenotypic and genomic diversity
will be linked to epigenetic markers (e.g. DNA methy-
lation patterns) and gut microbiota diversity, so as to
explore the holobiont concept. The research will involve
a strong phenotypic, i.e. \descriptive taxonomy", com-
ponent because natural selection acts dierentially upon
competing phenotypes and by doing so it changes the
genetic composition of populations in function of the
link between phenotypes and their underlying genotypes.
Hence understanding evolution by natural selection re-
quires a sound phenotypic framework as provided by
descriptive taxonomy. Beyond its fundamental scientic
relevance, this research prole will have two important,
applied scientic spinos by its contribution to collection
management and by providing identication expertise
on species in the focal groups.
Prole
*PhD in Sciences (Biology) or Applied Biological Sci-
ences (or equivalent) with an explicit prole in descrip-
tive taxonomy, evolutionary biology and molecular sys-
tematics of invertebrates, preferably of the groups men-
tioned in the research mission.
The PhD should be obtained maximum 12 years be-
fore the submission date. This 12-year period is ex-
tended with 1 year for each absence because of maternity,
parental, adoption, long-term illness of the candidate or
of a rst-degree family member.
* Academic sta must meet the statutory language re-January 1, 2022 EvolDir 53
quirements for knowledge of the language of instruction
(Dutch). If necessary, Hasselt University oers concrete,
tailored support measures to help achieve the required
language level.
* You have excellent organizational and communication
skills. Being familiar with developping and maintain-
ing websites and communication through digital social
media (Facebook, Twitter, ...) is an asset.

The opportunity: The Museum fuer Naturkunde Berlin
has an internationally visible Center for Integrative
Biodiversity Discovery. It will meet the scientic
and societal challenges arising from rapid worldwide
ecosystem change, not least the global biodiversity
crisis, and capitalise on the chances and innovations
from biodiversity. The Center will develop new
scientic approaches to the study of biodiversity that
will contribute to a more ecient and signicantly
faster global biodiversity inventory. At the same time it
will enable high-quality taxonomic research on extinct
and recent organisms and develop targeted knowledge
products for various user groups.
We are seeking three talented and motivated biodiversity
researchers (f/m/d) with a focus on methods to develop
and support the new Center for Integrative Biodiversity
Discovery at the Museum fuer Naturkunde Berlin
Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science.To this purpose, the successful candidates will take a
leading role in the development of innovative methods
for species discovery and apply them to the taxonomy of
hyperdiverse arthropod clades. The research should be
embedded in the program of the Center for Integrative
Biodiversity Discovery and involve engagement in
grant applications as well as training and supervision
of students and junior researchers. We also expect
active participation in public outreach activities of the
museum about biodiversity and biodiversity discovery.
A particular focus of the Center is to develop new ways
for the automatic discovery and description of species.
For this purpose we combine biodiversity robotics
with ?DNA barcoding and machine learning so that
invertebrates can also be automatically identied by
image in the future (see https://www.science.org/news/-
2021/06/articial-intelligence-could-help-biologists-
classify-world-s-tiny-creatures).
The Museum fuer Naturkunde Berlin provides an excel-
lent research environment. It houses state-of-the-art lab-
oratories for morphology (including histology, imaging,
SEM, and CT labs), molecular genetics/genomics and

genetics, phylogenetics, developmental and evolution-
ary genetics, and taxonomy. Our world-class zoological
collections provide unique access to specimens collected
over the last 200+ years.
Requirements: PhD or PhD candidate in zoology with
a signicant publication record in collection-based bio-
diversity research on hyperdiverse terrestrial or limnic
arthropod clades that are ideally dark taxa (clades where
<10% of all species are described and the estimated
diversity is >1000 species). The successful candidates
must have described new species in dark taxa and should
have experience in developing innovative research ap-
proaches to taxonomy that combine high-throughput
sequencing and morphological data. Demonstrated ex-
perience in working on international research projects
and obtaining third-party funding. Field work experi-
ence, preferably also in larger collaborative projects and
willingness to participate in research in one of MfN's
geographic focus regions (e.g., Southeast Asia, Africa)
are expected. Successful candidates will be expected to
work in an interdisciplinary environment at Germany's
largest natural history museum. Excellent team player,
proven communication skills and intercultural compe-
tence. Professional written and verbal communication

UCL Excellence Fellowship Programme 2021
UCL's Excellence Fellowship Programme seeks to recruit
the highest calibre early career researchers from across
the globe, supporting clinical or non-clinical researchers
to develop an outstanding and innovative research pro-
gramme and to establish their independent research
careers.
The support for this round of fellowships comes from
UCL's Eugenics Restitution fund. UCL scientists in
the early 20th century were involved in formulating the
principles of Eugenics and encouraging their adoption.
Policies enacted in the name of Eugenics around the
world targeted specic groups of people, including those
of lower economic status, ethnic minorities, and peo-
ple with disabilities. UCL wholly rejects these views
and as a step towards redressing these injustices, and
as recommended by UCL's recent Eugenics inquiries,
we aim to appoint two Excellence Fellows to address
the current underrepresentation of groups targeted by
Eugenics. The Fellowships will support applicants who
have experienced hardship or been disadvantaged in the
pursuit of their education and early research career. We
therefore particularly welcome applications from the
BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) community
and those with disabilities.
In this round two fellowships in the life and medical
sciences are available to be based in the Research Depart-
ment of Genetics, Evolution and Environment (GEE).
Applications are particularly welcomed from candidates
using genetics to address questions in ageing and age-
related disease; the origin of life, major transitions, the
early diversication of eukaryotic life; the evolution of
eukaryotic development and cell types; theoretical evo-
lutionary modelling; computational approaches applied
to big data; microbiology and disease ecology/evolution;
cross-disciplinary applied and translational ecology; com-
munity or behavioural ecology (especially relating to
plants, insects and/or microbes) or other disciplines in
the department: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee
. ROLE DETAILS Term: Three years funding in the
rst instance.
Grade and salary: Posts will be oered at UCL Grade 8
(45,610 - 53,757 per annum inclusive of London allowanceand depending on experience). Clinical applicants will
be appointed on the appropriate equivalent STR or
JDPD scales; Please note that consultant salaries will
not be covered by the programme at any point during
the fellowship and clinicians will be expected to com-
plete the fellowship prior to taking up a consultant level
post.
Closing Date: 4pm, 10th January, 2022
Further information and FAQs about the 2021 UCL Ex-
cellence Fellowship Programme and application process

ternatively, applicants can contact the GEE Fellowship

Call 3 ESEB Awards
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2022 - Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a greatbeliever in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB annually oers mobility grants for young scientists
in his name.
Closing date: FRIDAY, 21 JANUARY 2022.
*Eligibility:*
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and ESEB
members. In addition, applicants will be considered
who are more than 6 years from the start of their PhD
if they have had career breaks, worked part-time, or for
other reasons have not worked continuously. Applicants
who have previously received a Godfrey Hewitt mobility
award are not eligible. The maximum single award will
be 2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or
a period of research at a lab that you have not previ-
ously visited. There is no restriction on the country of
residence or nationality of the applicant.
Due to the COVID-19 situation, and in order to pro-
mote responsible and safe travel without compromising
the quality of research, grantees of the 2022 ESEB God-
frey Hewitt mobility awards will be allowed to travel
within 24 months from the date of announcement of the
winners.
*Application procedure:*
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Moniatte at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from your
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded from
your home institution or your proposed host institution.
Please renew your ESEB membership or join the society
preferably only in January, as ESEB is changing its
membership system at the end of 2021.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Constantino Macias Garcia. The aim will be to an-
nounce decisions before the end of March 2022. The
committee will consider the following key criteria:
1. The value of the proposed mobility in terms of its
expected output and impact on the applicant's career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant's existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant's own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.January 1, 2022 EvolDir 73
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant's career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.
Best wishes, Ute Moniatte, ESEB Oce Manager.

Dear Colleagues may I draw your attention to the fol-
lowing Call for Papers in Development Genes and Evolu-
tion, which may be of interest to evolutionary biologists
whose research touches upon stem cell biology within
the context of the evolution of regeneration mechanisms
and asexual life histories, including phylogenetic andevo-
devo approaches.
Call for Papers: Special issue on Stem cell biodiversity
and innovation
The current focus in stem cell research is limited to a
handful of tractable genetic model systems from only
a few lineages. However, this fails to embrace the di-
versity of stem cell systems across the Tree of Life. As
such, our understanding of what constitutes a stem cell
and how it is regulated in dierent organisms and at
dierent life stages is highly polarised. This issue aims
toll gaps in our understanding of stem cell distribution
and regulation across eukaryote diversity, and thereby
contribute to better dening the stem cell concept.
Topics of particular interest include:
How stem cells contribute to adult homeostasis or nor-
mal physiological turnover in poorly studied taxaInnova-
tive methods to identify and analyse stem cell lineages-
from molecular to microscopicallyThe role of stem cells
in alternative life history strategies (asexual reproduc-
tion, dormancy etc)The identication of novel stem cell
systems in traditional model systemsComparative analy-
sis of stem cell properties within a phylogenetic context-
The characterisation of stem cell \niches"Conceptual
and theoretical advances in dening stem cells
We invite submissions of review articles, original re-
search, and short communications.However, we partic-
ularly encourage the publication of short reports high-
lighting novel ndings or preliminary experiments that
address a specic hypothesis to advance our understand-
ing of the stem cell concept.
Submission deadline: 30 April 2022
Please contact the Associate Editor Dr Ildiko Somorjai
atimls@st-andrews.ac.ukfor submission enquiries. Fur-
ther information on editorial policy is available on the

Editorial roles at EvolutionLetters
Three Opportunities with Evolution Letters
*Communications Editor, Preprints Editor and Asso-
ciate Editor*
*1) ** Communications Editor*
Evolution Letters seeks a new Communications Editor
to work with our authors to help promote new research
to wider audiences. The role will be particularly well
suited to an early career evolutionary biologist with a
keen interest in science communication.
The Communications Editor is responsible for the fol-
lowing:
- Liaising with authors of accepted articles to coordinate
promotion of their papers.
- Producing day-to-day Twitter content for the journal.
- Maintaining the Evolution Letters blog, developing
blog content and soliciting blog posts from authors.
- Developing other communication channels, including
the expansion of the Evolution Letters YouTube channel
and exploration of other social media platforms such as
Instagram.
The time commitment required varies depending on
publication rates, but typically averages around 2 hours
per week.
Applicants must have a broad interest in evolutionary
biology, science communication, and the use of social
media in promoting scientic research. You should be
self-motivated, able to work unsupervised, able to deliver
to deadlines, and familiar with the journal Evolution
Letters and the work of its societies (ESEB and SSE).
The successful applicant will have the opportunity for a
full hand-over of the role with the exiting Communica-
tions Editor.The Communications Editor receives the following ben-
ets:
-$2000 annual honorarium
- ESEB membership
- Personal development of science communication skills
- Experience of working within an editorial team to
promote high quality science
*2) **Preprints Editor*
Evolution Letters seeks a new Preprints Editor to help
identify exciting preprints that t the journal's remit
and scope. The role will be suited to a mid-career evo-
lutionary biologist with a keen eye for the best research
across the eld of evolutionary biology and a reputation
for producing high-quality research.
The preprints editor is responsible for the following:
- Regularly checking bioRxiv and other preprint servers
for exciting evolutionary research
- Contacting corresponding authors of preprints and
inviting them to submit the work to *Evolution Let-
ters.*
It is expected that you would spend 1-2 hours per week
identifying the best research and contacting / corre-
sponding with authors. The successful applicant will
have the opportunity to discuss with the Editor-in-Chief
what sort of papers would be ideally suited to the jour-
nal. The role is distinct from an Associate Editor role;.
you would not be expected to handle preprints that are
subsequently submitted to the journal.
*3) **Associate Editor with specialism in Experimental
Evolution*
Evolution Letters seeks a new Associate Editor whose
research expertise includes experimental evolution. The
role will be suited to an early-, mid- or late-career group
leader who has a reputation for carrying out cutting-
edge research using any experimental evolution system.
You will be responsible for the following:
- Handling manuscripts, primarily but not exclusively,
covering experimental evolution research
- Encouraging authors of cutting-edge experimental evo-
lution research to submit their manuscripts to *Evolu-
tion Letters *e.g. after hearing the work presented in
seminars or at conferences.
It is anticipated that you will handle up to 20 (proba-
bly fewer) manuscripts per year, using the ScholarOne
manuscript management system. Manuscripts are ini-
tially assessed for suitability by the Editorial Oce and
the Editor-in-Chief, before the E-i-C assigns them toJanuary 1, 2022 EvolDir 75
an associate editor. You will then make a decision on
whether manuscripts are sent to review, identify suitable
reviewers and make an editorial recommendation when
reviews are returned.
All three roles provide an honorarium of US $2000 per
annum and membership of ESEB.
How to apply:
Please send a 2-page CV along with max. 1 page cover
letter explaining why you are interested in the role to
the Editor-in-Chief, Jon Slate ( j.slate@sheeld.ac.uk).
The Editor-in-Chief welcomes enquiries about the roles.
Deadline for applications: Friday 17th December 2021
Interviews will be held remotely by video call in early
January 2022, with the successful applicants taking up
their roles as soon as possible afterwards.
Evolution Letters and its parent societies wish to make
evolutionary biology inclusive and accessible to a wide,
diverse audience. We believe that building a diverse
editorial board is a crucial part of this. We strongly
encourage applications from people that are currently
under-represented on our board, including people of
colour, people from countries outside of Europe and
North America, people with disabilities, and people who
are LGB, Trans or Non-Binary.

ESEB OutreachInitiativeFund
DeadlineMar15
**ESEB Outreach Initiative Fund**
The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
welcomes applications to the ESEB Outreach Initiative
Fund for projects that promote evolution-related activ-
ities. The goal of this initiative is to improve public
knowledge about evolution globally.
Applications for funding will be accepted for educational
initiatives that promote evolution, translation of evolu-
tionary material (books, lms, and websites) intendedfor a general audience, public outreach seminars, public
exhibitions, etc.
There will be a single call per year with a total budget
of 20,000 Euro. A single project can be funded with up
to 4,000 Euro, but smaller projects are welcome. We
are requesting a report after one year, at which time
the project should be completed.
Please use the ESEB application form to submit your
proposal and note the word limits given herein. The
form can be downloaded at the ESEB website: https://-
eseb.org Proposals will be accepted until *15th MARCH
2022* and should be submitted by email to the ESEB
oce (Email: oce@eseb.org; Subject: Outreach 2022).
Note that we will acknowledge receipt of all applications
within a week. If you have not received our conrmation
by then, please contact the ESEB oce again!
Please note that scientic meetings are not supported
by ESEB Outreach Initiative funds. These fund also do
not work as a mechanism for continual funding. Once
the potential of a project has been demonstrated, this
should be used as a basis to convince other funding
sources on continuation funds. Hence, submissions by a
group that has been successful in past calls may be pe-
nalized if the proposals are mere follow-ups of previous
projects.
The applications will be evaluated by the Outreach
Initiative Committee:

Online ESEB STN Speciation Jan11
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce a new monthly online semi-
nar series, launching on the 11th of January 2022 . This
series is organised by a Special Topic Network called
\Integration of speciation research" (IOS), funded by the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB). The
network aims to establish a framework for integrative
speciation research, by developing tools for comparative
analyses (e.g. a publicly available speciation database)
and organising activities (seminars, workshops) to fa-
cilitate discussion and knowledge exchange between all
corners of speciation research. More information can be
found on the IOS network website [ https://speciation-
network.pages.ist.ac.at/ ] .
The seminar series will centre around the broad aims of
the network, which are: i) To understand the relative
importance of dierent barriers to gene ow and outline
best practices to measure them. ii) To survey the role of
interactions and coupling between barriers in increasing
reproductive isolation. iii) To seek common genomic
patterns underlying barriers as reproductive isolation
increases. iv) To bridge the knowledge gap between
what is known of speciation mechanisms at a microevo-
lutionary scale and the knowledge of speciation rates &
their determinants at a macroevolutionary scale.
The rst instalment of the IOS seminar series aims at
bridging the gap between macroevolutionary patterns
and microevolutionary mechanisms, with a focus on big-
ger questions in speciation research. We will welcome
Leonie Moyle (Professor, Department of Biology, Indi-
ana University) and Daniel Matute (Assistant Professor,
Department of Biology, University of North Carolina) as
speakers. The session will take place on 11th of January
2022 at 5 pm CET, lasting 1.5 hours. The rst hour
is dedicated to talks and questions, and the nal 30
minutes is dedicated to a discussion session. To attend
the sessions live, please follow the links below.

The IOS network does not only aim at scientic inte-
gration, but also integration of the community. A main
objective on this front is to foster diversity and inclu-
sion across the eld. The seminar series and subsequent
discussion is open to everyone, from students to estab-
lished researchers and non-scientists alike. In order to
maximise the geographic diversity of attendees, we will
alternate between two time slots every other month:
5 pm CET (January) and 8 am CET (February) etc..
Please help us to circulate this email to anyone who
may be interested, especially those in countries that are
typically underrepresented in scientic discourse.
The seminar series programme will be announced by
email, on Twitter (@Speciation net) and on the IOS
network website. People who wish to automatically
receive the programme and other news from the network
can sign up to the IOS network mailing list [ https:/-

Sequencing Costs
Dear all,
Recently, the iconic NHGRI plot of sequencing cost since
2000 ( https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-
sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data) got me thinking
about the cost of sequence data acquisition since, say,
1960.
As I understand things, the super-Moore's-Law decline
in sequencing costs starting in 2007 corresponds to the
end of Sanger sequencing for bulk work. But what
about earlier shifts in DNA technology? For example,
what happened when ABI uorescent-labeled ddNTPs
replaced radiolabeled? Ditto Sanger sequencing vis  >1
2
vis RFLPs? RFLPs vs protein sequencing? Did the
(exponential) slope change at those moments as well?
Does anyone have any data on that? Or know where I
might look?

The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE) Diver-
sity Committee (DC) seeks to add two new members
starting in late January of 2022. The DC works to
support members from all backgrounds through several
main actions: by broadening representation to the SSE
Executive Council, by pursuing initiatives that support
historically excluded groups, and by creating an inclu-
sive, accessible environment at the Evolution conference
and in evolutionary biology in general.
Applicants should submit a brief (1-2 page) statement
of interest outlining three items on which applications
will be evaluated: 1) their experience with Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) service; 2) any ideas, prior-
ities, and/or events they plan to contribute during their
3-year term; 3) the unique elements of their perspec-
tive/background that they bring to the committee. We
are especially in search of members who have experience
in leading and completing successful projects related to
equity and inclusion, even in challenging circumstances.
In previous years, the majority of our applicants have
been graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.
We encourage applications from individuals who are in
secure or post-tenure academic or non-academic posi-
tions. Note that the needs of the committee change
every year, and we will be again welcoming early career
members in upcoming years. Applications should also
conrm:
- career stage and institutional aliation
- membership in SSE
- past attendance at Evolution conferences
Applicants must be members of SSE (join or renew
your membership here: http://bit.ly/joinSSE) and have
attended at least one Evolution conference in the past.
Many of the DC's initiatives are created and operated
with the DCs of our sister societies, the American Soci-
ety of Naturalists (ASN) and the Society for Systematic
Biologists (SSB). Past or ongoing eorts of the SSE DC
include:
- Development and administration of a climate survey
to assess inclusion and equity in evolutionary biology,January 1, 2022 EvolDir 79
in collaboration with ASN and SSB.
- Working closely with a diversity consultant to form
SSE's mission with respect to diversity, equity, and in-
clusion, to assess the inclusivity of SSE's policies and
practices, and to develop a strategic plan for making
SSE more supportive and inclusive moving forward.
- Applying for a grant to consult social scientists on best
practices for achieving equity in awarding
- Data collection and analysis regarding the demographic
composition of SSE
- Creation of guidelines on best practices for awards
procedures

ZuckerkandlAward Winner
This year, 2021 marks the third year in a row that the
reinstated Zuckerkandl Prize has been awarded. This
is an award for the top paper published in Journal of
Molecular Evolution to appear in a print issue during
the calendar year, as judged by a committee, in honor
of Founding Editor Emile Zuckerkandl. The award com-
mittee consisting of Michelle Meyer, Joshua Rest, and
Ashley Teufel was assembled and the entire editorial
board was polled for nominations to the committee.
Among the papers that were nominated, three received
particularly serious discussion from the committee. The
runner up papers are listed below and reect important
advances in molecular evolution. Brintnell et al. (2021)
presented a timely evolutionary study indicating thatSARS-CoV2 was preadapted to infect humans. Moyer
et al. (2021) presented a new tool for studying the
evolution of metabolic networks with promising utility
towards a greater understanding of the general rules of
the nature of metabolic capabilities and structures in
dierent organisms.
I am pleased to announce that \Pheromone gene diversi-
cation and the evolution of courtship glands in plethod-
ontid salamanders" by Herrboldt, Steen, McGouran,
and Bonett (Herrboldt et al., 2021) is the Zuckerkandl
Prize Award winner for 2021. This study integrates our
understanding of duplicate gene fates with comparative
salamander biology in showing how subfunctionaliza-
tion contributed to dierences in courtship glands in
dierent species, with implications for the genotype-
phenotype map of courtship dierences between species.
This integrative study brings together analysis from the
molecular and more organismal levels with transcrip-
tomic data to better understand lineage-specic biology.
Journal of Molecular Evolution is proud to congratulate
the authors on this work and the award.

EvolutionaryImmunogenetics
Postdoc: AMUPoznan Evolutionary Immunogenetics
Post-Doc in an NCN-funded project aiming to in-
vestigate coevolution at the level of genes between
Lime disease agent, Borrelia afzelli, and its rodent
host, is oered by Radwan lab at AMU (https://-
evobio.home.amu.edu.pl/). The candidate should hold
PhD degree in biological sciences or bioinformatics and
should have signicant publication record in the area of
evolutionary biology, molecular genetics or bioinformat-ics. The employment is oered for three years, starting
ideally in January 2021, but it is negotiable.
Interested candidates should send their cv via email to
the project leader Jacek Radwan (jradwan@amu.edu.pl),
who will provide further information about the project
and application procedure. Please apply before 30
November 2020.
Brief summary of the project: Hosts are under evolu-
tionary pressure to be able to ght infections, whereas
infectious organisms are under selection to evade host
immune system. This paradigm predicts co-evolution
of host immune systems and their targets in pathogens,
with both parties in a need for continuous adaptation
in order to keep up with the opponent - a dynamics
described as a Red Queen process. Such co-evolution
may have important consequences for several crucialJanuary 1, 2022 EvolDir 83
evolutionary processes the maintenance of sex, sexual
selection, speciation and evolution of virulence. Yet,
demonstrating that co-evolution is actually occurring
requires knowledge of interacting genes in both hosts
and parasites. This condition is fullled for Lime-disease
agent, the spirochete Borrelia and its mammalian hosts.
The project will test predictions of Red Queen hypothe-
sis, and will investigate its consequences for speciation
and epidemiology.

Postdoc: AMUPoznan QMULondon UEssex Experimen-
tal Evolution
Post-doc position in evolutionary biology is available for
three years, preferably starting February/March 2022
but subject to negotiations, in a project \Sex, aggres-
sion and ecology - how sexual selection alters popula-
tion dynamics?". This collaborative project is led by
Jacek Radwan (Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan),
Rob Knell (Queen Mary University, London) and Tom
Cameron (University of Essex), and is funded by Polish
National Science Centre (NCN).
Project summary: In recent years an increasing aware-
ness that sexual selection may play a crucial role in
larger scale processes such as adaptation to altered en-
vironments and population persistence has developed,
but empirical support for this role is extremely inconsis-
tent. The aim of the proposed project is to resolve this
inconsistencies by using a combination of simulation
modelling and laboratory experiments. Laboratory ex-
periments investigate the eects of sexual selection on a
variety of ecologically important variables and on popu-
lation dynamic behaviour. We will use an experimental
system that is uniquely suited for this purpose, the soil
mite Sancassania berlesei, which can be readily cultured
and manipulated in the lab and is male-dimorphic with
respect to sexually selected weapon. The proportion of
armoured, aggressive males in the population can be
easily manipulated experimentally, which allows varyingthe strength of sexual selection. We will test whether
(i) sexual selection interacts with population size in de-
termining population dynamics and persistence in face
of environmental population and (ii) whether sexual
selection aect carrying capacity and if it interacts in
this respect with environmental complexity. Theoretical
work will examine how the eects of dierent mating
systems impact on the overall eects of strong sexual
selection, and will explore the ecological eects of sexual
selection in a wide range of scenarios.
The post-doc will be will be responsible for the experi-
mental evolution part, but will also contribute to model
development. The candidate should hold PhD degree in
biological sciences and should have signicant achieve-
ments in evolutionary biology or ecology as documented
by publications in international scientic journals. S/he
should be able to work well as part of a team, have good
planning, analytical, statistical and writing skills. and
should be ready to work hard in the eld..
Interested candidates should send their CVs via email
to the project leader (jradwan@amu.edu.pl), who will
provide further information about the project and ap-
plication procedure.

Cambridge PDF PhD
CancerEvolutionInDogsAndDevils
The Transmissible Cancer Group at the University of
Cambridge, Department of Veterinary Medicine, is seek-
ing to appoint a Research Assistant or Postdoctoral
Research Associate to join a dynamic team studying the
evolution and host interactions of transmissible cancers
in dogs and Tasmanian devils. This is a xed-term
3-year position supported by a Wellcome research grant.
This post is expected to start on 1st May 2022 but there
is some exibility for an earlier or later start date.
Transmissible cancers are long-lived clonal lineages of
malignant cells that operate as infectious parasites,
spreading between individuals by the physical transfer
of living cancer cells. Among mammals, such diseases
have been described in only two species: dogs and Tas-
manian devils, and are spread by mating and biting,
respectively. These extraordinary cell lineages provide
an opportunity to study cancer evolution over the long-
term, and to investigate the interaction between cancer
cells and the allogeneic immune system. Furthering our
knowledge of these diseases may also shed light on their
transmission dynamics and inform conservation work.
This position is suited for someone with skills in com-
putational biology and an interest in cancer evolution
and tumour immunology. The role-holder will analyse
genome, transcriptome and single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) data from tumours belonging to transmissi-
ble cancer lineages. We will annotate genetic variants
and use these to understand past and ongoing muta-
tional and evolutionary processes, including the impact
of mutation on gene expression and tumour phenotypes.
Using scRNAseq data, we will seek to understand the
contribution of host cells to the tumour microenviron-
ment. By integrating data from hundreds of tumours,
our goal will be to understand how cancers exploit a
transmissible niche, and how the interaction between
cancer and immune system controls disease outcome.
Applicants should hold a Master's degree (Research As-
sistant) or PhD (Postdoctoral Research Associate) in86 EvolDir January 1, 2022
computational biology or a related discipline, and expe-
rience in genome analysis is preferable. The candidate
must value teamwork and collaboration, have good or-
ganisational and interpersonal skills, and should be able
to eectively manage their time. They will have the
opportunity to make their own original contribution to
the eld of study within the framework of the project.
If applying at the Research Assistant level it may be
possible for the role-holder to register as a PhD student.

Group of Ecological Genomics (Filip Kol a) Department
of Botany, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic
https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen We seek a highly
motivated, independent early career researcher inter-
ested in leading a research program within the context
of an ERC-funded project focused on the evolutionary
consequences of whole genome duplication addressed us-
ing available population genomic data of multiple plant
species (for details see below). The successful candidate
will join the team of Ecological Genomics at Charles
University in Prague (Czech Republic, EU), lead by
Filip Kol a (https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen) and
will work in close collaboration with our partner labs
focused on evolutionary genomics lead by Tanja Slotte
(Stockholm University, Sweden) and Levi Yant (Univer-
sity of Nottingham, UK). The start date is negotiable,
from early 2022.
**Requirements - keen interest in leading an indepen-
dent research program within a highly collaborative
research group - experience in handling large scale high-
throughput sequence data - a strong background in
structural, statistical, and/or population genomics -
PhD in evolutionary biology, genetics, bioinformatics,
or related elds (previous experience in leading an inde-
pendent postdoctoral project is advantageous, but not
required)
**We oer - competitive monthly salary of 2,400 EUR
(note that average monthly gross salary in the Czech Re-
public was ~1,500 EUR in mid-2021 and living expenses
are generally lower in CZ than in western Europe) -
work in a young, dynamic and international environ-
ment, situated in an inspiring city centre - involvement

ignated Junior Researcher projects within The Czech
Science Foundation) and international funding schemes
(e.g. Marie Curie, EMBO fellowship)
**Project details Whole genome duplication (WGD,
polyploidization) is a dramatic genome-wide mutation
whose ubiquity across eukaryotes suggests an adaptive
benet, although the underlying mechanism remains
unknown. In the project, the successful applicant will
test the hypothesis that WGD promotes accumulation
of potentially benecial variation in general and when
facing novel environmental challenges in particular. The
project will build on our research in Arabidopsis arenosa
that demonstrated increased potential of its natural
polyploid populations to accumulate adaptive varia-
tion (see doi: 10.1038/s41559-019-0807-4, Nature Eco
& Evo.; doi: 10.1073/pnas.2022713118 PNAS and doi:
10.1038/s41467-021-25256-5 Nature Comms.). The can-
didate will extend well-beyond this system to additional
mixed-ploidy species to discern the generality in how se-
lection aects polyploid genomes. The core of the analy-
sis will involve available population-level short-read data
of ten plant species; long-read data for several species
are also available for validation. For overall info on the
Starting ERC project see https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/-

Lausanne AdaptiveEvolution
2 postdoctoral position Lausanne: Theory in behavior,
life-history, and adaptive evolution
Two postdoctoral positions for 1 up to 5 years in be-
havior, life-history and human evolution are open in
the research group of Laurent Lehmann at the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution of the University of Lau-92 EvolDir January 1, 2022
sanne (https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home/menuguid/-
people/group-leaders/prof-laurent-lehmann.html).
We study adaptive evolution from a mathematical and
computational point of view with an attempt to shed
light on the following type of related questions:
How do decision-making systems evolve? Should be-
havior be genetically driven, acquired by social learn-
ing, or is free choice of action favored bv selection and
what are then individual preferences? How did the
human life-history evolve? What is the role of cumula-
tive culture and intergenerational transfers in shaping
life-history schedules? How can large-scale stratied so-
cieties emerge from small-scale egalitarian ones? Is this
the result of an increase in the technologies of produc-
tion and exchange (invention of agriculture and trading)
or in the technology of appropriation (intensication of
warfare)?
All these questions pertain to formalizing evolutionary
dynamics in structured populations under the action
and interaction of dierent processes often occurring at
dierent time scales and thus connect broadly to several
open theoretical questions at that heart of ecology and
evolution.
Applicants with a strong interest in these research ques-
tions and/or adaptive dynamics in general are encour-
aged to apply. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in a
relevant area (e.g. evolutionary biology, economics, an-
thropology, physics, mathematics), with strong math-
ematical and/or computing skills, and a vivid interest
in fundamental research. Having a good knowledge of
stochastic process theory and/or optimal control theory
is an asset.
Inquiries and applications should be sent rst to lau-
rent.lehmann@unil.ch and then to receive full consider-
ation must eventually also be uploaded online through
the University of Lausanne recruitment platform:https:/-
/bit.ly/3IdTno3 where more administrative details on
the positions can be found. Applications should include
a CV, a statement of research interests explaining why
you replied to this job oer, and contact details of 2
referees.
Starting date is negotiable, from April 2022 onwards.

AdaptiveDivergenceInFissionYeast
Post-doc position on adaptive divergence in ssion yeast
at LMU Munich
A 2-year postdoc position in experimental evolution is
available in the research group of Jochen Wolf at LMU
Munich, Germany.
BACKGROUND Adaptive divergence is key to the for-
mation of new species by means of natural selection.
Under geographical isolation, adaptive divergence read-
ily results as a by-product of ecological specialization.
Under conditions of gene ow, however, the situation
is less clear. Gene ow might break up benecial gene
combinations and promote generalist phenotypes, but
on the other hand can introduce novel variation that
facilitate adaptation. Due to the complex interactions
between local adaptation, life history trade-os, and ge-
netic interactions, determining the mechanisms leading
to divergence in natural systems is challenging. Con-
trolled, replicated evolution experiments are a promising
way to generate insight on the genetic basis of adaptive
divergence in the context of gene ow.
THE PROJECT We have been running an experimen-
tal evolution study for ~seven years using the haploid
ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (1). In this
experiment, we vary the amount of migration while ap-
plying disruptive selection. The rst analyses of the
132 replicate populations after 53 asexual generations
showed divergence to be strongest in allopatry as would
be expected. Yet, divergent ecological adaptation arose
also with the highest level of gene-ow (2). The stored
longitudinal collection of population samples (currently
at sexual generation ~200), which can be revived any
time, is a great resource and fun playground for any
evolutionary geneticist. Questions to address include
the genetic basis of evolutionary parallelism, the evo-
lution of reproductive isolation (incl. reinforcement),
evolution of trade-os, the eect of genetic constraints
on evolvability, etc.
QUALIFICATIONS The successful applicant holds a
PhD degree and has experience in microbiological lab
work, ideally with specialization in yeast-genetics. A
solid background in population genetics, experimen-
tal evolution, quantitative genetics and/or statistical
modelling (e.g. linear mixed models) is a clear asset. Re-January 1, 2022 EvolDir 93
search environment The Wolf lab applies an integrative
approach to explore micro-evolutionary processes and
genetic mechanisms underlying species divergence, adap-
tation and genome evolution (3, 4). Using large-scale
genomic approaches combined with eld and lab-based
experiments, we characterize genetic diversity within
and between populations (5) and assess its relation-
ship to phenotypic divergence (6-8). This project falls
square into the main interests of the lab and will be
performed in close collaboration with the Nieuwenhuis
lab. The Nieuwenhuis lab uses ssion yeast to study
the evolution of divergence at sexual reproduction, and
its consequences for the genetic architecture, studying

project aims to study the fundamentals of a key behav-
ior of social insects, brood care. Clonal raider ant larvae
have clear eects on worker behavior and physiology,
and the project aims to identify the cues (chemical, be-
havioral) driving those eects. We are therefore looking
for a team member with a strong background in chemical
ecology or behavioral biology. Experience working with
social insects, designing behavioral assays and analyz-
ing behavior computationally, and/or bioassay-guided
fractionation and compound identication are a denite
plus. Candidates must have excellent verbal and written
communication skills, a publication record, and a track
record of addressing scientic questions in an innovative

Mathematical models of cooperation in crops
A post-doctoral position is available for 12 months
(with possible extension) starting next spring in Mont-
pellier (France), as fully described here : https://-
bit.ly/3nTN7IJ (https://emploi.cnrs.fr/Ores/CDD/-
UMR5554-FRAROU-005/Default.aspx?lang=EN for di-
rect access to english version).
This post-doc is part of the ANR-funded SCOOP
project (https://umr-agap.cirad.fr/en/recherche/-
projets-de-recherche/scoop-cooperation-chez-les-
plantes-cultivees), led by H el ene Fr eville (AGAP,
INRAE), which will use a combination of theory and
experiments to identify above- and below-ground traits
involved in social interactions and their associated
cooperative phenotypes in crops (with durum wheat
as an experimental model), as well as cooperative
alleles. One aim of the project is to provide practical
guidelines for breeders and farmers to design selection
schemes that promote plant cooperation and optimize
crop yield in high-density agrosystems. The post-doc
will be supervised by F. Rousset (CNRS, evolution
of social behaviour) at the Institut des Sciences de
l'Evolution (ISEM), and will benet from the expertise
of dierent project members, including S Gandon
(CNRS, development of kin selection models) and H
Fr eville (INRAE, experiments on kin selection in crops).
The post-doc will develop models to assess the ability
and eciency of dierent selection schemes to select for
cooperative phenotypes. Previous work by our group
(Montazeaud et al 2020) has investigated this question
by considering the evolution of plant height in response
to competition for light. This theoretical framework will
be extended in two directions: (i) we will consider the
coevolution between height and shape. This evolution
will be constrained by trade-os with seed production
(in the absence of competition there is an optimal height
and shape that maximizes yield) but also by potential
correlations between these two traits constraining plant
architecture. This model will predict the impact of an
increase of crop density on these two traits and on yield.
We will manipulate relatedness and the level of selec-
tion among groups in order to identify practices that
maximize yield; (ii) we will account for the change of
architecture during growth, and the ability of plants to
adjust their development in response to the developmentof their neighbors. Yield will thus depend on the plastic
response in height to the social partners, and the plastic
response in shape.

Postdoctoral positions in Drosophila evolutionary ge-
nomics/genetics/speciation
The Eric Lai lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center, NYC (https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/-
labs/eric-lai) has positions open at postdoctoral or sta
scientist levels to investigate RNA-related mechanisms
during Drosophila evolution. Our group uses integrated
approaches to study several areas in post-transcriptional
regulation, but we have particular interest in alternative
mRNA processing and small RNAs.
1. What are the biological roles of RNAi and siRNAs?
While critical tools for experimental gene suppression,
their endogenous utilities are less clear. Our recent stud-
ies reveal that RNAi represses specic targets in testis,
and that this relevant to meiotic drive and sex chromo-
some conicts. Surprisingly, since these genomic battles
are evolutionarily short-lived, the major insect model D.
melanogaster is a far less compelling setting for RNAi
biology than many non-model fruities. In unpublishedJanuary 1, 2022 EvolDir 99
eorts, we established a broad foundation on the evo-
lutionary dynamics of RNAi substrates, novel genetic
tools to study the roles of RNAi in meiotic conict, and
knowledge of numerous RNAi targets that manipulate
gamete distribution via unknown mechanisms. These
studies are poised to reveal molecular mechanisms that
mediate speciation.
2. How plastic is RNA processing across evolution?
From our work in D. melanogaster, we dened several
landscapes of mRNA isoforms (eg splicing and alterna-
tive 3' UTRs) and short RNAs (miRNA/siRNA/piRNA)
and their underlying molecular pathways. While many
are conserved, we nd subsets that evolve rapidly. By
studying these using genomics and biochemistry, we
gain insights into strategies that mediate biogenesis of
alternative isoforms and de novo genes. On the other
hand, such evolutionary exibility may not necessarily
be desirable, and we also have evidence that de novo
transcripts and isoforms may trigger regulatory defense
mechanisms. These studies will reveal fundamental prin-
ciples that generate tissue-specic transcriptomes, and
purify them of unwanted transcripts while permitting
species-specic genes to emerge.
We welcome applications from candidates with experi-
ence in molecular genetics, evolutionary genomics, or
both. These projects currently focus on ies, but we
seek to extend principles into mammals. We have an
interactive, multidisciplinary, and collaborative team
engaged in diverse topics in regulatory biology, and
Sloan Kettering provides a vibrant research community
committed to inclusivity and diversity.
Positions are currently available, funded by a new 4-yr
NIH-R01 grant, and include nearby subsidized housing
and benets. Please provide CV, motivation letter and

search on an NSF-funded project examining the genetic
basis of mimetic color diversity in bees. The postdoc
will lead a project examining how transcriptomes shift
with the repeated acquisition of mimetic color variants
spanning a clade of North American bumble bees. The
exceptional diversity and convergence in this system
provides an opportunity to examine the dierent ge-
netic routes to an adaptive phenotype and to connect
micro- to macroevolutionary processes through exam-100 EvolDir January 1, 2022
ining patterns of inheritance of adaptive alleles across
lineages.
The project involves eld collection of bumble bee queens
in the western United States, rearing of colonies, de-
velopmental staging and dissections, transcriptome se-
quencing, and comparative analysis of transcriptome
variation across several bumble bee morphs and species.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in a biology-related eld,
have a strong record of research involving both molec-
ular and bioinformatic techniques, and an interest in
evolutionary genetics/evo-devo. Experience in working

The Hamilton Lab (http://jillahamilton.com/-
index.html) at The Pennsylvania State University
is seeking to hire a postdoctoral research associate
to contribute to a conservation genomics research
program on ex situ and living collections of Oregon
ash. The project includes a large collaboration with
the US Forest Service, Huntington Botanic Garden,
and Oregon Department of Forestry. The researcher
will contribute to range wide eld sampling for ex
situ conservation and process tissue for landscape
genomic and gene-environment analyses (GEA) in
Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia). One major goal of
the project is to create a 'genetic passport' for ex situ
seed collections of Oregon ash. In addition to range
wide sampling, genomic screening of living collections
maintained for EAB-screening and genecology will be
used to assess ne-scale variation within and among
families for development of seed orchards and breeding
programs. The post-doctoral position is highly interdis-
ciplinary, combining population and landscape genomic
analyses to quantify genetic variation maintained
within ex situ collections, will use GEA analyses to
estimate genetic-environmental associations necessary
to establishing seed-transfer guidance across climatic
gradients, and contribute to genomic screening of
families to pair with EAB-resistance phenotyping.
The major goal of this research will be to build new
methods in conservation genomics taking advantage
of genomics-driven monitoring of ex situ and living
collections for species at risk that will be necessary for
conservation and development of resources necessary to
establish breeding programs.
The position requires a Ph.D. in forestry, evolutionary
biology, population genomics, landscape genomics, bioin-
formatics, or a related eld, and the applicant must be
able to provide evidence that all requirements have been
met for the completion of the PhD. prior to the eective
date of hire. Familiarity with analyzing RAD-seq data
and expertise using bioinformatic tools to infer genomic
structure is necessary, as well as experience using Unix
or Linux environments. The postdoctoral fellow will
be expected to contribute to eld collections, analyze
genomic, phenotypic and climatic datasets, lead prepa-
ration and publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts,
present ndings from the research project, and con-January 1, 2022 EvolDir 101
tribute to outreach associated with the project. In
addition, there will be ample opportunity to pursue
research questions besides those of the particular study.
Interested applicants should submit a cover letter de-

StockholmU EvolutionaryGenomics
**Evolution of a classic supergene - Carl Tryggers Post-
doctoral Fellowship**
A two-year Carl Tryggers Postdoctoral Fellowship is
now available to work on supergene evolution in the
Slotte lab at Stockholm University.
*Project* Supergenes are sets of loci that can maintain
adaptive combinations of traits, because they are inher-
ited as a unit. They are responsible for a wide range
of balanced polymorphisms, yet our understanding of
their origin and evolution remains incomplete. Distyly
is a balanced oral polymorphism that is governed by
a supergene. In this project, we aim to study molecu-
lar evolution of the distyly supergene in Linum (wild
axseed species), a plant system that is ideal for this
purpose. As part of an ongoing ERC-funded project,
we have generated high-quality genome assemblies from
several Linum species and population genomic data that
will now be used to comprehensively study the evolution
of the S-locus region.
*Main responsibilities* The Carl Tryggers postdoctoral
fellow will lead and conduct evolutionary genomic analy-
ses with particular focus on patterns of molecular evolu-
tion at the distyly supergene and comparative genomic
analyses to pinpoint the role of structural variation for
recombination suppression.
*Qualications* The fellowship is for two years, funded
by a stipend from the Carl Tryggers foundation. Ideally
we are looking for a candidate who can start in the
spring of 2022, but the starting date can be discussed.
According to the rules of the Tryggers foundation, the
PhD degree must be less than six years old, and appli-
cants must receive nal approval by the foundation.
Applicants are required to hold a PhD, preferably in
evolutionary genetics, population genetics, compara-
tive genomics, bioinformatics, or related topics. The
candidate should have proven experience in genomic
analyses with an evolutionary genetic focus and very
good writing skills. Candidates should be able to work
independently, as well as together with team members,
and exhibit drive and motivation for the research task.
Excellent prociency in English (the working language
of the group) is required.104 EvolDir January 1, 2022
*Environment* The Carl Tryggers postdoctoral fellow
will be based in the research group of Dr. Tanja Slotte
(http://tanjaslottelab.se) and will join an already ex-
isting group of highly motivated and skilled postdocs
and PhD students. In terms of work environment, we
have access to oce space and fully equipped facili-
ties for molecular genetic lab work and plant work at
the Dept. of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences
and high-performance computing infrastructure at UPP-
MAX (http://www.uppmax.uu.se).
*Application* To apply, please email a pdf with a cover
letter motivating your interest and suitability for the
fellowship, a CV including contact information to 2-
3 reference persons, a publication list and a copy of
your PhD diploma directly to tanja.slotte@su.se. Please
specify \Carl Tryggers postdoc 2022" in the subject
header.
The fellowship will remain open until lled, with appli-
cation review starting on January 17th, 2022.

HistoricalEpidemiology
long-term postdoc position in Belgium on historical
epidemiology of vector-borne diseases
The University of Antwerp and the Royal Museum of
Central Africa (Belgium) oer a combined position (10%
junior professor, 90% senior researcher) for a postdoc in
Biology, Geography or a related discipline with a back-
ground in epidemiology, ecology, parasitology and/or
distribution modelling. The position is of indeterminate
duration but salary is secured for at least 10 years.
RECORDED: Reconstructing disease dynamics in Cen-
tral Africa using historical museum collections and
archives
The past century has seen unprecedented changes in nat-
ural biotopes due to human activities, in Africa perhaps
even more than elsewhere. This has aected the distri-
bution and dynamics of infectious diseases, particularly
zoonotic infections, transmitted from wildlife to humans.
In addition, changes in human demography, agriculture
and other human activities in the environment, includ-
ing health care interventions, have also changed the
disease dynamics. Understanding the relativecontribu-
tion of these factors may help in predicting what the
eects can be of future environmental changesto the
spread of diseases. The scientist we are looking for
will use museum collections and historical archives to
retrospectively study the impact of environmental and
anthropogenic changes on vector and disease dynamics.
Despite its enormous potential, this 'unexplored her-
itage' is vastly underused in epidemiological research.
This prole will combine longitudinal series of vector
collections and zoonotic disease carriers, with historicalarchives such as medical records, aerial pictures and
scientic publications. By taking a multidisciplinary
approach, combining ecology, geography, modelling and
semi-quantitative methods, the changes in the presence,
diversity and distribution of pathogens, vectors and
animal reservoirs can be documented and related to
changes in 1) human demography, 2) climate, and 3)
land cover and land use on the spread of vector-borne
and zoonotic diseases. By including socio-ecological
studies and historical records of disease control eorts,
lessons can be learned in order to improve current health
policies ('historical epidemiology').
For a start, the research will focus on three vector-borne
diseases that are strongly aected by environmental and
anthropogenic change and that fallwithin the expertise
of and/or historical documentation at both institutes
schistosomiasis, sleeping sickness and bubonic plague.

the Behavioural Ecology and Evolution Lab at the Uni-
versity of Cyprus. One position is for a bioinformatician
focusing on RNAseq, IsoSeq and genome-wide associa-
tion studies of avian traits associated with behaviour.
The second is for a researcher with expertise in popu-
lation genomics, demographic inference and statistical
analyses. They are to work on two new projects in-
volving collaborations with Dr. Bridgett vonHoldt at
Princeton University and Dr. Andrea Fulgione at Max
Planck Institute of Plant Breeding Research.
The positions are for an initial 12 months, extendable up
to 24 months, with a salary range of 30,522 - 41,641 euro
per annum, less employer and employee contributions.
The bioinformatician will work primarily on the Cyprus
Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) funded
project \Leveraging ancestry to investigate the genomics
of song and colour in birds"
The project focuses on a hybrid zone in Southern
Africa between yellow-fronted and red-fronted tinker-
birds in which it aims to identify genes and regulatory
regions associated with key phenotypic traits, including
feather colour and song. It involves admixture map-
ping, genome-wide association studies and RNAseq and
IsoSeq based studies to investigate gene expression and
expertise in some of those methods as well as in genomic
library preparation would be desired.
Some experience with analysis of avian genomes would
be helpful but not essential. The position is based at
the University of Cyprus, in Nicosia, but is planned to
involve a month-long visit to Princeton to work closely
with Dr. vonHoldt. The candidate will also be involved
towards manuscript preparation and dissemination of
results in scientic conferences.
The postdoctoral researcher with expertise in popula-
tion genomics will work primarily on the RIF funded
project \Continent-wide genomics of hybridisation and
speciation"
Here the focus is on establishing the history of isola-
tion, divergence and gene ow among populations of
tinkerbirds across sub-Saharan Africa, and in particular
across several contact zones using whole genome rese-110 EvolDir January 1, 2022
quencing and ddRAD sequencing. The project involves

A postdoctoral research position in DNA metabarcoding
of sand-dwelling beetle assemblages is available at the
University of Cyprus.
# POSITION: Two-year postdoctoral position at the
Molecular Ecology & Evolution Lab of the University
of Cyprus, starting 1st of March 2022. The project is
coordinated by Dr. Anna Papadopoulou (University
of Cyprus) and will be developed in collaboration with
Prof. Alfried P. Vogler (The Natural History Museum,
London).
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION Coastal sand dune
ecosystems are highly dynamic environments, due to
their unstable substrate and their constant change in
response to wind, waves, tides and sea-level uctuations.
Habitat instability has been proposed to aect dispersal
propensity and/or extinction-recolonisation rates, and
thus to play an important role in population dynam-
ics, but empirical evidence remains limited. Previous
research of our group has identied low genetic diversity
and population bottlenecks in some sand-obligate beetlespecies. This project will aim to assess the demographic
eects of habitat instability at the assemblage level. For
this purpose, we will sample systematically ten sand
dune ecosystems of dierent sizes and grades of distur-
bance along the coast of Cyprus and we will apply whole-
organism community mtDNA metabarcoding with rig-
orous read ltering protocols to obtain haplotype-level
data (i.e., Amplicon Sequence Variants; ASVs) for each
of the sampled beetle taxa. Based on the ASV data,
we will estimate intrapopulation genetic diversity and
metrics of population dierentiation for each species
and we will apply comparative phylogeographic analy-
ses to test for concerted demographic responses across
sand-dwelling taxa of dierent traits (e.g., sand-obligate
vs. habitat generalists, ightless vs. winged taxa).
# RESPONSIBILITIES: 1. Participation in eld sam-
pling of sand-dune ecosystems and sample processing.
2. Sanger sequencing for selected voucher specimens.
3. DNA metabarcoding library preparation from bulk
Coleoptera samples. 4. Bioinformatic analyses of
metabarcoding data at the species (OTUs) and hap-
lotype levels (ASVs) 4. Comparative phylogeographic
and population genetic analyses based on the generated
ASVs dataset. 5. Publication of results.
# REQUIREMENTS: Applicants are required to have:
1. PhD in Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Ecology
or related elds. 2. Experience in DNA metabarcod-
ing methods, including relevant wet-lab protocols and
bioinformatic analyses. 3. Experience in Linux/Unix
and common statistical environments (e.g., R, Python).
4. Excellent oral and written communication skills in
English.
Additional desirable skills: 1. Previous work on insects
(preferably Coleoptera). 2. Experience in eld sam-
pling. 3. Experience in phylogeography and population
genetics.
# APPLICATION: Applicants should provide the fol-
lowing documents (preferably as a single pdf le): 1.
letter of interest (up to 1 page) 2. short CV (up to 2
pages) 3. contact information of two academic referees
Interested candidates should submit their applications

Postoctoral researcher (w/m/d)
to work on the (molecular) phenology of tropical tree
species and, in general, on the evolutionary ecology of
trees.
* Application deadline: 24.01.2022 * Start-date: At the
earliest possible date. * Fulltime position
Full announcement can be found here: https://uni-
freiburg.de/universitaet/jobs/00002005/ The successful
applicant will be involved in the DFG funded Emmy
Noether project on \Phenology of tropical tree species
- environmental cues, molecular mechanisms, and con-
sequences for plant-animal interactions". The project
focuses on identifying climatic cues that trigger pheno-
logical transitions in four neotropical tree species. We
will collect phenological data with an automated cam-
era system and link this information to high-resolution
climatic data. In addition, we will investigate the molec-
ular phenology of the trees by targeting changes in the
expression of owering time genes. Moreover, we will
study how plant-animal interactions, specically polli-
nation and herbivory, are inuenced by the timing and
degree of synchrony within tree populations. Data col-
lection in Southern Ecuador at the Estaci on Cient ca
San Francisco and in a dry forest site at Las Arenillas
will take place from 2022 - 2024. We are now looking for
a postdoctoral researcher that will support the coordina-
tion of eld and lab work with the two Ph.D. students,
supervise BSc and MSc students, and carry out his/her
own investigations in the framework of this project.
In addition, the successful applicant should establish
her/his own research projects in the context of the evolu-
tionary ecology of tree species. Further, the postdoctoral
researcher will support the working group in research,
teaching, supervision of BSc and MSc students, and ad-
ministrative tasks. The position comes with a teaching
load of 4 semester hours. Courses should preferentially
be taught in German.
Your prole You have an MSc in biology, ecology, en-
vironmental science, or similar elds and completed a

you have already gained experience in a postdoctoral
position. You have prior experience with eldwork inthe neotropics and are able to communicate with local
eld workers, NGOs, and authorities in Spanish. Ideally,
you have prior experience with research projects with
tree ecology, phenology, plant-animal interactions, or
population genetics. Prior experience with laboratory
work (DNA/RNA extraction, qPCR) is advantageous.
You have good communication and team skills, and a
meticulous way of working. The ability to work in a
team and under physically and mentally demanding
conditions of eld research in a tropical rainforest is
crucial. Specically, eldwork will include tree climbing
and the topography of the study area is very demand-
ing. Thus, eldwork requires strong physical tness and
previous experience with tropical eldwork is desirable.
Experience in tree climbing would be benecial.
Further, we expect good knowledge in data handling
and statistical data analysis (preferable in R) as well
as the capability to interpret the results and excellent
writing skills which should be proven by own scientic
publications. Previous teaching experience is benecial.

Aarhus (DK), and Aberdeen (UK), with the aim to un-
derstand the eect of insect decline on genetic diversity.
In this specic project the successful post-doctoral can-
didate is expected to use existing time-series genomic
data/samples available for the Glanville fritillary butter-
y (Melitaea cinxia) in the ~Aland islands, SW Finland,
to examine both spatial and temporal patterns of ge-
netic variation in relation to population demographics,
climate and land use. Alternatively, or in addition, ge-
netic sampling of dierent buttery species with varying
population trends across land-use gradient accompanied
with historical museum specimens can be used for a
more comparative genetic analyses. The centre will
further establish relationships between genetic diversity
and organismal performance, and develop a predictive
modelling framework integrating genetic, ecological and
environmental eects on insect population genetics. The
research spans several topics in ecological and evolu-
tionary research using dierent molecular methods and
statistical and process-based modelling.
At the University of Helsinki, the research group of
M. Saastamoinen is also part of the Research Centre
for Ecological Change (www.helsinki./rec) and the
Research Programme of Organismal and Evolutionary
Biology at the Faculty of Biological and Environmental
Sciences. Thus the post doc will have an opportunity
to interact within the dynamic and highly internationalresearch environments, with vast expertise in questions
related to biodiversity change using long-term ecological
monitoring data and spatial statistical analyses. The
successful candidate will participate in planning and
potentially collecting samples, analyse the genetic data,
and lead the writing of the resulting manuscript(s). The
candidate is expected to have a strong background in
evolutionary ecology, more specically population or
landscape genetics. The successful applicant should
have completed a PhD in evolutionary ecology or ge-
netics, or a related eld, and have strong statistical or
bioinformatics skills. We seek candidates with excellent
written and verbal communication skills, and the ability
to conceive, execute and complete research projects, and
to think independently and creatively. The post doc

UMuenster BehaviouralEvolution
The Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity at the
University of M?nster, Germany, is seeking to ll the
position of a
Postdoctoral Research Associate? Wissenschaftliche/r
Mitarbeiter/in (salary level TV-L E 13, 100%)? from
the earliest possible date. The position is within the
externally funded project SFB/TRR 212. We are oer-
ing a xed-term full-time position until 31 December
2025 corresponding to the duration of the project.
Your tasks:? The position is part of the Collaborative
Research Centre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled ?A Novel
Synthesis of Individualisation across Behaviour, Ecology
and Evolution: Niche Choice, Niche Conformance,
Niche Construction (NChttps://www.uni-bielefeld.de/-
fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/verbuende/sfb nc3/3)?
The project focuses on the genetic, epigenetic and
transcriptomic basis of social niche construction during
colony founding. Individual Pogonomyrmex californicusJanuary 1, 2022 EvolDir 117
ant queens can choose to start a new colony alone
(haplometrosis) or they can join or accept other
co-founding queens (pleometrosis). During the rst two
weeks of colony founding, co-founding queens interact
in multiple ways and so construct their individualized
social niche. They either accept additional queens
or they evict/kill them. Matched interactions, where
pleometrotic queens interact with each other, lead to a
tness gain whereas mismatched interactions, where
haplometrotic and pleometrotic queens interact, lead to
a tness loss (for one or both). The frequency of these
alternative founding strategies varies within and among
subpopulations. The rst funding period revealed the
genomic and genetic architecture of this social niche
polymorphism. In the second funding period, we will
focus on three aims.
1. Conrming and experimentally testing candidate
genes and epigenetic mechanisms (histone modication
and DNA methylation), that we identied in the rst
funding period.? 2. Develop a generalized evolutionary
framework/model that takes into account the relation be-
tween genotype, phenotype, individualized social niche
and tness.? 3. Understand why colony founding above
a certain number of cofounding pleometrotic queens will
always fail. Is this a constraint (division of labour) or an
adaptation (spitefulness) in the context of the evolution
of pleometrosis.
The successful candidate will conduct behavioural eld
and laboratory studies in cooperation with Prof Jen-
nifer Fewell (Arizona State University) in Arizona and
California. The secondary emphasis will be on transcrip-
tomic, genomic and epigenetic studies using a variety of
methods (dsRNAi, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq?
and pharmacological interventions). Hence practical fa-
miliarity and experience with some genomic techniques
and bioinformatic tools is required (ideally demonstrated
through publications).
Our expectations:? The successful candidate will be a
highly motivated scientist, interested in interdisciplinary
work in the framework of the NC3 network. They will
have a doctoral degree (or a comparable qualication)
in biology, preferentially with a focus on evolution, be-
havioural ecology, sociobiology, genomics, epigenetics or
another related eld. They will also have a background,
and ideally some postdoctoral experience, in at least
two of the following areas: working with live insects,
molecular lab skills, genomics/transcriptomics and bioin-
formatics. They will have excellent communication skills
and be able to work both independently and as part of
a multidisciplinary team. The working language of the
Institute and the lab is English, and good prociency in
spoken and written English is a requirement. Germanlanguage skills are not a requirement, but a willingness
to learn is desirable.
Advantages for you:? The Institute for Evolution and
Biodiversity provides a stimulating research environment
with a number of scientic groups researching diverse
topics centred on dierent aspects of evolution. As a
part of the Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TRR
212 the project will involve intensive collaboration with
consortium partners at the Universities of M?nster and
Bielefeld.
The University of M?nster is an equal opportunity em-
ployer and is committed to increasing the proportion of
women academics. Consequently, we actively encourage
applications by women. Female candidates with equiva-
lent qualications and academic achievements will be
preferentially considered within the framework of the
legal possibilities.
The University of M?nster is committed to employing
more sta with disabilities. Candidates with recognised
severe disabilities who have equivalent qualications
are given preference in hiring decisions, although some
restrictions related to the access to eld sites may apply.
Positions can generally be lled as part-time positions
if there are no compelling work-related reasons against
doing so.

The Evolutionary Genetics and Genomics group at
BIOPOLIS/CIBIO-InBIO is currently hiring a postdoc
researcher in evolutionary and functional genomics to
work on the genomics of colouration in birds. This
position is open in the context of a European Re-
search Council Consolidator Grant for project \The
Genetic, Cellular, and Photonic Mechanisms of Avian
Structural Colouration". This project seeks to de-
cipher the genetic and cellular basis of structural
colours in birds, using an innovative approach that
merges techniques and expertise in the elds of ge-
netics and genomics, cell and molecular biology, and
photonics. The successful candidate will work collab-
oratively with members of the EVOLGEN group and
directly with the group leader Miguel Carneiro (https:/-
/scholar.google.pt/citations?user=onCfzJ4AAAAJ).
EVOLGEN brings together researchers broadly inter-
ested in evolutionary change and in the genetic deter-
minants underlying the immense biological diversity in
nature. Our ultimate goal is to map phenotypic varia-
tion to the gene level. Equipped with this information
we aim to shed light on the mutational mechanisms
explaining simple and complex trait variation, therefore
contributing to answer questions of general interest in122 EvolDir January 1, 2022
biology associated with multiple evolutionary processes,
such as speciation, sexual selection, adaptation, or do-
mestication. Our research integrates population genetics
and genomics to study genome-wide patterns of genetic
variation in both natural and domesticated populations,
together with genetic crosses and a diverse array of
molecular biology, physiology, and functional genomic
tools for experimental validation of the main ndings
and to compellingly map genotype onto phenotype.
| General requirements:
- Strong experience in the analysis of genomic datasets:
preference will be given to candidates that have ex-
perience with analysis of whole- genome sequencing,
RNA-sequencing, single cell omics, among other func-
tional genomic tools - An interest and prior experience
in evolutionary biology and related areas - Excellent ver-
bal and written communication skills in English - Good

We seek a Postdoc to join a project examining the
genetic and ecological mechanisms behind adaptive pop-
ulation dierentiation in plants, and the capacity for
adaptive evolution in natural populations of the plant
model organism Arabidopsis thaliana in response to
environmental change. The research will be conducted
within the framework of an international research col-
laboration. The goals are to identify QTL (quantitative
trait loci) contributing to local adaptation and to key
traits involved in adaptation, to characterize the eects,
genetic basis and geographic distribution of QTL alle-January 1, 2022 EvolDir 123
les, and to examine whether adaptive evolution in local
populations is constrained by trade-os and pleiotropy,
and/or the xation of deleterious mutations. One focus
will be on the genetic basis and adaptive signicance
of variation in owering time. Duties include the estab-
lishment and monitoring of experiments in the eld and
under controlled conditions in the lab, QTL-mapping,
data analysis, and the preparation of manuscripts for
publication. Specic subprojects can be tailored to the
skills and interests of the successful candidate.
We are looking for a candidate with a keen interest in
population genetics, genomics, QTL-mapping, evolu-
tionary ecology and/or ecophysiology. Prociency in
English is a requirement.
The successful postdoc candidate should have a PhD
completed within 3 years of the application deadline
(reasons such as prolonged periods of illness and parental
leave can motivate a longer period). The postdoc posi-

Dear All,
We have a research opportunity open at the University
of St Andrews' Centre for Biological Diversity Biodiver-
sity (CBD), School of Biology working in the research
team of Carolin Kosiol.
We are seeking a motivated and creative postdoctoral
researcher for a project \PoMoSelect: Disentangling
modes of selection" funded by the BBSRC. Recent se-
quencing of genomes of closely related species and of
many individuals from the same species enables the
study of speciation and the inference of the history
of populations. Standard phylogenetic methods re-
duce entire populations to single points in genotypic
space by modelling evolution as a process in which
a single gene mutates along the branches of a phy-
logeny. The Kosiol group has developed new approaches,
called polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models (PoMo,
Borges et al., Genetics 2019, Schrempf et al., JTB 2016,
DeMaio et al., Syst Biol 2015) for species tree estima-
tion. We envisage developing new theory and software
to tackle the problem of balancing selection.
You will be part of a team developing new methods
that investigate the role of balancing selection. This
will involve theoretical work as well as software im-
plementation and the analysis and interpretation of
high-throughput molecular and genomics data.
This post will suit a candidate who can think exibly
and implement new software. Ideally, the candidate
should have solid grasp of programming languages (eg.
C, C++, Java, Python, R), but a desire to extend their
capabilities into new areas and methods is highly desir-
able and there will be many opportunities to develop
specic skills. An interest in phylogenetics and popula-
tion genomics is a plus.
You will have the opportunity to publish rst author
papers, contribute as a co-author, and present your
work internally and at international conferences. You
must be able to independently manage your work, meet
deadlines, and prepare internal reports and draft publi-126 EvolDir January 1, 2022
cations. You will have good communication skills. This
is an outstanding opportunity to develop your research
skills, ask exciting scientic questions and drive forward
novel research at the cutting edge.
Applications should include:
(i) A cover letter expressing your interest in the position
(ii) a current CV
(iii) the names and contact details of three referees.

UVermont InsecticideResistance
Application deadline: December 15, 2021
Postdoctoral Researcher on transgenerational epigenetic
inheritance of insecticide resistance
A postdoctoral position is available in the Insect Agroe-
cology and Evolution Lab in the Department of Plant
and Soil Science at the University of Vermont (UVM),
led by Prof. Yolanda Chen, in collaboration with Prof.
Sean Schoville at the University of Wisconsin (UW),
Prof. Stephanie McKay (UVM) and Prof. Russell
Groves (UW).
Summary: Agricultural insect pests show a remarkable
ability to evolve resistance to insecticides. Although in-
secticide resistance is widely considered to be inevitable,
the evolutionary processes underlying the evolution of
insecticide resistance remain poorly understood. One
possible explanation is that insecticide exposure may
alter epigenetic modications, which alter heritable pat-
terns of gene expression without actually changing the
underlying DNA sequence. The Colorado potato beetle
(CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, has been extraordi-
narily successful at adapting to all insecticide classes,
including the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid. We
will test how beetle exposure to sublethal doses of imi-
dacloprid can alter multigenerational and transgenera-
tional epigenetic inheritance of insecticide tolerance.
Position Responsibilities: The postdoctoral associate
will be expected to manage a multigenerational beetle
breeding project, extract DNA/RNA, and analyze whole-
genome bisulte sequencing data from an experimental
evolution study. This will provide training opportunities
in bioinformatics analysis, genomic inheritance, and epi-
genetic analysis. The successful applicant will also help
in the mentoring of undergraduate student projects.
Qualications: Candidates are expected to have a Ph. D.
in Evolutionary Genomics, Molecular Ecology, Genetics,
Entomology, or related eld. Experience in analyzing
large bioinformatic datasets (reduced representation,
transcriptomic, or sequencing). Desirable skills for this
project include familiarity with Linux operating systems
and computer programming (Python, and R). Expe-
rience in DNA/RNA extraction, running PCRs, and128 EvolDir January 1, 2022
optimizing protocols.
How to Apply: Funding for this position is available for
two years with the possibility of an extension. To apply,
please send a single pdf with a cover letter demonstrat-
ing your interest in the position, a CV, 1-2 representative
publications, and contact information for three refer-
ences to Dr. Yolanda Chen, (yolanda.chen@uvm.edu).
Start date is exible but is targeted for May 1, 2021.

ington. We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to
join an eort to explore the role of biological resilience
in aging, using the fruit y as a model.
Our goal is to explore resilience as a way to understand
how and why systems fail as organisms age. As individ-
uals age, they lose resilience, with stressors forcing them
into tipping points that lead to failure. Our goal is to
develop tools to identify high-dimensional metabolomic
and transcriptomic signatures of resilience, to explore
the underlying mechanisms, and to suggest potentialJanuary 1, 2022 EvolDir 129
approaches to prevent the loss of resilience.
We are seeking someone with a PhD in biology, genomics,
computational biology, or a related eld, and ideally
with fruit y experience. The ability to work extremely
will in a team is essential.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
The Postdoctoral Researcher will: - Design and carry out
pilot experiments under the supervision of Dr. Promis-
low - Coordinate the metabolomic and transcriptomic
data generation and analysis. - Analyze metabolomic
and transcriptomic data generated from hundreds of
samples. - Write up and publish results. - Contribute to
regular lab meetings and one-on-one discussions about
project design and progress.
REQUIREMENTS:
PhD in biology, genomics, computational biology, sys-
tems biology, or a related eld.
Other required qualications include: - Skilled in the use
of the R or Python statistical environment - Strong un-
derstanding of the statistical approaches and nuances of
high- dimensional data analysis - Strong organizational
skills. - Ability to learn and integrate new analysis meth-
ods. - Excellent oral and written communication skills.
- Ability and enthusiasm for working independently, and
also collaboratively as part of a team
DESIRED: - Familiarity with metabolomic and/or tran-
scriptomic proling - Practical understanding of the
biology of aging. - Excellent mentoring skills and desire
to work with undergraduates
Interested candidates should send an email with CV,
a brief statement of research experience and interests,
and names of three referees to Daniel Promislow at
promislo@uw.edu no later than Dec 15, 2021.

ComputationalModeling
We are seeking two additional postdoctoral researchers
to join our interdisciplinary data science team of
eight faculty and over 13 postdocs, spanning multi-
ple research areas in ecology and evolutionary biol-
ogy. As part of the modelscape consortium (https:/-
/microcollaborative.atlassian.net/l/c/XKdt1uGq), the
postdoctoral researchers will work closely with one or
more faculty members at the University of Wyoming:
Alex Buerkle, Sarah Collins, Daniel Laughlin, Lauren
Shoemaker, and Topher Weiss-Lehman.
Dramatic increases in the scale and availability of data
are profoundly reshaping all domains in the life sciences.
Data acquisition and availability from DNA sequencers,
environmental sensors, parallel global studies, and im-
agery are outpacing our capacity for analysis, including
the development of models that represent our knowledge
of biological processes. Research in our consortium is
developing and competing computational, statistical,
and machine learning methods for multi-dimensional
data to create predictive and explanatory models for
the life sciences. The project focuses on three research
areas: (1) connecting genome to phenome (particularly
in the context of evolutionary biology), (2) mechanistic
modeling of species interactions and community diver-
sity, and (3) time series of material and energy ux in
aquatic ecosystems.
The positions are 100% research with exible start dates;
however, preference will be given to candidates who will
be able to join the consortium immediately. The posi-
tions are for two years, with the possibility of extending
the appointment, contingent upon performance.
The postdoctoral researchers will be primarily based in
one or a few labs but will benet from the opportunities
to collaborate broadly. The positions allow for multiple
professional development opportunities, including train-
ing in highly interdisciplinary science, collaborations
across institutions, regular meetings with the entire con-
sortium, mentorship toward academic and non-academic
career development, and interactions with graduate and
undergraduate students.
Successful applicants are not expected to have expertise
in all facets of the project, but rather may be experts
in a given domain of the life sciences or area of model-130 EvolDir January 1, 2022
ing. The postdoctoral researchers will primarily analyze
existing and simulated data, and will have additional,
complementary opportunities for laboratory or eld re-
search. We recognize that the best science can originate
from diverse collaborations with people from varied
backgrounds, and we especially encourage applicants
from underrepresented groups to apply. The positions
are supported by a 4-year, $6 million NSF EPSCoR
RII Track-2 grant in response to our proposal entitled
'Highly predictive, explanatory models to harness the
life science data revolution'.
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: Completion by the po-
sition start date of all requirements for a PhD in ecology,
evolutionary biology, environmental science, statistics,
computer science, mathematics, complex systems sci-
ence, or a related eld.^ a e

applicants should state clearly and illustrate how their
experience and interests match the following preferred
qualications. 1. Record of publishing in peer-reviewed
literature 2. Excellent verbal and written communica-
tion skills 3. Experience in at least one of the following

Course Overview:
The world around us is a space-time mosaic where forms
evolve, constantly change, and interact with each other.January 1, 2022 EvolDir 131
Geometric morphometry is a digital morphological anal-
ysis tool that allows addressing biological key questions,
such as shape transformation (variation) and the result
of its interaction (covariation) with the physical envi-
ronment, with an unprecedented analytical resolution.
In this course, these concepts will be explained in a
simple and practical way. To do this, basic aspects such
as the biological and geometric concept of landmark
and semi-landmark congurations will be reviewed, the
available comparative methodologies will be compared,
and basic multivariate statistical methods will be put
into practice that allow addressing biological problems
at any scale of complexity, making special emphasis on
visualization and interpretation of form variation.
This course is introductory.

Online IntroductionToFloraOfAlaska
Jan10-Apr25
Dear all,
Due to COVID restriction BIOL331 Systematic Botany
will be oered as an online option again this year at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks. Are you interested in
learning about the Flora of Alaska as well as getting
familiar with some unique approaches to delivering a
systematic botany course online, this might be the one
for you. One of the hallmarks of systematic botany
courses is the hands-on learning experience in a labora-
tory setting. To create a similar lab experience or the
online oering, we have carefully chosen technology that
will allow students from all over the state (and even out-side Alaska) to collect data in their home communities,
perform plant dissections and have a hands-on learn-
ing experience within the ora's native environment.
Instead of traditional course materials like textbooks,
students will purchase an inexpensive wide-angle macro
lens that connects to their smartphone or tablet. This
2-inch lens lets students take high-resolution, detailed
photos of ora on the go with classifying metadata, such
as GPS location attached. The technology not only lets
students mimic lab spaces in their own natural areas
but also expands their digital networks through the sub-
mission of images to iNaturalist, enabling them to share
and collaborate with enthusiasts around the world and
contribute citizen science data to research. Students
don't just sit at their computers in this class, they go
outside, touch with their hands and share what they
discover.
Where: University of Alaska Fairbanks (USA)
Instructor: Dr. Ste Ickert-Bond (Professor of Botany
and Curator of the Herbarium (ALA) at the University
of Alaska Fairbanks)
Course description
Classication of owering plants with emphasis on
Alaskan ora; familiarity with taxonomy (identica-
tion, nomenclature, classication), evolution (speciation,
reproductive biology, adaptation, convergence, biogeog-
raphy) and phylogenetics (morphology and molecules).
Lab emphasizes learning representative families and
genera of Alaskan ora using keys and manuals.
Student learning outcomes:
A student who successfully completes BIOL F331 should
gain the ability to: 1. Discover and classify plant di-
versity found in Alaska and beyond. 2. Describe and
explain the major features and the evolutionary origin of
vascular plants. 3. Interpret and evaluate the analytical
and experimental tools to understand organismal diver-
sity of plants. 4. Use and apply the vocabulary of plant
description. 5. Contribute to biodiversity documenta-
tion through the iNaturalist citizen science platform.
6. Identify plants using dichotomous keys. 7. Recog-
nize the major selected gymnosperm, and angiosperm
families in Alaska.
Dates: The 3-credit class will run from 10 Jan.- 25 April
and is fully asynchronous.
Registration: You can register at https://-

Dear colleagues,
Registration is open for the course \Understanding
Macroevolutionary Dynamics using RPANDA and
jPANDA", January 31st-February 11th, 2022.
Schedule: Online live sessions on 31st of January, and
2nd, 4th, 7th, 9th, and 11th of February, 2022 (Madrid
time zone).
Instructors: Dr. H >1

2ne Morlon (IBENS, France),
Sophia Lambert (IBENS / MNHN, France), Dr. Fa-
bien Condamine (Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de
Montpellier, France), Dr. Ignacio Quintero (IBENS,
France), Dr. Julien Clavel (CNRS, France), Dr.
Jonathan Drury (Durham University, UK) and Dr.
Benoit Perez-Lamarque (IBENS, France)
Course Overview:
Phylogenetic analyses are central for understanding the
ecological and evolutionary processes shaping present-
day biodiversity patterns.
In this course participants will learn phylogenetic anal-
yses with the RPANDA R package. They will also have
a quick introduction to Julia and to the jPANDA Julia
package.
The RPANDA package contains tools for macroevolu-
tionary analyses on phylogenetic trees, in particular for
the analysis of diversication and trait evolution from
comparative data.
The instructors will introduce the theory behind these
analyses, run practicals with illustrative examples, and
guide the interpretation of the output of these analyses.
This workshop is primarily intended for (but is not
exclusive to) graduate students and postdocs. Partici-
pants are encouraged to bring their own phylogenetic
datasets (with potentially matching trait, biogeographic
and paleoenvironmental datasets).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
