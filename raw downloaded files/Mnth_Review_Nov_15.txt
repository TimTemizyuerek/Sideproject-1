The American Genetic Association President's Sympo-
sium, \Local adaptation: from phenotype to genotype
to tness", will be held July 14-17, 2016, at beautiful
Asilomar, CA (http://www.visitasilomar.com/).
In the past, many studies dealt only with pheno-
types/traits, but today the connection to genotype is
becoming feasible for more and more organisms. Our
speakers are a blend of established and new investiga-
tors, working on a variety of organisms, and who are
taking diverse approaches to the question.
The AGA will provide several travel awards to cover
registration, room and board for graduate students who
would like to attend.
Details and registration will be available in January 2016

EvolutionOfMechanisms Jan28-31
Evolution of Mechanisms, January 28-31, 2016, Univer-
sity of Debrecen, Hungary
We are happy to announce an exciting symposium \TheNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 3
evolution of mechanisms: a workshop on the integra-
tion of life history evolution and physiology" held at
the University of Debrecen, Hungary in January 28-31,
2016.
In the past decades research in behavior and life his-
tory has been dominated by two dierent approaches:
molecular biologists and physiologists investigated the
ne-scaled mechanisms of how life history and behavioral
processes are regulated, while theoretical and organismal
biology provided an explanation for the adaptive value of
such traits and the evolutionary forces that shape them.
While both approaches have been extremely success-
ful, the proximate-ultimate dichotomy is not warranted
anymore: our next challenge is to integrate these ap-
proaches and to understand the evolution of the genetic,
endocrine mechanisms and signaling pathways that ulti-
mately lead to a bewildering diversity of life-forms.
In order to advance the discussion between these tradi-
tionally distinct areas, we organize a workshop where
we invite theoreticians and empiricists working in the
elds of physiology, molecular biology and evolutionary
ecology to discuss the current state of the art and to
articulate a research agenda for the future, where they
identify the key challenges and approaches to study the
evolution of the integrated phenotype and physiological
underpinnings of life history evolution. Instead of the
dominantly unidirectional information ow of conference
symposia, we organize this meeting to promote discus-
sion and debate about ideas, concepts of how we can
understand the evolution of mechanisms that provide
the raw material for natural selection.
Participants are invited to give contributed talks that
advance the goal of the meeting. Additional poster
presentations will also be welcome.
Invited speakers:
Thomas Flatt (University of Lausanne): The mecha-
nisms underpinning life history evolution
David Gems (UCL): Role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in
the evolution of life histories and ageing
Laura Lavine (Washington State University): Endocrine
signaling and the development of the weapons of sexual
selection: insights from beetles
Pat Monaghan (University of Glasgow): Environmental
eects that shape individual life histories: mechanisms,
trade-os and time scales

Genomics and Forest Tree Genetics Conference A con-
ference jointly organised by the four working parties of
IUFRO subdivision 2.4 (Genetics) with two side events:
Genomic Selection workshop & IUFRO Task Force meet-
ing 30 May - 3 June, 2016 - Arcachon, France https:/-
/colloque.inra.fr/iufro2016/ Just a decade after the
rst forest tree genome sequence was published (that of
black cottonwood in 2006), the rapidly evolving toolsand methods of *'omics'* and *bioinformatics* have ad-
vanced our understanding of the following topics: tree
growth and development; the responses of trees to in-
trinsic and extrinsic factors; the remarkable buering
capacity of trees, enabling them to cope with chronic
stresses and extreme events; the molecular basis of ge-
netic variation within and between species and the way
in which this variation has been shaped by evolutionary
forces and its relationship to phenotypic variation and
adaptation.
Genomics will undoubtedly play a major role over the
next decade and beyond, not only to further under-
stand the mechanisms underlying the adaptation and
evolution of these organisms, but also to develop and
implement innovative management and policy actions to
preserve the *adaptability* of natural forests and inten-
sively managed plantations. Knowledge gained through
the use of 'omics' technologies can thus have a huge
potential impact when helping forests adapt to the main
challenges they will face in the future (e.g. increasing
wood demand, pressure to conserve forest areas, climate
changes and associated threats).
Therefore, /*the objective of this conference - bringing
together researchers from the four working parties of
IUFRO subdivision 2.4 (Forest Genetics) - is to present
and discuss new scientic ndings in the area of *//*pop-
ulation, quantitative and evolutionary genetics and how
they can be applied in genetic resource conservation
and breeding*/. Participants may submit contributions
from empirical, experimental and theoretical pieces of
works, that address key leading scientic and applied
issues.

International Conference on Polyploidy, Hybridization
and Biodiversity
11-14 May 2016, Rovinj, Croatia
Dear Colleagues,
It is our great pleasure to inform you that InternationalConference on Polyploidy, Hybridization and Biodiver-
sity (ICPHB 2016) will be held from May 11 to 14,
2016 in Rovinj, Croatia (http://www.hbd-sbc.hr/en/-
icphb2016/). This conference presents cutting edge
research into the importance of polyploidy in genetics,
evolution and ecology. The topics of the conference are
organized in three core sessions: (1) the long-term and
(2) immediate consequences of interspecic hybridiza-
tion and polyploidy. These explore eects over deep
time and shallower time frames and focus on genet-
ics and epigenetics. The nal core session will be: (3)
polyploidy in light of ecological genetics where we will
discuss current data showing eects of hybridization
and polyploidy on phenotypes, niche occupation and
ecology. While previous polyploidy meetings have been
dominated by plant research, there is now much exciting
new data from animals and fungi, areas we are partic-
ularly keen to encourage. On behalf of the organizing
committee, we cordially invite you to join the confer-
ence to communicate with the distinguished speakers
and share your research results.
Call for Presentation and Attendance
You're welcome to attend our conference (without
presentation) or submit your abstract through reg-
istration system for an oral and poster presenta-
tion (http://www.hbd-sbc.hr/en/icphb2016/abstract-
submission/). We would extend our highest appreciation
and warmest welcome to your attention and attendance.
Your participation will be essential to the success of the
conference.
Istrian experience with traditional dinner
Rovinj is one of the most developed tourist destinations
in Croatia, boasting rich natural and cultural heritage
with beautiful landmarks such as the old town and the
lush Zlatnirt (Punta corrente) forest. Zlatnirt is a pro-
tected forest park, while Rovinj's islands and coastal
area are protected landscapes/seascapes. During the
conference participants will have opportunity to travel to
mystic Middle ages of Svetvinaenat in Morosini Grimani
castle - legend about Mare the witch from Svetvinaenat
enriched with the fair of autochtonous products, degus-
tation of Istrian delicacies, learning the istrian typical
music and folk dance - balunia.

Tradeos are pervasive in biological systems, and the evo-
lutionary dynamics underlying cancer are no exception.
IBECC 2015 will explore the ways in which tradeos
have shaped the evolution of cancer suppression systems
and the role of tradeos in the progression of tumors
from benign to malignant. A consideration of evolution-
ary tradeos can also help us to identify challenges and
opportunities in cancer therapy and new horizons for
cancer prevention.
We welcome scientists coming from dierent disciplines,
including but not limited to oncology, cell biology, evolu-
tionary biology and mathematics. Abstract submissions
relating to the theme of evolutionary tradeos and clin-
ical consequences are encouraged but submission on all

Valencia SMBE SatelliteMeeting
May17-20
*SMBE Satellite Meeting. Valencia, Spain. May 17-20,
2016*
We are happy to announce the SMBE Satellite Meeting
on RNA modication and its implication on adaptation
and evolution.
In the last years our knowledge of RNA-regulated pro-
cesses like microRNA-mediated gene expression control,
alternative splicing, and RNA editing has noticeably
expanded. Understanding the scope, mechanisms and
evolutionary patterns of such molecular processes has
emerged as a new challenge in biology, medicine, and
evolution. The objective of this workshop is to bring
together molecular and evolutionary biologists to dis-
cuss the variability of the RNA processing mechanisms,
their adaptive roles, and the promise of next generation
sequencing technologies in order to study their impact
in genome evolution.
We expect early career scientists will benet from this
opportunity to meet top scientists in their respective
elds. To facilitate the presence of PhD and postdoc-
toral students, a limited number of them will be selected
for travel grants. The meeting will hold about 50 people,
so submitted abstracts will be thoroughly selected. The
meeting will be held at the Botanical Garden in Valen-
cia, Spain and will take place from May 17th to May10 EvolDir November 1, 2015
20th, 2016. Valencia, the third largest city of Spain, is a
historical city located on the Mediterranean coast. It is
very well connected to Madrid and Barcelona and also
has its own international airport.

Adelaide Australia AncientDNA
Aboriginal Heritage Project: Phylogeography, Genetics
and Ancient DNA
A PhD project is available at the Australian Centre for
Ancient DNA (https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/) as
part of several ongoing ARC-funded studies to recon-
struct Aboriginal Heritage using ancient DNA and mu-
seum collections of hair samples from across Australia.
The project is a close collaboration with Aboriginal fam-
ilies and communities across Australia and the South
Australian Museum. It is aimed at reconstructing a
continent-wide picture of Indigenous Australia prior to
European colonisation, analysing migration and trade
routes, and the distribution of genetic diversity and
community relationships.
Relevant techniques include ancient DNA, phylogeogra-
phy, archaeology, Aboriginal culture and history, and
museum research. The project has strong potential to
make major contributions to our understanding of Aus-
tralian and Aboriginal history, assist with the Stolen
Generation, and reconciliation more broadly.
The project is a close collaboration with the South Aus-
tralian Museum, BioPlatforms Australia, the Australian
Genome Research Facility, and an international team of
researchers. Fieldwork in remote communities will form
a key part of the project.
A highly motivated candidate with strong initiative and
organisational skills is required, with a background in
areas such as genetics, archaeology, ancient DNA, phy-
logeography, anthropology or museum archival research
and a strong interest in Aboriginal and Australian his-
tory. A publication record would be a distinct advan-
tage, and the position is open to both Australian and
international candidates.
Contact Prof. Alan Cooper,
alan.cooper@adelaide.edu.au, with a letter of in-terest, background information addressing the above
criteria, and a CV by October 21, 2015.

DragonyEvolution
The Bybee Lab at Brigham Young University in the
Department of Biology is seeking a highly motivated
graduate student with an interest in evolutionary biol-
ogy, morphology and insect phylogenetics. Our lab is
currently funded by the National Science Foundation
to produce a large-scale phylogeny of both fossil and
extant Odonata.
Research Interests
The Bybee Lab is focused on the evolution of insects
with a strong emphasis in dragonies and damselies
(Odonata), particularly the evolution of their visual sys-
tems. Our research draws from molecular, morphological
and fossil evidence to examine evolutionary relationships
(phylogeny), morphological innovation, and molecular
evolution. Students interested in exploring such research
topics, particularly morphological evolution, are strongly
encouraged to apply.
Qualications
Applicants should have a background in evolutionary
biology. Experience with invertebrate zoology (extant
and/or fossil), phylogenetics, systematics and/or quanti-
tative skills (bioinformatics, computer programming) is
a plus. The successful applicant will have excellent writ-
ing, communication, and interpersonal skills. Our lab is
highly collaborative so a willingness to work together
is important. Prociency in English (both spoken and
written) will be required. Research in the Bybee lab
will also require physically demanding eldwork as well
as museum work from time to time. Salary and benets
are competitive.

The lab of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen in the Depart-
ment of Natural Resources at Cornell University is look-
ing for a highly motivated PhD student to start in the
fall of 2016.
Research in the lab focuses on how contemporary en-
vironmental change and human impacts shape demo-
graphic, ecological, and microevolutionary processes
within marine species. We are particularly interested in
how human activities cause rapid evolution in many wild
populations and in the roles that ongoing genetic adap-
tation and geographic distribution shifts will play for
species persistence in our rapidly changing world. Our
core tools to address these questions are high-throughput
DNA sequencing methods that are opening completely
new opportunities for population genomic studies of
non-model organisms. A cornerstone of our research is
to analyze time series of genomic data, which allow for
direct tracking of changes over known time scales and
therefore provide a unique opportunity to observe recent
dynamics and microevolution in retrospective real time.
Insights gained through this approach can also be impor-
tant for characterizing population structure in exploited
species, and we are working actively to develop ways to
use genomic analysis for improving marine conservation
and sheries management.
PhD students will have the opportunity to develop their
own project that aligns with the overarching lab interests
or to join ongoing projects relating to sheries-induced
and climate-driven adaptation (based on experimen-
tal data and historical samples collected from wild sh
stocks) and harnessing genomic data for better delin-
eation of biologically relevant units for sheries man-
agement and estimation of contemporary connectivity
between populations.
Applicants should have a strong background and interest
in evolutionary biology, sheries, population genetics,
bioinformatics or a related eld. Familiarity with molec-
ular laboratory techniques, computational skills and
previous experience working with large genomic data
sets will be advantageous. However, the most important
qualications are enthusiasm, drive, excellent written
and oral communication skills, and demonstrated ability
to work independently as well as in collaborative teams.
Interested candidates should send an email describ-
ing their motivation and research interests along withNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 15
a CV, GPA, GRE scores (if available), and names
of three references to Nina Overgaard Therkildsen
(nt246@cornell.edu). Qualied candidates will be con-
tacted to apply for sponsored admission through the
Cornell Graduate Field of Natural Resources by De-
cember 1 2015. Funding for the position is available
through research assistantships, teaching assistantships,
and university fellowships, but candidates will also be
encouraged to apply for external fellowships (in-progess
fellowship applications will be viewed very favorably).
The Natural Resources Graduate Program oers an ex-

EastCarolinaU BehaviorEvolution
The Balakrishnan Lab at East Carolina University is
searching for a Ph.D. student to begin in Fall 2016.
Research in the Balakrishnan lab addresses basic ques-
tions in evolutionary and behavioral biology. Most of
the work in the lab uses genomic approaches (RNA-seq,
population genomics) to better understand the mecha-
nisms of speciation, adaptation and behavior.
The Ph.D. student would be funded for two years un-
der active NSF grants, and for the remaining time un-
der teaching assistantships at ECU. Funded projects in
the lab examine the genomic underpinnings of brood
parasitic behavior, and the continued development of
genomic resources for the study of sexual selection in
neotropical manakins (famous for leks and associated
crazy courtship displays). The recruited student would
have considerable exibility within these broad areas
and study systems to explore independent ideas.
ECU features a very strong group of behavioral and
evolutionary biologists and thus provides a rich envi-
ronment for students interested in these areas. For a
full list of faculty, please see: http://www.ecu.edu/cs-
cas/biology/people.cfm Prospective candidates should
have signicant experience in either the eld, the lab, or
computers, as projects will involve some combination of

EcologyEvolutionModeling
PhD position: Modeling ecology/evolution of a plant
pathogen, ETH Zurich
***The project***
will explore population dynamics of Zymoseptoria trit-
ici, an important fungal pathogen of wheat, using eco-
evolutionary modeling and eld/lab experimentation.
Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agricul-
ture. Current chemical and genetic technologies used to
manage plant diseases are highly vulnerable to pathogen
evolution and are not sustainable. Pathogen evolution
is facilitated by the genetic uniformity underlying mod-
ern agroecosystems. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop new, ecient and sustainable ways to control
plant diseases.
This PhD project intends to make an important con-
tribution towards achieving this goal. The rst phase
aims at comprehensive characterization of both epidemic
and evolutionary factors of the pathogen by combining
eco-evolutionary modeling, eld/lab experiments and
genome sequence analyses. In the second phase the
models will be used to predict the rate of pathogen adap-
tation to disease control and propose optimal spatio-
temporal patterns for applications of fungicides and
resistant host varieties that can disrupt pathogen adap-
tation.
***Working conditions***
Plant Pathology group at the Institute of Integra-
tive Biology, ETH Zurich oers a creative, collabo-
rative research environment and excellent infrastruc-
ture (www.path.ethz.ch). Salary is approximately 48000
Swiss francs per year. Zurich is a vibrant, international
and green city.
The PhD project is funded for three years by the Am-
bizione grant from the Swiss National Foundation with
a possibility of extension for the fourth year.
Unique training in mathematical modeling, bioinformat-
ics and eld/lab experiments increases chances to nd
a job in academia, industry or governmental agencies.
***Requirements***
|Master's/diploma in a quantitative discipline (e.g.
physics, mathematics or computer science), biology oragricultural/environmental sciences.
|Strong interest in mathematical/computational model-
ing in population biology
|Desire to link the models with real-world eld experi-
ments and spend about 40% of time doing experimental

EvolutionaryGenomics
The Assis lab (http://www.personal.psu.edu/rua15/-
index.html) at Penn State is recruiting several highly
motivated Ph.D. students to start in Fall 2016.
Our lab uses computational approaches to study theorigin of genotypic and phenotypic innovation. We are
broadly interested in a number of problems in evolu-
tionary genomics. One current focus of our research
is on gene duplication, which is a major contributor
of new gene functions. Potential projects related to
gene duplication include examining the role of natural
selection in the origin of new functions, elucidating the
genic and functional targets of natural selection, com-
paring functions that arise under dierent evolutionary
scenarios, and applying mathematical models to study
gene expression evolution. There are also opportunities
to study the origin and evolution of small RNAs, en-
hancers, and other noncoding functional elements in the
genome.
The above lists only serve as examples, and candidates
interested in alternative research projects in evolution-
ary genomics are encouraged to apply. Also, note that
our lab is solely computational. While prior knowledge
of a programming language is not necessary, candidates
should have strong quantitative skills and the drive to
learn how to program.

WhiteshSpeciationGenomics
The Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution (FishEc)
located in Kastanienbaum (Lucerne, Switzerland) has
a vacancy for a 1 PhD-student in Genomics of Rapid
Adaptation.
Speciation research has started to address long-standing
questions on the genomic basis underlying and the
genome evolution accompanying the speciation process.
However, the accurate interpretation of genomic pat-
terns is challenged by a variety of dierent processes,
such as drift, selection, gene ow, and recombination,
all acting simultaneously in shaping the genome and
contributing to the heterogeneity of divergence observed
along the genome. A system like the Swiss whitesh
radiation (Coregonus lavaretus complex) permits us to
assess genomic divergence along a continuum of geo-
graphic, genetic, and ecological dierentiation, in or-
der to understand which evolutionary processes drive
adaptation and divergence and to gain insights on the
genomic basis of ecological speciation.
The PhD project advertised here is aiming to build
a reference genome backbone and assess the variation
in genome structure across whitesh species in Swiss
lakes. Another goal will be to investigate the genetic
architecture of ecological and reproductive traits dier-
ing across whitesh species and to compare patterns
of genomic divergence across dierent sympatric and
allopatric species. This will require the development of
innovative analysis methods, which make full use of the
fantastic study system to enhance our knowledge on the
genomic basis of adaptation and speciation.
The successful candidate will have substantial oppor-
tunities to develop his or her own research skills and
to assist in the supervision of Bachelors, and Master
students. The work will consist of the analysis of
next generation whole genome data, the development
of bioinformatics pipelines and tools, and the inter-
pretation and publication of the results. This study
will be carried out in a close collaboration between
the Fish Genomics group (http://www.eawag.ch/en/-
department/shec/main-focus/sh-genomics/) and the
Evolutionary Biodiversity Dynamics group (http:/-

Applications are sought from individuals with a pro-
found interest in Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Ge-
nomics. Applicants should have earned a MSc-degree
(or equivalent) in a relevant eld of evolutionary biology,
or bioinformatics. Excellent communication skills in En-
glish and skills in team work are essential. The duration
of the position will be three years, nanced by the Swiss
National Science Foundation. We are a research depart-
ment of Eawag (Department of Fish Ecology and Evo-

UAmsterdam Evolution
Job description The department of Ecological Science,
section Animal Ecology of VU University Amsterdam
has a PhD-position available for the project
'The impact of anthropogenic noise on species interac-
tions'
Animals use environmental information to make impor-
tant decisions, such as where to forage or whom to mate
with, but this decision-making can be hampered by noise.
Invertebrates provide many crucial ecosystem services,
such as plant pollination or pest control, but little is
known how noise impairs their perception and thereby
their performances. How does anthropogenic noise com-
ing from trac or heavy industry aect communication
or predator-prey interactions among invertebrate com-
munities? And how does noise aect ecological services
such as restraining plant herbivores? We are searching
for a PhD-student who will address these topics and who
will i) quantify sound production and propagation innatural and anthropogenic impacted habitats; ii) quan-
tify the use of signals and cues by dierent species under
various noise regimes; iii) assess the impact of noise on
ecological interactions, such as predators and prey; iv)
predict the impact of noise on ecosystem services and
test these predictions in a eld-based experiment.
Tasks - execute the scientic research as detailed in the
project description; - publish results in scientic journals
as well as in a thesis; - assist in undergraduate courses
given within the Department of Ecological Science; -
adhere to the PhD educational program as prescribed
by the Department.
Requirements - a master's degree, preferably with a
strong interest in ecology, evolution, and/or behavior; -
experience with (invertebrate) eld experiments, behav-
ioral studies, and/or sensory ecology; - excellent ability
to communicate in both written and spoken English;
- good social skills, ability to work independently and
strong scientic motivation;
Further particulars The initial appointment will be for a
period of 1 year. After satisfactory evaluation of the ini-
tial appointment, it can be extended to a total duration
of 4 years. You can nd information about our excellent
fringe benets of employment at www.workingatvu.nl
. Salary Payment will be according to the standard
regulations, from 2,042.- gross per month in the rst
year up to 2,612.- gross per month in the fourth year
based on a full-time appointment.
Application For additional information please contact:

UBasel EvolutionMatingBehaviour
PhD position available on the \Evolution of Mating
Behaviour and Phenotypic Plasticity in Simultaneous
Hermaphrodites"
A 3-year full-time PhD position, funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation (SNSF), is available at
the Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Switzer-
land (http://evolution.unibas.ch). Ideal starting date
January 2016 (with some exibility).
Research in the Sch arer Lab (http://-
evolution.unibas.ch/scharer/) focuses on evolution of
reproduction in hermaphrodites, covering sex allocation,
sexual selection and sexual conict, using free-living
atworms of the genus Macrostomum as models. Their
small size and transparency permits the study of
reproductive structures and processes in vivo, allowing
insights into reproductive allocation, and pre- and
post-copulatory processes. We use a diversity of
approaches, including laboratory experiments, eld
work, developmental biology, transgenesis, genomics,
phylogenomics, and the comparative method. Moreover,
Macrostomum lignano, whose genome was recently
published (Wasik et al. 2015, PNAS), is also used to
study stem cell biology, regeneration and many other
questions.
The available PhD position is embedded in a larger
project aimed at establishing an extensive comparative
dataset in the genus Macrostomum (containing >150
species), which also includes another PhD student, a
part-time technician, and in a second phase a postdoc.
It builds on earlier results that have shown intriguing
convergent evolution in a range of morphological and
behavioural traits (Sch arer et al. 2011, PNAS).
The PhD candidate's main focus involves participa-
tion in international eld collection trips, description
of interspecic variation in mating behaviour, establish-
ment and maintenance of laboratory cultures of multiple
species, and experimental work to study phenotypic plas-
ticity in reproductive traits. Moreover, there is scope
for the candidate to pursue own interests within this
study system.
The successful PhD candidate will be independent, hard-
working, inquisitive, creative, and collaborative. More-
over, he/she should have a keen interest in evolutionary
biology and must be willing to learn new techniques andstatistical approaches. Documented skills in maintain-
ing cultures of aquatic invertebrates is a clear advantage,
as are experience with behavioural assays and labora-
tory experimentation. A MSc or equivalent education
is required for this position the SNSF salary is very
handsome.
The Sch arer Lab belongs to the Zoological Institute, a
stimulating and highly international research environ-
ment with English as the primary language (http://-
evolution.unibas.ch/research.htm). The Institute has
a strong background in experimental design, statistics,
population genetics, quantitative genetics, genomics and
molecular biology. So it is an ideal place for a PhD can-
didate interested in evolutionary biology. Basel is the
third largest city in Switzerland and attractively sit-
uated at the foot of the Jura mountains. It has the
beautiful river Rhine, and directly borders Germany
and France, thus oering rich culinary, cultural, and
outdoor activities.
To apply, please send a letter of motivation, a CV, con-
tact details of 2 referees, and a copy of your MSc-thesis
(if available) to lukas.scharer@unibas.ch (electronic ap-
plications in a single le preferred). Review of appli-
cations starts on October 31, but applications will be
considered until the position is lled.

UBath 2 ComparativeGenomics
Two four-year fully funded PhD positions are available
in the lab of Laurence Hurst at the Milner Centre for
Evolution, University of Bath, funded by an ERC Ad-
vanced grant. For both projects prior experience in
bioinformatics is advantageous but not essential.
Project 1: Is selection stronger on error proong when
populations are small: a comparative genomic analysis
http://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=3D66491 Classically
we assume that selection is less ecient when popula-November 1, 2015 EvolDir 29
tions are small. This is thought to explain why species
with small populations have larger genomes (including
larger intergene space and larger introns) owing to
the accumulation of weakly deleterious insertions.
Experimental evidence from analysis of splice control
suggests that this accumulation should in turn lead
to higher rates of error prone splicing. Do then large
genomes adapt to these high error rates and are other
sorts of errors also aected? This project considers
this problem using splice control signals, intronic
stop codons and 3UTR frameshift stops as possible
exemplars.
Project 2: The evolution of new genes and new gene
expression
http://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=3D66493 Where does
novelty come from? How for example do genes evolve
new expression proles and how do new transcripts
come about? We recently showed that the expression
change of one gene is coupled to that of its neighbours
(piggy-backing) in humans and in yeasts. Moreover,
we revealed that endogenous retroviruses aect the
expression of neighbours but also generate new
chimaeric genes, some of which may be human-specic
new protein coding genes. This project will address
the following issues: Is piggy-backing a common mode
of gene expression evolution and what determines its
genomic span? How, if at all, are down-regulated genes
compensated? Can we employ patterns of insulated
expression change (no piggy backing) to dene genomic
safe zones for gene therapy? How does HERV-H drive
piggy-backing and how does it act as a source of novel
transcription and functional chimeric genes. In the
rst instance we shall concentrate on the de novo gene
ESRG.

(1) Evolutionary rescue in the face of climate change?
Testing for local adaptation at the southern range mar-
gins of European butteries (Supervisors; Dr Jon Bridle,
University of Bristol, Dr Rob Wilson, University of
Exeter)
We are looking for a highly-motivated student to test
the ecological eects of climate change on buttery com-
munities, and the role of evolution in increasing their
resilience. Profound eects on ecosystem function are
predicted as climate change generates rapid shifts in
species' geographical distributions. Many organisms
have already contracted their ranges at equatorial mar-
gins to higher altitudes, and expanded their ranges as
their poleward margins become increasingly habitable.
However, these responses seem limited by rates of evo-
lution. Although most generalist species have shifted
their ranges, most specialist species remain trapped in
increasingly fragmented habitats, apparently because
they cannot adapt to local conditions at their ecolog-
ical margins. Dening critical levels of environmental
change therefore depends on understanding how eas-
ily (and how quickly) evolutionary rescue can occur at
ecological margins.
This project will explore evolution in European but-
teries at their southern (contacting) margins in com-
parison to that observed at their northern (expanding)
margins. Adaptive divergence may be easier at contract-
ing margins because population sizes are initially high,
making genetic variation locally available. By contrast,
at expanding margins evolution may require the spread
of novel mutations from distant populations, or may
cause the rapid loss of adaptive variation. You will:
(i) conduct buttery and host plant surveys in central
Spain, and comparing their thermal niches to our previ-
ous data; (ii) Use population genomics to test for local
adaptation at contracting range margins in comparison
to those involved in poleward expansions; (iii) conduct
eld transplant experiments to test for adaptive diver-
gence in maternal behaviour and larval survival and and
by testing larval growth rate at dierent altitudes.
You will be based at the University of Bristol, with
periods at the University of Exeter, and two eld sea-
sons in Madrid. You will receive expert training in30 EvolDir November 1, 2015

Graduate student - Insect Phylogenetics
Karl Kjer is setting up a lab at the department of Ento-
mology and Nematology at UC-Davis this fall (2015).
He has support for a graduate student working on insect
phylogenetics for next fall (2016). The Kjer lab has been
involved in Sanger sequencing, but has moved to phyloge-
nomics with high throughput sequencing. These \big
data" eorts require familiarity with computers. Kjer
works on Trichoptera phylogenetics, as well as deep
insect phylogenetics, and the barcode of life initiative.
Check his website for further details on Kjers research
program. http://kkjer.faculty.ucdavis.edu/research/
Experience in the lab is not important, as this can be
taught. Familiarity with computer code is a plus, as
this is increasingly important, and takes a long time to
learn. Although grades and scores are not everything,
undergraduate GPA and GRE scores will play a role in
selection. Publications and awards are important. Most
important is a passion for learning: Whether it is insects,
or evolution and phylogenetics, or bioinformatics, I am
looking for passionate interest. Applicants who have
applied for funding will be evaluated highly. Please see
NSFs website https://www.nsfgrfp.org/ (the deadlinefor this is Oct. 26: you should apply regardless of where
you end up, as these things indicate initiative.) Seeking
other sources of support is also important. To clarify,
I have support, but those who apply for alternative
sources would be highly ranked.
The Entomology and Nematology department at UC
Davis is an interactive and highly ranked program, in a
wonderful place to live http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/.
Kjer has an endowed position with funds to support his
research. The Kjer lab is generally small, and students

Biodiversity-Ecosystem functioning in a ciliate's world:
how inter-individual variation shapes ecosystem func-
tions in the face of stress
Research Environment: UCL is a multidisciplinary uni-
versity situated in Louvain-la-Neuve (French-speaking
Southern part of Belgium). Its Earth & Life Institute
regroups around 450 people performing research in vari-
ous themes linked to earth and life sciences, including
its Biodiversity section, a group of 7 teams, each led by
a professor focusing their research on ecology, evolution
and biodiversity. The Quantitative Conservation Biol-
ogy team (www.uclouvain.be/quant-cons-biol), led by
Prof. Nicolas Schtickzelle, focuses on viability and dy-
namics of (meta)populations in a context of biodiversity
conservation. Our research aims to study, quantitatively
and on model systems, the eect of major perturbations
on species viability; the two main research axes are
based on natural buttery metapopulations in the wild,
and experimental microcosms of unicellular organism in
the lab. The project will be co-supervised by Prof. Fred-
erik De Laender, University of Namur (French-speaking
Southern part of Belgium), PI of the lab of environmen-
tal ecosystem ecology (www.eeecology.eu). Frederik is
currently supervising a team of 8 PhD students working
on community and ecosystem ecology and ecotoxicol-
ogy using models and microcosm approaches. A main
research area this lab is active in is the relationship
between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and envi-
ronmental stress exerted by toxic chemicals.November 1, 2015 EvolDir 31
Research summary: Despite the huge body of the re-
search on the relationship between biodiversity and
ecosystem functioning, we still do not have a clear under-
standing of the mechanisms underlying it. In particular,
biodiversity is often equated with species richness, and
the need to understand the eects of functional diversity
on ecosystem functioning is pressing. Moreover, study-
ing the inter-individual variation in functional traits
will facilitate understanding the key processes behind
biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. We
propose a PhD project focused on investigating how
functional diversity measured at the individual level af-
fects multiple ecosystem functions. In the second phase
of the project we will ask how eects of several abiotic
stressors (salt, pesticides) aect functional biodiversity,
and thus ecosystem functioning. These questions will
be addressed using a highly exible microcosm labora-
tory system with a ciliate species, which in our lab is
represented by 44 strains (genetic clones) diering in
major functional traits, in particular mobility and mor-
phology. We aim exploiting such diversity of functional
traits to inspect their eect on several ecosystem func-
tions, e.g. biomass, dissolved oxygen and productivity.
The project also includes a strong modeling component.
First, the eect of intraspecic functional diversity (i.e.
inter-individual variability in trait attributes) on ecosys-
tem functioning will be synthesized with analytically
tractable models. Second, the eect of the selected stres-
sors on these traits will be included. More information

cosms or on the developed modeling techniques can be

UEdinburgh 2 Evolution
Dear prospective PhD students,
Two Phd projects in my lab (http://jarrod.bio.ed.ac.uk/-
jarrod.html) are available, starting in the autumn of
2016.
The rst project seeks to understand how patterns of
selection and inheritance change when an individual's
phenotype is partly determined by the actions of other
individuals, particularly kin. The project is mainly em-
pirical, and will involve experimental manipulations in
a wild population of blue tits close to Edinburgh. How-
ever, there is scope within the project to explore both
theoretical and statistical aspects. More details can be
found at:
http://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
projectdetails.aspx?PJID=67311 The second involves
working with very large data bases collected by citizen
scientists on the spawning phenology of the common
frog, together with genetic data collected by the student
in collaboration with citizen scientists. The aim is to
understand the relative magnitudes of local adaptation
and gene-ow in shaping how frogs respond to spatial
and temporal dierences in the climate. The work will
involve both empirical and theoretical aspects, and
more details can be found at:
http://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
projectdetails.aspx?PJID=67312&LID=3300 Un-
fortunately, the UK funding system is not very fair to
non-UK applicants, but the University of Edinburgh
does have positions for non-UK applicants. They
tend to be competitive, but evolutionary biology
has been successful in most years. For those inter-

SexualConictHaplodiploidy
I would like to advertise two PhD projects at the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh.
Advisory team: Dr. Laura Ross (Edinburgh), Dr. Kon-
rad Lohse (Edinburgh), Dr. Andy Gardner (st Andrews)
and Dr. Lyn Cook (University of Queensland)
Project 1: Intralocus sexual conict and genome evolu-
tion in haplodiploid organisms
Sexual conicts result from a clash of interests between
the sexes [1]. In many cases, this battle is fought at
the level of the gene: males and females may dier
with respect to which version of a gene maximizes their
Darwinian tness. Whilst the eects of such intralocus
sexual conicts have been studied intensively in many
organisms, the vast majority of studies have focused
on species with classical, diploid sexual reproduction.
However, as many as 15% of animal species exhibit an
alternative, haplodiploid mode of inheritance. In such
species, mothers monopolize the production of male
ospring, either by asexual production of sons or by
producing sons that eliminate their father's genome af-
ter the zygote stage [2]. This asymmetrical mode of
inheritance is likely to aect the outcome of intralocus
sexual conict. Specically, as alleles that favour male
tness cannot be passed on directly from fathers to sons,
sexual conicts may be resolved in favour of females [2].
The aim of this project is to study the fate of alleles un-
der intralocus sexual conict in a range of haplodiploid
taxa. Studying such exceptions to the general rules of
reproduction provides illumination of the fundamental
principles of evolutionary genetics (see [3] for a recent
comparable example).
This project will combine laboratory experiments, geneexpression studies and genome analyses. We will focus
particularly on springtails and fungus gnats, as males in
these species carry and express their father's genomes,
but do not pass them on to their ospring. In addition,
these species still retain recognizable sex chromosomes,
which enables informative sex chromosome / autosome
comparisons (e.g. [3] for a similar approach). These
experimental approaches will be combined with com-
parative phylogenetic analyses and the development of
novel evolutionary theory, according to the interests of
the student. The project is cosupervised by Dr. Gard-
ner (University of St. Andrews) a leading mathematical
biologist whose works spans a wide range of topics in
theoretical biology and genetics. The proposed project
strongly rest upon this collaboration as, on the one
hand, formalization of the relevant theoretical hypothe-
ses is currently lacking and, on the other hand, empirical
work is required for estimation of key model parameters.
The candidate will be based primarily in Edinburgh,
as required by the empirical work, but will spend 1-2
days per month in St. Andrews for the duration of the
project, as well as two 1-2 month intensive visits to the
Gardner lab in years 2 and 3.

Project 2: Sexual conict and the loss of paternal genes
in a group of Australian insects
In thousands of insects reproduction involves \Genomic
exclusion", where males discard the chromosomes they
inherited from their father (Paternal Genome Elimina-
tion, PGE). This unusual type of reproduction gives rise
to sons that inherit genes from both their parents, but in
which genes inherited from their father are suppressed
and eliminated. As a result, males do never pass on any
genes from their father (Gardner & Ross, 2014; Ross et
al.) Until now, the lack of suitable insect study systems
has made it dicult to understand PGE: It is absent
in established model systems such as Drosophila and
tends to be evolutionarily conserved, making compara-
tive studies dicult. However we recently identied a
group of Australian scale insects that vary in the way
they reproduce, with some species eliminating their fa-
ther's genes while others do not. This group therefore
provides a rare chance for acquiring new insights into
the way this peculiar type of reproduction evolved asNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 33
well as the way it is accomplished.
The main questions addressed in the project are why
and how males in some species eliminate the genes
they inherit from their fathers, while others do not.
Understanding this will give general insights into why
reproduction is so variable across the tree of life.
The proposed project will study the reproduction of a
group of insects that is found exclusively in Australia
and feeds on eucalyptus trees. The project on one hand
will involve sampling and determining the reproductive
strategy of a large number of species as well as determine

UFlorida HostParasiteCoevolution
I anticipate accepting several graduate students inter-
ested in studying either host-parasite co-evolution or
Caribbean bat evolution at the University of Florida
starting Fall 2016.
1) Are you interested in interdisciplinary research in
host-parasite evolution? Our lab uses host-specic par-November 1, 2015 EvolDir 35
asites to study primate and human evolution. We use
molecular data from parasitic lice to make inferences
about human evolution. We have used lice to estimate
when humans began wearing clothing, when we left
Africa, whether we had close contact with Neanderthals
and much more. This research has garnered a lot of
media coverage over the years and there are many more
interesting questions to ask.
2) Are you interested in studying bats on Caribbean is-
lands? Our lab is studying the aects of climate change
on bat species. This interdisciplinary work uses molecu-
lar data, fossil data, and ecological niche modeling to
better understand the factors that shape evolution on
islands. The research involves eldwork, labwork, and
at times computer simulation, next-gen sequencing and
bioinformatics.
More information on the lab and our research can be
found at www.mnh.u.edu/mammals/ Applicants
should be highly motivated, able to work both indepen-
dently and in collaborative groups, and have previous
biological research experience. My research group is

BIOLOGICAL REFUGIA OF THE SOUTHERN
OCEAN
We are looking for a highly motivated scientic colleague
to join a multidisciplinary and challenging project.
Research topic
The Southern Ocean (SO) provides a natural laboratory
for research on evolution and biodiversity because of
its long history and geographic isolation. Confronted
with fast-paced environmental changes, Antarctic ecosys-
tems/species/organisms are strongly challenged and face
three possible outcomes: adaptation, migration or ex-
tinction. Past glaciation periods have forced marine
organisms of the SO into refugia, being either ice-free
continental shelf areas, the deep sea or peri-Antarctic
regions, followed by recolonization when ice retreated.
You will try to understand how such past events have
driven diversication and adaptation in shes and how
these can be applied as proxies to understand the con-November 1, 2015 EvolDir 37
temporary situation and predict the future.
The Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Ge-
nomics specialises in research on the evolutionary biol-
ogy of shes and their parasites. In a new collaborative
research project the refugia of Antarctic shes will be
studied.
Prole :
- Master in (marine) Biology, Applied Biology or the
equivalent with excellent study results
- Obligation to prepare a doctoral thesis within 4 years
- Interest in sh biology and polar ecosystems
- Ready to participate in long sampling campaigns under
extreme conditions
- Experience or knowledge on genomics
- You will apply for an IWT fellowship (http://-
www.iwt.be/subsidies/sb) in September 2016
We oer excellent coaching in an inspiring research en-
vironment with the most up to date research facilities.
Interested candidates are requested to submit their ap-
plication (motivation letter, address of three referees,
summary of master thesis and Curriculum Vitae) to
the Arenberg Doctoral School https://icts.kuleuven.be/-
apps/jobsite/domein/9028/9003 before 15 November

Context:
The doctoral research is associated with the BELSPO
project vERSO, in collaboration with prof. Filip Volck-
aert (KU Leuven) and dr. Anton Van de Putte (RBINS).
Funding is available for 1 year and following a positive
mid-term evaluation for 4 years. The lab is based is

EvolutionMatePreference
PhD position: The evolution of mate preference (Uni-
versity of Manchester)
Advisory team: Tucker Gilman (Manchester), AndrewChamberlain (Manchester), Chris Klingenberg (Manch-
ester), Anthony Little (University of Sterling)
Anticipated project title: Mate choice in humans and
animals: mathematical models and empirical tests
Most animals do not mate indiscriminately. Rather,
they are choosy about mates: they prefer some kinds
of mates over others. Mate preferences can be intrinsic
(e.g., genetic), or they can be learned. Presumably, the
strategies by which animals acquire mate preferences
are subject to selection and evolution, but we know
little about how mate choice strategies evolve. Under-
standing this is important because mate preferences
have profound eects on speciation and trait evolution,
and are believed to have helped shape Earth's animal
biodiversity.
In this project, the student will use mathematical and
computational models to predict how mate choice strate-
gies evolve in nature. The student will test the model
predictions by comparing them to the strategies ob-
served in a particularly interesting and amenable study
system - humans. The student will ask human sub-
jects to rate the attractiveness of digitally manipulated
faces as potential long-term or short-term partners, and
will analyse the results to understand mate preferences
and how those preferences are acquired. This will pro-
vide new and potentially surprising information on how
humans and other animals choose mates.
During the modelling part of the project, the student
will work with dynamical systems analysis and stochas-
tic computational simulation using Manchester's world-
leading high-throughput computational facilities. Dur-
ing empirical testing, the student will gain experience
with behavioural research, survey study design, and ad-
vanced statistical analysis. These skills are critical to
careers in modern evolutionary biology and are trans-
ferable to a wide range of careers in the natural and
applied sciences. The advisory team believes that PhD
students should take the lead role in designing their own
research, and thus there will be considerable exibility
in the questions the student asks and the approaches
the student uses to answer them.
The successful candidate will be funded through the
BBSRC Doctoral Training Partnership programme.
For further information about this po-
sition, please contact Tucker Gilman
(tucker.gilman@manchester.ac.uk). To apply, visit

UMelbourne EvolutionSexSociality
Two PhD projects - commencing 2016 (typically Febru-
ary)
Luke Holman lab, School of Biosciences, University of
Melbourne.
I am seeking one or two PhD students to join ongoing
projects involving evolution, sex and sociality in insects,
which are funded by the Australian Research Council
and the University of Melbourne. I am particularly keen
to recruit students interested in working with next gen-
eration sequencing data (both projects) or large-scale
insect experiments (project 1).
Project 1: Genetics of sexual conict in beetles
Sexual selection research commonly talks about good
genes, but just who are these genes good for? There is
evidence that alleles that produce a high-tness female
do not necessarily make a high-tness female, and vice
versa. This is termed intralocus sexual conict, and
it has far-reaching evolutionary consequences. Using
experimental evolution experiments coupled with next-
generation sequencing in Tribolium our beetles, we
will work out which traits are under strong intralocus
conict, which ecological and evolutionary factors deter-
mine the strength of the conict, and which genes are
contested territory in the battle of the sexes.
Project 2: DNA methylation in social insects
If the genome is like a printed instruction book for build-
ing an organism, DNA methylation is like pencil notes
in the margins that allow for reversible modications to
the design. Social insects (bees, ants, wasps, termites)
have two castes queens and workers and recent evidence
suggests that caste (and other, more subtle dierences,
e.g. between dierent types of workers) is under the
control of DNA methylation. Using experiments with
ant and bee colonies as well as whole genome bisulphite
sequencing, we will build on exciting new results from
my lab, and study the interplay between pheromones
and DNA methylation.
Requirements
Successful applicants will be assisted in applying for an
Australian Postgraduate Award (for Australians) or an
International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (for
Internationals) through the University of Melbourne.
To be competitive, a First-class Honours or MastersDegree (or international equivalent) or publication in
international journals are essential. The APA and IPRS
applications are short, but the deadline is soon: 31st
October 2015. Thus, please send applications by 19th
October or earlier.
To apply, please send A) A brief letter outlining your re-
search interests; B) an academic CV; C) your academic
transcript/grades; D) contact details of two referees
(including a previous research supervisor).

PhD Graduate Research Assistantship in Neotoma evo-
lutionary genetics and ecological adaptation.
A Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistantship is available to
study ecological adaptation and hybridization between
two species of woodrats (genus Neotoma) in California.
The goal of the project is to identify how diet-based
ecological adaptations may inuence aspects of pre- and
post-zygotic isolation. The student will play a large role
in the design and implementation of eld and laboratory-
based studies that include analysis of gene expression
and microbiome changes in pure and hybrid genotypic
classes as they are exposed to chemically-distinct, eld-
based diets. The student will also participate in a high
school outreach program focused on teaching genetics,
ecology and evolution. Candidates should be creative
and highly motivated with strong writing and com-
munication skills. Candidates must have a B.S. (andpreferably an M.S.) in biology or a closely related disci-
pline. Candidates must have eld experience (preferably
with small mammals), ability to work under rigorous
eld conditions and lead eld crews under their supervi-
sion, some genetics laboratory experience and interest
in science education.
Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistantships (2). Pygmy
rabbit ecology, demography, and landscape connectivity.
Two Ph.D. research assistantships are available at the
University of Nevada-Reno on a project focused on
building a quantitative understanding of the ecology,
demography and population connectivity of the pygmy
rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) in Nevada. The pygmy
rabbit is a sagebrush specialist that is broadly (but
non-continuously) distributed across the Great Basin.
Like other habitat specialists, the pygmy rabbit is ex-
pected to be particularly vulnerable to climate change.
Further, because of the predicted loss and degradation
of sagebrush ecosystems over the coming decades, it is
critically important to identify key areas that may serve
as refugia or movement corridors for pygmy rabbit and
other sagebrush obligates while large, relatively intact
sagebrush tracts remain available for study. The goal
of this project is to quantify population dynamics and
dispersal/colonization capabilities of the pygmy rabbit
in Nevada to develop a more complete view of the habi-
tat and landscape characteristics that sustain local and
regionally connected populations. Although both stu-
dents will be expected to collaborate extensively, we
expect that one Ph.D. student will focus primarily on
landscape genetics (advised by Dr. Marjorie Matocq),
while the other student will focus on demography and
population modeling (advised by Dr. Kevin Shoemaker).
Field research for both students will include trapping
and marking pygmy rabbits and collecting tissue sam-
ples at numerous sites in Nevada. Laboratory work
for the landscape genetics student will include generat-
ing genetic/genomic datasets to quantify reproductive
success and relatedness within populations and genetic
connectivity among populations. \Laboratory" work for

UPennsylvania MacroevolutionPaleo
PHD FELLOWSHIP IN PALEOBIOL-
OGY/MACROEVOLUTION A PhD fellowship
in Paleobiology is available in the Department of
Earth and Environmental Science at the University of
Pennsylvania, starting in Fall 2016. Prof. Lauren Sallan
seeks a graduate student to address major questions
about the evolution of life. These include: how global
change has aected life over time, how life evolves at
high levels (macroevolution), the relationships of living
and dead animals (phylogeny), and the origins of living
biodiversity. While research in the lab has focused on
shes, any suitable group of fossils may be used.
Potential thesis topics include, but are not limited to:
the long-term eects of mass extinctions (e.g. the end-
Devonian and end-Ordovician), the roles of predation
and competition in marine ecosystem evolution, traits of
adaptive radiations and ~A^ a:Alivingfossils; ~A^a: ?`12
the eects of long-term climate and environmental
changes (e.g. the Late Paleozoic Ice Age) on biodiver-
sity, and major transitions in early vertebrate evolution(e.g. origin of jaws, invasion of land). The student can
also develop a novel project that addresses similar ques-
tions using quantitative, phylogenetic and/or descriptive
methods.
Applicants are encouraged to contact Prof. Sallan (lsal-
lan@sas.upenn.edu) for more details. Additional infor-
mation on the fellowship is available on the departmen-

KangarooReproStrategy
Ph.D. : Reproductive strategies of female eastern grey
kangaroos under uctuating resources
I am looking for a student to explore links between
individual growth, mass changes, foraging behavior and
multi-year reproductive success of female eastern grey
kangaroos, and how these links are aected by environ-
mental conditions, ospring sex, previous reproduction
and female size and age. Kangaroos have indeterminate
growth, therefore face a trade-o between growth and
reproduction throughout life. Foraging strategies vary
among individuals and with reproductive eort, causing
variation in mass gain and subsequent reproductive suc-
cess. Population density, vegetation productivity and
weather vary substantially from year to year, leading
to considerable and unpredictable changes in resource
availability. This research will involve 3-4 months of
eldwork in Victoria, Australia for 2-3 years, to be added
to the existing 8 years of monitoring. The database will
include over 1000 kangaroos, yearly recaptures for 90%
of marked females and about 1200 female-years of data
on reproductive success for 250 females. Candidates
should have a strong interest in evolutionary ecology,
knowledge of the behavioral ecology literature, statisti-
cal skills and an ability to work long hours in the eld,
with limited personal space. A strong attitude for team-
work is essential. The program can start in September
2016 or January 2017. An internal scholarship of C$
19,000 per year for 4 years is available. Although the
research is fully funded, external scholarship holders will
be preferred.
If you are interested, please e-mail me a CV, a letter
explaining why you want to do this research and the
e-mails of 2 people able to assess your potential as a
researcher.

EvolutionInvasiveSpecies
PhD position (environmental DNA and marine biologi-
cal invasions) at the University of Southampton, United
Kingdom
Research aimed at successfully detecting and manag-
ing invasive species has the potential to considerably
mitigate their eects, as well as reveal ecological and
evolutionary mechanisms occurring during the invasion
process. Recent development of advanced molecular
biology techniques has generated revolutionary oppor-
tunities for research. A rapidly emerging example is the
study of environmental DNA (eDNA), in conjunction
with high throughput analyses, which permits character-
isation of species composition and biodiversity monitor-
ing of entire communities. The study of eDNA allows
the detection of inconspicuous or rare species, which
may later expand their ranges and become problematic.
This project will produce standardised eDNA protocols
to rapidly and reliably detect marine non-indigenous
species. In addition, this project will provide genetic
and analytical protocols to compare populations across
dierent spatial scales. The eld samples will be stored
and identied at the National Oceanography Centre
Southampton, which is the largest centre focusing on
marine science in the United Kingdom. Genetic labora-
tory work will be conducted at the Molecular Ecology
and Fisheries Genetics Laboratory (Bangor University,
United Kingdom) that has a state-of-the-art eDNA fa-
cility with clean rooms and all the required laboratory
equipment.
The candidate will join a dynamic research group (Ecol-
ogy and Evolution Lab, University of Southampton) and
work closely with internationally renowned scientists at
Bangor University, who are leaders in the eld of eDNA,
genomics and conservation genetics.

ArthropodEvolution
PH.D. POSITION IN ARTHROPOD EVO-DEVO
The newly established Sharma Lab at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison is seeking a doctoral student for
Fall semester of 2016, who is interested in the evolution
of developmental mechanisms and the biology of arthro-
pods. The position will be based in UW-Madison's
Department of Zoology.
Arthropods have featured prominently in the evo-
devo literature, owing to their short generation times,
tractability in laboratory environments, and modular
segmental architecture. The rapid dissemination of ge-
nomic technologies and resources has also contracted
the gap between model organisms and emerging sys-
tems for study of evolution. Targets of ongoing/planned
projects include the evolution of arthropod appendage
patterning and the evolution of respiratory organs in
arachnids.
Candidates should be self-motivated, intellectually curi-
ous, focused, determined, and able to function as part
of a team. Independent research questions are highly
encouraged. Training of graduate students will vary
depending on the scope of their project, but will in-
variably incorporate (a) workshops in analysis of next-
generation sequence data classes, and (b) workshops
in programming. Techniques implemented in the lab
will include sequencing and analysis of developmental
transcriptomes; gene expression; microinjection; RNAin-
terference; CRISPR/Cas9; and imaging on various sys-
tems.
Successful candidates should anticipate training with at
least three non-model organisms. General imaging and
microinjection equipment will be available in the Sharma
Lab, with additional imaging facilities in the building
(http://www.botany.wisc.edu/nic/) or nearby on cam-

PH.D. POSITION IN ARTHROPOD SYSTEMATICS
AND PHYLOGENY
The newly established Sharma Lab at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison is seeking a doctoral student for Fall
semester of 2016, who is interested in the systematics,
phylogeny, and/or biogeography of arthropods. The
position will be based in UW-Madison's Department of
Zoology.
In terms of described species, arthropods constitute the
most diverse group of animals, and thus an ideal group
to study the evolution of biodiversity. Through the
lens of molecular phylogenies, research projects in the
Sharma Lab aim to decipher how various groups are
related, how geological history has aected the diver-
sication of endemic lineages, and how the evolution
of morphology aects diversication rate. Major ongo-
ing/planned projects include the evolution of Southeast
Asian arachnids, and the systematics and phylogeny
of Pycnogonida (sea spiders), using a target capture
sequencing approach.
Candidates should be self-motivated, intellectually curi-
ous, focused, determined, and able to function as part
of a team. Independent research questions are highly
encouraged. Training of graduate students will vary de-
pending on the scope of their project, but will invariably
incorporate (a) workshops in analysis of next-generation
sequence data classes, and (b) workshops in program-
ming. Techniques implemented in the lab include se-
quencing and analysis of transcriptomes and genomes;
orthology inference; phylogenetic reconstruction; and
comparative methods.
Successful candidates should anticipate training in eld-
work targeting their taxon of interest. General imaging
equipment will be available in the Sharma Lab, with
additional imaging facilities in the building (http://-
www.botany.wisc.edu/nic/) or nearby on campus. Ac-
cess to Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq 2000/2500 platforms48 EvolDir November 1, 2015
will be made available through the UW Biotechnology
Center (https://www.biotech.wisc.edu). Initial training
and mentoring will be intensive and hands-on, and taper

UZurich 2 EvoDevo
This is a re-advertisement of a previous post for various
reasons.
Two PhD positions.
University of Zurich, Institute of systematic Botany and
Institute of Plant Biology.
RESEARCH PROJECT:
The most prominent biphasic organisms are multicellular
land plants, where a haploid gametophyte phase alters
with a diploid sporophyte phase. It is widely agreed
that embryophyte land plants have originated from a
haplontic ancestor with the evolution and subsequent
elaboration of the sporophyte and a parallel reduction
of the gametophyte phase. The bryophytes, the most
basal group of extant land plants, have subordinate,
unbranched, monosporangiate and upright sporophytes
that remain attached to and nurtured by the gameto-
phyte generation. By contrast, vascular land plants have
established complex branched sporophytes consisting of
a diversity of vegetative and reproductive organs. In
spite of its evolutionary signicance, information on the
detailed developmental and genetic mechanisms under-
lining the elaboration of the sporophyte phase remains
fragmentary. Advancement in the eld is primarily hin-
dered by the lack of appropriate model systems in basal
groups of land plants.
Our project proposes to ll this gap by providing a
detailed account on the regulatory mechanism govern-
ing sporophyte development in the most basal group
of extant land plants, the bryophytes. Importantly, we
have recently established two new model species, onefor mosses and one for hornworts, making this research
feasible. More specically, we propose (1) to investigate
the regulatory networks governing the development of
the sporophyte in two major groups of bryophytes, the
mosses and hornworts, using laser capture micro dissec-
tion assisted RNA sequencing; (2) to reconstruct the
putative regulatory networks of bryophyte sporophyte
development and to assess their homology with develop-
mental mechanisms of angiosperms; and (3) nally, to
begin to experimentally verify the regulatory function
of candidate genes using reverse genetics.
This project is founded by a Swiss National Science
Foundation (SNSF) grant.
The Institute of Systematic Botany hosts research
groups working on the evolutionary and ecological
drivers of biodiversity, on the macroevolution of plants,
on plant-insect interactions/pollination, on the evolution
of mating systems, hybridization and speciation. The
Institute of Plant Biology hosts many groups working
on plant molecular and developmental biology, epigenet-
ics, community genomics and plant adaptation. Both
institutes are housed in the beautiful Botanical Gardens
and host a diverse community of researchers in plant
biology.
Ideal candidates will have an MSc in biology with a spe-
cialization in evolution, developmental genetics and/or
bioinformatics. They should be experienced in labora-
tory techniques (DNA/RNA extraction, PCR and RT-
PCR, DNA sequencing, molecular cloning, plant trans-
formation, In Situ Hybridization) with advanced skills
in handling, analyzing and interpreting high-throughput
next-generation sequencing and RNA-seq data. The
position is initially for three years. Selected candidates
will be enrolled in one of the two aliated PHD schools
in evolution or plant sciences.
CLOSING DATE: The positions are opened until lled,
but all application material including CV, a summary
of research experience, a letter of motivation, copies
of relevant publications (published or submitted) and
names and contact information of three reference per-
sons should be received by the 15 of December 2015
to ensure full consideration. The position will start at
the earliest possible date but it is negotiable (January-
February 2016). Candidates should indicate in a cover
letter when they could take up the position.

UZurich MouseSelshGenes
PhD - Evolutionary genetics of a selsh gene in house
mice
Selsh genes are genetic elements that \drive", this is,
they are transmitted to more than 50% of ospring in
diploids, and therefore are able to rapidly spread within
populations. This generates conict within the genome,
as alternative alleles, which may give higher tness to
the genome, are transmitted less often to ospring. The
eects of such conicts are widespread. With the ad-
vent of new technology for creating synthetic driving
elements able to genetically transform wild populations
of animals, it is becoming increasingly important to
understand how ecology and evolution aect the success
of selsh genes.
Our intensive longterm eld study of a large population
of wild house mice provides a rich source of material
for investigating the eects of a selsh gene, the t hap-
lotype. Our eld and laboratory studies, ranging from
animal behaviour to genomic analyses, have revealed
that the t haplotype inuences male reproductive suc-
cess in the wild, male success in sperm competition in
the lab, female activity levels, female lifespan, and MHC
diversity.
In the rst part of this project you will analyse to what
extent tness of wild mice is inuenced by quantitative
trait loci associated with the t haplotype versus other
regions of the genome, using tness estimates from our
longterm study, an extensive genetic pedigree, and a
large SNP dataset from genotyping arrays. In the second
part you will perform an experiment to test the eect of
population density on spread of the t haplotype using
replicate captive populations. While much of the animal
husbandry is supported by animal care technicians, you
will also contribute to animal care.
The ideal applicant is interested in evolutionary and
behavioural ecology, is highly motivated and indepen-
dent, has skills in statistical analysis of large datasets,
and experience in handling animals. A background in
quantitative genetic analysis, including QTL mapping,
is an asset. A MSc degree in a relevant eld is required.
The student will participate in the PhD program in
Evolutionary Biology at the Institute for Evolutionary
Biology and Environmental Studies at the University
of Zurich. Salary is available for 3 years and starts atCHF 47,040 per year. The working language in the
laboratory is English. German skills, although helpful,
are not essential.
Screening of applicants will start on October 19, 2015
and continue until the position is lled. Ideally, the
candidate would start in January 2016. Please send
the following application material in a single PDF le

Vienna SymbioticSpeciation
PhD Position in Symbiotic Speciation, Genetics & Mi-
crobiology at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria
A PhD position funded by the Austrian Science Fund
(FWF) is available to study the impact of the endosym-
biotic bacteria Wolbachia on physiology, sexual behavior
and de novo speciation of the model system Drosophila.
This intracellular bacterium is well known as the prime
reproductive parasite of insects by causing cytoplasmic
incompatibilities, feminization, parthenogenesis or male
killing, but depending on their evolutionary stage, it
also can provide adaptive tness benets to insect hosts,
such as nutritional provisioning or pathogen protection.
We recently found that in some Drosophila species Wol-
bachia specically colonize dened host brain regions
that orchestrate sexual behavior of male and female ies.
Furthermore we found that even slight perturbations
of this intimate host-symbiont homeostasis can foster
de novo speciation of Drosophila in the wild plus under
experimental conditions in our laboratory.
In this newly started FWF research project we aim
to decipher the temporal and functional dynamics of
this Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis in two dierent
Drosophila systems, which are currently under specia-
tion in the Neotropics.
The successful candidate will be embedded in the highly52 EvolDir November 1, 2015
multidisciplinary and collaborative environments at the
Department of Cell and Developmental Biology of the
Medical University of Vienna.
Applicants should hold a master's degree in biology,
genetics, microbiology, or a related discipline. We are
looking for enthusiastic scientists with procient com-
munication skills, who are good team players. Previous
experiences with DNA & RNA techniques, sequence
analyses, y work, FISH assays, immunocytochemistry

WageningenU SexualSelection
PhD position: Molecular Ecology / Sexual Selection
Job description
We oer a PhD position (1.0 FTE) to undertake re-
search on female mate choice and sexual selection in
livebearing sh within the Experimental Zoology group
at the Animal Science Department of Wageningen Uni-
versity, the Netherlands. This position is nanced by
the Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research
(NWO).
The aim of this project is to study dierences in sexual
selection among natural populations of the livebearing
sh Poeciliopsis retropinna in Costa Rica. The project
will quantify the relationships between local environ-
mental conditions, reproductive strategy (placentation,superfetation) and multiple paternity (polyandry). This
will then be linked to female mate choice by looking
at pre-copulatory selection (based on male phenotype
and behaviour), post-copulatory selection (sperm com-
petition) and post-fertilization selection (genetic com-
patibility, asymmetric provisioning). This project will
use an integrated approach to study sexual selection by
combining mate choice experiments, genetic analyses,
comparative analyses of male genitalia and an evalua-
tion of sperm locomotion. The PhD student will use
established lab populations housed at the Aquatic Re-
search Facilities of Wageningen University. The project
is supervised by Dr. Bart Pollux and Prof. Johan van
Leeuwen at Wageningen University.
Requirements
For this interdisciplinary project we look for an enthusi-
astic, result-driven person with a MSc degree in biology,
with a specialization in Molecular Ecology and a strong
interest in evolutionary questions. The candidate should
have excellent research and communication skills, be
creative and independent (yet at the same time a team
player) and be procient in English (both oral and writ-
ten).
Conditions of employment & Organisation
As a PhD candidate, you will be oered a fulltime posi-
tion (38 hours) for 4 years, after which you should have
completed your PhD thesis and individual training plan.
The salary for a PhD candidate starts at 2.125,- gross
per month in the rst year and extends to a maximum
of 2.717,- gross per month in the fourth year (in accor-
dance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch
Universities).

The Porter lab at Washington State University, Vancou-
ver, is recruiting graduate students for fall 2016. Our
lab explores the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of
plants and their microbial symbionts to test fundamen-
tal theory about cooperative interactions. We focus on
environmentally acquired symbioses between plants and
microbial mutualists such as nitrogen-xing rhizobium
bacteria. Our research projects range from the eld, to
the lab to the greenhouse and integrate approaches from
quantitative genetics, ecological genetics and genomics.
Graduate students will have the opportunity to partic-
ipate in the PI's collaborative multi-year NSF-funded
project with the Friesen lab at Michigan State Univer-
sity to investigate evolutionary and ecological shifts in
plant-symbiont mutualism during plant invasions from
Europe into North America. Students are also wel-
come to develop a research program aligned with their
own interests and expertise on related topics in plant
or microbial evolutionary ecology. The lab currently
supports diverse projects ranging from examining how
plant-soil-microbial feedbacks impact succession post-
eruption on Mount Saint Helens, to testing the impor-
tance of microbes to plant adaptation to heavy metals,
to quantifying natural selection on cheating strategies in
mutualism. Visit our research page to read more about
the lab: http://research.vancouver.wsu.edu/porter-lab .
Graduate students will be supported through a combina-
tion of TAship and research assistantship in the Porter
lab (5-6 years for PhD, 2 for MS) with the opportunity
for summer funding. The PI will work with students to
develop competitive applications for independent gradu-

The Biology Department at the College of William and
Mary is recruiting new research Masters students in
ecology and evolution to start in Fall 2016. Full assis-
tantships are provided to nearly all students.
We oer a two-year research-intensive Masters program
where students are supported by teaching assistantships
and full tuition waivers. For many students, getting
a Masters in two years and writing publications and
grants is the ideal preparation for applying to highly
competitive Ph.D. programs or jobs. We have a great
track record of our recent MS students going on to ex-
cellent PhD programs and professional positions. With
a low student-to-faculty ratio (approximately 10 new
students each year with 23 full-time faculty) we can
oer an intimate and highly personalized research and
education experience.
Importantly, we have real strengths in many aspects of
ecology and evolution. We are one of the few smaller uni-
versities that have many evolutionary biologists and ecol-
ogists on their faculty, including: John Swaddle (sexual
selection/behavioral ecology), Jon Allen (evolution and
development), Joshua Puzey (evolutionary genomics),
Helen Murphy (evolutionary genetics/experimental evo-
lution), Drew LaMar (mathematical modeling), Paul
Heideman (physiological evolution), Dan Cristol (behav-
ioral ecology/ecotoxicology), Harmony Dalgleish (forest
ecology), Laurie Sanderson (functional ecology), Randy
Chambers (wetlands ecology), Kurt Williamson (viral
ecology), and Matthias Leu (conservation/landscape
ecology). The proximity of William and Mary to county,
state, and federal parks as well as the Chesapeake Bay
allows for extensive eld research opportunities.
Deadline for applications is February 1, but you should
contact potential advisors soon. You can get general

Cornell Lecturer Evolution
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
(EEB) at Cornell University, invites applicants for a
full-time Lecturer position. The successful applicant
will play a key role in supporting the transition of the
course Evolutionary Biology and Biodiversity (BIOEE
1780) from a traditional lecture course format to an
active learning format focused on student participation
and group problem solving.
Cornell University has a renowned tradition of excel-
lence in the life sciences, including the instructional
engagement of an exceptionally talented and intellectu-
ally motivated undergraduate student body. The person
who lls this Lecturer position will support Cornell's
agship Introduction to Evolutionary Biology and Di-
versity course (BIOEE 1780), which attracts more than
500 students per year as a required course for all Bi-
ology and Environmental Studies majors. This course
covers central concepts in evolutionary biology (includ-
ing phylogenetics, natural selection, sexual selection,
macroevolution, population genetics, and paleontology)
as well as the overall diversity of life on Earth (pre-
sented in a 'tree of life' evolutionary framework). As a
component of Cornell's Active Learning Initiative, this
course is being restructured to stress student engage-
ment by adopting a variety of innovative active learning
instructional methods. The Lecturer will work with a
rotating and highly collaborative group of faculty who
alternate in leading the course and contributing subject
modules. There will be some exibility over the summer
months for the Lecturer to dene their research interests.
Approximately 75% of the eort in this position will be
focused directly on implementing and assessing active
learning methods.
This position is a full-time 9-month appointment, paid
over 12 months. Currently, there is funding for 3 years.
At least a half-time FTE could be renewed indenitely
beyond 3 years, contingent on funding and performance,
and we are committed to seeking additional sources to60 EvolDir November 1, 2015
make this a full-time position. The starting salary will
be commensurate with training and experience. The
anticipated start date for the appointment is July 1,
2016, although an earlier start date would be possible.
We are now reviewing applications and will continue
until a suitable candidate is found. To apply applicants
should submit a single pdf le including their CV, a state-
ment of teaching philosophy and experience, a statement
of research experience, and the names, phone numbers,
and email addresses of three individuals who can serve
as references to https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/-
jobs/6333 .
Qualications:
The candidate should have a PhD in Evolutionary Bi-
ology, Biology Education, or a related eld, and have
excellent organizational, interpersonal communication,
team building, and collaboration skills. A track record
in undergraduate teaching is required, and previous ex-
perience developing active learning curricula, assessing
learning outcomes, and coaching educators is highly
desirable.

Cluster Hire in Emerging Plant Disease and Global Food
Security NC State University
As part of the Chancellor's Faculty Excellence Program,
NC State University seeks four outstanding faculty at
any rank to form a new interdisciplinary faculty cluster
on merging Plant Disease and Global Food Security.
Understanding the dynamics of and managing emerging
plant diseases requires a collaborative approach with
expertise in epidemiology, population biology, micro-
bial evolution, geospatial modeling and bioinformatics.
The new cluster faculty will develop basic knowledge
in these areas and work collaboratively with several
existing clusters to advance NC State University as a70 EvolDir November 1, 2015
leader in addressing the challenges of emerging plant
diseases and global food security.
The faculty cluster will develop new knowledge to under-
stand the fundamental basis of emerging diseases caused
by pathogens of plants \including the development of
tools" enabling a more rapid response to contain and
limit potential damage by emerging threats. The cluster
will study plant pathogens and their arthropod vectors
that transmit them in nature, in agriculture, and post-
harvest making linkages from genomes to ecosystem
processes. The cluster seeks faculty members in four
colleges with expertise in the following areas:
Integration of ecology, epidemiology, population ge-
nomics or host-microbe interactions from the molecular
to population levels to investigate the biology of emerg-
ing plant disease agents, including potential vectors,
that threaten local and global food security,
Engineering next generation devices for real-time de-
tection of plant pathogens or pests that vector them
(e.g., isothermal nucleic acid amplication assays; lig-
and binding-based methods; novel biosensors, nanode-
vices; volatile detection apparatus, or three-dimensional
goggles) and deploy sensors using robotic devices or
unmanned aerial vehicles.
Data scientist focused on conducting cross-cutting re-
search in population genomics, epidemiology and the
evolution of emerging crop pests and pathogens using
molecular, bioinformatics, and evolutionary tools to
track sources of disease outbreaks at multiple levels of
scale
Geospatial analytics for spatially-explicit prediction of
transmission pathways and deploying rapid response
strategies to detect and limit potential damage by emerg-
ing threats including approaches that leverage frontiers
in citizen science, crowdsourcing with mobile technolo-
gies, and engaging stakeholders
Minimum requirements include a PhD in a relevant eld
(such as plant pathology, entomology, biology, evolution-
ary biology, bioinformatics, statistics, math, geography,
chemical and biomolecular engineering, computer sci-
ence) from an accredited institution. The candidates
should have a strong capacity to teach at both the un-
dergraduate and graduate levels and become part of
the integrated core team that develops a Global Food
Security Graduate Certicate Program. The capacity
to mentor doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows is
expected. Priority will be given to candidates that have
demonstrated interdisciplinary collaborations that cut
across academic units. Inclusiveness and diversity are
academic imperatives and thus university goals. The
University is particularly interested in candidates withexperience in working with students from diverse back-
grounds and who have a demonstrated commitment to
improving access to higher education for students from
underrepresented g roups.

I would like to introduce a new citizen science project
called Mark My Bird. Our lab at the University of
Sheeld are 3D scanning bird bills from all the world's
bird species ( ~5000 species scanned so far) and we ask-
ing citizen scientists to help us out by landmarking the
scans at markmybird.org.
The data will be used to test hypotheses on the tempo
and mode of bill evolution. All data (raw scans, land-November 1, 2015 EvolDir 111
marks, PC axes from geometric morphometric analyses)
will be deposited on the open access NHM London Data
Portal (http://data.nhm.ac.uk) alongside publication
so will create digital legacy of the museum collections
from which the data are generate.
Anyone can get involved - even if you are not inter-
ested, maybe your students/colleagues/friends/families
are. We hope that you can help spread the word.

CALL FOR RESEARCH MENTORS
NAPIRE: Native American and Pacic Islander Re-
search Experience at Las Cruces Biological Station,
Costa Rica
Mentors needed between June 20th and August 3rd,
2016
The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) is seeking
Research Mentors (ABD or PhD only) for the Native
American and Pacic Islanders Research Experience
(NAPIRE) Program funded by the National Science
Foundation's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Par-
ticipation (NSF LSAMP) at the Las Cruces Biological
Station in Costa Rica. This is an exciting and highly
rewarding research internship program for minority un-
dergraduate students enrolled in accredited institutions
in the United States and Pacic Island Territories.
The goal of the NAPIRE Program is to facilitate a suc-
cessful summer research experience for Native American
and Pacic Islander undergraduate students and, there-
fore, strengthen their interest and potential for pursuing
careers in biology or environmental science. The pro-
gram seeks to provide a quality, safe environment where
students are motivated to learn scientic skills, such as:
- Critical thinking,
- Hypothesis building and testing,
- Research design and sampling,
- Statistical analysis skills, and- Scientic writing and presentation.
Mentors will live at the Las Cruces Station where they
will provide personal, direct guidance in ecological re-
search for one or two (typically) undergraduate students.
Mentors will guide students as they work to develop
an answerable research question, design their research
goals and data collection methods, analyze data, and
interpret and present results. In addition, mentors will
also participate in symposia, evaluations, and ethics
discussions.
Mentors do not receive honoraria, but NSF funds their
transportation to and from Costa Rica, as well as room,
board, station use, research permits, in-country trans-
portation, and needed equipment and supplies. The Las
Cruces Station oers excellent installations, logistics,
and other conditions for long-term research projects in
forest ecology, climate change, ecological restoration,
habitat fragmentation, and other similar studies.
NAPIRE Mentors are needed between June 20th and
August 3rd, 2016. Interested researchers should send a
letter of interest and a short summary (max 250 words)
of potential student research project(s). This summary
will be used on the OTS website so that students can
select their preferred mentors/projects in their applica-
tions. For researchers who have not previously served as
mentors in the NAPIRE Program, please also provide a
copy of your curriculum vitae and a statement of mentor-
ing philosophy. To allow sucient time for appropriate
matches between mentors and accepted students, please
send this information by no later than November 30th,
2015.
Applications should be sent electronically to

DNAextraction MagneticParticles
Dear colleagues,
We are currently looking for DNA extraction robots
and while the choice (and price range) is quite large,
we have narrowed it down to a few devices, includ-
ing the KingFisher nucleic acid purication products
from Thermo Fischer (i.e. KingFisher Duo Prime Pu-
rication System; KingFisher Flex Magnetic Particle
Processors). These robots are not based on 'typical'
DNA extraction protocols but use magnetic particle
separation technology to isolate DNA. As we are not
familiar or experienced with such technology, we would
like to ask if people that have/are using it would be so
kind to send us comments regarding: -generally how
satised you are, -which sample types are you extract-
ing (important as the the system might work well for
some sample types but not for others), -how good is
the DNA/extract in terms of quantity/quality/purity
(especially when extracting from samples that might
contain PCR inhibitors [e.g. plant/fungi material]), -has
anybody tried this extraction system with non-invasive
samples (e.g. isolating DNA from faeces) or generally
samples with low DNA content (e.g. swab samples),
-has anybody carried out the extractions with home-
made buers (especially wash buers) and if so, would
they be willing to share them (or indicate if they are
available online as papers or other), -Any other pros
and cons would be very welcome, I'll of course repost
all collected info here on EvolDir in a few days.
Thanks in advance! Cheers,

ESEB CallGodfreyHewittAward
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2016 Call for Appli-
cations**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility grants for
young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Friday 15 January 2016, 12.00 GMT.
*Eligibility:*
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. The maximum single award will be
2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or
a period of research at a lab that you have not previ-
ously visited. There is no restriction on the country of
residence or nationality of the applicant. A report will
be required by 30 April 2017, by which time the funds
must have been used.
*Application procedure:*
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Friedrich at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from yourNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 113
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded from
your home institution or your proposed host institution.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Roger Butlin. The aim will be to announce decisions
before the end of March 2016.
The committee will consider the following key criteria:
1.The value of the proposed mobility in terms of its
expected output and impact on the applicant's career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant's existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant's own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant's career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.

The phylogenetic methods chapters are well written

all of your needs, but could be a good choice for the
phylogenetics part of your course. Since it's free, you
can incorporate it into your course without asking your
students to pay for two text books.
It does not cover gene and genome evolution to my
satisfaction, unfortunately.

I found another one: by Jobling et al, Human evolution-

good for undergraduates, with a summary, questions and

as the title says it is only about humans. Nevertheless,

InMemory MargaritaMetallinou
Dear Community,
It has been three months since Margarita's Metalli-
nou tragic loss that saddened the international commu-
nity. Dr. Margarita Metallinou was a very talented
and promising evolutionary biologist and herpetologist
whose career was just beginning to blossom. She com-
pleted her undergraduate studies at the University of
Athens in Greece, an MSc in Biodiversity at the Univer-
sity of Barcelona in Spain, and a PhD on the evolution
of desert Geckos at the Institute of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy in Barcelona in 2014. Thereafter, Margarita moved
to the United States where she began a postdoctoral
position at Villanova University. Tragically, Margarita's
life was cut short in a wildlife accident while conduct-
ing eldwork in Zambia, southern Africa, on July 2nd
2015. During her short but intense career, she inspired
many students around the world with her dedication
and passion for science, her tenacity, her boundless en-
ergy, her ability to help everyone around her, and her
determination to enjoy life and follow her dreams.
We would like to bring to your attention two initiatives
that have been developed by members of the community
in honor of Margarita:
a) The organizers of the EMBO practical course on
Computational Molecular Evolution have established
a 'Margarita Metallinou fee waiver award' for course
participants. Via this award the course organizers hope
to transmit Margarita's passion for research to future
generations of students and to preserve her memory:
http://events.embo.org/16-computational-evolution/
b) To commemorate Margarita's legacy, the Society for
the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles (SSAR) wishes
to establish a Postdoctoral Travel Award endowment
for one or more young researchers to attend the Soci-
ety's annual meetings. A crowd-funding eort has beenNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 115
initiated to support this endowment. *Please use the

Phylogenetic beta-diversity: a means to understand,
map and conserve spatial patterns of biological diversity
Catherine Graham (Stony Brook) Wednesday, Novem-
ber 4, 2015, 10:00 AM PST
Beta-diversity has long been recognized as an instrumen-
tal diversity measure providing insight as to how and
why diversity varies across space. Beta-diversity also
underlies most complementarity-based reserve design
algorithms which quantify the extent to which an area
contributes unrepresented features to an existing area
or set of areas. In the early 2000 researchers startedto recognize that beta-diversity could be extended to
include phylogenetic information. By accounting for
shared evolutionary history among assemblages/regions
phylogenetic beta-diversity can provide insights into
both the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms in-
uencing variation in species diversity and the best
way to conserve phylogenetic diversity in a reserve sys-
tem. In this seminar I will begin by briey reviewing
various denitions and approaches to measuring and
mapping beta-diversity. Then I will use a series of ex-
amples to show some of the new insights phylogenetic
beta-diversity has provided to both basic science and
conservation.

Dear All!
Please note that I have changed the license agreement of
my TREEFINDER software (www.treender.de): Start-
ing from 1st October 2015, I do no longer permit the
usage of my TREEFINDER software in the following EU
countries: Germany, Austria, France, Netherlands, Bel-

that together host most of the non-european immigrants.
For all other countries, the old license agreement re-
mains valid. USA has already been excluded from using
Treender in February 2015. This is all in accordance
with the license agreement stated in the TREEFINDER
manual since the earliest versions, which reserves me
the right to change the license agreement at any time.
I can do this because Treender is my own property.
On the TREEFINDER download website I have col-

some in English language.
I will check who is using Treender and I may sue the
license violators. I will, however, make exceptions for

Volunteer Research Assistant position
Causes of individual variation in cooperative investment
in the Damaraland Mole-Rat
I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge
and Im looking for a volunteer research assistant to
carry out exciting experiments with captive Damara-
land mole-rats, Fukomys damarensis. The study site is
at the Kuruman River Reserve, in the South African
Kalahari Desert.
My research, investigates the causes of individual vari-
ation in cooperative behaviour. I am particularly in-
terested in whether and how varied social experiences
throughout life can generate dierences in development
and behavioural prole. At the physiological level, I
investigate whether such social inuences on individ-
ual phenotypical plasticity are mediated by hormones
and ultimately question the adaptive relevance of both
within and between individual variations in cooperative
investments. Further information about the experiments
will be provided on interview.
I am looking for applicants available for a 12 months
period starting as soon as possible. Shorter availabilities
can also be considered. The position mainly involves
data collection (behavioural observations and collection
of blood, and urine samples). Other general tasks related
to animal handling (hormone injections and implants)
and husbandry and data handling will also be expected.
Working weeks will not exceed 45 hours. Applicants
should be hardworking, enthusiastic, physically t, and
prepared for long hours in the laboratory. The adver-
tised position is particularly suited for people aiming to
carry on their education with a PhD or a management
position in a research project. Successful applicants
can expect to gain invaluable experience in animal han-
dling procedures as well as in designing and conducting
experiment on a daily basis. They will be trained to
work with the software ObserverXT and Microsof Ac-
cess. They will be given the opportunity to conduct
a personal analysis project using our project database,
and for which I will supervise them.
Costs of food and accommodation while at the project
will be covered.

Volunteer opportunity
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and
ecology before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o'clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o'clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40 during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of a
small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance ofthe research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1400 (around 180 US$, 110 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$ / 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for two volunteers starting in December 2015/ January
2016. Volunteers are expected to stay at least three
months, but longer periods of up to 6months are pre-
ferred. We are also looking for volunteers for later in
2016.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-

Masters project in The adaptive role of the white
plumage coloration in the barn owl (Tyto alba)
Duration: 6-8 months Start: Negociable Location: Uni-
versity of Lausanne, Department of Ecology and Evolu-
tion, Le Biophore, 1015, Lausanne, Switzerland
Supervisors: Dr. Luis M. San-Jose
(luis.sanjosegarcia@unil.ch)
Project: White animal colourations are often maladap-
tive given that prey or predators can easily spot them in
most natural environments. However, white colorations
can be still found in nature when light-coloured back-
grounds are available, for instance, in bird predators
hunting against a clear sky or in animals living in habi-
tats often covered by snow. Barn owls often exhibit
an immaculate white ventral plumage, which is unique
among nocturnal birds of prey. However, barn owls
hunt and habit in habitats lacking any obvious light
background, and the function, if any, of such unusual
coloration remains a mystery. Recent ndings suggest
that the white plumage of the barn owl might have
evolved as a unique adaptation to increase hunting suc-
cess. However, certain aspects of this hypothesis still
need to be formally conrmed using eld and lab ex-
periments. The successful applicant will conduct both
eld and laboratory experiments with barn owls and
wild rodent species, respectively. The student will learn
how to design and conduct experiments in both eld
and laboratory circumstances and with fully dierent
species as well as to collect and analyse the data. The
study will provide new insights into a novel and rare
adaptation in the animal kingdom and into the mecha-
nisms that maintain colour variation in this ubiquitous
animal species.

Genotype-Phenotype associations in the worldwide dis-
tributed
owl family Tytonidae
Introduction: The evolution and maintenance of phe-
notypic variation is a central question in evolutionary
biology. Colour patterns play a relevant role in specia-
tion and adaptation, however it is not often studied at
the gene level. Certain species of the Tytonidae family of
barn owls vary continuously across continental gradients,
in the degree of pheomelanin-based ventral plumage
colouration. The Melanocortin System is often targeted
in pigmentation studies, given its role in the control
of melanin pigment synthesis, and for pleiotropically
regulating a number of physiological and behavioural
traits in vertebrates. A key MC1R non-synonymous
substitution was found in the European population,
which corresponds to a valine-to-isoleucine substitution,
where individuals carrying the I allele are redder, and ho-
mozygote VV individuals are whiter in the ventral areafeathers. Due to their cosmopolitan distribution and
striking variation in melanin-based colouration, this fam-
ily provides a unique opportunity for a worldwide study
on the evolution and maintenance of melanin-based
pigmentation between populations-subspecies-species,
using candidate genes.
Aim: The aims of this project are to: 1) search for can-
didate genes of plumage pigmentation in birds, and test
whether they are associated with the plumage colour
patterns observed worldwide in the family Tytonidae;
2) investigate how these genes evolved in the family.
Experimental Approach: You will have to do DNA ex-
tractions from tissue, PCR amplication of a number
of genes, sequence editing, cloning, phylogenetic com-
parative analysis and some simple models on R.
Signicance: This study will help to understand the
adaptive processes involved in the evolution of melanin-
based pigmentation.

Postdoc in population genomics of rapid adaptation
The laboratory of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen at Cor-
nell University is looking for a highly motivated postdoc
for a project on the genomic basis of rapid life-history
evolution. The project is returning to a seminal ex-
periment that demonstrated substantial evolution in
growth rate and a suite of correlated traits in response
to size-selective shing over just ve generations in theAtlantic silverside. Through low-coverage whole genome
sequencing of sh from the original experiment, we are
characterizing the genomic basis for the observed phe-
notypic changes. The primary task of the postdoc will
be to complement these results by examining genomic
signatures of natural variation in size-selection across
latitudes. Silversides experience a strong cline in natural
size-selection across its distribution range, which - de-
spite high levels of gene ow - has caused a high degree
of local adaptation in the same traits that evolved in
the experiment. The postdoc will use already generated
full exome sequence data from four wild populations to
search for signatures of natural selection, and will work
closely with the PI and collaborator Steve Palumbi at
Stanford University to compare these to the signatures
of rapid articial selection in the experiment. There will
also be opportunities for involvement in additional eld
sampling, quantitative genetic analysis, trait mapping
or draft genome assembly and annotation, depending
on the interests of the postdoc.
Qualications: A PhD in evolutionary genetics, molecu-
lar ecology, bioinformatics or a related eld is required.
We are looking for a creative and talented scientist with a
good publication record and excellent organizational and
communication skills. The successful candidate must
have a strong computational background and previous
experience with analyzing large population genomics

MicrobialDispersal
Postdoctoral position: Impact of dispersal on soil mi-
crobial ecology and evolution
A postdoc position is available at Imperial College Lon-
don (Silwood Park Campus) in the lab of Dr Thomas
Bell to understand how microbes disperse across land-
scapes. Previous work in the group has shown that
microbes have distinct biogeographical patterns (e.g.
Science, 2005, 308: 1884), and that dispersal plays a
major role in determining local community composition
(e.g. ISME Journal, 2010, 4:1357). The project will look
at how dispersal aects the distribution and abundance
of microbial genes and species, and will focus in particu-
lar on how microbes spill across habitat boundaries (e.g.
Ecology Letters, 2006, 9:603). The research will focus
on agricultural intensication as one key driver of soil
microbial community spillover.
The research will use three complementary approaches.
First, it will look at dispersal across miniature land-
scapes in laboratory microcosms. Second, it will track
dispersal across plot boundaries in long-term eld ex-
periments. Finally, it will conduct eld surveys across
habitat boundaries to look at patterns under natural
conditions. The research will focus on the bacterialcomponent but with the potential to extend to other
microbial groups. The research will include a combina-
tion of culture-based and molecular 'omics approaches,
and will inform and benet from theory relating to
source-sink dynamics.
The position is funded by a NERC grant awarded to Dr
Thomas Bell, Professor Jason Tylianakis, and Profes-
sor Mick Crawley. The successful applicant will join a
large microbial ecology group at the Silwood Park Cam-
pus. There is also the exciting opportunity to interact
with project partners Professor Bob Holt (University of
Florida), Dr Noah Fierer (University of Colorado), and
Dr Rob Griths (CEH Wallingford).
You must have a PhD (or equivalent) in ecology, evo-
lution, microbiology, or a closely related discipline. A
strong background in conducting eld or laboratory ex-
periments using soil microbes and a strong background
in community ecology are essential. You must also have
experience with 'omics approaches to microbial surveys.
While not essential, experience with ow cytometry, soil
functional measurements (e.g. respirometry, enzyme
assays), and isolating bacteria or other microbes from
natural environments, would be an advantage.
You must have excellent verbal and written communica-
tion skills, and be able to write clearly and succinctly for
publication. You must also be able to relate well with
others, form positive relationships with a wide range of
people and to work as part of a team, as well as indepen-
dently. The ability to develop and apply new concepts
and have a creative approach to problem-solving will be
required.
This is a full-time, xed-term position and is available
until 28 December 2018.

CancerResistanceEvolution
Post-doc position in Montpellier on cancer resistance in
wildlife species
Cancer is a disease associated with clonal evolution and
cell competition within the body and appeared with the
transition to multicellularity more than half a billion
years ago. Assessing natural selection in human popula-
tions is challenging, but indications of how it may have
moulded human cancer incidence can be assessed by
exploring the rules that govern incidences of cancers in
wildlife species. Specically, we need to understand the
mechanisms underlying the so-called \Peto's paradox"
the absence of a correlation across species between can-
cer and body size ~A longevity. Understanding how large,
long-lived species overcome the burden of cancer can
indeed provide critical insights into the identication of
processes that prevent carcinogenesis.
The objectives of EvoCan project, funded by the Agence
Nationale de la Recherche (www.agence-nationale-
recherche.fr) are to understand theevolutionary causes
of Peto's paradox by exploring the relevance of several
novel hypotheses. The project builds on the research
program of the recently created CEECR Institute (Cen-
ter for Ecological and Evolutionary Cancer Research,
http://www.creec.fr) in Montpellier. During the rst
steps of this project, a large collection of unique datasets
has been collected, both at the inter-species and at the
intra-individual scales, which will represent an intriguing
opportunity to address this scientic question.
Within this context, we are seeking for a post-doctoral
fellow who will focus on theoretical modeling of Peto's
paradox based on the datasets collected. The ideal
candidate, supervised by Dr Benjamin Roche and Dr
Fr a^Ao^A~A^Acric Thomas, will be broadly trained in ecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology (PhD or equivalent degree
required), with strong expertise in theoretical modeling,
possibly with probabilistic methodology (branching pro-
cess) and/or Individual-Based Modeling. Prior research
experience on processes shaping cancerogenesis would
be greatly appreciated. This position is for 12 months,
with a possibility of an extension to 18 months, starting
ideally in early 2016, in MIVEGEC lab in Montpellier
(www.mivegec.ird.fr).
Interested candidates should apply by December 15 ^th

PopulationGenetics
Call for a postdoctoral researcher in population genetics
Summary. The Max Planck Institute for the Science of
Human History in Jena (Germany) is oering a position
for a full-time postdoctoral researcher in the eld of
population genetics. The position is tied to the Eura-
sia3angle research group. Funded by an ERC Consol-
idator Grant, this interdisciplinary group will work on
Millet and beans, language and genes. The origin and
dispersal of the Transeurasian family. The position is
for 4 years, beginning between April and September
2016. Candidates need to have completed a PhD and
be familiar with model-based approaches. If interested,
please send the application documents specied below
to the group's principal investigator, Martine Robbeets
(robbeets@shh.mpg.de) by January the 1st, 2016.
Project description. The overarching research topic of
the eurasia3angle project is the question about the ori-
gin and dispersal of the Transeurasian languages, i.e.
the Japonic, Koreanic, Tungusic, Mongolic, and Turkic
languages. The key objective is to integrate linguistic,
archaeological and genetic evidence in a single approach,
for which the term Triangulation is used. The intended
genetic analyses will examine whether the genetic rela-
tionships among Japanese, Korean, Tungusic, Mongolic
and Turkic populations are closer to each other than
those between Transeurasian and non-Transeurasian
groups. We wish to combine genome-wide analyses of
autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms with uni-
parental analyses of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal
DNA in a model-based approach. We intend to start
from publically available data. Unless there is no other
option available, we do not plan additional laboratory
work.It is our objective to bring the genetic evidence
together with the ndings obtained from linguisticsNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 133
and archaeology. Given the fact that a synthesis be-
tween the three disciplines is still in its infancy, we
intend to work out a consistent methodology of triangu-
lation. For more information on the project please visit
our project website http://www.shh.mpg.de/102128/-
eurasia3angle group ProleApplicants should have com-

1.) Post-doctoral Position in Plant Systems Biology
New York University Center for Genomics and Systems
Biology
A post-doctoral position at NYU's Center for Genomics
and Systems Biology - in the laboratory of
Dr. Gloria Coruzzi - is available as part of our NSF
Plant Genome Grant entitled: NutriNet: A network
inspired approach to improving Nutrient Use Eciency
(NUE) in crop plants.
The successful applicant will have skills and experi-
ence in Genomics and Bioinformatics. The position
will require both experimental and computational skills
for the generation and analysis of NextGen datasets.
Skills in R, Perl, Python or other programming lan-
guage are strongly preferred. This position also includes
Project Management duties, which involve coordinating
scientic activities at two participating institutions; or-
ganizing group meetings, writing grant reports, paper
writing and communicating our work in conferences and
meetings.
This project involves the collaboration of plant system-
atists, molecular biologists, genome scientists and bioin-
formaticians. PI: Gloria Coruzzi (PI), NYU, Center for
Genomics & Systems Biology; Dennis Shasha (co-PI)
NYU, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences; &
Stephen Moose (co-PI) U. Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
Institute for Genomic Biology.
Overview: Recent advances in genome sequencing, func-
tional genomics, and computational tools enable a
systems-level understanding of key physiological and
developmental processes in the model plant Arabidopsis,
but translating this knowledge to enhancing agricul-
turally important phenotypes in crop species remains
challenging. The goal of our NutriNet project is to de-
velop network-connected modules in crops- exploiting
Arabidopsis network knowledge - that are predictive
of phenotypic variation and enhance the eciency of
genetic gain in crop species, using nutrient use eciency(NUE) of maize as the target trait. Four aims are pro-
posed to achieve these goals. First, new and existing
data for nutrient-responsive gene expression proles will
be integrated with phenotypic variation for NUE to
develop a training set that exploits the power of genetic
diversity from both Arabidopsis (Coruzzi, NYU) and
maize (Moose, Illinois). Second, a split-root experi-
mental design combined with RNASeq (Coruzzi) will
identify Arabidopsis and maize genes that function in
root-shoot N-signaling and that control root foraging
for nutrients. The third aim is to construct the Nu-
triNet for maize (Coruzzi/Shasha, NYU), which will be
combined with Arabidopsis network knowledge to dene
network modules predictive of NUE traits. NutriNet
modules will be validated using left-out data and tests
of predictive ability in genotypes outside of the initial
training set. Finally, information derived from NutriNet
modules will be used to select individual genotypes that
possess optimal NutriNet congurations from diverse
germplasm pools, which will then be evaluated for im-
proved NUE traits in the lab (Arabidopsis) and eld

SalmonMateChoice
Postdoctoral Research Position in Evolutionary Genetics
of Mate Choice among Salmon
Research Associate (Post Doc) holds a leadership role
among a larger research team comprised of Oregon State
University (OSU), Oregon Department of Fisheries and
Wildlife (ODFW), Northwest Fisheries Science Center
(NWFSC, NOAA) and Abanathy Fish Technology Cen-
ter (USFWS) partners involved in cooperative research
that specializes in dening mechanisms that may cre-
ate dierences between hatchery and wild salmonids,
recommending strategies to manage those dierences
while meeting shery and conservation objectives, and
educating Oregonians on the role and performance of
hatcheries in supporting and protecting Oregon's native
sh and sheries.
The primary responsibility of this position is to perform
genomic analysis on an established coho salmon pedigree
to determine if observed dierences between hatchery
and wild tness (as assessed from full lifetime relative re-
productive success) can be explained by additive and/or
non-additive eects of mate selection. Hatcheries in Ore-
gon randomly mate male and female sh to avoid bias.
If ospring survival dierences can be associated with
successful mate selection in the wild, then being able to
understand that selection and mimic it in the hatchery
could lead to hatchery sh (with better reproductive
success) having a lower risk to wild populations from in-
terbreeding. Initial research goals will determine if mate
selection is important to ospring survival by genomic
examination of pairings of WildxWild, WildxHatchery
and HatcheryxHatchery coho salmon from Calapooya
Creek whose success at producing ospring is known.
If analyses demonstrate that most successful matings
can be associated with specic multi-locus genetic com-
binations observed among most successful mate pairs,
then genetic markers for relevant traits will be identied
and methods to rapidly identify them developed. These
rapid identication methods will then be applied to de-136 EvolDir November 1, 2015
ne mating combinations among wild and/or hatchery
sh in a hatchery. Relative reproductive success in the
wild of these sh will be compared with reproductive
success of normal, random hatchery matings to deter-
mine if 'wild-sh-like' targeted mating in the hatchery
reduces the loss of reproductive success for hatchery
sh, and the impact of current hatchery practice on
wild populations. Overall results of this research may
lead to new procedures for mating sh in a hatchery
program that can reduce the risk hatchery sh have on
wild populations.

SwanseaU FishIntrogression
Postdoctoral position in Fish Epigenetic Introgression
at Swansea University
We are looking for 1 Postdoctoral Research Fellow to
explore the role of epigenetic modications in the in-
trogression between farm and wild salmon. It has long
been recognised that the introduction of Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar L.) from captive populations in the wild,
mainly through escapes from sh farms threaten the
genetic integrity of natural populations through genetic
introgression. Although domesticated salmon seem to
have in general poor reproductive success, farm mature
parr can have higher rates of fertilisation success than
their wild counterparts, acting as vehicles of introgres-
sion, and in fact gametes of farm salmon are functionally
similar to those of wild ones. Populations invaded by
farm escapes show signs of signicant genetic change
and interbreeding between farm and wild salmon result
in dierences in the gene expression associated with
environmental change and immune response. Yet, the
mechanisms regulating these changes remain unknown.
It has been recently documentation that sperm (but not
oocytes) epigenetic signatures are maintained in the in
the embryos of zebra sh, if this was conserved in other
sh the consequences of farm-wild introgression could
be more profound that previously thought. Epigenet-
ics mechanisms explain how heritable (and potentiallyreversible) changes in gene expression can contribute
to phenotypic diversity in populations through mech-
anisms that do not alter the underlying genetic code.
This opens the door to a new potential vehicle of farm-
wild interactions: epigenetic introgression that could
further compromise locally adapted salmon populations.
This project will provide data to clarify whether rear-
ing in captivity can translate in epigenetic changes in
the sperm of A. salmon that can be maintained in the
embryo, representing a vehicle of introgression between
farm and wild populations.
The project is funded by BBSRC-NERC and the post
is available for 12 months stating November 2015 (al-
though there is certain exibility in the starting date)
and based in Swansea University (Dr Sonia Consuegra,
Prof Carlos Garcia de Leaniz) in collaboration with the
University of Highlands and Islands (Prof Eric Verspoor,
Dr Mark Coulson). At Swansea the Fellow will join a
dynamic group (3 postdocs, 7 PhD students) working
on a range of topics in Evolutionary Ecology including
epigenetic basis of sh domestication, genetic and epige-
netic basis of disease resistance under inbreeding, novel
methods for detection of invasive species and modelling
of dispersal.

SequenceAnalysis
Post-doc in population epigenetics and epigenomics
A post-doc position is available in the Johannes group
(www.johanneslab.org) at the Technical University Mu-
nich. Description: DNA methylation is an important epi-
genetic mark with fundamental roles in gene regulation
and transposable element silencing. In plant genomes,
aberrant DNA methylation changes (i.e. epimutations)
can arise spontaneously, similar to DNA sequence mu-
tations. Unlike in animals, these epimutations are often
transmitted across many generations and have been
shown to contribute to the heritability of important
plant traits. It remains unclear to which extent epimu-
tations contribute to plant evolution, and whether they
are exploitable in agricultural breeding programs. One
current aim of our group is to quantify the genetic and
environmental factors that shape the rate and the molec-
ular spectrum of spontaneous epimutations in the model
plant A. thaliana. In collaboration with other groups we
are in the processes of setting up several experimental
systems that will allow us to study these questions in
depth. We will use whole genome bisulphite sequencing
(WGBS) to measure the methylomes of a large number
of A. thaliana lines.
What are we looking for: We are looking for a tal-
ented post-doc who will take charge of the analy-
sis and interpretation of a large number of WGBS
datasets. The applicant would make use of and com-
bine several in-house computational algorithms into a
single analysis pipeline. We have a strong preference
for bioinformaticians/computational biologists with a
deep appreciation for biological phenomena or, alter-
natively, experimentalists with a solid background in
bioinformatics/computational biology. For specic in-
quiries regarding this position contact Frank Johannes
at work@johanneslab.org.
Location: We are embedded in the Plant Sciences depart-
ment within the TUM School of Life Sciences located
(Freising campus). We are also part of the prestigious
TUM Institute for Advanced Study. The TUM is rated
among the best in Germany and ranked well interna-
tionally. The Freising Life Sciences campus is located
about 20 minutes from the city center of Munich and
10 minutes from the Munich international airport. The

Starting date is January 2016, but applications will be
accepted until the position is lled.
Salary: The position is funded initially for 2 years with
a possible extension. The salary is 75%-100% of a stan-

structure of Central Andean populations. Beyond this
general point we are interested in approaching a num-
ber of other factors relevant for the population history
of South America using paleogenomic tools, including
health/ disease and human adaptation to stress fac-
tor acting in high altitude. The Postdoctoral Scholar
will be expected to use paleogenomic and population
genetic/computational techniques to explore the popu-
lation history of South America and beyond and prefer-

*Post-Doctoral Position at the University of Kentucky*
*Project: *Funding is available for a post-doc to build
theoretical models that integrate Integrated Pest Man-
agement (IPM) tactics with Insect Resistance Manage-
ment (IRM), considering eco-evolutionary and metapop-
ulation dynamics of adaptation. We aim to integrate
past knowledge of pest systems with new modeling
paradigms to identify novel solutions for insect resis-
tance management. In particular, we seek to develop a
modelling approach that simultaneously considers spa-
tial and temporal variation in resistance evolution in a
meta-population context. These models will consider
dispersal, density-dependent population dynamics, types
of refuge, crop rotations, insecticide applications, and
biocontrol strategies to identify novel resistance manage-
ment methodologies that may improve pest suppression
and the extend the life of pest control products. The
developed models will provide a theoretical framework
to generate and test hypotheses concerning resistance
evolution and will consider pest and natural enemy biolo-
gies, crop spatial and temporal heterogeneity, insecticide
applications, and interactions among these processes.
Funding is also available (starting in year 3) to do eld
experiments testing hypotheses generated from the de-
veloped models. Additional details about the project
are available upon request.
*Qualications:*Interested individuals must have a PhD
in ecology, evolutionary biology, entomology or a related
eld with expertise in modeling of ecological and/or evo-
lutionary dynamics, particularly in a metapopulation
context.
*Hiring:*Preferred start date is January 2016 or as soon
thereafter as possible. Initial funding is for one year;
funding for years 2 and 3 depends upon satisfactory
completion of the Year 1 goals. Salary is dependent on
experience.
*Research PIs*: Research funding for this project was
awarded to Charles Fox (http://www.uky.edu/ ~cfox/),

I am looking to recruit a new postdoctoral fellow to the
lab. This is not a position on an existing grant but would
instead be support for (at least) one year while we work
together to seek an externally funded fellowship. This
therefore represents an opportunity to work creatively
on a new self-directed project that articulates well with
other existing lab activities. I am particularly interested
in nding someone who interested (in part) in working
with the large amounts of functional and population
genomic data that we are currently generating. Some
mixture of bioinformatics, theory, and/or experimental
approaches using nematodes as a model system would
therefore ideal for the postdoctoral project.
If interested, the candidate would also have the oppor-
tunity to teach in our new Bioinformatics and Genomics
Masters Program, as well as to help me teach a new sys-
tems genomics course that I am putting together. The
lab currently has NIH funded projects oriented around
the systems genetics and experimental evolution of nat-

Schoville's lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
in collaboration with Dr. Yolanda Chen (University
of Vermont) and Dr. David Hawthorne (University of
Maryland).
Summary:
Understanding the mechanisms underlying rapid evolu-
tionary change, particularly at the scale of the whole
genome, is an important challenge for both theoretical
and applied evolutionary biology. This project focuses
on the Colorado potato beetle, and its relatives, to un-
derstand the structural and functional genomic changes
associated with the beetle's host range expansion onto
potato, the colonization of novel climatic regimes, and
the rapid development of insecticide resistance (to over
50 classes of insecticides!). With a dataset comprising
100 whole genomes, this is an excellent opportunity to
publish a number of high-prole research papers.
Position Responsibilities:
The post-doctoral associate will have the opportunity to
analyze whole-genome resequence data to assess the pop-
ulation genomics and structural genomic changes across
a diverse sample of Colorado potato beetle genomes.
This project will provide training opportunities in bioin-
formatics analysis, population genetic modeling and
phylogenomic analysis. Desirable skills for this project
include familiarity with Linux operating systems and
computer programming (Perl, Python, and/or R), as
well as previous experience analyzing population genetic156 EvolDir November 1, 2015
data.

(analysis of data). He/she will be responsible for all
steps ranging from DNA extraction, amplication, se-
quencing, continuous analysis and quality control of
newly added data, submission of sequences to online
repositories, submission of DNA to ZFMK Biobank, to
the nal publication in a high-quality journal. Capacity
for additional independent manipulation and analysis
of the data is welcome and encouraged.
We oer a dynamic and motivating environment and ex-
ible working hours, in a department with several young
and active researchers working on dierent arthropod
groups. Bonn is a small but attractive international city.

datasets to answer genetic, demographic and evolution-
ary questions.
The course will alternate theory with practical com-
puter exercises but it will focus on hands-on training.
Although examples will be based on single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) data in human individuals, most
topics covered in this course can be extended to other
types of markers and organisms.

Statistics Course - Stable Isotope Mixing Models
(SIMMs) using SIAR, SIBER AND MixSIAR
This course will be run from January 12th - 15th 2016
at SCENE (Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural
Environment), in Loch Lomond National Park, Glasgow,
United Kingdom
This course will cover the concepts, technical background
and use of stable isotope mixing models (SIMMs) with a
particular focus on running them in R. Recently SIMMs
have become a very popular tool for quantifying food
webs and thus the diet of predators and prey in an
ecosystem. Starting with only basic understanding of
statistical models, we will cover the dos and don'ts of
using SIMMs with a particular focus on the widely used
package SIAR and the new, more advanced MixSIAR.
Participants will be taught some of the advanced features
of these packages, which will enable them to produce
a richer class of output, and are encouraged to bring
their own data sets and problems to study during the
round-table discussions.
Curriculum:
Day 1: Basic concepts
Class 1: Introduction; why use a SIMM?
Class 2: An introduction to Bayesian Statistics.
Class 3: Dierences between regression models and
SIMMs.

and t statistical models
Round table discussion: understanding the output from
a Bayesian model
Day 2: Understanding and using SIAR
Class 1: Dos and Don'ts of using SIAR
Class 2: The statistical model behind SIAR
Practical: Using SIAR for real-world data sets; report-
ing output; creating richer summaries and plots of the
results

INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR BIOLOGISTS
This course is being delivered by Dr Martin Jones, an
expert in Python and author of two text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners
/dp/1492346136/]
Advanced Python for Biologists [http://-
www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/14952 44377/].
The course will run from 1st - 5th of February 2016 at
SCENE (the Scottish Centre for Ecology and the
Natural Environment), Loch Lomond National Park,

Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable lan-
guage that is a popular platform for all types of bioin-
formatics work, from simple one-o scripts to large,
complex software projects. This workshop is aimed at
complete beginners and assumes no prior programming
experience. It gives an overview of the language with an
emphasis on practical problem-solving, using examples
and exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinfor-
matics work. After completing the workshop, students
should be in a position to (1) apply the skills they have
learned to tackle problems in their own research and (2)
continue their Python education in a self-directed way.
Intended audience:
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background:164 EvolDir November 1, 2015
Students should have enough biological background to
appreciate the examples and exercise problems (i.e. they
should know about DNA and protein sequences, what
translation is, and what introns and exons are). No
previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary,
but you'll need to have a laptop with Python installed.

Phd Course: Chemical and Genomic Insight to Host-
Microbe Symbiotic Interactions
Link: http://www.nmbu.no/en/students/nova/-
students/phd-courses/phd-2016/node/23615 NOVA
PhD course of 2.5 ECTS, organised by Henrik Hjarvard
de Fine Lich and Michael Poulsen, University of
Copenhagen.
Dates and location: 23-27 May 2016 in Copenhagen,
Denmark.
Course Description Advances over the past years have
provided a range of genomic and chemical tools appli-
cable to research in host-symbiont interactions. This
course will introduce and critically address these tools
with the primary objective of providing PhD students
with extensive knowledge of the applicability of tools
to their own work. The course mainly addresses PhD
students early in their PhD and who work with inter-
actions between hosts and symbionts at the molecular
level.
Content Symbioses are omnipresent and play major roles
in the ecology and evolution of the organisms involved.
The course will provide an overview of the diversity of
symbiotic systems with particular focus on examples,
where genomics and chemical tools have been employed
to shed new light on interactions. Students will be
introduced to applicable methodologies in microbial
interaction research.
Programme Outline Each course day will have a specic
theme.
* Monday: introduction and lectures and workshops
on symbiosis, ending with student presentations of
their PhD projects. * Tuesday: genomics and metage-
nomics. * Wednesday: transcriptomics and proteomics
approaches. * Thursday: signalling molecules and nat-
ural products. * Friday: student presentations on har-
vesting workshop results.
Learning Outcomes Knowledge on:
* The formation, maintenance and evolution of bene-
cial symbioses. * The importance of cross talk and
signalling in symbioses. * Genomic and analytical tools
that can be applied to answer questions in symbioses,166 EvolDir November 1, 2015
and how these can be used in an interdisciplinary way.
Skills to:
* Identify tools to apply to their own (and peers') re-
search. * Find literature and tools in symbioses research.
* Use online tools to analyse (meta)genomes. * Get an
overview about possible new aspects and solutions to
their PhD projects. * Get to know new collaboration
partners.
Competences to:
* Assess opportunities and limitations of genomic and
analytical tools. * Critically evaluate published work,
other's work and their own work. * Develop new ideas
for projects of their own and of peers.
Pre-/Post-Campus Assignments Pre-Campus Back-
ground reading, preparation of questions for specic
topics, preparation of short presentation of PhD the-
sis/topic, and preparation of own data sets to work on
during the workshop.
Post-Campus An online evaluation form will be pro-
vided to students to evaluate the course outcome, and
the students will be provided with contacts information
for each other and teachers to immediately expand their
international research network.
Evaluation Elements The course will require active par-
ticipation enforced through presentations by each stu-
dent, which can readily be evaluated. Short presenta-
tions on the progress students have made in incorporat-
ing the topics covered to their own research questions
will be required, so that students have to be actively
engaged during the week to be able to put this together.
Pedagogical Approach The course will combine tradi-
tional lectures, online tools, computer exercises, and
student presentations to uphold diverse approaches that
satisfy dierent learning modes. All components will re-
quire active participation, as this is expected to facilitate
deeper learning. To maximize teaching styles, student
tasks will also be diverse, as they will work individually
and in groups, train presentation skills, and be stimu-
lated to critical thinking by sparring ideas. Estimated
Workload
* 15 hours seminar * 15 hours lecture * 15 hours ex-
ercises * 30 hours reading before the course, making
presentations before and during the course
Prerequisite Knowledge Course participants should be
enrolled in a PhD with a strong focus on biology, bio-
chemistry, agriculture or bioinformatics, and ideally
work with a question related to host-symbiont interac-
tions in their own research, but the course will also be
relevant for students considering host-symbiont research.Admission Admission for NOVA courses is handled by
the course organiser/ the NOVA member institution
organising the course. Please see the links in the margin
for more information.

Nov15-20
Winter school Linking Community and Ecosystem Dy-
namics: nal programme
The Research School Ecology & Evolution of the Gronin-
gen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES,
University of Groningen) is organizing a Winterschool
for international PhD students and Postdocs on Linking
Community and Ecosystem Dynamics. The school will
be held in the University eld station 'Herdershut' on
the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog from November
15 - 20 2015.
Scope of the course
The research elds community and ecosystem ecology
have diverged more or less independently over the last
decennia. Progress is made in understanding shifts in
community composition under the inuence of environ-
mental change and how these shifts can be explained
by functional trait approaches of component species.
Studies in ecosystem ecology traditionally have a strong
focus on energy and nutrient uxes and how deviation
in these uxes aect ecosystem functioning and stability.
Recent studies reveal tight links between these sub-
disciplines that enforce us to rethink how communities
and ecosystems interact.
This course focuses on theoretical concepts such as auto-
catalytic loops and feedbacks between organisms, ther-
modynamics in species interactions and the importance
of ecosystem engineers. We will explore how these prin-
ciples can be used to link communities to ecosystems inNovember 1, 2015 EvolDir 167
order to understand how environmental change aects
community and ecosystem dynamics.
Course lecturers include Prof. Neil Rooney (U. of
Guelph), Prof. Han Ol (U. of Groningen), Prof. Matty
Berg (Free University Amsterdam), Prof. Tjeerd Bouma
(Netherlands Institute for Sea Research).

Course description
This course on Landscape Genetics provides a unique op-
portunity for interdisciplinary training and provides an
overview of the eld of landscape genetics. The course
caters to students in both basic and applied ecology,
especially conservation/population genetics, landscape
ecology and conservation biology. A key objective of
landscape genetics is to study how landscape modica-
tion and habitat fragmentation aect organism dispersal
and gene ow across the landscape. Landscape genetics
requires highly interdisciplinary specialized skills mak-
ing intensive use of technical population genetic skills
and spatial analysis tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools
and remote sensing). Even when students receive dis-
ciplinary training in these areas, educational programs
often lack the necessary linkage and synthesis among
disciplines. This linkage can only be accomplished after
experts from each discipline work together to developguiding principles for this new research area.
Landscape Genetics will be concurrently oered at six
universities in North America and Europe giving stu-
dents the opportunity to learn from international ex-
perts and work with peers from outside institutions.
For students who are not members of the participating
institutions, we are oering a web-based online course
to reach a broader audience. Each course meeting will
start with a live web-cast lecture (no special software
required) by an expert on the topic that introduces foun-
dations and methods and highlights points for discussion
in local seminar groups. After breaking out into local
course group discussion (including a discussion group for
online course students), a web-based discussion across
campuses will wrap up the weekly topic. Students who
are unable to make it to live-cast of lectures can view
taped lectures. In addition, students can choose to
participate in an optional lab section using R and/or
interdisciplinary group term projects with web-based
collaboration across institutions. The nal two options
are provided to help students develop analytical skills in
Landscape Genetics. Students who participate in group
projects will have the option of applying to attend a
project synthesis meeting in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in
May 2016.
Course topics
- Landscape genetics framework, Measuring gene ow,
Alternative views of landscapes - Spatial analysis frame-
work, Identifying discrete populations - Incorporating
landscape data, Matrix resistance approaches in land-
scape genetics - Distance-based methods, Model se-
lection and validation - Role of simulation modeling,

StructuralEquationModelling
Dec14-18
We are pleased to announce a postgraduate course on
Structural Equation Modelling, organised by the Gradu-
ate School for Production Ecology and Resource Conser-
vation (PE&RC) of Wageningen University, Netherlands.
The course will take place from Monday 14 to Friday 18
December 2015 at Wageningen University Campus. This
course will be lectured by Professor Bill Shipley, who
is one of the leading international experts in the eld
of Path Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling.
Registration is now open at www.pe-rc.nl/sem! Scope:
While much of statistics focusses on associations between
variables and making predictions, the aim of structural
equation modelling is to establish causal relationships
between variables. In spite of the common belief that
any causal statement requires randomized experiments,
there is an increasing body of theory, methodology and
software which enables scientists to draw certain types
of causal conclusions from observational data. This has
important advantages, especially in cases where ran-
domized experiments are not feasible. Notably, causal
models allow the quantication of intervention eects,
which is the response of the system given a certain value
of one your variables (e.g. gene knock-out, rainfall).
This new course will explain the key concepts under-
lying causal inference, the required assumptions, and
how the interpretation of results diers from the case of
randomized experiments. To ensure that you learn from
the best, we managed to get Prof. Bill Shipley from the
Universit ^A^A de Sherbrooke in Canada to come over to
Wageningen to actually give this course. Prof. Shipley
is the author of \Cause and correlation in biology: A
user^A^As guide to path analysis, structural equations,
and causal inference", which by many is seen as the
guide for working with Path Analysis and Structural
Equation Models. The focus will be on classical struc-
tural equation models with a small number of (latent)
variables, but we will also give an introduction to recent
developments on methodology for high-dimensional data.
Throughout the course we will discuss applications in
ecology, social sciences and genetics. Depending on the
background and interests of the participants we may
put a stronger emphasis on some of these applications.November 1, 2015 EvolDir 169
Participants are therefore encouraged to bring their own
data.
Programme: Day 1: Introduction and background of
structural equation models (SEM): causation versus
correlation, causal inference versus classical statistics.
Identiability and estimation for models without latent
variables.
Day 2: Testing and selecting your model: goodness of t
tests, model comparison, conrmatory and explanatory
models.
Day 3: Adding latent (unmeasured) variables to your
model; concept of latent variables, estimating SEMs
with latent variables.
Day 4: The estimation of causal eects revisited: causal
graphs, directed acyclic graphs and conditional indepen-
dence, d-separation and faithfulness. The d-sep test.
Day 5: Applications of SEMs in ecology and genomics,
e.g. causal inference for high-dimensional data with the
R-packages pcalg and qtlnet.

AdaptationBioinformatics
Feb28-Mar5
Winter School - Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics
(B@G 2016) VENUE: Alexander & Gerbi Hotel, Weggis,
Switzerland DATE: February 28th - March 5th 2016
The most up-to-date information is available here:
http://www.adaptation.ethz.ch/education/winter-
school-2016.html AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The
application of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies to non-model organisms is now well-
established and has unlocked new frontiers for research
on adaptation genomics. Despite recent technological
developments enabling an increasing number of projects
to use genome-scale data, the analysis of such complex
data sets still raises substantial analytical hurdles,
particularly for researchers with primarily an ecological
and evolutionary background. Bioinformatic pipelines
oer an invaluable resource to process genomic data,
but their underlying rationale often remains hard
to understand, which poses signicant challenges
for their rigorous use and accurate interpretation of
the results. The B@G Winter School provides an
opportunity for researchers to penetrate the 'black
box' behind the complex bioinformatics approaches
available for investigating adaptation genomics; from
the programs and assumptions necessary to produce
a high quality SNP dataset from raw NGS data, to
the in-depth interpretation of methods designed to
detect signature of selection, demographic patterns
and associations between genotypes and environment,
and/or phenotypes. B@G teachers are established
scientists with a primary role in the development of
widely used bioinformatic software. Consequently,
participants of the B@G Winter School will gain insight170 EvolDir November 1, 2015
into the foundations of these algorithms and what they
do to the data, and will also receive advices on best
practice in experimental design and analysis.
AUDIENCE The School is primarily aimed at evolution-
ary biologists who want to gain deeper knowledge on
state-of-the-art methods used to detect evolutionary pat-
terns from genome-wide nucleotide data. Applications
from early career researchers (PhD and post-doctoral
level), as well as faculty with a background in ecology,
evolution or genetics, will be considered. The workshop
is particularly aimed at candidates with experience of
the Unix environment and who have tried using bioinfor-
matic pipelines to analyse genomic data. Participants
will be requested to bring their own laptop with which
to connect to the server for the practical sessions.
Lessons will include lectures on the theoretical back-
ground of the programs and practical demonstrations
given by the instructor, followed by hands-on exercises
performed by the participants under guided supervision.
Computing activity will rely on individual connections
to the Genetic Diversity Centre (GDC, ETH Zurich)
server, which will provide resources for demonstrations
and practical training. Emphasis will be given to in-
terpreting the output of the programs, with time for
discussion to facilitate interactions between the instruc-
tor and the audience.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch). Weggis is a scenic town lo-
cated on the shore of Lake Lucerne in central Switzer-
land. The location was chosen to provide a friendly and
stimulating work environment. The area is known for
its relaxing character and peaceful mountain scenery.
COST Total fee for participants is 750.- CHF. This in-cludes tuition and accommodation in double rooms with
full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
at the Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop.
Accommodation in single rooms may be available upon
request and with additional costs.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
