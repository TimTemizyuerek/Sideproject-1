Online MicrobiomeBioinformatics
Jun7-11
Dear Evoldir Community,
The Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network
(https://biovcnet.github.io/) is an online community
of Early Career Researchers committed to reducing en-
try barriers into bioinformatics. In June 2021, we are
hosting a virtual conference. The goal of the confer-
ence is to provide a step-by-step open access series of
presentations that demonstrate state-of-the-art bioinfor-
matics pipelines within microbiome research. We want
to demonstrate to microbiologists everywhere how to
think about and approach complex biological questions
through the lens of microbiology.
*As a speaker you will have a chance to reach an interna-
tional audience and disseminate your research across mi-
crobiology disciplines. If you are interested in this oppor-
tunity, we ask that you ll out the self-nomination form
with more detailed information. https://forms.gle/-
Jgs9w4eG5Si5w9dW8 *
We are striving to make the conference as inclusive
as possible with specic plans to have a diverse set of
speakers across multiple microbiology sub-disciplines
with presentations that are accessible to individuals
across the world.
We envision these presentations as hour-long sem-
inars that detail the FULL bioinformatic methods
that happen in a body of research (1 or more
preprints/publications). We encourage the \full meth-
ods" to include hiccups, deadends, false positives, and
issues that made you want to scream. We are looking
for a \narrative" version of your research process. Itll be
important to illustrate the tools, the thought-processes,
your interpretation of results - all the scary stu - to
demonstrate the full workow. The Organizing Com-mittee will work with you as much (or as little) as you
want to help guide this narrative process.
An example presentation might be something like:
- Present your system - Present the overarching biology
question(s) - Start at the beginning - how many samples,
types of data, why those types of data? - The process!
First big checkpoint? Exciting leads that end up as a
deadend? Issues with a tool that you gured out? -
How do these individual pieces start to build to a result?
- Tie it up in a bow! - Raucous applause!
Additionally, the Organizing Committee will work with
the speakers to translate the methods in their presenta-
tion into an open format and/or workow to be hosted
on a suitable platform.

PhD studentship on the evolutionary genomics of sexual
trait expression in black grouse
With Prof Joe Homan (Bielefeld University, Germany),
Dr Carl Soulsbury (University of Lincoln, UK) and Prof
Kees van Oers (Netherlands Institute of Ecology and
Wageningen University, the Netherlands).
The PhD project Since Darwin rst coined the term
'^A Â¥sexual selection' ^A to explain the evolution of exag-
gerated male traits, we have come to understand the
complex interrelationships among these traits, the infor-
mation they encode and the life histories of the animals
they are embedded into. Sexual selection is built on the
idea that individual quality is signalled by the expression
of these traits, yet a clear mechanistic understanding of
the genetic architectures of sexual traits and the mecha-
nisms regulating sexual trait expression remains elusive.
We know that inbreeding is an important component of
individual quality, and several studies have documented
inbreeding depression for sexually-selected traits. More-
over, trait expression can be inuenced by dynamic
factors such as age and environmental variation, so epi-
genetic control mediated by body condition has been
proposed as a means of regulating genotype-dependent
sexual trait expression. Resolving long-standing evolu-
tionary questions about mate choice and sexual selection
therefore requires a fundamental understanding of the
genetic and epigenetic basis of sexual traits. This project
will combine the genomic inference of inbreeding with
genome-wide methylation analysis to investigate the ge-
netic and epigenetic mechanisms aecting sexual trait
expression and reproductive success in a classical lek
model system, the black grouse. Genomic estimates
of inbreeding will be used to quantify the impacts of
consanguinity on multiple sexual traits and to evaluate
the ' ^A Â¥genic capture' ^A hypothesis, which argues that
sexual traits are inuenced by the cumulative eects
of large numbers of loci distributed across the genome.
Finally, we will build upon a recent pilot study linking
heterozygosity to sexual trait expression via dieren-
tial DNA methylation (Soulsbury et al. 2017) by using
a genome-wide methylation assay, epi-GBS, to iden-
tify genome-wide epigenetic signatures associated with
inbreeding and sexual trait expression. Overall, this
project will tackle an important knowledge gap by com-12 EvolDir March 1, 2021
bining detailed data from multiple sexual traits over
individual lifespans with genomic and epigenetic data
in a classical lekking species. The PhD student will
therefore have a fantastic opportunity to tackle sexual
selection using a number of innovative and cutting-edge
approaches.
Applicant' ^As prole We seek a bright and highly moti-
vated student who holds a good rst degree and an M.Sc.
or equivalent in a relevant topic (e.g. molecular ecol-
ogy, population genomics, bioinformatics). The ideal
candidate will have strong quantitative skills, including
prociency in working in R and writing custom scripts.
Practical experience of working with next generation se-
quence data (e.g. RAD sequencing, SNP array or whole
genome resequencing) would be advantageous, but full
training will be provided. The candidate should also
be able to work both independently and as part of a
multidisciplinary team. A high standard of spoken and
written English is required.
The working environment The PhD student will be based
at the Department of Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld
University, Germany (www.uni-bielefeld.de/biologie/-
vhf/index.html). The department is the oldest of its
kind in Germany and currently hosts seven principal in-
vestigators, nine postdocs and 15 PhD students. It oers
a stimulating, supportive and highly international envi-
ronment as well as an excellent research infrastructure.
The working language of the Department is English.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with an attrac-
tive historical centre and easy access to the Teutoberger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It is an af-
fordable and pleasant city to live in and is well connected
to most major European cities.
This project is lab based and is located at Bielefeld Uni-
versity, but the PhD will also spend some time at the
University of Lincoln (https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home)
and at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (https://-
nioo.knaw.nl/en). The successful applicant will there-
fore benet from an integrative, multidisciplinary train-
ing that will prepare her/him very well for a scientic
career in behavioural ecology, molecular ecology and
population genomics.
Remuneration This generous PhD studentship is funded
by the German Science Foundation (DFG) for a period
of three years and includes health insurance. The pay
scale is TVL E13 (65%) which is roughly equivalent to
a minimum

of genome duplication in plants
Group of Ecological Genomics (Filip Kol a) Department
of Botany, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic
https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/ecolgen Whole genome du-
plication (polyploidization) is a dramatic genome-wide
mutation whose ubiquity across eukaryotes suggests an
adaptive benet, though no mechanism has been iden-
tied. In the project, the successful applicant will be
testing if WGD leads to phenotypic change that may
confer adaptation in natural plant populations. To move
beyond correlative studies, the work will combine eld
surveys, population ecology/genetics and targeted trans-
plant experiments towards model stress environment
(naturally toxic soil). The project will address the adap-
tive consequences of WGD over a hierarchy of levels:
phenotype, population and species. To isolate the net
eect of WGD, we will manipulate the mutation itself
via synthesis of neo-polyploid lineages and complement
the results by screen of adaptive potential of natural
polyploid lineages using comparative niche modeling.
We will build on our previous experimental and popu-
lation genomic research in wild Arabidopsis, however,
the PhD project will extend beyond this system to addi-
tional model plants in order to discern generality. The
student will join an established international team of
Ecological Genomics at the Department of Botany and
their position will be funded by a new ERC Starting
Grant DOUBLE ADAPT.
**The potential range of methodologies will be - eld-
work in natural populations and ploidy screening us-
ing ow cytometry - transplant experiments addressing
adaptive response towards model stress environment
(challenging soil) - experiments with experimentally syn-
thesized polyploid lineages to isolate the net eect of
WGD - statistical analysis of ecological, phenotypic and
optionally also population genomic data available for
the studied species a synthetic manner
**We oer - creative and supporting atmosphere in
international team of Ecological Genomics - monthly
salary of ~1000 EUR net, competitive within the city of
Prague (with subsequent rise with the progress of the
study duties) - additional experience through interna-
tional collaboration - work in the historical centre of a
vibrant cultural Prague cityMarch 1, 2021 EvolDir 13
**We require - strong motivation for interdisciplinary
research at the border of ecology, evolutionary biology
and population genetics - willingness for a team work
in an international moderately-sized research group - a
MSc degree in Biology or related elds (in summer 2021
at the latest)
**Desirable but not required - experience with design

SexDeterminationEvolution
Project description: The aim of the project is to exam-
ine the evolution of sex determination across amniotes,
a species-rich group, involving lineages with XX/XY,
ZZ/ZW or temperature-dependent sex determination.
Sex chromosomes evolved from a pair of autosomes,
where the emergence of a sex-determining locus trig-
gered gradual structural changes such as accumulation
of sexual antagonistic alleles, recombination arrest, ac-
cumulation of repeats, loss of functional genes and hete-
rochromatinization. This model represents the classical
paradigm for decades. Recently, large variability in sex
chromosomes was documented in non-model species,
questioning the role of previously assumed evolutionary
drivers and other aspects of sex chromosome dieren-
tiation. It remains unclear why amniote lineages dier
so substantially in the degree of dierentiation of sex
chromosomes. Using advanced genetic and genomic
methods, the PhD candidate will attempt to solve long
standing enigmas concerning the role of sexual antago-
nism, inversions and gene dose regulatory mechanisms
in the dierentiation rate of sex chromosomes in selected
lineages of amniote vertebrates.
Qualications: The applicant should possess Master
degree (or equivalent title) and a proven expertise in
a related eld of biology. A previous experience inmolecular genetics, cytogenetics and/or bioinformatics
(genomics/transcriptomics) is essential for a success-
ful PhD candidate. Good knowledge of the English
language is required.

AquaticEvolution
The goal of the PhD projectis to investigate how en-
vironmental warming may inuence competitive com-
munity assembly in phytoplankton. As lake ecosystems
warm, resource limitation may also become more se-
vere and together these abiotic changes individually
and interactively reshue communities. Importantly,
environmental temperature may fundamentally alter
how taxa respond to resource availability in their envi-
ronment (at the cellular level) and may thereby alter
competitive hierarchies and dynamics among species.
The experiments planned for this project therefore aim
to tie together eects of warming at multiple levels of
biological organization from cells to communities and
ecosystems.
The selected PhD candidate willrun a combination of
lab microcosm and eld mesocosm experiments and use
these experiments to test theoretical predictions from
dynamical models of competition. The candidate will
also test the ability of phytoplankton competitive traitsto explain historical natural time series data of phyto-
plankton communities and environmental variables in
Swiss lakes over periods of warming and oligotriphica-
tion. The experiments will generate knowledge of the

Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) that aims to take ad-
vantage of recent developments in genomic sequencing
to gain new insights into a major milestone in evo-
lution: the emergence of sociality. The transition to
sociality that exists across termites and their nearest
cockroach relatives represents a powerful framework forunderstanding the genomic changes behind this signi-
cant evolutionary transition. The main objective of the
project is to sequence, assemble and annotate platinum-
grade genomes from a range of representative species
spanning the origin and subsequent diversication of
termites. These data will be used to investigate the
molecular mechanisms underpinning the evolution of
termite eusociality and to elucidate the origins of ter-
mite division of labour. Genomes will be combined
with transcriptomic as well as proteomic data to further
explore the evolutionary origins of termite sociality.
The project will be carried out as a close collaboration
between Prof. Dino McMahon (FU Berlin) and Dr.
Mark Harrison from the University of M unster.
Responsiblities: Research in the eld of genomics, with
emphasis on genomic drivers of termite sociality; Prepa-
ration and analysis of transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and

We anticipate having two funded, 2.5 year MS positions
starting Fall (August) 2021 to study the evolution of
the peripheral olfactory system in plethodontid sala-
manders at the morphological and molecular level, with
the underlying question being how they adapt to smell
in both water and air. Plethodontid salamanders have
a variety of life history modes, ranging from larvae
with metamorphosis, to direct development, to neoteny,
making them ideal to examine the adaptation of the
olfactory system to water vs. air as olfactory media.
This integrative project will involve eld-collecting of
animals and laboratory analysis of the olfactory system
using techniques such as histology, electron microscopy,
microCT analysis, immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization. For more information about the HSU

EVOMET
The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology The Re-
search Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) is one
of the world's leading basic biomolecular research in-
stitutes, located at the thriving and interdisciplinary
Vienna BioCenter. The Vienna BioCenter hosts 1900
scientists from over 70 nations, cultivating a dynamic
and collaborative work environment.
Researchers at the IMP conduct curiosity-driven re-
search across a wide range of topics in molecular cell
biology, developmental and regeneration biology, im-
munology, and cancer research, with the aim to under-
stand the mechanisms of life.
The group
The Obenauf lab focuses on understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying tumor progression and metas-
tasis and employs a wide array of molecular biology,
biochemistry, and in vivo approaches to understand
molecular determinants of response and resistance to
targeted and immunotherapies and identify new thera-
peutic entry-points.
The project Understanding how the immune system
aects cancer progression remains one of the funda-
mental questions in cancer biology and is crucial for
the development of eective therapies. To dissect the
molecular mechanisms of immune evasion and their
emergence during tumour dormancy and metastatic col-
onization, we will use established metastasis models
combined with a novel technique we have developed, uti-
lizingCRISPRatotraceclones inheterogeneous cell popu-
lations (CaTCH; Umkehrer et al.Nature Biotechnology,
2020). CaTCH enables lineage tracing of millions of
cells with stably integrated DNA barcodes (BCs). Im-
portantly, activation of a reporter allows FACS-based
isolation of clones with distinct phenotypes of interest
(i.e. tumour cells that stay dormant or escape dormancy
in an immune-competent or -decient background), en-
abling their mechanistic workup. We will assess the
immune-contexture, mutational load and the transcrip-
tional programs in theselectedcancer cell clones and
theirpre-selectioncounterparts. By integrating clinical
data, we will identify candidate mediators of these phe-18 EvolDir March 1, 2021
notypes, probe their role in functional metastasis assays
(gain/loss of function) and dissect the underlying mech-
anisms.
The candidate A strong interest in tumour evolution,
metastasis and cancer immunology is an essential pre-
requisite, as is passion and perseverance in equal mea-
sure. The successful candidate for this position should:
Be highly motivated, curious and have a pro-active
mindset.
Have a critical mindset to analyze her/his results and
be able to work independently, while receiving support
and mentoring from their supervisor.

Parasite evolution.
The laboratory has extensive expertise in parasitology,
molecular biology and bio-informatics, and pioneered re-
search on Leishmania genome diversity. The unit opens
a full-time PhD researcher position within the context
of a research project funded by the Flemish Research
Council (FWO).
The project aims at understanding the evolutionary his-
tory and epidemiology of L. braziliensis, a protozoan
parasite that is the major cause of (muco-)cutaneous
leishmaniasis in Central and South America. Intrigu-
ingly, L. braziliensis and its sister-species L. guyanensis
are associated with a persistent double-stranded RNA
virus named Leishmaniavirus 1, a member of the family
Totiviridae. The Leishmania parasite and the Leishma-
nia virus form a tripartite symbiosis together with the
mammalian host or the sandy vector. In our project,
we hypothesise that a joint inference of virus and par-
asite evolutionary histories will reveal unparalleled in-sights into the specic climatic, spatial and environ-
mental factors that drive the distribution of cutaneous
leishmaniasis in South-America.

LundU Sweden AnaerobicProtists
Dear colleagues,
The Stairs lab (Lund University, Sweden) is looking
for a highly-motivated PhD candidate to investigate
syntrophic interactions in anaerobic protists. Details
of the position and how to apply can be found below.
Thank you for sharing this with any suitable candidates
or within your local networks.
All details can be found: https://lu.varbi.com/-
what:job/jobID:382225/ Brief introduction to the posi-
tion: 'Doctoral student in Microbial Evolution'
Every ecosystem on our planet is composed of a complex
community of organisms. The function of these ecosys-
tems is often dependent on interactions 'V or symbioses
'V between community members. In the microbial world,
symbiotic interactions based on syntrophy (i.e., a type
of mutualistic symbiosis where nutrients are exchanged
between organisms to allow for metabolic division oflabour) are common, especially between prokaryotic
organisms in anoxic environments. Such interactions
are essential drivers of biogeochemical processes like
global carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycling. Whether
similar roles can be attributed to single-cell eukaryotes
(protists) occupying low-oxygen environments remains
unclear owing in large part to our limited understanding
of the biology, syntrophic potential, and metabolism of
anaerobic eukaryotes.
Work duties
The candidate will lead a project aimed at exploring
the metabolic and syntrophic potential of eukaryotic
life in low-oxygen environments using bioinformatic and
experimental methods. The candidate will use analyt-
ical and genomic techniques to investigate the nature,
stability and versatility of protist:prokaryote interac-
tions in vitro. We will also use cultivation-independent
single-cell methods to isolate individual protist cells and
their associated microbial consortia from local freshwa-
ter environments. Symbiotic potential of the protists
and their resident microbiome will be predicted using
state-of-the-art single-cell genomic and transcriptomic
methods.
The prospective doctoral candidate will join the Molecu-
lar Cell Biology Unit in the Biology Department at Lund
University under the supervision of Dr. Courtney Stairs
who has a background in eukaryotic microbiology and
Prof. Karin Rengefors a leading researcher in aquatic
ecology. The project will develop both ' ^A Â¥wet'^A and

AdaptationGenomics
PhD fellowship - The genomic basis of temperature
adaptation across space
A 3-year PhD fellowship is available at the Faculty of
Biosciences and Aquaculture, Nord University (Bod,
Norway) from June 2021. Application deadline: 17
March 2021.
We are oering a PhD position to study the genomic
basis of temperature adaptation in the marine snail Lit-
torina saxatilis. Understanding how organisms adapt
to their environment at the genomic level is a major
goal in evolutionary biology; research on adaptation
to local climatic conditions obtains great urgency in
times of anthropogenic climate change. L. saxatilis is an
emerging model system in evolutionary genomics and
very suitable for studying temperature adaptation as it
inhabits a large range of climatic environments, which
often vary on small spatial scales. The PhD position will
be part of an international project focusing on how tem-
perature adaptation changes across space, e.g. whether
the same traits and loci contribute to adaptation to
warm temperatures in dierent geographical locations.
Towards this goal, snail sampling across Europe will be
combined with experimental and genomic approaches.
The PhD project will aim to: 1. Reveal the genetic basis
of temperature adaptation in dierent locations using
temperature experiments followed by QTL mapping. 2.
Identify genes associated with temperature adaptation
using gene expression analysis.
The project will include some eld work and the design22 EvolDir March 1, 2021
and performance of physiological experiments, but the
largest part of the work will consist of the analysis of
genomic datasets. The PhD student will be part of an
international research team and, among other things, ac-
quire skills in eldwork, experimental design, molecular
lab work, bioinformatics, and statistical data analysis.
The PhD student is expected to spend several months
at the Tj arn o Marine Laboratory in Sweden to conduct
experiments.
Qualication requirements: The candidate must have
obtained an MSc (or equivalent) in evolutionary
biology, computational biology, biology or similar,
with a grade average of B or better (or equivalent)
both for the program in total and for the master's
thesis. Enthusiasm about evolutionary research, high
motivation to learn new skills and some experience
with coding and / or genomic data analysis are crucial
requirements. Ideally the candidate will have some
experience in one or more of the following areas:
Biological eld work, experimental work, QTL mapping,
RNAseq / gene expression analysis. Prociency in oral
and written English is essential and knowledge of a
Scandinavian language is benecial for the position.
The successful candidate will join the PhD program in
Aquatic Biosciences at Nord University and is expected
to complete the study within the three-year project
period. The candidate should fulll the admission
requirements and participate in the training component
stipulated in the regulations of the PhD program.
Application for admission to the program must be
submitted within three months after taking up the
position. For admission requirements and regulations,

position is based at the Institute of Ecology and Evo-
lution at the University of Bern, Switzerland, is fully
funded for 4 years including student fees and a generous
stipend, and is open to applicants worldwide.
Recombination is a fundamental genetic process. It con-
tributes to generating the genetic diversity upon which
natural selection acts and mechanistically it ensures
proper formation of sperm and egg cells. Studies of ne-
scale distribution of recombination along chromosomes,
and how this is regulated, have so far been possible
only in a limited number of species. This is now chang-
ing. In this project, we are going to construct ne-scaleMarch 1, 2021 EvolDir 25
recombination maps for over 30 species to (i) explore
links between recombination and genetic dierentiation
in pairs of populations or closely related species; and
(ii) to follow up on preliminary results suggesting the
mechanisms for specifying recombination hot-spots in
a large group of shes (Percomorpha) may be distinct
from other vertebrates.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with
a strong interest in evolutionary biology, genetics, ge-
nomics, and bioinformatics. Candidates should hold a
Master' ^As degree, demonstrate scientic curiosity, ini-
tiative, problem-solving skills, and be able to condently
communicate in English. On the technical side, de-
nite advantages include strong numeracy, understanding
of statistics and probability, and previous experience
with computer scripts/coding. We are committed to
increasing diversity, equity and inclusiveness in evolu-
tionary biology and would like to especially encourage
applications from underrepresented groups.
Milan is a young new PI, oering close focus on the
project and supervision of the PhD candidate, while the
project benets from access to large unique genomic
datasets and a world-class network of collaborators, in-
cluding Ole Seehausen (formal co-supervisor) and Katie
Peichel in Bern; Richard Durbin in Cambridge, UK;
Walter Salzburger in Basel, Switzerland; and Molly
Przeworski at the Columbia University in New York.
There is the potential for the PhD candidate to spend
up to eight months visiting at the Prof. Przeworski' ^As
lab in New York within the framework of this collabora-
tion. Bern itself is within a short distance of some of
the most iconic peaks of the Swiss Alps.
Applications should include a motivation letter, a CV,
and contact details for at least two referees and should
be sent, ideally as a single PDF document, to Milan
Malinsky (millanek@gmail.com). The start date for the
PhD is between 1st April 2021 and 30th September 2021,
to be agreed with the successful applicant. Screening of

Autumn 2021!
We seek an enthusiastic student interested in pursu-
ing a PhD in the EvoGen lab (principal investiga-
tor, Toni Gossmann) at Bielefeld University (https://-
tgossmann.github.io/). Our lab focuses on approaches
and data analysis to identify imprints of selection in nat-
ural populations, making use of newly available biodiver-
sity data produced through next generation sequencing
approaches.
Project
What genomic regions are involved in the processes of
species dierentiation and hybrid formation? While
these are central problems in evolutionary ecology, little
is known about the role of epigenetics underlying species
dierentiation and hybrid formation in animals. The
aim of the project is to address this fundamental knowl-
edge gap by investigating the role of DNA Methylation
in avian hybrids and across the species spectrum, using
the great tit (Parus major) species complex as a model.
This study will combine computational approaches (e.g.|
simulations, bioinformatics) as well as novel sequencing
approaches and their data analysis+interpretation.
Ideal start date for this PhD position is winter semester
2021, though the exact start date is negotiable. The
position is open to National and International students
(EU and worldwide) and funded for 3.5 years (TV-L
E13, 65%) by the European Union as part of the ERC
starting grant \DECAF".
We are seeking a student with a background and in-
terests in any of the following: - evolution - ecological
bioinformatics - next generation sequencing - biodiver-
sity -(avian) genomics - speciation and hybridisation
Some exposure to statistics and programming is ex-
pected, though mastery of these tools is not required
and there will be ample opportunity to continue to
build and rene your skills through mentorship and col-
laboration in our lab. Wet-lab experience (e.g.|DNA26 EvolDir March 1, 2021
extraction from tissues) is a plus.
How to apply
Interested students are encouraged to send the follow-
ing materials: -Cover letter discussing their interest in
joining the lab -CV -Copies of undergraduate and (if

Down to earth, pleasantly normal and laid back: a
good description of many of the city's residents and
of Bielefeld itself. With a population of over 330,000
(and constantly on the rise), Bielefeld is one of the 20
largest cities in Germany. Its residents particularly ap-
preciate the high quality of life, the advantages of a
strong economic location and the range of educational
and scientic facilities. More than one billion euros has
been invested by the State of North Rhine-Westphalia
into Campus Bielefeld, shared between Bielefeld Uni-
versity and the University of Applied Sciences. This
has resulted in one of the most modern facilities for
education and research in Germany. Few cities are as
green as Bielefeld, thanks to its location amid the Teuto-

UBradford HumanMicrobiome
*Adaptation and community dynamics of the human
oral microbiome over centuries of evolution*
A funded PhD studentship is available at the University
of Bradford, UK, with Dr Conor Meehan and Dr An-
drew Tedder, in collaboration with Dr Camila Speller
at UBC.
The human microbiome is composed of two categories
of microbes: commensals (benecial to the host) and
pathogens (detrimental to host health). While we know
quite a lot about modern microbiomes in terms of what
bacteria live there, how they enter the body and howthe specic body site select for certain bacteria, little
is known about the historical evolution of the human
microbiome. How have commensals and pathogens in-
teracted over the past thousand years in and on our
bodies? What bacteria rely on what other bacteria for
survival and has this changed over time?
Understanding three core aspects of the human micro-
biome (evolution, adaptation and interconnectedness)
would better allow us to examine the eect of diet and
human health on our resident microbes and in turn un-
derstand how shaping the microbial community in our
bodies could better benet our health.
This project aims to address these questions, focussing
on the human oral cavity microbiome. Using dental
calculus microbiome whole genome data collected over
5000 years from Yorkshire archaeological skeletons, we
will reconstruct the evolution of the human oral micro-
biome in Northern England and examine the inuence of
diet, antibiotic exposure and urbanisation on this com-
munity. Next, by combining this dataset with modern
global samples, we can extensively explore the human
oral microbiome community ecology, including genetic
exchange and metabolic handovers. This will allow us to
investigate whether modern microbiomes interact and
respond to change better than historical counterparts.
This type of historical and wide-ranging investigation
of the community dynamics of the oral microbiome has
never been performed and will extensively advance our
understanding of this crucial aspect of human health
with high relevance to the local Bradford community.
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate, prefer-
ably with a background in some (but not necessarily
all) of the following topics: bioinformatics, molecular
evolution, microbial ecology, phylogenetics

Project title: Research synthesis and meta-research on
the impacts of PFAS environmental pollutants on hu-
man and wildlife health
Background: Peruoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are man-
made chemicals that are fund in our environments, pos-
ing health risk to wildlife and human populations. They
were subject to numerous empirical studies and also
secondary studies (i.e. systematic reviews and meta-
analyses). The project endeavors to synthesize both
primary and secondary literature on PFAS impacts on
human and animal health. Further, this project will
evaluate the evidence quality and research practices
through the lens of meta-science.

Project title: Developing new statistical methods for
meta-analysis for ecological and environmental applica-
tions and beyond
Background: Meta-analysis is a powerful way of quanti-
tatively summarizing empirical evidence in many dier-
ent elds encompassing medical, social and biological
sciences. However, there are a number of areas which
require further developments. In particular, this project
will develop three areas: 1) meta-analysis of variation
(e.g., using the ratio of SD or CV between two groups),
2) meta-analysis of interaction (e.g., synthesizing 2 x 2
factorial design), and 3) arm-based meta-analytic mod-
els (vs. traditional comparison-basedmodels).32 EvolDir March 1, 2021
The candidate will develop dierent meta-analytic mod-
els and their implementations. Further, they will use
simulation studies tovalidate and compare dierent
meta-analytic models. These simulation studies will
be often done in the context of ecological, evolutionary,
conservation and environmental research, but all of the
methods that will be developed through this project
will have applications beyond these elds. Also, the
candidate will be encouraged to develop their ideas after
the initial stage of their PhD project.
Candidate: BSc(Hons) or MSc in statistical or comput-
ersciences preferred, but applicants with other degrees
with strong quantitative skills will be considered.

Project description: Our group uses a combination of
long-term ecological monitoring and genomic approaches
in pied and collared ycatchers from a hybrid zone lo-
cated on the Swedish island ~Aland to better understand
mechanisms of speciation. Divergent climate adaptation
is a likely evolutionary route to postzygotic isolation, but
evidence showing that climate-driven genetic divergence
may lead to hybrid incompatibilities is lacking. In eu-
karyotic organisms, climate adaptation largely depends
on co-evolving mitochondrial and nuclear (mitonuclear)
DNA, which together encode the proteins needed to
build the biochemical machinery responsible for energy
metabolism. The two exciting main goals of this PhD
project are to identify specic allelic changes within the
networks of mitonuclear units underlying both (1) di-
vergent climate adaptation, and (2) hybrid dysfunction.
To achieve these goals detailed ecological studies and
eld experiments will be integrated with new techniques
to measure cellular mitochondrial function directly in
the eld, and with several state-of the art genomic ap-
proaches.
Duties: The successful candidate will conduct eld sam-
pling (including both population monitoring and eld
experiments), measure mitochondrial function in blood
samples and perform genomic analysis. The PhD stu-
dent will work together with a cross-disciplinary super-
visor team, have the opportunity to actively shape the
detailed development of the project and to drive the
writing and publication of the results. Attendance to
local seminaries series, advanced relevant courses and
international conferences is also expected.
Requirements: To be eligible for this position the ap-
plicant must hold a master degree (or equivalent) in
ecology, evolution or in closely related disciplines. Can-
didates must also be able to express themselves uently
in spoken as well as written English. In ranking eligible
candidates, special importance will be given to scientic
skills. In the assessment of scientic merits, especially34 EvolDir March 1, 2021
analytic skills and the ability to formulate sharp hy-
pothesis and logic arguments will be highly valued. We
attach great importance to personal qualities such as
that the candidate is highly motivated and with a strong
general interest in ecology and evolution.
Additional qualications: Previous experiences with
eld ornithology and/or bioinformatics are desired but
not required. Previous experiences with practical re-
search projects and statistical/mathematical modelling
are highly desired.
Type of employment: Temporary position according to
the Higher Education Ordinance chapter 5  c 7. The grad-
uate program covers four years of full-time study. The
position can be combined with teaching or other duties
at the department (maximum 20%), which prolongs the

UppsalaU MutationRateEvolution
PhD position in Evolutionary Genetics at Uppsala Uni-
versity
The PhD-position is placed in the research group of
Hanna Johannesson, within the Department of Or-
ganismal Biology. The group uses a combination of
theoretical, genomic and experimental approaches to
study eukaryote genome evolution. We use dierent
fungal model system to challenge general evolutionary
paradigms. The group is international and English
is the working language. See Johannesson's web-page
for more information on the research and recent pub-lications (https://www.iob.uu.se/research/systematic-
biology/johannesson/publications/).
The PhD project aims to elucidate the determinants of
mutation rates in eukaryotes, using lamentous fungi
of the order Sordariales as study systems. Mutation
is the ultimate source of genetic variation among and
within species, and hence, the mutation type, rate and
tness eect are critical parameters for understanding
adaptation and species diversication. At the same time,
mutations have important medical implications, being
a critical factor for, e.g., ageing and the dynamics of
cancer cell development. An organism's combination of
basic biological traits, such as cell fate and longevity,
is predicted to determine the ability of mutations to
accumulate and transmit over generations, but the mu-
tational processes and factors driving their variation are
still poorly understood. A multitude of genomic and
ecological information is available from the Sordariales,
and can be used as a platform to start the PhD-project.
The project will be planned and developed after the
interest of the candidate, and may include experimental,
bioinformatic, phylogenetic and/or population genetic
approaches.
Requirements: Completed university education of 240
university points (h ogskolepo ang, hp) out of which 60
hp on advanced level corresponding to master degree in
relevant eld. The ideal candidate is highly motivated
with thorough education and strong interest in evolution-
ary genetics/genomics, phylogenetics and/or population
genetics. Good knowledge of English in speech and writ-
ing. Great emphasis is placed on personal qualities such
as planning and organizational skills, accountability and
accuracy.
Position: The PhD-student position is a 4-year appoint-
ment, and the candidate will primarily devote the time
to his/her own research studies. Other departmental
work, such as teaching or administration can be part
of the position (maximum 20 %). Salary placement is

PhD position in population genetics and molecular epi-
demiology of plant pathogens
I am seeking a PhD student to join my SNSF-funded re-
search project at the Department of Plant and Microbial
Biology, University of Zurich.
Project Description
Agricultural pathogens cause substantial crop losses
each year. To control pathogens, modern agriculture
relies on pesticide treatments and breeding of resistant
crop varieties. However, pesticides are harmful to the
environment and to human health, and pathogen popu-
lations can quickly develop resistance to pesticides and
gain virulence on previously resistant varieties. Under-
standing the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics
of pathogen populations is crucial to develop sustainable
control strategies. The successful candidate will investi-
gate the population genetics, evolutionary history, and
epidemiology of a fungal pathogen of wheat (Blumeria
graminis) in Europe, using whole genome sequence data.
The main project will involve eld work (sampling of
wheat powdery mildew, ~15% of workload), lab work
(maintenance of B. graminis isolates in the lab, and
generation of whole genome sequence data, ~15% of
workload), and data analysis (bioinformatics, ~70% of
workload). Your prole
The ideal candidate will have completed an MSc degree
in Population Genetics, Evolutionary Biology, Bioin-
formatics, or a related eld. Experience in molecular
biology techniques, programming in R, Perl or python,
and analysis of next generation sequence data are a plus
but not mandatory. Good English skills (speaking and
writing) are expected.
How to apply
The start date for this position is September 2021, al-36 EvolDir March 1, 2021
though a later date could be negotiated. Applicants are
encouraged to apply as soon as possible. The review of
applications will begin in March 2021, and the position
remains open until lled. The position is based at the
Botanical garden in Zurich. The successful candidate
will join my newly established research group at the
Department of Plant and Microbial Biology (UZH), and
will be enrolled in the PhD program in Evolutionary
Biology of the University of Zurich. To apply, submit aCV, a short statement of interest (max 1 page) detailing
previous research experience and relevant skills, and the
names and contact information of two academic refer-
ences as a single pdf to fabrizio.menardo@swisstph.ch.

Field assistant position to work on collared ycatcher
population on Gotland
at the Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian
University (Poland)
What do we study: It is well established that biolog-
ical rhythms are fundamental drivers of biochemistry,
cell biology, physiology and behaviour. The regularity
of behaviours is governed by endogenous clocks, which
are adjusted and synchronised with environmental cues,
primarily light. Rapidly expanding anthropopressure
largely disrupts these cues. Yet, it is surprising how little
we know about the eects of disorders in the function-
ing of the internal time-keepers in free-ranging animals.
The project will aim at understanding the eects of
disturbance in environmental cues, i.e. light exposure,
on circadian clock of a wild migratory bird: collared
ycatcher (Ficedula albicollis).March 1, 2021 EvolDir 43

a PhD scholarship for motivated eld assistants (after
meeting criteria of admission to the Doctoral school of

(preferably with birds) is considered advantageous; bird
ringing/handling experience, bird ringing and ethical
permits to work with animals are a plus.
Salary: 3000 PLN total (before tax), ticket to/from

spe-2 The Centre of Biology for the Management
of Populations (CBGP) conducts research on the
taxonomy, molecular systematics, phylogenomics
and macro-evolutionary studies of insect groups of
agricultural importance (pests and biocontrol agents).
You will be part of the research department \Charac-
terisation and Evolution of Biodiversity". Research
projects in the department focus on the description
of biodiversity (e.g. species delimitation ), as well
as on the study of its dynamics in the face of global
changes. We conduct macroevolutionnary studies on the
evolution of life-history traits and the diversication of
various arthropod lineages as well as ecological studies
such as the modelling of ecological niches and|the
investigation of interaction networks in agricultural
ecosystems. .
In collaboration with the scientists of the department,
you will develop research on the systematics and evolu-
tionary biology of insect groups of agricultural relevance
(pests and/or biocontrol agents) using integrative ap-
proaches combining morphological, biological, ecological
and molecular data (in particular high-throughput se-
quencing data). The joint analysis of these data will
allow the reconstruction of phylogenies at dierent taxo-
nomic levels - from species complexes to (supra)-family
level - in order to (i) identify species boundaries and
revise taxonomic classications; (ii) infer the history
of traits involved in the adaptation of insects to their
environment (for example the host range of herbivo-rous insects or parasitoids, their climatic niche, their
life cycle). Your research project should provide a bet-
ter understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of the
group(s) studied such as the dynamics of host shifts
(or other life-history traits) to help predict evolution-
ary trajectories associated with the ability to switch to
new hosts or to colonize new environments, the invasive
potential or the extinction risk.
In your research, you will be able to draw on the exper-
tise of scientists in your department, on a very active
community in evolutionary biology in Montpellier, on
the rst European collection of arthropods of agricul-
tural importance.
Training and skills
Candidates must have a PhD or equivalent.
Experience in taxonomy of terrestrial arthropods, prefer-
ably on a group of insects of agricultural importance is
recommended. Knowledge of the concepts and methods
associated with the analysis of molecular data (par-
ticularly high-throughput sequencing data) for phylo-
genetic inference is recommended. Knowledge of the
analytical tools that use phylogenetic data to study the
evolution of the ecological niche of the group studied
would be appreciated. Contact If you do you want

SexualSelection
SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCE FOR UNDER-
GRADUATES ON SEXUAL SELECTION IN IN-
SECTS: This REU is funded by the National Science
Foundation and provides a 10-week paid research oppor-
tunity for students to engage in evolutionary ecology
research with insects in California.
WHEN: 11 June 2021 to 20 August 2021
RESEARCH TOPIC: Reproductive trade-os between
costly sexually selected weapons and other expensive tis-
sues in three species of Coreoidea (Insecta: Hemiptera)
In many species, males engage in competitive behaviors
with weapons for access to high-quality territories and
mates. However, weapons may be costly to develop and
maintain and likely compete with other traits for lim-
ited resources. Furthermore, when females mate with
multiple males, investing resources in weapons may not
signicantly increase reproductive success. In such cases,
males may invest more resources in reproductive tissues,
such as testes size, to compete with sperm from other
males in the female reproductive tract. Leaf-footed bugs
(Hemiptera: Coreoidea) have become a model in study-
ing trade-os between weapons and testes. Males in
several species use their hind legs as weapons, which
they can naturally self-amputate (autotomy) when they
are injured or to escape predators or a bad molt. If a
male were to lose a weapon, would he be able to reallo-
cate resources towards increased testes growth? Would
the loss of a hind leg also trade-o with other expensive
tissues, like ight muscles? What happens in speciesthat have hind legs that are not used as weapons? This
study seeks to answer these questions in three species of
leaf-footed bugs, which is part of a larger comparative
study analyzing trade-os between weapons and testes
across the family.
QUALIFICATIONS & RESPONSIBILITIES. We are
seeking three undergraduate students that are commit-
ted, reliable, independent, and team-oriented with a
positive attitude and great work ethic to conduct this
study. Some previous research experience and course-
work in biology are preferred, but no formal experience
with insects or insect science is required. Only US
citizens and permanent residents enrolled in an under-
graduate degree program and that will not graduate
prior to the completion of the REU will be considered.
Students must: 1) be comfortable handling live and
dead insects, 2) be able to conduct eldwork in very
hot and dry conditions, 3) be extremely detail-oriented,
4) take initiative in learning the study organism and
research project, 5) understand what needs to be done
and complete tasks with maximal eort, 6) be able to
perform frequent computer-based work and eldwork,
7) exhibit exceptional note-taking and organizational
skills, and 8) be independent once trained. Students will
be trained in eldwork, insect husbandry, rearing, auto-
tomy, imaging, dissections, and measurements. Students
will also be required to dedicate part of their weekly re-
search hours to one-hour lab meetings per week, attend
weekly virtual science seminars at aliated institutions,
and present a summary of project ndings or primary
scientic literature towards the end of the REU.
RESEARCH TEAM. Drs. Michael Forthman and Chris-
tine W. Miller are committed to excellence in the men-
toring of undergraduate researchers. We have collec-
tively mentored over 150 undergraduates in the past
twelve years. Undergraduate students have authored
peer-reviewed publications, presented at local and na-
tional meetings, and won local and national awards. The
successful applicants will work with the research team
throughout the REU. Please visit www.millerlab.net
and mforthman.weebly.com for more information on the
research team.
APPLICATION DEADLINE IS MARCH 15, 2021. In-
terested applicants should submit a CV or resume, unof-
cial transcripts, contact information for two references,
and a 500-word (or less) statement of interest to Dr.
Michael Forthman (michael.forthman@cdfa.ca.gov). It
is advised that these documents are submitted as a
single PDF.
COVID-19 AND TRAVEL DISCLAIMER. Due to the
continued threat of COVID-19 and evolving safety guid-
ance, this REU required a change in project location64 EvolDir March 1, 2021
and budget. As a result of this, airfare for students
to travel to/from California from outside the state will
not be covered under REU grant funds. However, a
competitive stipend is available per student, and local,
project-related travel within California will be covered
by the REU grant funds. Furthermore, local, state,
and federal COVID-19 guidance will be followed, and
successful applicants traveling from outside California
may be required or asked to quarantine in California
approximately 10 to 14 days (subject to change based
on future safety guidance) prior to the start of the REU
project.

**ESEB Outreach Initiative Fund**
The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB)
welcomes applications to the ESEB Outreach Initiative
Fund for projects that promote evolution-related activ-
ities. The goal of this initiative is to improve public
knowledge about evolution globally.
Applications for funding will be accepted for educational
initiatives that promote evolution, translation of evolu-
tionary material (books, lms, and websites) intended
for a general audience, public outreach seminars, public
exhibitions, etc.
There will be a single call per year with a total budget
of 20,000 Euro. A single project can be funded with up
to 4,000 Euro, but smaller projects are welcome. We
are requesting a report after one year, at which time
the project should be completed.
Please use the ESEB application form to submit your
proposal and note the word limits given herein. The
form can be downloaded at the ESEB website: https:/-
/eseb.org/prizes-funding/outreach-fund/ Proposals will
be accepted until *15th March 2021* and should besubmitted by email to the ESEB oce (Email: of-
ce@eseb.org; Subject: Outreach 2021). Note that we
will acknowledge receipt of all applications within a
week. If you have not received our conrmation by then,
please contact the ESEB oce again!
Please note that scientic meetings are not supported
by ESEB Outreach Initiative funds. These fund also do
not work as a mechanism for continual funding. Once
the potential of a project has been demonstrated, this
should be used as a basis to convince other funding
sources on continuation funds. Hence, submissions by a
group that has been successful in past calls may be pe-
nalized if the proposals are mere follow-ups of previous
projects.
The applications will be evaluated by the Outreach
Initiative Committee:

WildBirds
We are looking for motivated expenses-paid eld assis-
tants to join our team for another eld seasons in the
wild blue tit & collared ycatcher population on the
island of Gotland (Sweden) for the coming spring. The
Gotland population has been studied for over 40 years
and is one of the longest running wild bird population
study in the world.
What we oer? You will join the team of several re-
searchers from Poland and Sweden and contribute to the
day-to-day tasks and procedures during the eldwork
on the island. We oer covering all eldwork-related
expenses (reasonable travel expenses; accommodation
- in a big nice house close to the study plots in rooms
shared with one or max 2 assistants; per-diems to cover
food expenses) and participation in an exciting project
in a beautiful and isolated place. Gotland is a perfect
birdwatching spot, oering lots of after-work birding
opportunities. It also is home to one of Sweden's most
proling bird ringing stations. The house we use asour base is equipped with a kitchen, all amenities, fast
internet connection, laundry and a big garden.
Who do we look for? Ideally you should have prior
experience with eldwork, best if involving wild birds.
The eldwork on Gotland involves, among other things,
catching adult birds using mist-nets and nest-traps, ring-
ing adults and nestlings, basic morphological measure-
ments, blood-sampling using well-established protocol
widely used in ecological studies. You should be pre-
pared to work several hours a day, with long-hours work
during peaks of the breeding seasons (when chicks hatch
and when adults are being caught). Gotland is usually
quite gentle in terms of weather, with many sunny days
- but variable weather should also be expected. Prefer-
ably, you should have a driving licence - the study areas
are spread over the distance of about 10-15 km, and we
usually visit them using rented cars (or in case of closer
plots using bikes).
Current projects involve two species (blue tits and col-
lared ycatchers) with a separate team from France
working on great tits. The birds nest in wooden nest-
boxes that are easily accessible (no need to carry a
ladder).
Timing: the eldwork starts around the 20th of April,
and this is the starting date of our oered positions. We
can also accept later arrivals, but earlier ones will be
prioritised. The eldwork usually runs until last weeks
of June.
COVID measures: the situation in Europe is unpre-
dictable and so the circumstances may change on a
day-by-day basis. The current situation is that we are
condent the eld season will start as planned, but we
cannot promise anything should the situation in Europe
and/or in Sweden change. Currently, it is likely that
you will have to test yourself for COVID19 before en-
tering Sweden - probably just before departure from
your home location. When applying, please take into
account any restrictions your location may have in terms
of travelling to the European Union. The rework site
itself is COVID-safe, it is an isolated small village with
little/no touristic activity in early spring.
If you are interested in joining us please contact Dr
Szymon Drobniak (szymek.drobniak@gmail.com) with
your brief CV outlining your previous experience and
education. Also, please include a name and contact
details of one referee. The call will remain open until we
have lled all positions (which will likely happen before
the end of March, to leave plenty of time for university
formalities). Please contact us at the same address if
you have any questions.

the Systematics Association (http://www.systass.org/)
jointly administer the Linn eSys: Systematics Research
Fund that provides grants annually for small-scale re-
search projects in the eld of systematics.
The Systematics Research Fund has been renamed to
the Linn eSys: Systematics Research Fund.
Typical activities supported include contributions to
eldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientic equip-
ment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical equip-
ment), specimen preparation (including the cost of tem-
porary technical assistance), and contributions to publi-
cation costs. However, please note that it is unable to
fund the cost of article publication charges. Projects of
a more general or educational nature will also be con-
sidered, provided that they include a strong systematics
component. Typical activities not supported include
attendance at scientic meetings and contributions to
student maintenance or tuition fees. The fund does
not provide payments for Bench Fees. Projects already
substantially funded by other bodies may be disadvan-
taged. Applications of all nationalities are welcome, but
applicants must be a current member of the Systematics
Association or Linnean Society of London.
Successful projects are selected by a panel of systema-
tists who represent a wide range of conceptual interests
and taxonomic groups. Generally, applications in the
range of 500-1000 are preferred, the value of any single
award will not exceed 1500.

Fieldwork volunteers wanted: Help us study plant evo-
lution in the Spanish Pyrenees!
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and Tech-
nology (IST) Austria https://ist.ac.at/en/research/-
barton-group/ is looking for volunteers to assist with
eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees (Spain)
this coming summer (late May - early August). This
is a great opportunity for anybody looking to obtain
experience in eld work relating to evolutionary biology,
speciation, plant ecology and plant-animal interactions.
The project: We study evolutionary dynamics and speci-
ation in snapdragons. The study'Xwhich has been run-
ning since 2011'Xinvolves eld work on natural hybrid
zones between two subspecies with dierent coloured
owers. The goal is to understand how dierent evolu-
tionary forces'Xlike natural selection'Xhave shaped this
diversity.
The eldwork: We are seeking volunteers to assist with
the eld work, which involves working in teams to mapthe location of individual plants (GPS), tag and sample
them for leaves and owers, measuring traits, and pro-
cessing material for later DNA extraction. There may
also be opportunities to be involved in other projects
focusing on pollinator behaviour and plant-insect in-
teractions. Most of the work is outdoors, but we do
spend some time indoors processing samples. The work
is highly team orientated, typically in groups of 2-3 in
the eld and larger groups processing samples back at
the research station.
The location: is near Ripoll in a beautiful part of the
Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia). We stay
in comfortable apartments overlooking a picturesque
valley, with close access to hiking trails and small vil-
lages.
The ideal applicant: is an enthusiastic, hardworking bi-
ology student with strong interest in working outdoors.
You must be meticulous with recording data and also
be comfortable working as part of a team. Experience
with eld-based projects and plants is helpful but not
essential. Climbing experience is useful as some work
is conducted on ropes. We are looking for volunteers
between the 29th May and the 1st of August. The
length of stay is exible but we ask people to commit
to a minimum 3 week stay. Applicants must be located
in the Europe or the UK.
What we cover: All food, lodgings and any travel within
Europe/UK are covered.
How to apply? By the closing date of April 10th, please
send (i) your CV, (ii) a short explanation about why
you are interested, and (iii) your availability between
the above dates to eldvolunteer2021@gmail.com
Please send any questions to the same address.
*A note about Covid19 Although we are planning the
eld season optimistically, the Covid19 pandemic may
force use to change/cancel our plans at very short notice.
We will give as much notice as possible regarding any
changes. Assuming the eld season proceeds normally,
all and volunteers will be required to present a negative
Covid test prior to their arrival in the eld.

Genomics-based Population Demographic Histories for
Megafauna
Fully-funded open 2-yr postdoc position for an excit-
ing project on population histories of large-bodied at
Aarhus University supervised by Jens-Christian Sven-
ning and Mikkel Heide Schierup. To apply before April
1, 2021, please visit https://bit.ly/megageno2 Detailed
description:
The Department of Biology, Aarhus University, invites
applications for a 2-year bioinformatics postdoc posi-
tion to help overcome key knowledge gaps about past
megafauna population dynamics, their drivers, and,
linked to this, uncertainties about restoration targets.
We are oering applicants an exciting opportunity to
join Center for Biodiversity Dynamics in a Changing
World (BIOCHANGE). BIOCHANGE aims to address
one of the key challenges facing humanity 'V how to
conserve the diversity of life on a planet heading to-
wards 11 billion inhabitants and facing strong climate
change in order to safeguard our natural and cultural
heritage, quality of life, the numerous ecosystem ser-
vices on which society depends, and even the basic
functioning of the biosphere. Ecological science is key
to overcoming this challenge, and BIOCHANGE works
towards this goal via basic research on fundamental An-
thropocene ecological dynamics, climate change impact
predictions, scenarios, and mitigation options, Big Data
ecological approaches, and interdisciplinary perspectives
on human-nature relations and solutions.
Starting Date and Period The position is for 2 years
and is available from August 1, 2021.
Job description Large-bodied mammal species
(megafauna) are ecologically important, but have
decline worldwide across the last 50,000 years or
more under pressure from hunting, habitat loss etc.,
with these declines still ongoing in many regions. In
consequence, megafauna species have special attention
in nature conservation and ecosystem restoration. At
the same time, there are many unanswered questions
about past megafauna population dynamics, their
drivers (notably climate vs. human impact), and,
linked to this, uncertainties about restoration targets.
This postdoc project will address this key knowledge
gap through reconstructing population demographic
histories for a large number of mammal speciesworldwide, contrasting megafauna and smaller species.
Whole genome sequence data is publicly available as
raw data for numerous megafauna species, often from
multiple individuals. Such data contain a rich source
of information on past demographic changes that can
be extracted using population genetics approaches.
This bioinformatics project will be based on existing
data, and key elements in the work will be to locate
and curate the data available such that it can be
aggregated in a homogenized database for subsequent
population demographic reconstructions to be coupled
with relevant ecological modelling. The postdoc is
expected to contribute ideas and concepts to the
project and lead the development of at least two
high-quality papers based on the project, contribute to
the project' ^As public outreach and teaching, as well
as collaborate with other team members, including
students, sharing skills, and helping solve problems in
her/his area of expertise.
Your prole Applicants must have PhD degree in bioin-
formatics, population genetics or quantitative biology
(or equivalent), or have submitted their PhD thesis for
assessment before the application deadline. Expertise
in large-scale bioinformatics analyses is required and
familiarity with population genetics principles for infer-
ence on population demographics is a great advantage.
Experience with ecological niche modelling and interest
in megafauna, ecology, and conservation are also an
advantage. The successful candidate is expected to have
strong collaborative skills, proven abilities to publish
at a high international level, and have good skills in
English and international applicants who do not have
English as their rst language must prove strong English
language writing skills and uency.
Who we are Project PI prof. Jens-Christian Sven-
ning will be the main supervisor. The postdoc will
join Svenning' ^As VILLUM Investigator team within
the Center for Biodiversity Dynamics in a Changing
World (BIOCHANGE) and the Section for Ecoinformat-
ics & Biodiversity (ECOINF). BIOCHANGE is a center
of excellence focused on improving our understanding,
predictive capacity, and responses to the ongoing and
future dynamics in biodiversity under global change.
ECOINF harbors strong expertise in macroecology, re-
mote sensing, and megafauna and vegetation ecology,
as well as in ecology and biodiversity broadly. Together
BIOCHANGE and ECOINF constitute an ambitious,
collaborative and highly international research commu-
nity. Postdocs and PhD students are encouraged to
collaborate within the group, across departments and
with other universities. More

ETH Zurich DirectedEvolution
Postdoctoral position in Directed Evolution
The recently formed group of Dr. Macarena Toll-Riera
(https://evomicrobio.ethz.ch) is seeking a Postdoctoral
researcher to study the evolvability of a cold-adapted
enzyme through the combination of experimental and
high-throughput sequencing approaches. We are hosted
at the Institute of Integrative Biology (ETH Zurich), in
the Professorship of Evolutionary Biology.
Project background
Many mutations that improve protein function are detri-
mental because aect protein stability. However, extra-
stable proteins can accumulate mutations that improve
protein function without compromising the stability
of the protein, suggesting that higher protein stability
could facilitate adaptation (Bloom et al., 2006).
Cold-adapted enzymes have unique structural character-
istics (i.e. lower protein stability and higher exibility)
that allow them to thrive in cold temperatures. In this
project we will investigate how these unique structural
characteristics aect their evolvability.
Job description
The candidate will use a directed evolution approach
to evolve a cold-adapted and a mesophilic ^ a-lactamase
towards resistance to antibiotics. She/he will couple
directed evolution experiments to sequencing to identify
the mutations that confer resistance to antibiotics. The
successful candidate will be encouraged to design and
undertake additional projects.
We oer three years of funding and to be part of a
small, but collaborative and dynamic group. We are
hosted at the Institute of Integrative Biology, ETH
Zurich. The candidate will benet from a vibrant and
interdisciplinary academic environment with excellent
opportunities for education, training and collaboration.
Aside from the high quality of life, Zurich provides easy
access to outdoor activities.78 EvolDir March 1, 2021
Your prole
The successful candidate should have a genuine interest
in evolutionary biology, a strong background in micro-
biological techniques and molecular cloning and have
a good command of English. Programming skills and
experience analysing next-generation sequencing data
are an asset.
The candidate should be highly motivated, enthusiastic,
curious and able to work independently but also as a

Pau France 2 MicrobialEvolution
Dear all,
We are recruiting two collaborators in Microbial Ecology
with expertise in Bioinformatics and/or Computational
Biology at the Universit e de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour.
The fellowships will have the duration of 12 months
with possibility of extension at the end of this period.
Topic:
Metallophores in microbial communities: distribution,
diversity, importance in microbial assemblages and
ecosystem functioning
Scientic context:
In a natural environment, at pH where most life exists,
microbial growth can be limited by the availability of
metals. This limitation in the environment can have
signicant consequences on ecosystem functioning. To
ensure their survival and their development, microor-
ganisms have developed strategies for the recovery and
absorption of metals from the surrounding environment.
The capture of metal is ensured by the synthesis of
siderophores (iron) or more generically metallophores.
The biosynthetic potential of metallophores does not
appear to be equally distributed among organisms, en-
vironments or microbial life cycles, but rather is en-
riched within a number of prolic clades. One eld
of investigation aims at seeking for new metallophore
biosynthetic genes to enlarge our view of their diversity
in the microbial world and investigate these data in an
eco-evolutionary perspective.
Scientic environment:
The post-doctoral fellows will work at the IPREM In-
stitute (https://iprem.univ-pau.fr/fr/index.html) under
the supervision of Pr. B. Lauga and Pr R. Duran, and in
collaboration with M. Medema ( bioinformatics group)
at the U. Wageningen.
The two post-doctoral fellows will form a team bring-ing all the bioinformatics expertise required for a ne
investigation of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic
data generated on eld collected, microcosm generated
samples and worldwide databases in order to i) establish
an inventory of metallophore biosynthetic gene clusters
(BGC), in microbial genomes and metagenomes from
diverse environments, ii) infer their role in microbial
assemblages by linking them to known metallophores
and natural products, iii) conduct meta-analysis on the
distribution of BGC across worldwide habitats in order
to highlight any specic distribution and reveal if hot
spots of genetic diversity exist for metallophore BGC.
Our ultimate goals are i) to better understand the
metabolic interactions occurring within complex multi-
species microbial assemblages, ii) to evaluate, at the
ecosystem level, how metallophores contribute to com-
munity assembly, functioning, and beyond, to ecosys-
tems functioning.
Situation:
The Universit e de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour campus
is located in the charming city of Pau in southwestern
France in a region bordering Spain. It benets from
exceptional resources due to its geographical location,
close to the Pyrenees (1h drive) and the Atlantic coast
(1h drive), with numerous air links from the airport and
trains to Paris.
The IPREM is a Joint Research Unit CNRS / UPPA
(UMR 5254) with 120 permanent sta and 140 PhD
and Post-docs.
Requirements:
We are seeking highly motivated postdoctoral research
scientists with expertise in the analysis of (meta )ge-
nomics/(meta )transcriptomics data to work at IPREM.
The ideal candidates should have a PhD in the elds
of Bioinformatics or Computational Biology and mi-
crobial ecology, with research experience in NGS data
analysis. A good background in microbial evolution and
biostatistics would be appreciated.
Application procedure:

Postdoc Position in Comparative Genomics
The Hiller Lab at the LOEWE Center for Translational
Biodiversity Genomics (TBG) in Frankfurt, Germany
is looking for an ambitious Postdoc to investigate the
genomic basis of phenotypic dierences between species.
Project: The project aims at linking phenotypic adap-
tations to genomic dierences, which is a central goal
in the genomics era. The postdoc is expected to capi-
talize on a powerful repertoire of genomic methods as
well as genome alignments and comparative data for
several hundred mammals and birds that the lab has
generated. A large list of interesting adaptations includ-
ing metabolic, physiological and morphological traits
in bats, dolphins, other mammals and vertebrates is
available to be studied, and choices can be inuenced
by the preference of the postdoc.
Our lab: The mission of our group is to understand how
nature's fascinating phenotypic diversity has evolved
and how it is encoded in the genome. Work in the
lab includes genome sequencing and assembly, genome
alignment and annotation, development and application
of comparative genomic methods to discover dierences
in genes and cis-regulatory elements, and the use of
statistical approaches to link phenotypic to genomic
changes [1-8].

informatics approaches. The project will examine how
sharing resistance gene alleles aects transmission of
soil microbial pathogens between neighboring tropical
tree seedlings and adults, and consequent eects on
seedling tness. Results will provide new insights about
the way genetic variation aects plant defense, plant-
microbe interactions, and heretofore mechanistically
unexplored processes such as plant-soil feedbacks and
negative density dependence that are increasingly the
focus of theoretical models of forest dynamics and the
maintenance of tree species diversity. The project is
situated in Panama at STRI, with annual visits planned
to the USDA-ARS Culture Collection and to Penn State
University to work with collaborators and for additional
professional development and training opportunities.

TrentU PDF PhD CaribouGenomics
Post-Doctoral and Graduate Student Opportunities in
Conservation Genomics
EcoGenomics is a national-scale collaborative research
program based in Canada and focused on caribou conser-
vation genomics. We are currently seeking post-doctoral
fellows and graduate students to participate in a large-
scale project funded by Genome Canada's Genomic
Applications Partnership Program and aiming at devel-
oping a national non-invasive monitoring approach for
caribou.
Caribou is currently one of the most signicant at risk
species in Canada, attributable to its widespread dis-
tribution, its potential susceptibility to climate change,
and its cultural and sustenance signicance to Indige-
nous Peoples. Caribou population monitoring based on
fecal pellet collection at feeding sites in winter has been
proven as an eective sampling method for non-invasive
long-term population monitoring. Host genetic informa-
tion along with metagenomics data for diet and health
indicators from fecal samples can gather a range of pa-
rameters needed to identify factors, including changing
environmental conditions, aecting caribou populations
across Canada. These positions will be supported by
already generated data including a large number of
whole-genome sequences of caribou representing popu-
lations of dierent evolutionary and demographic his-
tories, targeted caribou-specic loci for Population Ge-
nomic surveys from a long-term database of samples
(estimated at 40,000 across Canada) and metagenomics
data (plant and microbiome). The large-scale national
network supporting these positions, under the overall
direction of Dr. Paul Wilson (Trent University) and Dr.94 EvolDir March 1, 2021
Micheline Manseau (Environment & Climate Change
Canada/Trent University), include partnerships with
the Canadian Forest Service, Laval University and the
University of Manitoba; the National Boreal Caribou
Knowledge Consortium, Parks Canada, provincial and
territorial jurisdictions; wildlife management boards;
and industry.
The following positions and areas of research interest
are being recruited:
Post-doctoral fellow in conservation genomics (Dr. Wil-
son and Dr. Manseau, Trent University) with advanced
experience in landscape genetics/genomics to focus on
areas such as factors aecting population structure and
population demographic status, adaptive potential of dif-
ferent caribou ecotypes and populations. This work will
inform management decisions including the identica-
tion of critical habitat and protected areas, permitting
of industrial activities, landscape restoration eorts,
translocation or captive rearing conservation eorts.
Post-doctoral fellow in metagenomics (Dr. Christine
Martineau, Canadian Forest Service and Dr. Arnaud
Droit, Universit e Laval) with experience in developing
and applying a metabarcoding approach targeting multi-
ple taxonomic marker genes to characterize the caribou
diet and microbiome in fecal pellets and relate these re-
sults to population parameters and landscape attributes.
Experience with the analysis of shotgun metagenomics
dataset would be an asset. This work will contribute to
best practices in the design of sampling schemes for diet
and microbiome surveys across caribou ranges and pro-
vide new indicators to monitor the recovery of caribou
populations.
PhD students are also being recruited for questions
relating to of Landscape Genomics, Spatial Struc-
ture/Network analysis, Population modelling and Adap-
tive Genomics.
Applicants should submit a CV, a statement of research
interests, and names and contact information for three
references. The positions will be lled as soon as suitable

Postdoctoral position in statistical ecology
The University of Bordeaux is recruiting a postdoc-
toral researcher with a statistics or quantitative ecol-
ogy/evolution background to work on improving the
identiability of dynamic ecological models, with a fo-
cus on models describing the population dynamics of
interacting species.
Model parameters are unidentiable when several pa-
rameter values give rise to identical likelihoods, which
causes frequent issues in nonlinear and/or dynamic mod-
els. While statisticians have long known about such
diculties [1, 2] these remain often neglected in the
ecological and quantitative biology literatures, and have
only recently become more mainstream [3, 4]. Eco-
logical models of community dynamics, with several
species interacting with each other, are particularly
prone to identiability issues since interactions between
species greatly increase model dimensionality, making
sometimes \inverse estimation" from population counts
impossible. Combining multiple data streams in mecha-
nistic models has been highlighted as a way forward to
improve model identiability [5, 6], especially in highly
stochastic settings, bringing the philosophy of integrated
population models [7] up to the community level.
The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Fr ed eric Bar-
raquand at the Institute of Mathematics of Bordeaux.
The postdoc position is part of a larger project where we
plan to t integrated predator prey models for birds (col-
laboration with Olafur Nielsen, Icelandic INH; Olivier
Gimenez, CNRS Montpellier) and explore the statis-
tical properties of competitive/mutualistic models of
primary producer communities (with Florian Hartig,
University of Regensburg; Matteo Detto, Princeton Uni-
versity). The recruited postdoc will have opportunities,
depending on her or his interests, to work on:
- formal aspects of identiability of stochastic dynamical
systems with interacting species - developing software
for assessing model identiability and combining various
datasets - integrated model tting on case studies or
simulated data sets
We are looking for a researcher with a strong statistics
and/or modelling skillset, able to work in a team. Pro-
ciency in coding (e.g. R, C/C++) is expected and
some applied bayesian statistics (e.g. in Jags or Stan)March 1, 2021 EvolDir 95
would be very valuable. A good working knowledge of
population dynamics or food web/competition models
would be a plus.
The position is funded for 2.5 years (with salary based
on experience) by a French National Research Agency
grant to F. Barraquand. The position may start anytime
from spring 2021 to late fall 2021. Informal enquiries
are welcome. To formally apply, applicants should send
a cover letter describing their interest in the position,
a curriculum vitae, and name and contact information
of three references (preferably by March 15, though the
review of applications will continue until the position is
lled). Contact: frederic.barraquand@u-bordeaux.fr

We have a research opportunity open at the University
of Glasgow's Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health
& Comparative Medicine (IBAHCM) working in the
Evolutionary Analysis Group and the research team of
Kathryn Elmer and in collaboration with Maureen Bain
(IBAHCM-Vet School) and with project partner Jean
Clobert (CNRS Moulis, France).
We are seeking a motivated, creative, and enthusiastic
postdoctoral researcher for a project on the genetic basis
of oviparous and viviparous reproductive modes, funded
by NERC. The project will advance reproductive biol-
ogy by using rigorous experimental tests and functional
evolutionary genomics to reveal the molecular basis of
reproductive mode evolution and scrutinise a putative
reversal. This will be accomplished using the powerful
natural framework of a species (the common lizard) with
both reproductive modes. The research aims to identify
gene expression and describe ultrastructural featuresof reproductive tissue; determine the genetic basis of
gene expression regulation; and reconstruct the genome-
wide evolutionary history across all extant lineages. The
project will likely involve some periods of research stay
in Moulis. Related side-projects are also possible and
supported.
A strong track record of evolutionary and/or develop-
mental biology and/or genetic research is necessary, and
on vertebrates (or even squamates) is a benet. The
ideal candidate will have a weight of experience in de-
velopmental biology (some of in situ hybridisation, his-
tochemistry, microscopy, etc) AND/OR in evolutionary
genomics and biology (some of comparative genomics,
transcriptomics, genetics) AND/OR reproductive physi-
ology or biology.
Animal husbandry and molecular lab work experience
would be valuable; eldwork skills would be advanta-
geous. Team working and collaborative attitude are a
must.
The position is for 3 years, with exible start date
in spring/summer 2021 (preferred 1 June 2021). The
position is open at grade 6 (early postdoc; research as-
sistant) or grade 7 (more experienced postdoc; research
associate).
International applicants will be eligible for a UK work
visa supported by the University of Glasgow. We strive
to be a supportive environment and welcome a diversity
of applicants!
IBAHCM is a stimulating and interactive research envi-
ronment with a wealth of opportunities for discussion,

tion It is widely recognized that genetic diversity is a
primary determinant of whether populations can rapidly
adapt to new challenges. Yet despite its relevance to
basic evolutionary biology and conservation, our under-
standing of adaptive potential is still quite lacking. Our
lab is interested in which types of genetic diversity are
most important for adaptive potential (e.g. neutral vs.
adaptive variation) and how best to estimate adaptive
potential within and among populations.
* Fundamental Population Genetic Inference from Pop-
ulation Dierentiation We are interested in leverag-
ing large data sets (such the >1000 genomes from our
Drosophila Genome Nexus) to ask foundational popula-
tion genetic questions. Most relevant studies have only
considered data from a single population, whereas we are
especially interested in utilizing genetic dierentiation
between populations to address classic but unresolved
questions about the inuence of natural selection on
genomic diversity, such as the relative importance of
selective sweeps and background selection.
Our research group was founded 9 years ago and cur-
rently includes 1 postdoc and 4 graduate students. I
have also advised 5 former postdocs, and the publi-
cation records of Amir Yassin and Justin Lack show
what a productive environment our lab can be. I also
welcome postdocs taking important components of our
research with them when they found their own labs. Fur-104 EvolDir March 1, 2021

Subject: Postdoc: UW-Madison.VirusGenetics
Postdoctoral opportunity at Wisconsin Preliminary ap-
plications due 20 Feb 2021 for June 2021 start
The GEOPop Grand Challenge
A key challenge of biology is to map interactions be-
tween genomes (G) and their environments (E) to pre-
dict tness correlates of an organism (O) and ultimately
forecast population-level (Pop) ecological and evolu-
tionary dynamics; this is the GEOPop grand challenge.
Recent advances in computational modeling and high-
throughput quantitative phenotyping have set the stage
to address this challenge; machine-learning can now es-
tablish sequence-to-function models for individual genes[1], biophysical modeling can integrate multiple gene
functions in dierent environments to predict growth
and correlates of tness [2], and genome-wide rates of
spontaneous mutation can reveal evolutionary potential
[3]. To pursue the GEOPop challenge for viruses, a
team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is forming
around a core of computational and experimental investi-
gators: Philip Romero (biochemistry), Nathaniel Sharp
(genetics), and John Yin (systems biology of viruses).
We seek candidates for a postdoctoral traineeship to join
the GEOPop team. The strongest applicants will pos-
sess experience and publications in two or more of the
following areas: machine learning of biomolecular struc-
ture/function, mathematical modeling of biophysical
processes; high-throughput molecular or virus pheno-
typing, deep mutational scanning, protein engineering,
molecular virology; or evolutionary genetics, population
genetics.
This postdoctoral trainee has potential to be supported
through opportunities at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison; applicants must be U.S. citizens or hold
permanent resident status. To apply, submit a CV,
cover letter, and contact info for three references to
john.yin@wisc.edu by 20 Feb 2021 for full consideration.
Women, minorities, and others who are underrepre-
sented in science, technology, engineering, and mathe-
matics, are especially encouraged to apply.

PolygenicAdaptation Jun13-Jul15
Towards an Integrative View of Adaptation: Bridging
Population and Quantitative Genetics
Coordinators: Alison Etheridge, Kavita Jain, Christian
Schl otterer, and Naomi Wray
Location: KITP Santa Barbara, California
Dates: Jun 13, 2022 - Jul 15, 2022
APPLICATION DEADLINE: March, 1, 2021
https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/adapt22 The
study of adaptive evolution in molecular population
genetics and quantitative genetics have remained rather
isolated disciplines despite the shared research theme.
While quantitative genetics describes adaptation of
quantitative traits as a collective eect due to small
shifts in the allele frequencies of a large number of un-
derlying genetic loci (polygenic adaptation), molecular
population genetics has focused on adaptation due to a
small number of favorable loci in which the allele frequen-
cies sweep to xation. The connection between these
two areas became possible when molecular markers were
introduced. Since then Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)
mapping and, more recently, Genome-Wide Association
Studies (GWAS) developed into powerful approaches
to link phenotypes of interest with their genetic basis.
Furthermore, stochastic models of evolution that bor-
row techniques from statistical physics provided a link
between the bottom-up and top- down approaches in
understanding adaptive dynamics. As a result, it is now
becoming increasingly clear that both \sweeps" and
\small shifts" are rather the endpoints of a scale than
exclusive alternatives.
This program will bring together theoreticians and em-
piricists to develop the basis for a unied framework of
adaptive genetic architectures. The new framework will
integrate molecular population genetics and quantitative
genetics, addressing three main questions:
1. What are the dierent adaptive scenarios that need
to be distinguished and what are their dening charac-
teristics?
2. What are the key factors that determine these sce-
narios?
3. How can we develop powerful statistical tests to
detect polygenic adaptation from empirical data?
KITP programs provide a fantastic opportunity for sci-entic exchange and interdisciplinary collaboration.
A typical day starts with 2 lectures and includes ample
opportunity for discussion. In the afternoon we will have
discussion groups and workshops on specic subtopics
as well as bottom up activities of the participants. Long-
term participants will be provided oce space at KITP.
The scientic activities will be accompanied by joint
social events such as BBQ, wine tasting or beach vol-
leyball. Social and scientic interactions are facilitated
with many long-term participants staying at the Munger
Physics Residence.
Because the program encourages scientists to stay as
long as possible, KITP has several family friendly mea-
sures in place ( https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/visitors/-
before-your-visit/family-fund).
We are aiming to gather a stimulating group of par-
ticipating scientists covering the full spectrum from
theoreticians to experimentalists. Female scientists and
representatives of minority groups are particularly en-
couraged to apply.

Course Overview:
The course will describe dierent aspects and methods
in the eld of functional ecology, combining theoretical
lessons with hands-on real data. Lectures will provide
the theoretical and mathematical basis for dierent ap-
plications of functional traits at organismal, community
and ecosystem levels, with examples across dierenttrophic levels. This will serve as a basis for exploring
the practical tools to connect the eect of land-use and
climate change on biodiversity to the eect of biodiver-
sity on to multiple ecosystem functions and ecological
services. An overview of existing computational meth-
ods, including recent developments authored by the
lecturers, will be provided during the course and the
students will learn how to apply them using functions
and scripts run in R. Students are welcome to apply
these tools to their own data, or use the data provided,
to be analysed during the course while beneting from
advise by the lecturers. As such, compared to other
courses given by the lectures, this is a slightly a more
advanced and data oriented course which concentrates
on detailed and practical aspects in functional traits
related applications, especially computational ones. The
aim of the course is to provide participants with a handy
synthesis of existing concepts, tools and trends in func-
tional ecology and guide them to apply these tools to
their own eld of interest. As the eld of functional
ecology is rapidly expanding, participants will be ready
to exploit the potential of the main trait approaches.

Online GWAS May17-21
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 2nd edition of the
Physalia course \Introduction to genome-wide associa-
tion studies (GWAS)" which will be delivered remotely
in May (17th - 21st)
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course49/ )
Instructors: 1) Dr. Filippo Biscarini (CNR, Italy); 2) Dr.
Oscar Gonz alez-Recio (INIA, Spain); 3) Dr. Christian
Werner (University of Edinburgh, UK)
OVERVIEW
This course will introduce students, researchers and
professionals to the steps needed to build an analysis
pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
The course will describe all the necessary steps in-
volved in a typical GWAS study, which will then be
used to build a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics
pipeline.
FORMAT
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include introductory lectures with class discus-
sions of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, results will
be interpreted and discussed in group.TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at students, researchers and profes-
sionals interested in learning the dierent steps involved
in a GWAS study using them to build a structured
pipeline for semi-automated and reproducibile GWAS
analyses. It will include information useful for both
beginners and more advanced users. We will start by
introducing general concepts of GWAS and bioinfor-
matics pipeline building, progressively describing all
steps and putting there seamlessy together in a general
workow. Attendees should have a background in biol-
ogy, specically genetics; previous exposure to GWAS
experiments would also be benecial. There will be a

scRNAseqWithRBioconductor
Jun7-11
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 3rd edition
of the course \single-cell RNA-seq analysis with
R/Bioconductor", which will be delivered remotely in
June (7th-11th)
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course18/ )
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the eld of single-cell RNA sequencing. We will
cover a range of software and analysis workows that
extend over the spectrum from the best practices in the
ltering scRNAseq data to the downstream analysis of
cell clusters and temporal ordering. This course will help
the attendees gain accurate insights in pre-processing,
analysis and interpretation of scRNAseq data.
We will start by introducing general concepts about
single-cell RNA-sequencing. From there, we will then
continue to describe the main analysis steps to go from
raw sequencing data to processed and usable data. Fi-
nally, we will focus more specically on the dierent
analyses strategies to use in order to extract informa-
tion from genomic datasets such as Hi-C, ATAC-seq or
ChIP-seq.
Throughout the workshop, bash tools and
R/Bioconductor packages will be used to analyse
datasets and learn new approaches.

Safer Science: Strategies to protect at-risk researchers
when conducting eldwork
Join the conversation: #SaferScience
As a result of identity prejudice, certain individuals are
more vulnerable to conict and violence when they are
performing scientic work in the eld. To help create
change and best practices, everyone within the scientic
community will benet from learning more about the
risks some colleagues face performing eldwork. Join
this live webinar to learn more.
At this event, Amelia-Juliette Demery and Monique
Pipkin will present their Nature Ecology and Evolution
paper titled, \Safe eldwork strategies for at-risk individ-
uals, their supervisors and their institutions <https://-
www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01328-5 >." The
paper presentation will be followed by a moderated dis-
cussion with inter-disciplinary experts in eldwork and
diversity and inclusion. Participants are encouraged to
submit questions upon registration.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
AfterwordMarch 1, 2021 EvolDir 115
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
