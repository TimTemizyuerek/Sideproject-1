\We are happy to invite you to take part in the 7th Inter-
national Choanoagellates & Friends meeting https:/-
/choanomeeting2019.wordpress.com/, held from May
24th to 27th 2019 in Barcelona (Spain) and orga-
nized by the Multicellgenome Lab (MCG) (http://-
multicellgenome.com/) at the Institute of Evolutionary
Biology (CSIC-UPF) (https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/).
This meeting is organized every two years and always
attracted researchers working on choanoagellates and
other close unicellular relatives of animals, creating a
friendly and creative growing community. The goal of
the meeting will be to build the choanoagellate research
community by fostering collaborations, disseminating
new techniques and resources, and providing a forum
for presenting cutting-edge research on choanoagellate
biology. Because the meeting will be organized by the
MCG lab, this will also be a great opportunity to expand
the focus of the meeting to other unicellular holozoans.
Early registration is now open until February 15th. We
invite registrations from researchers at every stage oftheir careers, with interests in choanoagellates, lastere-
ans, ichthyosporeans and other unicellular holozoans.
We will use the registration information to request spon-
sorship and arrange the meeting programme. In previous
years, the funding obtained from sponsorship has led
to relatively low registration fees, and we expect the
registration fee to be symbolic. More details will come
soon, so stay tuned! 

Deadline for Abstract Submission: 11th January 2019
https://www.fsbi.org.uk/abstract-submission/ Over the
last ten years the use of environmental DNA (eDNA)
has become one of the most promising new approachesto obtain biodiversity data in aquatic environments,
especially for sh. The technologies which underpin
eDNA research evolve constantly, leading to a rapidly
increasing quality and quantity of data. This has opened
up exciting new opportunities for applied and funda-
mental research alike, but also challenges in terms of
data analysis and interpretation. eDNA methods are
rapidly penetrating biomonitoring for management pur-
poses and increasing our understanding of ecological
interactions within communities and of the drivers for
biodiversity decline. Sessions on eDNA have become
a regular feature of sheries and ecological conferences
but to date there has been no dedicated conference for
eDNA research.
This symposium will, for the rst time, bring together
the international community of sh eDNA research and
provide an overview of the eld. We are adopting a
broad denition of eDNA to include DNA which has
not been sampled directly from the targeted organism,
including DNA extracted from water and sediment as
well as from faecal and gut samples. Topics will range
from the development of methods to addressing funda-
mental ecological questions, as well as applied aspects
of biodiversity monitoring and include:
- Fisheries and conservation issues in freshwater and
marine sh communities
- Monitoring and predicting the spread and impact of
invasive sh
- Molecular food webs and trophic interactions
- Fish pathogen and parasite detection
- The dynamics and ecology of sh eDNA in the envi-
ronment
- Methodological advances, incl. metagenomics, popula-
tion level analysis, new technologies
- eDNA based monitoring and translation into policies

Understanding parallel origins of industrial metal toler-
ance in Silene uniora
Climate change, urbanisation and exploitation of natu-
ral resources increasingly alter the environment, posing
signicant challenges for plants and animals. For species
to adapt to such fast paced change, they will either need
to draw on new genetic variation, which is likely to
emerge very slowly, or on existing standing variation,
which is potentially very fast. Another possibility is
that adaptive alleles will be acquired via hybridisation
with closely related species, facilitating rapid adapta-
tion through the re-use of existing adaptive variation.
Repeated evolution of the same adaptive trait oers
unique opportunities to investigate genetic underpin-
ning of rapid adaptation, ultimately informing us about
the extent to which evolutionary responses to a changing
climate might be predictable.
This project will advance our knowledge of the ecological
and genetic mechanisms underpinning multiple origins
of adaptation to heavy metal contaminated soils in Si-
lene uniora (sea campion) and whether hybridisation
has facilitated or hindered adaptation. Sea campion is a
predominantly coastal species, native to the UK and Ire-land. It has also colonised and adapted to contaminated,
disused mines on at least three separate occasions in
Wales, England and Ireland within the last 250 years.
Silene uniora also occurs in mainland Europe (Swe-
den, France and Spain) and it hybridises with its sister
species, S. vulgaris, which has also evolved heavy metal
tolerance in European sites. Training in laboratory tech-
niques for High throughput DNA sequencing, statistical
analysis in R, bioinformatics, genomics and adapta-
tion genetics will be provided. Hosted in the vibrant
Molecular Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Laboratory in
Bangor (http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/index.php.en) the
student will join a new team led by Alex Papadopulos
(http://labadopulos.co.uk) researching the genetics and
genomics of adaptation in plants.
Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Honours
Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in subjects such as En-
vironmental or Natural Sciences. Applicants with rst
class degrees and/or high-quality Masters qualications
are especially encouraged to apply.

AntPlantInteractions
A *PhD Studentship* is available to work on
*Testing impacts of ant-plant protection mutualisms on
plant community dynamics in Papua New Guinea*
A highly motivated postgraduate student is sought to
join a project exploring the eects of ant inhabitation of
trees on plant community dynamics. Usually proximity
to adult conspecics reduces survival of plant seedlings
due to sharing of natural enemies between adult trees
and seedlings. We seek to test the hypothesis that for
plants regularly inhabited by ants that protect them
from herbivory, proximity to adult trees is benecial due
to ant partner sharing. We will also explore whether this
process is likely to aect the dynamics of entire plant
communities. The student will conduct eld surveys for
ant-inhabited trees, measure ant and plant tness cor-
relates, and perform experimental seedling transplants.
There will also be opportunities to develop the project
in a direction of the students own choosing. Duties will
include spending extensive periods of time in the eld
in Papua New Guinea.
The successful applicant will join the Ant Research
Group ( http://antscience.com/) at the Institute of
Entomology, Biology Centre Academy of Sciences,

is a dynamic, multinational group studying ant ecology,
evolution and biogeography, and is embedded within
the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology,

MEME: Application Cohort 2019 open
MEME (mobility European Master in Evolution) is a
two-year research oriented master program for talented
and motivated students who are interested in under-
standing evolution in all its facets. It intends to provide
an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral studies
and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the programis not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four Euro-
pean universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands;
University of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,
Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA). Together, this consortium has put together an
attractive multidisciplinary program that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at (at least)
two partner universities, and they will receive a double
degree from two partner universities they have attended.
Details on the program and the selection procedure can
be found on www.evobio.eu . Starting date: 1 Septem-
ber 2019
Application deadline: 1 February 2019

GoettingenU HostShiftWolbachia
<pre>The Johann-Friedrich-Blumenbach Institute
of Zoology and Anthropology at the Georg-August-
Universit at Gottingen is looking to ll the position of
a
*Doctoral / Ph.D. Student*
for research on Analysing host-shift patterns of Wol-
bachia strains (Alphaproteobacteria) using comparative
genomics.
The position is funded by the German Science Founda-
tion (DFG) for a period of three years, with a salary
according to the German salary scale TV-L E13 (65%),
and should be lled by March 2019.
Wolbachia is a group of maternally inherited intracellular
Alphaproteobacteria found in arthropod and nematode16 EvolDir January 1, 2019
hosts and based on meta-analyses, up to 52% of all ter-
restrial arthropod species are estimated to be infected.
However, pathways of horizontal transfer between dier-
ent hosts remain to be elucidated. Within the proposed
project we will use a phylogenomic approach to com-
pare the relative contribution of phylogeny, ecology, and
biogeography on horizontal transmission of Wolbachia
strains among arthropods. For this purpose we will
screen the infection status of arthropod communities of
four selected plant species in Germany and the USA.
Using NGS techinques, metagenomes comprising host
and Wolbachia DNA will be sequenced and assembled
for selected individuals of infected arthropod species.
Finally, comparative phylogenetic approaches will be
used to test hypotheses regarding horizontal transfer of
Wolbachia between dierent arthropod hosts.
Applicants need to hold a diploma or MSc degree in bi-
ology or a related eld and to have solid experience with
molecular methodology, particularly with respect to
molecular systematics. Experience in generating and/or
analysing next generations sequencing data is desirable.
A background in entomology would be helpful, but is
not necessary. Working language is German and English.
Doctoral students are supposed to take part in seminars
and supervising students. This position is designed to
foster young researchers and scientists and give the suc-
cessful applicant the opportunity to pursue a doctoral
degree.
The University of Gottingen is an equal opportunities
employer and places particular emphasis on fostering
career opportunities for women. Qualied women are
therefore strongly encouraged to apply in elds in which
they are underrepresented. The university has com-

Project objectives:
Social interactions are among the most fascinating as-
pects of animal behaviour. In an international project,
we study the diversity of mating and parental behaviour
in birds. The PhD project we are to initiate will fo-
cus on the demographic drivers of sex role reversal in
shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers and allies), when fe-
males compete for mates and males provide parental
care. Our team is carrying out cutting edge research in
ecology, behaviour and evolution (see references below,
and our websites), our recent studies suggest that sex
role reversal occur in species where males are the more
common sex, however, the processes that generate such
male-skewed sex ratios are largely unknown. The suc-
cessful candidate will carry out eld study of the sex role
reversed, polyandrous Bronze-winged Jacana in India,
and join an international team of scientists working on
shorebird ecology, behaviour and conservation.
This exciting project will collect data on the breeding
behaviour, ospring sex ratio, and survival of males and
females in a closely monitored population of jacanas.
Based on these data the Student will use demographic
modelling to estimate the adult sex ratio of the pop-
ulation, and test which demographic parameters are
the most important determinants of the sex ratio. The
project will also contribute to our largescale compara-
tive studies that will investigate yet untested aspects of
breeding behaviour and demography in shorebird species
worldwide. The Student is also expected to promote
biodiversity conservation using shorebirds as key organ-
isms, see the ~ALVONAL SHOREBIRD SCIENCE at
https://elvonalshorebirds.com/ Expected motivation
and skills for candidates:
We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic
person with a background in biology, zoology or relevant
discipline, a good understanding of evolutionary biol-
ogy and interest to learn eld biology and laboratory
methods. The candidate should have sucient English
language skills, and the ability of organising and con-
ducting eld work in remote areas in an international
team. He/she also needs to have a solid background in
data analyses preferably in R, and statistical modelling.
Funding:
We welcome applications from self-funded students and
students seeking their own funding from external sources.
The studentship will be based at University of Pannonia,
Veszpr em, Hungary, and involve inputs from colleagues
at University of Bath (UK) and University of Debrecen
(Hungary).Students from India are eligible for the \Stipendium
Hungaricum" program which oers a scholarship for
suitable students ( www.stipendiumhungaricum.hu). In-
terested students should send an application to Prof

Sex roles (i.e. courtship, competition for mates, pair
bonding and parenting) are among the most diverse
social behaviour. Recent research is uncovering key ele-
ments of sex role variation, but signicant gaps remain.
Appropriate sexual behaviour is essential for reproduc-
tion, and thus understanding the causes and implications
of sex roles are at the core of evolutionary biology and
fundamental for the study of life history evolution, physi-
ology and population biology. Understanding sex roles is
also important for biodiversity conservation since disrup-
tions to normal sexual behaviour due to environmental
changes reduce the viability of wild populations.

PhD: Behavioral Ecology and Social Evolution of Wasps
Application deadline: December 31th, 2018
Start date: as soon as possible (but negotiable depend-
ing on KU Leuven application procedure and visa)
We invite applications for a 3-year PhD position on
the evolution of eusociality in wasps. We will focus on
the co-option and modication of the hormonal and
reproductive cycles that were present in solitary species
during the evolution of primitive and advanced eusocial
wasp species. Specically, we will compare European
and Brazilian primitively and advanced eusocial species
of wasps with closely related solitary ones to test whether
and how endocrine JH (juvenile hormone) cycles in pre-
social ancestors regulated reproduction, reproductive
signalling and division of labour. The PhD candidate
will investigate these questions using behavioural exper-
iments, chemical analyses, and molecular analyses.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate, not
afraid of collecting wasps nests, with an MSc degree (or
equivalent) in Biology or a related eld. The successful
applicant should have a strong background in ecology,
animal behaviour and/or evolutionary biology. The can-

A PhD position is available for 3 years in the group of
Dr. Stefan Laurent at the Department of Comparative
Genetics and Development, MPI for Plant Breeding
Research in Cologne, Germany (www.laurentlab.org;

solid skills in R or other programming languages are
especially encouraged to apply.
Adaptive evolution requires that living populations are
able to occasionally modify the spatio-temporal patterns
of expression of some of their genes. Such adaptations
can be achieved by means of positive selection acting
on the genetic variation naturally occurring within gene
regulatory regions. New data sets describing intra- and
inter-specic genetic variation and the localization of cis-
regulatory elements now allow evolutionary biologists
to reveal the genetic determinism of gene regulatory
adaptations. However, non-adaptive forces too, are ex-
pected to shape the genetic variation at cis-regulatory
modules and to drive the evolution of gene expression.
Therefore, mechanisms such as genetic drift and back-
ground selection have to be carefully considered when
reconstructing the evolutionary history of regulatory
systems. The successful applicant will develop statisti-
cal and bioinformatics tools to evaluate the respective
contributions of adaptive and neutral forces in shaping
the genetic diversity at gene regulatory regions. Poten-
tial for applications and collaboration exist with our
colleagues from the group of Prof. Miltos Tsiantis, the
Director of the Department who recently sequenced full

*PhD studentship available on the role of hybridization
during biological invasions*
The Hodgins lab (Monash University,

University of Melbourne) are currently seeking an
outstanding PhD candidate interested in studying
plant ecological genomics. Funding is provided by
an Australian Research Council Discovery grant, in
collaboration with Dr Loren Rieseberg (University of
British Columbia).
Hybridisation has been thought to aid invasion by in-
troducing genetic novelty, but traditional approaches
have been ineective at evaluating alternatives. This
deciency will be addressed by capitalising on replicate
hybrid zones of the same species, applying new methods
on an expansive genomic dataset, and developing novel
simulations to resolve how hybridisation and colonisa-
tion interact. The expected outcome will be a rigorous
empirical evaluation of three candidate processes. This
project has the potential to signicantly advance our
understanding of how colonisation and hybridisation
shape the evolutionary trajectory of species in general.
The project can commence any time during 2019 and
will be developed in collaboration with the student.
Teaching is not required for the duration of the PhD
(3.5 years in Australia). Research funding as well as
attendance in one conference per year is guaranteed.
Successful candidates will be fully funded for 3.5 years
with an annual tax-free stipend of approximately $26,000
AUD, which includes tuition and medical cover. A fully
funded PhD stipend is available for either an interna-
tional student or a domestic student.

Dear All,
We are currently seeking highly motivated PhD student
for a fully-funded project to start in 2019. The project
will focus on analysing molecular data from museum
and modern samples to unravel the population histories
of endemic vertebrates in SE Indonesia.
The Wallacea region of Indonesia hosts an exceptionally
distinctive vertebrate diversity, with endemics such as
anoa, babirusa and maleo. Yet this biogeographically-
complex region is emerging as a new frontier in Indonesia
for agribusiness, and land-use change may have detri-
mental impacts on this regions large endemic forest
vertebrates.
To predict future population changes under dierent
land-use scenarios, we will study past changes. The
availability of range-wide georeferenced anoa, babirusa
and maleo specimens in museums means that we can
obtain genomic information from samples that pre-date
recent changes in land-use. The aim of this project is to
model changes in population size using nuclear and mito-
chondrial (mtDNA) genome-wide levels of genetic diver-
sity from past and present samples, to reconstruct the
population history of these species and assess whether
signals of population declines, detected by our previous
study [1] were induced by recent deforestation.

CichlidAdaptationGenomics
PhD position in Cichlid Fish Evolutionary Genomics in
the Svardal lab at the University of Antwerp
Application deadline January 13, 2019
The Svardal lab at the University of Antwerp (Belgium)
has a PhD position available in evolutionary genomics
of Lake Malawi cichlid shes and is looking for talented
and highly motivated candidates to start in April 2019
(starting date negotiable).
The hundreds of closely related but ecologically diverse
species of Lake Malawi cichlids provide an exceptional
model to study the genomic mechanisms involved in
rapid adaptation and diversication. We are working
on understanding both the fundamental evolutionary
processes involved in the formation of new species and
the molecular basis of adaptive phenotypes. Our main
scientic approach is the analysis of large-scale genome
sequencing data using population genetic and statisti-
cal genomic techniques. Recently, we have also estab-
lished experimental populations of Lake Malawi cichlid
shes, aiming to study physiological and behavioural
phenotypes involved in rapid adaptation to heavy shing
pressure. PhD topics include:
- Understanding the role of old genomic variation in
rapid adaptation. We have recently found that Lake
Malawi cichlids harbour genomic regions of exceptionally
high genetic diversity (Svardal et al., in preparation).
This project focuses on analysing recent whole-genome
sequencing data of hundreds of Lake Malawi cichlid sh
species to infer the evolutionary origin of genomic re-
gions of high genetic diversity. Accordingly, we seek to
test whether the ancestor of Lake Malawi cichlids ob-
tained these genetic variants by hybridisation with a di-
vergent lineage of cichlid sh and whether this variation
has been maintained by balancing selection. Secondly,
population genetic methods will be used to identify the
role of these genetic variants in ecological adaptation
and speciation.
- Uncovering the genetic basis of recent adaptation to
intensive shing using museum genomics. Besides their
role as a model system in speciation research, Lake
Malawi cichlids are food for millions of people, and suf-
fer a recent and strong increase in shing pressure. Some
cichlid populations have seemingly adapted their life22 EvolDir January 1, 2019
histories to intense shing by maturing at substantially
smaller sizes compared to less intensively shed popula-
tions. This project involves analysing genome sequenc-
ing data from museum collections spanning 130 years in
order to identify genetic variants, genes, and molecular
pathways evolving in response to sheries-induced selec-
tion. Together with dierential gene expression analysis
and trait mapping in laboratory populations (option-
ally as a separate project) this will yield unprecedented
insight into the molecular and phenotypic responses to
shing, a question of global importance.
Desired qualications - Master's degree in Biology, Math-
ematics, Computer Science, or a related eld - Under-
standing of the basic principles of population genetics
and strong motivation to develop further quantitative
skills in this eld - Some experience with computa-
tional data analysis, statistics, and programming (e.g.,
R, Python, command line) and strong motivation to
acquire further skills in these elds
We oer - An attractive doctoral scholarship for 4 years
(contingent on positive evaluation after 2 years) - Great
genomic and computational resources and sh facilities
- Funds for conference travel and the option to engage
in eld work in Africa - A stimulating, international
working environment

amaranth includes multiple incomplete domestication
events with frequent and ongoing gene ow from wild
relatives. We will develop and study experimental popu-
lations as well as analyze whole genome sequencing data
from germplasm collections to understand the evolution-
ary history of amaranth. We will employ population
genetic and quantitative genetic methods to study the
domestication history of amaranth.

The evolution of avian ight: an aerodynamic perspec-
tive
PhD Studentship at the University of Debrecen, 2019-
2021 Supervisors: Dr. Adam Z. Lendvai & Dr. Gareth
Dyke
The aim of this interdisciplinary research project is to
understand the aerodynamic constraints and conditions
that have shaped the evolution of avian ight and will
draw on palaeontology, evolutionary biology, ecology,
and engineering. The PhD candidate is expected to use
a combination of theoretical modelling, empirical work
(including wind-tunnel experiments) and phylogenetic
comparative analyses to understand the aerodynamics
of non-avian theropod dinosaurs and early birds. The
PhD candidate will collect data across the theropod-
early bird phylogenetic tree, sampling taxa from within
the diverse radiations of non-avian theropods and basal
birds to assess: (i) the function of feathering on the
wings, legs, and tails of theropods and basal avians; (ii)
the sequence in which these characteristics were evolved,
modied, and then nally lost within the basal avian ra-
diation, (iii) the aerodynamic function of diverse lifting
surfaces in relation to phylogeny and ecology in modern
birds.
This project combines a variety of approaches, and
provides opportunities to perform exciting experiments
using cutting-edge engineering facilities and technologies
to understand fundamental questions in evolutionary
biology. The project therefore oers a great opportunity
to learn new skills for the PhD student.
We are looking for a highly motivated student with a
background either in physics or in biology and with the
willingness to venture to new elds to combine existing
knowledge with new approaches. The candidate should
have a good command of English (written and verbal).
A condition of the application is a Masters degree (or
equivalent) in biology, zoology, physics, biophysics or
similar subject.
The student will be based at the University of Debre-
cen (https://unideb.hu/en), the largest university in
Hungary, which has a strong international community.24 EvolDir January 1, 2019

UDebrecen HormonalRegulationA-

The role of IGF-1 signaling in regulating avian life-
histories
PhD Studentship at the University of Debrecen, 2019-
2021 Supervisor: Dr. Adam Z. Lendvai, University of
Debrecen
The evolution of lifespan is a topic of paramount im-
portance in our life and in evolutionary theory as well.
Recent advances in molecular biology have revealed that
an evolutionarily conserved hormonal signaling pathway,
the insulin/insulin-like growth factor pathway may play
an important role in the regulation of lifespan and the
trade-o between reproduction and survival. However,
much less is known about the role of these mechanisms
in free-living organisms, and very little is known about
their role in life-history regulation in birds.
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student who
would be interested to study this question as part of
an international team. The PhD student is expected
to investigate how IGF-1 signaling and related physio-
logical mechanisms regulate reproduction and mortal-
ity using a combination of observational, experimental
and phylogenetic comparative approaches: including (1)
cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling within species
(2) investigating interspecic variation using phyloge-
netic comparative analyses. This project is expected
to produce new, signicant scientic results that may
aect our understanding the evolution of proximatemechanisms driving the diversity of life histories.
This project combines an ecological, evolutionary and
physiological perspective, therefore the PhD position
provides a great opportunity to learn new skills. A
comprehensive training will be provided comprising spe-
cialist scientic training and generic transferable lab and
professional skills. The ideal candidate has an anity
for both lab- and eldwork. The candidate should have
a Masters degree (or equivalent) in biology, zoology or
similar subject. A good command of English (written
and verbal) and the ability to work in team are required.
Interest in data analysis using R, experience in ornithol-
ogy, bird handling and ringing, a valid drivers license
will be an advantage.
The student will be based at the University of De-
brecen (https://unideb.hu/en), the largest university
in Hungary, which has a strong international com-
munity. Students from eligible countries can apply
for a scholarship at theoStipendium Hungaricum 
(www.stipendiumhungaricum.hu). For more informa-
tion, interested candidates should contact Dr Adam Z.
Lendvai (az.lendvai@gmail.com). Applications must in-
clude a CV and a max 2 page cover letter with personal
motivation and the name and contact details of two

https://www.ed.ac.uk/e4-dtp/how-to-apply/our-
projects/project/67 The evolution of a 'selsh'
chromosome
Dr Laura Ross (laura.ross@ed.ac.uk) and Dr Konrad
Lohse (School of Biological Sciences, IEB, University of
Edinburgh)
A project summary
Selsh chromosomes increase their transmission to fu-
ture generations at the expense of other genes in the
genome. This project studies how they aect the repro-
duction and evolution of an insect.
Project background
Selsh genetic elements are stretches of DNA that in-
crease their own transmission to future generations at
the expense of other genes in the genome. Such elements
are widespread, yet how they increase their transmission
and aect the evolution of the species in which they are
found remains poorly understood [1]. The aim of this
project is to understand these questions by studying
the behaviour of a 'selsh' B chromosome in mealybugs
[2] { small plant-feeding insects (gure 1a). This chro-
mosome is not essential to the survival of these insects
and is actually harmful as it reduces their fertility. In-
stead the chromosome spreads through populations by
manipulating male reproduction to increase the rate at
which it is included in sperm (gure 1b). However, not
all individualds seem equally aected and some show
resistance against the B chromosome, possibly limiting
its spread [3] (gure 1c).
Key research questions
The aim of this project is to understand how a 'selsh'
chromosome spreads through populations. How it ma-
nipulates the insect's reproduction to its own benet
and how it aects the evolution of resistance alleles in
populations where it occurs. The tractability of the
study system and the genetic tools provide a unique
opportunity to understand how selsh genetic elements
can shape the way animals reproduce.
Methodology and timeline
This project will combine laboratory experiments, mi-
croscopy, gene expression and genome analyses. There
is also scope for tracking the evolution of the B chromo-
some in natural populations.The rst year of the PhD
will focus on training in the required techniques and
generating sequence data, the second and third years
will involve conducting large- scale laboratory experi-
ments and possibly collecting and analyzing wild speci-
mens.The nal year will focus on nishing the analyses
and preparing manuscripts to disseminate the resultsTraining
A comprehensive training programme will be provided
comprising both specialist scientic training and generic
transferable and professional skills. Specically the stu-
dent will undertake training in the use of molecular wet
lab techniques, the analysis of sequencing data and the
use of microscopy and cytogenetic approaches.
Requirements
Candidates must be highly motivated with a keen inter-
est in evolutionary biology and genetics and a strong
motivation to pursue a scientic career. Previous ex-
perience with genetic techniques and genomic and/or
theoretical analyses would be an advantage.

Location: University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Corn-

Supervision: Dr Erik Postma (University of Exeter), to-
gether with Prof David Studholme (University of Exeter)
and Prof Michael Bruford (Cardi University)
Brief project outline:
Despite a large body of theory describing how geneticvariation and selection shape evolutionary trajectories,
theoretical predictions are often at odds with what we
observe in the real world. Being able to understand
the source(s) of this discrepancy would signicantly ad-
vance our understanding of the evolutionary process and
provide a much-needed understanding of the ability of
population to persist in a world changing at unprece-
dented rates. However, as of yet we lack a comprehensive
understanding of the importance of stochastic versus
deterministic (but unknown) processes in shaping the
evolutionary dynamics of populations.
In this project, you will quantify the importance of
stochasticity in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of
wild populations using a combination of long-term
individual-based morphological, life-history, pedigree
and genomic data to obtain a a unique insight into the
genomics of adaptation in a wild vertebrate and the
evolutionary process in general.

NERC GW4+ funded studentship available on \Devel-
oping to Help: Understanding Social Specialization in
Cooperative Societies'
Location: University of Exeter, Penryn Campus, Corn-
wall, UK
Supervision: Dr Bram Kuijper (University of Exeter),
together with Dr Sinead English (University of Bris-
tol), Prof Jeremy Field (University of Exeter) and Prof
Stuart Townley (University of Exeter).
Brief project outline:
When and how should cooperatively breeding animals
decide whether to become helpers or reproductives?
Cooperative breeders exhibit a broad variety of develop-
mental trajectories, ranging from eusocial insects with
irreversible specialization as queens versus workers, to
vertebrates where individuals exibly revert from help-
ing to reproduction. Between those extremes lies a con-
tinuum of variation in social exibility. Making sense
of this variation is essential to understand the develop-
mental basis of cooperation, yet testable predictions are
currently lacking.
In this project, you will use a combination of evolu-
tionary theory and eld experiments to understand the
development of social behaviours, with the balance be-
tween theory and experiment to be determined by the
student's interests. Field experiments will take place in
the UK (sweat bees) and/or Ecuaduor (silk wasps).
Funding: This project is one of a number that are in
competition for funding from the NERC Great Western
Four+ Doctoral Training Partnership (GW4+ DTP).
The GW4+ DTP consists of the Great Western Four
alliance of the University of Bath, University of Bristol,

ve Research Organisation partners: British Antarctic
Survey, British Geological Survey, Centre for Ecology

Title: Investigating the co-evolution of chromosome
organisation and gene expression Closing date: 18th
January 2019 Informal enquiries to: Dr Marta Farr e '
M.Farre-Belmonte@kent.ac.uk
Project Description Our lab aims to study genome evolu-
tion and the genetic changes associated with individual
and species dierences, applying the newest comparative
and functional genomic techniques and the great wealth
of genomic data available. In particular, we focus on
the dynamics of chromosomal evolution in mammals
and other vertebrates. Although genome and chromo-
some evolution have long been studied, we still know
very little about the functional consequences of these
changes and the role they might have played during evo-
lution. To address these questions, we use rodents and
ruminants as model species and take a multidisciplinary
approach that combines experimental and bioinformatic
analysis.This project will focus particularly on how genomic
changes between closely related ruminant species might
aect gene expression. To do so, the student will rst
detect genomic changes in ruminants using an algorithm
designed in our lab. Then, they will generate and anal-
yse RNA-Seq data for two tissues of cattle, sheep and
red deer, to nally integrate their results with the gross
genomic changes.
The candidate: We are seeking a highly motivated indi-
vidual, excited by the prospect of conducting cutting-
edge research, with a minimum of 2:1 degree in a rele-
vant subject. She/he will have a strong willingness to
work at the interface of wet-lab and bioinformatics, and
demonstrate enthusiasm to learn new skills. Funding:
This is funded by the Graduate Teaching Assistantship
(GTA), which provides nancial support in return for
96 hours of teaching per year. The stipend paid equals
the full UK Research Council rate of pounds 14,777
(rate for 2018/19) plus tuition fees at the Home/EU
rate. International applicants should make provision to
meet the dierence between Home/EU and International

Project summary Understanding how animals use their
habitats in relation to environmental and ecological
factors is fundamental to basic ecological studies, eval-
uating potential exposure to impacts from human ac-
tivities, and assessing species vulnerability to climate
and ecosystem change. Such knowledge is also vital
for spatial conservation planning, including determining
where to site protected areas and evaluating how species
might interact with existing protected areas. Marine
vertebrates are particularly challenging to study because
they are highly mobile, are often in remote areas, and
are dicult to observe directly. However, tagging and
telemetry studies, combined with the growing availabil-
ity of remote sensing data and novel spatial statistical
tools, is allowing the development of large scale habitat
usage for many marine predator species. Such models
are becoming increasingly important for marine spatial
planning. However, such studies are potentially limited
by expense, logistical challenges, and data collection
may be focused on relatively small numbers of focal
species.
In recent years rapid development of high throughput
DNA sequencing technology has facilitated sensitive new
approaches to quantifying biodiversity in environmen-
tal samples, such as soil and water, collectively known
as environmental-DNA (eDNA). These techniques giveJanuary 1, 2019 EvolDir 31
new ways to detect single species of interest, or to pro-
le species communities from trace amounts of DNA
shed into the environment. In the context of marine
ecosystems, eDNA may oer complementary and some-
times alternatives to other established approaches such
as telemetry and population surveys to evaluating the
spatial distribution of biodiversity. Potential benets
include the ability to survey for multiple species simul-
taneously, and across time series and large spatial areas
at relatively low cost.
In this project we will develop and validate new eDNA
tools targeted to monitoring marine vertebrates (with
a focus on cetaceans, and large predatory sh), and
apply them to evaluate spatial and temporal variation
in habitat use by the focal species in the Mediterranean
Sea, and assess to what extent eDNA based surveys
correlate with conventional methods for monitoring ma-
rine biodiversity. The work is a collaboration between
Dr Simon Goodman (University of Leeds, UK) and Dr
Elena Valsecchi (University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy)
within the framework of the MeD for Med project, an
initiative to develop and apply eDNA to biodiversity
monitoring in the Mediterranean Sea.
With support from Italian shipping companies, and
marine mammal observer programmes (run by ISPRA,
Italian Higher Institute for Environmental Conservation
and Research), we will use passenger ferries travers-
ing Mediterranean routes as mobile sampling platforms.
These routes are ideal since they traverse many known
marine biodiversity hotspots, and collaboration with ma-
rine mammal observer programmes allow cross checking
of eDNA results against visual detections of cetaceans.
In addition we will also undertake systematic sampling
of other locations based on existing published data and
models of Mediterranean marine biodiversity, to evalu-
ate the predictive capacity of eDNA tools. Ultimately
such eDNA tools have potential to become an essential
part of biodiversity monitoring tool kits, with direct im-
plication for conservation management, and evaluating
environmental impacts from human activities.
Research context and partners This project is part of a
collaboration involving researchers from the University
of Leeds and University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy. The
student will join the Ecology and Evolution group in the
School of Biology, Leeds, and will be integrated with the

UmeaU EvolutionOfMulticellularity
Overview: A Ph.D. studentship in mathematics as re-
lated to modeling the evolution of multicellularity is
available in the research group of Eric Libby at Ume a
University in Sweden (http://ericlibby.github.io/). Can-
didates should have some quantitative background with
an interest in building mathematical models of biological
systems.
Background for the project: The evolution of multicellu-
larity is considered a major transition for the evolution
of life on earth that made possible signicant increases
in organismal complexity. Somehow single-celled organ-
isms, who were successful in their own right, evolved
to form new kinds of individuals composed of many
cells, multicellular organisms. While multicellularity
has evolved on dozens of independent occasions, these
events occurred millions of years ago and are absent
from the fossil record. Recent experiments, however,
have made it possible to study this pivotal event in the
lab by using microorganisms to evolve primitive multi-
cellularity de novo. Such experimental systems provide
excellent opportunities to test hypotheses about the
conditions that govern major transitions and facilitate
the evolution of additional forms of complexity.
Goal of the PhD project: The goal of this project is to
develop mathematical models that marry theory with
empirical results to uncover general principles of how life
evolves to be complex. Useful modeling techniques in-
clude dierential equations, network approaches, agent-
based simulations, evolutionary analyses, and proba-
bilistic models.
Qualications: Candidates need to be skilled in both
oral and written communication in English, and should
be able to work independently as well as in collaboration
with others. Certain coursework is needed in mathe-
matics (contact Eric or see job posting for detailed
information). Candidates need to have prociency, but
not necessarily documented, in working with computers
and programming, e.g. in Matlab, Python, Julia, C++,
etc. A good background in mathematics, optimiza-
tion, dierential equations, computer science, and/or
programming is qualifying. Interest and knowledge of
evolutionary biology, microbiology, and/or molecular
biology is desirable but not necessary.

ModellingMicrobialInteractions
I am looking to recruit a PhD student to work on math-
ematical modelling of microbial interactions, including
bacteria growth in biolms, bacteria dispersal through
fungal hyphae networks, and bacteria-fungi interactions
under dierent nutritional conditions, in the Univer-
sity of Neuch^ atel, Switzerland. The student will be
co-supervised by Prof. Redouan Bshary and/or Prof.
Pilar Junier.
Bacteria are powerful in breaking down chemicals and
thus have great potentials in treating polluted soils, but
they cannot disperse in the soil without water, and this
limits the applications of bioremediation of polluted
soils. Recently, it is found that bacteria can disperse in
the liquid layer on the surface of fungal hyphae. The
fungal hyphae networks are like a 3D highway system
that connects vast areas in the soil, providing potentially
a very ecient way for bacteria to disperse. But unlike
the highways we're familiar with, the fungal highways
are living organisms and they interact with bacteria
in complex ways. In the PhD project we will nd out
how bacteria spread through fungal hyphae networks,
and whether the interactions between fungi and bacteria
promote or impede the dispersal. In addition, we will
study how nutrients inuence the interactions between
fungi and bacteria. Our pilot experiments have already
shown that the nature of interactions between fungi and
bacteria can change with the concentrations of nutri-
ents. As fungi and bacteria involve in many dierent
types of interactions, they can cooperate and compete
at the same time, it is interesting to nd out how a
mixture of dierent types of nutrients aect the inter-
actions between fungi and bacteria. Understanding the
eects of nutrients can help us nd ways to manipulate
fungi-bacteria interactions in the way that we want.
The PhD project involves both experiments (20%) and
modelling (80%). The successful applicant should have
a Master's degree in mathematics, physics, biology, or
another related eld. A prerequisite is a keen interest
in both mathematical modelling and understanding real
biological systems. Good quantitative skills are essential.January 1, 2019 EvolDir 33
Experience in mathematical modelling and knowledge of
a programming language is an advantage. Experience in
microbiology experiments is preferred but not required,
since the lab skills required by the experiments are basic
and can be learned quickly. The candidate needs to be
uent in English.
To apply, please send an email to <li@evobio.mpg.de

considered). Please include in your email a statement
including 1) your research interests and career plan,

PhD POSITIONS IN EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS
OF SPECIATION
We are looking for two PhD students to join the Daniel
Ortiz-Barrientos and Jan Engelst adter labs during 2019.
Application deadline: January 31, 2019.
Daniel and Jan, together with Takeshi Kawakami were
recently awarded an Australian Research Council (ARC)
grant to study the \Evolution of the recombination
landscape during speciation." We would like to invite
applications from students with quantitative skills (in
development) who are interested in that mystery of mys-
teries: the origin of new species. We are particularly
interested in students who are keen to explore how re-
combination might evolve when populations diverge in
the face of gene ow, and how this may aect patterns
of genomic diversity and divergence.
With his group, Daniel has developed a great system of
study for adaptation and speciation. The daisy Senecio
lautus is a complex of taxonomic species that occurs in
Australia and occupies multiple environments. Of note,
there are two coastal ecotypes that have evolved repeat-
edly and independently multiple times, and with varying
degrees of limited gene ow. Using these replicates, a
recently sequenced genome, and multiple linkage maps,
students will explore both theoretically and empirically
the evolution of recombination rates in this system.
We expect the candidate to work closely with Daniel,
who is an expert on genetics and ecology of adaptation
and speciation, Jan, who is an expert on the evolution
of recombination, and Taki, who is an expert on popu-
lation genomics of speciation. Students are expected to
think deep, to be up to date with the literature, to go to
conferences and mingle, to learn coding and mathemat-
ics (to the required degree to accomplish the research to
a high standard), to be or fall in love with language, and
to position themselves as great speakers. We expect stu-
dents to share their eorts with the scientic community
freely via public data depositories, GitHub, R-packages
etc., and to pursue writing for the general audiencewhile being insightful for their immediate peers.
Students in our laboratories are free to independently
explore ideas around the major scope of the ARC grant,
and are encouraged to collaborate with other students.
We value creative minds, people who are great team
players, and have strong work ethics and integrity. We
like people that want to become better scientists and
better people at the same time, and that will strive
for balance in their day-to-day lives without losing per-
spective of the big picture. We provide a warm and
supportive environment and take seriously the needs
and wishes of everyone in the lab, while at the same
time striving to inspire everyone to do their best they
can. So far, students who have graduated from our labs
have always secured postdoctoral positions, and every-
one has found a path inside or outside academia. We
would work with each one of you to nd your path as
well, and to let you leave our labs being an evolutionary
geneticist whose skills, discipline and imagination can
help change the h orizon of any job you pursue.

Anthropology at the University of Vienna. The project
will be conducted in close collaboration with Prof. Joris
Peters (LMU Munich), and Prof. Ludovic Orlando
(University of Toulouse and University of Copenhagen).
Data generation and analyses will require traveling to
both collaborators labs.
Project Description: Humans have been crossbreeding
wild and domestic members of the family Equidae for
millennia, as illustrated by archaeological, iconographic
and written sources. First-generation equine hybrids
are, however, generally sterile. Maintaining such stocks
thus required considerable wealth, and detecting when
and how such practices developed during history can
provide important information about the organization
of past societies. This project aim at elucidating lo-
cal breeding practices and the contribution of hybrid
equine populations exploited in Germany and Austria in
pre-Roman and Roman times. It will apply a multidisci-
plinary approach combining standard morphology with
Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) and state-of-the-art
methods in ancient DNA research aimed at the detection
of hybrids, and possibly, at the characterization of both
parental stocks. For more information please see https:/-
/www.anthropology.at/news-press-releases/ . Candidate
Background: We are seeking a highly motivated candi-
date with background in molecular biology, population
genetics, bioinformatics or equivalent. Prociency in
written and spoken English is required. Bioinformat-
ics skills (Unix, R, and Python languages) are highly
desired. Direct experience with ancient DNA is highly
desired. Ability to work in a highly-international and
multi-disciplinary team. Prospective student should
demonstrate a desire to learn, work independently, and
multi-task.

Vienna Wolbachia-fruitFlyGenomics
A PhD position is available to study the endosymbiont
Wolbachia in invasive cherry fruit ies. The project is
funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) for three
years.
The eastern cherry fruit y Rhagoletis cingulata is an
important economic pest species infesting cherry species
in its native range in North America. It was recently
introduced to Europe where it co-infests cherries with
the native European cherry fruit y Rhagoletis cerasi.The shared habitat of the two insect species resulted in
the horizontal transmission of a Wolbachia strain from
R. cerasi to R. cingulata. The project aims to study the
early stages of Wolbachia transmission and the spread
of the endosymbiont in nature. Moreover the project
focuses on the invasion history of the y and the po-
tential consequences of the new Wolbachia infection for
invasion success of its host. Our research objective will
be accomplished by whole genome sequencing of dier-
ent Wolbachia strains and by studying the spatial and
temporal distribution of the newly acquired endosym-
biont in natural populations. We will determine the
introduction routes of R. cingulata performing exten-
sive genomic characterization of native and invasive y
populations and perform crossing studies to study the
phenotypic eects of the endosymbiont.
The project will be in collaboration with Lisa Klasson
(Uppsala University, Sweden) and Je Feder (University
of Notre Dame, USA) and will be performed in the lab
of Christian Stauer (Boku, Vienna).
The ideal candidate will have a strong interest in en-
tomology and molecular ecology. Experience in the
application of molecular methods and in generating and
analyzing next-generation sequencing data are helpful.
General requirements for the position are a MSc degree
in Biology, Evolution or in a related eld. The candidate
should have excellent communication skills and should
be uent in English. The working language in the labo-
ratory is English. German skills, although helpful, are
not essential. PhD candidates have to enrol at Boku
www.boku.ac.at/en/ . The position is based at the Uni-
versity of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Boku
https://www.boku.ac.at/ in Vienna. Salary is according
to the standard personnel costs of the FWF https://-
www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/personnel-costs/ .
To apply, please send an application letter detailing
research background and research interests, your CV,
and the contact information of at least two references to
hannes.schuler@unibz.it. The position is available im-
mediately, but the starting date is negotiable. Review of
applications will begin immediately and continue until
the position is lled.

AGA EECG ResearchAwards
The American Genetic Association grants Evolutionary,
Ecological, or Conservation Genomics (EECG) Research
Awards to graduate and post-doctoral researchers who
are at a critical point in their research, where addi-
tional funds would allow them to conclude their research
project and prepare it for publication.
These awards are open to any PhD student or postdoc-
toral fellow who is a member of the AGA at the time of
application - visit the AGA homepage for membership
details.
The program is not intended to fund an entire research
project, to initiate new research projects, or to pro-
vide salary support. Proposals addressing genome-scale
questions, or ecological, evolutionary and conservation
genetics questions best addressed with genome-scale
data, will be given priority for funding. Awards will
generally range from $5,000 to $10,000, awarded to the
PI or institution (no overhead is provided).

AGA SpecialEventsAwards
The American Genetic Association grants awards each
year to its members for support of special events that
advance the mission of AGA, particularly to support
students to attend the event.
Eligible events include specialized workshops and short
courses in topical areas of organismal genetics and ge-
nomics, but any event relevant to AGA's purpose will be
considered, especially those that could lead to Journal
of Heredity articles.

ESEB SpecialTopicNetworks
CallForProposals
***ESEB Special Topic Networks - Call for proposals***
Small symposia, workshops and courses in various for-
mats can perform functions complementary to those of
the ESEB Congresses, allowing more focused interac-
tions within specialist areas, forging new links between
previously separate areas or fostering interdisciplinaryJanuary 1, 2019 EvolDir 63
and innovative ideas that merge specialized elds. One-
o events can be valuable but the returns for connected
series of events can be even greater. Therefore, ESEB in-
vites proposals for Special Topic Networks (STNs) that
will support dynamic and exible series of small meet-
ings and/or other networking opportunities in focused
and currently active research areas.
Each STN will be funded for up to 6 years (subject to
review after 2 and 4 years of operation) with an annual
budget of up to 10 000 Euros. Four STNs have been
initiated since the start of the initiative (see https://-
eseb.org/prizes-funding/special-topic-networks/), and
further STNs will be initiated every other year. The
format of these STNs is up to their organisers and inno-
vative ideas are encouraged. All elds of evolutionary
biology are eligible. Applicants should provide a pro-
posal with the following components:
1) a description of the research area to be targeted,
showing why it is timely to address it in this way and
outlining the expected benets to the eld from the STN
(max. 1000 words), 2) a plan for the rst two years of
operation of the STN and an outline of activities over
the remaining years (max. 500 words), 3) the names and
aliations of the proposed organisers, with brief (max.
one page) CVs, and 4) a budget, with brief justication,
for the STN activities proposed for the rst two years.
Applicants should also identify an institution that is
prepared to open an account in which the funds can be
deposited and managed by the applicants. 'Overheads'
will not be paid to this institution but reasonable di-
rect administrative costs will be eligible. Funding for
each 2-year block will be subject to approval by the
STN Committee, established by Council, following re-
ceipt of a report of activities in the preceding 2 years.
The institution managing funds will be asked to pro-
vide a certied statement of expenditure to accompany
the report. The principal criterion for renewal will be
evidence that the funding provided had been used to
further interaction in the topic area.
Applications should be sent to the ESEB oce email
(oce@eseb.org) as PDF les by ***31 March 2019***.
Updated versions of previously-submitted proposals are
welcome. Proposals will be assessed by an independent
STN Review Panel, appointed by the STN Committee
following the closing date and ensuring no conict of
interest by panel members. The STN Review Panel will
make funding recommendations to Council. The result
will be announced after the next Council meeting, at
latest on 31 August 2019.
The principal criterion for selection of an STN will be its
focus on an active area of research within the scope of
evolutionary biology. Preference might be given to STNsthat propose new connections between sub-disciplines
or that focus on the resolution of current controversies.
New STNs will address topic distinct from those covered
by currently-funded STNs. A score for this criterion
based on part (1) of the application will account for
50% of the overall panel score. It is primarily for the
proposers to demonstrate the need for an STN, the po-
tential for it to stimulate progress and the activities
that will enable the network to be eective. A typi-
cal STN might organise one small discussion meeting
per year but it might also organise training events and
its members might work together to generate resources
or publications. Interaction among members might be
fostered, between meetings, using social media, online
discussion forums or similar. A score for the eective
and innovative nature of the plans laid out in part (2)
of the proposal will account for 25% of the overall panel
score. The nal 25% of the score will be based on the
budget and adherence to the following guidelines:
1. A proposal should be supported by at least three
ESEB members (membership in date on the closing
date for applications), from at least two and typically
three countries and taking gender issues into account,
who commit to organising the STN for its duration (or
to nding appropriate replacements if forced to step
down). A member should support no more than one
proposal in a given application round and organisers
of current STNs should not be proposers of new STNs.
2. STNs should organise at least one meeting in the
non-Congress year following its inception and one in its
nal non-Congress year. Complementing these meetings
with an innovative range of other activities is strongly
encouraged.

Philosophy of science in Evolution
course
Colleagues,
I'm looking for suggestions of articles on philosophy
of science and logical inference that would be suitable
for an upper-level undergraduate course in evolutionary
biology. I want to have my students read 2-3 articles
about how science works that are aimed at biologists
(or at least not aimed at professional philosophers), and
ideally these would be in the context of one or more
aspects of evolutionary biology. Thus far, my searches
haven't turned up anything quite like what I'm hoping
is out there, so I thought I'd try crowdsourcing it.
I'm not looking for books (there are lots of those) or
discussions of evolution-vs-creationism (lots of those,
too). As it stands, I'll probably use a couple of chapters
from OUP's \very short introduction" to philosophy of
science.
Email any suggestions to me at dudycha <at>

Next on http://phyloseminar.org/: Model Adequacy
of Experimentally Informed Site-Specic Substitution
Models Sarah Hilton (University of Washington, Seattle)
Wednesday, December 12, 2018, 10:00 AM PSTPhylogenetic substitution models are hypotheses about
evolutionary process and, like all models, they contain
simplifying assumptions. One common assumption is
that all sites in a gene evolve identically. However, even
a cursory analysis of a multiple sequence alignment will
show that this assumption is violated in natural protein
evolution. Relaxing this assumption greatly increases
the number of model parameters to account for the
eect of every amino acid at every site in the protein.
We have developed a family of models, called Exper-
imentally Informed Codon Models (ExpCMs), which
describe the site-specic constraints on a protein using
empirical measurements from a high-throughput func-
tional assay in the lab. Even though the vast majority
of the parameters are determined empirically rather
than t to the data, we have found that ExpCMs are
generally better descriptors of natural sequence evolu-
tion than site-uniform codon models, as evaluated by
model comparison techniques such as AIC. Now, we
are turning to model adequacy tests as a more quan-
titative and comprehensive way to evaluate ExpCMs
on a site-by-site basis. We believe that sites which are
inadequate descriptors of natural sequence evolution
may indicate sites where the selective pressure diers
between the lab and nature and point to interesting
biological mechanisms. Model adequacy tests will also
allow us to compare how well experiments performed
under dierent conditions are able to capture natural
constraint. Overall, the site-specic ExpCMs can be
used as a tool to bridge the gap between what we know
about selection in the lab and in nature.

SouthAfrica VolResAssist
MoleRatBehaviour
We are looking for several volunteer research assistants
to carry out exciting experiments with captive Damara-
land mole-rats, Fukomys damarensis at the Kuruman
River Reserve, in the South African Kalahari Desert.
Broadly, our research investigates the inuence of genes,
hormones and social factors on individual developmental,
growth and behaviours. Currently, we are particularly
interested in characterizing the phenotypical dierences
between breeding and non-breeding individuals and to
develop an integrated understanding of the causes and
consequences of contrasts in reproductive output.
Applicants should be available for a period of 6 to 12
months starting as soon as possible. They should be
hardworking, enthusiastic, physically t, and prepared
for long hours in the laboratory. Successful applicants
will be responsible to run experiments and will be in-
volved in data collection (behavioural observations, col-
lection of blood and urine samples). Other general tasks
related to animal handling and husbandry and data
handling will also be expected. Working weeks will not
exceed 45 hours.
This position is particularly suited, but not exclusively,
for people aiming to carry on their academic education
or a management position in a research project. Success-
ful applicants can expect to gain invaluable experience
in animal handling procedures and in conducting and
managing experiments. They will also gain database70 EvolDir January 1, 2019
skills (MySQL) and will be provided with the opportu-
nity to work on a personal analysis project using the
data available in our existing database. Costs of food
and accommodation while at the project will be covered.
If you are interested in this position send your CV and
cover letter stating your availability to Philippe Vullioud
(philippe.vullioud@gmail.com). Shortlisted applicants
will be invited for a Skype interview. Deadline: 15th
December 2018 (the position will however remain open
until lled)

Systematics ResearchFund
The Councils of the Linnean Society (https://-
www.linnean.org/) and the Systematics Association
(http://www.systass.org/) jointly administer the Sys-
tematics Research Fund (SRF) that provides grants
annually for small-scale research projects in the eld of
systematics.
Typical activities supported include contributions to
eldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientic equip-
ment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical equip-
ment), specimen preparation (including the cost of tem-
porary technical assistance), and contributions to publi-cation costs. However, please note that it is unable to
fund the cost of article publication charges. Projects of
a more general or educational nature will also be con-
sidered, provided that they include a strong systematics
component. Typical activities not supported include
attendance at scientic meetings and contributions to
student maintenance or tuition fees. The fund does
not provide payments for Bench Fees. Projects already
substantially funded by other bodies may be disadvan-
taged. Applications of all nationalities are welcome but
applicants must be a current member of the Systematics
Association or Linnean Society of London.
Successful projects are selected by a panel of systema-
tists who represent a wide range of conceptual interests
and taxonomic groups. Generally, applications in the
range of £500- £1000 are preferred, the value of any
single award will not exceed £1500.

Vignettes on
EvolutionaryApplications
Dear EvolDir,
We are seeking your help in developing two-page vi-
gnettes on Applications of Evolution to topics that im-
pact our world in a variety of ways. The concept is
to identify primary research papers that have exciting
applications of evolution to areas of impact on envi-
ronment (climate change, conservation, biotic assembly,
etc.), medicine (infectious disease, genomics, human phe-
notypic variation, etc.), and Society (agriculture, law,
computation, language, etc.). Then develop a lay sum-
mary (2 page, 2 gure/table) of the research topic for use
in teaching eorts at high school, college, and political
levels. We envision graduate seminars and/or lab groups
focused on developing such vignettes and submitting
for peer review via EasyChair https://easychair.org/-
cfp/EvolApps2019. We are developing a distinguished
Program Committee to review vignettes and welcome
additions to the Program Committee as well. The top72 EvolDir January 1, 2019
50 vignettes will be published in a volume by Oxford
University Press with up to four articles winning a cash
prize. We hope faculty and graduate students will orga-
nize around the world and produce exciting vignettes
for submission by our May 31, 2019 deadline. You can
nd more information and some example vignettes here
https://www.evolutionapps.org/. Please let me know ifyou have any questions or need any guidance as your
are developing your Evolutionary Applications!

Forecasting biodiversity losses in Wallacea from ecologi-
cal and evolutionary patterns and processes
We are seeking a highly motivated post-doctoral re-
searcher in genomics and spatial analysis to join an
exciting, NERC-funded project investigating the evolu-
tion and diversication of taxa on the Indonesian island
of Sulawesi. The successful candidate will be one of
two post-doctoral researchers working on this highly
collaborative project with researchers at Bangor Uni-
versity, the University of Aberdeen and the University
of Nottingham. The post-doctoral researcher will join
the Molecular Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Labora-
tory (http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/) at Bangor University
and spend a portion of their time at the University of
Nottingham. The project will integrate state-of-the-
art eco-evolutionary modelling with new and existing
ecological and evolutionary data across eukaryotic taxa
and soil microbes to deliver fresh understanding of the
processes responsible for the generation, diversication,
and persistence of Wallacea's endemic biodiversity. The
project will generate a calibrated model (called ForeWall
' Forecasting for Wallacea) which will forecast biodiver-
sity dynamics across a suite of taxa under alternative
future scenarios of land use and climate change. The
Bangor post-doctoral researcher will collate and analyse
existing spatial and genetic data for the Sulawesi biota
and produce new genomic data for two damsely genera
represented, which are in the process of diversication on
Sulawesi. Additionally, they will also investigate three
groups of soil microbes, which perform a key ecosystem
function (nitrication)
Candidates should hold a PhD (or near completion) in
evolution, ecology or genetics and have research expe-
rience in evolutionary biology, molecular ecology or a
related discipline, preferably in relation to population
genetics of wild organisms. The post-doctoral researcher
will be responsible for the generation and analysis of
genomic data for Sulawesi damselies and metabarcod-
ing data for prokaryotes. They will collate and analyse
existing genetic and spatial data for other Sulawesi
taxa in collaboration with the project's expert partners.
Basic molecular genetic wet lab skills, genetic data han-
dling/analysis skills and eld working experience are74 EvolDir January 1, 2019
essential, as is the ability to work collaboratively on
writing and analysis for publication. Experience in
bioinformatics, population genetic/phylogenetic analy-
sis of genomic data, tropical eldworking, geographic
information systems, and knowledge of genetic analysis
for eukaryotes and prokaryotes is highly desirable.

Can phenotypic plasticity and DNA methylation pro-
mote adaptive radiation?
We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to take a key
role in a NERC funded project investigating the roles
of phenotypic plasticity and DNA methylation during
adaptive radiation, focussing on the cichlid sh model
system. The objective of the project is to test core
principles of this 'plasticity rst' idea using the Eastern
Happy (Astatotilapia calliptera), a phenotypically vari-
able, genomically well characterised, and experimentally
tractable cichlid sh species within the Lake Malawi
radiation. The project is a partnership between the
University of Bristol (Prof. Martin Genner; Dr Jon
Bridle) and Bangor University (Prof. George Turner),
with support from project partners in the Malawi Fish-
eries Research Unit (Dr Harold Sungani), the Tanzania
Fisheries Research Institute (Dr Semvua Mzighani) and
the University of Cambridge (Prof. Eric Miska; Prof.
Richard Durbin). We will test: i) whether plasticity
in traits present among wild populations can direct ge-
netically driven trait divergence, ii) whether patterns
of DNA methylation are repeated in parallel cases of
ecomorphological trait divergence, iii) if dierential gene
expression is linked to methylation during divergence
events, and iv) if DNA methylation shows transgen-
erational stability in sh within stable environments.
This project will provide key insights into the role of
plasticity and DNA methylation in vertebrate evolution.
The project will focus on both wild caught and labora-
tory reared specimens and quantify morphology using
micro-CT scans and geometric morphometrics. Epige-
netic variation will be quantied using a combination
of reduced-representation and whole genome bisulphite
sequencing, while gene expression will be quantied us-
ing RNAseq. Candidates should have a doctoral degree.
They should also have an aptitude for experimentalJanuary 1, 2019 EvolDir 75
design, and enthusiasm for eldwork and analyses of
complex data. Candidates should have experience of
molecular laboratory work, and knowledge of bioinfor-
matics tools. The position is for 36 months, is based at
the University of Bristol.
The closing date for application is 6th January 2019. For

Discovering the genomic basis of the evolution of animal
parasitism
A post-doctoral position funded by the Wellcome Trust
with two years xed funding is available in the lab of
Dr Jordi Paps (University of Bristol) to work on the
genome biology and evolution of parasitic animals.
Roundworms (Nematoda) and atworms (Platy-
helminthes) are among the most species-rich animal
groups, including free-living animals but also parasites.
Helminthiases aect farm animals and plants, and in-
fect more than half of the worldwide human population.
Understanding the genomic basis of the evolution of
parasitism is imperative to ght these parasites with
huge socioeconomic impact.
The candidate will use genomics approaches, assembling
and annotating genome data generated with Illumina
and ONT PromethION platforms, and analysing single-
cell data. Genomes of dierent animals will be compared
using evolutionary genomics approaches. This will pro-
vide new insights into the genomic events, such as gene
gains and losses, associated with the transition from free-
living to parasitic organisms, revealing new therapeutic
targets.
The candidate will have a PhD (or about to submit) in
evolutionary biology and/or bioinformatics, along with
a strong interest in animal evolution and genomics. Es-sential requirements include expertise in programming,
de novo genome assembly and annotation, ability to
work in a team in an interdisciplinary environment, and
prociency in English. Desirable requirements are ex-
perience in phylogenetics, comparative genomics, and
analysis of RNAseq and single cell sequencing data.

GeneDriveRiskAssessmentTheory
Postdoc in Gene Drive Risk Assessment (Theoretical
Biology), Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology
One postdoctoral position (duration of 1 year) is avail-
able in the Gokhale lab at the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen, Germany as a part
of the project funded by the German Federal Agency
for Nature Conservation (Bundesamt fuer Naturschutz).
This theory project aims to assess the risks posed by the
various gene drive systems if they are to be for released
in the European Union. The aim is to assess risks of
existing theoretical and experimental drive systems in
terms of spread, resistance evolution and ethical con-
cerns. Using gene drive mechanisms, desired genes canbe increased in frequency in a target population with
an aim of population transformation, suppression or
even eradication. It typically involves the distortion of
Mendelian inheritance and is thus a property of sexually
reproducing populations. This raises questions about
the risk of spread of such constructs, their penetrance
and ecological eects. Legal and ethical concerns will
also be a major point in policy making.
We are seeking a highly motivated candidate with exper-
tise in theoretical models of population genetics, dynam-
ics and ecological modeling. A prior experience in gene
drive systems modeling is not required but would be
an asset. The project will be developed in close collab-
oration with BOKU (University of Natural Resources
and Life Sciences) in Vienna, Austria. The program is
structured and the output is publication based as the
goal is to provide the BfN with actionable content in
terms of policy making.
Salary and benets are according to the German public
service pay scale (TVoeD Bund) and are commensurate
with training and experience. The Max Planck Society
seeks to increase the number of women in areas where
they are underrepresented, and therefore explicitly en-
courages women to apply. The Max Planck Society is
committed to employing more handicapped individuals
and especially encourages them to apply. Consideration
of applications will begin in February 2019.
The projected start date is in early-mid 2019. Any
informal enquires should be directed to Dr. Chai-
tanya S. Gokhale or to Dr. R. Guy Reeves

FishEvolutionaryEpigenomics
Three year fully funded postdoc in New Zealand on sh
epigenomcis
We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral re-84 EvolDir January 1, 2019
searcher to investigate the role of epigenomic vs genomic
variation in thermal adaptation of a marine sh species,
the Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus). The
postdoc will be based in Nelson, New Zealand, and in
addition, research visits to the Bernatchez laboratory
at Laval University are also planned.

Background This projects seeks to investigate the
relative roles of genomic versus epigenomic variation in
thermal adaptation of a marine sh, the Australasian
snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), to test whether species
can change rapidly through (epigenetic) regulation
of gene expression in response to new environmental
conditions. The postdoc will (1) compare epigenomic
and genomic standing variation of wild snapper
populations along two thermal transects; (2) test F1
inheritance of temperature-induced epigenetic proles
on tness-related traits; and (3) using the progeny
produced in (2), perform a temperature challenge to
test the hypothesis that inherited epigenetic variation
has an adaptive basis, resulting in dierential survival
of progeny based on their epigenetic make-up. This
project takes advantage of a unique combination of
eld population samples, manipulative laboratory
experiments and state-of-the-art genomic resources. It
will make a signicant contribution to understanding
what constitutes the material on which evolution
can act, and contribute to a broader view of what
constitutes heritable variation.
This project will also contribute to a deeper understand-
ing of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic processes,
in particular to elucidate which phenotypes respond to
trans-generational epigenetic transmission and thus clar-
ify the importance of these mechanisms in the adaptive
potential of aquatic species. Ultimately, this knowledge
will help better predict adaptation potential to climate
change.
Required Qualications As the recruited person will
mainly be in charge of the methylation aspects of the
project, we are primarily searching for a prospective
candidate with strong and demonstrated bioinformatics
and analytical skills to analyse genomic and epigenome
(methylation) data sets. The position is for three years
and to be lled as soon as possible. Funding comes from
a Marsden grant from the Royal Society in New Zealand
(MFP-PAF1801).The salary is established according to local University
standards.
To apply, please send a cover letter describing your re-
search interests and qualications, a complete CV and
names of three references by e- mail to Maren Wellen-
reuther (Maren.Wellenreuther@plantandfood.co.nz).

SLU Sweden
EvolutionofInsecticideResistance
Postdoc opportunity on the evolution of insecticide re-
sistance at SLU, Sweden.
We look for a highly motivated postdoc to study the
impact of host plant range on the evolution of insec-
ticide resistance in pest insects. The project period
is 2 years, funded by a taxfree scholarship from Carl
Tryggers Foundation.
Project description An increased number of phy-
tophagous pest insects have developed resistance to the
available insecticides. According to the pre-adapted hy-
pothesis, insecticide resistance readily evolves in herbiv-
orous insects since they already are adapted to tolerate
and resist chemical defences of their host plants. Recent
research has suggested that generalists are more prone
to evolve insecticide resistance and, moreover, that insec-
ticide resistance may evolve when insects expand their
host plant range. This opens up for the converse hypoth-
esis that evolution of insecticide resistance could select
for an increased degree of generalism, i.e. an extended
use of host plant species, in the insect. This project aims
to investigate the pre-adapted hypothesis in a generalist
and a specialist moth species, respectively, as well as the
converse hypotheses that insecticide resistance increases
host plant range. To study this, we will perform selec-
tion experiments combined with transcriptome analysis
and entometabolomic proling.
Organisation The project is a collaboration between Dr
Kristina Karlsson Green, Prof Peter Anderson and Dr
Amit Roy. The postdoc will be based at the department
of Plant Protection Biology at the Swedish University
of Agricultural Sciences in Alnarp. The molecular anal-
yses may be performed at the Czech University of Life
Sciences, Prague. Start date: as soon as possible.
Merits We seek a person with a PhD in Biology or
equivalent. Previous experience in working with insec-
ticide resistance, selection experiments with insects or
molecular analyses is meriting. High motivation and
enthusiasm is important, as well as ability to work both
independently and in a team. Personal skills are there-
fore an important part of the evaluation.Application and contact Please send your applica-
tion including CV, list of publications, copy of PhD
diploma, references and personal letter directly to

Start date: April 1, 2019 or earlier
Salary: 46,000 annually for two years; standard Univer-
sity of Calgary PDF benets package
Deadline to apply: Review of applications will start
asap and continue until the position is lled
Project: Sustaining Canada's natural resources and
food supply for future generations is a rapidly growing
challenge that requires an understanding of how pop-
ulations will respond and adapt to current and future
environmental stressors. Salmon produce food and recre-
ation for the people of the Pacic Northwest and are
the keystone species of coastal ecosystems and human
economies within this area. Yet, salmon populations are
under pressure and we do not understand the epigenetic
and genetic factors that inuence their odds of survival.
In particular, while hatchery programs release millions
of sh yearly, it remains unclear how many of these
released salmon survive and whether they contribute to
increasing the wild population size. The PDF will join
a unique and growing partnership between the Nitinat
River Hatchery, the Bameld Marine Sciences Centre,
Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the
Ditidaht and Huu-ay-aht First Nations to test the en-
vironmental and genomic consequences of alternative
hatchery salmon rearing practices. The PDF will work
closely with Dr. Kristi-Miller-Saunders (DFO) and Dr.
Brad Anholt (University of Victoria). Our ability to
raise thousands of Coho salmon families used in enhance-
ment programs under dierent rearing conditions is a
unique and powerful opportunity to understand how
hatchery rearing practices may impact salmon survival
and the genetics of domestication.

UHawaii FungalGenomics
Postdoc in marine fungal genomics, University of Hawaii
A postdoc position is available in the Amend Lab in the
Department of Botany at the University of Hawaii at
Manoa. The successful applicant will join a dynamic
group of researchers interested in microbial ecology and
evolution within the unique Hawaiian archipelago. The
researcher will primarily be responsible for genome se-
quencing and analysis of marine yeasts from the genus
Malassezia. This genus of Basidiomycete yeasts, re-
cently placed within its own class, is hyperdiverse and
among the most widespread and numerically dominant
fungi in the worlds oceans: found in deep-sea sedi-
ments, hydrothermal vents, on and in invertebrate hosts
and throughout pelagic water columns. Improbably,
Malassezia also dominate mammal skin on land, are
prevalent residents of terrestrial animal guts, and are
consistent, though low abundance, members of soil and
plant fungal communities. There exist excellent ge-
nomic resources for this group, and all but one of the
fteen species for which genomes are sequenced con-
tains fewer than 9 Mb and 5,000 genes, placing them
amongst the smallest free-living genomes in kingdom
fungi. Malassezia are also dikaryotic (N+N), with a
genomic signature of bipolar mating types. This and
evidence that Malassezia genomes have undergone exten-
sive rearrangements and gene loss/gain events suggests
the potential for rapid evolution.
Our main interest is to identify the mechanisms enabling
transitions from terrestrial to marine habitats, and to
infer how frequently such transitions have occurred. Be-
cause none of the marine species have been cultivated
yet, the postdoc will be responsible for developing and
implementing a single cell genomic workow targeting
habitats in which Malassezia are known to dominate.
The researcher will have access to two marine stations,
sequencing, microscopy and ow cytometry core facili-
ties as well as access to a large campus supercomputer.
The appointment is for one year. Salary is commensu-
rate with experience, and will be livable given Hawaii's
high cost of living.Start date is as soon as is feasible.
The Amend lab is strongly committed to achieving ex-
cellence through diversity. We are aware of biases, con-
scious and unconscious, in academia and in science and
we actively seek to reduce the role of these biases in
our own decisions and in those of our colleagues and
collaborators. We work together to combat prejudice
and work toward equity and inclusion, within the lab
and in the communities with whom we interact V on
campus and beyond.
Required Qualications
Successful candidates will hold a Ph.D. degree in biol-
ogy, marine biology, microbiology, genetics or another
relevant eld. Researchers must be willing to contribute
to a respectful, collegial, honest, and productive lab
environment.
Desirable Qualications
-Experience designing clade specic probes/primers
-Experience using uorescence activated cell sorting or
other ow cytometry capture techniques
-Experience assembling and annotating genomic data
-Experience analyzing genomes within a comparative

UHelsinki ExperimentalEvoDevo
Post-doc in predicting evolution:
1.Job/ project description:
The research will involve using and rening an existingJanuary 1, 2019 EvolDir 93
mathematical model of wing morphogenesis to explore
whether it can be used to predict how wing morphol-
ogy changes over generations in an articial selection
experiment. These predictions would be contrasted
with predictions stemming from a quantitative genetics
analysis of y populations.
The research will take place in the Center of Excellence
in Experimental and computational developmental biol-
ogy of the Biotechnology Institute of the University of
Helsinki, Finland.
For a full description of the project check
the modeling in part of this funded project:
http://www.biocenter.helsinki./salazar/-
SalazarCiudad research plan.pdf The job is for
1,5 years.
2. Background:
Why organisms are the way they are?
Can we understand the processes by which complex
organisms are build in each generation and how these
evolved?
The process of embryonic development is now widely ac-
knowledged to be crucial to understand evolution since
any change in the phenotype in evolution (e.g. morphol-
ogy) is rst a change in the developmental process by
which this phenotype is produced. Over the years we
have come to learn that there is a set of developmental
rules that determine which phenotypic variation can
possibly arise in populations due to genetic mutation
(the so called genotype-phenotype map). Since natural
selection can act only on existing phenotypic variation,
these rules of development have an eect on the direction
of evolutionary change.
Our group is devoted to understand these developmental
rules and how these can help to better understand the
direction of evolutionary change. The ultimate goal is
to modify evolutionary theory by considering not only
natural selection in populations but also developmen-
tal biology in populations. For that aim we combine
mathematical models of embryonic development that
relate genetic variation to morphological variation with
population models. The former models are based on
what is currently known in developmental biology.
There are two traditional approaches to study pheno-
typic evolution. One is quantitative genetics and one
is developmental evolutionary biology. The former is
based in the statistics of the association between ge-
netic relatedness and phenotypic variation between in-
dividuals in populations, the latter in the genetic and
bio-mechanical manipulation of the development of lab
individuals. While the former models trait variationwith an statistical linear approach the latter models it by
deterministic non-linear models of gene networks and tis-
sue bio-mechanics. For the most, these two approaches
are largely isolated from each other.
The current project aims to contrast and put together
these two approaches in a specic easy to study system:
the y wing. In brief, we are growing y populations
and, in each generation, we select the founders of the
next generation based on how close they resemble an
arbitrary optimal morphology in their wings (based on
the proportions between several of their traits). In each
generation also, we estimate the G matrix and the selec-
tion gradient to see how well one can predict evolution
in the next generation. The quantitative genetics predic-
tions will be contrasted with the predictions stemming
from a wing morphogenesis model that we built based
on our current understanding of wing developmental
biology (see Dev Cell. 2015 Aug 10;34(3):310-22 for
the model and for slightly similar approaches: Nature.
2013 May 16;497(7449):361-4. and Nature. 2010 Mar
25;464(7288):583-6).
Our center of excellence includes groups working in
tooth, wing, hair and mammary glands development. In
addition to evolutionary and developmental biologists
the center of excellence includes bioinformaticians, pop-
ulational and quantitative geneticists, systems biologists
and paleontologists. The group leaders of the center in-
volved in this project are Jukka Jernvall, Salazar-Ciudad
and Shimmi.
'The Academy of Finland's Centres of Excellence are the
agships of Finnish research. They are close to or at the
very cutting edge of science in their elds, carving out
new avenues for research, developing creative research
environments and training new talented researchers for
the Finnish research system.'
3. Requirements:
The applicant must hold a PhD in either evolutionary
biology, developmental biology or, preferably, in evolu-
tionary developmental biology (evo-devo). Applicants
with a PhD in theoretical or mathematical biology are
also welcome.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.
The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.

some host-parasite communities that lead to parasite
populations more poised for adaptation, versus other
communities that lead to more evolutionarily sluggish
parasites?
The successful candidate will be part of an interdisci-
plinary collaboration combining natural populations of
rodents and their bacterial parasites, microbial experi-
mental evolution, and computational models/analyses.
This position will be primarily responsible for the com-
putational components, but communication and col-
laboration with others working on all aspects of this
project will be indispensable. In addition, this position
will be responsible for mentoring undergraduate and
graduate students working on related projects. See a
more detailed abstract of the project on NSFs website:
http://bit.ly/2qe3L8y Funding is available for at least
2 years, and appointments are renewed annually based
on continued progress.
The Zaman Engineered and Experimental Evolution
(ZEEE) lab is part of the University of Michigans Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology Department as well as
the Center for the Study of Complex Systems. The
successful candidate will enjoy vibrant interdisciplinary
environments that both departments oer. More info
about the lab at https://zeeelab.com/ . Required Qual-
ications: - PhD in a eld related to computational
biology, molecular/microbiology, or ecology and evolu-tion by the start date
Desired Qualications: - Programing prociency (e.g.,
Python, C++, R) - Background in ecology and evolu-
tion, especially of microbes - Evidence of creative and
clear writing skills
How to Apply: Send a single PDF document with a
CV, a brief (paragraph or two) summary of previous
research and other relevant experiences, and the con-
tact information for 2-3 references to Luis Zaman (za-

MosquitoPopulationGenomics
Senior Postdoctoral Research Scientist in Population
Genomics University of Oxford, Big Data Institute
Salary Range: £40,792 - £48,677 Type of Appointment:
Full-time and xed-term until January 2021 Location:
Oxford, UK Application Deadline: 18 Jan 2019
We are sequencing 10,000 whole genomes per year of
Anopheles mosquitoes collected from wild populations
across Africa and Southeast Asia, as part of the Malaria
Genomic Epidemiology Network (www.malariagen.net)
and through our collaboration with the Wellcome Sanger
Institute ( https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/-
kwiatkowski-group). These data are a unique resource
for studying population biology, and for investigating
the evolution of the Anopheles mosquito species that
transmit malaria.
We are looking to recruit a senior postdoc who can lead
applied research in the areas of population genomic in-
ference and modelling. We hope to use genomic data to
address some of the open questions regarding Anophe-
les mosquito populations in Africa, including the rate,
range and spatial patterns of migration; the impact
of seasonal climate variation on population dynamics;
the impact of current mosquito control interventions in-
tended to reduce malaria transmission; and the previous
history and likely future course of insecticide resistance
adaptations.
New methods for population genomic inference and
modelling are themselves evolving rapidly, and this role
provides an opportunity to leverage the latest method-
ological advances and apply them to one of the largest
genomic datasets available for any species. The results
will be of basic scientic interest, but will also be of
relevance to public health, as many of these questions
need to be answered in order to design better strategies
for managing insecticide resistance, and to investigateoptimal strategies for the deployment of new vector
control tools such as gene drive.
This role will provide an opportunity to collaborate with

*Project description: *The process of domestication
has fascinated biologists since the early days of the
evolutionary theory. Domestication represents observ-
able evolutionary change in a relatively short time span
making it an ideal subject to study these processes. Re-
cent technological advances in archaeogenomics allow
to study such evolutionary changes through time by
obtaining genomic data from populations across time

Vienna Wolbachia-FruitFlyGenomics
A Postdoc position is being oered to study the en-
dosymbiont Wolbachia in invasive cherry fruit ies. The
project is funded for three years by the Austrian Science
Fund (FWF).
The eastern cherry fruit y Rhagoletis cingulata is an
important economic pest species infesting cherry species
in its native range in North America. It was recently
introduced to Europe where it co-infests cherries with
the native European cherry fruit y Rhagoletis cerasi.
The shared habitat of the two insect species resulted in
the horizontal transmission of a Wolbachia strain from
R. cerasi to R. cingulata. The project aims to study the
early stages of Wolbachia transmission and the spread
of the endosymbiont in nature. Moreover the project
focuses on the invasion history of the y and the po-
tential consequences of the new Wolbachia infection for
invasion success of its host. Our research objective willJanuary 1, 2019 EvolDir 99
be accomplished by whole genome sequencing of dier-
ent Wolbachia strains and by studying the spatial and
temporal distribution of the newly acquired endosym-
biont in natural populations. We will determine the
introduction routes of R. cingulata performing exten-
sive genomic characterization of native and invasive y
populations and perform crossing studies to study the
phenotypic eects of the endosymbiont.
The project will be in collaboration with Lisa Klasson
(Uppsala University, Sweden) and Je Feder (University
of Notre Dame, USA) and will be performed in the lab
of Christian Stauer (Boku, Vienna).
We are looking for an enthusiastic candidate with a
strong background in next-gen sequencing and bioinfor-
matics analysis and a strong interest in experimental
and molecular ecology. The candidate should have ex-
cellent communication skills and should be uent in
English. The working language in the laboratory is En-
glish. German skills, although helpful, are not essential.
The position is based at the University of Nat-
ural Resources and Life Sciences, Boku https://-
www.boku.ac.at/ in Vienna. Salary is according to
the standard personnel costs of the FWF https://-
www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/personnel-costs/ .
To apply, please send an application letter detailingresearch background and research interests, your CV
and the contact information of at least two references to
hannes.schuler@unibz.it. The position is available im-
mediately, but the starting date is negotiable. Review of

Trees in the Desert 2019 (http://treesinthedesert.org)
A workshop on ultra-large phylogenetic trees April 12-14,
2019 Tucson, Arizona
Phylogenetic trees with thousands of species, genes or
individuals are now being published regularly, and nu-
merous eorts around the globe are aimed at scaling this
up even further. The algorithmic challenges for assem-
bling, evaluating, and applying these large trees remain
formidable, however, with plenty of room for novel ap-
proaches. We invite graduate students in phylogenetic
biology, bioinformatics, mathematics and computer sci-
ence to join us in a three-day workshop on this topic,
supported by a grant from the U.S. National Science
Foundation. The goal is to communicate aspects of
known approaches to the problem, brainstorm collec-
tively about new ideas, and get our hands dirty with
exemplar data sets. The ideal student for this will
be a mid- to-late Ph.D. student in one of these elds,
with some experience in phylogenetic toolkits, program-
ming and bioinformatics infrastructure (e.g., scripting
languages, UNIX shell, etc.). Funds are available to
support travel, lodging and meals for students.
Topics will likely include constructing large trees, eval-
uating their robustness and reliability, and integrating
them with various post-phylogenetic analyses. Specic
topics will be driven by interests and experience of the
participants but may include scalability of conventional
tree building methods, alignment-free tree construction,
model-selection in large trees, coalescent and gene-tree
approaches, missing data and terraces, assembling con-
dence sets of trees for subsequent study, and scalable
inference of tree annotations such as divergence times,
ancestral states, etc. Aside from short talks the rst
day, the format will be almost entirely \hands-on", fo-
cusing on developing and testing new ideas and pushing
existing ones to their feasibility limits.
The workshop will be held at the University of Arizona's
Biosphere 2 (http://biosphere2.org) facility, located in
the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains about 30miles north of Tucson. Tucson proper is anked on its
east and west sides by Saguaro National Park, founded
as a reserve for the saguaro cactus that is so emblematic
of the Sonoran Desert. April is an exceptional time to
visit southern Arizona, with the spring desert bloom
well underway, sunny warm days and cool nights. Bio-
sphere 2 is located in mesquite grassland not far from
trailheads for the Arizona Trail and other hikes into the
Catalina Mountains.

Berlin PopulationGenomics
May13-17
Dear all,
happy to inform you that we will run the 4th edition
of our Workshop \Introductory Population Genomics:
From Data to Inference" in Berlin.
When: 13-17 May 2019
Instructors:
Dr. Martin Taylor( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
instructors/t9/ ) (University of East Anglia, UK)
Dr. Lewis Spurgin (University of East Anglia, UK)
Website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course392/ Course Overview
Next generation sequencing has revolutionized evolu-
tionary biology allowing unprecedented resolution and
insight into evolutionary questions that appeared in-
tractable only a few years ago. The course will cover
the basics of population genomic analysis from SNP
data onwards and will cover the key analyses that may
be required to successfully analyze a population ge-
netic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-
nomic analysis and be competent in population genomic
analysis.
Targeted audience & ASSUMED BACKGROUND
This workshop is aimed at postgraduate students and
early career researchers who are interested in using pop-
ulation genomic tools in their research. No previous
experience of bioinformatics is required, but an under-
pinning in evolutionary biology and basic population
genetics concepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
and FST are desirable. The course will use a range of
software including the Linux operating system and R.
TEACHING FORMATThe workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists of
a combination of lectures and practical exercises, with
breaks at the organisers discretion. There will also be
time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.

Berlin SingleCellRNAseq
Feb25-Mar1
Dear all,
there are still a few spots available for our course \Anal-
ysis of single cell RNA-seq data" from the 25th February
to 1st March 2019 in Berlin.
Course website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course18/ INSTRUCTORS:
Dr. Ayshwarya Subramanian (Broad Institute of MIT
and Harvard)
Dr. Dana Silverbush (Broad Institute of MIT and Har-
vard)
Dr. Ehsan Habibi (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard)
Course overview
In recent years single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has
become widely used for transcriptome analysis in many
areas of biology. In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-
seq provides quantitative measurements of the expres-
sion of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze
scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some
of the underlying assumptions for the methods devel-
oped for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid.January 1, 2019 EvolDir 105
In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq
processing, starting from the raw reads coming o the
sequencer. The course includes common analysis strate-
gies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss
the central biological questions that can be addressed
using scRNA-seq.
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The
material is suitable both for experimentalists who want
to learn more about data-analysis as well as computa-
tional biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq
methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can
be applied to any experimental protocol or biological
system.
The requirements for this course are:
i- Working knowledge of unix (managing les, running
programs)
ii- Programming experience in R (writing a function,
basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages).
iii- Bioconductor experience is a plus.
iv- Familiarity with NGS data and its analyses (using
alignment and quantication tools for bulk sequencing
data)
Teaching Format
The course will be delivered over the course of ve days.
Each day will include a lecture and laboratory compo-
nent. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion
and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical
hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will
be done using a combination of tools installed on the
attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed
via web browser.

BodegaBay AppliedPhylogenetics
May25-Jun2
[LAST CALL: APPLICATIONS DUE FRIDAY] UC
Davis WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGENETICS
at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, California
May 25-June 2, 2019
Sponsored by the University of California, Davis and
Bodega Marine Laboratory
website: http://treethinkers.org/ Introduction Phyloge-
netic methods have revolutionized modern systematics
and become indispensable tools in evolution, ecology
and comparative biology, playing an increasingly impor-
tant role in analyses of biological data at all levels of
organization ranging from molecules to ecological com-
munities. The estimation of phylogenetic trees is now a
formalized statistical problem with general agreement
on the central issues and questions. A nearly standard
set of topics is now taught as part of the curriculum
at many colleges and universities. On the other hand,
application of phylogenetic methods to novel problems
outside systematics is an area of special excitement, in-
novation, and controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
This Spring, for the eighteenth year, we will teach a
workshop for graduate students interested in applying
phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The
8-day course is an intensive exploration of problems to
which modern phylogenetic approaches are being applied
and the most current statistical tools and methods that
are used to solve those problems. We cover a wide range
of topics in comparative statistical phylogenetics. The
course starts with recent advances in phylogenetic infer-
ence, and then focuses on methods for making inferences
from phylogenies.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Laboratory
on the beautiful Northern California coast, which has
on-site housing. The course format will involve equal
parts of lecture and hands-on software training with
an emphasis on performing analyses using RevBayes:
http://revbayes.github.io, with instruction in other in-
ference software (MrBayes, BEAST, etc.) based on
student interest. One afternoon during the week will be
left free for eld trips to local natural areas.106 EvolDir January 1, 2019
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesian
inference of phylogeny * Model specication: model se-
lection, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing MCMC
performance * Divergence-time estimation: relaxed
clocks, fossil calibration * Species-tree estimation and
species delimitation * Character evolution: discrete-
and continuous-trait evolution * Lineage diversication:
detecting rate shifts, testing key-innovation hypotheses
Instructor Team * Cecile Ane (UW, Madison) * Sebas-
tian Hohna (LMU, Munich) * John Huelsenbeck (UC,
Berkeley) * Michael Landis (Washington University) *
Mike May (UC, Berkeley) * Brian Moore (UC, Davis) *
Bruce Rannala (UC, Davis) * Bob Thomson (U Hawaii,
Manoa) * Peter Wainwright (UC, Davis)
Prerequisites Available housing limits course enrollment
to~30 students. Preference is given to doctoral candi-
dates who are in the early to middle stages of their thesis
research, and who have completed sucient prerequisites
(through previous coursework or research experience)
to provide some familiarity with phylogenetic methods.
Unfortunately, because of limits on class size, postdocs
and faculty are generally discouraged from applying.
Admission and Fees Students will be admitted based on
academic qualications and appropriateness of research
interests. The course fee is $850. This includes room
and board at BML for duration of the course (arriving
on Saturday, May 25; departing on Sunday, June 2) and
return transportation from Davis to the Bodega Marine
Labs.

Apr1-5
Dear colleagues,Registration is open for the Trans-
mitting Science course: AN INTRODUCTION TO
METAGENOMICS AND METABARCODING. End
of early bird: December 31st.Dates: April 1st-5th,
2019.Place: Heraklion (Crete, Greece).Instructor:
Dr. M. Lisandra Zepeda-Mendoza (Chr. Hansen
&#8211; Bacterial Physiology &#38; Improvement,
Denmark).Metagenomics is the study of the collection
of genomes in an environment. Environments as diverse
as Antarctic lakes, hot springs, or the human gut can be
biologically characterized by extracting and sequencing
DNA from samples taken from them. A characteristic
of many of these samples is their complexity, posing
diculties to their analysis and characterization.
However, metagenomics allows the taxonomic and
functional characterization of samples. These two
kinds of characterizations also enable the comparison
of dierent habitats for biodiversity assessment.In this
course, students will be introduced to the command
line environment used to analyze high-throughput
sequencing data (HTS). The initial cleaning steps
that must be performed on every HTS dataset will
be described and we will use the processed data for
proper functional and taxonomical characterization
of a metagenomic dataset. We will use methods such
as mapping to whole genome databases, de novo
assembly, gene annotation, building of non-redundant
gene catalogue, and metagenomic species concept
identication. Due to the wide usage of metabarcoding
for the taxonomic characterization of an environment,
we will also discuss amplicon sequencing strategies and
data analysis. The course will be based on both theory
and hands-on exercises.More information: http://-

Workshop: Molecular Evolution: Patterns and Causes
Time: 20.-22.2.2019 Place: Konnevesi Research Station
of the University of Jyv ~A^Askyl ~A^A, Konnevesi, Finland
Conrmed invited speakers: Prof. Adam Eyre-Walker
(Sussex), Prof. Sylvain Glemin (Montpellier), Prof.
Richard Goldstein (University College London), Prof.
Ville Mustonen (Helsinki), Prof. Andreas Wagner
(Zurich) and Dr. Jessica Abbott (Lund).

Heikki Helanter ~A^A (Oulu) and Prof. Hannu
Yl~A^A(Jyv ~A^Askyl ~A^A)
The rate of molecular evolution varies at several levels
of biological organization, e.g. among sites, among pro-
teins, among chromosomes, and among lineages. The
forces underlying this variation include mutation rate
and the strength of natural selection, which are in turn
aected by e.g. population size, linkage, generation time,
gene function, gene expression, pleiotropy, and biophys-
ical properties of gene products (e.g. proteins). While
there is a reasonable understanding of these patterns
and forces, many questions remain, and a holistic view
of molecular evolution is still somewhat underdeveloped.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together students
and researchers from all career stages to discuss recent
ndings in the eld of molecular evolution, and to foster
new research and collaborations. The estimated number
of participants is 50.
The workshop starts on Wednesday, Feb 20th at 12:45,
but it is possible to arrive already on Tuesday, Feb 19th.
On Tuesday evening, there will be dinner and sauna
provided. The workshop ends on Friday, Feb 22nd at
16:00.

Portugal FunctionalMorphology
Feb27-Mar1
Functional morphology aims to link up variation in phe-
notype to variation in musculo-skeletal function. It is
tightly related to ecomorphology which tries to under-
stand the association between variation in ecology and
the phenotype of an organism. To understand the re-
lationships between form and function it is essential to
understand the structure of the basic elements that make110 EvolDir January 1, 2019
up the vertebrate body: bone and muscle. Based on the
understanding of how these tissues work one can then
apply the principles of biomechanics (statics and/or
dynamics) to provide 1) a priori testable predictions
about the relationship between phenotype and function,
and 2) build simple biomechanical models that allow
one to vary the input parameters to evaluate how these
impact the output of the system. Often these types of
analyses go hand-in-hand with analyses of movements
and the forces that allow these movements. This is
tightly linked to measurements of performance used in
an ecomorphological context.
The objectives of this short course are to provide stu-
dents the basic principles of functional morphology,
biomechanics and movement analyses that may allow
them to use these to study whole-animal performance
in an ecological and evolutionary context.

Course description
Study methods in population genomics have been pro-
foundly reshaped in the last few years, fostered by a
rapid growth of DNA sequence production and sharing.
This unprecedented opportunity guided major steps
forward in the eld and calls for new approaches and
computational skills to become routine in evolutionary
genomics laboratories.
The objectives of this EMBO Practical Course are to
give an overview of the state of the art methods in popu-
lation genomics, including programming, and to enable
participants to run their project's analyses with high con-
dence. The course combines lectures from outstanding
experienced population geneticists with practice, both
at individual and group level. All conceptual innovation
will be presented in lectures and applied in practice.
This EMBO Practical Course will cover coalescent, ge-
netic diversity, natural selection, population demogra-
phy in time and space, admixture, genetic clustering,
and genome-wide association studies. Population ge-
netics topics will be complemented by computational
ones such as Python programming and machine learning
techniques.
This course aims at evolutionary biologists who already
have basic bioinformatics skills. Ph.D. students and
Postdoc researchers will benet the most out of this
course, but applications from all candidates will be eval-
uated in their context.

Introduction to the concepts and methods of networks
in evolutionary studies (sequence similarity networks,
genome networks and multipartite graphs)
This free summer school will be held in Rosco, France,
between June 23rd 2019 (date of arrival) and June 29th
(date of departure).
This school is designed in priority for biologists and bio-
informaticians (completing a PhD degree or currently
post-doctoral fellows, as well as researchers), who wish
to learn the bases of network analyses.
The main notions (regarding various types of networks,
the relevance of their analyses, and some bases in graph
theory) will be introduced by short theoretical classes,
followed by practical case-studies, introducing the basics
in programming required to run such network analyses
as well as to use the existing software/tools. Our goal
is that, by the end of this summer school, all applicants
will be qualied to perform network analyses of their
own datasets.
More precisely, we will focus on the following concepts
and methods:
- Introgressive evolution and large-scale diversity studies.
- Construction and analysis of sequence similarity net-
works (construction and sorting of connected compo-
nents, denition of gene families, search for composite
genes, implementation of centrality measures)
- Construction and analysis of genome networks (con-
struction of weighted genome networks, implementation
of their diameter, shortest paths, analyses of labeled
nodes, etc.)
- Construction and analysis of gene-genome bipartite
graphs (detection of connected components, and their
articulation points, and twins)
In addition, 9 conferences on networks and evolution will
be delivered by leading European and North American
scientists during this school.
Conrmed speakers (so far) :
Dr. Eric Bapteste (UPMC, France): Introduction to
sequence similarity networks112 EvolDir January 1, 2019
Pr. Robert Beiko (Dalhousie University, Canada) : In-
troduction to phylogenetic networks
Pr. Debashish Bhattacharya (U. Rutgers, USA): Retic-
ulate evolution in eukaryotes
Pr. Eugene Koonin (NCBI, USA) : Viruses and net-
works
Dr. Damien Eveillard (U. Nantes, France): Co-
occurrence networks and the evolution of geochemical
cycles in the environment
Pr. Marc-Andr e S elosse (MNHN, France): The living
world as a network
This summer school is funded by ERC grant (FP7/2007-
2013 Grant Agreement # 615274). Hence, registration
is free, housing and food (breakfast, lunch) are also fully
covered. Applicants will only need to fund their travel
to Rosco and their evening dinners.
10 places only are available, with a mandatory require-
ment: applicants must show basic computer skills (i.e.
to be familiar with Linux environment and with at least
one programming language, preferably Python).
Applications are to be submitted asap, and no later
than February 15th 2019, by email to :
eric.bapteste@upmc.fr , and contain a brief letter de-
scribing why this class will be of signicant interest for
the applicant and his/her future studies.
Applicants will be selected based on their motivation,
and their resume, including the names of two scientic
referees for PhD and postdoctoral fellows.
We are excited to meet you soon in Rosco.

Course Overview: With the increasing availability of
various types of genetic and genomic data, population
genetics and molecular ecology are becoming largely
data driven sciences. Understanding the evolutionary,
demographic, and ecological underpinning the genetic
makeup of natural populations now relies on a com-
bination of exploratory approaches and models. This
course will provide an in-depth introduction to these
techniques, with a strong emphasis on reproducibility
though the use of modern analytic practices and tools.
After an introduction to phylogenetic reconstruction, the
course will cover a number of multivariate approaches
for the analysis of genetic patterns, including super-
vised and unsupervised factorial methods, clustering
approaches, and advanced methods for describing popu-
lation diversity and revealing spatial genetic patterns.
The approaches introduced will be applicable to most
genetic data, including markers such as microsatellites,
SNPs, or AFLP, as well as nucleotide and amino-acid114 EvolDir January 1, 2019

icated to a type of problem and methods, followed by
an introduction to a specic technique for reproducible
data analysis; afternoon will be devoted to hands on
praticals. The last day will be devoted to open prob-
lems, where participants will be able to analyse their
own data.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.116 EvolDir January 1, 2019
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
