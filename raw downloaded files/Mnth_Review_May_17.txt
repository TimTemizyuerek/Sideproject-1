Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the 3rd Probabilistic Mod-
eling in Genomics Conference (ProbGen17), that will be
held at Aarhus University, Denmark, from 18-20 Sept
2017.
The conference will cover probabilistic models, algo-
rithms, and statistical methods across a broad range
of applications in genetics and genomics. We invite
abstract submissions on a range of topics including Pop-ulation Genetics, Functional Genomics, Systems and
Structural Biology, Methods for Genome-wide Associa-
tion Studies, Causal inference in genetic studies, Assem-
bly and Variant Identication, Phylogenetics, Natural
Selection and Quantitative Genetics.
Alongside invited speakers, oral presentations will be
selected from submitted abstracts. We particularly en-
courage abstract submissions from junior investigators,
including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.
Probgen was held previously in Cold Spring Harbor
(2015), and Oxford (2016). It evolved from the suc-
cess of previous similarly-themed workshops held at
the HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus (2013) and
Merton College, Oxford (2014).
The conference talks and poster sessions will be held
at the new Moesgaard Museum for archaeology andApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 3
ethnography (MOMU) situated just 5 km out of Aarhus.
Aarhus is most easily accessible from either Aarhus
(AAR) or Billund (BLL) Airport that serves most ma-
jor European cities.
The meeting will begin with an informal mixer on
the evening of Sunday 17 September 2017 at Hotel
Comwell [http://www.comwellaarhus.dk/] in central
Aarhus. Talks will take place from Monday 18 Septem-
ber until lunchtime on Wednesday 20 September.
Registration will open soon. We have provisional ca-
pacity for ~200 participants; due to space limitations,
registration will proceed on a rst-come-rst-served ba-
sis.
Important deadline: The early bird registration and
abstract submission deadline is June 10th, 2017.

Asilomar ASN Jan5-9 SympCall
The American Society of Naturalists
Call for Symposia
ASN meeting at Asilomar, California
5-9 Jan 2018
The American Society of Naturalists invites sympo-
sium proposals for their stand-alone meeting, to be held
at Asilomar in Monterey, California 5-9 January 2018.
Two symposia will be chosen for this meeting, to run
on separate days, in addition to a special symposium
celebrating the 150th anniversary of the rst publication
of the American Naturalist. Proposals for the special
anniversary symposium are being solicited separately.
Symposium topics should support the Society's goal
to advance the conceptual unication of the biologicalsciences and further knowledge in evolution, ecology,
behavior and organismal biology. Proposals are encour-
aged on topics that are synthetic, interdisciplinary or
that address important emerging issues in evolution,
ecology and behavior.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (one page); (3) a tentative list of
speakers, including institutional aliations; (4) a jus-
tication for the symposium explaining why the topic
and speakers are appropriate for an ASN meeting, keep-
ing in mind the broader goals of the society ( http://-
www.amnat.org/about/about-the-society.html); and (5)
a statement that all proposed invited speakers have
agreed to participate. Organizers should plan the sym-
posia to run from approximately 1:30-5:30, and can
divide this time amongst speakers as they wish, reserv-
ing time for a coee break.
Proposals must be submitted by midnight Eastern
Standard Time on March 31, 2017 by email (emi-
lies@umn.edu) as a single pdf attachment, under subject
heading: ASN Asilomar Symposium Proposal. Propos-
als that include women, young investigators and in-
dividuals from underrepresented groups are especially
encouraged.
Please note that the society does not have the funds to
pay for travel or lodging expenses of the chosen speak-
ers. But, in exceptional circumstances we may consider
requests to waive conference registration costs for ju-
nior participants in symposia. Regardless, there may be
opportunities to seek external symposium funding.
The Society's selection committee will evaluate propos-
als based on the likelihood of attracting a substantial
audience, the signicance and timeliness of the topic,
and on it being substantively dierent from recent sym-
posia hosted by the Society. All applicants will be
notied of the decision by late April 2017.

Jan5-9 RequestProposals
Tocelebrate the 150th Anniversary of the rst publica-
tion of The American Naturalist, there will be a special
symposium at the stand-alone meeting of the American
Society of Naturalists (January 5 - 9, 2018, Asilomar
CA, USA). The symposium is titled \On the shoulders
of giants: the future of The American Naturalist". The
goal of the symposium will be to show how major ad-
vances published in the journal's history have laid the
foundation for exciting new directions in evolutionary
ecology and related elds. There will be time for six
30-minute talks, each highlighting a dierent concept
from a classic American Naturalist paper, and where
those ideas are headed next. We want the talks to place
the original paper into its historic context, trace the sub-
sequent development of the idea, and (crucially) show
how the classic ideas connect to today's cutting-edge
research. Weare requesting proposals for talks. Each
proposal should be no more than 250 words. Proposals
should:
1) Identify what inuential paper(s) from The American
Naturalist's past will be the starting point of the talk.
2) Briey explain how that past paper inuenced the
direction of the eld generally and the speaker's career
in particular.
3) Indicate how the speaker is using / developing /
changing that classic paper's ideas in their own current
and future work. Inaddition to the 250 word limit, one
gure and up to 5 references are allowed.
Talkproposals should be sent to Daniel Bolnick (danbol-
nick@austin.utexas.edu) by May 1. We expect to notify
chosen speakers by June 1.
Weencourage junior researchers (post-docs, early-career
faculty) to apply, and individuals from often under-
represented groups.
Thesociety does not have the funds to pay for travel
or lodging expenses of the chosen speakers. But in ex-
ceptional circumstances ASM may consider appeals to
waive conference registration fees for junior presenters
who lack other means to cover conference costs.
Inaddition to this symposium, the American Society
of Naturalists is separately seeking proposals for topics
and speakers for two other organized symposia at the2018 Asilomar meeting (contact Emilie Snell-Rood for
details, emilies@umn.edu).

Immigrants to the rescue! How can immigration help
save threatened wildlife populations?
Speakers: Richard Frankham; Mike Bruford; Jane Reid
Threatened species have invariably small and frequently
isolated populations, and are thus characterized by in-
creased inbreeding and depleted genetic variation. In-
creased inbreeding could lead to a reduction in reproduc-
tion and survival (inbreeding depression), which causes
an immediate risk of extinction. Depleted genetic varia-
tion could compromise the ability of a species to adapt
to an ever-changing environment, threatening its long-
term survival. How to mitigate these adverse eects of
small populations, and maintain a threatened species
for short- and long-term survival, is a major task for
conservation science. Supplementing genetically impov-
erished populations with external unrelated individuals
(immigrants) can be a valuable strategy to counteract
the negative eects of isolation. This 'genetic rescue'
eect occurs because the addition of unrelated genomes
increases diversity in the recipient population, reducing
inbreeding and inbreeding depression. Genetic rescue
has the added benet of increasing population size and
larger populations are less vulnerable to random events,
such as a natural disaster or disease outbreak. Despite
the potential benets of genetic rescue for the manage-
ment of threatened species, there have been fewer than
twenty published studies of genetic rescue/restoration
for conservation purposes. Why has there been such a
low uptake?
The speakers will describe the hurdles, and illustrate
how genetic rescue can be expedited through rein-
troduction and conservation programmes. Free and

malacologists-50th-annual-meeting-tickets-28744283927Molluscs and Climate Change 20 June 2017 What are
the eects of climate change on molluscs and the evi-
dence molluscs give us regarding climate change? Ap-
propriate topics for presentations include (but are not
limited to) anthropogenic and naturally-caused changes,
range changes or contractions because of long term
ocean temperature changes or El Ni no/La Ni na condi-
tions, inuence of ocean acidication, global or local
extinctions, invasions or introductions, and evidence
from fossil/subfossil and indigenous midden sites.
Current Research in Fossil Mollusca 21 June 2017 The
rich fossil record of molluscs lends itself to studies and
interpretation of biostratigraphy, systematics, evolution,
and paleoecology. We invite presentations concerning
any fossil molluscan taxa with a local, regional, or world-
wide focus. We also invite presentations about the work
of museums in cataloging and preserving fossil molluscs.
Terrestrial Molluscs 22 June 2017 Terrestrial snails and
slugs comprise nearly one third of known molluscs at
estimates of 40,000 species. Much of this fauna, espe-
cially in Western North America, is poorly documented
and/or under-studied. This symposium will highlight
native and introduced land snails and slugs and current
research that is elucidating aspects of their morphology,
behavior, distribution, evolution, and conservation.
General Session 20, 21, 22 June 2017 Presentations con-
cerning almost any aspect of molluscan biology, archeol-
ogy, and anthropology are welcome.
We hope to see you in Los Angeles!

Dear Community
An International Mimulus meeting will be held June
23rd, just prior to the Evolution Meeting in Portland,
OR. The meeting will be located at Portland State Uni-
versity. Thanks to Matt Streisfeld and Mitch Cruzan
for securing a room for us!!!!
For details of the meeting, please see the website.
http://mimulusmeeting2017.wordpress.com/ As our
community continues to grow, we need to adjust the

like previous meetings, we will instead have presenters
that will summarize advances in Mimulus research over
the last few years. We will also focus the afternoon part
of the meeting on community building and organization.
We will send out more details soon on how this will all
work, but community input will be crucial for success.
So that we can send you updates, we encourage regis-
tration for meeting ASAP, even if you are not sure ifyou can come:

Dear All,
We are convening a topical session entitled \Biodiver-
sity dynamics in the face of environmental change: In-
tegrating paleontological and neontological approaches
to macroevolution" at the 2017 Geological Society of
America conference. The conference will be held 22-
25 October in Seattle, Washington. Our session (T51)
will focus on how environmental changes have shaped
Earth's biodiversity through geologic time and how these
macroevolutionary relationships might be used to un-
derstand the responses of extant species to current and
projected environmental conditions. Invited speakers in-
clude Samantha Price (University of California, Davis),Andy Purvis (Natural History Museum London), and
Jens-Christian Svenning (Aarhus University).
If you have a current project that ts the scope of our
session we hope that you will consider submitting an
abstract for consideration. Abstract submission will be
open around April 1st, 2017 and close on August 1. We
are keenly interested in putting together a slate of talks
that span a diversity of disciplinary approaches and in-
cluding presenters from neontological backgrounds who
are interested in incorporating paleontological perspec-
tives into their research. For more information about the
conference: https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Events/-

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to con-
tact us and if you know others who might be interested
please consider forwarding this announcement to them.

Yosemite Symbiosis May5-7
EarlyRegistrationDue
Dear Colleagues,
The Seventh annual Yosemite Symbiosis Workshop will
take place on May 5th-7th, 2017 at the Sierra Nevada
Research Institute, Yosemite National Park. This has
become a great venue for a diversity of symbiosis re-
searchers. We hope to continue to attract a diverse
group in 2017!
Keynote speaker 2017: Dr. Corrie Moreau from the
Field Museum of Natural History.
Information about our meeting:
Why: Our continuing goal is to better integrate theApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 19
broad groups of scientists that focus on symbiosis re-
search. Yosemite serves as an ideal site as it is both
beautiful and secluded. This will be our 7th annual
meeting and we have been consistently attracting scien-
tists from all over the country and overseas.
Who: The meeting is small by design ( ~50 participants)
and we seek to focus on scientists interested in cooper-
ation, mutualism, and symbiosis. In the past we have
covered a range of symbiosis topics from ecology and
evolution to molecular mechanisms in dierent model
and non-model systems. We would like to make room
for a diverse group of people so we will initially accept
up to 3 lab members per group (including the PI) on a
rst come rst served basis.
When: The talks and formal meeting will be held May 6-
7, 2017, though we make accommodation arrangements
available for attendees to arrive on Friday the 5th to
provide opportunities to enjoy the park. Since time at
the conference is limited, we ask attendees to submit an
abstract and a preference (talk versus poster). Priority
will be given to those presenting.
Abstract and early bird registration are due on March
6th, 2017.
Where: SNRS has a set of cabins in Wawona and all
within a short walk of the conference room.
Costs: See details in the registration page. We will only
be able to accept credit card payments this year. Your
registration is not activated until you have completed
the payment process. NOTE that the payment link is

PhD position in computational evolutionary genomics
The position is oered within the International Max
Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Evolutionary Bi-
ology
Application deadline is April 23, 2017.
Research topic: Evolutionary metagenomics of
foraminifera residing in oxygen minimum zones
Benthic foraminifera are unicellular eukaryotes populat-
ing sediments of aquatic environments. Several species
were shown to perform complete denitrication, a rare
metabolic pathway foraminiferal denitrication pathway
is yet unknown and a prokaryotic contribution has been
suggested. Our current research comprises the analysis
of metagenomes sequenced from foraminifera sampled
in a hypoxic environment in Gullmarfjord (Sweden).
Our results indicate that denitrication is performed,
at least in part, by foraminifera-encoded proteins. This
constitutes evidence for a rare eukaryotic pathway for
nitrite resporation. The PhD candidate will take part
in analyzing foraminifera metagenomes sampled in the
Peruvian oxygen minimum zone with a focus on evolu-
tion of the denitrication pathway. The project requiresbackground in molecular evolution and programming
skills.

LausanneU AntNetworksDisease
PhD position at Lausanne University
I am looking to recruit a highly motivated PhD student
to work on disease transmission in ant social networks
at the Department of Ecology and Evolution (DEE) of
Lausanne University, Switzerland. The position is fully
funded for three years and starts in August 2017.
The successful candidate will work with a novel system,
the queenless clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi (formerly:
Cerapachys biroi), to investigate the properties of social
groups that increase resistance to pathogens (fungi, ne-
matodes). The unusual biology of this species allows us
to precisely control and replicate aspects of colony com-
position (e.g. size, genetic and demographic structure)
that are thought to modulate interaction network struc-
ture, and therefore, disease spread. The student will use
newly developed techniques for automated behavioral
tracking in combination with experimental infections
and/or molecular methods (RNAseq/qPCR) to study
how ant colonies of dierent composition regulate be-
havior and immune function at the individual and group
levels, and how this aects disease spread. Within this
framework, the student will also be encouraged to de-
velop her/his own research questions.
Candidates should have a Master's degree (or equiva-
lent) and a background in evolution/ecology, behavior,
epidemiology, systems biology or other relevant eld.
Motivation, curiosity, and an ability to work indepen-
dently are essential. Experience working with social
insects, programming, or standard wet-lab techniques
would be advantageous but are not necessary. The work-
ing language of the group is English; prociency with
French is helpful but not required.
The successful applicant will join an international, in-
teractive department with 20 groups working on a wide
range of topics in evolution and ecology, including other
labs working on social insects. Lausanne is a small
but vibrant city located on the shore of Lake Geneva,
less than one hour from the Alps. There are large stu-
dent and international communities and the city is well
connected to all major European cities.
To apply, please send a CV, a short ( <1 page)
cover letter describing your background and interests,
and the name and contact information of 2-3 persons
willing to provide recommendations to Yuko Ulrich(yuko.ulrich@gmail.com) by the end of March. Informal
inquiries are also welcome.

A fully funded PhD studentship is currently available at
Queen Mary University of London on ash genomics in
an evolutionary context. The deadline for application
to these studentships is Friday, March 31, 2017.
see: http://www.ashgenome.org/studentships Further
details are as follows:
The genomic basis of disease resistance in plants - inte-
grating within and among species data
Supervised by Dr Richard Buggs and Prof. Richard
Nichols
Project Description
Ash dieback, caused by the fungal pathogen Hymenoscy-
phus fraxineus, is threatening populations of ash trees
throughout Europe. This has sparked o an interna-
tional research eort to develop ash trees with low sus-
ceptibility to the fungus. This PhD studentship, funded
by Defra, provides an outstanding opportunity for a
student with a strong background in genetics, bioin-
formatics or statistics to contribute to this eort, and
develop methods that will be applicable to other plant-
pathogen systems.
The PhD student will be based in the lab of Dr Richard
Buggs, working with other students and postdocs on
ash genomics in relation to ash dieback. This lab re-
cently published a paper in Nature on the genome of
the European ash tree, and its diversity in Europe. The
lab has strong collaborations with many other organi-
sations working on the same problem, including Forest
Research, Teagasc, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Uni-24 EvolDir April 1, 2017
verity of Copenhagen and Earlham Institute. We are
currently sequencing and assembling the genomes of 30
ash worldwide species and testing them for resistance
to ash dieback (see http://www.ashgenome.org). We
are also analysing mass screening trials of European ash
(Fraxinus excelsior) set up by Forest Research, where
tens of thousands of trees from dierent locations in the
UK are bing exposed to ash dieback infection in eld
trials in the south of England.
The student will be co-supervised by Prof. Richard
Nichols, who has a long track record of research and
novel statistical method development in population ge-
netics. The student will conduct data analyses and
develop methods aiming to uncover the genomic basis
of tree susceptibility to pests or pathogens. He/she will
analyse genomic data from within and between tree
species, and develop new methods of analysis and data
integration. The main datasets analysed will be for
the genus Fraxinus but the methods developed will be
applicable to a wide range of systems where the genomic
basis of traits is sought.
The main criterion by which a student will be selected
is scientic excellence. There is considerable scope for
the project to be tailored to the skills and interests of
the student, tting with the broad research programme
on ash dieback.
Funding Notes
This studentship is funded by the UK Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Aairs. The award covers
Home/EU tuition fees and a tax free annual stipend at
Research Councils UK rates (pounds 16,296 in 2016/17).

Richard Buggs <r.buggs@qmul.ac.uk >MacquarieU BehaviouralEvolution
4 PhD positions in Behavioural and Physiological Ecol-
ogy
at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia We are
pleased to announce multiple opportunities available
for a start from mid to late 2017
1: Adapting to a foreign climate: the reproductive ecol-
ogy of the house sparrow in Australia The house sparrow
(Passer domesticus) was introduced into Australia in the
1860's and has since become well established across a
broad range of climates in both countries. This project
will take advantage of this 'experimental' introduction
to focus on behavioural and physiological adaptations
to dierent climates through a eld-based comparative
approach. This research will complement our existing
work on related questions in endemic Australian species
and will provide insight into the capacity of avian species
to adapt to changing climates. This project will involve
periods of eld-work in Broken Hill, Armidale and Ho-
bart in Australia, along with a range of behavioural,
molecular and physiological assays. The project will
involve collaboration with other groups in Australia and
the US.
2: The challenge of growing in a hot climate (in the
zebra nch) In recent years we have characterised the
very hot conditions in which zebra nches are raised
(with nests often reaching temperatures over 40 degrees
Celsius, as well as identifying adverse eects of these
conditions on embryonic development, ospring growth,
and adult sperm. This project is supported by an ARC
funded project and will investigate the adaptations that
this iconic and well-studied species has to deal with the
extreme climate in which it lives. The project will take
a variety of approaches including behavioural work, and
assays of metabolism and physiology, and combine eld-
work and laboratory work. The project will be run in
collaboration with Dr Christine Cooper (Curtin Univer-
sity, Western Australia), Prof. Pierre Deviche (Arizona
State University, US), and Prof. Pat Monaghan (Glas-
gow, UK).
3: Social structuring and life-history in free-ranging
domestic sheep In this project we will examine the im-
portance of social structure and collective intelligence
to life-history trade-os and productivity in domestic
sheep in the rangelands of Australia. The project will
use tools from social network theory and spatial ecologyApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 25
to characterise individual and group behaviour and inves-
tigate their eect on individual quality and productivity
(lambs and wool) in this challenging, but economically
important part of Australia. The project will be based
at Fowlers Gap (near Broken Hill in the arid zone) and
require eld work and well-developed analytical skills.
This work will be run in collaboration with partners in
the pastoral industry and be jointly supervised by Dr
Stephan Leu (also at Macquarie University).
4: Parasite transmission dynamics in an Australian
lizard This project will investigate the relationship be-
tween host spatial and social behaviour and bacterial
transmission. It combines social network theory, spatial
ecology and wildlife epidemiology to determine how dif-
ferent bacterial strains are transmitted through the pop-
ulation and how individual behaviour and consequently
population social structure changes as a function of in-
fection status. The project combines the analysis of
a very comprehensive (already collected) dataset with
scope for the student to develop his/her own ideas and
conduct eldwork. The student should be interested in
social networks and disease modelling and have strong
analytical skills. This project will be jointly supervised
by Dr Stephan Leu and A/Prof Martin Whiting (both
at Macquarie University). We also have strong relation-
ships with disease modelling colleagues in the US.
Application The Department of Biological Sciences at
Macquarie University is a vibrant environment which
oers excellent support to postgraduate students. A
Macquarie University Excellence in Research Scholar-
ship has already been assigned to one of these projects,
but there are other scholarship opportunities available
to suitably competitive candidates. International candi-
dates are welcome to apply for any of the projects listed
above.
The 2014 MQRES full-time stipend rate is $26,682 pa
tax exempt for 3 years (indexed annually). In addition
to external grant support for projects, there is additional
internal funding (up to $17,000) available to cover di-
rect research expenses and conference travel. Applicants
should ideally have a research-based MSc in a related
discipline (with a minimum 50% research component),
and additional relevant research experience, qualica-
tions, and details of awards or prizes. For projects 1,
2, and 4 an ability to work in remote and harsh condi-
tions as well as experience in capturing and handling
animals is desirable. A driving licence is required for all
projects. Applications should include 1) your CV, 2) a
brief statement of your reasons for applying (max. 500
words) and the project you are applying

NewZealand FishSex
Project opportunity BSc (Hons) or Masters
Investigating the molecular basis of sex in snapper
Maren Wellenreuther (Plant and Food Research, Nelson,
New Zealand) and Neil Gemmell (University of Otago,
Dunedin, New Zealand)
Project Description: Aquaculture provides half the
seafood consumed worldwide, and is expected to in-
crease substantially as wild sheries have little or no
scope for increased production. New Zealand has the
potential to be a major producer; however, a lack of
domesticated species is one factor that hinders develop-
ment and protability. Plant and Food Research aims
to enhance production of New Zealand's aquaculture
sector by developing accelerated breeding approaches for
native marine nsh species. Our main target species is
the culturally and commercially important Australasian
snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), a species that we have
been breeding for over 10 years and for which we can
reliably produce a large numbers of juveniles.
The ability to control sex is one of the most important
factors for the commercialisation and ecient propa-
gation of new sh species due to inuences on repro-duction, growth and product quality. Snapper have no
heterochromosomes and are sexually monomorphic and
it is not known how sex determination is achieved. His-
tological sexing is also complicated as juvenile snapper
have a bisexual gonad with an ovarian lumen from which
ovaries or testes develop. Dierentiation to ovaries pro-
gresses in all sh until 7 months. Subsequently half of
the sh continues to develop their ovaries, while the
other half starts to develop testis until maturation at
around 3 years. Plant and Food Research has recently
assembled the snapper genome and transcriptome, and
generated whole genome re-sequencing and GBS data
that can be mined for genomic regions associated with
sex. The aim of this research project is to i) utilise these
whole genome and transcriptome sequence data to inves-
tigate the molecular basis for sexual determination in
snapper and, ii) develop markers that can be used to de-
termine sex early in snapper life history. Investigations
will initially focus on a comparative genomics approach
that utilises knowledge about sex determining genes
from other species and mining the available genomic
resources for their presence. Gene expression data from
snapper at dierent ontogenetic time stages will also be
generated and used to gain insights into the functional
roles of potential sex determining genes. Finally, we will
use the GBS data available to search for sex specic
SNPs. Based on this knowledge, candidate sex specic
markers will be developed and trialled in a number of
snapper of known sex from across the species geographic
range. The generation of a sex marker for snapper will
improve broodstock management and enables to develop
appropriate breeding schemes.
The Ideal Candidate: We are seeking an outstanding
student with broad interests in genetics to conduct re-
search into the genetic basis of sex determination in
snapper. Although a good level of bioinformatic skills
would be required to complete this project, a highly mo-
tivated student should be able to learn suitable Linux
and scripting to undertake this task. Some background
in statistics or programming would be an advantage, but
training will be provided through the Plant and Food
bioinformatics team, with support from the Gemmell
lab While the project would be largely computational
analysis, it would also involve RNA sampling and ex-
traction. This is an opportunity to work more closely
with industry, and would involve some time working at
the Plant and Food Research hatchery in Nelson.
The project compartmentalises so there is prospect for
this to be developed as either a BSc (Hons) or an MSc
degree. Applications should include a curriculum vitae,
academic transcripts, contact details of two academic
referees and a cover letter that states why the candidate
is interested in the position and how their qualications32 EvolDir April 1, 2017
and experience make them a good t for the proposed
research. Please email with completed applications and

sor Neil Gemmell (neil.gemmell@otago.ac.nz).Closing
date for applications is the end of March 2017.

NewZealand SnapperSequencing
PhD Project Opportunity
Testing for Fishing-Induced Evolution using Genotyping-
by-Sequencing of Ancient and Modern Snapper
We are seeking a highly-motivated PhD student for a
project that aims to test for shing-induced evolution
in New Zealand Snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) using
Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) of modern and an-
cient DNA.
Project Supervisors Dr. Peter Ritchie, Victoria Uni-
versity of Wellington (VUW), New Zealand Dr. Nic
Rawlence, Department of Zoology, University of Otago,
New Zealand Dr. Maren Wellenreuther, Plant and Food
Research (PFR), Nelson, New Zealand
Fishing typically targets larger individuals and thus has
the potential to increase the reproductive success of
small sh that mature early. Numerous studies have
reported a decrease in the average size of heavily shed
species and the age of maturation, but there is uncer-
tainty about whether this is caused by directional se-
lection on allele frequencies (evolutionary change). The
overall goal of this PhD project is to test for shing-
induced evolution in New Zealand snapper by comparing
DNA isolated from contemporary populations, to the
DNA isolated from bones of pre-industrial sh samples.
New Zealand has a unique record of snapper bones that
have been preserved in prehistoric New Zealand mid-
dens (i.e. places where food remains were dumped orburied). The successful candidate for this project will be
responsible for collecting a GBS dataset of genome-wide
SNPs using DNA extracted from contemporary samples.
This position will be based at Victoria University of
Wellington (New Zealand). The data set collected from
contemporary samples will be combined with a compa-
rable dataset recovered from snapper ancient DNA that
will be obtained by researchers at the Otago Palaeoge-
netics Laboratory. The complete physical isolation of
the ancient and modern part of the project will ensure
there is minimal risk of cross-contamination. This am-
bitious and innovative approach will provide the level
of resolution needed to identify genomic regions that
have experienced selection and make precise population
genetic and demographic inferences possible.
PhD Project Aims 1. To test whether size-selective
industrial shing is associated with a signature of ge-
netic selection, 2. Determine levels of genetic diversity
and dierentiation, 3. Test for loci under selection and
adaptive genetic variation.
This project will provide an excellent opportunity to de-
velop skills in the areas of genomics, bioinformatics and
population genetics, and how they can be used to sup-
port sustainable harvesting. The PhD student will gain
experience working with collaborators in New Zealand
(Professor Hamish Spencer), Australia (Professor Mike
Bunce), and Norway (Dr. Bastiaan Star). The PhD
student will be a member of a highly active and collabo-
rative group of researchers, and help develop population
genomics and an understanding of how human activity
is changing the environment.
The successful candidate will be a highly-motivated
researcher, with a strong background and interest in
genomics and molecular evolution. Experience with a
coding and/or scripting languages will be an advantage.
This position will be based at Victoria University of
Wellington and comes with a three-year scholarship that
provides a stipend (NZ $27,500 pa) and university tu-
ition fees. This project is supported by the New Zealand
Marsden Fund.
Applicants should send a CV, contact details of
two academic referees and a cover letter that states
why you are interested in the position and how your
qualications and experience make you a good t for the
proposed research. Send these to Peter Ritchie (E-mail:

StAndrews EvolutionaryTheory
PHD IN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY
A PhD position is available in the group of Dr. Carolin
Kosiol at the Centre of Biological Diversity of the Uni-
versity of St. Andrews/Scotland. The position will be
funded for 3.5 years.
The PhD project is part of a larger project entitled
\Genome-wide molecular dating". The recent sequenc-
ing of genomes of closely related species and of many
individuals from the same species enables the study of
speciation and the inference of the history of populations.
Standard phylogenetic methods reduce entire popula-
tions to single points in genotypic space by modelling
evolution as a process in which a single gene mutates
along the branches of a phylogeny.
In my group, we have developed an allele-frequency
based approach called Polymorphism-Aware Phyloge-
netic Models (PoMo, De Maio, et al., 2015, Schrempf
et al., 2016). While standard phylogenetic models treat
substitutions as instantaneous events, PoMo describes
them as gradual: substitutions require rst a mutation
introducing a new rare allele, followed by a series of
changes in allele frequency. This innovation accounted
for many problems in classical phylogenetics, such as
incomplete lineage sorting and shared ancestral poly-
morphisms that cause the tree topology to vary along

Funded PhD studentship in microbial ecology and/or
microbial evolution at the University of Aberdeen (UK).
A 3.5-year PhD studentship in microbial ecology and/or
microbial evolution, starting in May 2017 at the ear-
liest, is now open for application at the University of
Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The deadline for applications
is April 10th 2016 and there is no restriction regarding
the nationality of the applicants (no fee incurred for
non-EU nationals).
The project will be designed with the PhD supervisors
depending on the interest of the applicant, including on
microbial ecology, evolution, physiology and/or bioin-
formatics. The PhD project will target ey scientic
questions with a special focus on Thaumarchaeota to
align with the research thematic of the University of
Aberdeen Nitrication Group.
Thaumarchaeota form an abundant and ubiquitous phy-
lum of archaea on Earth. They perform a critical ecosys-
tem function, ammonia oxidation to nitrite, which is
subsequently oxidised to nitrate in the process of ni-
trication. Ammonia oxidisers limit nitrication, and
thereby play a central role in the global N cycle. Insoil, they lead to considerable loss of N fertiliser, nitrate
leaching into groundwaters and production of green-
house gases. Thaumarchaeotal cultivation is in its in-
fancy, especially that of soil Thaumarchaeota, but is
currently being achieved employing a combination of
DNA-SIP soil incubations, innovative cultivation ap-
proaches and single-cell genomics and metagenomics.
These approaches are being applied in the University of
Aberdeen Nitrication Group to study environmental
adaptation of these microbes in soil. In recent years,
our research has demonstrated that pH is a ey factor
controlling the composition of the soil Thaumarchaeota
community, which plays an important role in nitrica-
tion in acidic soils. In addition to inuencing extant
thaumarchaeotal niche specialisation, pH has also in-
uenced their diversication and patterns of lineage
formation through deep evolutionary time. The exis-
tence of several ecologically coherent dominant phylo-
genetic lineages ('pH-adapted lineages') has also been
demonstrated and several mechanisms of specialisation
for acidophilic growth have been suggested for the thau-
marchaeotal strains acquired in the laboratory. Finally,
our research expands to other Thaumarchaeota that do
not perform ammonia oxidation in order to understand
the evolution of these physiological metabolisms.

Funded PhD studentship in microbial ecology at the Uni-
versity of Aberdeen (UK): ?Unravelling the metabolic
versatility and diversity of abundant but unexplored
terrestrial Thaumarchaeota?.
A 4-year PhD studentship in microbial ecology, starting
in March 2017 at the earliest, is now open for appli-
cation at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.
The deadline for applications is March 17th 2016 and
this studentship is available to UK and EU nationals
(providing funding for tuition fees and stipend). The
PhD project is funded by the Royal Society and will
target key scientic questions with a special focus on
Thaumarchaeota to align with the research thematic of
the University of Aberdeen Nitrication Group.
The vast microbial diversity in natural environments
underpins the global ecosystem functioning on earth.
The central aim of this project is to understand the
largely underexplored physiological and ecological pro-
cesses that generate high microbial functional diversity
in nature, with a special focus on a functionally impor-
tant group of archaea, the Thaumarchaeota, that play
a key role in the nitrogen cycle. Their high diversity
and abundance, together with our recent demonstra-
tion of the inuence of pH on both niche specialisation
(Gubry-Rangin et al., 2011; Vico-Oton et al., 2016)
and lineage formation through deep evolutionary time
(Gubry-Rangin et al., 2015), provide an excellent system
to address this aim. The paucity of cultivated repre-
sentatives has severely limited their investigation, but
this restriction can now be alleviated by major recent
technical innovations in single cell genome sequencing
and cultivation techniques (informed by genomic data)enabling physiological studies (Lehtovirta-Morley et al.,
2011; 2016). Better knowledge about an abundant, glob-
ally distributed but unexplored and uncultivated group
of Thaumarchaeota that dominate ammonia oxidiser
communities in many agricultural neutral and alkaline
soils seems crucial to unravel their ecophysiology and
contribution to soil nitrication and greenhouse gas emis-
sion. By using a single-cell genomics-driven cultivation
approach, the physiological mechanisms implicated in
thaumarchaeotal alkaline adaptation will be determined,
and novel isolates will in turn allow further experimen-
tal physiological studies. The suggested mechanisms
allowing growth, activity and preferential selection over
the other nitrifying communities will nally be tested in
many alkaline soils. This ambitious project will strongly
impact on our fundamental knowledge of the general in-
tegrated ecological-functional mechanisms of adaptation
that generate high microbial diversity in nature, using
Thaumarchaeota as a model.

How does novelty arise in evolution? Does environmen-
tal change drive genome complexity, and if so how?
These are central questions in evolutionary biology, and
they are the questions that drive research in our lab.38 EvolDir April 1, 2017
Using a combination of molecular genetic manipula-
tions/analyses and experimental evolution, within the
context of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) you will
explore whether more complex GRNs promote survival
and create opportunities for innovation in changeable en-
vironments. This project will conduct experiments with
a genetically modied common soil bacterium that has
had the 'master switch' of the agellar network deleted.
Firstly, it will address the role that gene duplication
plays in the evolution of complex gene networks. It
will do this by observing the divergence between dupli-
cated genes from a dierent network that is capable of
'mending' agellar function (1). Secondly, it will test the
hypothesis that more complex networks provide a tness
benet in less predictable environments (2). It will do
this by using genetically manipulated bacteria with step-
wise increases in network complexity and evolve them
in static and changing environments. Lastly, it will look
across a range of bacteria of the same species, which
inhabit dierent environments, to link life-histories with
network architecture (3).
Location: This project will be conducted under the di-
rect supervision of Dr Tiany Taylor with co-supervision
from Prof Laurence Hurst, and based at the Depart-
ment of Biology and Biochemistry at the University
of Bath (UK) in the new Milner Centre for Evolu-
tion (http://www.bath.ac.uk/groups/milner-centre-for-

focused on doing ground breaking research that ad-
dresses major questions in evolutionary biology. The
Milner Genomics Centre provides on-site facilities and
expertise for genome sequencing and analysis for evo-
lution research, and the world-class researchers at the
centre creates a vibrant research culture that ensures
support and training for the next generation of evolu-
tionary biologist.
Requirements: This is a fully-funded PhD studentship.
We are looking for a biology graduate who has a strong
interest in genetics and evolution. Some practical ex-
perience in microbiology and molecular techniques is
highly desired but training will be provided. The suc-

UHelsinki MathModellingEvolution
Graduate position for a PhD in mathematical modelling
in evolution and development:
1.Job/ project description:
The main objectives of the PhD project is to:
Develop computational models of organ development
(morphogenesis and pattern formation) and their evolu-
tion in mammalian teeth, hair or Drosophila wing.
The research will take place in the Center of Excellence
in Experimental and computational developmental biol-
ogy of the Biotechnology Institute of the Helsinki Uni-
versity under the supervision of Isaac Salazar-Ciudad.
Embryonic development is one of the most amazing phe-
nomena in life. During development a single cell trans-
forms into a complex functional organism made of many
cells, dierent cell types and a specic spatial distribu-
tion of those in space. How embryos organize themselves
so that each cell ends up located in a specic position in
the body is the central question of pattern formation and
morphogenesis. This process involves the interaction of
many genes in complex networks and the interaction of
those with cells' and tissue's mechanical properties. In
addition, this process is now widely acknowledged to be
crucial to understand evolution since any change in the
phenotype in evolution (e.g. morphology) would be rst
a change in the developmental process by which this
phenotype is produced. Understanding development,
thus, would allows us to understand which phenotypic
variation can arise in populations due to genetic muta-
tion (the so called genotype-phenotype map) and that,
together with natural selection, would determine the
direction of evolution. Understanding this link between
development and evolution is a central aspect of the
research in Salazar-Ciudad group.
Computational models are important tools to under-
stand how gene networks interact with cell and tissue
mechanical properties in development. There is cur-
rently a huge amount of data on how genes interact
during development but data alone do not directly leadApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 39
to understanding. The large number of genes involved,
the complexity of the gene networks and cell and tissue
mechanics in development require the building of precise
quantitative hypotheses, the building of mathematical
models to explore the consequences of these hypotheses
and the comparison between models' predictions and
well designed quantitative experiments. The center of
experimental and computational developmental biology
is a pioneering center combining models and experi-
ments with this approach. In that sense the PhD will
include collaborating with experimental developmental
biologists, bioinformaticians, populational and quanti-
tative geneticists, systems biologists, mathematicians,
paleontologists and other evolutionary biologists.
The modeling will focus on integrating gene network
regulation, cell-cell communication, cell mechanical in-
teractions and developmental mechanisms in general
and, optionally, artical in silico evolution.
2. Requirements:
The applicant must be a biologists preferably with a
strong background in either evolutionary biology, devel-
opmental biology or theoretical biology. Some knowl-
edge of ecology, zoology, cell and molecular biology are
also desirable.
Bioinformaticians, systems biologists or computer biolo-
gists that do not have a degree in biology or a strong
background in biology will not be considered (e.g. no
engineers or computer scientists).
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.
The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science, embryonic development and
evolution. A capacity for creative and critical thinking
is also required.
3. Description of the position:

ApodemusEvolutionaryGenomics
A 3-year PhD studentship in evolutionary genomics of
wood and yellow-necked mice (Apodemus avicollis and
sylvaticus), starting in September 2017, is now open
for applications at the University of Hudderseld, West
Yorkshire, UK. The deadline for applications is 26th
March 2017. The studentship is funded by the Uni-
versity of Hudderseld and available to UK and EU
nationals.
Rodents from the genus Apodemus are the most common
mammals in the Palearctic and an attractive subject
for evolutionary and molecular studies: they are likely
to be under multitude of selective pressures in dier-
ent habitats, they contribute to the spread of Lyme
disease and tick-borne encephalitis and harbour extra
(\B") chromosomes. However, the genomic and genetic
resources for their studies remain very limited.40 EvolDir April 1, 2017
We are a young and small research group that has re-
cently embarked on establishing phylogenetic and phylo-
geographic relationships between Apodemus populations
in Europe based on whole-genome genotypes. Thanks
to collaboration with researchers in Poland, Germany
and Belgium we are presently acquiring and analysing
whole-genome high-density genotyping data (ddRAD-
seq) from hundreds of individuals across Europe. Anal-
ysis of this data will inform future directions of our
studies: phylogeography of sylvaticus and avicolis, di-
versity and divergence of their populations, SNP-based
genetic maps and whole-genome scans for signatures of
positive selection.
We are looking for an independent candidate with keen
interest in evolution and computational approaches to
study genetic variation on a population scale. Famil-
iarity with UNIX/Linux, command line or R is a plus,
as is research experience, preferably on a master's level,
but strong B.Sc. graduates are also encouraged to apply.
Majority of the project involves computational analyses
of large datasets, but it has a small wet-lab component,
such as preparation of DNA and/or RNA sequencing
libraries.
The PhD student will be associated with the Evolution-
ary and Environmental Genomics Group at the Depart-
ment of Biological Sciences and embedded with PhD stu-
dents in the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Centre who
work on human and cattle phylogeography, archaeoen-
tomology, yeast transposable elements and evolution of

GeneticEpidemiologyBioinformatics
The following 3 year PhD studentship is being re-
advertised for a September 2017 start.
Title: Using genetic epidemiology to understand the role
of complex genetic variation of immune system genes in
respiratory health and disease
Supervised by Dr Louise Wain and Dr Ed Hollox (De-
partment of Genetics)
The studentship is for 3 years and will commence in
September 2017. The student will be based in the De-
partment of Health Sciences.
Respiratory disease is a major public health concern and
the third leading cause of death globally. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identied multiple re-
gions of the genome associated with respiratory health
and disease and amongst these, one of the strongest sig-
nals of association is in the Human Leukocyte Antigen
(HLA) region gene cluster on chromosome 6 which en-
codes proteins with essential roles in the immune system.
However, the HLA region is complex and understand-
ing the mechanisms underlying the genetic signals of
association in this region requires sophisticated analyti-
cal approaches. Bespoke computational methods which
measure variation of the HLA region, and of other clus-
ters of functionally-related genes, at both the genetic
and protein level, have been developed. This project
will involve applying these methods to large general
population cohorts to explore both the direct and inter-
active eects of variation at immune gene clusters on
respiratory traits and disease. The student will develop
computational research skills at the interface of genetics,
statistics and computer science which will equip them
for a career in the exciting and fast-moving eld of ge-
netic epidemiology. A background in bioinformatics,
genetics or statistics is preferred and a keen interest
and aptitude for developing further skills in all of those
areas, and in the use of high performance computing to
analyse very large data sets, is essential.

Project title: Next-generation kinship deduction for
forensic and genealogical analysis
We seek a highly-motivated student with an interest in
statistics, genomics, population genetics and/or forensic
genetics, to work with us and our industrial partner
DNA WorldWide (https://www.dna-worldwide.com), a
direct-to-consumer DNA testing company oering an-
cestry, paternity and kinship testing.
The use of DNA analysis to determine familial rela-
tionships between human individuals is well established.
For close (rst-degree) pairwise relationships as targeted
in the paternity test, a small number of polymorphic
markers (the short-tandem repeats [STRs] also used
in forensic individual identication) is analysed, and
probabilities of true paternity can be established with
near certainty. However, there is also a need in some
applications to estimate more distant kin relationships:
in forensic casework 'familial searching' exploits the fact
that a perpetrator and their relative(s) are expected
to share 'similar' DNA proles, which can provide in-
vestigative information when the relative(s) are in the
National DNA Database but the perpetrator is not; in
immigration cases a claim of relationship may need to be
validated in order to allow entry to the UK; in genealog-
ical research participants may have specic hypotheses
about their relationships which they wish to support
via DNA evidence. The kinship estimation problem
is more dicult in these cases because with each ad-
ditional generation that separates two individuals, the
expected proportion of the genome shared identical by
descent (IBD) halves. Additional power can be gained
by increasing the number of DNA markers analysed, for
example by using genome-wide SNP chips.
The project proposed here addresses these issues by
exploring the potential of NGS forensic multiplexes and
genome-wide SNP data in relationship estimation, us-
ing real-world data. Forensically relevant data will begenerated by typing either the Promega Powerseq or
Illumina Forenseq multiplex on existing pedigree DNA
resources (e.g. CEPH families; French-Canadian deep-
rooting pedigrees). Anonymised genome-wide SNP data
will be obtained from DNA WorldWide (consenting
clients, and a dataset of 72 individuals from 9 pedigrees).
Both the forensic multiplexes and the genome-wide data
(based on the HumanOmniExpressExome-8 chip) in-
clude uniparentally-inherited markers (Y chromosome,
mitochondrial DNA) as well as biparentally-inherited
(autosomal) markers. A novel feature of this project is
to investigate ecient incorporation of such data with
SNP-based likelihood estimates by considering haplo-
type frequencies and possible pedigree structures includ-
ing sex. A key issue will be to understand the sensitivity
of relationship estimation to allele frequencies, and a
number of approaches will be taken, including the use of
internal frequencies from the data themselves, data from
public resources such as HapMap, or our own datasets.
Consideration will also be given to population structure,
admixture and the eects of linkage disequilibrium. De-
tailed sensitivity analyses will be carried out through
extensive simulation studies.

EvolTheoryApplied2Cancer
Fully funded position with stipend. EU and other over-
seas candidates welcome.
There is a repertoire of theory in evolutionary ecology
to explain the rate and nature of adaptation to sudden
changes in the environment, particularly pesticide use
and rapid climate change. This body of evolutionary the-
ory is strongly analogous to that needed to explain the
emergence of resistance during cancer therapy - both
involve a sudden new selective regime (temperature,
presence of a pesticide or drug). In this PhD project,
we propose to translate this theory to understand the
development of resistant clones in cancer, and then to
construct new treatment regimes that are designed to
forestall or even prevent their emergence. The project
will involve theory development, and then bioinformatic
analysis of human cancer data and in vitro evolution
experiments to critically evaluate the theoretical predic-
tions.This is an interdisciplinary collaboration between

A PhD position: Transgenerational non-genetic (epige-
netic) eects in zebrash at I-DEEL, E&ERC, UNSW,
Australia
It is increasingly clear that non-genetic (epigenetic)
parental eects inuence not only the phenotypes of
ospring but also those of grand-ospring. However, we
still know very little about the extent of this eect in
the subsequent generations, and its specic mechanisms.
The project will use a zebrash model to close this gap
in our understanding of transgenerational non-genetic
eects by taking an integrative evolutionary framework.April 1, 2017 EvolDir 45
Our group (http://www.i-deel.org/) is seeking a PhD
candidate to take on this project. The candidate
will conduct experiments using zebrash to investigate
how parental conditions can transgenerationally inu-
ence subsequent generations; we especially focus on
behavioural traits. We have access to a state-of-the-art
zebrash facility and molecular facility in collaboration
with Dr. Dan Hasselson at the Garvan Institute of
Medical Research (www.garvan.org.au). There, we have
developed a high-throughput behavioural phenotyping
system. High quality behavioural data will be combined
with cutting edge molecular data (individual-based tran-
scriptome and methylation data) to explore the im-
pact of parental environments on subsequent ospring
behaviour. We also employ modern genome editing
techniques (CRISPR, TALEN) to manipulate parental
genomes and thus the potential molecular mechanisms
under investigation.
This project is challenging and uniquely interdisciplinary,
by mixing molecular genetics, evolutionary biology, be-
havioural ecology and statistical modeling. Therefore,
the candidate will learn not only molecular techniques
but also advanced statistical and computational meth-
ods. There are also opportunities for the candidate to
develop their own PhD project with us. Note that our
lab conducts many meta-analyses, comparative analyses
and computer simulation work so these kind of projects
can be blended into the PhD thesis.

PhD Project Opportunity
Parasitic Puppeteers - How do They Pull the Strings?
We are currently seeking at least one, but potentially
several PhD students with interests in genetics, evolu-
tion, parasitology and neuroscience to investigate the
molecular mechanisms through which parasitic worms
alter the behaviour of their insect hosts.
Project Description Parasites can have profound eects
on the animal hosts they invade, manipulating host bi-
ology with exquisite precision to enhance host-to-host
transmission. One of the most extraordinary of these
host manipulations is the water-seeking behaviour that
some nematodes and hairworms induce in their hosts
so that the worms might exit the host and reproduce.
The process is the stu of science ction; the worm
hijacks the host's central nervous system forcing it to
seek water. Once water is found the adult worm, often
many times the size of the host, emerges, sacricing the
host. This amazing alteration in behaviour is induced by
parasitic worms spanning two phyla (Nematoda and Ne-
matomorpha) and is observed in a variety of arthropod
hosts, notably crickets, weta, earwigs, and sandhoppers,
leading us to hypothesise that a common and conserved
mechanism is being utilised by the parasites to induce
this behaviour in their hosts. Here we propose to couple
eld and laboratory studies of two phylogenetically dis-
tinct hosts and their parasites, with powerful genomic
and bioinformatic comparisons to elucidate the trig-
ger and genetic cascade through which these parasiticpuppeteers elicit this highly conserved, yet astonishing
behavioural response.
The project emerges from a new Marsden Grant headed
by Professor Neil Gemmell (Anatomy) in collaboration
with Professor Robert Poulin (Zoology) and will be
based in the Gemmell laboratory at the University of
Otago.
The Ideal Candidate The ideal candidate will possess
experience in molecular genetics/genomics, evolution-
ary biology and bioinformatics. Knowledge of NGS
approaches and analyses us desirable, while past work
in comparative genomics and an interest in parasitol-
ogy and neurobiology may be helpful. They candidate
will be motivated and organized, with a demonstrated
capacity to master the broad skill set necessary for the
successful completion of a research project. They will
be collegial and able to work alongside a wide variety
of people. In addition they will have a strong commit-
ment to academic and research excellence. Minimum
qualications: B.Sc. (Hons) and/or M.Sc. in Genetics,
Genomics, Molecular Biology or equivalent with an A
average or better.
Scholarship Funding: Financial support is expected to
be available for a high achieving student with an A
average or better via a University of Otago or Depart-

PhD in Epigenetic Theory
A PhD position is available within the Department of
Zoology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New
Zealand. This position in the laboratory of Professor
Hamish G. Spencer is funded by the Marsden Fund of
the Royal Society of New Zealand. A scholarship cover-
ing fees plus a tax-free stipend of NZ $27,500 per year is
available for three years.
The project is part of a larger project entitled \Epi-
genetics and Evolutionary Theory." Just as natural
populations exhibit genetic variation, so too do they
harbour epigenetic variation, some of which is trans-
mitted from one generation to the next. This project
asks how we can explain this transgenerationally in-
herited epigenetic variation in natural populations and
what might be the consequences for evolution. The can-
didate will construct and analyse novel mathematical
models to investigate these matters, validating these
models with data from real examples, and using the
models to make novel predictions about the properties
of epigenetic variation in nature.
The successful candidate will have a strong interest in ap-
plying quantitative methods in biology. They will have a
degree in biology and/or mathematics (or a related eld)
that included a research component (e.g., a dissertation
or a thesis). The degree (e.g., BSc(Hons), MSc) will
have been awarded with rst-class honours/distinction.
Our research group and the wider Department includes
world-class research sta, facilities and strong interna-
tional collaborations, oering excellent opportunities to

PhD Project Opportunity Available to Investigate the
Reproductive Ecology of Clover Root Weevils to Inform
New Biocontrol Strategies
We are currently seeking at least one PhD student with
interests in genetics, evolution, and behavioural ecology
to conduct research into the reproductive ecology of
clover root weevil and its implications for an exciting
new pest management method called the Trojan female
technique.
Project Description: Maternally inherited mitochondrial
DNA can accumulate mutations deleterious to males
so long as the mutations are neutral for females - a
phenomenon dubbed \Mother's curse". Often these
mutations reduce male fertility. Recently it was recog-
nised that this male-fertility-reducing curse could, in
theory, be cast upon invasive pests through an approach
known as the 'Trojan female technique' (TFT). The
TFT involves nding male-fertility-reducing mitochon-
drial mutations, breeding up populations of the female
carriers in captivity, then releasing them into the eld
where their infertile male progeny reduce reproduction
of the wild population. The TFT concept has recently
been proven in laboratory trials and we are now working
towards the world-rst eld implementation against a
New Zealand pasture pest called clover root weevil.
The ecacy of the TFT will be partly dependent on the
reproductive ecology of clover root weevil: How often
does a female mate, and with how many males? How
long does she store sperm for? Which male's sperm
does she use to fertilise her eggs? Can she choose? Is
sperm from males that carry one or more deleterious
mitochondrial mutations equally competitive with the
sperm of wild-type males? Answers to these and related
questions are critical for optimally implementing the
TFT against clover root weevil and other similar pests.
The project emerges from a new MBIE Smart Ideas
grant headed by Dr Craig Phillips (AgResearch, Lin-
coln) in collaboration with Prof Neil Gemmell (Otago),
Dr Damian Dowling (Monash University, Australia) and
Dr Dan Tompkins (Landcare Research, Dunedin). The
PhD position will be based predominantly based at
AgResearch Lincoln with a requirement to also spend
time in the Gemmell laboratory at the University of
Otago.48 EvolDir April 1, 2017
The Ideal Candidate: The ideal candidate will pos-
sess experience in molecular genetics, genomics and
evolutionary genetics, likely with direct application in
addressing questions relating to mating systems and
mate choice. Knowledge of entomology, microscopy and
molecular genetic approaches and analyses will be a
distinct advantage. The successful candidate will be
motivated and organised, with a demonstrated capacity
to master the broad skill set necessary for the success-
ful completion of a research project. They will be a

PhD scholarship for a project on sexual selection in
guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
Supervisor Andrea Pilastro, University of Padova, Italy
Application Process:
The University of Padova, Italy, oers 15 PhD positions
to non-Italian students (deadline March 28, 2017, see:
http://www.unipd.it/en/research/doctoral-degrees-phd-
programmes/phd-courses-fees-grants-and-benets#).
The scholarships is 13.638 euros per year for 3 years,
but it comes with full board and free lodging (at the
University residences and canteens), so basic costs of
living are covered. Furthermore, the fellowship will be
increased by 50% during periods spent abroad (which
need to be approved by the PhD School board) in other
research institutions for study and research.
Padova is a lively town, close to the Venice, the Adriatic
see and the Dolomites, and hosts about 50000 undergrad-
uate and 1400 graduate students. Our PhD School in
Biosciences (http://dottorato.biologia.unipd.it/) enrols
approx 50 PhD students and adopt English as working
language.
Selection of candidates is based on CV, proposed re-
search plan and recommendation letters from two previ-
ous supervisors. Preliminary agreement on the research
project with a supervisor at U Padua (that will cover
research funds) is also an important selection criterion.
Selection will be completed
The U Padua usually receives about 500 applications for
the 15 positions. Competition may therefore be hard,
although really eligible applicants (with good CV, two
reference letters and a project agreement) are usually a
small fraction of the total applicants.
The list of the candidates that will get a fellowship will
be published by 26th June 2017. Succesful candidates
will have to conrm their will to enroll by July 3rd 2017
and courses will start on
Any graduate student interested in doing a PhD in my
lab in the topic described below is encouraged to con-
tact me (andrea.pilastro@unipd.it), by sending a brief
CV and a statement of research interests. Deadline for
applications is March 28, 2017. Below a brief, general
description of the proposed research topic.
Proposed projectApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 49
Interaction between pre- and post-mating episodes of
sexual selection in a variable environment
In polyandrous species, sexual selection acts on reproduc-
tive traits during both pre- and post-mating episodes of
selection. While the scientic literature exploring these
two episodes singularly is vast, we are just starting to
explore how the overall variance (the potential for 'total
sexual selection' to act) in reproductive success can be
decomposed into its pre- and post-mating components
(see Devigili et al 2015, 2016 for some recent study). In
particular, although there is strong evidence that ecolog-
ical and social factors can modify singular components
of the sexual selection process, very little experimental
work has actually explored how total sexual selection
is aected by variations in ecological factors. Modica-
tions in the strength and direction of the relationships
between traits involved in mating and fertilization suc-
cess would have important evolutionary implications
(e.g. maintenance of additive genetic variation in sexual
traits, genetic bets of mate choice, contribution of sex-
ual selection to adaptation to environmental changes).
Following established experimental protocols (Devigili et
al. 2015), we will use replicated populations of guppies
(Poecilia reticulata) to investigate how experimentally
manipulated environmental and social factors aect the
level of polyandry, variances in mating rate and compet-
itive fertilization success. Traits associated with mating
and fertilization success are well known in this species
(Evans et al. 2003; Pilastro et al. 2004; Devigili et al.
2016) and will allow a trait-based analyses of selection
across a range of conditions.

www.ieg.uu.se . Project description: Natural occurrence
of polyploidy, inter-specic hybridization and the ability
to propagate asexually, together with accelerated ow-
ering (less than 1 year) and a relatively small genome
size of 440 Mb with a recent reference genome sequence,
make birches ideal for evolutionary biology studies in
trees. In the present project, we will investigate the rel-
ative contributions of hybridization, population history
and selection to local adaptation and thereby address
the response of Swedish birch populations to global
warming. The work will combine population genomic
studies of hybridization and local adaptation along lat-
itudinal gradients with controlled experiments of the
response of birches to elevated temperatures. These new
data, together with data from birch breeding programs,
will be used to evaluate the potential of genomic selec-
tion for developing advanced breeding material better
adapted to the forthcoming environmental conditions.
The applicant will be involved in material collection,
DNA extraction, bioinformatics, growth chamber ex-
periments and populations genetic analysis. The work
will be coupled to the ongoing EU project GENTREE,
which studies local adaptation of trees at European scale
in seven species. In this way there will be possibilities
to expand the PhD project in new directions. The work
will be co-led by Dr. Jarkko Salojarvi at University

PollinatorAdaptation
The Department of Ecology & Evolution at the Univer-
sity of Salzburg is oering
2 PhD positions for three years each
in the FWF-funded project \Local pollinator adaptation
in deceptive Arum maculatum" (Project leaders: Stefan
D otterl, Hans-Peter Comes, Anja H orger)
This project aims to identify 1) the ecological roles of
oral scent in the plant-pollinator interaction between
brood-site deceptive Arum maculatum and its main pol-
linators, Psychoda phalaenoides and Psycha grisescens;
and 2) the likely dierential selective inuence of each
moth y species and its olfactory preferences on inores-
cence scent divergence between European A. maculatum
populations along a latitudinal gradient covering areas
north and south of the Alps. The project will be pur-
sued along three axes. First, it will study the geographic
patterns of pollinators trapped in comparison to the in-
orescence scents emitted. Second, it will study the
mechanisms of pollinator attraction by looking which
molecule(s) within the blend is(are) responsible for de-
ceiving the two main pollinator species. Finally, it will
test for the involvement of inorescence scent in the
divergent local adaptation of A. maculatum by using
both ecological-experimental and genomic approaches.
One of the doctoral researchers will be mainly responsi-
ble for the ecological and chemo-ecological approaches
(dynamic headspace, gas chromatography / mass spec-
trometry; electroantennographic detection, behavioral
assays, multivariate statistical analyses), the second stu-
dent will focus on the genomic approaches (Rad-seq,
meta-barcoding, bioinformatics) and correlative analy-
ses (ecological-genomic). Both students are expected
to perform eld work (scent sampling, pollinator ob-
servations, reciprocal transplants) and supervise eld
assistants.
The successful applicants should be highly motivated,
procient in English language and scientic writing, and
have a research focus in one or more of the following
elds of research: a) pollination biology; b) chemical
ecology; c) population genetics/genomics. An MSc,
diploma degree or equivalent in Botany, Zoology, Ecol-
ogy, Genetics, Molecular Biology or Evolutionary Ecol-April 1, 2017 EvolDir 51
ogy is required. Previous eld and lab experience and/or
bioinformatics skills are of advantage.
The monthly gross salary is c. 2071 EUR (14 months of
payment per year). The University of Salzburg oers
excellent research facilities, and a very pleasant working
and living environment in a beautiful landscape with
numerous lakes and mountains.
Please send your application (letter of motivation, CV,
certicates, contacts of two potential referees) in elec-
tronic form as a single pdf le to Univ.-Prof. Dr. Stefan
D otterl, Stefan.Doetterl@sbg.ac.at. Please also indicate
your preference for the ecological or the genomic project.
The start date is scheduled for April 2017. The positions

We would like to advertise a PhD project at the Univer-
sity of St Andrews.
PhD studentship: Genomic predictors of reproductive
isolation in Drosophila
We are looking for a talented and motivated student
(UK or EU) to undertake a four-year PhD at the Uni-
versity of St Andrews, Scotland. Project details be-
low. Interested applicants are encouraged to contact
the primary supervisor, Prof. Mike Ritchie, via email
(mgr@st-andrews.ac.uk) before the application deadline
on March 27th.
Project summary
Reproductive isolation has long been recognised as a key
step in the process of speciation. The Biological Species
concept argues that isolation needs to be complete be-
tween 'good' species, but most recent research suggests
that this is far too stringent a criterion. Advances in
the availability and methods of analysis of genomes al-
low us to detect and quantify variation in gene ow
not only between species, but also between genomicregions within species. Much new data is emerging on
patterns of genomic divergence. This project will ex-
amine predictors of these patterns of divergence using
both existing and novel genomic data, in combination
with data on the ecology and measures of pre- and
post-mating reproductive isolation. The data will come
from Drosophila, which has a relatively well understood
genome, and detailed compilations of the strength of
dierent types of reproductive isolation exist. The stu-
dent will integrate existing and new genomic data into
this database and use novel analytical techniques to
determine genetic divergence and gene ow between
dierent genomic regions. Do similar patterns of ge-
nomic divergence correlate with sexual or post-mating
isolation? Do both inuence sex-chromosomes versus
autosomes similarly? Do ecological generalists show
dierent patterns from specialists? Do patterns dier
between sympatry and allopatry, and how often do we
detect gene ow in sympatric species? Co-supervisor1,
Konrad Lohse (Edinburgh), has developed new meth-
ods to detect introgression and regions of admixture
from such genomic data. Co-supervisor 2, Oscar Gag-
giotti (St Andrews), has developed methods to detect
genomic outliers while controlling for population history
and ecological covariates. Both will advise and help the
student apply such techniques to the data. The lead
supervisor, Michael Ritchie, brings extensive experience
of speciation in this group.

UUppsala PopulationGenomics
A PhD student position in population genomics is avail-
able at the department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala
University.
Closing date: 2017-04-30
Project description: The demographic history of many
species is currently being addressed with modern com-
putational methods combined with population genomic
data, especially humans that often function as a model
organism in this respect. In order to understand popu-
lation divergence processes, concepts of eective popu-lation size, population structure and genetic diversity
become important. Linking eective population size as a
function of time to population divergence and structure
is a major challenge for modern population genomics and
computational biology. The proposed project focuses
on trying to disentangle population structure and diver-
gence from population size (both eective and census)
changes. The project will investigate these processes
using large-scale population genomic data from humans
and archaic humans such as Neandertals.
The project is part of a larger program that links theoret-
ical population genetics, genomics and human evolution.
The successful candidate will work in Professor Mat-
tias Jakobsson research group together with Dr. Per
Sj odin. The group consists of ~25 researchers (senior
scientist, postdocs, graduate students and research en-
gineers) with dierent areas of expertise. The research
at the Jakobsson lab focus on population genetics and
human evolution and the lab uses a combination of
mathematical studies of population genetic models and
computational approaches to understand the complex
patterns of large-scale human genetic variation and their
implications for human demographic and evolutionary
history. In particular, the research focuses on under-
standing human evolution using genetic information
from both recent and ancient individuals, developing
statistical methods for analyzing large genomic data,
and searching for genes targeted by selection.
Qualications: A master degree (or equivalent) in a
relevant eld is required. The ideal candidate is highly
motivated with thorough education in quantitative disci-

Research Associate in Insect Pollinator Evolutionary
Ecology Imperial College London, UK - Department of
Life Sciences, Faculty of Natural Sciences
Closing date 6 April 2017 (Midnight GMT)
A NERC funded Research Associate position is avail-
able for 33 months in the research group of Dr Richard
Gill at Imperial College London's Silwood Park cam-
pus, to investigate insect pollinator responses to a cen-
tury of land-use change. This position will primarily
focus on population trait evolution of insect pollina-
tors, and the investigation of stress induced eects on
bee behaviour and colony tness. The position will
involve collaborating with researchers at the Natural
History Museum London who will generate complemen-
tary genomic datasets, and involve work with curators
from a number of UK museums to analyse insect speci-
mens and with researchers from NHM London, Queen
Mary University of London, Northampton University
and Christchurch University (New Zealand).
The Gill group's aim is to better understand how insect
pollinator populations (primarily bees) respond to land-
scape change, and how they adapt to newly emerging
environments and the impact on measures of tness.
The successful candidate will focus on addressing two
primary questions (i) whether there are regional adapta-
tions in response to dierential land-use change (LUC)
and (ii) whether specic factors associated with agri-
cultural LUC place a constraint on social bee colony
development and tness. This will involve analysis of
morphological variation using museum specimens, in-
vestigating phenological change from archival records,
and undertaking manipulation experiments alongside
behavioural observations. As part of this NERC project,
Prof Ian Barnes and Dr Selina Brace (@NHM London)
will be focusing on the recovery and analysis of ancient
DNA from museum specimens and we intend for the
successful candidate to also contribute to this aspect of
the project.
You should hold a PhD (or equivalent) in a Biological
Science. You will have a background in evolution and/or
ecology, with experience in the analysis of trait variation.
You will also have experience of husbandry, handling
or monitoring animals in the laboratory and/or eld.You will also have experience in experimental design
and will have the ability to analyse large data sets in
addition to a proven track record of publishing qual-
ity research. Previous experience in using any of the
following methods is desirable: micro-CT scanning tech-
nology, geometric morphometrics, observation of animal
behaviour and collections-based research.
This full-time, xed-term post has a start date of
19 June 2017 (but with some exibility). Infor-
mal enquiries should be directed to Dr Richard
Gill at r.gill@imperial.ac.uk and further details of
the Gill research group can be found at: https:/-

Greifswald is a beautiful town located at the Baltic Sea,
a popular holiday region. Student life here is vibrant,
and the university has a long tradition - in fact, it is
one of the oldest universities of Europe. Our institute
is one of only a few places in Germany where students
can study biomathematics already at an undergraduate
level, which is why this study program attracts students
from all over Germany. Therefore, the majority of our
institute's students study biomathematics, but we also
have pure mathematics students as well as students who
want to become maths teachers. However, our institute
also does a lot of teaching for students of other sub-
jects that are not directly linked to our institute, e.g.
students of natural sciences.

Scientic assistant position - Vibrational Communica-
tion in Mantophasmatodea
Application deadline: 20.03.2017
A scientic assistant position (65% TV-L E13, 18 months
contract) is available at the University of Greifswald, in
the group of Dr. Monika Eberhard, Zoological Institute
and Museum, General and Systematic Zoology (chair:
Prof. Gabriele Uhl). The successful candidate will join
the DFG-funded research project
Vibrational Communication Signals in Mantophasma-todea: Species Recognition, Sexual Selection, and Pop-
ulation Dierentiation.
We are investigating the vibrational signals of
Mantophasmatodea-species that occur in several popula-
tions at dierent localities in the Western Cape Region,
South Africa, a biodiversity hotspot. Variability of vi-
brational calls and morphological characters, as well
as genetic diversity using microsatellite markers will
be investigated in populations of the same species to
reveal the present state of population dierentiation of
Mantophasmatodea in the Western Cape. Behavioural
experiments will be conducted to assess the decisive
cues within vibrational communication calls, which are
used for species recognition. Field studies (in coop-
eration with University of Cape Town) will allow for
optimized seminatural laboratory setups. This will pro-
vide insight into the role vibrational communication
might play for population dierentiation and speciation
in Mantophasmatodea. Further possibilities of research
include anatomical studies, behavioural trials or phylo-
genetic analyses. The position is open for early stage
researchers (postgraduate or postdoc) or very dedicated
Bachelor with Honours.
The highly motivated candidate will use genetic analy-
ses (microsatellites, sequencing), morphological meth-
ods (light microscopy, SEM, microCT), and behavioural
trials (video, laser-doppler-vibrometry). Strong back-
ground in at least one of these skills would be advanta-
geous.
Requirements: - Either B.Sc. degree + Honours, M.Sc.,
or higher, in Biology (Zoology, Ecology, Behavioural or
Evolutionary Biology) - Strong background in Evolu-
tionary Biology - Practical experience in at least two
of the following areas: DNA-analysis (microsatellites,
sequencing), behavioural studies (eld and laboratory;
preferably with invertebrates), Ecology (population dy-
namics), morphology (SEM, micro-CT) - Very good
English skills (written and spoken) - Willingness to stay
in South Africa for a longer time period (ca. 6-8 weeks)
- Experience in analysis programs for the required data-
sets and statistics are an advantage
The position is available from April 2017 until lled.

samples. The genetics of quantitative traits is closely
associated to such research. We are now seeking a highly
competitive candidate with interests and competence
combining quantitative genetics and genomics.
The position is for four years and can then be tenured.
Specically, an associate senior lecturer (the Swedish
term for Assistant Professor) has the right to apply
for promotion to senior lecturer. If the associate se-
nior lecturer is deemed suitable and fullls the criteria
for promotion established by the Faculty Board he/she
shall be promoted to and employed permanently as se-
nior lecturer. At a subsequent step, an application for

Avian Plasma Progesterone levels
Dear All,
If you have used Enzo Life Sciences ELISA progesterone
kits (product # ADI-900-011 or ADI-901-011) for avian
plasma, could you please contact me? Compared to
the published results of other enzyme immunoassays,
I was surprised by the values returned after analyz-
ing avian plasma samples for progesterone, even when
plasma levels were diluted. I have had diculty nding
any published results in the literature using this exact
ELISA kit and Enzo has not been able to assist me in
this. Any help that you would be able to provide would

BloodCapillaries For DNA
Extraction
Dear all,
I am looking for the best solution to eciently collect
blood from birds in the eld (following venipuncture)April 1, 2017 EvolDir 77
for DNA extraction and subsequent Illumina sequencing.
Glass capillaries in my experience are the most ecient
means of collecting (as opposed to double-capped plastic
capillary tubes, which tend to have lower capillary forces
and leave back a lots of blood on the bird). However, I
have trouble nding glass capillaries coated with EDTA
rather than heparin.
1) Does anybody know a company producing EDTA-
coated glass capillaries? 2) Does anybody have experi-
ence with Illumina sequencing from blood collected in
heparinized tubes? (as heparin is supposed to inhibit e.g.
PCR) 3) Any other tips about how to most eciently
collect blood following venipuncture?
Any help or comment would be highly appreciated.

DO YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO CORAL
CONSERVATION RESEARCH?
The CCMI - LCRC in the Cayman Islands is recruiting
15 junior research assistants for an exciting new coral
reef and spatial ecology research experience for a two-
week period during the summer of 2017. Junior Research
Assistants (JRA's) will work alongside CCMI scientists
to focus on answering exciting questions regarding two
specic projects:
Project 1: Fish Herbivory and Productivity
This project is funded with the help of the Darwin Ini-
tiative, a UK government grant scheme that helps to
protect biodiversity and the natural environment in de-
veloping countries and UK overseas territories. Junior
research assistants will help assist with the expansion of
our knowledge regarding the population dynamics of key
herbivore species (such as parrotshes and urchins) in
the waters surrounding Little Cayman. Data collection
regarding competition in the spatial ecology between
reef shes, algae, and stony corals will contribute to
developing a biodiversity action plan for the Cayman
Islands.
Project 2: Coral Reef Resilience and Restoration
This project is part of our Long-term Assessment and
Monitoring Program (LAMP) funded by various or-
ganizations throughout the last 10 years. Junior re-
search assistants will assist with monitoring the health
of outplanted Acropora cervicornis colonies at 10 dif-
ferent restoration sites around Little Cayman, across
various parameters such as: bleaching, disease, preda-
tion, and fragmentation. Junior research assistants will
also be conducting benthic habitat surveys as part of
our Coral Reef Resilience and Restoration Research pro-
gram, where you will learn how to analyze data using
a new program called CoralNET. CoralNet is a free
platform developed by the University of California at
Santa Barbara which utilizes articial intelligence to
analyze the composition of marine benthic communi-
ties. Data collected from this research will contribute
to developing a restoration plan which will assist with
the identication of optimal restoration sites around the
Cayman Islands.LENGTH OF PROGRAMME:

REMINDER - ESEB SPECIAL TOPICS NETWORKS
2017
DEADLINE for proposals: 31 MARCH 2017
***ESEB Special Topic Networks - Call for proposals***
Small symposia, workshops and courses in various for-
mats can perform functions complementary to those of
the ESEB Congresses, allowing more focused interac-
tions within specialist areas, forging new links between
previously separate areas or fostering interdisciplinary
and innovative ideas that merge specialized elds. One-
o events can be valuable but the returns for connected
series of events can be even greater. Therefore, ESEB in-
vites proposals for Special Topic Networks (STNs) that
will support dynamic and exible series of small meet-
ings and/or other networking opportunities in focused
and currently active research areas.
Each STN will be funded for up to 6 years (subject to
review after 2 and 4 years of operation) with an an-
nual budget of up to 10 000 Euros. Two STNs were
initiated in 2016 (see http://eseb.org/prizes-funding/-
special-topic-networks/), two will be initiated in 2017
and then further STNs will be initiated every other year.
The format of these STNs is up to their organisers and
innovative ideas are encouraged. All elds of evolution-
ary biology are eligible. Applicants should provide a
proposal with the following components:
1) a description of the research area to be targeted,
showing why it is timely to address it in this way and
outlining the expected benets to the eld from the STN
(max. 1000 words), 2) a plan for the rst two years of
operation of the STN and an outline of activities overthe remaining years (max. 500 words), 3) the names and
aliations of the proposed organisers, with brief (max.
one page) CVs, and 4) a budget, with brief justication,
for the STN activities proposed for the rst two years.
Applicants should also identify an institution that is
prepared to open an account in which the funds can be
deposited and managed by the applicants. ?Overheads?
will not be paid to this institution but reasonable di-
rect administrative costs will be eligible. Funding for
each 2-year block will be subject to approval by the
STN Committee, established by Council, following re-
ceipt of a report of activities in the preceding 2 years.
The institution managing funds will be asked to pro-
vide a certied statement of expenditure to accompany
the report. The principal criterion for renewal will be
evidence that the funding provided had been used to
further interaction in the topic area.
Applications should be sent to the ESEB oce email
(oce@eseb.org) as PDF les by 31 MARCH 2017. Pro-
posals will be assessed by an independent STN Review
Panel appointed by the STN Committee following the
closing date and ensuring no conict of interest by panel
members. The STN Review Panel will make funding
recommendations to Council. The result will be an-
nounced after the next Council meeting, at latest on 31
August 2017.
The principal criterion for selection of an STN will be its
focus on an active area of research within the scope of
evolutionary biology. Preference might be given to STNs
that propose new connections between sub-disciplines
or that focus on the resolution of current controver-
sies. A score for this criterion based on part (1) of the
application will account for 50% of the overall panel
score. It is primarily for the proposers to demonstrate
the need for an STN, the potential for it to stimulate
progress and the activities that will enable the network
to be eective. A typical STN might organise one small
discussion meeting per year but it might also organise
training events and its members might work together to
generate resources or publications. Interaction among
members might be fostered, between meetings, using
social media, online discussion forums or similar. A
score for the eective and innovative nature of the plans
laid out in part (2) of the proposal will account for 25%
of the overall panel score. The nal 25% of the score will
be based on the budget and adherence to the following
guidelines:
1. A proposal should be supported by at least three
ESEB members (membership in date on the closing
date for applications), from at least two and typically
three countries and taking gender issues into account,
who commit to organising the STN for its duration (orApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 81
to nding appropriate replacements if forced to step
down). A member should support no more than one
proposal in a given application round and organisers of
current STNs should not be proposers of new STNs. 2.
STNs should organise at least one meeting in the non-
Congress year following its inception and one in its nal
non-Congress year. Complementing these meetings with
an innovative range of other activities is strongly encour-
aged. 3. STNs should consider oering a contribution
to the ESEB Congress in

PacBio Competition
BombardierBeetle
PacBio World's Most Interesting Genome competition
to dispel the myths of intelligent design.
I am writing for your support and vote to help us win
PacBio's World's Most Interesting Genome contest. My
team aims to unravel the mysteries of the explosive bom-
bardier beetle (Brachinus elongatulus), a species that
repels predators with rapid-re, precisely-aimed explo-
sive discharges of a toxic chemical mix at over 100 ^AoC,
earning them lead roles in media and culture. Yet the
genomic basis of this extraordinary ability remains a
mystery and bombardiers are currently being used as
prototypes of \intelligent design."
We propose sequencing the genome of the bombardier
beetle to generate a resource and model system for
insect chemical biosynthesis, ll a major gap in our
knowledge of the tree of life ( >40,000 species!), and
provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance under-
standing of biodiversity and evolutionary biology among
the general public. Although their explosive delivery is
well-documented, both scientically and in the popular
media (the combined view count for the top the ve
bombardier beetle YouTube videos is over 3 million!),
the genetic basis, evolutionary history, and biosynthesis
of defensive chemistry in bombardiers remain poorly
understood. The rst bombardier genome will allow us
to understand the genetic basis of bombardier chemical
production, solving a long-standing evolutionary puzzle.
Help Us Sequence The Explosive Bombardier Beetle
Genome.
Tanya Renner (San Diego State University) and team's
proposal to sequence the bombardier beetle's genome
has been selected as one of 5 nalists to undergo a
popular vote for the world's most interesting genome.
More than 200 proposals were submitted to the PacBio
2017 Plant and Animal SMRT Grant Program. The
nal winner is selected by popular vote. We need your

PacBio Competition PinkPigeon
Dear Members,
The endangered pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri) needs
your vote in the Pacic Biosciences competition.
The pink pigeon is an endangered species that declined
to less than 20 individuals in the 1970's and increased
to near 400 individuals currently. Although this is a
conservation success story, the pink pigeon is still endan-
gered, threatened by invasive pathogens, and suering
from inbreeding depression.
We (University of East Anglia, Earlham Institute and
our collaborators) hope to implement a genetic rescue
approach to help the species recover, in particular to
develop resistance to the pathogen Trichomona gallinae,
which kills over 60% of young. Transcriptome sequenc-
ing using Iso-Seq would enable us to identify candidate
genes that contribute to resistance so that we can begin
screening the captive population for these alleles.
Your vote for the pink pigeon will help us identify the
genes associated to resistance, which will help us to bet-
ter inform captive breeding programmes to safeguard
this important genetic variation and enable genetic sup-
plementation of the wild population in the future. This
research will also contribute to our understanding of
the evolution of the avian genome and the evolution of
immune gene regions.

Dear colleagues,
We need your voice! 3 times a day! 3 weeks long!
Why?
Elysia timida is a brilliant sea slug. It incorporates
chloroplasts (the energy-converting organelles inside the
cells of plants) from its food algae and lets them con-
tinue photosynthesis, almost like a plant! The starch
that the chloroplasts produce in the slug allows it to
survive during longer periods of starvation.
To better understand how the slug does this, we would
like to analyze the genome of Elysia timida, and have
submitted a proposal to an international competition
organized by PacBio (http://www.pacb.com). The
winners get their proposed genome sequenced (with
PacBio's latest SMRT technology) and assembled.
Our proposal has been selected by a group of experts
from more than 200 project ideas. Now we have to
compete against four other nalists.
That is why we need your vote!
How can you help us?
If you think that Elysia timida is an exciting animal and
want to know why it has these special abilities, please
go to the following website and vote for us:
http://www.pacb.com/smrt-science/smrt-grant/-

Darwinizing Gaia W. Ford Doolittle Dalhousie Univer-
sity Tuesday, March 28, 2017, 10:00 AM PDT
Talks in this series have largely focused on population
genetic and phylogenetic methods for reconstructing
micro- and macroevolutionary patterns consequent from
microevolutionary processes. When natural selection
is invoked, it is generally assumed to operate through
the dierential reproduction of favored variants among
populations of physical entities, be they genes, cells,
organisms or (rarely) species. The Gaia hypothesis of
James Lovelock, co-developed and vigorously promoted
by Lynn Margulis in the 1970s, has been very popular
with the lay public. But most mainstream Darwinists
scorned and still do not accept the notion. They cannot
imagine global biospheric stability being selected for
at any of the above levels, and do not see the Earth's
biosphere as part of a population of comparable global
entities engaged in reproductive competition. Most
philosophers of biology would similarly argue that any
global homeostatic systems (if they exist) can be only
\fortuitous byproducts" of lower-level selection. I will sug-
gest that we look at the biogeochemical cycles and other
homeostatic processes that might confer stability{ rather
than the individual organisms or \species" (mostly mi-
crobial) that implement them{ as the relevant units
of selection. By thus focusing our attentions on the
\song", not the \singers," a Darwinized Gaia might be
developed. Our understanding of evolution by natural
selection would however need to be stretched to accom-
modate dierential persistence, and our denition of
reproduction would need to be reworked.

Phylogenetic invariants: what are they and why should
we care Marta Casanellas Rius Universitat Polit ecnica
de Catalunya Wednesday, April 26, 2017, 10:00 AM
PDT
It has been now thirty years since the introduction of
phylogenetic invariants by Lake, Cavender, and Felsen-
stein. However, the use of phylogenetic invariants as
a method of phylogenetic reconstruction has been in a
dormant state for about 20 years; quoting J. Felsenstein
in his 2004 book \invariants are worth attention, not
for what they do for us now, but what they might lead
to in the future".
During the last decade many eorts have been made by
mathematicians to completely understand the structure
and use of phylogenetic invariants. This has led to the
characterization of dierent types of invariants for many
dierent models: from the most simple Jukes-Cantor
model to the general Markov model, and even mixtures
of them and the coalescent. Most importantly, this has
produced new and ecient methods of phylogenetic re-
construction for complex models. The use of invariants
has also been used in model selection and has been
crucial in proving the identiability of parameters for
certain models.
In this talk we shall introduce phylogenetic invariants,
explain the main ideas that underlie the methods of phy-
logenetic reconstruction based on invariants and discuss
the advantages and drawbacks of them.

PossibleGrants ForScienceExchange
Hi evoldir listers,
I'm excited to share with you that I have been se-
lected as one of 78 international female scientists to take
part in the second edition of Homeward Bound (http:/-
/homewardboundprojects.com.au/), a 10-year global
collaboration of women working together to communi-
cate climate science and gender equity on the world
stage. I'm the only representative of Venezuela and the
Caribbean in the program.
The Program covers 60% of the cost of my participation,
and I need to raise the remaining funds (US $16,000).
Raising funds from within Venezuela is a real challenge
for me, since the currency exchange control established
in 2003 by the government seriously limits Venezuelans
to obtain any kind of foreign currency.
I'm writing to the list in order to ask information about
grants or scholarships I could apply to get funds for my
participation in this initiative.
Also, I will really appreciate if people could share my
crowdfunding campaign in their social media. https://-

Pyrenees VolFieldAssist
PlantSpeciation
Nick Barton's group at the Institute of Science and Tech-
nology (IST) Austria requires volunteers to assist with
eld work on plant speciation in the Pyrenees (Spain)
this coming summer (late May - early August).
The project: We are studying the evolutionary dynam-ics underlying species diversication in the genus Antir-
rhinum (snapdragons). A major focus of this research
involves eld work on natural hybrid zones between two
subspecies with dierent ower colours. Most of the
eld work is contributing to a long-term pedigree project
aimed at establishing a direct link from genotype to phe-
notype to tness. With 20,000 samples collected over six
generations (so far), this provides an exciting and pow-
erful system to examine many outstanding questions in
speciation and quantitative genetics in wild populations.
We are seeking volunteers to assist with the eld work,
which involves working in teams mapping the location of
individual plants (GPS), tagging and sampling them for
leaves and owers, measuring quantitative traits, phe-
notyping them for ower pigmentation and processing
material for later DNA extraction. There may also be
opportunities to be involved in other projects we are
doing on plant-pollinator interactions, pollen fertility
and community ecology surveys. Most of the work is
outdoors, however we do spend some time indoors pro-
cessing samples. The work is highly team orientated,
typically in groups of 2-3 in the eld and larger groups
processing samples back at the research station. This
is a great opportunity for anybody looking to obtain
experience in eld work relating to evolutionary biology,
plant ecology and plant-animal interactions. You will
also be part of a large multidisciplinary team includ-
ing researchers from IST Austria (Vienna), John Innes
Centre (Norwich, UK) and the University of Toulouse.
The eld site is located near Ripoll in a beautiful part
of the Pyrenees of North Eastern Spain (Catalonia).
We stay in comfortable apartments overlooking a pic-
turesque valley, with close access to hiking trails and
small villages. All food, accommodation and travel
(within Europe) are covered. However, we cannot oer
any further stipend.
For these positions we are looking for hard working and
enthusiastic biology students with a strong interest in
working outdoors with plants. You must be meticulous
with recording data and also be comfortable working
as part of a team. Experience with eld-based projects
and plants is preferred but not essential.
We require assistance between late May and late July.
Depending on the year and the plants, we may extend
our time into August. Length of stay is exible but a
minimum stay of 3 weeks is required.
Please send any questions to the email address below.
How to apply? By the closing date of April 7th, please
send a statement of your background, CV, why you are
interested and the length of time you would be available

GroundSquirrel
Internship Description: We are looking for 4 interns
interested in taking part in a eld ecology project on
Columbian ground squirrels. Positions will begin on
May 15, 2017 and will nish on Aug 31, 2017. The
project investigates the ecology of Columbian ground
squirrels. As a member of the study, interns will be
involved with monitoring the phenology (when animals
emerge from hibernation), reproduction and survival
of individuals. Fieldwork will involve live-trapping and
handling of animals, radio-telemetry, behavioural obser-
vation and assistance with the measurement of phys-
iological (metabolism) traits on free-ranging animals.
This is an excellent opportunity to gain training and
experience working with a collaborative research team
on a long-term study of a wild mammal. Opportunities
for independent research projects are also available.
All eldwork is carried out in the spectacular Rocky
Mountains of southwestern Alberta, Canada, home to
some of the most majestic wildlife in North America.
Interns will have the opportunity to interact with, and
learn from, other researchers working with ground squir-
rels on a diversity of projects in behavioural and popula-
tion ecology. Additionally, a number of other researchers
in the area are studying a range of species, from insects
to large mammals.
International applicants: We welcome applications from
all individuals. If applicants are not Canadians or perma-
nent residents, there is the opportunity to enter CanadaApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 89
and complete the internship as a Visiting Research Stu-
dent. To be eligible for this program, you must be an
undergraduate student, a graduate student, or be in
between degrees (e.g., following graduation from a bach-
elors degree and looking to pursue graduate school). As
part of this program, applicants will be registered at
the U of S in a non-credit activity and it is expected
that you will gain a demonstrable educational benet
from being involved. We are particularly interested in
applicants who wish to use this opportunity to pursue
an independent research project. Applicants are eligible
for this program for a maximum of 6 months per 12
month period. Application forms and information are

Volunteer TeachingEvolutionInNepal
Dear Sir-
Could you please spread this message to those that are
interested?
We are looking a long term volunteer to serve in ru-
ral areas of Nepal to teach primary level students in
one of the Government school. The volunteer teacher
may choose teach science(including evolution), English,
Math or their subject of interest starting from April 1
or later, 2017.
The school has not any other source of funding to sup-
port the teacher at the moment. The upcoming teacher
may come with their own support(some philantrophic
or own). Living cost here is expected to be less than 50
U $$/Month.You may choose to live in Tamang community (learn
their ethnic language), do some treks in world famous
mountain in this small tiny country located between
India and China during holidays. Those who are look-
ing to work in stress free environment and interested in
doing something new, it will be a great opportunity.
Enthusiasts can often do research in their own time,
write their scholar activities like books, papers etc.
Some of the great question could be asked such as what
is DNA lineage and SNPs in these community , if one
has facility (lab test, or analysis) to do research besides
teaching for their thesis or publications.
Please contact me for further arrangements.

and Conservation Genetics, i.e. to apply molecular ge-
netic tools to solve problems in sheries science and
conservation biology in order to contribute to long term
sustainable management of marine resources and biodi-
versity. Our project portfolio ranges from basic science
to projects directly targeted at providing specic man-
agement advice, and most projects encompass both
basic and applied aspects. In recent years the group's
main focus has shifted from genetics to genomics. Thus,April 1, 2017 EvolDir 93
most ongoing projects include genomic analysis. The
facilities in Silkeborg comprise a fully equipped state of
the art genetics laboratory, including DNA lab facilities
for manipulating sensitive DNA samples.
The DTU Aqua Silkeborg location currently employs
around 35 people including six PhD students. The
young researchers work on a diversity of projects related
to sh ecology and genetics aiming at sheries resource
management and biodiversity protection. They actively
interact through various fora including regular seminars
and the local study group in population ecology and
genetics.

DukeU
SpeciationGenomicsBioinformatics
The Yoder Lab at Duke University seeks to hire a se-
nior postdoctoral research scientist interested in the
genomics of speciation.
The project is focused on an evolutionary radiation
of small nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar,
the mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus). These primates
constitute something of a classic \cryptic" species radia-
tion in that they are highly similar morphologically and
ecologically, but strongly diverged genetically and geo-
graphically. Whereas only two species were recognized in
1992, that number has grown to 25. Research questions
focus on understanding the phylogenomic relationships
among species, the levels of genomic divergence that sep-
arate them, the levels of gene ow (if any) among them,
and the underlying genomic signatures that dene them
and perhaps maintain their species identity. Of par-
ticular interest is the question of \what are the forces
of selection (sexual and/or natural) that might have
driven their diversication and maintain their species
identity?"
At present, genomic resources relevant to the project
include a high-coverage and near-chromosome level as-94 EvolDir April 1, 2017
sembly of one species within the radiation (the \gray
mouse lemur," generated in collaboration with the Bay-
lor College of Medicine, Human Genome Sequencing
Center), low coverage ( ~20X) genomes of ten other in-
dividuals within the species complex, low coverage (6 -
30X) genomes of ten additional species within the genus,
and eld samples for another ve to ten species. In
collaboration with investigators Alison Richard, Laurie
Godfrey, and Emilienne Rasoazanabary, we are stewards
of a large collection of wild-caught samples ( >200 indi-
viduals) of the reddish-gray mouse lemur collected from
the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve a population that
may be in the earliest stages of ecological speciation
in sympatry. Finally, via the captive collections of the
Duke Lemur Center, and in collaboration with investi-
gators at the Brunoy Centre National de la Recerche
Scientique, we have access to biological samples from
thousands of individual gray mouse lemurs now living,
or preserved, from fty years of captive management.
The main duties of the researcher will be managing, pro-
cessing, and analyzing next-generation sequence data,
generating high-quality genome assemblies, subsequent
population/speciation genomic analysis, database or-
ganization, and most importantly, shared intellectual
leadership of the project aims and publication of the
results. There will be some molecular lab work, though
the research will be largely bioinformatic. The ideal
candidate will have experience working with genomic
and population genetic data, a strong publication record,
and ideally, demonstrated grant-writing skills. More-
over, the candidate will be highly organized, mature,
enthusiastic, motivated, with plenty of esprit de corps
and joie de vivre!
Starting salary will be in the range of $50K - $60K,
dependent on skills and experience. The position is
guaranteed with seed funds for two years (assuming a
successful rst-year review), with continuation possible
through successful grant acquisition.

DiseaseGenomics
The Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at
Harvard Medical School and the Farhat Lab are looking
for a Postdoctoral Fellow in infectious disease genomics.
Pathogens display a remarkable range of variability in
phenotypes relevant to disease including transmissibility,
organ tropism, and antibiotic resistance. Elucidating
the biological mechanisms for these dierences is a fun-
damental question in the study of infectious diseases
and creates new avenues for surveillance, diagnosis and
personalized treatment. The heritability of disease phe-
notypes within pathogen species and their evolution
over generations indicates that they should be geneti-
cally encoded. As a result, the study of pathogen whole
genome sequence (WGS) data is expected to further
our understanding of these traits. The Farhat lab was
one of the rst to use phylogenetic convergence to test
for association between genes and the drug resistance
phenotype on a genome wide scale, and is continuing
in this path for both methodological development and
application to large scale datasets.
Responsibilities
The Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for devel-
oping and applying computational methodologies to
identify novel infectious disease genomic markers.
Basic Requirements
We are an interdisciplinary lab. Candidates may have
an MD or PhD degree in epidemiology, bioinformatics,
computational and evolutionary biology, biostatistics,
or a related eld. Experience with genomics is a must.
The candidate interested in this position must be highly
motivated and demonstrate initiative in assigned tasks.
Due to funding mechanism requirements this position
is restricted to US citizens or permanent residents.
Additional Requirements
Experience in programming R, Python, and/or Perl
and statistical analysis or at least an interest in learn-
ing these skills will be necessary. The candidate and
PI can work together to delineate the fellow's training
needs and develop a program to fulll this, utilizing the
department and university's wide range of resources.

PostDoctoral Positions in Turtle Molecular Cytogenetics
and Bioinformatics
Postdoctoral positions are available to work in the labo-
ratory of Dr. Nicole Valenzuela at Iowa State Univer-
sity on NSF-funded projects to study the evolution of
genomes and dosage compensation in turtles.
These projects combine molecular cytogenetics, bioinfor-
matics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and phylogenetic
analyses. The successful candidates will have the op-
portunity to contribute to one or more of these areas,
leveraging and augmenting turtle genomic resources.
*Project description:
Species with sex chromosomes face the challenge posed
by dierential gene dosage between XX and XY in-
dividuals (or ZZ and ZW) that may lead to disease,
suboptimal phenotypes or death. Dosage compensation
is a mechanism to equalize the activity of X- or Z-linked
genes between sex chromosomes and autosomes, and
between males and females. As part of this NSF-funded
project we are leveraging the multiple independently-
evolved sex chromosome systems found in turtles to
study the evolution of dosage compensation.

We invite applications for a postdoctoral research po-
sition to study visual mate recognition and speciation
in *Heliconius *butteries with Dr Richard Merrill's
research group at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at, Mu-
nich, and in close collaboration with the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute in Panama. The position
is funded by the DFG Emmy Noether program, and is
initially available for 2.5 years, with a further 2 years of
funding available dependent on progress and interests.
The position should start on 1 June 2017 or as soon as
possible thereafter.
The project is focused on understanding the genetic
basis and evolution of dierences in mate recognition
between divergent *Heliconius *taxa. *Heliconius* but-
teries are well known for their bright warning patterns,
which are also used as a mate recognition cue. The
genetic basis of the colour pattern cues is now known inApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 97
fantastic detail; however, we still know relatively little
about the genetic basis of the corresponding preference
behaviours.
The postdoctoral researcher will be primarily based at
the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama,
working in close collaboration with Dr Owen McMillan's
research group. The rst major aim of the project is to
develop methods to eciently quantify visual attraction
behaviours, using automated video analyses. By com-
bining these methods with genetic crosses and genomic
techniques the postdoctoral researcher will then investi-
gate the genetic basis of visual preference behaviours in
*Heliconius.*
Both at LMU (http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de) and STRI
(http://www.stri.si.edu), the postdoctoral researcher
will be part of vibrant international communities of
scientists. In addition, the researcher will join a collabo-
rative and driven community of *Heliconius *biologists.
Applicants should have a PhD, completed or completion
imminent, in evolutionary biology/genetics, behavioural
ecology, or a related eld. Experience of behavioural
analyses would be desirable. Candidates are expected
to work collaboratively, within the group and across
the community more generally, and to take an active
role in the supervision of students and management of
insectaries. Enthusiasm, determination and the capacity
to work independently are essential.

Postdoc position - \Evolutionary adaptation and physi-
ology of biological clocks"
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen,
Germany
The Max Planck Research Group \Biological Clocks"
aims to uncover the yet unknown molecular basis of
circalunar clocks, using the intertidal midge Clunio mar-inus (Diptera) as a model. Clunio times its life cycle
to the rhythm of the tides by circalunar and circadian
clocks. As the tides dier along the coastline, the clocks
of Clunio populations are genetically adapted to the
local pattern of the tides. We study these adaptations
using a combination of evolutionary genomics and molec-
ular biology, behavioral experiments and ecological eld-
work. We have shown that this approach enables the
identication of new clock molecules (Nature 540,6973).
Clunio's circalunar clock can be set by moonlight, as
well as mechanical cues and temperature cues associ-
ated with the tides. The postdoc will work with Clunio
strains that are insensitive to mechanical and moonlight
cues and use them to identify the receptors responsible
for setting the circalunar clock.
The ideal candidate holds a PhD in Biology with a strong
background in neurobiology, behavioral physiology or
molecular biology. Experience in receptor physiology,
immunohistochemistry, genome editing or cell culture
are great assets. The postdoc will participate in the ge-
nomic work related to the project. As a central member
of the group, the postdoc has good communication and
organizational skills and will take part in supervising
students. The position will be oered for 2 years with

Abstract of the ANR funded project
The number of worldwide problems related to inva-
sive species, which are largely due to human activities
(development of international trade and intercontinen-
tal transportation), has strongly increased in the last
decades. Invasive species are generally considered as
having a negative eect both on economy (crop dam-
age and health problems) and environment (loss of bio-
diversity). Managing and controlling invasive species
requires an understanding of the ecological and evolu-
tionary processes that underlie invasions. On a more
academic side, biological invasions represent \natural
experiments" for evolutionary biologists and are thus
ideal to study the genetic bases of adaptation. In this
project, we will investigate the evolutionary processes
at play during a biological invasion with a particular
focus on the mechanisms of adaptation. We will also
infer the evolutionary potential in this species, so as
to make short-term and longer-term predictions with
respect to adaptation. This project will be carried on
an Asian drosophila species (Drosophila suzukii, aka
the Spotted Wing Drosophila ) that has recently in-
vaded both Europe and North America. Unlike most
Drosophilids D. suzukii uses a sclerotized ovipositor to
lay eggs in unripe fruits causing dramatic losses to the
fruit industry, with a yearly cost estimate exceeding
one billion euros worldwide. The rapid dissemination of
D. suzukii in North America and Europe demonstrates
its remarkable ability to adapt or acclimate to new en-
vironments. We propose to: (1) quantify phenotypic
variation among and within populations, using quanti-
tative genetics and reaction norms; (2) investigate the
associated molecular variation using genomics and tran-
scriptomics approaches; (3) combine phenotypic and
molecular approaches to better investigate the traits
associated with the invasion success, study the relative
importance of natural selection and genetic drift on
phenotypic dierentiation between native and invasive
populations, and to analyze the role of transposable
elements in adaptation; (4) investigate how phenotypic
plasticity, micro-evolution and symbionts contribute to
the capacity of D. suzukii to feed on many dierent
crop species and therefore switch hosts within a year.
The strength of this project lies in several points: i)
the complementarity of the approaches (molecular and
phenotypic), ii) the skills of the partners on both the
methods/technics (including the development of newApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 99
inferential methods of general interest for the statistical
analysis of populational pangenomics data) as well as
the concepts that will be used, iii) the good knowledge of
the biological model that has been the subject of several
publications of the partners, iv) our collection of popula-
tion samples from all around the world that has allowed
to obtain valuable and original results on the routes
of invasion of this species, v) an existing collaborative
network with various socio-economic partners that will
allow a rapid and ecient transfer of knowledge.

Montpellier SelectionDetection
Post-doc position: Detection of selection from temporal
population genomic data
We seek a post-doctoral researcher to work in a project
on statistical population genomics. One of the goals
of population genetics is understanding the biological
processes (migration, selection, etc.) that inuence the
genetic diversity of populations. To this end, model-
based statistical inference is often used to characterize
these forces from genetic data. Of particular interest are
data of genetic diversity taken at several time points,
which allow to track genetic changes through time and
are more informative about the processes acting on the
population. The amount and nature of the genetic data
have changed with the advent of high throughput se-
quencing technologies. Thus, new statistical approaches
are required to analyse population genomic data. The
post-doc will evaluate the use of random forests on
the approximate Bayesian computation framework for
tackling the analysis of population genomic data. The
objective of the project will be to provide a statisti-
cal framework to co-estimate demography and selection
from time-series population genomic data. The methods
developed will be applied to one or more data sets from
organisms of agronomic interest (e.g. agricultural pest
Drosophila suzukii, wild crop relative Medicago truncat-
ula or poplar rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina;
data already available).
The ideal candidate will have a PhD in population ge-netics with an interest in statistics and computing or,
alternatively, a PhD in statistics with a strong inter-
est in biology and genetics. Programming skills are
required, at the very least with R, but ideally with
other languages (such as C or Python). Experience
with simulation-based work or approximate Bayesian
computation is recommended. The candidate should
have good skills in written and spoken English to be
able to communicate the results of his/her work.
The postdoc will be based at the CBGP laboratory
(Montpellier, France) working under the supervision of
Miguel Navascu es (population geneticist at the INRA)
in collaboration with Jean-Michel Marin (professor of
statistics at the University of Montpellier). The postdoc
will work in an interdisciplinary environment within
a group of researchers working on the development of
statistical methods for the analysis of population ge-
netic data. Montpellier is one of the main research
poles in France in evolutionary and computational bi-
ology. It is a medium-size city in the south of France,
with an animated student life and near natural sites on
the Mediterranean coast and the Cevennes mountains
National Park.

POSTDOC POSITION Genome Regulatory Network
of Sexual Dimorphism: Development and Evolution
A postdoctoral position is available in the laboratory of
Prof. David Fitch at New York University (Greenwich
Village, New York City) to study how morphogenesis is
regulated to occur in the appropriate time, place and sex
in males of Caenorhabditis elegans and related nema-
todes. Sexual dimorphism of tail tip morphogenesis has
evolved convergently in several lineages of nematodes re-
lated to C. elegans and oers a powerful genetic/genomic
system for dissecting this process at a very ne scale.
One goal is to use genomic-level (e.g. ChIP-seq) and
single-cell transcriptomics methodologies already estab-
lished in the lab to delineate gene expression dynamics
of male tail morphogenesis in C. elegans and related
species. From these data, we would like to infer the
architecture of the genetic regulatory network (GRN)
controlling this process and eventually reconstruct its
evolution in convergent lineages. Ultimately, such data
are required for addressing if and how GRN architecture
canalizes evolutionary change, as well as for understand-
ing how sexual dimorphism originates.
The Fitch lab is a part of the Biology Department at
NYU, and has access to a full range of facilities for the
project, including access to a genomics/bioinformatics
core facility, high-resolution microscopy, laser microdis-
section, the NYU Rhabditid Collection (over 150 dier-
ent species of nematodes related to C. elegans), culture
facilities, and standard molecular biology and genetics
facilities. The postdoc will join a community of otherC. elegans biologists, enjoying access to their collective
wisdom and resources. The department and school also
maintain excellent mentoring programs for postdocs,
who have multiple opportunities for participating in the
vibrant academic environment of NYU and the city in
which it resides.
Funding is currently available for a two-year period,
with the opportunity to be extended into subsequent
years. Prior experience in C. elegans genetics and molec-
ular biology is preferred. Knowledge regarding bioin-
formatics analyses and tools is advantageous. Appli-
cations will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the
position is lled. Please send CV and contact informa-
tion for at least two people who can serve as references

eukaryote plankton ecology and evolution in the Global
Ocean .
We invite applications for a 2 years postdoctoral fellow-
ship to analyze large scale metagenomics and metatran-
scriptomics eukaryotic data from the Tara Oceans and
Tara Oceans Polar Circle expeditions.
*PROJECT*: Plankton communities are composed of
viruses, bacteria, protists and multicellular eukaryotes
that all together perform biological and geochemical
processes important for global earth and climate reg-
ulations. The Tara Oceans and Tara Oceans Polar
Circle expeditions have systematically sampled marine
plankton at hundred sites of the world's oceans, cov-
ering the entire ecosystem diversity from viruses and
prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and generating the largest
standardized eco-morpho-metaomics dataset available
(>40 Terabases), including over 1,000 virus-, prokaryote-
, and eukaryote-enriched metagenomes and metatran-
scriptomes, as well as 4 billion eukaryotic and prokary-
otic metabarcodes from 3,000 size-fractionated plankton
communities worldwide. This dataset covering global
geographic and taxonomic scales represents a unique
opportunity to explore the boundaries of a planetary
ecosystem at the interface between oceanography, biodi-
versity, ecology, and evolution. The selected candidate
will investigate and compare meta-transcriptomics and
meta-genomics data at the organismal level to exploreresponses to population and environmental changes in
the whole set of sampled locations.
*CANDIDATE*: The successful candidate should have
a PhD in the elds of bioinformatics or environmental
genomics. The following expertises would be favored: i)
extensive rst-hand experience in computational anal-
ysis of biological sequences (particularly: population
genetics, meta-omics mining), ii) prociency in statis-
tical methods using R, or iii) demonstrated script pro-
gramming skills in *NIX environments (Perl, python,
shell etc.) as well as familiarity with the use of com-
pute farms. Knowledge of numerical ecology approaches
and/or oceanography will be very favorably considered.
*APPLICATION*: Applications and informal
queries should be addressed to Eric Pelletier
(eric.pelletier@genoscope.fr). Interested candi-
dates should send their CV with a publications list,
and a cover letter describing their research interests
and motivation. Candidates should also arrange for
at least two referees to e-mail recommendation letters

Review of applications will begin on March 1st, 2017
and applications will continue to be accepted until the
position is lled.
*CONTRACT AND ENVIRONMENT*: The position
will start at the earliest possible date, taking into ac-
count that drafting the work contract usually takes at
least 8 weeks. The salary will be 2,700 ~3,000 euro , based
on the CEA salary grid, and depends on qualications
and experience. The position is based at Genoscope
near Paris and will involve close national and interna-
tional collaboration in particular with other partner
institutions of the Tara Oceans consortia. The selected

SouthAfrica eDNA
We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to work on
eDNA of marine and estuarine communities in South
Africa, in particular characterising the communities
associated with seagrass meadows. This is part of a
National Research Foundation funded project on eDNA,
hosted in the lab of Prof. Sophie von der Heyden
(www.vonderheydenlab.com), in collaboration with the
Molecular Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Lab at Ban-
gor University (http://mefgl.bangor.ac.uk/sta/si.php).
The primary focus of this research project is to use an
environmental DNA metabarcoding approach to charac-
terise known and hidden genetic diversity in a variety
of marine ecosystems in South Africa, to not only allow
comparison between sites, but to 1. assess this method-
ology as a tool for monitoring change in African marine
ecosystems and 2. utilise seascape genetic approaches
to help disentangle the biological drivers of community
structuring.
Applicants must have evidence of working with eDNA,
including the necessary skills for the collection of sam-
ples, isolation of DNA, subsequent PCRs and relevant
bioinformatics skills. A proven track record of pub-
lications in international journals is a must. Ideally,
the candidate would be familiar with southern African
marine systems, but this is not essential. This is an
exciting opportunity for someone looking to work in one
of the most biodiverse and beautiful parts of the world
as the project will cover much of the ~3600km of coast-
line that South African has to oer. Good people skills
are a must, as this project also supports postgraduate
students.
The tenure of the postdoc would be for two years (start-
ing date negotiable) or longer, depending on the avail-
ability of funds. The successful candidate will need to ap-
ply to the University of Stellenbosch Postdoctoral Fellow-
ship scheme (details available from PI von der Heyden)
and also apply to the Claude Leon Foundation for post-
doctoral support (http://www.leonfoundation.co.za/-

Postdoc and technician positions available to work on
experimental evolution of gene drives in yeast
Gene drives are technology that will potentially
transform our capacity to eliminate diseases like
malaria, extricate invasive species, and combat hunger.
The newest iteration of this technology incorporates
CRISPER/Cas9 into genetic elements that can transfer
from one copy of a chromosome to others. This prop-
erty allows the elements to defy Mendelian inheritance
and to drive through a population. As they drive, the
elements can carry benecial genes, such malarial re-
sistance alleles in mosquito populations. While gene
drives are powerful molecular tools, there are a number
of unknowns about their evolution and the evolutionary
pressures they impose on the genomes they are intro-
duced to. Will the elements evolve loss of function110 EvolDir April 1, 2017
mutations or others that cause unintended transfers,
will the drives impose selection on their host genomes
to coevolve, and will drive-induced mutagenesis alter
the target genome's evolutionary trajectory? Sergey
Kryazhimskiy and Justin Meyer's labs at UC San Diego
will begin to answer these questions using experimental
evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This project will
be part of a larger active genetics initiative at UCSD
and the creation of the Tata Institute for Genetics and
Society on campus and in India. Two positions are
available, a postdoc and technician, that will begin in
June of 2017. Please e-mail Justin, jrmeyer@ucsd.edu

joining this important and groundbreaking work. Ideal
candidates will have experience with yeast genetic engi-
neering, genomics, and evolutionary theory.

EvolutionaryNeurobiology
Postdoc in brain evolution in butteries
We invite applications for postdoctoral Research Asso-
ciate position in the Department of Zoology in Central
Cambridge on Downing Street with Dr Stephen Mont-
gomery's research group. It is funded for up to 12 month
and should start on 1 June 2017 or as soon as possible
thereafter.
The PDRA will study the cellular basis of evolved dif-
ferences in mushroom body size across Heliconius but-
teries and their closest relatives. We have recently
conrmed previous reports that Heliconius have evolved
massively expanded mushroom bodies (see Montgomery
et al. 2016 J. Comp. Neurol. 524 (9):1747-1769; and
Merrill et al. 2015 J. Evol. Biol. 28(8): 1417-1438 for a
wider review of Heliconius behaviour), providing a novel
case study for investigating the causes and consequences
of volumetric expansion of 'higher order' brain regions.
We are interested in understanding the cellular basis
of mushroom body expansion by investigating how the
number of neurons and synaptic complexes co-evolve
with size, and by testing the hypothesis that mushroom
body expansion co-evolves with changes in input to the
mushroom bodies from other brain regions.
The successful applicant should have a Ph.D., completed
or completion imminent, in comparative neurobiology,
evolutionary biology cell/developmental biology or a re-
lated eld, and a strong interest in brain and behavioural
evolution. Candidates should have a good collaborative
spirit, and can expect a high degree of support and
assistance from the PI. Enthusiasm, determination and
the capacity to work independently are also essential.

A position is open for a NERC-funded postdoctoral re-
search associate based within the Department of Plant
Sciences at the University of Cambridge, and super-
vised by Professor Beverley Glover in collaboration with
Professor Allan Ellis (University of Stellenbosch).
The appointee will investigate the ecological, population
genetic and molecular developmental processes that gen-
erate and maintain oral variation and lead to incipient
speciation in the South African daisy Gorteria diusa.
In this project we aim to understand how morphological
variation within a species is produced genetically, how
variation is aected by natural selection resulting from
ecological context, and how such variation is maintained
when varieties meet. We are particularly focused on
the insect-mimicking spots found on the ray orets of
Gorteria diusa.
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To describe the evolutionary patterns underpinning
morphologically distinct populations by character map-
ping oral traits and the genes underlying them onto
our established phylogeny of the system.
2. To determine the ecological causes of intraspecic
variation in targeted oral traits through eld studies in-
cluding reciprocal transplant experiments and analyses
of ecological context.
3. To determine the evolutionary processes maintaining
intraspecic oral variation by investigating barriers to
hybridization.
4. To determine the molecular developmental pathways
that allow oral variation to evolve, using comparative
transcriptomic approaches to identify genetic regulators
of petal spots.
We are looking for a highly motivated post-doctoral
scientist to work in this area. The successful candidate
must be able to demonstrate a strong background in the
evolution and development of owering plants, including
a PhD in a relevant area. Experience with molecular
genetic, systematic and developmental techniques will
be necessary, along with prior experience of ecological
techniques.112 EvolDir April 1, 2017

3-year Postdoc, Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance In-
stitute of Biology, Leiden University, The Netherlands
A 3-year Postdoc position is available in my lab at the
University of Leiden in The Netherlands. This JPI-AMR
(Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resis-
tance) funded project will study the structure, causes
and consequences of collateral sensitivity (CS) networks
for antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
The project is part of an international collaboration
between experimentalists and theoreticians, with labs in
Norway (Pal Johnsen and Pia Abel zur Weisch), Sweden
(Dan Andersson) and Denmark (Niels Frimodt-Moller).
Collateral sensitivity between a pair of antibiotics occurs
when a mutation causing resistance to one antibiotic
increases susceptibility to another. Across multiple an-
tibiotics, CS networks dene how resistance mutations
for any given drug inuences the response of a bacte-
rial strain to exposure to a suite of alternative agents.
By understanding these responses at a phenotypic and
mechanistic level, CS networks can be used to make
rational and informed decisions about drug choice and
dosage that can suppress the emergence and spread of
de novo resistance, and also potentially arrest the trans-
mission of pre-existing resistance in clinical isolates.
The postdoc will identify CS networks for both chromo-
somal and horizontally acquired resistance for Strepto-
coccus pneumoniae, a gram-positive pathogen responsi-

Researcher in Developmental Biology and Evolution
A three year position as Researcher in Developmental
Biology and Evolution is available at CEES, Depart-
ment of Biosciences. The researcher will be part of the
MOLBAR project (The molecular basis of postzygotic
hybridization barriers in plants) lead by Professor Anne
Brysting and Professor Paul Grini, where the main goal
is to elucidate the molecular basis of postzygotic hy-
bridization barriers in plants. The candidate will work
in close collaboration with the PIs and the rest of the
international project team, which includes molecular-,
developmental- and evolutionary biologists, representing
a diverse array of expertise ranging from phenotypic
developmental analysis and the epigenetics of genomic
imprinting to molecular systematics and speciation the-
ory. The position will be aliated to the Centre for Eco-
logical and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES) and Section
for Genetics and Evolutionary Biology (EVOGENE) at
the Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo. The
appointment is for a period of three years. The Research
Council of Norway nances the project. The candidate
should be able to ll the position by the project start
01.08.2017 (given funding from the RCN).
Location The University of Oslo is Norway's oldest and
highest rated institution of research and education with
28 000 students and 7000 employees. Its broad range
of academic disciplines and internationally esteemed re-
search communities make UiO an important contributor
to society. The Centre for Ecological and Evolution-
ary Synthesis (CEES) is a Centre of Excellence (CoE)
based at the Department of Biosciences, University of
Oslo. CEES combines a broad spectrum of disciplines
(population biology, genomics, statistics, mathemati-
cal modelling) to foster the concept of ecology as adriving force of evolution via selective processes, with
a corresponding inuence of evolutionary changes on
ecology. CEES has over 160 members (Professors (20),
postdocs/researchers (45), PhDs (25), Master's students
(25) and technical and administrative sta) and many
guest researchers. The members represent 30 nation-
alities and constitute a vibrant and creative research
environment. CEES coordinate several international
networks. The budget = 150 million NOK (about 50
externally funded research projects). CEES is chaired
by Professor Nils Chr. Stenseth.
Project description The evolution of reproductive isola-
tion is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. Plant
species are typically isolated by dierent pre- and postzy-
gotic barriers in potentially complex interactions. Much
progress has been made in characterizing individual
components of reproductive isolation but still the evo-
lutionary forces responsible for development of postzy-
gotic barriers are virtually unknown. The aim of the
MOLBAR project is to elucidate the molecular and phe-
notypic basis of postzygotic hybridization barriers. Our
approach is unique as it integrates detailed observation
of embryo and endosperm development in hybrid seeds
with identication of genes and mechanisms responsible
for the barrier. To test our hypotheses, we will cross
species within two Brassicaceae genera (Arabidopsis
and Draba), look for similar patterns of aberrant seed
development and relate these to underlying imprinting
programs and gene networks. As part of the experimen-
tal setup, we will 1) characterize seed developmental
phenotypes of postzygotic barriers in crosses between dif-
ferent species, dierent ploidy levels and cryptic species;
2) characterize maternal and paternal expression pat-
terns in hybrid seeds using mRNA-seq; 3) determine
imprinting status of selected candidate genes; and 4)
integrate the results to improve our common knowledge
on one of the core issues in evolution - the underlying
causes of the evolution of reproduction barriers, and
thus speciation.
Requirements The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural
Sciences has a strategic ambition of being a leading
research faculty. The candidates for research fellowships
will be selected in accordance with this, and expected
to be in the upper segment of their class with respect to
academic credentials. The main purpose of research fel-
lowships is to qualify researchers to work in top academic
positions within their disciplines. Applicants must hold
a PhD-degree in Biology (or other corresponding edu-
cation equivalent to a Norwegian doctoral degree) and
additionally have post-doctoral or researcher experience.
In particular, research experience in both molecular
plant developmental biology and plant evolution will
be preferred. The ideal candidate must have hands onApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 119
experience working with dierent species and ploidies
within the Draba or Arabidopsis genera, experimental
experience in genetic and phenotypic analyses of plant
reproduction, and experience with the analysis of ge-
nomic imprinting. We are seeking a highly motivated,
enthusiastic and hard-working

Postdoctoral Opportunity
Parasitic Puppeteers - How do They Pull the Strings?
We are currently seeking an outstanding postdoctoral
researcher with interests in genetics, evolution and par-
asitology to spearhead a new project to investigate the
molecular mechanisms through which parasitic worms
alter the behaviour of their insect hosts.
The position is funded by a grant from the Royal Society
Marsden Fund and is available with an immediate start
through to 29/2/2020.
Project Description: Parasites can have profound eects
on the animal hosts they invade, manipulating host bi-
ology with exquisite precision to enhance host-to-host
transmission. One of the most extraordinary of these
host manipulations is the water-seeking behaviour that
some nematodes and hairworms induce in their hosts
so that the worms might exit the host and reproduce.
The process is the stu of science ction; the worm
hijacks the host's central nervous system forcing it to
seek water. Once water is found the adult worm, often
many times the size of the host, emerges, sacricing the
host. This amazing alteration in behaviour is induced by
parasitic worms spanning two phyla (Nematoda and Ne-
matomorpha) and is observed in a variety of arthropod
hosts, notably crickets, weta, earwigs, and sandhoppers,
leading us to hypothesise that a common and conserved
mechanism is being utilised by the parasites to induce
this behaviour in their hosts. Here we propose to couple
eld and laboratory studies of two phylogenetically dis-
tinct hosts and their parasites, with powerful genomic
and bioinformatic comparisons to elucidate the trig-
ger and genetic cascade through which these parasiticpuppeteers elicit this highly conserved, yet astonishing
behavioural response.
The project emerges from a new Marsden Grant headed
by Professor Neil Gemmell (Anatomy) in collaboration
with Professor Robert Poulin (Zoology) and will be
based in the Gemmell laboratory at the University of
Otago.
The Ideal Candidate: will possess experience in molecu-
lar genetics/genomics, evolutionary biology and bioin-
formatics. Knowledge of NGS approaches and analyses
is essential, while past work in comparative genomics
and an interest in parasitology and neurobiology may be
helpful. The successful candidate will be motivated and
organised, with a demonstrated capacity to master the
broad skill set necessary for the successful completion
of a research project. They will be collegial and able
to work alongside a wide variety of people. In addi-
tion they will have a strong commitment to research
excellence with a track record of high research produc-
tivity based on international, peer-reviewed publications
commensurate for their career stage.

to make informal enquiries to Professor Neil Gemmell.

Full time, Fixed term for up to 3.5 years Closing date
for applications: 10 April 2017
Description The Fraser lab is looking for a postdoc with
experience in population genomic analysis to work on a
project investigating balancing selection in the Trinida-
dian guppy. Accounting for high genetic diversity in
ecologically-important traits is a fundamental problem
in evolutionary biology. Recent work implicates an ad-
vantage to rare types as a critical factor maintaining
variation in the Trinidadian guppy, but we have little un-
derstanding of how this process actually unfolds in the
wild. Using natural populations, laboratory lines, and
closely related species, we will use whole-genome DNA
sequencing to identify genes that show signatures of bal-
ancing selection and are linked to highly polymorphic
traits.
The main duties of the postdoctoral researcher will be
processing and analyzing next generation sequence data,
including quality control, mapping reads, calling SNPs,
and population genetic analysis. There will be some
molecular lab work (constructing genomic libraries) and
potentially eld work in Trinidad. The ideal candidate
should have experience working with genomic data andApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 121

tion as independent infectious units. However, recent
work by us and others indicates that viruses are often
transmitted as more complex structures, such as virion
aggregates, lipid vesicles or protein matrices harbour-
ing multiple infectious particles. This demonstrates
that viruses can be transmitted as \collective infectious
units", in contrast with the current paradigm. Criti-
cally, these recent discoveries now set the stage for the
evolution of social interactions, a previously unappre-
ciated facet of viruses. We propose to investigate how
collective infectious units drive virus social evolution
using state-of-the-art tools from the elds of virology,
genetics, structural biology, and nanotechnology. The
eects of collective infectivity on viral tness will be
tested directly using experimental evolution and genetic
engineering, and conrmed in vivo. Three widely dier-
ent viruses will be used to achieve generality: human
enteroviruses, a vector-borne rhabdovirus, and a bac-
ulovirus. Furthermore, the implications of virus social
interactions for the maintenance of genetic diversity,
evolvability, virulence evolution, and the emergence of
drug resistance will be investigated. New processes such
as the putative extracellular fusion of viral particles will
be also explored. We expect that infectious units consti-
tuted by viruses from dierent species will be uncovered
as well, with far-reaching implications for epidemiology.
It is becoming increasingly recognized that parasite so-
ciality is a disease determinant, and our results may
therefore inspire new antiviral strategies. Beyond their
practical importance viruses will also provide a simple
and tractable system that will help us to establish more
general principles of social evolution.

\Early-environment eects: Towards integrating theoret-
ical and empirical approaches"
Workshop, 18-21 July 2017, Arolla, Switzerland
Organizer: Barbara Taborsky
A workshop of the CUSO 'Doctoral Program in Ecology
and Evolution' (DPEE)
There is ample evidence that the environment organisms
experience during early development can shape their
phenotype for lifetime, and that these early environment
eects can even be transmitted across generations. In
the past two decades the eld of early environment ef-
fects was dominated by empirical research. Recently an
exciting body of theoretical work has started to emerge
modelling how direct environmental, epigenetic and ge-
netic information shapes the phenotypes of developing
organisms. Although, opposite to other areas in biology,
this novel theory is developed in close exchange with
empiricists, phenotypic development is still modelled at
a high level of abstraction ignoring the architecture of
the physical substrate of development. This workshop
shall focus on eects of early experience on phenotypic
development in general, and the development of an-
imal behaviour in particular. It will bring together
researchers of function and mechanisms of early environ-
ment eects with theoreticians modelling these eects.
Invited speakers will give lectures about their eld of
expertise (behavioural ecology, cognition, psychology,
theory and molecular brain mechanisms) followed by
joint discussions with the participants in small working
groups. Questions discussed will involve, among others,
which kind of theory is required to aid the conceptualdevelopment of future empirical research and, in turn,
which kind of data are needed to enhance the develop-
ment of more predictive theory. Further we will ask how
to integrate molecular, neurological and psychological
mechanisms in theoretical models. A nal discussion will
collect the ideas of all participants on these questions.

The workshop takes place at the Grand-H0tel 'Kurhaus'
in a breathtaking scenery amidst some of the nest
mountain peaks of Switzerland. The venue is situated
above the picturesque mountain village of Arolla, at
2100 m sea level in the very heart of the Swiss high alps.

Berlin AdvancedPython Nov13-17
Advanced Python for biologists
13-17 November 2017, Berlin (Germany)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course12/
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
Biologists)
http://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/ Reg-
istration deadline: 20th October 2017
Overview
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at people who already have a
basic knowledge of Python and are interested in using
the language to tackle larger problems. In it, we will
look in detail at the parts of the language which are
particularly useful in scientic programming, and at the
tools Python oers for making development faster and
easier. The workshop will use examples and exercises
drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics work. Af-
ter completing the workshop, students should be in a
position to (1) take advantage of the advanced language
features in their own programs and (2) use appropriate
tools when developing software programs.
Who should attend
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a basic knowl-
edge of Python. The Advanced course is aimed at people
who want to develop bigger or more complicated pro-
grams in Python, or to learn more about the language,
or to explore dierent approaches (object-oriented, func-
tional) to programming. The material covered is very
general purpose and can be applied to any kind of prob-
lem.
Requirements
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein ac-
cession number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence
is). They should also have basic Python experience
(the Introduction to Python for Biologists course will
full these requirements). Students should be familiar
with the use of lists, loops, functions and conditions in
Python and have written at least a few small programsfrom scratch.
Session content
Monday 13th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1: Data structures in Python
In this session we will briey recap Python's basic data
structures, before looking at a couple of new data types
tuples and sets and discussing where each should be
used. We will then see how we can combine these basic
types to make more complex data structures for solving
specic problems. We'll nish our discussion by looking
at specialized data types that are found in the Python
core library. This session will also be our rst intro-
duction to benchmarking as we talk about the relative
performance of dierent data types. In the practical
session we'll learn how to parse an input le into a com-
plex data structure which we can then use to rapidly
query the data. Core concepts introduced: tuples, sets,
higher-order data structures, default dicts, Counters,
big-O notation.
Session 2: Recursion and trees
In this session we will cover two very closely related
concepts: trees (i.e. the various ways that we can store
hierarchical data) and recursive functions (the best way
to operate on treelike data). As recursion is inherently
confusing, we'll start with a gentle introduction using
biological examples before moving on to consider a num-
ber of core tree algorithms concerning parents, children,
and common ancestors. In the practical session we'll
look in detail at one particular way of identifying the
last common ancestor of a group of nodes, which will
give us an opportunity to explore the role of recursion.
Core concepts introduced: nested lists, storing hierar-
chical data, recursive functions, relationship between
recursion and iteration.
Tuesday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3: Classes and objects
In this session we will introduce the core concepts of
object-oriented programming, and see how the data
types that we use all the time in Python are actually
examples of classes. We'll take a very simple example
and use it to examine how we can construct our own
classes, moving from an imperative style of program-
ming to an object-oriented style. As we do so, we'll
discuss where and when object-orientation is a good
idea. In the practical we will practise writing classes to
solve simple biological problems and familiarize ourselves
with the division of code into library and client that
object-oriented programming demands. Core concepts
introduced: classes, instances, methods vs. functions,
self, constructors, magic methods.126 EvolDir April 1, 2017
Session 4: Object-oriented programming
Following on from the previous session, we will go over
some advanced ideas that are common to most object-
oriented programming languages. For each idea we'll
discuss the basic concept, the scenarios in which it's

Dear all,
We have still a few places available for the \Data anal-
ysis in high throughput biology https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses/course3/ " workshop, which will
run from the 29th of May to the 2nd of June 2017 in
Berlin, Germany (https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses/course3/).
Registration deadline: April 24th, 2017
Instructor: Dr. January Weiner (Max Planck In-
stitute for Infection Biology; https://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t14/).
Course overview
High throughput (HT) techniques such as transcrip-
tomics or metabolomics are of great signicance in many
areas of biology. With the standard techniques becoming
more aordable and new techniques being introduced
all the time, the amount of data sets generated is stag-
gering. However, statistical and computational analysis
of HT data sets present many challenges. In this course,
the students will gain the ability to independently pro-
cess and analyse HT data sets, select the appropriate
tools, functionally interpret the results as well as learn
the paradigms of computational biology and statistics
which will allow them to eciently communicate with
computational biologists.
Intended audience
In general, the course is aimed at biologists who would
like to take their data analysis in their own hands. While
an aptitude for computational work is necessary, the
main goal of the course is the application of biologicaland statistical knowledge to HT sets with as little eort
as necessary.
* basic computer skills (a rudimentary knowledge of pro-
gramming principles in any language is recommended,
but not mandatory) * basic understanding of statis-
tics * basic understanding of molecular techniques for
generating high throughput data
The students should be comfortable with using a com-
puter and have at least a rudimentary understanding of
computer programming. However, no specic skills are
necessary; the students will learn basic R programming
in this course.
Basic skills in statistics are necessary. The students
should understand the concepts of statistical hypothesis
testing and p-values. However, an in-depth introduction
to these concepts will also be provided.
Target student skills
* overview of commonly used high-throughput data types
* techniques for data clean-up and preparation for anal-
ysis * understanding of computational problems associ-
ated with high- throughput data analysis * statistical
problems and solutions in analysis of HT data * practical
skills in analysis methods of HT data: * basic dierential
analysis (limma, DESeq, alternative and non- paramet-
ric techniques) * set enrichment techniques (GSEA, gene
ontologies, metabolic proling and more) * multivariate
approaches to data analysis (PCA / ICA, PLS, multiple
correspondance analysis) * basic approaches in machine
learning: cross * Communication skills in statistics and
computational biology
After the course, the student should be able to pre-
pare, analyse and interpret a HT data set, including
multivariate and machine learning techniques.
Teaching format
On each day, the course will consist of four parts:
* Lecture: theoretical introduction to the days focus *
Hands-on guide: guided practical session in R where
students replicate the analysis performed by the teacher.
While the lecture is general, here specic R techniques
and R packages are introduced * Guided self-study: stu-
dents are given excercises and problems to solve and
work on them individually under the guidance of the
teacher * Individual project work: each student will
receive a transcriptomic (RNASeq or microarray) data
set to analyse throughout the course * Lecture: wrap-
up and side notes; preparation for the following day *

=== Topic =Evolution by natural selection has shaped
life over billions of years leading to the emergence of com-
plex organism capable of exceptional cognitive abilities.
These natural evolutionary processes have inspired the
development of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), which
are optimization algorithms widely popular due to their
eciency and robustness. Beyond their ability to opti-
mize, EAs have also proven to be creative and ecient
at generating innovative solutions to novel problems.The combination of these two abilities makes them a
tool of choice for the resolution of complex problems.
There is evidence that the principle of selection on vari-
ation is at play in the human brain, as proposed in
Changeux's and Edelman's models of Neuronal Darwin-
ism, and more recently properly reformulated in the
theory of the Neuronal Replicators. Consequently, the
idea of an interaction between evolutionary processes
and cognition over physiological time scales has been
gaining some traction. Since the development of hu-
man cognition requires years of maturation, it can be
expected that articial cognitive agents will also require
months if not years of learning and adaptation. It is in
this context that the optimizing and creative abilities of
EAs could become an ideal framework that complement,
aid in understanding, and facilitate the implementation
of cognitive processes. Additionally, a better under-
standing of how evolution can be implemented as part
of an articial cognitive architecture can lead to new
insights into cognition in humans and other animals.
The goals of the workshop are to depict the current
state of the art of evolution in cognition and to sketch
the main challenges and future directions. In particular,
we aim at bringing together the dierent theoretical and
empirical approaches that can potentially contribute
to the understanding of how evolution and cognition
can act together in an algorithmic way in order to solve
complex problems. In this workshop we welcome ap-
proaches that contribute to an improved understanding
of evolution in cognition using robotic agents, in silico
computation as well as mathematical models.

Workshop title: Genomic Data Visualization and Inter-
pretation (https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/-
course14/)
Course Details:
Topic: Advanced R and bioinformatics applications for
visualization and interpretation of genomic data.
Length: 5 days ( ~9.30 AM to 5.30 PM with breaks)
Instructors: Drs. Obi Grith, Malachi Grith,
Zachary Skidmore (McDonnell Genome Institute; http:/-
/genome.wustl.edu/people/groups/detail/grith-lab/)
Anticipated participants: max 30.
Dates: 11th-15th September
Course overview
The advent of rapid and relatively cheap massively par-
allel sequencing has dramatically increased the availabil-
ity of genome, transcriptome, and epigenome proling.
Analysis workows and published best practices are
also now available to process raw sequence data into
alignments, variant calls, expression estimates, etc., in
relatively standardized le formats. Interpretation and
visualization of these data, often consisting of thousands
to billions of data points, and extracting biological mean-ing remains a serious challenge. In this workshop we will
explore a number of best-in-class visualization tools, and
provide working examples that demonstrate important
principles of 'omic interpretation strategies.
Workshop format
The workshop will be delivered over the course of ve
days. Each day will include an introductory lecture with
class discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each
day will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These
sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring
exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as
well as applying these skills on your own to complete
complete individual exercises. After and during each
exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a
group. Computing will be done using a combination of
tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and
web resources accessed via web browser.
Who should attend
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers who are analyzing some kind of omic data (e.g.
WGS, exome, RNA-seq, variant les, etc.). Examples
demonstrated in this course will involve primarily human
genome/transcriptome data but many of the concepts
learned will be applicable to model organisms, metage-
nomics, simulated data, etc.
Requirements
Attendees should have a background in biology and
a basic knowledge of R. We will dedicate one session
to a brief R/linux primer. Attendees should have also
some familiarity with genomic data. The course will
teach relatively advanced usage of R (especially ggplot2
and Bioconductor packages). Attendees should have a
working installation of R and RStudio on their laptop.
Example data
Attendees will learn to visualize and interpret results
from real human genome data sets generated at the
McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University
School of Medicine. These data will be analyzed to de-
termine previously known as well as potentially novel in-
terpretations. Since the example data are not simulated
or arbitrarily ltered, interpretation and visualization
will be performed in the context of representative levels
of sequence error, and other sources of technical and
biological noise.

Berlin Metabarcoding Apr3-7 3
Dear all,
There are the last 2 places left for the \16S rRNA
gene Metabarcoding" workshop, 3-7 April 2017 in
Berlin (Germany).https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses/course8/ Registration deadline: March 3rd,
2017
Instructor: Dr. Alexandre de Menezes (National
University of Ireland Galway) https://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t5/ Course overview
The 16s rRNA gene has become the standard marker for
prokaryote phylogenetic analysis, and combined with
high-throughput sequencing technologies it is widely
used to infer the structure and composition of microbial
communities. Due to the continuous improvements in
sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, there
is a wide choice of methods for sequencing and analysing
16S rRNA gene assemblies. This workshop is designed
to give students the necessary background and prac-
tical experience of the strategies for the analysis of
the diversity and structure of prokaryote communities,
covering i) experimental design and primer choices; ii)
wet-lab and library preparation options; iii) sequence
quality control and analysis and iv) statistical analysis
of microbial community data. The many sequencing
and analysis options will be discussed, whereas a more
in-depth tutorial using real sequence data will provide
an opportunity for the student to practice 16S rRNA
sequence analysis from raw sequence les to ecological
interpretation. Course material, such as presentation
slides and necessary model data, will be provided to the
students.
Targeted audience and assumed background
This workshop is intended for students and researchers
interested in microbial ecology but who are not yet very
familiar with the techniques involved. Choosing the ap-
propriate primers, library preparation kits, sequencing
methodologies and bioinformatics pipelines can be quite
daunting to the uninitiated. This workshop will allow
researchers interested more condence in their method-
ology and analyses choices. The target audience include
students of animal or plant microbiomes as well as those130 EvolDir April 1, 2017
studying environmental microbial communities. It is
assumed that the workshop attendees are interested in
performing 16S rRNA metabarcoding using the Illumina
MiSeq platform, although other sequencing technologies
will be discussed during the workshop.
Knowledge of Linux and R or familiarity with work-
ing in the command line will be helpful, but for those
new to the area detailed instructions will allow stu-
dents to follow the workshop. Students will need to
have a computer running either on Linux or a Linux
virtual machine running on MacOX/Windows com-
puters. Contact the instructor at ademez@gmail.com
mailto:ademez@gmail.com if in doubt about computa-
tional requirements.
Workshop structure
The workshop will consist of both lectures and practical
classes. Background information will be provided to
help workshop attendees choose the appropriate experi-
mental design, primers, sequencing library preparation
kits and to contextualise the bioinformatics and sta-
tistical analysis methods. Practical tutorials will be
conducted on a step-by-step basis to guide the student
from when receiving data from a sequence provider to ob-
taining plots and tables describing microbial community
diversity, structure and relationships to environmental
variables or host data.

Session contents
Monday 3rd-Classes from 10:00 to 18:00
Session 1: the 16S rRNA gene
The use of the 16S rRNA gene as a marker for prokary-
ote phylogenetics will be discussed to introduce the
students to the concept of conserved and hypervariable
regions. The student will learn about the history of this
molecular marker and why it is the choice for prokaryote
diversity studies. The primer combinations used to tar-
get the dierent hypervariable regions will be discussed,
as well as what is known regarding their advantages
and disadvantages. The pros and cons of PCR-based
16S rRNA gene sequencing versus PCR-free shot-gun
metagenomics will also be discussed.
This session will also include an overview of current se-
quencing technologies, and the Illumina MiSeq platform
will be contrasted with other sequencing technologies
(Ion Torrent, MinIon, PacBio and Moleculo).
Session 2: sequencing experimental design and initialhands-on exercises
Focusing on the MiSeq platform, experimental design
considerations will be discussed and topics discussed
will include sequence depth, replication, contamination
and the use of appropriate controls and mock communi-
ties. Other topics that will be taught include: metadata
collection, DNA extraction and RNA-cDNA sequenc-
ing. Demo sequence data will be used to check that the
appropriate tools are installed correctly

Berlin PythonForBiologists Oct2-6
Introduction to Python for biologists
2-6 October 2017 in Berlin, Germany (https://-
www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course2/) Instructor:
Dr Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists: https:/-
/www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/)
Application deadline is: September 2nd, 2017
Overview:
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at complete beginners and as-
sumes no prior programming experience. It gives an
overview of the language with an emphasis on practical
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn
from various aspects of bioinformatics work. After com-
pleting the workshop, students should be in a position
to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackling
problems in their own research and (2) continue their
Python education in a self-directed way. All course
materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared by
the instructing team) will be provided electronically to
participants.
Intended audience:
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previousApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 131
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. If in doubt,
take a look at the detailed session content below or
drop Martin Jones (martin@pythonforbiologists.com)
an email.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background:
Students should have enough biological background to
appreciate the examples and exercise problems (i.e. they
should know about DNA and protein sequences, what
translation is, and what introns and exons are). No
previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary,
but you'll need to have a laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum:
Monday 2nd - From 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1-. Introduction
In this session I introduce the students to Python and
explain what we expect them to get out of it and how
learning to program can benet their research. I explain
the format of the course and take care of any housekeep-
ing details (like coee breaks and catering arrangements).
I outline the edit-run-x cycle of software development
and talk about how to avoid common text editing er-
rors. In this session, we also check that the computing
infrastructure for the rest of the course is in place (e.g.
making sure that everybody has an appropriate version
of Python installed). Core concepts introduced: source
code, text editors, whitespace, syntax and syntax errors,
Python versions.
Session 2-Output and text manipulation
In this session students learn to write very simple pro-
grams that produce output to the terminal, and in doing
so become comfortable with editing and running Python
code. This session also introduces many of the technical
terms that we'll rely on in future sessions. I run through
some examples of tools for working with text and show
how they work in the context of biological sequence
manipulation. We also cover dierent types of errors
and error messages, and learn how to go about xing
them methodically. Core concepts introduced: termi-
nals, standard output, variables and naming, strings
and characters, special characters, output formatting,
statements, functions, methods, arguments, comments.Tuesday 3rd - From 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3-File IO and user interfaces
I introduce this session by talking about the impor-
tance of les in bioinformatics pipelines and workows,
and we then explore the Python interfaces for reading
from and writing to les. This involves introducing
the idea of types and objects, and a bit of discussion
about how Python interacts with the operating system.
The practical session is spent combining the techniques
from session 2 with the le IO tools to create basic le-
processing scripts. Core concepts introduced: objects
and classes, paths and folders, relationships between
variables and values, text and binary les, newlines.
Session 4. Flow control 1 : loops
A discussion of the limitations of the techniques learned
in session 3 quickly reveals that ow control is required
to write more sophisticated le-processing programs,
and I introduce the concept of loops. We look at the
way in which Python loops work, and how they can be
used in a

Aug11-23
Hi Colleagues,
This summer we're oering two workshops on the use of
high-throughput sequencing to study population genetic
variation and community diversity. For more details,
see this link or the description that follows.
http://people.oregonstate.edu/ ~ meyere/-
workshops.html We aim to train biologists with
little or no NGS experience to prepare sequencing
libraries and analyze the millions of DNA sequences
that result. Participants are expected to provide
DNA samples from their own study systems, and we
will prepare sequencing libraries together from those
samples as well as a shared set of samples for a group
project.
Participants will learn to analyze these data using simple
command line tools on a high-performance computing
cluster. Altogether, we'll cover the process from raw
genomic DNA in a tube, to millions of DNA sequences,
to biological data on population and/or community di-
versity.
Registration for these workshops covers room and board
(three meals a day, with ample coee and snacks) during
the workshop, and reagents/sequencing such that each
participant can sequence and analyze up to 10 of their
own samples.
For the 5-day amplicon sequencing workshop (Aug 11-
15), registration costs $1,300. For the 9-day 2bRAD
genotyping workshop (Aug 15-23), registration costs
$1,900. Participants enrolling in both workshops will
have the option of participating in a 'bonus' special
topics in bioinformatics session and pay a discounted
rate of $3,000 for both workshops.

Modeling is a key tool in the evolutionary biology tool
box, and helping students to develop modeling skills as
early in their career allows deeper exploration of evolu-
tionary concepts. At this summer's workshop we will
delve into how to engage our students more productively
with models and the process of modeling. Join us as
we consider how to enhance the skills students need
to understand and build models, how to expand upon
models already in our curriculum, and ultimately how
to enhance student understanding of the nature and
process of science with modeling. We will discuss eec-
tive pedagogical approaches, share excellent resources,
and build community around eective use of models.
The intensive week-long workshop is followed by the
opportunity to continue to work with colleagues on the
QUBESHub through the fall semester to develop and
implement new approaches or materials.
The summer workshop is appropriate for two and four
year faculty teaching all levels of undergraduate biology,
quantitative biology, and life science-oriented mathe-
matics. We encourage future faculty, full and part time
faculty and teams of faculty from the same or aliated
institutions to apply. Please share this information with
any of your colleagues who might be interested!

3rd Bringing Maths to Life 7-9 June 2017, Naples, ItalyApril 1, 2017 EvolDir 135
Deadline Extension: BMTL2017 Workshop
Dear Colleague,
We would like to invite you to the 3rd edition of
the Bringing Maths to Life Workshop, that will be
held in Naples on 7-9 June 2017 (http://www.bmtl.it).
NEW: ABSTRACTS SUBMISSION DEADLINE EX-
TENSION 15th APRIL 2017
The workshop provides an occasion for biologists and
mathematicians to join forces in addressing key ar-
eas in biology that face demanding mathematical chal-
lenges.Discussing existing cases to identify gaps or to
share existing solutions should help these disciplines in
successfully linking up.
BMTL 2017 workshop, as a melange of dierent elds,
will consist of selected contributions for open discussion
to present and confront the most updated results at
the interface of mathematics and biology in three main
sessions:
1) Data: acquisition, pre-processing and storage of dif-
ferent -omics datasets. The goal of this session is to
discuss eective ways of acquiring, processing, and stor-
ing data as a starting point for any kind of analysis.
Two large-scale projects will be presented within this
session. The rst project, SardiNIA, recruited over 1.5
million Sardinians across the island to gather enough
cases and controls to investigate genetic factors for a
wide range of conditions and diseases (see: https://-
sardinia.nia.nih.gov/). The second, MetaSUB (Metage-
nomics & Metadesign of Subways & Urban Biomes),
includes scientists tracking the microbes in city subways
and describe their diusion on an interactive map (see:
http://metasub.org/).
2) Information: data analysis, novel -omics technolo-
gies, the application of deep learning to dierent -omics
datasets. The integration of experimental data prior to
their analysis requires full understanding of the algo-
rithms that need to be used in order to ensure a correct
application in answering biological questions. Case stud-
ies of this session are two examples of metagenomics
analyses. The rst is the analysis of data collected
during the Tara Oceans expedition including samples
from 210 stations across the world oceans (see: http:/-
/taraexpeditions-it.blogspot.it/)). The project is deci-
phering how the most complex organisms evolved from
primordial bacteria and in future it will tell us about
the fate of the myriad organisms present today. The
second concern the analysis of human gut microbiome.
3) Knowledge: integration of dierent -omics data, sys-
tem biology of -omics data. Methods for the integrative
analysis of multi-omics data are required to draw a more
complete and accurate picture of the dynamics of molec-ular systems. Unveiling the interactions between diverse
types of data allows to fully exploit their information.
The keynote lectures of this session will show the in-
tegration of genomic, biochemical, and metabolic data
under comprehensive mathematical models. This year
the workshop will be held in the magnicent Capitolo
Hall of St. Domenico Maggiore Convent, one of the
most important spaces created during the renovation
started by the prior Ruo (XVII century).

Scientists are invited to send their contributions. Ab-
stracts should be in English and contain original research
results. All abstracts will be peer reviewed by the in-
ternational scientic board that will decide whether
presenting them as a poster or an oral contribution.

University, to coincide with the North American Evolu-
tion meetings (SSE/ASN/SSB) in Portland (June 23 -
June 27). The workshop is funded in part by the Na-
tional Science Foundation with additional support from
Oregon State University and is co-organized by Dr. Dan
Rabosky (University of Michigan) and Dr. Brian Sid-
lauskas (Oregon State University). Travel awards of up
to $500 per person are available to cover participation
costs.
Overview: Rates of speciation, extinction, and pheno-
typic evolution vary widely across the Tree of Life and
through time. This workshop will provide theoretical
background and a hands-on practicum in the analy-
sis of lineage diversication rates using time-calibrated
phylogenetic trees. Topics will include:
Working with phylogenies in R Theoretical foundations
of diversication models Developing your intuition for
diversication models Using BAMM to study complex
patterns of diversication rate variation on phylogenies
Testing hypotheses about trait-dependent diversica-
tion Assessing the reliability of inferences with BAMM
and other methods Visualizing macroevolutionary dy-
namics on phylogenies Studying diversication rates on
phylogenies that include fossils
Course will primarily be taught by Dan Rabosky (Uni-
versity of Michigan) with contributions from severalco-instructors. The course will assume basic prociency
with the R programming/statistical environment and
some familiarity with command line interfaces. Example
datasets will be provided, but participants are encour-
aged to bring any phylogenetic dataset they wish to
analyze (time calibrated phylogenetic trees). A personal
laptop is essential.
Workshop participants will arrive in Corvallis (Oregon)
any time on Wednesday June 21 and we will depart for
Portland on the evening of Friday June 23, such that
individuals can attend the Evolution meeting. Shuttles
oer easy transport between the Portland Airport and
OSU's campus every two hours, and housing is available
at several hotels near campus. Details regarding accom-
modation and transport will be provided to successful
applicants.

Course Natural History Collections and Biodiversity
Organized by Maria Judite Alves, Raquel Barata, Cris-tiane Bastos-Silveira et al. jMay 29 - June 2 @ Lisbon,
Portugal
Objectives Natural history museums are privileged
spaces for seminal research on dierent subjects of bio-
logical sciences such as biodiversity, evolution, ecology,
biogeography and taxonomy. This crucial role is due to
the fact that they represent biological diversity reposi-
tories becoming huge libraries of information on Earth
living organisms. The long-term sampling through var-
ious decades renders to natural history collections an
historic perspective that allows reconstructing a \mem-
ory", sometimes secular, of natural patterns and pro-
cesses. This aspect gains particular relevance nowadays
because of the increasing rate of species extinctions and
biodiversity decrease.
This course aims to: - evidence the importance of nat-
ural history collections for the study of biodiversity. -
show new tools and approaches to extract and dissemi-
nate biodiversity data from natural history collections -
increase awareness of young researchers for the scientic
and culture value of Natural History Museums.

Siegen Germany FishSim
AnimationToolchain Oct20-22
Workshop announcement: \Discovering FishSim in 3
days - new software for computer-animated 3D sh stim-
uli for innovative research in animal behavior"
When? October, 20th - 22nd 2017 Where? University
of Siegen, H olderlinstr. 3, 57076 Siegen, Germany
Application deadline: Friday, 30th June 2017
BACKGROUND Scientists are continuously looking for
new methods to improve experimental procedures and
to pave new ways to study animal behavior. Nowadays,
more and more scientists tend to use various forms of
computer animations that assist in research and lead to
higher control and standardization during experiments.
Computer animations oer various opportunities for
specic manipulation of morphology and behavior of a
virtually created animal stimulus in a range not possi-
ble with live stimulus animals. Furthermore, computer
animations serve to implement the 3Rs principle in re-
search by replacing and reducing the use of experimental
animals and by rening experimental procedures. Cur-
rently, researchers can choose from a conglomeration
of software solutions to create and animate 2D and 3D
virtual stimuli. Nevertheless, easy-to-use toolchains that
are designed for the specic needs of behavioral biolo-gists and that combine all necessary steps, from creation
of the stimulus to its presentation, do nearly not exist
(but see anyFish; http://swordtail.tamu.edu/anysh).
Within the scope of the DFG funded Virtual Fish Project
at University of Siegen (Germany), we developed the
free and open-source \FishSim Animation Toolchain"
(FishSim) which combines easy creation, animation and
presentation of realistic 3D computer-animated sh stim-
uli for the use in experiments with live test sh ( uller
et al. 2016, doi: 10.1093/cz/zow106; Gierszewski et al.
2016, doi: 10.1093/cz/zow108). FishSim was specically
designed for behavioral experiments using common one-
choice and two-choice set-ups, as in studies on visual
signaling and mate choice. FishSim provides various
possibilities to experimentally manipulate morphology
and behavior of any number of virtual 3D sh with
presentation via monitors. Since FishSim is based on
a computer game engine, it oers a unique way for an-
imating 3D sh via real-time input from an external
video-game controller.
To introduce FishSim and to assist in the implemen-
tation of our toolchain, we would like to welcome you
to join a 3-day international workshop for behavioral
and evolutionary biologists on \Discovering FishSim in
3 days - new software for computer-animated 3D sh
stimuli for innovative research in animal behavior". The
workshop will be held at University of Siegen in Siegen,
Germany, from October 20-22, 2017, and is organized
by Dipl.-Biol. Stefanie Gierszewski (Institute of Biol-
ogy, University of Siegen), Prof. Dr. Klaudia Witte
(Institute of Biology, University of Siegen), Dipl.-Inform.
Klaus  uller (Institute of Real-Time Learning Systems,
University of Siegen) and BSc. Jan-Marco H utwohl
(Institute of Real-Time Learning Systems, University of
Siegen).
The goal of this 3-day workshop is to provide detailed
information on the free and open-source FishSim Ba-
sic and its integrated tools FishCreator, FishSteering
and FishPlayer in both theory and practice. DOs and
DON'Ts for implementation of FishSim Basic in future
research are discussed. Working computers with all soft-
ware installed will be provided but it is also possible to
use personal laptops. Assistance and advice for working
with own data will be given.

DESCRIPTION Sexual selection is expected to promote
population tness by enhancing the reproductive suc-
cess of individuals of high genetic quality (i.e. of high
breeding value for tness), or by purging the genomeof deleterious mutations, e.g. via mate preferences for
condition- ^A'dependent traits or dominance ghts within
sexes. The signicance of such eects is not suciently
understood yet. Estimates range from minor importance
to the benets of sexual selection even outweighing the
costs of sex. We will discuss the problem in the context
of current environmental changes and the potential of
rapid evolution.

uncovering genetic structures from usual genetic data
including most genetic markers (e.g. microsatellites,
SNPs, AFLP) and genetic sequences (DNA or amino-
acid). After covering dierent types of phylogenetic
reconstruction, and basic population genetics tests, astrong emphasis will be put on using factorial methods
(e.g. Principal Component Analysis) for investigating
genetic diversity. In particular, we will focus on the
identication and description of genetic clusters, and
on characterising spatial genetic patterns. The last
day of the course will be an open problem day, where
participants will be able to analyse their own data.
Day 1 Intro to phylogenetic reconstruction. Module
1a: Reconstructing phylogenies from genetic sequence
data. Three main approaches covered: distance-based
phylogenies; maximum parsimony; and likelihood-based
approaches. Module 1b: Short R refresher. Practical
1: Phylogenetic reconstruction using R. Three main
approaches plus rooting a tree; assessing/testing for a
molecular clock; and bootstrapping. Main packages:
ape, phangorn.
Day 2 Intro to multivariate analysis of genetic data
Module 2: Key concepts in multivariate analysis. Focus
on using factorial methods for genetic data analysis.

WoodsHole MolecularEvolution
Jul20-30
APPLICATION DEADLINE: April 7, 2017
Convening for its 30th year at the Marine Biological Lab
in Woods Hole, MA, the Workshop on Molecular Evolu-
tion will be held July 20-30, 2017. The Workshop is the
premier program for integrating the methods, theory,
and applications of molecular phylogenetics, statistical
genetics, molecular evolution, and related disciplines.
Students work closely with internationally-recognized
scientists, receiving (i) high-level instruction in the prin-
ciples of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics,
(ii) advanced training in statistical methods best suited
to modern datasets, and (iii) hands-on experience with
the latest software tools (often from the authors of the
programs they are using). The material is delivered via
lectures, discussions, and bioinformatic exercises moti-
vated by contemporary topics in molecular evolution.
A hallmark of this workshop is the direct interaction
between students and eld-leading scientists. The work-
shop serves graduate students, postdocs, and established
faculty from around the world seeking to apply the prin-
ciples of molecular evolution to questions of both basic
and applied biological sciences. A priority of this work-
shop is to foster an environment where students can
learn from each other as well from the course faculty.
As the course progresses, participants learn how to
use the following software to address questions con-
cerning the origins, maintenance, and function of
molecular variation: ASTRAL, BEAST2, BEST, BPP,
FASTA, FigTree, GARLI, MIGRATE, MAFFT, MP-
EST, RaxML, RevBayes, PAML, PAUP*, Phybase,
ipyrad and SVD Quartets. Students will have the op-
portunity to work with software on their own laptops as
well as receive training on how to use the same programs
on a high performance computer cluster.
Course instructors include Peter Beerli, Joseph
Bielawski, Belinda Chang, Mario dos Reis, Casey Dunn,
Deren Eaton, Scott Edwards, Tracy Heath, David Hillis,
Mark Holder, John Huelsenbeck, Lacey Knowles, Laura

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
