Beijing PlantSystematics July7-9
International Conference
New Frontiers in Plant Systematics and Evolution Bei-
jing, China July 7-9, 2010
FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT
Objectives Systematic biology faces tremendous chal-
lenges and opportunities at the present time. This
conference aims at providing an opportunity for plant
systematists and evolutionary biologists to review the
progress, evaluate the current status, and look into the
future of the ﬁeld. China hosts enormous plant diver-
sity that has supported its long history and continuous
advancement in studying plant systematics. With espe-
cially rapid progress made during the recent years, 2010
comes to be the time for China to invite colleagues from
the world to discuss the new frontiers of systematic bi-
ology. This would provide an ideal forum for Chinese
and international colleagues to present research results,
exchange ideas, discuss common interests, develop col-
laborations, stimulate young students, and move the
ﬁeld of systematic biology forward. The conference will
include talks, posters, and open discussions on recent
progress and future directions of the following areas: 1)
Taxonomy, collections, and databases; 2) Phylogenet-
ics, phylogenomics, and the Tree of Life; 3) Biogeogra-
phy and phylogeography; 4) Speciation, hybridization,
and adaptation; 5) Molecular evolution, evolutionarygenetics and genomics, and Evo-Devo.
Organizers Botanical Society of China (BSC) Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) International Association
for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT)

ability of natural populations. The ability to adapt to
changing ecological conditions and track environmen-
tal changes crucially relies on standing genetic variation
in the population and hence on evolutionary potential.
However, processes that maintain genetic variation in
natural populations are enigmatic and poorly under-
stood, and this constrains our ability to understand
population responses to environmental impacts.
For this meeting we bring together researchers with a
primary focus on evolutionary processes in wild popu-
lations and processes aﬀecting evolutionary potential.
We have organized three main topics that will be ad-
dressed:
1) Studying evolution in wild populations using molec-
ular and quantitative genetic tools. 2) Understanding
the processes that lead to loss / generate and maintain
genetic variation in natural populations 3) What con-
strains evolution in natural populations? ˆ a plasticity,
genetic and environmental constrains

background reading and submission of an essay will be
required to obtain 5 ECTS.
Funding: Funding from Nordic and EU sources are
available to cover full board and accommodation for the
conference, participants must cover travel costs them-
selves although we may be able to cover travel costs
for participants from the Nordic countries (through the
NordForsk program ˆ aNordic Network for Evolutionary
Conservation Biologyˆ a). Depending on the ﬁnal bud-
get and sources of funding priority might be given to
participants from countries contributing to the EU ESF
programme ThermAdapt and Nordic and Baltic coun-
tries.

Time schedule: Travel should be planned with arrival
during the afternoon/evening on 11 April. Dinner will
be provided on 11 April and the conference will end
after lunch on April 14.
Travel: The closest airport is the domestic S ˜Anderborg
Airport which can be reached from Copenhagen Air-
port. There are also train connections from Copen-
hagen Airport.
Billund Airport is relatively close and has many excel-
lent connections to European cities; you might consider
Billund rather than Copenhagen Airport. Another op-
tion is Hamburg Airport. We will try to arrange com-
mon pickup transportation from local airports.

Daphnia Genomics Consortium (DGC) Meeting 2010
When: 26th through 30th of March, 2010 Where: Leu-
ven, Belgium
Pre-registration and abstract submission is now open!
http://bio.kuleuven.be/DGCmeeting2010.html Early
registration and abstracts submission deadline is Jan-
uary 15, 2010.
Please register early, because space is limited to 120
participants.
Dear colleagues and friends,
We are pleased to invite you to the DGC Meeting 2010.
The Daphnia Genomics Consortium (DGC) is an inter-
national network of scientists with a common goal to
foster the freshwater crustacean Daphnia as a premier
model system for genomics in ecology, evolution and
the environmental sciences.
This meeting aims to bring together the members of
the consortium at large, to facilitate the exchange of in-
formation on recent developments and results obtained
from the ongoing investigations into the genome biol-
ogy of Daphnia. Additionally, we welcome researchers
working with Daphnia who are not yet DGC partici-
pants and researchers working with other model or non-
model organisms in the ﬁeld of ecological genomics.
The DGC meeting will have a signiﬁcant impact on the
future development of the research groups involved in
the consortium. By this time, we will have ﬁnalized our
initial investigations of the draft D. pulex genome se-
quence, and we will begin the work of exploring data ob-
tained from the D. magna genome sequencing project.
This upcoming meeting continues the tradition of also
promoting collaborations between researchers working
within related disciplines, including limnology, ecotox-
icology, quantitative and population genetics, system-
atics, molecular biology and evolution, developmental
biology, genomics and bioinformatics.
The meeting will have plenary lectures from keynote
speakers in several research ﬁelds related to Daphnia
and other model organisms. The symposia of our meet-
ing will touch on several research topics:
* Ecology and Evolutionary Genomics * Toxicology and
Environmental Genomics of Natural and Human Stres-
sors * Genotype by Environment Interactions * Com-
parative Genomics and Development * Gene Expression
and Gene Function
Plan to also learn about the latest open source bioin-
formatic and high-throughput research tools, includ-
ing databases, expression and genotyping microarrays,
mapping panels for trait locus mapping, molecular ge-netic protocols and services.
The venue is at the ﬁve century-old Katholieke Uni-
versiteit Leuven, in Belgium. Leuven is a beautiful me-
dieval town that combines a rich historical patrimonium
with a cheerful, ﬂourishing city culture and a creative
atmosphere for lively exchanges and debates.
We look forward to welcoming you in Leuven.

Integrating Genetic and Cultural Approaches to Lan-
guage - CEE 2010 Symposium Date: Friday, 26th
February 2010 (9am-5pm) Location: Queen Mary Uni-
versity of London
Please ﬁnd below details of a one-day symposium at
Queen Mary University of London.
Description: This symposium will ask how the diverse
and complex languages of today evolved from a non-
linguistic ancestral state, encompassing both genetic
evolution (of the language faculty) and cultural evolu-
tion (of languages themselves). Topics to be addressed
include comparative studies of vocal communication in
birds, ungulates and primates, the genetic and neuro-
biological basis of human speech and language, cogni-
tive inﬂuences on language evolution, and phylogenetic
analyses of language history.

Rome MolAnthroGenomics Dec3-5
Program
“Molecular Anthropology on the Genomic Era” - In-
ternational conference in Rome (Italy), December 3-5,
2009
Dear Evoldir Members,
the ﬁnal scientiﬁc program of the international confer-ence “Molecular Anthropology on the Genomic Era”
held next December (3-5) in Rome (Italy) is now avail-
able!
Among the speakers: Quentin Atkinson (UK), Guido
Barbujani (Italy), Francesc Calafell (Spain), Mark Col-
lard (Canada), David Comas (Spain), Daniel Falush
(UK), Claudio Franceschi (Italy), Mark Jobling (UK),
Connie Mulligan (USA), Martin Richards (UK), Jorge
Rocha (Portugal), John Novembre (USA)
Conference website: http://www.mnhn.fr/mnhn/-
ecoanthropologie/Rome2009/Rome index.html REG-
ISTRATION IS OPEN. See you in Rome!
The structure of the conference is to present state-of-
art research continent by continent since, as a matter
of fact, the research of many colleagues is geographi-
cally focused. Our objective is to contribute examples
and ideas that will drive further integration of molec-
ular anthropology and other research ﬁelds and disci-
plines. Particular attention will be given to the impact
of new analytical methods but also, and more tradi-
tionally, to updated and comprehensive syntheses about
human diversity, since browsing the ever growing liter-
ature requires an enormous time that acts as a barrier
among specialists of diﬀerent areas. The last day will
be devoted to human evolutionary research in an in-
terdisciplinary frame. Theories and approaches will be
discussed in a challenging way by putting face-to-face
molecular anthropologists and experts from other disci-
plines. We are putting much energy in organizing such
latter session since we would like to emphasize the dan-
gers of the hyper specialization mentioned above.

This is a one-day symposium.
Background: Divergence time estimation is an excit-
ing current area of interest, and we are seeing great
advances in both methodologies and taxonomic cover-
age. Research on arthropod divergences is vital due to
their extreme biodiversity and both ecological and eco-
nomic importance. Dating in arthropods can provide
insight into fascinating questions such as the timing of
the great angiosperm divergence, co-evolution of para-
sites and hosts, and a variety of other aspects of life on
earth, encompassing subject areas across anthropology,
vector biology, paleontology, geology and geography.
This workshop on molecular dating in arthropods in-tends to provide an opportunity to share new method-
ological advances, explore current results on taxa of
interest and provide interface time among fossil and
molecular researchers. The set up of this workshop is
speciﬁcally aimed to promote networking and collabo-
ration, with extended lunch and coﬀee times provided
for discussion.
We have a broad program of speakers, ranging from
molecular researchers to paleontologists, with a diverse
range of talks from organismal work to methodology.
Speaker line-up: Sarah Boyer, Sean Brady, Frank Bur-
brink, Seth Bybee, CJ Geraci, David Grimaldi, Akito
Kawahara, Karl Kjer, Jessica Light, Corrie Moreau,
Sergios-Orestis Kolokotronis, Chris Owen, Alex Py-
ron, Sara Ruane, Hojun Song, Gavin Svenson, Jessica
Thomas, Jessica Ware.

UAdelaide Phylogenetics Apr5-10
Adelaide Phylogenetics Conference April 12-16, 2010,
Port Elliot, South Australia
and the
Adelaide Phylogenetics workshop April 5 -10, 2010 Uni-
versity of Adelaide
The third annual Adelaide Conference on Phyloge-
netics (formerly Mathematical & Evolutionary Biol-
ogy) will be held on Port Elliot beachfront, South
Australia from April 12-16, 2010. This meeting fol-
lows the successful meetings held in Blanche Cave,
Naracoorte 2008 ( http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/-
events/biomaths08/ ) and Port Elliot 2009 ( http://-
www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/events/biomaths09/ ). The
Port Elliot meeting series aims to bridge the current gap
between evolutionary biologists and mathematicians in
Australia, and overseas, by providing a relaxed, infor-
mal setting (with just 50 attendees) to encourage the
discussion of new results and methods. The confer-
ence is designed to allow maximum student/academic
interaction, and contains a session on the analysis of
datasets during the meeting itself. The emphasis is on
the development and application of advanced new an-
alytical methods, and building trans-disciplinary col-
laborations. Topics covered at the previous meeting
include: Phylogenetics and Networks; Mathematical
methods and Algorithms; Macroevolution; Evolution-
ary rates and dates; Genome analysis; Bioinformatics;
Human evolution; Disease. (A full list of abstracts from
2008 and 2009 is available at the website above).
Conﬁrmed conference attendees include: Masami
Hasegawa, David Penny, Mike Hendy, Dave Bryant,
Mike Steel, Matt Phillips, Lars Jermin, Simon Ho, andworkshop presenters Alexei Drummond, Peter Lock-
hart, Christian Anderson, and Andrew Storfer.
The conference features one day devoted to data analy-
sis/recreation with scheduled activities around the Port
Elliot area including wine tours, beach activities, or op-
tional data analysis sessions. Important prizes at the
Port Elliot meeting include the highly coveted Napkin
Award (for the best mathematical solution to a biolog-
ical problem solved at the conference). Entries must be
submitted on the original napkin to allow artistic merit
to be considered. The winners of the 2008 award (Profs.
Allen Rodrigo and Nigel Bean) can be seen with their
entry here ( http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/events/-
biomaths08/ ). This year, a new award (’The Ashes’)
celebrating trans-Tasman phylogenetic rivalry will be
inaugurated, with an oﬃcial urn containing ashes of
actual Mike Steel lecture props used in Port Elliot in
2009.
We will also repeat the extremely successful Phyloge-
netics Workshop for graduate students, run prior to the
conference by the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA
at the University of Adelaide from April 6-10 (Easter
week). This small workshop (limited to 20 attendees)
features an intensive 5 day hands-on training from 4
international experts, in leading software packages for
the analysis of genetic data: Dr. Alexi Drummond
(BEAST), Prof. Peter Lockhart (Phylogenetic meth-
ods) Christian Anderson (Serial SimCoal), and Andrew
Storfer (Landscape Genetics). These leading experts
provide detailed instruction on the analysis of model
and actual datasets, and there is a strong demand for
places. Interested graduates are encouraged to apply
for travel funds from their host institutions. Work-
shop graduates are strongly encouraged to attend and
present in Port Elliot where they have free registration.
Please visit http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/-
events/phylo workshop10.html for further details. The
cost and program details of the above two events will
be posted shortly at http://www.adelaide.edu.au/-
acad/events/biomaths10/ . As spaces are strictly
limited early registration is strongly advised. –

Integrative Genomics is an interdisciplinary graduate
program that combines genomics, ecology, evolution,
and physiology to better understand the evolutionary
forces that have shaped the mechanisms that are im-
portant to species interactions in the wild. The pro-
gram is designed to provide those seeking a Masters
degree the necessary skills and concepts to work coop-
eratively with others in a research area that takes a
systems-wide approach and incorporates an organism’s
history and natural environment to understand organi-
zation and expression at the genomic level. Exposure
to modern techniques and instrumentation in the lab-
oratory and ﬁeld prepares students for success in both
academic and other biotechnology-related pursuits.
Integrative Genomics GAs receive an annual stipend
of $16,640 and additional funds for laboratory supplies
and expenses.

CarletonU EvolutionaryTheory
Graduate positions in evolutionary theory with Root
Gorelick, Carleton University (Ottawa, ON).
Funding for MSc and PhD students is available for
Canadian citizens and permanent residence to studyevolution of sex and origins of biodiversity (other candi-
dates would have to come with their own funding). Re-
garding evolution of sex, our current research includes
(1) testing ideas on epigenetic origins of sex as a modi-
ﬁcation of self sex, (2) explicating the fundamental dif-
ferences between females and males, (3) understanding
what exactly occurs in gynogenesis and how it evolved,
and (4) unraveling the steps by which syngamy may
have evolved from meiosis. Regarding evolution of bio-
diversity, we are researching (1) the diﬀerences between
two forms of polyploidy, genome duplication versus
chromosomal ﬁssion and (2) environmentally-induced
heritable epimutations. We are a theoretical lab, which
means formation of new hypotheses and conducting
meta-analyses to test these hypotheses. Ideas for re-
search in related subjects is truly welcome. Please see

nity Ecology and Landscape Genetics: Dr. Gina Wimp
is seeking students interested in understanding the
mechanisms that lead to the loss of biodiversity and
increased risk of extinction in fragmented habitats. Dr.
Wimp’s work takes place in the intertidal salt marsh
where a rise in mean tidal height over the past 60 years
has led to a change in the demography of the two domi-
nant grass species, with the more ﬂood-intolerant grass
(Spartina patens) contracting in size. She uses manip-
ulative experiments to examine the eﬀects of habitat
loss and fragmentation in S. patens on the abundance,
diversity and composition of the dependent arthropod
community. The Wimp and Hamilton labs have devel-
oped microsatellite genetic marker loci to examine the
eﬀects of habitat fragmentation on gene ﬂow in two of
the dominant herbivore species found in S. patens, both
of which are ﬂightless, specialist planthoppers. Inter-
ested students should contact Dr. Gina Wimp via email
(gmw22@georgetown.edu).
Applicants interested in pursuing graduate research in
community ecology will work with Gina Wimp ( http:/-

demonstrated interest in community ecology and/or
ecological genetics.
Mechanisms of phenotypic evolution: Dr. Peter Arm-
bruster seeks a highly motivated PhD student to join
his laboratory’s research on mechanisms of phenotypic
evolution in natural populations. The Armbruster lab
is currently focusing on the invasive and medically im-
portant mosquito Aedes albopictus. This mosquito in-
vaded the US in 1985 and spread rapidly over approxi-
mately 15 degrees of latitude. This natural experiment
in evolution provides an exciting opportunity to iden-
tify the molecular and physiological mechanisms under-
pinning climatic adaptation during invasion and range
expansion. Dr. Armbruster’s research is currently sup-
ported by grants from both NIH and NSF, and inte-
grates a broad range of approaches, including molecu-
lar biology, bioinformatics, physiology, and quantitative

Research in the Whitehead lab seeks to understand
how genomes integrate cues from, respond to, and are
shaped by the external environment. We examine ge-
nomic responses to stress that occur over physiological
timescales (acclimation responses) and over evolution-
ary timescales (adaptive responses). Many complemen-
tary approaches are integrated into our program, in-
cluding genome expression proﬁling using microarrays,
population genetics and phylogenetics, and physiology,
to study how individuals and species respond to and
adapt to environmental stress. Stressors of interest in-

EvolutionaryDynamics
PhD Student Position - Spatial Evolution in vitro and
in silico
A 3-year PhD student position is available in the newly
formed lab of Dr. Oskar Hallatschek at the Max-
Planck-Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in
G¨ ottingen. The student will join a young and interac-
tive research group in evolutionary dynamics and bio-
physics, including theoreticians and experimentalists.
We cultivate an international atmosphere and the ev-
eryday working language is English. The Max-Planck-
Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization is located
close to the center of the medieval town of G¨ ottingen.
More information about the group is available on the
web at: http://www.evo.ds.mpg.de Although spatial
degrees of freedom are an essential feature of most nat-
ural populations, they have been neglected in most ex-
perimental studies on microbial evolution. Yet, our pre-
liminary results indicate that spatially extended popu-
lations have a drastically diﬀerent mode and speed of
adaptation. To investigate these dynamics in detail,
the P.h.D. student will set up a long-term evolution
experiment in the lab (using microbial populations) as
well as on the computer. The goal is to work out the
diﬀerences in the evolutionary dynamics of well-mixed
populations and spatially extended populations. The
experimental results will be related to an existing long-

PhD Studentships (x2) - Microbial Genomics and Evo-
lution
The Rumen Microbial Genomics group in the Food,
Metabolism & Microbiology Section (FMM) is looking
for two PhD students in Microbial Evolutionary Ge-
nomics to take part in a Marsden-funded proposal in-
vestigating the eﬀects of air on evolutionary processes.
The students will be mentored by Dr. Christina Moon
and Dr. Sinead Leahy at AgResearch Grasslands in
Palmerston North, New Zealand, with academic super-
vision from Prof. Paul Rainey at the New Zealand In-
stitute of Advanced Study, Massey University, Albany
and collaboration with Dr. Rees Kassen at the Univer-
sity of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.
Mutations provide an important source of population
variation on which natural selection acts to enable or-24 EvolDir December 1, 2009
ganisms to adapt to new environments. The eﬀects
of aerobic (oxygen-containing) and anaerobic (oxygen-
free) environments on mutation types, and the rates
that mutations accumulate, are not well understood.
We plan to conduct a detailed investigation into how
aerobic and anaerobic environments aﬀect the funda-
mental processes of evolution (mutation and adapta-
tion) by examining the evolution of a model bacterium
in these environments, and assessing genetic changes
at the whole genome level to understand the biologi-
cal mechanisms that contribute to genetic diversity and
evolution.
The projects will involve the regular maintenance and
analysis of evolving lineages of bacteria, and next gen-
eration sequencing technologies coupled with bioinfor-
matic analyses to examine genomic and transcriptomic
changes. The persons best suited to these projects will
therefore have strong academic backgrounds in areas
such as bioinformatics, ecology, evolution, population
genetics, genomics, microbiology and molecular biology.
Although the two PhD projects are closely related, ide-
ally the two successful candidates will have particular
strengths in:
1: Molecular microbiology, genomics and bioinformat-
ics, and
2: Ecology, bioinformatics where some basic computer
programming skills will provide an advantage.
FMM has a proud history of completing PhDs. We of-
fer a stimulating research environment where the focus
is very much on people, science excellence and keeping
it ’fun’. Enquires are welcome from individuals whose
honours or masters degrees qualify them for admission
into PhD study.
These positions include a PhD stipend of up to
NZ$27,000 (tax free) per year for three years, plus tu-
ition fees, research expenses and opportunities to at-
tend conferences.

OklahomaStateUniv milkweed
phylogeny genomics
Mark Fishbein (Oklahoma State University, Depart-
ment of Botany) seeks a graduate student (PhD or MS)
to apply genomic approaches to the phylogeny of Amer-
ican milkweeds (Asclepias, Apocynaceae). The student
will participate in an NSF-funded collaborative project
with Dr. Aaron Liston and Dr. Richard Cronn at Ore-
gon State University.
Milkweeds have served as a important model system
for studies of the evolution of pollination systems and
plant defenses against herbivory. Continued phyloge-
netic study is required to fully resolve species level re-
lationships, to further test and expand upon theories of
coevolution of plants, pollinators, and herbivores, and
to develop milkweeds as a model system for the com-
parative study of genomes.December 1, 2009 EvolDir 27
Graduate research in the Fishbein lab may include
working with the complete genome of Asclepias syri-
aca (common milkweed) and chloroplast genomes from
ca. 150 species of Asclepias and relatives. Research ac-
tivities can involve ﬁeld work in the US, Mexico, and/or
South America, next-generation DNA sequencing, and
phylogenetic and phylogenomic anlalysis. Opportu-
nities exist for PhD students to develop independent
projects making use of the considerable data generated
for this research.
Students will be supported by a combination of
research and teaching assistantships. Information

1-2 PhD position(s) (3 years) for a conservation biolo-
gist/restoration ecologist
who will work in an applied research programme co-
funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, en-
titled: Grassland management: designing tomorrow’s
farmland for biodiversity
The successful candidate(s) will work either in Swiss
lowland farmland (high intensity, but revitalized culti-
vated matrices) or in Alpine grassland (rapidly inten-
sifying, but biodiversity rich meadowland). The goal
of the project is to deliver evidence-based grassland
management policies that can provide optimal condi-
tions for wildlife in agro-ecosystems while maintaining
acceptable levels of productivity. Natural experiments
on the eﬀects of innovative management practices on
species diversity and abundance will be carried out in
the ﬁeld. For instance, it will be tested to which ex-
tent spatio-temporal habitat heterogeneity may be re-
stored in farmland by applying new management op-
tions ( ~adapted agri-environment schemes in the low-
lands) compatible with modern modes of agricultural
production, and what is the ideal level of management
intensity for both yield and biodiversity-friendly grass
production (subalpine meadowland).
Candidates must have a MSc/Diplom degree and a
strong interest for agro-ecological issues. They must
master modern analytical techniques and software.
Knowledge of grassland indicator taxa would be ad-vantageous. Good knowledge of spoken and written En-
glish is prerequisite, while knowledge of German and/or
French would be a plus for communicating with local
farmers. Start: January-February 2010. Salary accord-
ing to SNSF conditions. The successful candidates are
also expected to take part to teaching and minor ad-
ministrative duties.
Send a letter of motivation, your CV including a list
of publications, as well as the names, institutional ad-
dresses, emails and phone numbers of two references to
susanne.maurer@iee.unibe.ch.
Application deadline is December 5th 2009. Interviews
of selected candidates will take place in Bern during
week 51 (14-18 December 2009).

*Phenotypic plasticity of behaviour and metabolic rate
in the lesser wax moth*
Application deadline: 18. November 2009
A PhD position (E13 TVL 65%) is available within the
Evolutionary Biology research group of Prof. Klaus
Reinhold at University Bielefeld. The project *“Eﬀects
of larval density and larval food on adult behaviour and
physiology in the lesser wax moth /Achroia grisella/:
adaptive anticipation of future environments”* belongs
to a group of seven related projects within the DFG
funded research group ’/Reduction of phenotypic plas-
ticity in behaviour by early experience: functional con-
sequences of an adaptive mechanism?/’ The main aim
of our project is to examine the adaptive phenotypic
plasticity of behaviour as well as the metabolic rate
in dependence of experimental manipulation of larval
food and larval competition. Within the here described
project we will concentrate on the plasticity of acous-
tic and chemical communication. We will use the lesser
wax moth, Achroia grisella, as a model system, as these
insects have short generation time, can easily be bred

UBritishColumbia spiderPhylogeny
ecomorphology
Wayne Maddison at the University of British Columbia
(Canada) is seeking a doctoral student to study the
ecological diversiﬁcation of salticid spiders at an inter-
continental scale. Major themes are or could be phy-
logeny, ecomorphology, biogeography, community as-
sembly, adaptive radiation.
There are about 5000 described, and many more unde-
scribed, species of salticid spiders. Recent phylogenetic
work has shown that major salticid clades are largely
endemic to a single continental region. Each of these
separate radiations contains hundreds of species span-
ning a broad array of body forms and habitat prefer-
ence. To be studied are whether these radiations show
convergence in morphologies as they relate to ecology.
The system then would be a large-scale analogue to
well known replicate radiations such as the Caribbean
Anolis lizards and Hawaiian Tetragnatha spiders.
The research will involve tropical ﬁeld work, molecular
phylogenetics, and morphometrics.
Prospective students are also invited to consider other
projects in the Maddison lab, which are: (1) system-
atics and taxonomy of salticid spiders; (2) phylogeny,
hybridization, and evolution of courtship behaviour and
chromosomes in Habronattus jumping spiders; (3) ana-
lytical methods for inferring evolutionary process from
phylogeny.
For more information about the Maddison lab, go

son lab is in UBC’s Biodiversity Research Centre, a
diverse group of leading evolutionary biologists and
ecologists ( http://biodiversity.ubc.ca ). For information

UBritishColumbia spiderPhylogeny
hybridiz sexSel
Wayne Maddison at the University of British Columbia
(Canada) is seeking a graduate student (preferably
PhD, but possibly Masters) to study diversiﬁcation as it
relates to hybridization and sexual selection in a group
of North American jumping spiders (Salticidae).
The genus Habronattus has about 100 described
species, many with courtship ornaments and behaviours
rivalling those of birds ( http://www.youtube.com/-
watch?v=QuWMmAqnpCI ). Published and unpub-
lished molecular phylogenetic analyses hint that hy-
bridization between distinct species groups may have
played a role in their diversiﬁcation. By extending our
molecular phylogenetic data to more genes and speci-
mens we will study the extent of hybridization among
closely and more distantly related species, and whether
hybridization is concentrated in groups with simpler or
more complex courtship. The latter is a possible out-
come if there is antagonistic coevolution between male
and female sexual traits.
Optional extensions of the project could involve a more
direct focus on behavioural evolution or on chromosome
evolution. The group shows repeated evolutions of aneo-XXXY sex chromosome system. This work will
take advantage of existing collaborations with other re-
searchers working on Habronattus.
The research will involve ﬁeld work (in the southern
United States and possibly Mexico), molecular phylo-
genetics and phylogeography, and possibly behavioural
or chromosomal analysis.
Prospective students are also invited to consider other
projects in the Maddison lab, which are: (1) system-
atics and taxonomy of salticid spiders; (2) phylogeny,
biogeography and ecological diversiﬁcation of salticid
spiders at an intercontinental scale; (3) analytical meth-
ods for inferring evolutionary process from phylogeny.

UGeulph AtlanticSalmon
GenomicSelection32 EvolDir December 1, 2009
A Ph.D. position in Atlantic Salmon Ecological Ge-
nomics and Genomic selection is available beginning in
January or May 2010 with funding for three years.
The project is led by Dr. Elizabeth Boulding (In-
tegrative Biology, U. Guelph) with co-investigators
Dr. Larry Schaeﬀer (Animal and Poultry Science,
U. Guelph and 2009 recipient of the Hermann-von-
Nathusius-Medaille) and Dr. Patricia Schulte (Zoology,
U.B.C.). We are collaborating with Drs. Brian Glebe
and Patrick O’Reilly and of the Department of Fish-
eries and Oceans, Canada (DFO), Dr. Keng Pee Ang
and Jake Elliot of Cooke Aquaculture Canada, and Dr.
Sigbj c/circlecopyrtrn Liens group from CIGENE at the Norwegian
University of Life Sciences.
The Ph.D. project with Dr. Boulding involves look-
ing for correlations between thousands of Single Nu-
cleotide Polymorphisms (SNPS) and morphological, be-
havioural, life history, and physiological traits in At-
lantic salmon, and determining the extent to which
these correlations have an underlying genetic basis.
These correlations are the basis of genomic selection
which will be validated using historical DNA samples,
and breeding records along with new statistical soft-
ware that has been developed at the University of
Guelph. We will use Fst outlier analysis to identify
SNPs that show more diﬀerences in allele frequencies
between the wild and aquacultural salmon populations
than expected under neutral theory which may allow
us to identify the genome regions that have responded
to domestication selection when the Saint Johns aqua-
cultural strain was founded. These SNP genetic mark-
ers may eventually enable the aquaculture industry to
practice genomic selection for complex traits within the
St. John’s Aquaculture strain of Atlantic salmon that
is authorized for use in New Brunswick.
Atlantic salmon from the inner Bay of Fundy (iBoF)
are listed by the Committee on the Status of Endan-
gered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Researchers at
DFO have used molecular markers to demonstrate that
some smolts obtained from the Upper Salmon River in
the iBoF are F1 hybrids between European aquacul-
ture and North American ﬁsh. We will genotype fam-
ilies from backcrossed North American and European
aquacultural strains that have been held in a common
hatchery tanks at St. Andrews Biological Station. This
will enable us to document statistical associations be-
tween SNPs in candidate genes and genetic diﬀerences
in complex traits among these endangered salmon pop-
ulations which, may assist in their conservation.
The Ph.D. position with Dr. Boulding requires a back-
ground in evolutionary/computational biology or popu-
lation/quantitative/statistical genetics, and preferablyat least one peer-reviewed paper in population or quan-
titative genetics, or genome biology or molecular ani-
mal breeding. The position would either suit molecular
ecologists interested in ecological genomics or molec-
ular animal breeders, or bioinformatics students with
statistical or computational biology interests. However,
experimentalists must demonstrate an aptitude for an-
alytical methods (e.g., UNIX, Perl, R, QTL Express)
given the massive phenotype/SNP genotype datasets
that must be analyzed whereas bioinformatics students
must demonstrate an aptitude for salmon biology.
Please apply for the Ph.D. position with Dr. Bould-
ing (boulding@uoguelph.ca) by emailing her a short re-
sume, an unoﬃcial electronic transcript of all your uni-
versity grades, and a statement that you are willing
to travel from your home university in Guelph to New
Brunswick or to Norway as needed for the proposed re-
search. To be selected for a Ph.D. position you need to
be eligible for admission to our graduate program. Dr.
Boulding is in the Department of Integrative Biology at
the University of Guelph: http://www.uoguelph.ca/-

sion requirements; note that you may have to write and
receive a passing grade on the TOEFL test if English
is not your ﬁrst language.

Project description: The Brassicaceae are developing
into the most important model group in plant science
aside the grass family. This is not only because of the
model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica na-
pus, but also the enormously increasing knowledge on
all aspects of biology and evolution concerning this fam-ily The family is characterized by frequently occurring
hybridization and poly-ploidization, which, as a conse-
quence, is greatly aﬀecting genome size and structure,
but also any mode of speciation. Nonetheless, it is still
unclear if the evolution of the Brassicaceae on the var-
ious taxonomic/temporal levels and of its evolutionary
lineages is mostly or even best explained by multiple ra-
diation events. A fact that can also account for the diﬃ-
culties to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships within
the family. In the overall project we are aiming to use
the actually available knowledge and phylogenetic data
and a phylogenetic backbone to address these principles
questions of crucifer evolution by adding genome size
and cytogenetic data across the whole family. In the
proposed PhD project the chalcone synthase has been
selected as candidate locus to reconstruct such a robust
framework phylogeny with a nearly constant molecular
clock. This will enable calibration of any evolution-
ary hypothesis. In order to obtain this evolutionary
framework, chs genes have to be characterized in detail
(copy number, ortholoques, paraloques, pseudogenes)
in a representative set of taxa across the whole Bras-
sicaceae family. Subsequent functional and theoretical
analysis will provide additional information on modes
of molecular evolution creating chs diversity in the en-
tire family.

EUTROPHICATION OF THE BALTIC SEA: EF-
FECTS OF PARASITES ON THREESPINE STICK-
LEBACK POPULATIONS
The environment of the Baltic Sea is currently chang-
ing due to eutrophication. Monitoring of threespine
stickleback populations Gasterosteus aculeatus in the
archipelago of Southern Finland has revealed that stick-
lebacks breeding in eutrophied coastal waters are less
parasitized than sticklebacks breeding in clear waters,
particularly when it comes to the dominating parasite
Schistocephalus solidus. This could result from diﬀer-
ences in exposure to parasites or diﬀerences in resis-
tance to parasites. The objectives of the current project
are to: a) determine the correlations between eutrophi-
cation and parasite infections in threespine stickleback
populations in the Baltic Sea, and b) experimentally
investigate the causes of the correlations for diﬀerent
parasites.
I invite highly motivated students with a good back-
ground in Evolutionary Ecology to apply for the posi-
tion. A MSc or equivalent education level is required.
Earlier experience with ﬁsh or parasites is not required.
The student will collaborate with other PhD students
investigating the eﬀects of eutrophication on sticklebackpopulations. Funding is guaranteed for 3 years, by Maj
and Tor Nessling Foundation, in the form of a personal
grant of 1525euro/month. Funding for a 4th year might
be possible. Starting date: The work can start imme-
diately but the starting date is negotiable.
If interested, please submit your CV, contact details for
three references, and a summary of research experience
and interests to ulrika.candolin@helsinki.ﬁ

UIdaho TreeOfLife
“Measuring the tree of life”: PhD student position in
comparative methods for macroevolutionI have a position opening in Fall 2010 for a
PhD student to work in the Harmon lab ( http://-
www.webpages.uidaho.edu/˜lukeh/ ). The student will
work as a part of an NSF-funded team on a project
called “Measuring the Tree of Life.” The project has
two goals: to improve the process by which rates of
evolution are estimated from comparative data, and to
characterize the tempo of diversiﬁcation and morpho-
logical evolution of vertebrates. The student will be
involved with developing and testing new comparative
methods for macroevolution. The position is a Research
Assistantship in the Department of Biological Sciences
at the University of Idaho. Funding is guaranteed and
the student will have no teaching responsibilities for at
least the ﬁrst two years.
The successful applicant will have strong quantitative
skills. The work involves statistical analysis and com-
puter programming, so math and computer skills are
essential. My lab is aﬃliated with the Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology program and the Initiative
for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies at the Uni-
versity of Idaho, so applications from students with a
strong desire to learn computational skills will also be
considered. I also want a student who is not afraid to
think big and to work at broad and diverse scales.
We have a very interactive department with a
number of great evolutionary biologists ( http://-

UJyvaskyla PathogenResistance
PhD-student position at the Centre of Excellence in
Evolutionary Research (University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Fin-
land and EAWAG/ETH-Z¨ urich, Switzerland)
ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF PATHOGEN RE-
SISTANCE IN THERMALLY VARIABLE ENVIRON-
MENTS
One important factor modifying host-pathogen interac-
tions is the variation in environmental conditions (e.g.
ambient temperature). Ongoing climate change is ex-
pected to increase the frequency of extreme weather
conditions such as heat waves, and this has been sug-
gested to have a large impact on ecological interactions.
In this project, the eﬀect of high ambient temperature
on pathogen resistance of a freshwater snail Lymnaea
stagnalis will be examined. The goals of the project are
to determine 1) how high temperature aﬀects snail im-
mune functions, 2) how these alterations are connected
to other life history traits (e.g. longevity, reproduc-
tion), and 3) if natural snail populations across Europe
show additive genetic variation in tolerance for high
temperature and if they are able to adapt to changing
environmental conditions.
We invite highly motivated students with a good back-
ground in evolutionary ecology to apply for the posi-
tion. A MSc or equivalent degree is required. Earlier
experience with snails or immunological work is not re-
quired. The student will work in a research group led
by Prof. Jukka Jokela (EAWAG/ETH-Z¨ urich, Switzer-
land). The group is part of the Centre of Excellence in
Evolutionary Research based in University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a
in Finland and the student will register as a graduate
student in the University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a. Some of the
ﬁeld work will be done in Finland and the rest of the
work (most experiments, writing) will be carried out at
EAWAG in Switzerland. Funding is for 3 years.
Starting date: early 2010
If interested, please submit your CV, contact infor-
mation for two references, and a brief summary of
research experience and interests to Otto Sepp¨ al¨ a

PhD studentship in multivariate evolution
I seek candidates for a full-time three-year PhD stu-
dentship in Evolutionary Biology at the University of
Stirling, for which funding has already been secured.The research topic is somewhat ﬂexible but will be re-
lated to the broad themes of my research group ( http:/-
/www.sbes.stir.ac.uk/people/bussiere/ ), most of which
are related to the evolution of complex phenotypes.
Much of my current research exploits insect model sys-
tems such as ﬁeld crickets, dung ﬂies, and dance ﬂies to
study controversial issues in natural and sexual selec-
tion. We measure multivariate selection and evolution
in the wild and study evolutionary and phenotypic re-
sponses to stresses in replicated laboratory populations.
The detailed research plan will be devised in consulta-
tion with me before the position begins.
My students and I apply a mix of theoretical ap-
proaches, behavioural studies, quantitative genetics
and molecular techniques to track inheritance and re-
productive success in natural and laboratory popula-
tions. We have a large network of collaborators from
leading research groups around the world. Depending
on the topic of study chosen, there are likely to be sev-
eral opportunities for training or conducting ﬁeldwork
with one or more of these collaborators overseas.
Stirling is conveniently situated within easy commut-
ing distance from Glasgow and Edinburgh but is also
moments from the stunning natural environments of
the Scottish Highlands. With arguably the most scenic
campus in the United Kingdom, the School of Biological
and Environmental Sciences at the University of Stir-
ling features a young and research active group of sci-
entists. The collegial and intellectual atmosphere com-
bined with nearby and easy access to fantastic natural
areas makes for an ideal working environment. Further-
more, the opportunities for scientiﬁc interactions with
other Scottish Universities are numerous.
The successful candidate will be self-motivated, intel-
lectually curious, creative, and dedicated to working
long hours during periodically labour-intensive exper-
iments. He or she will be expected to contribute ac-
tively to the intellectual climate of the School of Bi-
ological and Environmental Sciences, where the pro-
gram includes active participation in School seminars
and training in presentation skills, experimental design
and advanced statistical techniques. The starting date
is negotiable, but ideally the project should begin as
soon as possible.
Candidates should provide a statement of re-
search interests and a CV including contact in-
formation for at least 2 referees to Luc Bussi` ere
(luc.bussiere@stir.ac.uk). Additional evidence of the
candidate’s scholarly activities (e.g., published papers

UNotreDame Speciation Disease
The Hollocher laboratory is seeking highly motivated
PhD students interested in interdisciplinary approaches
that link population genetics to other core disciplines
to address fundamental questions in speciation and dis-
ease ecology.
A major focus of my laboratory is on linking pop-
ulation genetics with developmental biology and ge-
nomic analyses in order to understand how changes
in gene regulation and development lead to reproduc-
tive incompatibilities (i.e. hybrid sterility and inviabil-
ity) and morphological diﬀerentiation (speciﬁcally, pig-
mentation patterning) among closely related species of
Drosophila in Africa and the Caribbean. Along these
lines we investigate how genetic polymorphisms within
species contribute to ﬁxed diﬀerences between species
for developmental traits important in speciation.
More recently we have started a new avenue of re-
search that links population genetics to GIS analy-
sis, computer modeling, and parasitology to investigate
how physical, social, cultural, and genetic landscapes
interact to inﬂuence pathogen transmission dynam-
ics in populations of long-tailed macaques in human-
altered landscapes in Southeast Asia. Here, we use ge-
netic structuring of macaque hosts and their pathogens
to make predictions about how speciﬁc aspects of
these diﬀerent landscape features facilitate or inhibit
pathogen transmission among populations.
For more information, visit the Hollocher labo-
ratory homepage ( http://www.nd.edu/%7Ehholloch/-
index.html ).
The ideal PhD candidate would have a strong back-
ground in evolutionary and population genetics and
experience with molecular laboratory work. Experi-
ence in the ﬁeld would be a plus, but not absolutely
essential. Students in my laboratory are encouraged
to develop their own research projects within the gen-
eral framework of the questions being addressed by the
laboratory. Interested students should send an e-maildescribing your research interests and prior experience
to: hope.hollocher.1@nd.edu.
The Hollocher laboratory is part of a larger group of
active researchers housed in the Department of Bio-
logical Sciences ( http://www.biology.nd.edu/ ), Univer-
sity of Notre Dame ( http://www.nd.edu/ ), which of-
fers a wide-range of research opportunities and grad-
uate coursework in all aspects of evolutionary biology,
allowing students to excel in ﬁeld, laboratory, and ge-
netic analyses. Strengths of the program include: pop-
ulation and evolutionary genetics, genomics, speciation,
adaptation, global climate change, and disease ecol-
ogy. Our close-knit faculty provides interdisciplinary
research opportunities and excellent research mentor-
ship. The department boasts state-of-the-art core re-
search facilities and has researchers working in ﬁeld
sites throughout the US, British Columbia, Africa, the
Caribbean, China, and Southeast Asia.
Graduate Research and Teaching Assistantships and
several competitive fellowships are available for stu-
dents wishing to pursue Ph.D. degrees, including fellow-
ships in our department’s IGERT-GLOBES graduate
training program that supports students interested in
interdisciplinary approaches to solving human and en-
vironmental health issues ( http://globes.nd.edu/ ). No
matter the ultimate source of support, all students re-
ceive a generous stipend with full tuition provided by
the Graduate School.

UOulu GooseEvolution
PhD student position at the Department of Biology,
University of Oulu, Finland40 EvolDir December 1, 2009
Domestication history of the European goose
Domestic goose Anser anser domesticus has been one
of the earliest and most important examples of bird do-
mestication. In Europe alone there are approximately
50 recognised breeds. However, virtually nothing is
known about timing, location and manner of goose
domestication, and how it compares to domestication
of other species. This will be the ﬁrst detailed study
of these phenomena. We will use molecular markers
(mtDNA, microsatellites, genome sequencies) and ge-
ometric morphometrics to study modern wild and do-
mestic as well as archaeological specimens. The project
brings together multidisciplinary expertise in popula-
tion and conservation genetics (Minna Ruokonen, Uni-
versity of Oulu), phylogeography (Jeremy Searle, Uni-
versity of York/Cornell University), livestock domesti-
cation and archaeology (Keith Dobney, University of
Aberdeen). A bioinformatician will join the project in
2011.
The student will be based at the Department of Biology,
University of Oulu, where he/she will join the Popula-
tion Genetics Group (to be formed in 2010) with ca.
30 academic researchers and technical staﬀ. The group
belongs to the Population Genetics Graduate School.
The studentship will involve substantial periods of re-
search at both Cornell University and the University of
Aberdeen.
The position is for four years (2010-2013) and the start-
ing date is early 2010. Starting salary is ca. 2000 eur
per month, and can be raised after assessment of per-
sonal performance (as evaluated by ECTS and publi-
cations) and changes in the job demand level. The po-
sition includes some teaching responsibilities (5% from
the annual working time).
We invite motivated applicants with background and
M.Sc. in a relevant ﬁeld (population or conservation ge-
netics, molecular archaeology). The applicants should
submit their CV, contact information of two referees
and a short statement of their research interests (in-
cluding a summary of MSc or undergraduate work) as
a single .pdf ﬁle to minna.ruokonen@oulu.ﬁ. Review of
the applicants will begin December 15th, but applicants
will be considered until the position is ﬁlled.

Project: Personality and reproductive success in house
sparrows In behavioural and evolutionary biology, there
has been a recent explosive interest in the phenomenon
known as behavioural syndromes (i.e., animal person-
ality or consistent behavioural diﬀerences between in-
dividuals across diverse contexts). A realization of
the ubiquity of behavioural syndromes in the wild has
shaken the traditional view of animal behaviour whereDecember 1, 2009 EvolDir 41
behavioural phenotypes should be inﬁnitely ﬂexible to
be adaptive at any given context. Despite much in-
terest in animal personality research, still very little is
known about how diﬀerent personality can aﬀect the
ﬁtness of animals. We will use a long-term monitored
population of house sparrows on Lundy Island to in-
vestigate the link between ﬁtness and personality in
the wild. There are ﬁve personality traits recognized:
activity, boldness, exploration, aggressiveness and so-
ciability. We will particularly focus on the ﬁrst three
personality traits. Our previous studies have demon-
strated that two behavioural traits, parental care and
ﬁdelity (quantiﬁed by extra-pair mating) are repeatable
within individuals, meaning, for example, that some
individuals express consistently high parental care or
that others are successful at gaining extra-pair pater-
nity through their lifetime. Obviously these two traits
have signiﬁcant ﬁtness consequences. The project will
be among the ﬁrst to investigate intricate interactions
among these ﬁtness-related behavioural traits (parental
care and mate ﬁdelity) and personality traits (e.g., ac-
tivity, boldness and exploration). The project ﬁts in a
larger research program focusing on understanding the
short-term and long-term consequences of the interac-
tions between genes and behaviour.
Requirements: We are seeking a motivated and inde-
pendent team player to join our House-sparrow research
group. Ideally, you have previous research experience,
and are interested in birds and behavioural ecology.
Knowledge of handling birds and/or a ringing license
are an advantage, but not a requirement. You will
be expected to spend the breeding season on Lundy
Island for data collection and should be able to start
early 2010. The graduate position is for 3 years. The

strictions. Please send your application (CV, let-

CyanobacterialGenomics
Dear Evoldir,We are seeking applicants for a PhD position at the
University of St Andrews, Scotland.
EVOLUTION AND FUNCTION OF CYANOBACTE-
RIAL GENES AND GENOMES
Supervisors: Dr Daniel Barker, University of St An-
drews, and Professor Geoﬀrey Codd, University of
Dundee.
This project will improve knowledge of the evolution,
metabolism, ecotoxicological status and biotechnologi-
cal potential of cyanobacteria by the development and
application of bioinformatics algorithms. Cyanobac-
teria are a metabolically diverse group of photosyn-
thetic prokaryotes of global distribution. They play
a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles (oxygen, car-
bon, nitrogen), produce toxins which present major
health hazards to humans and animals, yet also contain
metabolites with therapeutic and biotechnological ap-
plications, including biofuels. At least 48 cyanobacte-
rial genomes have been sequenced. However, the func-
tion of many of the genes in their genomes remains un-
known. This represents a major gap in biological knowl-
edge which would be diﬃcult to ﬁll by traditional ap-
proaches. We have developed a comparative, bioinfor-
matics procedure to delimit groups of genes which are
functionally linked, on the basis of correlated gain and
loss of those genes from genomes. This must be vastly
improved, to also model gene-phenotype and gene-
environment interactions, and applied to cyanobacteria.
The project would involve research in computational
comparative genomics. Results will be of interest to re-
searchers in bioinformatics, environmental and health
sciences and in biotechnology.

UWyoming MicrobialEvolution
Ph.D. Assistantship in Microbial Cell Biology and Evo-
lution
A graduate assistantship (Ph.D.) is available at
the University of Wyoming in Laramie ( http://-
www.uwyo.edu ) for a student interested in the evolu-
tionary history and biological consequences of cellular
compartmentalization in bacteria. It is now known that
bacteria, long considered to be simple life forms, in-
clude species with complex cell plans. While some com-
partments have well-characterized roles in sequestering
physiological processes, the function of others is unde-
termined. The signiﬁcance of membrane-bound com-
partments (superﬁcially resembling eukaryotic nuclei)
that separate genomic DNA from other bacterial cell
contents is particularly elusive.
Applicants should have a strong record of academic
excellence, prior laboratory experience, and a demon-
strated interest in microbial evolution and cell bi-
ology. The project is bench-based; students inter-
ested in pursuing purely computational approaches
should not apply. Motivated students with prior
experience in immunoﬂuorescence or immunoelectron
microscopy and/or in vivo detection of protein ex-
pression will be given especially strong considera-
tion. The successful candidate will be enrolled through
the University of Wyoming’s Molecular and Cellular
Life Sciences Ph.D. program ( http://www.uwyo.edu/-
MCLS/ ), or the Department of Molecular Biol-
ogy’s Ph.D. program ( http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/-
uwmolecbio/PhD.asp ). The position will ideally begin
in late spring/early summer of 2010.
To apply: Please email the following application ma-
terials (as one PDF ﬁle) to Naomi Ward at nl-
ward@uwyo.edu: 1) a current resume or CV, including
GPA and test scores (if available); 2) a cover letter, in-
cluding research interests, professional goals and prior
experience; and 3) contact information, including emailaddresses, of three potential references. Review of ap-
plications will begin February 1, 2010.

UZurich Inbreeding
4-Year PhD position on the evolutionary genetics of iso-
lated populations with Dr. Erik Postma and Prof. Dr.
Lukas Keller at the University of Zurich, Switzerland.
Integrating pedigree and marker data to study inbreed-
ing depression and purging in the wild
Even after over a century of research, the interplay be-
tween inbreeding, genetic variation and ﬁtness remains
a fascinating and active area of research, with many
questions remaining unanswered. Recent molecular and
statistical advances have opened up new avenues for re-
search, providing exciting opportunities to gain a more
mechanistic understanding of inbreeding depression in
the wild.
We have recently embarked on a large-scale project on
the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in the song
sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population on Mandarte
Island, Canada. This population has some of the most
complete and extensive pedigrees of any natural popu-
lation, and analyses of inbreeding and its consequences
have revealed signiﬁcant inbreeding depression in sev-
eral ﬁtness components.
Currently we are in the process of genotyping the com-
plete population for a large number of genetic mark-
ers. Combining this genetic information with exten-
sive pedigree and life-history data will provide a unique
opportunity to gain a better understanding of how in-
breeding aﬀects genetic variation, and how genetic vari-
ation aﬀects ﬁtness.
For this PhD project we are seeking somebody who is
independent, creative and highly motivated, with an
interest in (quantitative and population) genetics and
(evolutionary and behavioural) ecology. Our ideal can-
didate has no fear of equations, statistics and large
amounts of data, but is not afraid to get his or her
hands dirty in the lab or the ﬁeld either. Experience
with programming in R or SAS is not essential. The
willingness to learn either of the two is, however, cru-
cial.44 EvolDir December 1, 2009
While the song sparrow population dataset will provide
the centrepiece of the project, excursions into other sys-
tems (ranging from ibex to fruit ﬂies) are possible, and
in fact highly encouraged. We oﬀer a stimulating and
social working environment, excellent facilities (includ-
ing a well-equipped molecular lab). The student will
participate in the PhD program in evolutionary biol-
ogy of the University of Zurich. The starting date of
the project is negotiable.
Zurich consistently ranks amongst the cities with the
highest quality of life. While it oﬀers all the pleasures of
living in a bigger city, thanks to its central location and
excellent public transport connections, it is extremely
easy to get out of the city and head for the mountains,
in both summer and winter.
Applicants should have an MSc (or equivalent) in a rel-
evant ﬁeld.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter, includ-
ing a brief description of what you have to oﬀer to the
project and our group, and what you hope to get back
in return 2) a detailed curriculum vitae 3) the contact
details of two references 4) a 1 page summary of your
MSc or undergraduate work
Send the above as a single .pdf ﬁle to
e.postma@access.uzh.ch
Review of applications will start on 15 December 2009,
but candidates will be considered until the position is
ﬁlled.

up to three years. Salary will be £28,829 - £35,469
per annum depending upon experience. You will join
the research active Computational Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Group at the University of Manchester.
Project Title: Genomic and Geographical Barriers to
Gene Flow in a Major Malaria Vector in Myanmar and
northeast India
Project Background: The mosquito species, Anopheles
baimaii, is a major malaria vector found in the forests
of Myanmar and northeast India. Information on rates
of contemporary gene ﬂow and geographic and genomic
barriers to gene ﬂow in An. baimaii is essential for both
conventional and novel malaria control strategies. As
An. baimaii can also serve as an indicator species for
forest biodiversity, this study can also inform of us of
the processes generating forest biodiversity in this re-
gion and how such biodiversity may be conserved in the
long term. This study will identify landscape features
that form geographical barriers to gene ﬂow by com-
bining microsatellite and landscape data in landscape
genetics analyses. Using microsatellite and sequence
data inside and outside of chromosomal inversions we
will also determine the role of chromosomal inversions
as genomic barriers to gene ﬂow. The UK researcher
will work as part of a team including researchers from
medical research institutes in Myanmar and northeast
India.Responsibilites: You will take responsibility for the gen-

in the 21st century, the Chair may focus on classical in-
heritance, functional genomics, gene expression, bioin-
formatics, evolutionary genetics, or other areas that in-
tegrate genes and/or genomic material into the research
program. The Chair will be actively involved in service
to the College and University, as well as to the scientiﬁc
profession. The term of the Endowed Chair is ﬁve years
and is renewable.
The Chair will: * Develop and maintain a produc-
tive, externally funded research program that involves
the study of genetics, genomics, and/or genes. * De-
velop courses (for graduate, undergraduate, and/ornon-science students) and programs that focus on the
genetics, genomics and/or genes, as well as seminar
courses that address social, legal, and ethical consid-
erations at the interface of genetics and society. * Par-
ticipate in the development of long-term plans of the
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and of the Univer-
sity as they relate to ongoing eﬀorts to ensure excellence
in undergraduate education in the sciences within the
context of a liberal arts education. * Work with fac-
ulty colleagues within the University to seek external
funding for new and creative initiatives in both edu-
cation and scientiﬁc research that foster the personal
and professional development of Villanova undergradu-
ate science students. * Enhance the national reputation
of the University and College through contributions to

AFLP background noise
Dear all,
Maybe these are very elementary questions for this list,
but I am beginning with AFLP analysis and I have
some doubts (probably elementary ones as I said)
- Which are the main causes of background noise and
how to correct it? - May the dye colour inﬂuence the
magnitude of the background noise? - How can protein
/ phenol contamination of the extracted DNA aﬀect
AFLP quality? - Is there any problem to overlay mul-
tiple primers with diﬀerent dye labels? May peaks in
one dye interfere with detection of other dyes?
Any references you could advice me to get into this
subject and clarify my doubts?
Thanks.

Allele dropout microsats
Hello, all–I have a microsatellite ampliﬁcation question I’m hop-
ing you can help me with. My apologies if this has
come up on the list before; I scanned the archive with-
out success, but may have missed something.
The question: is there anything published on the fre-
quency of allele dropout when using touchdown pro-
grams to amplify microsatellites?
Years ago, I tested some microsats (for crabs, I be-
lieve) with a touchdown program and with a range of
single-annealing temp programs. When I ran the PCRs
out on a BaseStation, it was obvious that in a signif-
icant number of instances the touchdown program re-
sulted in homozygotes, while the single-temp programs
showed heterozygotes. It appeared that in heterozy-
gotes, sometimes the smaller-length alleles were being
preferentially ampliﬁed with the touchdown program,
and the larger alleles were dropping out. Taking this
as a cautionary tale, I’ve always been careful to run
microsats with optimized single-temp programs. Other
than that, I never really followed up on it. I note now
that it is not uncommon to see papers that use touch-
down PCR to amplify microsats, and am curious if a)
there is anything published on the matter, and b) any-
one else has had noticed dropout (or not!) in program
comparisons.
A quick search didn’t turn up anything in the lit, so
I was hoping a few of you could point me in the right
direction. Of course, I’ll post a follow-up e-mail listing
people’s responses.
Thank you!

AlleleFreq Fst answers
Here’s a summary of replies I received from my query
about how to calculate pairwise FSTs when you only
have allelic frequency data not raw genotypes. For my
purposes using the POPTREE2 program (#7) was the
simplest solution.
1. from memory, Swoﬀord and Selander’s BIOSYS does
this.
2. if you have sample size (the number of individu-
als from which your allele frequencies were obtained),
I guess you can calculate pairwise FST by using di-
rectly the Weir&Cockerham(1984) method. In their
equations, you need to know allele frequencies, sample
size, number of populations plus a few other variables
such the heterozygosities and mean allele frequencies
that you should be able to compute from allele frequen-
cies. I remember I had implemented a Matlab script to
do it and it worked pretty well.
3. Attached please ﬁnd a script that calculates pairwise
Fst using simuPOP (simupop.sourceforge.net). My
previous script used real genotype but I have modiﬁed
it to assign random genotype using speciﬁed frequencies
so you should be able to make it work for your data.
You can check the simupop user’s guide if you are inter-
ested in understanding how this script works. NOTE
that the results will be slightly diﬀerent each time you
run this script because of the random initialization of
genotype, and I do not know if this is the correct way
to calculate Fst from frequency data. (Script is from
Bo Peng bpeng@mdanderson.org)
4. Yes, you can use just the allele frequencies. In fact,
all you need are allele frequencies because genotype fre-
quencies are not used for Fst (only for Fis). But you
are going to have to write an analysis program your-
self. I have some simple spreadsheet simulators associ-
ated with my textbook that do it for Rst and Fst (see
chapter 4). You could write a program in Matlab really
easily. Alternatively, you could code up a mock data
set with the correct allele frequencies but composed en-
tirely of homozygotes.
5. There is a bit of software written by Richard Nichols
called Nichols Fst. Unfortunately, you have to run
each population pair separately. You can download it
from his website. It’s in the FstLikelihoods directory:http://webspace.qmul.ac.uk/ranichols/programs/ You
might also consider using a measure of information the-
ory to estimate pairwise diﬀerence, e.g. Shannon’s in-
dex (see Sherwin et al 2006 Mol Ecol) and D (Jost 2008
Mol Ecol). Emerging studies seem to indicate that FST
is not a reliable measure of diﬀerentiation.
6. I have used Arlequin for data from genotype frequen-
cies and haplotype frequencies only but, it seems to me,
that you could name the alleles consecutively from al-
lele 1 of the ﬁrst locus to the last allele (allele X) of
the 6th locus and the pairwise comparison analyses be-
tween populations would work. I would be curious to
know what works.
7. We have developed a computer program called
POPTREE2 that can calculate the pairwise FST
between populations from allele frequency data.
It can be used through a Windows-interface eas-
ily. POPTREE2 is available at the following web-
page. http://www.med.kagawa-u.ac.jp/ ˜ genomelb/-
takezaki/poptree2/index.html 8. Why don’t you calcu-
late it by hand/using a spreadsheet or statistical pack-
age?
9. You’ve probably received an answer to your ques-
tion already but my suggestion would be to fudge the
appropriate input ﬁle using your allele frequency data.
Fst’s for msats are based on frequency and not genetic
distance so you can assign an arbitrary fragment size to
each allele. Obviously this would only work if you know
which alleles are shared between the diﬀerent popula-
tions. As an aside, another issue to consider is the im-
pact of diversity on ﬁxation indices. See Hedrick 2005,
Meirmans 2006, and Jost 2009 for a description of the
statistical issues and remedies associated with using ﬁx-
ation indices to estimate population diﬀerentiation.
Thanks for all the suggestions, Hilary

BarcodeOfLife Web2
The Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL;
www.barcoding.si.edu ), in collaboration with
the International Barcode of Life project (iBOL;
www.ibolproject.org ), is developing a range of new
activities and capabilities that take advantage of Web
2.0 technology. Many of these will be unveiled at the
Third International Barcode of Life Conference in
Mexico City from 7-13 November 2009.
The Barcode of Life is on Twitter!
Tweeters, please follow us @barcodeoﬂife where we’ll
be sharing insights from the community and up-to-the-72 EvolDir December 1, 2009
minute announcements and happenings at the Mex-
ico City conference. And if you plan on tweet-
ing at the conference, please use the oﬃcial con-
ference hashtag: #barcode09. For those of you
who don’t tweet but would like to stay on top of
what’s happening at the conference, bookmark http:/-
/feeds.barcodeoﬂife.net, where you can see barcoding
twitter feeds and media coverage.
The future “Barcode of Life” central website
The rapid growth of DNA barcoding over the past ﬁve
years has led to a proliferation of initiatives, acronyms
and websites. This exuberant growth is a positive sign
of the health of the barcoding enterprise but it can also
be confusing. CBOL and iBOL are developing a new
central website under the banner of “Barcode of Life”
that will provide the community with clear information
about and links to the organizations, initiatives, and
projects that make up the Barcode of Life initiative.
The preliminary design for this website will be unveiled
at the Mexico City conference on computer monitors
distributed outside the auditorium. Conference partic-
ipants will be invited to submit their feedback on the
design.
The Online Barcode of Life Community Network
Both iBOL and CBOL have been working to expand
participation around the world in the Barcode of Life.
The iBOL project leadership has asked CBOL to lead
its Communication and Outreach Working Group, and
CBOL has engaged Night Kitchen Interactive (NKI),
a website and new media company, for this eﬀort.
Matthew Fisher, President of NKI, will be oﬀering
workshops during the Mexico City barcode conference
on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 9-11 November.
Conference participants are invited to attend the work-
shop for a brief introduction to the Barcode of Life
Community Network.
These workshops will take place at:
* 11:00 to 12:00, Monday, 9 November: IB-UNAM
Building B, Classroom 1(?) * 4:00 to 5:00, Monday,
9 November: IB-UNAM Building B, Classroom 1(?) *

Darwin Tunes
At Imperial College we are conducting an experiment
to test the proposition that culture evolves in a Dar-
winian fashion. We have developed a web-based sys-
tem called DarwinTunes in which a population of short
computer-generated-tunes evolves by mutation, recom-
bination and selection.
The selective force is the public. They listen to the
songs, rate them, and so deﬁne their ﬁtness. You can
participate too! We started with a population of ran-
domly generated loops and are currently at ~2000 gen-
erations.

Genotyper software was never tested on the Windows
XP operating system, and that the error states that
there is insuﬃcient memory, but the ﬁx is actually to
reduce the amount of virtual memory on the computer:

Partial Mantel test in Arlequin
Hello,
I’m using partial Mantel tests to test for signiﬁcance of
the relationship between genetic distance, geographical
distance, and habitat continuity among several arthro-
pod populations. It’s all relatively straightforward, ex-
cept in several instances the % determination of Y by
one of the X variables is a negative number. Any in-
sights into why this might be would be greatly appre-
ciated.
Sincerely, Stephanie
stephanie.kamel@gmail.comPaternity number of mates
Other: Multiple paternity and eﬀective number of
mates
Dear Evoldir members,
I apologize in advance for the long posting!
I am interested looking at how multiple paternity af-
fects the maintainence of genetic diversity using empir-
ical data. I have clutches from turtle nesting beaches
in which I have genotyped oﬀpsring. Using standard
procedures for determining number of fathers, I have
found which clutches had single and multiple sires. I
wanted to compare the “actual” number of breeders
(Nb)with the “eﬀective” number of breeders (Neb). I
deﬁne the actual number of breeders in a clutch or in
multiple clutches, as the total number of fathers de-
termined using parentage programs (ex GERUD) and
I deﬁne eﬀective number of breeders as “the number
of breeding individuals inan idealized population that
would show the same amount of dispersion of allele fre-
quenciesunder random genetic driftor the same amount
of inbreedingas the population under consideration (i.e.
eﬀective population size, but in my case refers only to
the clutches sampled).” For one nesting beach sample
(Clutches 0, mothers = 30, fathers = 35) the actual
number of breeders was 65, but the eﬀective number of
breeders (estimated from the program LDNE) is 41.9
(95% conﬁdence interval 33.5-52.1).When determined
on a per clutch basis, the actual number of breeders
per clutch is 2.17 and eﬀective number per clutch is
1.4.
To address how multiple paternity aﬀects the eﬀective
number of breeders, I compared the same values for
clutches only with single paternity and those only with
multiple paternity.
Single Paternity (Clutches = 26, mothers, fathers =2)
the actual number of breeders was 52 (2 per clutch),
but the eﬀective number of breeders was 28.9 (1.1 per
clutch)
Multiple Paternity (Clutches = 4, mothers = 4, fathers
= 7) the actual number of breeders was 13 (3.25 per
clutch), but the eﬀective number of breeders was 10
(2.5 per clutch).
So from the data, ﬁrst oﬀ it seems that eﬀective number
of breeders is less than 2 per clutch(when looking at all78 EvolDir December 1, 2009
clutches or single paternity clutches). I would have ex-
pected at least 2 eﬀective breeders per clutch, regard-
less of multiple paternity. Can anyonesuggest how I
might account for this? I know that females on nesting
beaches are philopatric, so might it be due to coances-
try of nesting females? Or could it also be due to be
due to high levels of relatedness between mother and
father pairs or relatedness between fathers?
Secondly, it seems that single paternity clutches have an
Neb that is 55%of Nb, and multiple paternity clutches
have an Neb that is 77% of Nb. While I expected Neb
would be less than Nb, I can’t think of any reason other
than relatedness between parents why Ne would be less.
I don’t think it is a general trend that multiple pater-
nity clutches maintain an Neb closer to Nb, because
at another nestingbeach Neb is 48% of Nb for multi-
ple paternity clutches and Neb is 66% of Nb for single
paternity clutches.
Any help or direction towards articles would be appre-
ciated!

PopulationGenetics in Python
Dear colleagues,
In case you are interesting in doing programming
in Population Genetics using Python, the Biopython
project includes a module to support basic methods.
We currently support calculation of several statistics
and methods (exact tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium, population diﬀerentiation, genotypic disequilib-
rium, F-statistics, null allele frequencies, allele size-
based statistics for microsatellites and much more), Co-
alescent simulation and selection detection via a Fst-
based outlier method.
The design philosophy of the module is to leverage ex-
isting, widely-used and known population genetics ap-
plications. So, as an example, to calculate Fst we use
Genepop. We provide a set of wrapper libraries to
known applications.
We tried in as much as possible to construct easy to use
interfaces, as an example, to calculate some F-statistics
of a certain locus from a genepop ﬁle the code is as sim-
ple as:from Bio.PopGen.GenePop.EasyController
import EasyController ctrl = EasyCon-
troller(your ﬁlehere) Fis, Fst, Fit, Qintra, Qinter
= ctrl.get fstats(locus name here)
The most recent version of Biopython (1.52) is required
for most of the functionality described above.
In case you have any issues (doubts, bugs, suggestions,
etc), please don’t hesitate to contact the biopython user
mailing list at: biopython@biopython.org .
The starting point for the PopGen functionality
is:http://www.biopython.org/wiki/PopGen where you
will ﬁnd documentation in wiki and tutorial form

RossCrozier reminiscence
Ross Crozier (1943-2009) —–
I did not know Ross well but we exchanged various
friendly e-mails on molecular evolution over the years.
We met at the Hennig Society meeting IX, Canberra,
1990. I was a PhD student, giving my ﬁrst serious
conference presentation. I told them that phylogenetic
inference needed models of evolution, statistical consis-
tency is important, and parsimony can be seen as likeli-
hood under a simple model where the parameter values
matter. It was very scary; Steve Farris, amongst others
was in the audience. Luckily for me, my talk was rightDecember 1, 2009 EvolDir 79
before a coﬀee break and so most cladists were more in-
terested in that than in attacking what they no doubt
saw as a misguided PhD student. Ross made the eﬀort
to come up to me after my talk and introduce himself,
and tell me he enjoyed my talk. It was *exactly* what
I needed to hear - it doesn’t matter if it was true or not
- and I will remember him forever for that.
I still have my List of Participants from that
meeting, annotated with various ticks for people I
met/liked/really liked, and a very few asterisks for peo-
ple who were “nice to me about my talk”. Ross got
multiple ticks and a large asterisk.

“Dear Evoldir members,
We have noticed some recent posting asking for an open
source microsatellite genotyping software. We have re-
cently developed a PERL pipeline for dealing with mi-
crosatellite data called P2EMA, and would like to make
it open for anyone to try it and tell us how could it be
improved.
P2EMA is a Perl/Tk graphical user interface (GUI)
that facilitates several tasks when scoring microsatel-
lites. It does so by implementing new subroutines in R
and PERL and taking advantage of features provided
by previously developed software such as PeakScan-
ner, CREATE and AlleloBin. P2EMA allows running
PeakScanner easily from the commandline, analysing
markers from several multiplex groups simultaneously,
manual bin deﬁnition through a new R script (Binator),
direct bin deﬁnition through AlleloBin and ﬁle conver-
sion through CREATE.
Please, do not hesitate to send us any comments on your
experience with P2EMA and recommendations as how
it could be improved. You can get the P2EMA pipeline
and post your comments at the P2EMA project web-
page:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/p2ema/ An applica-
tion note has been submitted to Bioinformatics:

Postdoctoral Research Associate
Evolutionary genetics of plant responses to climate
2 postdoctoral positions are available in the laboratory
of Johanna Schmitt to contribute to a developing in-terdisciplinary research program investigating genetic
mechanisms of plant life history adaptation to climate.
1. A 2-3 year position, available immediately, to work
on an NSF-supported project examining the eﬀects of
genetic and environmental perturbation on life history
expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. The research will
combine ﬁeld and controlled chamber experiments ma-
nipulating germination timing, genotype, and thermal
environment with extension of a genetically informed
photothermal model (Wilczek et al., 2009, Science) to
predict eﬀects of natural variation in ﬂowering time
genes on life history expression. The research will ask:
1.How do mutational perturbation and natural varia-
tion in vernalization signaling pathways aﬀect devel-
opmental dynamics, ﬂowering time and life history ex-
pression in natural environments? 2. How does nat-
ural selection act upon this variation in natural envi-
ronments, and how does it depend upon germination
timing? 3. How will higher temperatures predicted by
global warming scenarios aﬀect life history expression
and its sensitivity to germination timing?
2. A 2 year position (with possible extension contingent
upon funding) with a ﬂexible start date, preferably by
June 2010. I am looking for a broad, creative researcher
who can complement my own expertise to help develop
new interdisciplinary projects with collaborators in at
least one of the following areas: Genetic association
analysis of a large phenotypic data set on Arabidopsis
life history traits and ﬁtness from recent ﬁeld experi-
ments in 5 European sites spanning the native climate
range; Climate envelope analysis of candidate gene al-
leles to predict future distributions under projected cli-
mate change; Integrated analysis of the adaptive evo-
lution of ﬂowering and germination time in diﬀerent
climates; Experimental ﬁeld studies of gene expression
in Arabidopsis environmental signaling pathways.
I am also interested in sponsoring applications to
the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for Feodor
Lynen Research Fellowships ( http://www.humboldt-
foundation.de/web/feodor-lynen-fellowship-postdoc.h
tml <http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/-

encourage eligible German nationals to contact me to
discuss this possibility.December 1, 2009 EvolDir 83
Requirements for these positions include a Ph.D in evo-
lutionary genetics, evolutionary ecology, plant ecology,
or plant molecular genetics, and demonstrated ability
in research design, data analysis, and writing up re-
sults for publication. Depending upon the project, ex-
perience with one or more of the following will be an
advantage: Large ﬁeld and chamber experiments; Pho-
tothermal or gene network modeling; Climate envelope

LavalU CaribouPopulationGenetics
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher interested
in the population genetics of caribou. We recently stud-
ied the connectivity of 7 caribou populations in north-
ern Quebec and Labrador (Boulet et al. 2007. Mol Ecol
16: 4223-4240) and we plan to expand this project to
a comparison of neighboring sedentary and migratory
populations in southern Quebec, Newfoundland and
the Northwest Territories. In addition, we seek to ex-
plore the phylogeography and connectivity of caribou-
reindeer at the circumpolar scale. That research will in-
volve the genetic analysis of samples of caribou-reindeer
from many parts of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Ice-
land, Norway and Russia. A better knowledge of the ge-
netic relationships between diﬀerent populations, par-
ticularly between the threatened sedentary ecotype and
migratory populations, is essential for caribou conser-
vation.
The candidate should have completed a Ph.D. in popu-
lation genetics within the last 5 years. An annual tax-
free fellowship of 35 000CAD$ is available for 1.5 year,
with a possible 6-months extension. The successful can-
didate should begin this research as soon as possible in
2010. Applications should include a letter of intent, a
C.V. and the contact details of three referees. Deadline
for applications is 15 December 2009.
This project is part of the Caribou Ungava initia-
tive which is a research program aimed at the devel-
opment of knowledge for the management and con-
servation of caribou in the context of climate change
(http://www.caribou-ungava.ulaval.ca ). It is based at
the Department of Biology of Laval University and
is part of the Centre for Northern Studies ( http://-
www.cen.ulaval.ca ). The research program focuses on
the population dynamics of caribou in northern Que-
bec and Labrador and on the impacts of industrial ac-
tivities. A multidisciplinary research team is address-
ing topics including caribou population and behavioral
ecology, plant-herbivore relationships, and population
genetics. Currently, the research staﬀ includes a pro-
fessional, ﬁve graduate students and ﬁeld technicians.For more information:

Postdoctoral position on ’The Evolution of Genomic
Obesity’ in London.
Working in a collaboration between Queen Mary, Uni-
versity of London and The Royal Botanic Gardens,
Kew.
We wish to identify the nature and genomic location
of the DNA sequences responsible for the rapid change
in genome size in the monocot genus Fritillaria. This
genus contains the largest known plant genome (Frit-
illaria assyriaca, 1C = c. 127,000 Mb, over 80 times
that of Arabidopsis thaliana). The genus also includes
species with a range of smaller genomes; evolutionary
inference about the changes in genomic composition
will be based on an existing, well supported, molecular
phylogeny.
The project will obtain new data about the sequences
responsible for these changes using 454 high throughput
sequencing and hybridize them back to chromosomal
preparations (i.e. using ﬂuorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion -FISH).
We are therefore seeking a candidate with expertise in
two areas: a) molecular genetics or cytogenetics. b)
bioinformatics
We anticipate that few candidates will be strong in both
areas, so please do not be put oﬀ if your expertise is
mainly in one of them.88 EvolDir December 1, 2009

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Evolutionary Genetics of
Autism & Schizophrenia
The ﬁelds of psychiatry and neuroscience have de-
veloped largely in isolation from social-evolutionary
theory and evolutionary genetics. A series of recent
papers from my research group has focused on the
evolutionary-genetic underpinnings of disorders of
the human social brain, most notably schizophrenia
and autism (papers 91,95,108,114-116,118,121,126
at http://www.sfu.ca/biology/faculty/crespi/-
publicationsr.html ). These papers have focused
on the roles of positive selection, genomic imprinting,
and genomic copy-number variation in the evolution
of human cognitive architecture and genetically-based
liability to disorders of the social brain. The research
centres on integration of genetic-association and
copy-number data with predictions from alterna-
tive, falsiﬁable models for the evolutionary-genomic
underpinnings of autism and schizophrenia.
One or two postdoctoral positions are available, for
research on the evolutionary genetics of autism and
schizophrenia starting in 2010. The qualiﬁed applicant
will have trained in some aspect of human genetics or
genomics at the doctoral level, and will be dedicated to
rigorous application of tools from evolutionary biology
and human evolutionary genetics to outstanding ques-
tions in the proximate and ultimate causation of autism
and schizophrenia. Positions are initially for one year,
with options for renewal.
Potential projects may include, among others:
(1) Combined analyses of positive/balancing/purifying
selection and schizophrenia or autism GWAS, to infer
functional sites and test disease-genetics models
(2) Tests of derived vs ancestral status of schizophrenia-
linked and autism-linked haplotypes
(3) Genetic studies of non-clinical populations, focus-
ing on genetic marker loci linked to both autism and
schizophrenia
(4) Meta-analyses of CNV data
(5) Analyses of family-structured disease-association
data focusing on maternal eﬀects and maternal-fetal
genotype interactions
Please send by 15 December a CV and 1-2 page state-
ment of research interests and description of skills in
human-genetic data analyses to Dr. Bernard J. Crespi,

Postdoc position in experimental evolution
We seek a postdoc for a collaborative project between
the University of Cologne (Prof. Joachim Krug) and
Wageningen University (Dr. Arjan de Visser) on epis-
tasis, recombination and the predictability of adap-
tive evolution. The project is part of the Collabora-
tive Research Center 680 “Molecular basis of evolu-
tionary innovations” funded by Deutsche Forschungsge-
meinschaft (DFG) ( http://www.sfb680.uni-koeln.de <
http://www.sfb680.uni-koeln.de/ >) and coordinated
at the University of Cologne. Using evolution experi-
ments and the reconstruction of mutational pathways
combined with population genetic theory (see de Visser
et al. 2009 Am. Nat. 174: S15-S30), we seek to de-
velop and test predictions about the molecular basis
of adaptive pathways. As experimental system we will
use TEM-1 beta-lactamase, which causes bacterial re-
sistance to certain classes of antibiotics. We want to use
this system to study the distribution of beneﬁcial mu-
tations, characterize ﬁtness landscapes involving these
mutations, study the eﬀect of recombination on the rate
and level of adaptation, and study factors that enhance
the repeatability of evolutionary pathways in replicate
populations.
Proﬁle: We seek someone with a PhD in molecular
evolutionary biology, microbial genetics or enzyme en-
gineering. Experience with basic microbiological and
molecular lab techniques are an absolute requirement;
experience with evolutionary theory and quantitative
models are an advantage. The postdoc will be ap-
pointed at the University of Cologne, and experimental
work will be carried out primarily at the Laboratory
of Genetics at Wageningen University. The initial ap-
pointment is for one year with the possibility for exten-
sion to up to four years. Salary will be paid according
to level E13 of the German public service salary scale
(TV-L).

Postdoctoral position in butterﬂy functional genomics:
identifying the mechanistic basis of ﬁtness diﬀerences
in the wild.
Dept. of Biological and Environmental Sciences / Uni-
versity of Helsinki, Helsinki Finland
Duration: 2 years, and possibly up to 4 years Funding:
Academy of Finland Gross monthly salary: 2800 - 3500
Review of applications: begins 20 November 2009 and
will continue until a suitable candidate is found.
A postdoctoral position is available to work on the func-
tional genomics of a balanced polymorphism showing
strong correlations with individual performance and ﬁt-
ness. A number of recent studies in the Glanville frit-
illary butterﬂy have documented a strong correlation
between amino acid polymorphism at the phosphoglu-
cose isomerase (Pgi) gene and increased ﬂight metabolic
rate, early adult fecundity, and deme growth rate in a
metapopulation. While much is understood about the
Pgi gene, as it catalyzes the second step of glycolysis,
this grant seeks to determine the speciﬁc genetic ba-
sis for these observed correlations and place this within
an evolutionary context. Research will involve the de-
sign and use of gene capture techniques followed by next
generation sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and pop-
ulation genetic analysis of the data. Targeted genes will
involve those of central metabolism and genes ﬂank-
ing Pgi along its chromosome. A rapidly increasing
diversity of genomic resources are becoming available
for the Glanville fritillary, with extensive EST libraries
already generated, a well functioning microarray, and
full genome sequencing well underway.The successful candidate will join the research group
of Christopher Wheat ( http://christopherwheat.net/-
) at the Department of Biological and Environmental
Sciences, University of Helsinki. A PhD and a strong
background in genetics or evolutionary biology are re-
quired. Good skills in molecular genetics and / or bioin-
formatic programming are essential. Fluency in Finnish
is not required. In addition, the postdoc will have the
opportunity to interact with members of the very in-
ternational Metapopulation Research Group ( http://-
www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop/ ).
The Department of Biological and Environmental Sci-
ences is located in a new science center with excel-
lent facilities approximately 10 minutes from downtown
Helsinki, connected by excellent public transportation.
The department has world class researchers in ecology
and evolutionary research ( http://www.helsinki.ﬁ/-
bioscience/ecology/research.htm ). Helsinki is a very
lively city, oﬀering all of the amenities one expects of
a European capitol city. Fluency in Finnish is not re-
quired, as the vast majority of Finnish people speak
excellent English.
The position is for 2 years, and potentially up to 4 de-
pending on starting date (January 2010 or soon there-
after). Contract will be renewed on an annual basis.
Gross monthly salary is Eur 2800 - 3500, depending on
experience. Salary includes occupational work health
coverage.
Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to make
informal contact with Chris Wheat as soon as possi-
ble (chris@christopherwheat.net). Applicants should
send a 1-2 page application letter stating their

ology
A graduate or postdoctoral position in evolutionary bi-
ology is available in the laboratory of Dr. W. Anthony
Frankino in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry
at the University of Houston. The position is supported
by an NSF Collaborative Grant and research will be
conducted in concert with the Dworkin and Shingle-
ton labs at Michigan State University. The successful
candidate will conduct research with all three groups.
The project entails using artiﬁcial selection to create
evolutionarily derived ﬂy lineages which will be used
to test predictions regarding the proximate basis of
morphological scaling relationship expression and evo-
lution. The derived lineages will also be used in a va-
riety of studies to elucidate the ﬁtness consequences
of variation in these scaling relationships. The project
is well suited to individuals interested in using cross-
disciplinary, integrative approaches to studying mor-
phological evolution.
The University of Houston’s existing strengths in ecol-
ogy and evolution and in mathematical biology are
complemented by close ties to other institutions in the
city, including the Texas Medical Center and Rice Uni-
versity. These ties, combined with the ongoing collab-
orations with the MSU labs, means that this position
oﬀers an intellectual environment and research oppor-
tunities that can exceed those of more typical appoint-
ments.
An ideal candidate will have proven expertise in evo-
lutionary genetics, some computational skills and a de-
sire to conduct research across laboratories in a colle-
gial environment. Experience with Drosophila is ben-
eﬁcial but not necessary. To apply, send a single PDF
ﬁle containing a letter of interest, CV, GRE scores (for
graduate applicants), and contact information for three

UKansas GeneticsComplexTraits
The Macdonald lab at KU has an opening for a post-
doc to study the genetic basis of complex trait varia-
tion. Our goal is to identify the precise causative poly-
morphisms underlying trait variation, and characterize
the evolutionary forces that act to maintain variation in
populations. We use Drosophila as a model system, and
combine experimental and computational biology ap-
proaches to investigate variation in a number of traits,
including stress- and drug- resistance, and genital mor-
phology. We also recently received additional funding
to study gene expression variation. Potential projects
include identifying QTL and eQTL in a unique map-
ping resource consisting of 1,500 genotyped 8-way RILs,
integrating phenotypic variation with both nucleotide
sequence and gene expression variation (“systems ge-
netics”), bioinformatic analyses of ﬁfteen resequenced
Drosophila genomes, and developing methods to relate
phenotype to genotype in multiparent advanced inter-
cross mapping panels. The position will provide a lot
of ﬂexibility to develop an independent line of research.
The position requires a Ph.D in evolu-
tionary/computational biology or popula-
tion/quantitative/statistical genetics, and a record of
published, peer-reviewed research in areas related to
population or quantitative genetics, or genome biology.
Depending on the project, the position would suit
individuals primarily interested in wetlab/ﬂy work, or
those with exclusively computational biology interests.
However, experimentalists must demonstrate basic
knowledge of analytical methods (e.g., Unix, Perl,
MySQL, R) given the massive phenotype/genotype
datasets we typically deal with. We do not require
that applicants have previous experience with ﬂies.
The position is open and review of applications will be-
gin immediately and continue until the position is ﬁlled.

Unique (and Low-Cost) Opportunity for Ten Under-
graduates 2010 Ecological Genetics Field Study Abroad
in China
*Learn Chinese and Ecological Genetics at the Unver-
sity of Georgia*
With funding from NSF’s Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, weare oﬀering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens or perma-
nent residents only) the opportunity to participate in a
unique study abroad opportunity in China during the
spring and summer of 2010. This is the 3rd year of the
program and students have found it to be enormously
rewarding.
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic bio-
geographic study of species that are native to China
and invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a grow-
ing number of species native to the southeastern U.S.
and invasive in China.
Each summer, we run an 8 week ﬁeld course where we
visit biological communities throughout China. After
the ﬁeld course, students can elect to continue in short-
term (3-week) research internships in our partner labs
in China.
Students will need to be prepared to take full advan-December 1, 2009 EvolDir 107
tage of this experience. Therefore, during the spring
semester, students must enroll at the University of
Georgia (UGA) and take 3 courses; two in intensive
elementary Mandarin Chinese and a laboratory course
in genetics. No prior experience with Chinese language
is required, although students should have had at least
a course in introductory biology and preferably courses
in ecology and evolutionary biology.
The cost to the student of the summer program is mini-
mal: the grant covers travel to and within China, lodg-
ing and most meals. The student is responsible for
health insurance, visa costs and personal expenses. Stu-
dents are also responsible for the costs of enrolling at
the University of Georgia for all required courses (12
credit hours) (all students are charged at the in-state
tuition rate of ~$250 per credit hour plus fees).
Applications for the 2010 program are available
on our website: http://www.genetics.uga.edu/pire/-
undergrad.html . We encourage any interested students
to contact Dr. Mauricio for more information (mauri-
cio@uga.edu).

DNA-Barcoding for taxonomic identiﬁcation is an
emerging application in biodiversity research, which al-
lows fast, objective and cheap species identiﬁcation.Practical application however, requires the building of
a reference-barcode-library, whose scientiﬁc relevance
proﬁts from the unambiguous identiﬁcation of the ref-
erence individuals by taxonomic specialists. Yet the
construction of the reference-barcode-library does not
seem to proceed in the speed possible or necessary. The
participants will learn a) meaning of barcoding in the
context of international research b) documentation of
samples c) fotographic archiving of specimen d) long
term archiving of specimen e) preparation of the tissue
for DNA-barcoding f) publishing in the barcode of life
database (BOLD). The registration fee of 100? does
not include traveling costs and accommodation. Near
the end of the workshop there will be an open for broad
public one-day symposium (March 25th , 2010). Partic-
ipants interested are welcome to present either a talk or
a poster. Invited speakers for the Symposium are Prof.
Mehrdad Hajibabaei (University of Ottawa, Canada)
and Prof. Miguel Vences (University of Braunschweig).
The workshop is limited to 20 participants and registra-
tion will open on 1st of December 2009. The registra-

The development of ?Next Generation Sequencing?-
methods is currently revolutionizing the biology. In
short time millions of sequences can easily be gener-
ated to sequence whole genomes, investigate extensive
gen expression clusters, barcode whole biological com-
munities and many more. To handle the large amount108 EvolDir December 1, 2009
of data generated many new bioinformatic tools have
been developed. These are used though mainly by
computer scientists. However ?standard? evolutionary
ecology biologists lack the necessary know-how of han-
dling these tools. This workshop is aimed out biologists
who would like to work with next generation sequencing
technologies but lack the necessary knowledge of han-
dling the data. Participants will align sequences of an
example data set, search for microsatellites, assemble
a mitochondrial genome, BLAST sequences and learn
about currently available software tools for genomic as
well transcriptomic data mining.
At the end of the workshop we have organized an one-
day symposium open for broad public (March 19th ,
2010). Participants interested are welcome to present
either a talk or a poster. Invited speakers for the Sym-
posium are Prof. Christian Schl¨ otterer (University of

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword112 EvolDir December 1, 2009
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
