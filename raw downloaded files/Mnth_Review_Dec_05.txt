lows): >After entering your email and other details as
prompted, you get a >page to select the ’product’ you
want to pay for. From the left hand >pull-down menu,
select Institute of Evolutionary Biology, and from >the
right-hand menu select Conferences, and then the lower
menu>shows the Pop Group.
There will be a late registration period of one week only,
an extra charge (absolute deadline Monday November
14th).
Information is available on the web site, but here are
some answers to the commonest questions.
Plenary speakers
Wolfgang Stephan (Munich) Population genetics ofadaptation
Gil McVean (Oxford) The causes and consequences of
human recombination hotspots
Patrice David (Montpellier) Quantitative genetics
of traits controlling selﬁng and outcrossing in
hermaphroditic snails
. Update of the information about arrival, computers
and Poster boards. Arrival Go to the Reception desk
of the James Watt Centre. They will direct you to the
Registration desk, which will be open from 2pm. The
building will be closed at 9pm, but there is a bell (on
the left of the entrance) for the night porter (all night).
The Reception desk or the night porter will give room
keys.
Guests may check in to their accommodation from 1400
on the day of arrival and are asked to vacate bedrooms
and return keys to reception by 1000 on the day of de-
parture.
The registration desk for the meeting will be open in
the main reception foyer just outside James Watt Cen-
tre from 1400-2200.
Computers The meeting rooms have a built-in projec-
tion system, and we will provide Macintosh computers
for those who prefer them. We prefer people to bring
their talks on a CD or ’data stick’ and to load them
onto one of the computers, at the latest in the break
before their session. If you are bringing your own com-
puter, however, for your talk, or other uses, remember
that non-UK equipment will require an adaptor, be-
cause UK sockets are quite diﬀerent from those else-
where in Europe.
Poster boards The boards measure 1.2m x 1.8m and
have a blue felt backing which requires posters to be
aﬃxed by using either hook velcro or pins. If you areDecember 1, 2005 EvolDir 3
presenting a poster, please email me whether it is to be
upright or ’landscape’ format.

2006 Molecular Evolution Gordon Research Conference
February 5 - 10, 2006 (Sun eve - Thurs eve) Holiday Inn,
Ventura, California
The Molecular Evolution Gordon Research Conference
is held every two years, and brings together leading ju-
nior and senior scientists from around the globe in a
small and informal conference setting to discuss cur-
rent research as well as emerging opportunities and
challenges in molecular evolution. This years meeting,
held February 5 - 10, 2006, includes recent work on onancestral protein reconstruction, computational evolu-
tionary genomics, microbial/viral diversity and evolu-
tion, evolution of body plans, sex chromosome evolu-
tion, adaptive evolution, evolution of novelty and gene
regulation, molecular evolution of interspeciﬁc hybrids,
and the evolution of the germ line. Speakers and discus-
sion leaders represent some of the leaders in experimen-
tal and computational/statistical approaches to under-
standing both the pattern and process of molecular evo-
lution and the molecular basis of diversity. The meet-
ing will be held at the Holiday Inn, Ventura California.
This ocean-side location is located in the town of Ven-
tura, and provides a wealth of opportunities to engage
in scientiﬁc interaction and at the same time explore
on foot the beaches, town, and adjacent hills. Whale-
watching, winery tours, the Getty Museum and other
attractions are nearby. All scientists with an interest in
molecular evolution, and comparative and evolutionary
genomics are encouraged to attend the conference. We
particularly encourage participants to present posters
on their research, and there will be ample opportuni-
ties for discussion and informal interaction.
We hope you will join us! Please also circulate this
meeting info to colleagues, postdocs and students at
your institution who may be interested in attending.
Applications and registration for the meeting is done
through the GRC website ( http://www.GRC.org ). The
size of the meeting is capped to keep it small and inter-
active. Thus, space is limited so please register soon!
Please contact either of us if you have questions.

Daphnia Genomics Consortium - Meeting 2006
January 17 through 19, 2006 Indiana University,
Bloomington, Indiana
Conference Website: http://-
conferences.cgb.indiana.edu/daphnia2006 This
meeting of the Daphnia Genomics Consortium will be
held on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University.
This gathering will commemorate the beginning of the
long-term project of understanding the structure and
biology of the newly sequenced Daphnia genome and
will map out future research directions.
The meeting will bring together an interdisciplinary
group of distinguished researchers. The prospects for
utilizing the Daphnia genome are vast: members of the
Daphnia Genomics Consortium use Daphnia as a model
system across areas of biology including genetics, evo-
lution, ecology, ecotoxicology, and aquatic biology. The
release of the draft genome sequence will further thrust
each of these research areas into the current age of ge-
nomics and will add the ﬁrst crustacean to the growing
list of characterized arthropod genomes.
There are opportunities for participants to present orig-
inal research in the form of talks or posters on recent
studies in genomics or advances in genomic approaches,
especially in relation to evolutionary ecology.
We invite interested researchers to attend, even if you
are not (yet!) a member of the Consortium. If other
researchers have studies or techniques that will enhance
our view of the possibilities in using Daphnia, we cer-
tainly encourage your participation.
IMPORTANT DATES:
November 1, 2005 - Registration opens (registration fee
$125) December 1, 2005 - last date for abstract submis-
sion; registration fee increases to $150

******************
First International Conference on Phylogenomics
Dates: March 16-19 2006 Location: Sainte-Ad` ele
(near Montreal), Qu´ ebec, Canada Web site:
http://www.bioinfo.umontreal.ca/evenements/-
phylogenomics.html Organizers: Herv´ e Philippe
and Mathieu BlanchetteScope: This conference aims to reunite experts focus-
ing on two distinct aspects of phylogenomics: the use
of genome data inferring species phylogeny and the use
of phylogenetic approaches to gain insights into gene
functions. The methods developed for phylogenetic in-
ference (especially the models of sequence evolution)
are quite advanced and could beneﬁt to function pre-
diction. Similarly, the knowledge of the accurate species
phylogeny increases the quantity of functional informa-
tion that can be extracted. Conversely, knowledge of
gene function and the other selective constraints is pri-
mordial to improve tree reconstruction methods. This
conference will create synergy between these two phy-
logenomic communities, bridging the gap between there
respective scientiﬁc endeavors. A special issue of BMC
Evolutionary Biology will be dedicated to the confer-
ence, allowing contributors of the conference to submit
their manuscripts.

Forensic Analysis of Feathers from Maori Cloaks Su-
pervisors: Prof David Lambert, Craig Millar and Leon
Huynen, Allan Wilson Centre, Auckland, New Zealand
We have a research programme underway to identify
the species and geographic provenance of birds used to
construct Maori cloaks. These data can then be used
to test ideas about how cloaks were constructed, for ex-
ample to determine if skins were traded in order to con-
struct them. Ideally a Maori student from New Zealand
should work on this programme. However, other suit-
able applicants would be considered.

sequences from the 5’ end of this molecule have been
widely used for the barcoding of animals. The student
will also work with our DNA sequencing technician to
conduct this large-scale study.

(ﬁrst appearance here on EvolDir on Sept. 1, 2006),
we will extend application period until the position is
ﬁlled. Pls distribute widely to potential applicants.

G¨ ottingen, Germany: Research Associate (PhD) posi-
tion in molecular phylogenetics and phylogenomics.
We invite applications for a research associate (PhD)
position in a project funded by the German Research
Foundation (DFG) A combined phylogenomic and
palaeontological approach to resolve deep phylogenetic
incongruences among Phylum Porifera“ in the newly es-
tablished DFG Priority Programme 1174: ”Deep Meta-
zoan Phylogeny“ The project is located in the Depart-
ment of Geobiology (Working group of Junior Prof. Dr.
Gert W¨ orheide) of the Geoscience Centre of the Univer-
sity of G¨ ottingen (Germany). The Dept. of Geobiologyis also part of the G¨ ottingen Centre for Biodiversity and
Ecology.
The phylogenetic relationships among lower metazoan
groups (i.e. diploblast taxa Porifera, Ctenophora,
Cnidaria) are still under hot debate and are far from
being resolved. Uncertainty also exists about whether
poriferans (sponges) are monophyletic or paraphyletic.
If the latter turns out to be corroborated, it has signiﬁ-
cant implications for the evolution of ”higher“ animals,
as it would suggest that the most recent common an-
cestor of Eumetazoa was similar to an adult sponge.
This project will use, for the ﬁrst time, a combined
phylogenomic, bioinformatic and palaeontological ap-
proach aiming to resolve phylogenetic incongruences at
the base of the metazoan tree and ﬁrmly date clado-
geneses and ﬁrst appearances of poriferan clades. The
main responsibilities of the successful candidate will be
1) to construct cDNA libraries of major poriferan lin-
eages and prepare for large scale EST sequencing; 2)
to work towards a multi-marker molecular phylogeny
of main poriferan lineages; 3) to carry out phyloge-
nomic analyses of EST- and genome sequences. This
project will be carried out in close collaboration with
Prof. Morgenstern (Bioinformatics) and Prof. Reitner
(Precambrian/Cambrian diploblast fossil record)
We are seeking a highly motivated applicant with excel-
lent molecular- phylogenetic skills, both in the lab and
in silico, demonstrated by an above-average MSc (or
equivalent, e.g. German Diplom”) degree in a related
ﬁeld.
The successful candidate will join a young and dynamic
lab focussing on micro- and macroevolution in marine
invertebrates. More information about the lab can be
found at www.geobiology.nu . The opportunity to enrol
in the new PhD study course Biodiversity and Ecology“
will be given.
Requirements: Degree in Biology (MA, MSc, or equiv-
alent degree) or related ﬁeld; very good and demon-
strated knowledge of molecular lab techniques and
understanding of molecular evolution including meth-
ods to infer molecular phylogenies and state-of-the art
computer programs for such analyses; excellent En-
glish language skills. Good working knowledge of
UNIX/LINUX and Perl or Python desirable but not
essential.
The position is available for 2 years (with possible
extension depending upon performance and available
funding) and will be paid according to the German
BATIIa salary scheme (part time).
Application: Send application including letter of in-
tent, CV, PDF’s of publications (if available), and12 EvolDir December 1, 2005
details of 2 referees as PDF (only) by email or
snail mail to Gert W¨ orheide (gert.woerheide@geo.uni-

GoteborgU PipeﬁshEvolution
ANNOUNCEMENT: PhD Student Position in Animal
Ecology at Dept of Zoology, G¨ oteborg University, Swe-
den
Biologists that have graduated in zoology, evolutionary
or behavioural ecology (or nearby areas), interested in
post graduate studies for a PhD degree in Animal Ecol-
ogy are encouraged to apply.
You will be working with behavioural and evolution-
ary ecology studies in a project on brood reduction
in a pipeﬁsh (Syngnathus typhle). Pipeﬁshes belongto the same family as seahorses, but in contrast to
seahorses, which are predominantly monogamous, this
pipeﬁsh is highly polygamous. However, in common
with seahorses they show paternal care by carrying
the eggs in a brood pouch from mating to parturi-
tion. Yet, for unknown reasons some oﬀspring do
not develope successfully. The focus of the project is
to understand the major reasons for such reduction
in oﬀspring numbers and the consequences of it for
sexual selection, both before and after mating. The
project is carried out in collaboration with researchers
from Uppsala and Texas A&M Universities and involves
ﬁeld work at Kristineberg Marine Reseach Station
(http://www.kmf.gu.se/index general info.html ) at the
Swedish west coast.
Preferred qualiﬁcations: MSc (or equivalent) in biol-
ogy with a ﬁnished graduate project (worth 20 weeks
of studies, or more, with a written report/thesis) with
an ecological or evolutionary focus. Experience from
behavioural ecology studies is meriting, as is an inter-
est in physiological processes. We are looking for a PhD
student who is interested in theory as much as empiri-
cal work, has a good analytical capacity and is able to
take initiatives.
The PhD studies are planned to start 1 February 2006
(or as agreed upon). For fulltime studies funding is
given as a stipend for the ﬁrst two years and as a po-
sition for the following two years. Normally the PhD
student will do 20% teaching and supervision of under-
graduates, which extends the period of PhD studies to
a total of approx. ﬁve years.
For more information, please contact main su-
pervisor Professor Charlotta Kvarnemo, e-mail
lotta.kvarnemo@zoologi.su.se (until 30 November
2005)/ lotta.kvarnemo@zool.gu.se (from 1 December

Groningen EvolPhysiology
The research group Animal Ecology of the research in-
stitute Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies
(Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Univer-
sity of Groningen) has a vacancy for a full-time PhD-
position:
PhD Project title “Solutions to seasonal challenges: the
interplay between immune function and energetics in
avian life history”
Seasonal challenges have frequently been invoked as ex-
planation for diﬀerences in life histories among bird
species, but knowledge of seasonal patterns of self-
maintenance and disease, and understanding of the un-
derlying physiological mechanisms are incomplete. This
project aims to examine how birds cope with environ-
mental challenges through an integrated study of en-
ergetics and immune function in desert, tropical and
temperate environments. These environments have dif-
ferent seasonal patterns in climate, resource availabil-
ity and risk of disease. Seasonally recurrent challenges
include food and water shortages combined with high
ambient temperatures during desert summers, and food
shortages and low temperatures during temperate zone
winters, whereas tropical areas are benign yearround.
We hypothesize that during the most stressful season,
e.g. desert summers and temperate zone winters, free-
living birds may be forced to compromise immune func-
tion because they cannot meet its presumed energy re-
quirements.
Job description
This project compares lark species from desert, tropical
and temperate areas, and in addition provides scope for
intraspeciﬁc studies on one or two lark species. Usinga combination of laboratory and ﬁeld energetics, and
new immunological assays for ﬁeld studies, you will as-
sess overall levels and seasonal patterns of metabolic
rate and immune function. In addition, you will in-
vestigate the links between metabolism and immune
function with ﬁeld and lab experiments.
Requirements
We are looking for a broad-minded candidate with an
interest to integrate information from diﬀerent levels of
biological organization, and the aspiration to cooperate
in an international team. Ideally, you are a passionate
ﬁeld ecologist, with aﬃnity with physiological, micro-
biological and biochemical laboratory work. You will
be excited by the prospect of working in often mentally
demanding and harsh climate conditions in the Middle
East and Africa, besides ﬁeldwork in the Netherlands.
You have experience with ﬁeldwork, and a driver’s li-
cense.

Ph.D. Studentship - Experimental host-parasite coevo-
lution in yeast. NERC Center for Population Biology,
Imperial College London
We are looking for a Ph.D. student to study host-
parasite coevolution in experimental and natural pop-
ulations of yeast. Many strains of yeast are infected
with intracellular genetic parasites (DNA plasmids and
RNA viruses) that replicate at the expense of their host.
Although geneticists have known about these parasites
for a long time, little is known about their ecology and
evolution. We outline some of the interesting questions
that we think could be investigated with this system
below, although these could easily be changed depend-
ing on the interests of the student. The studentship is
funded by NERC (UK) and the student will be based
at the NERC Center for Population Biology located
at the Silwood Park campus of Imperial College Lon-
don. The Center for Population Biology oﬀers students
access to an outstanding group of researchers in evolu-
tion and ecology aswell as excellent lab facilities. This
position is ideal for students who would like to carry
out independent research project in a stimulating and
challenging environment. Experience in microbiology
and molecular biology are assets, but they are not re-

Research topics
1) What aﬀect do the elements have on the host cell,
both alone and in combination? The DNA plasmid has
been shown to reduce replication rates by about 2%,
but what about the others?
2) How does the copy number of these elements within
the infected cell change over the yeast life cycle? In par-
ticular, does the entry of yeast into sexual phases of the
life cycle trigger parasite replication as an adaptation
to swamp competitors in a potential mate?
3) Sex and the evolution of copy number. Simple theory
suggests that in outcrossed populations the elements
will evolve higher copy number than inbred popula-
tions, as an adapation to compete against unrelatedelements in the mate. Increased parasite virulence in
sexual populations may select for hosts with increased
defense against parasites.
4) The frequency and population dynamics of killer
viruses. A nonautonomous variant of one of the viruses
encodes a killer toxin and antitoxin, so that yeast cells
with this viral variant kill those without. What is the
frequency of this variant among the natural isolates?
If populations are polymorphic, how are the two types
arranged spatially?
5) What is the frequency of each of these parasites in
natural populations, and is the presence of any one cor-
related with the presence/absence of any other (this
would be suggestive of interactions among the para-
sites).

creasing the prevalence of dengue virus diseases in de-
veloping countries.
We are looking for a PhD student who is interested
in conducting research aimed at driving anti-pathogen
genes (refractoriness) into mosquito populations. The
main emphasis of the student’s research can be in
the areas of 1) estimating ecological parameters in
mosquito life histories that will impact the spread of
anti-pathogen transgenes, 2) building population ge-
netics models of gene drive mechanisms, 3) estimating
mosquito population structure through use of molecu-
lar genetic approaches, or could work on a project that
combines two or more of the above areas. The stu-
dent could either become a member of the Entomology
or the Genetics Department and North Carolina State
University.
Our lab is funded by NIH and the Gates Founda-
tion and is part of an interdisciplinary group composed
of mosquito ecologists, geneticists, disease epidemiolo-
gists, molecular biologists, ethicists, and scientists from
disease-endemic countries, all working to develop novel
transgenic strategies for disease reduction. The student
in this position will focus on a speciﬁc project but will
also interact with members of this team and thereby
acquire a broad understanding of the challenges facing
scientists who want to move their research from the lab
bench all the way to successful implementation.
An overview of this area of research and an entry point
to the literature can be found in

Evolution of Sexual Communication Systems in Moths16 EvolDir December 1, 2005
Background Information: Most night-ﬂying moth
species locate mates through production of, and re-
sponse to, a very precise blend of two or more volatile
chemical compounds. Within a population, females
with atypical blends have been shown to be less at-
tractive to males than females with the population’s
common blend. Similarly, rare males that respond to
atypical blends have been found to be at a disadvantage
in ﬁnding mates. The genes that control pheromone
blend ratios have never been found to be linked to, or
aﬀect male response, so mutations that cause changes
in each of the two components of communication are
expected to arise independently. On a simple theoret-
ical level, this type of sexual communication system is
expected to be evolutionarily constrained because an
individual with a mutation leading to an altered blend
or response will be selected against, when rare. Even
if the selective disadvantage to rare individuals with
alleles for novel signals or responses is minimal, mass
selection is not expected to increase their frequency in
the population. Based on these assumptions it is diﬃ-
cult to account for the great diversiﬁcation of chemical
mixtures used in mate communication by over 10,000
moth species. We are investigating a number of poten-
tial evolutionary mechanisms that could have resulted
in this diversiﬁcation by dissecting the genetic under-
pinnings of selective mating in moths.
We are working with two sympatric moth species (He-
liothis virescens and Heliothis subﬂexa) that have very
distinct sex pheromone blends, do not mate in the wild,
but can be induced to mate in the lab. We have mapped
a number of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) that control
production of speciﬁc female sex pheromone compo-
nents and male response to these components. We have
moved two speciﬁc QTL between species and tested
their impacts on mating in the ﬁeld. We have also iden-
tiﬁed a number of candidate genes that appear to be
involved in male response to speciﬁc pheromone com-
ponents.
We are now in a good position to test candidate genes
and to determine the genetic and molecular basis for
diﬀerences between the sexual communication systems
of these two moth species. We are looking for a PhD
student who has basic knowledge of molecular tech-
niques and wants to use these techniques to answer
questions about insect evolution.

aimed at reconstructing the phylogeny of the Crustacea.
Among the arthropods, the crustaceans hold special
status as the morphologically and ecologically most di-18 EvolDir December 1, 2005
verse group. However, a consensus on their high level
relationships remains elusive. Moreover, recent phylo-
genetic evidence hints at the possibility that the most

Whale bone taphonomy: burrows, borings and Osedax
NERC - CASE award with The Natural History Mu-
seum, London
Dr. Crispin Little, School of Earth and Environment,
University of Leeds Dr. Adrian Glover, Department of
Zoology, The Natural History Museum, London
Background. When whales die, they sink to the
seaﬂoor, creating an enormous point-source of organic
enrichment and food for benthic scavenging organisms.
Research using both natural whale-falls’ and implanted
remains of dead specimens has highlighted the diver-
sity of fauna that colonizes these remains, which in-
cludes both whale-fall specialists and organisms that
are also associated with chemosynthetic environments
such as hydrothermal vents and seeps (Smith & Baco
2003; Rouse et al. 2004; Glover et al. 2005).
The project. This PhD will focus on the recently dis-
covered whale- fall endemic genus Osedax, a soft-bodied
polychaete worm that has been described from mod-
ern whale-fall communities (Rouse et al. 2004; Glover
et al. 2005). This bizarre animal has no gut as an
adult but grows a system of root-like tubes into freshly
exposed whale bone by an unknown process to ’mine’
lipids, which are broken down by the intracellular sym-
bionts inside the worm. Evidence from molecular ge-
netics suggests that Osedax arose at least 40 millionyears ago, in the late Eocene (Rouse et al. 2004). The
principal aim of the project is to determine the nature
of the Osedax burrow, and to use this information to
investigate the presence of Osedax in known fossilized
whale-falls (Amano & Little 2005). Additional aims
are to investigate the method of burrowing using live
specimens held in aquaria, and to determine the or-
ganism responsible for microborings in modern and an-
cient whale bones. The project will involve oceano-
graphic and palaeontological ﬁeldwork in Sweden, UK,
USA and Japan.
The candidate. The project is open to candidates
with a good ﬁrst degree in marine biology, oceanog-
raphy, zoology or palaeontology with a strong biolog-
ical background. The location is ﬂexible, but it is
anticipated that project time will be split 50/50 be-
tween institutions. Further details and how to ap-
ply. Please visit the University of Leeds website

PhD Position in population genetics, The University

tralia
Mediterranean white and conical snails (Cernuella vir-
gata, Theba pisana and Cochlicella spp.) are signiﬁ-
cant pests of grain crops in coastal regions of southern
Australia. Existing control methods, including burn-
ing of stubble prior to sowing crops, cabling to dislodge
snails from aestivation sites, biological control (para-
sitoid of conical snails only) and chemical control have
been only partially successful. A method of snail con-
trol that reduces our reliance on chemical pesticides
and is species-speciﬁc would be highly desirable. The
current project will investigate the genetic structure of
the pest snail populations and reproductive strategy,
in order to determine the suitability for future genetic
control methods. The project is a joint venture between
CSIRO, The University of Melbourne and the Grains
Research and Development Corporation. The PhD
student will be based at the University of Melbourne
Department of Genetics and will receive training in
ﬁeld work, molecular techniques and population genet-
ics. The student will be required to undertake ﬁeld
work in South Australia and this necessitates a valid
Drivers Licence. Applicants will have a bachelorˆ as de-
gree with honours in biological science (speciﬁcally ge-
netics). This is a full-time scholarship with a maximum
of 3 years funding available, contingent on satisfactory
progress. The stipend is valued at AUD$25,000 per an-
num. To obtain further information contact Dr Belinda
Appleton (b.appleton@unimelb.edu.au) or Dr Rod Ma-
hon (Rod.Mahon@csiro.au) Applications including a
curriculum vitae citing relevant studies and/or expe-
rience, a short statement of research interests, the
names and addresses of three professional referees, and
a copy of an oﬃcial academic record/transcript should

Doctoral Position in Behavioural and Molecular Ecol-
ogy of Facultatively Eusocial Bees
The Department of Environmental Sciences (UWIS),
ETH Zentrum, Zurich, Switzerland invites applica-
tions for the above post, available for three years from
1st January 2006 or shortly thereafter, to study be-
havioural and molecular ecology in Halictid bees. The
project will be supervised by Drs Jaboury Ghazoul and
Carlos Lopez-Vaamonde.
The aim of the project is to investigate the nesting be-
haviour of facultatively eusocial bees to ask questions
about the extent of nest co-occupancy and the biologi-
cal and environmental conditions under which this oc-
curs, the beneﬁts and costs of such behaviour, the ﬁt-
ness associated with alternative nesting strategies, and
genetic relatedness among individuals within an aggre-
gation and among nest sharers. Methods will include
behavioural observations of marked individuals of natu-
ral colonies of Halictine bees, manipulations of the com-
position of natural colonies, and typing of individuals
at hypervariable microsatellite DNA loci.
Applicants should be highly-motivated researchers with
ecological training and appropriate qualiﬁcations. Ex-
perience of social insect biology and/or analysis of mi-
crosatellite DNA loci would be an advantage. The sci-
entiﬁc working language is English of which good spo-
ken and written ability is required. Knowledge of Ger-
man and/or would be advantageous but not necessary.
The work will be based at ETH Zurich, Switzerland un-
der the supervision of Drs Jaboury Ghazoul and Car-
los Lopez-Vaamonde. Jaboury Ghazoul is professor of
Ecosystem Management at ETH Zurich. Carlos Lopez-
Vaamonde is researcher at the Forestry Zoology Unit,
INRA Orleans, France. Extended periods of ﬁeldwork
will be necessary at sites in France and Switzerland.

with local and international institutions. It is consis-
tently ranked among the top universities in the world.
Zurich is a cosmopolitan city with one of the highest
ratings for quality of life and good international con-
nections.

INRA France SeniorScientist
A permanent CR2 position in population genetics and
ecology will be opened at the INRA, Research Unit
UGAPF (Forage Crops Genetics Unit).
Research theme Grasslands are genetically complex
structure. Various perennial or annual species may be
present. In each grassland perennial species, a wide
range of genetic variation is present and genetic changes
are taking place, leading to changes of agronomic value
as possibly generating environmental impacts. Grass-
lands are perennial stands but may be experimented
and specially designed genetic populations may be con-
structed. Temporary grasslands are an adequate tool
for study of grassland population genetics.
In order to understand the genetic changes taking place
within grasslands swards, the objective of this new po-
sition is to strengthen work on population genetics ap-
plied to grasslands. The research program proposed
for the new position will be to describe, understandand model demographic and genetic changes in peren-
nial grasslands swards focussing on dominant grassland
species (forage grasses and legumes) and taking into
account competition within and among plant species,
sexual reproduction and recruitment of seedlings. The
candidate is expected to have a good backgroung in
population genetics and ecology and interest in theo-
retical and modelling approaches.
Scientiﬁc environment The succesful candidate will
work in close collaboration with the researchers in-
volved in grasslands research in the Unit (3 molecu-
lar geneticists, 2 quantitative geneticists), will be in-
tegrated into the local network for studying grassland
ecophysiology, environmental impact and production of
grasslands (Ecophysiology Unit (7 scientists), Observa-
tory for Research in Environment) and in collaborative
programs (ANR Discover). The locally available techni-
cal resources include molecular biology lab, greenhouses
and growth rooms, ﬁeld experiments.
Full details on application procedure will appear on
INRA web site ( www.inra.fr ) in late december 2005. It
is anticipated that deadline for applications will be in
late February 2006. Applications must include CV, de-
tailed research achievements and a proposal of research
project for the oﬀered position.

ABI3100 CapillaryReInstallationDecember 1, 2005 EvolDir 49
dear all,
we encountered a dramatic loss of quality when chang-
ing capillaries (e.g. exchanging the 36 cm to 50 cm) and
installing the 36cm capillary again after some days; res-
olution was very bad from 150bp onwards; also when
reinstalling the 50cm array this had bad quality from
200bp on.
We stored the arrays at room temperature in the lab
on the shelf.
Can anybody give me some hints on changing and stor-
ing capillaries on the ABI 3100?
Thanks Walter

Alabama ID
Brian,
Could you post the following on evoldir?
Thanks, Jerry
If you’ve been following the news, you’ll see that ID has
recently made substantial inroads in the public con-
sciousness. Although we had a small win in Dover,
the Kansas shenanigans have reappeared, and the pro-
ID “warning sticker” about evolution in Alabama was
passed without a single opposing voice from the public
(see story below). Where were Alabama’s scientists?
The Pope has also spoken up in favor of intelligent de-
sign.
Although all of us dislike having to ﬁght these battles,
I think it’s time for all of us to organize locally and dowhat we can. The IDers are going to make their stand
on the local level, and local scientists will be required
to oppose them.
Please consider doing what you can if you have such a
controversy in your state.
Thanks, Jerry Coyne
Alabama keeps its disclaimer on evolution School board
approves statement calling it a ’controversial’ theory
Updated: 9:20 p.m. ET Nov. 10, 2005
MONTGOMERY, Ala. - The state school board voted
unanimously Thursday to keep a disclaimer in biology
textbooks that describes evolution as “a controversial
theory” after no one in the audience disputed the label,
which has generated heated debate in the past.
The board, in its vote to accept a committee’s rec-
ommendations of science textbooks, agreed to continue
carrying the disclaimer, which calls evolution “contro-
versial” in the ﬁrst paragraph and adds in the second
that any statement about the origin of life is “not fact.”
State Superintendent Joe Morton, who recommended
keeping the label in the texts, said he wasn’t surprised
that the subject received no discussion during the por-
tion of the meeting devoted to public comment.
“I think people have generally reached a level of com-
fort with where we are,” he said. “It’s not like it just
came up in Alabama - there’s been 10 years of history
associated with this.”
School board member Betty Peters agreed, saying the
lack of public debate was “because the insert has
worked out.”
Tired of battling? But Randall Johnson, who was a
member of a 2001 panel charged with revising the sci-
ence course of study, said supporters of the evolution
theory are simply tired of battling the school board.
Johnson was the only member of the panel to oppose
the disclaimer.
“They know nothing is going to be done about it,” said
Johnson, who is the director of the Alabama Surface
Mining Commission.
But, Johnson added, if calling evolution a controversial
theory is “the only negative thing that comes out of
(the disclaimer), that’s not all that bad.”
“They could have required the teaching of intelligent
design or banned the teaching of evolution altogether,”
he said.
Board members said the purpose of the disclaimer is
to give room to teachers who want to discuss alterna-
tive theories. “Teachers do have some concerns about50 EvolDir December 1, 2005
that,” said school board member Randy McKinney.
He said that often teachers who want to teach alter-
natives to evolution, such as creationism or intelligent
design, hesitate to do so, in fear of overstepping rules
on the separation of church and state.
Upset about evolution? Intelligent design argues that
natural selection, an element of evolutionary theory,
cannot fully explain the origin of life or the emergence
of highly complex life forms. Critics of intelligent de-
sign and creationism say they do not belong in a science
curriculum.
Board members said teaching evolution will remain an
issue that stirs convictions. They pointed to Kansas,
where new science standards for public schools are get-
ting national attention because critics see them as an
attack on teaching evolution.
“I think people are upset about evolution all over Amer-
ica - it’s a controversial topic,” said Peters, who encour-
ages teachers to teach alternative theories in addition
to evolution.
Alabama remains the only state that carries such a
sticker, according to the National Center for Science
Education, which defends the teaching of evolution.
Other states, including Georgia and Arkansas, tried
similar stickers but are ﬁghting legal battles over keep-
ing them.
Three books rejected The 23-member textbook com-
mittee, which includes 14 educators, recommended
dozens of science textbooks to be approved by the
school board for Alabama students, but rejected three
elementary-level books for containing material on evo-
lution that was deemed “controversial” for that age
group.
The books were considered supplementary readers,
meaning they could not be used as the sole textbook
in the science curriculum.
Each of the three elementary books that were rejected
discussed evolution and natural selection, which were
regarded “controversial material at a grade level that is
not developmentally ready for such controversial mate-
rial,” according to a series of Sept. 28 memos sent to
school board members.

Natural History Miscellany submissions should be

Ambiguous alignments answers
Hi everybody, here are the answers to my “ambiguos
alignments”-post. Thanx to everyone who replied!
******
I’ve attached an article by Francois Lutzoni et al.,
Systematic Biology 2000. 49 (4): 628-651, that ad-
dresses this
problem. There may be other articles in this volume of
Sys
Bio that are of interest as well
You might look for papers by Franois Lutzoni, who did
some interesting recoding of variable regions in introns
(or maybe in IESs).
Paper was within last 4 years...December 1, 2005 EvolDir 51
The program INAASE (Lutzoni et al. 2000?) (google
it) assigns step matrices for ambiguously aligned re-
gions - check it out?
******
Comment: The Lutzoni et al. approach was designed
for Maximum Parsimony. I’m not sure if it’s appropi-
ate in model-based frameworks. Furthermore, it also
leads to a loss of information, because positional ho-
mology is completely ignored in ambiguous regions, as
I understand it. Instead, all gaps are removed and ev-
ery type of sequence is treated as a seperate character.
Thus, the number of characters is reduced. I think, if
the ambiguous region one is dealing with is short and
contains few conserved blocks“, this might be worth
checking out. But for longer regions that contain large
conserved blocks - such as in my case, where the in-
group taxa form a conserved block and only the few
outgroup taxa are unalignable to the ingroup - the loss
of information would be too high.
******
I have a similar issue and have tentatively concluded
that it is okay to do as you suggested. As far as I can
tell, it is not the amount of missing data that matters,
but rather how much data is present. I have attached
a few papers here that could be of use. Perhaps you
know them already? The Wiens papers address the is-
sue of missing data in general, and the Lutzoni paper
has a small section in the introduction regarding coding
ambiguously aligned regions as missing data.
******
Comment: For the Lutzoni paper, see above. The
Wiens papers (see below) are very interesting. J.J.
Wiens conducted a number of simulation studies, and
the general outcome seems to be that it’s indeed not
the amount of missing data that can pose a problem.
If enough information is present, phylogenetic accuracy
is maintained, even if there are missing data. Actu-
ally, accuracy can be increased by keeping incomplete
taxa or characters, because the overall number of data
points is higher than in a total exclusion” approach.
But check them out yourself:
Wiens, J. J. 2003. Incomplete taxa, incomplete char-
acters, and phylogenetic accuracy: Is there a missing
data problem? J. Vert. Pal. 23:297-310.
Wiens, J. J. 2003. Missing data, incomplete taxa, and
phylogenetic accuracy. Syst. Biol. 52:528-538.
Wiens, J. J. 2005. Missing data and the design of phy-
logenetic analyses. Journal of Biomedical Informatics
(in press)
see also:Wiens, J. J. 1998. Does adding characters with missing
data increase or decrease phylogenetic accuracy? Syst.
Biol. 47:625-640.
******
I see this ass a risky strategy, because it is not clear in
most cases how phylogenetic methods behave in the face
of missing data points. You might consider comparing
the output of your method when omitting ambiguous
regions altogether with the inclusion strategy you are
suggesting. If inclusion of the region, while omitting
only the data from taxa making alignments ambigu-
ous, changes any of the well- supported inferences of
monophyly from the exclusionary analysis, then I would
question the results of the inclusionary strategy.
******
Comment: Testing alternative alignments is always a
good idea and should be done in any case (unless there’s
absolutely no ambiguity in your data...). But I think
the results of an exclusionary strategy could as well
be questioned, if the results from the two strategies
are not compatible, given that the presence of too few
characters can decrease phylogenetic accuracy. If the
results of Wiens’ simulation studies (see above) are ap-
plicable to real data (which is not too far fetched...), I
would always prefer the inclusionary strategy, because
it maximizes the amount of characters.
However, there might be no general advice. I think,
it depends on the particular dataset you are analysing,
and these issues might diﬀer from case to case.
Unfortunately, nobody had any idea concerning the ef-
fect of missing OUTGROUP information for some char-
acters. This might be a problem because character-
states of the ingroup can’t be correctly polarized. But
does it pose a problem, when there are overall enough
data from the outgroups? That is, how robust are phy-
logenetic analyses to this special case of missing data?
Any ideas?

at my institutute. Any pointers in this direction would
be greatly appreciated.

Hi:
I need to apply an assignment test for diﬀerent popu-
lations, but I have many questions
1- Is it possible to use assignment test for allozymes
data??
2- What is the best software for assignment test?
3- Using Arlequin software I get the likelihood for geno-
types, but I don’t get any probability to look for sta-
tistical diﬀerences in the genotypes asigned. How can I
get that probability?
4. Using Arlequin, How do I do plotting, for example
to plott the log-likelihood of individual sampled, what
value of those that the sofware give me should I use
as coordenates?, How do I choose one, are there any
arguments to make the choice?Many thanks,

Azteca ant samples
Hello Evoldir people,
I’m currently studying dispersal and species coexis-
tence in ants inhabiting Cordia nodosa in Peru. To do
this, I need to sort out the various Azteca ant species
(Dolichoderinae) that we ﬁnd on this plant. Thus,
I would need some samples of other Azteca species
(at least 5 individuals/species) from other myrmeco-
phytic trees for comparisons and a phylogeny. If you
can help me, please contact me at this email address:

BeckmanCoulter vs
AppliedBiosystems answers
Dear Evoldir Members, Thanks very much for your
replies to my recent question concerning the diﬀerences
between Beckman Coulter and Applied Biosystems cap-
illary machines. This seems to be a popular question,
which comes up every 3-6 months. In the pages be-
low, I have included all the responses I received, as
well as previous responses to similar questions in the
past year. I have removed names from the comments,
to protect conﬁdentiality. The comments concerning
the CEQ8000 range widely from ’I have a Beckman
CEQ8000 and absolutely love it.’ to ’I am ready to
throw my CEQ8000 out the friggin’ window!’. At this
point, we haven’t decided which way to go, but we
greatly appreciate your input.
-Sincerely Mike Goodisman

Dear Evoldir readers, We are considering purchasing a
BECKMAN COULTER CEQ 8000 series Genetic Anal-
ysis System for microsatellite genotyping and sequenc-ing, and moving away from the comparable APPLIED
BIOSYSTEMS machines (e.g., 3100, 3130, 3170). How-

————————-
We have used both the CEQ8000 and the ABI3730 in-
struments for sequencing and fragment analysis. They
are both good and reliable instruments. We found the
instrument cost of the CEQ8000 to be very attrac-
tive. Unfortunately, the reagent costs for the CEQ8000
are more expensive (in our hands the ABI sequenc-
ing reagents can be diluted to 1:16) which may change
if other companies start making these speciﬁc dyes.
We started doing high-throughput sequencing and the
CEQ8000 was unable to meet our needs. Otherwise, we
probably would have stayed with the CEQ8000. Hope
this helps.
————————–
We have used the CEQ8000 for a couple of years now
and are VERY satisﬁed with it. I’m analysing mi-
crosatellites and it’s working extremely well (after op-
timising of course). The people using it for sequencing
are very happy with it too. I can really recommend
it. After what I’ve heard the ABI is good too but we
got a better deal for our money buying the CEQ. The
software for analysing the fragments are included in the
system and after what I’ve heard it costs a lot to get
that extra for the ABI. That’s something to consider
too.
————————–
I have a Beckman CEQ8000 and absolutely love it. It
has been very robust, easy to use, straight-forward to
calibrate for our conditions etc. We used it all summer -
actually I had 2 undergrads using it - I hardly touched
it. We have had a couple of minor problems with it,
mostly user errors, and the service people are terriﬁc -
the technical people as well. Beckman has been great
to work with overall.
Capillary and gel costs are relatively high ( ~$480 per
capillary array and ~$90 per plate of gel) but my mem-
ory of using the ABI system during my postdoc is that54 EvolDir December 1, 2005
it is also very expensive. One nice thing about the
Beckman is that you do not have to change anything
to do sequencing - as a matter of fact we ran a plate
with mostly microsatellites and a row of sequence and
it worked great. We also ran our capillary way past the
100 run limit with no problems at all. The WellRED
phosphoramidite dye system is not yet common so you
are a little stuck using Beckman’s sequencing kit and
fragment standard but eventually that will be available
elsewhere. I haven’t done a ton of data analysis on it yet
but once you get past the user interface (which really
isn’t that tough) it seems to be very ﬂexible and pow-
erful - many diﬀerent parameters you can work with.
We eventually plan to have our system on a rolling cart
- no need to worry about lasers getting out of whack
etc...
I highly recommend the CEQ 8000 - let me know if I
can give you any other information...

Bootstraped NJtree
Dear Evoldir members,
I would like to draw an unrooted neighbour-joining tree
with 33 populations of my study animal Rana esculenta.
Since these frogs are hybridogenetic and the popula-
tions consist of diploid and triploid individuals I used
haplotypes (based on microsatellites) in order to look
at the structuring, by performing an AMOVA and cal-
culating Fst values. I then used PHYLIP to draw such
a tree based on these Fst values, but I have not ﬁgured
out yet how to bootstrap in order to look how good
this tree is. In PHYLIP (SEQBOOT) one can only in-
ﬁle data with gene frequencies, molecular sequences or
restriction sites and NOT data with genetic distances
(?).
Does anyone know if it is possible to draw unrooted
neigbour-joining trees based on microsatellite haplo-
type data and also be able to then bootstrap ?
Thanks in advance for any help.

Codivergence analyses
Dear Evoldir members,
does anyone know a means of testing for parallelism be-
tween two parasite phylogenies (within the same genus)
using a method that does not rely on a host-parasite
framework e.g. TREEMAP and TREEFITTER? Pairs
of parasite races, one race from each phylogeny, share
the same host plant species. There are 12 such pairings
and all on diﬀerent host species. We are not looking to
model switching events, etc, but attemting to evaluate
whether isolating episodes of host plants are reﬂected
in both the parasite trees.
Have a goodie, Mike.

ANNOUNCEMENT: ConGen Call for Applications -
Final Reminder
Dear Evoldir Members,
The European Science Foundation Programme on In-
tegrating population genetics and conservation biol-
ogy: merging theoretical, experimental and applied ap-
proaches (ConGen) is oﬀering funding for a number of
Short Visits (up to 15 days) and Exchange Grants (from
15 days to 6 months) related to the scientiﬁc objec-
tives of the Programme Please note that the Steering
Committee will fund only suﬃcient high-quality appli-
cations. Junior applicants with little experience in writ-
ing a proposal are therefore strongly recommended to
ask advice from their senior local and/or host supervi-
sor on these matters.
The next deadline for applications is 15 NovemberDecember 1, 2005 EvolDir 55
2005. To apply please visit http://www.esf.org/-
esfarticle.php?language=0&domain=3&activity=-
1&article=443&page=1157
ConGen invites proposals from potential organisers of
WORKSHOPS to be held in 2006 on topics with a clear
connection to the Programme.
The Steering Committee welcomes all proposals that
fall within the scope of ConGen but is particularly in-
terested in receiving proposals targeted at the following
issues:
1. Use and abuse of molecular genetic markers in con-
servation genetics:
Including questions as: How these markers can be used
to infer population structure, gene ﬂow and demo-
graphic parameters? Can the diﬀerent processes that
lead to similar patterns of genetic structure be distin-
guished? Can they be used to signify causal processes
as habitat change, fragmentation or disturbance? Use
and limitations of (existing) software packages.
2. Level of Genetic variation and the short- and long-
term fate of populations: Causal relationship with ﬁt-
ness, adaptive potential and survival:
Discussing issues as: (i) relevance of neutral genetic
markers versus selective variation; (ii) quantitative vari-
ation versus major genes; (iii) local adaptation versus
plasticity; (iv) local adaptation and gene ﬂow; (v) is
the level of genetic variation a limiting factor?
3. Scaling issues in conservation genetics:
Raising questions as: To what extent can genetic mea-
sures that normally are used to study gene diversity, de-
mography and dispersal at the population and species
level be up scaled to higher levels of biological organi-
sation? Can genetic measures be developed to investi-
gate diversity and its dynamics at the community level?
How is the distribution of biodiversity (across Europe)
aﬀected by diﬀerent spatio-temporal scales and are
standard population genetic processes and approaches
adequate to illuminate this?
Priority will be given to workshops taking place in coun-
tries that ﬁnancially support the Programme (Austria,
Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and
Turkey).
ConGen will provide a maximum of 20 000 EUR per
workshop.

DNA from feces
Dear all, we will soon start a sampling of feces for dna
extraction. I ’ve seen that there is a variety of methods
available. However, since I have no experience with
extracting dna from feces, I need someone’s help to
choose the most eﬀective method. Basically, some pro-
cedures recommend to scrape the outermost layer from
the scat and deep freeze it (or use ethanol). Others,
are based on the use of silica with the purpose of dehy-
drating the sample. In this second case the extraction
would be done later (even after months!, by using an
aliquot of the scat [see “Quantitative polymerase chain56 EvolDir December 1, 2005

DNA sequencing survey
*Calling all operators of AUTOMATED DNA se-
quencers!*
The DNA Sequencing Research Group (DSRG) of
the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities
(ABRF) invites all laboratories involved in DNA se-
quencing applications to participate in an on-line sur-
vey.
The goal of this survey is to capture the current
proﬁle of DNA sequencing facilities in both the aca-
demic and commercial sectors, from individual research
labs to structured core facilities and genome centers.
Through comparison to previous studies, the impact
of current instrumentation on sample throughput, data
turnaround time, staﬃng and pricing will be assessed.
We anticipate that these results will serve as a bench-
mark against which institutions can compare their re-
spective core facilities.
The survey is available until December 31st , 2005 at
http://www.cores.utah.edu/surveyor/index.php?sid=1
Preliminary results will be presented at the annual
ABRF meeting in Long Beach, CA, in February, 2006.
The complete study will be published in the Journal of
Biomolecular Techniques (JBT) later in the year.
Thank you for your support and participation.

EtBr dangers
Dear All, Does anyone of you know “serious” publica-
tions about how hazardous is EtBr to humans (as whole
entities, not as single cells)? I know people who do not
care for EtBr at all. I’ve heard also that ethidium bro-
mide is or was used as trypanosomid in African cat-
tle. On the other hand, chlorophorm can burn your
eyes, acrylamide can aﬀect your neural system, and
guanidine thiocyanate can even kill you dead. In thislight, calling EtBr “one of the most hazardous stan-
dard reagents” is in my opinion an overstatement. Of
course, one have to be careful but it’s nothing unusual
in the lab. I do not claim ethidium bromide is safe,
I just wonder how careful I should be. It’s better to
know the truth before you start pumping public money
to private companies. How about bird ﬂu in the lab?
;-) Best regards, Maciek

EtBr dangers answers
Dear Scientists, Some two weeks ago I have posted a
question about “serious” publications about how haz-
ardous Ethidium Bromide can be to humans. I did not
get much response. I have even started to worry that
this “summary” may provoke another discussion about
belief and science ;-) Other DNA staining reagents
might also cause cancer, but as they are new it is pos-
sible that they were not thoroghly tested. Some people
suppose that detoxication methods may be more harm-
ful to humans and the environment than EtBr itself.
Thus my advice is:
BE CAREFUL but DON’T PANIC
...and “just in case” and/or for the sake of religious tol-
erance one should not expose other beings to EtBr. It’s
not worth dying in the lab but I’m not going to give up
good old EtBr. The most comprehensive reply you will
ﬁnd below. Best wishes Maciek Konopinski
—— I’m too idle and pre-occupied to go looking for the
papers I collected some yrs ago when I was divisional
safety oﬃcer, but there is a literature, albeit a bit am-
biguous, and a suitable database search ought to ﬁnd
it. My assessment of it was:
(a) that evidence for the mutagenicity/carcinogenicity
of EtBr in its native state was not totally clear, in part
because it is said that this class of chemical does not
penetrate nuclear membranes. On the other and it can
be used to stain chromosomes/DNA in whole mounts
of cells, so his may not be true, and it ismutagenic in
the Ames test with the addition of microsomal extract,
i.e. when activated.
(b) there is good evidence that some hypochlorite
degradation products of EtBr are highly mutagenic
(Ames) without activation.
(c) on general principles, intercalating agents ought to58 EvolDir December 1, 2005
be mutagenic/carcinogenic if they gain access to DNA.
(d) I believe that the international agency that tests
potentical carcinogens (IARC) has reported it as being
hazardous.
Therefore laboratory work should assume the worst and
take all appropriate precautions.
Furthermore, labs include people who have not made
the explicit Mephistophelian bargain that it involves -
to run some personal risk for the sake of the results.
Cleaners, for example. Therefore the only responsi-
ble procedure is to treat it as a dangerous carcino-
gen/mutagen and minimise local environmental con-
tamination. For that reason we enforce post-staining
with dilute EtBr and water-washing before taking a gel
to a transilluminator - to avoid the hazard of breath-
able particles of dried buﬀer salts/EtBr being mobilised
and inhaled by cleaners (or ourselves). Such particles
would (in theory) be particularly dangerous.
Because EtBr also binds to proteins, I am personally
(and when I was safety oﬃcer, institutionally) relaxed
about allowing very dilute solutions to be disposed of
into the public drainage system. There it will be further
diluted and will always be mixed with/bound to an ex-
cess of protein and bacteria. This is another theoretical
argument, not based on direct evidence.
I hope that this is both helpful and correct.

Dear colleagues
The conventional methods for estimating nonsynony-
mous substitutions (Ka or dN) do not distinguish be-
tween diﬀerent kinds of amino acid changes. We are
publishing a method in MBE (A new method for esti-
mating nonsynonymous substitutions and its applica-
tions to detecting positive selection) that permits such
a distinction. On average, Kh (substitutions of high-
exchangeability amino acids) is about twice the con-
ventional estimate of Ka but of course ﬂuctuates from
gene to gene.

Lev Yampolsky ——————————- Dear Noreen,
I read your note
on the EvolDir website this morning and was interested
to read that you are searching for online human genetic
diversity databases. So are we! We have found a couple
which may be of interest.
1) First is the CEPH genotype database at
www.cephb.fr/cephdb/ This contains the the 5000+
microsatellites used by Dib et al to build a linkage map
of the human genome (Nature: reference on the web-
site). They were all run on 3 generations of 8 families
(grandparents, parents and children. And when I say
children, I mean lots: most have around 15! Some mi-
crosat loci have been run on other families as well. You
can look at individual families on the net or download
all of them (we wrote our own program to do this). Note
that we discovered some of the genotyping by some
researchers does not match that by others. Also the
stated heterozygosities on the website use a completely
diﬀerent calculation (with diﬀerent results) to that in
the original publication, although they don’t mention
it. We have spent some time working out what is going
on with this database and I would be happy to pass on
some of our acquired wisdom. For example, some of the
grandparents are related to grandparents in other fam-
ilies. There is also a list of which familiy comes from
where (Utah, France, Venezuela for the main 8-family
database). This database now includes thousands of
SNP loci as well, although we have not used it. The
index page at www.cephb.fr has links and information
on this and more.
2) We recently found the Marshﬁeld dataset: 1000+
individuals from all over the world, run on 400+ mi-
crosatellites at 10cM intervals across the genome. The
genotypes can be dowloaded as an Excel ﬁle (huge!).
This is all at http://research.marshﬁeldclinic.org/-
genetics/Freq/FreqInfo.htm together with background
and references. We have stopped using this as each
population often had only 50 or 60 individuals and for
some reason old world countries only had one or two
females genotyped, compared with 20 or 30 males, the
new world countries and Europe had almost the reverse.
The original authors used the data to group humans
into 5 main regions.
I’d be very interested to hear what it is you are look-
ing at (also if you have since come across any other
databases). We are currently in the midst of analysis,
but are looking at issues surrounding heterozygosity, its

Individual Primer Number answers
Dear all, Here are the answers to my “Individual Primer
Numbers” question. Many thanks to some colleagues
who just kindly answered me.
Please see below the question and replies. momonga.
—————— Q. Dear all,
I plan to look at population genetic structure of a mam-
mal species with microsats. About 30 populations will
be selected from the whole range (North America) of
the species. Many suggest about 20 individuals per
population and 15-20 markers (primer sets) would be
appropriate for the study. However, I wonder how to
decide these numbers (individual#-primer# combina-
tion). Could you give any answer or reference for this
?
———— 1. It depends upon the question you are try-
ing to ask and the speciﬁcity of your markers. The
sweet spot for maximum utility for all possible ques-
tion, 6 loci with 6 makers total are about right. Unless
you are doing spatial autocorrelation or paternity, it is
my opinion that 15-20 markers is simply going to waste
your money. If you cannot ﬁgure out what is going on
with about half that, your trying to pick up very vague
data. One way to tell is to look at the variance of your
estimators. Once the variance of your parameters set-
tle down, you have the right number of inds/markers
per stratum. There is an example of this at: Dyer,
R.J. & V.L. Sork. 2001. Pollen Pool Heterogeneity in
Shortleaf Pine, Pinus echinata Mill. Molecular Ecology
10: 859-866. You can grab a pdf from my server if you
like. – Rodney J. Dyer, PhD Department of Biology
Center for the Study of Biological Complexity Virginia
Commonwealth University ————- 2. It depends ex-
actly what your questions are. For general population
genetics, the numbers of samples and loci you sug-
gest sound ﬁne (and I would not get too bogged down
worrying about exactly the balance between samples
and loci), but for most population biology applications
you would be well advised to use some markers that
can be sequenced (most obviously a mtDNA marker,
screened by sequencing all individuals, or SSCP+some
sequencing, or equivalent depending on what is con-venient and cost eﬀective for you). There are some
investigations for sensitivity for speciﬁc applications,

MegaFluor EthBr alternative
Dear collegues,
one of the most hazardous standard reagents in molec-
ular labs is ethidium bromide used to detect nucleic
acids. Some alternative ﬂuorescent dyes (like Sybr
Green) are reportedly less mutagenic but still consti-
tute health hazards.
Lately I found out that there might be a safe al-
ternative to ethidium bromide. The dye is called
“MegaFluor”, produced by EuroClone ( http:/-
/www.euroclone.net/ ) and distributed e.g. by
Gentaur ( http://www.gentaur.com/acatalog/-
GENTAUR Reagents 3212.html ). According to
the manufacturer this dye is non-toxic because
it is too big to pass through cellular membranes
(http://www.euroclone.net/prodotti/pdf/datasheets/-
EMR051500.pdf ) and it is therefore recommended by
the Health and Safety Department of the University
of Edinburgh ( http://www.safety.ed.ac.uk/resources/-
General/EthBrAlt.shtm ).
However, since the product is not cheap, and I don’t
know anybody who has used this product successfully,
I would like to ask if somebody has any experience with
it. Principally I would prefer using a non-toxic alterna-
tive to stain DNA, especially for student courses, even
if it is more expensive.
I guess the answers to this question will be of interest to
many other people working in molecular labs. There-
fore I will post a summary of the results (if any).
Best wishes,
Martin

Microsat Double Peaks answers
Microsatellite Double peaks
Dear Evoldir members Many thanks for all your com-
ments on (trouble)shooting the double peaks dur-
ing fragment analysis using trinucleotide microsatellite
markers. It was great to receive so many suggestions by
evoldir members from all over the globe. Many thanks
for this! I compiled a brief summary of the main sug-
gestions. I hope that it will be of help for others who
are facing similar problems.
Best wishes Velavan velavanp@yahoo.com
Suggestions as provided by Evoldir members are listedbelow.
The presence of double peaks are most likely due to
incomplete adenylation of my fragments by Taq poly-
merase, producing A overhangs and resulting in two
peaks for each allele, which then diﬀer by a single base.
You can solve this by either taking away the A from all
the peaks or forcing everything to be plus-A, which is
the easiest.
The most prominent way to get over this is by Pig-
tailing your unlabelled primer at the 5 end (Brown-
stein et.al 1996 BioTechniques; Magnuson et.al 1996
BioTechniques). This should lead to complete adenyla-
tion of all fragments.
Other suggestion that could be tried out are
1. Add a 45 minute to 1 hour step at 60 degrees (al-
ternatively 72oC) immediately after the last cycle (So
no ﬁnal extension at 72 degrees). This step provides no
free nucleotides left. All amplicons will have an A over-
hang (plus-A). 2. Use less template DNA. 3. Tryout
Touch down PCR 4. Try Diﬀerent MgCl2 Concentra-
tions ranging from 1mM to 6mM. 5. After PCR com-
pletion, leave your PCR products at room temperature
O/N or Deep freeze it. 6. Use Mungbean nuclease to
get A molecules by polishing the product 7. Usage of
Pfu polymerase enzyme or a combination of Pfu and
the normal Taq (As Pfus are expensive) to get rid of
A overhangs during ampliﬁcation (thanks to the proof-
reading activity of Pfu) 8. Use Invitrogens Tsp DNA
polymerase or GENOTYPE Tsp DNA polymerase by
Life technologies (which lacks terminal transferase ac-
tivity) 9. Perhaps you can also dilute your PCR prod-
uct before loading it to the capillaries. 10. Add 0.4U
T4 polymerase to 10ul of your PCR product, incubate
at 37oC for 30 min, in order to obtain equally sized
fragments.

Microsat double peaks
Dear Evoldir Members,December 1, 2005 EvolDir 63
I am expereincing a problem during fragment analysis
of trinucleotide microsatellite markers for earthworms
(Lumbricus terrestris). The problem is that I get dou-
ble peaks for the expected fragment size. The diﬀerence
between the two peaks is ca. 1 basepair and thus clearly
less than the repeat unit. I tried out diﬀerent strate-
gies to get rid of the double peaks, including: i) HPLC
puriﬁed primers to ascertain that the two primers used
per locus really have the right size. ii) diﬀerent MgCl2
concentrations (2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 mM) iii) variation
of extension time (no extension at all (direct step from
annealing to denaturation); 1 min; 2min, 2:30min) iv)
variation of the ﬁnal extension time (no ﬁnal extension
step; 5 min; 20 min; 30 min) v) diﬀerent annealing
temperatures (50, 52, 55, 57, 60, 65 oC) vi) variation
of cycle number (25, 30, 35) vii) hotstart Taq (Ampli-
Taq Gold), normal Taq (invitrogen, bioline) All PCR
reactions were done in Eppendorf thermocyclers. The
general cycling conditions are: 5’ 94oC, then 35x: 1’
94oC, 1’ 60oC, 1’ 72oC, followed by a ﬁnal extension
of 5’ 72oC. For exceptions see above. PCR products
were not speciﬁcally puriﬁed. Fragments were sepa-
rated on an ABI 3130XL with ﬂuorescently labelled
primers and standard running conditions (dilution in
HiDi formamide; prior denaturation of PCR products,
etc).
At the moment, we are running out of ideas what to
change. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you could
send me further suggestions, which may help to get rid
of these double peaks..
cheers

MolEcol Book
Dear all,
Some of you might be interesting to know that my new
Molecular Ecology book will be available starting nextweek, published by Wiley & Sons. This is a comprehen-
sive text with chapters on markers, population genetics,
phylogeography, behavioural ecology, conservation ge-
netics, and some of the more general applications of
molecular ecology (e.g. relevance to law enforcement,
agriculture, and so on). There’s lots of info in there -
over 700 references - and it is generally aimed at upper
level undergraduates, grad students, and researchers. If
you would like any more info on this you can get it from
Amazon or from the Wiley website (I won’t give a url
because in both cases it will depend on which country
you’re in).

MultiLocus Frequencies answers
Thanks to everyone who responded to my email.
It seems I should have mentioned that I work with cycli-
cal parthenogens and thus was literally wanting counts
of the number of individuals that share the same multi-
locus genotype (clonal diversity) in each sample. That
appears to have caused some confusion, so sorry about
that!

gram that will calculate exactly that: (Thank-you

and Arlequin also calculate related statistics.
—————- 3) For those interested in going deeper:
Are you assuming linkage equilibrium? If so, the prob-
lem should be simple. But if you assume LD, then64 EvolDir December 1, 2005
you have to make some simplifying assumptions - for
example, that LD is due to population mixing. Oth-
erwise, there are far too many genotype frequencies to
estimate.
I have a paper on this issue (Heredity 2000), and it is
closely related to programs such as Structure (Pritchard
et al) that ﬁt models of admizture. There are Math-
ematica programs that do the estimation at http://-
helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/evolgen under Multilocus. (After
loading, look in the Help Browser under “Estimating
disequilibrium”). But, they don’t cope with multiple
alleles & so wouldn’t be much help for microsatellites

Network Diagrams
Dear EvolDir members,
I need to create a publication quality ﬁgure from a net-
work calculated in Network software (Fluxus). The
software allows me to export images only as bitmap
(bmp) or pdf. Both are of poor quality. I would very
much appreciate any suggestions for a software that
could handle formatted network diagrams (fdi ﬁles) and
the output would be a high quality image. What other
alternatives are there?

PCR sex test
Hi
I am interested in hearing from anyone using PCR-
based molecular tests of sex on any taxa who has found
errors in the process. An error could be a sample that
is designated one sex in a PCR ampliﬁcation and the
other sex in a subsequent ampliﬁcation with the same
PCR primer set (i.e. a repeated test) or a diﬀerent PCR
test of molecular sex.
I have found a number of instances of both types of
error in the literature on birds, ﬁsh and apes but sus-
pect that many labs would have encountered errors in
PCR-based sexing that are never published.

PCRmachines MJR
Some news and a question about PCR machines for the
group....
Like many labs, we use MJR thermal cyclers for PCR
and have been quite happy with them. Our Dyad ma-
chine has gone on the fritz and needs repair. When I
called Bio-rad, which acquired MJR earlier this year,
they told me that they cannot service any MJR ma-
chine because of a court order permanently enjoin-
ing them from selling or supporting MJR machines in
the U.S. The order is due to successful legal action
by ABI/Applera against MJR for patent infringement.
Bio-rad1s materials state that they have tried to ne-
gotiate a settlement with ABI, but ABI has shown no
interest in reaching an agreement. Bio-rad says they
are continuing their eﬀorts, but there is no timetable
for when service might resume on MJR cyclers in the
U.S. (see www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/letter.pdf )
This puts us and probably a growing number of U.S.
labs as time passes in a diﬃcult position, with an ex-
pensive and eﬀectively worthless machine in our hands.
Bio-rad is honoring warrantees and service contracts
on MJR instruments by providing loaners of their own
3Icycler2PCR machines until the warrantee/contract
runs out. They will also provide a3generous2trade-in
on MJR machines requiring repair for those wanting to
buy a new Icycler machine.
Does anyone have experience with the Icycler? I would
appreciate hearing any testimonials about its perfor-
mance and reliability.

PortugeuesePubl other answers
Hello to everyone on this sunny thursday afternoon,
I apologise for posting this resume-e-mail perhapsDecember 1, 2005 EvolDir 67
somewhat late, but I would like to sum up the answers I
got to all my enquiries, in order to express my gratitude
and appreciation to all engaged Evoldir-members.
1.) As far back as June 2004 ( if I remember the date
correctly), I posted an enquiry about inferences on so-
cial behaviour of human ancestors such as Australop-
ithecus.
I received three or four mails or so. All of these mails
alluded to the work by J. Michael Plavcan of the De-
partment of Anatomy, New York College of Osteopathic
Medicine.
There is, f.i., the following reference:
Plavcan, J.M. 2000. Inferring Social behavior from sex-
ual dimorphism in the fossil record. Journal of Human
evolution 39, 327-344.
2.) A few months ago I posted another enquiry about
the variation, behaviour, and evolution of guppies (Poe-
cilia reticulata), a small, Neotropical ﬁsh species, which
is a livebearer (Poecilidae).
As feed-back to this enquiry, I received e-mails by Anne
Magurran, Anna Lindholm, Kit Magellan, and Erika
Crispo. These mails contained many hints, suggestions,
and some papers which deal mainly with the popula-
tion genetics of Poecilia reticulata, this so common ﬁsh
species in some Tropical urban ecoystems.
3.) As to my enquiry which I posted only recently (was:
scientiﬁc publications published in Portuguese), I re-
ceived only very few feed-back so far.
Rogerio O. Souza from Santa Catarina state, Brazil,
indicated the following Brazilian journals: Revista
Brasileira de Biologia, and Revista Brasileira de Zo-
ologia.
All of these journals and many more (at least the newer
volumes) can be seen online at the excellent Brazilian
open-access-source www.scielo.br . And many articles
therein published are indeed in Portuguese. But I did
not get so far publications from other Lusophone coun-
tries, such as Portugal, Moambique etc..
I thank to all of you. The topic one has died for me,
as the student switched to another monography topic.
The topic two is still somewhat of interest. But I am
now very generally minded, and I am having an eye on
study topics in general, in all small livebearer species
(not necessarily Poecilia reticulata). The topic three
also continues to be of interest.
best wishes, com meus melhores cumprimentos,
good work! Bom trabalho!

Portuguese papers
Hello, I have seen that there are many Lusophone
Evoldir participants.
For my “Bioestatistica”-lessons to undergraduates
(who do not read English), I would need about 15 to 20
diﬀerent archives of published scientiﬁc papers in Por-
tuguese (about evolutionary biology, senso latu, includ-
ing ecology, biodiversity, etc.). These papers should
contain a methodological section which explains well
all statistical methods used.
ANOVA, linear regression and non-parametric meth-
ods.
Feel free to send such archives, if you have them! En-
glish texts do not help at all.

Software Clann 3 0 1
Hi,
Just a quick note to let you know that Clann 3.0.1 is
now available for download at http://bioinf.nuim.ie/-
software/clann This is a minor update which addresses
the following issues:
- A modiﬁcation of the seed choice for the random num-
ber generator was made to make sure that if severalClanns are started up at exactly the same time, they
will all have diﬀerent seeds.
- Fixed a bug in the robinson foulds distances. This
over estimated the distances if the input trees given
were rooted. The bug has been ﬁxed.
- Clann was reported to crash with some large datasets,
this has been recti ﬁed.
- A problem reading nexus ﬁles has been ﬁxed.
- Some problems with aspects of the “include” and ex-
clude“ commands have been ﬁxed.
- Some minor cosmetic changes were made to the inter-
face.

Software TreeMaker
Phylogenies combined with distribution data provide a
logical framework for assessing the conservation worth
and biodiversity. TreeMaker is a multiplatform pro-
gram (Mac, PC, Linux) for the building and editing of
phylogenies based on systematic nomenclature, either
de novo or imported from existing data. Survey data
on the incidence or abundance of taxa at discrete sites
can be entered. The resulting data can be exported
in a variety of formats, including NEXUS, for use in
other programs. Together with the previously-existing
program MeSA, various measures assessing biodiversity
under phylogenetic criteria can be derived for combina-
tions of sites.
The programs are available at:

ing for a population genetics software program that will
enable me to take two or more populations with partic-
ular genotypes (preferably allocated by me), allow them
to interbreed (preferably over several generations), andthen give me an output ﬁle with the genotypes of the
progeny. If anybody knows of such a software program,
please contact me via email.

Spider DNA extraction
Dear Evoldir members
We are experiencing a repeated problem with DNA
extraction from fairly large 12-15 mm) spiders col-
lected in the ﬁeld and stored in 95% ethanol for up
to one month before freezing. In some cases neither
phenol/chloroform extraction or Qiagen extraction kits
yields any DNA. Ethanol is exchanged on the second
day following conservation. I would be grateful for ad-
vice on extraction as well as on optimal storage of ﬁeld
specimens.
Thanks a lot,

TCS problem solved
Dear Evoldir list members, I would like to wholeheart-
edly thank you for the beautiful community that you
are forming and keeping alive. I received dozens of
helpful comments on my diﬃculties using TCS. I am
very grateful to all. In brief, it would appear that it
is MUCH better to use an input ﬁle in the nexus for-
mat, rather than phylip. Since there are so many soft-
wares available these days which convert phylip ﬁles
into nexus ones (PAUP, proseq, DNAsp, MEGA, etc...)
I guess it’s simply easier to convert and use nexus.
Thank you also to David Posada for his availability.
good luck to all,

TCS problems
Dear all, I am trying to use TCS (Clement et al) to con-
struct a parsimony haplotype network from a series of
sequences. My input ﬁle is a normal, perfect “phylip”
type, and I did get rid of any “space”, “tab” or “re-
turns”. And TCS does open it. This notwithstanding,
when I try to run the computation, a window pops out
and tells me: “You have too many returns in the ﬁrst
individual”. It stops and I have to shut down. Has
anyone encountered this problem before? Does any-
body have any suggestion as to how to get around it?
(this even including sadly using another software!).
Thanks a million,
Stefano.

TE-AFLP software
Colleagues:
I am looking for a TE-AFLP analysis program which
allows me to search for phenotypes. I have 299 sam-
ples divided over 34 populations and 5 regions. The
program RAPDist version 1.4 limits 100 samples and
version 2.0 limits 250 samples but almost all functions
are not currently implented in version 2.0. Does anyone
know a program which counts how many diﬀerent phe-
notypes there are, and how many individuals of each
phenotype are in the samples?December 1, 2005 EvolDir 71

Transilluminators answers
Hi All
Below is my original email, followed by the responces,
thankyou all again for your advice.
Transilluminators We are looking at purchasing a tran-
silluminator - for quite basic use reading bands and tak-
ing photos - no cutting/cloning etc. We will be using
it in a dark room. Currently we use a UV transillumi-
nator and Ethidium Bromide staining and it has been
suggested that we might consider switching to one of
the Dark Reader transilluminators (e.g. Clare Chemi-
cal Research DR88M Transilluminator to avoid the UV
light etc. I would be grateful to hear from people who
have experience with this type of transilluminator. Is
the resulting visualisation comparable with that of UV
transilluminators - I understand it may not be as useful
with Ethidium Bromide...
Digital Cameras We are also looking at the possibility
of obtaining a good commercial digital camera (aimed
at public rather than lab work) to use with this set up
(as opposed to a gel documentation system) and would
be grateful for any advice from people operation this
type of system.

Hi,
we are using a normal UV-table. On top we place a
box with a hole in it, through which we take a pic-
ture with the digital camera. It works and the qual-
ity of the pictures is good. If you want to make your
own documentation system, you need to have a camera
which allows manual adjustments. We use an old Nikon
Coolpix 990, which does the job. Moreover, you can tilt
the screen which allows you to observe more easily what
is going one while you take the picture from above. We
got some ideas from here: http://www.virginia.edu/-

Tiawanna,
My lab has been using precisely the sort of set-up that
you describe for several years and we’re quite happy
with it. We have a Clare Dark Reader transillumina-
tor and a consumer-grade digital camera (Canon G1)
on an old Polaroid camera stand, connected to a sal-
vaged video monitor. Ordinarily, we use the orange ﬁl-
ter/viewscreen that came with the Dark Reader, with
no additional ﬁlter on the camera (but see below). The
camera is set up in a small darkroom (really little more
than a closet); we process the images on a computer
that sits outside the darkroom. Because we salvaged
the monitor and copy stand, total cost was about 20%
of a comparable commercial gel-documentation system.
I am very pleased with the results. Especially with the
addition of the video monitor (for bigger views/better
focusing than is possible on the camera’s viewscreen),
we get great visualization of our gels, and with the ﬂexi-
bility of this camera, we have considerable control over
the photographic conditions. By adding some simple
lighting, we also have a good SDS-PAGE documenta-
tion system, and for those situations where we need it,
we can substitute a UV transilluminator for the blue-
light box (this does require an orange ﬁlter on the cam-
era, purchased from the local camera store). Finally,
by using a consumer digital camera, we have the added
ﬂexibility of detaching the camera for other lab docu-
mentation needs.
I should add that we have switched almost entirely
away from Ethidium bromide, using Molecular Probes’
SYBR Green for routine gel staining in order to de-
crease the health risks associated with Ethidium (es-
pecially because all the students in my lab are un-
dergraduates with minimal prior training). I haven’t
done a cost analysis myself, though I have seen reports72 EvolDir December 1, 2005
that used carefully, SYBR Green can be cheaper than
Ethidium. We use a gel-loading buﬀer that contains
the SYBR Green, so gels can be examined mid-run and
there is no need for post-run staining or destaining.
Staining appears uniform and capable of detecting a
few nanograms of DNA. With this usage pattern, our
current stock of SYBR Green is apt to last for years
and years.
If you’d like to know more about our setup, please don’t
hesitate to let me know.
With best wishes,
Peter Kuhlman

iSpecies website
For fun I’ve created a site that searches three data
sources - NCBI, Yahoo images, and Google Scholar for
information on a taxonomic name. If you type in a
name you get information on whether that organism
has been sequenced (and if so, how many sequences
are available), the ﬁrst ﬁve images Yahoo ﬁnds on the
web, and up to 10 documents from Google Scholar (withDOIs and links to PubMed, where available ).
If you’d like to try it go to http://ispecies.org (you’ll
get forwarded to a machine here in Glasgow).
I know there are all sorts of problems with searching on
names, but I’ve found it to be fun to see just how much
information is out there.
Example links to try are:

INRA Nice HostParasitoid
A Postdoctoral/Research Associate Position in “Evolu-
tionary Biology and Physiology of Host-Parasitoid in-
teractions”, starting beginning 2006, is available at the
INRA-University Nice Sophia-Antipolis, France.
The candidate will join a young research team work-
ing on “Evolutionary Genetics of Host-Parasite Inter-
actions” in the ROSE (Organism Responses to Envi-
ronmental Stress) Lab, a INRA-University laboratory,
20km west of Nice in the south part of France. The
position is funded by the National Research Agency for
two years and the salary is about 1900 euros ( ~2200 US
$) per month, plus health insurance.
The project is aimed to characterize virulence factors
of Hymenopteran parasitoids and analyse their bio-
logical eﬀects in suppressing the immune defences of
their insect hosts. A comparative approach is devel-
opped in order to understand evolution of virulence in
hymenopteran parasitoids and decipher the molecular
bases of host speciﬁcity.
The biological model involves Drosophila hosts and Fig-
itid parasitoids (Leptopilina genus) in which intra spe-
ciﬁc variability for virulence and resistance has been
described. The project is designed to characterize new
virulence factors in two diﬀerent types of L. boulardi
females diﬀering by their host speciﬁcity level and ana-
lyze their physiological eﬀects and their molecular tar-
gets in Drosophila hosts. This model oﬀers a unique
opportunity to address the origin and nature of intra-
speciﬁc diﬀerences in virulence mechanisms that allow
adaptation to diﬀerent host species.
We are seeking a motivated postdoctoral fellow with
an interest in physiological and molecular aspects as
well as evolutionary aspects of parasitic or symbiotic
interactions. A good experience in molecular biology
is needed. Practical knowledge in the Drosophila ﬁeld
will be appreciated as well as training in evolutionary
concepts. However, candidates with less optimal pro-
ﬁles will be considered provided their motivation, work
power and skills allow them to adapt rapidly to the
project.
Interested candidates should send a curriculum vitæ, aDecember 1, 2005 EvolDir 77

POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN EVOLUTION-
ARY GENETICS / GENOMICS
Postdoctoral positions are available in the laboratory
of Michael Lynch, Department of Biology, Indiana Uni-
versity, Bloomington, Indiana:
Molecular evolutionary consequences of recombination
and asexuality in Daphnia. This project takes advan-
tage of the burgeoning set of genomic tools available for
Daphnia pulex (including a complete-genome sequence,
high density genetic map, microarrays, etc.), as well as
the widespread distribution of asexual and sexual lin-
eages in the study species. Numerous subprojects re-
lated to this system are available, as part of a larger
NSF FIBR grant on the role of recombination in evo-
lution. Among other things, this work is intended to
establish Daphnia as a major model organism for eco-
logical / evolutionary genomics. Candidates must have
strong molecular skills, and background and/or interest
in population genetics.
Comparative genome evolution in Paramecium. We are
initiating studies on the genome architecture of vari-
ous members of the ciliate genus Paramecium. Speciﬁc
interests include the evolution of introns and internal
eliminated sequences, and levels of standing nucleotide
variation within and among species.
Evolution of spliceosomal introns and eukaryotic gene
processing mechanisms. The goals here are to shed light
on a number of unanswered questions regarding eukary-
otic genes, including those concerned with the origin
and proliferation of introns, the evolution of untrans-
lated regions (UTRs) of genes, and nonsense-mediated
decay and other aspects of mRNA processing. Candi-
dates must have strong skills in the area of bioinfor-
matics / computational biology and a good workingknowledge of molecular genetics.
Characterization of the spontaneous mutation proper-
ties in eukaryotes. Taking advantage of several sets
of long-term mutation accumulation lines of several
species (including the nematode C. elegans, the mi-
crocrustacean Daphnia pulex, the ciliate Paramecium
tetraurelia, the bdelloid rotifer Philodina roseola, and
the yeast S. cerevisiae), we are attempting to quan-
tify the entire mutational spectrum at the molecular
level using high-throughput techniques, with a long-
term goal of establishing generalities across eukaryotes.
Candidates must have strong molecular skills.
All openings are immediately available and will remain
open until suitable candidates are located. For imme-
diate consideration, please send email applications (in-
cluding a cover letter outlining your interests, complete

“Quantitative- and molecular genetic characterization
and evaluation of animal genetic resources”
Two year post doc position at the Institute of Animal
Breeding, Department of Animal Breeding and Genetic
Resources
Genetic diversity in farm animal species is the basic re-
quirement in animal breeding to meet future breeding
goals, but has been lost in the past at an increasing rate.
Improvement of our insight into mechanisms underly-
ing genetic diversity will assist in the reconstruction
of domestication events, determination of genetic re-
lationships between populations, assessment of genetic
variation within populations, development of a strat-
egy to manage and conserve genetic diversity, and may
indicate possible consequences of intensive selection in
a decreasing number of populations and lines used in
farm animal species. The research is aimed at the de-
velopment and implementation of sophisticated quan-
tative genetic methods using molecular information inthis ﬁeld. In our on-going collaborative research activ-
ities we have assessed a wide ranged gene pool in the
chicken by typing more than 70 breeds at microsatel-
lite locii from all over the world. In addition, molec-
ular polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA as well as
in candiate genes are currently under study. This col-
lection in chickens provides an excellent model for the
validation of molecular tools as an essential source of
information to assess genetic diversity in farm animal
species. The successful applicant is expected to join
this international collaboration and will be involved in
the analysis of the genetic structure of a given gene
pool, assignment of individuals into classes or clusters,
detection of selection eﬀects by comparing highly se-
lected populations and unselected ones, and possible
introgression of genome fractions from various sources
into modern breeding populations. To meet the re-
quirements of potential users, algorithms and methods
established during the project lifetime will be imple-
mented into databases which are under development at
the institute. The project will run over a period of 24
months.
Deadline for submission of application is Dec. 6, 2005.
The position is available as of January 1st 2006, but
later stating dates are negotiable.

Postdoc: Evolutionary biology of mutation and recom-
bination University of Toronto
I am seeking a postdoc who is interested in working
on projects related to the evolutionary biology of mu-
tation and recombination. Current work in the lab fo-
cuses on variation in these traits within species. In
particular, I am interested in understanding the extent
to which these traits are condition dependent. Candi-
dates interested in working on my existing projects or
on other projects related to mutation and/or recombi-
nation are encouraged to apply. The position is for one
year though a second year may be possible.
The successful applicant will become a member of a
large and interactive community of evolutionary bi-
ologists at the University of Toronto. The growing
strength in evolutionary biology in both the Zoology
and Botany departments has led to the forthcoming
formation of a Department of Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology. The city of Toronto is fantastically diverse
and an excellent place to live.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biol-
ogy with a strong background in evolutionary genetics.
Experience with basic molecular techniques and statis-
tics is also an asset. Interested persons should send
the following information: CV, statement of research
interests, and names and contact information for three
references. Applications send by email should be in
.pdf format. Informal inquires are welcome. Start date

CIˆENCIA, OEIRAS, PORTUGAL FIRST CALL FOR
PARTICIPANTS (DEADLINE 15 JANUARY 2006)
We are happy to announce the ﬁrst international
workshop dedicated to the study of evolution with
Caenorhabditis species. The workshop will be held for
three days from 24 to 26 of May 2006, at the Instituto
Gulbenkian de Ciencia in Oeiras, 20km from Lisbon, in
Portugal. Reception will take place on the 23 ^rd .
The program will encompass several sessions on diverse
topics such as: - breeding system evolution and male
function; - genotypic distributions during inbreeding
and adaptation to novel environments; - genetics of
complex characters; - intra and inter-speciﬁc develop-
mental genetics of vulva diﬀerentiation, sex determina-
tion, behavior and host-parasite interactions;
A session will also be dedicated to Caenorhabditis spp.
evolutionary biology resources.
We plan to host approximately 50 participants. If you
would like to attend, please send a brief description
of your research together with a title and abstract of
a 30min talk or poster to Henrique Teot´ onio (teoto-
nio@igc.gulbenkian.pt), until the 15th of January 2006.
There is no registration fee and accommodation and
subsistence costs will be covered for all participants.
Commercial participants will however have to pay 450?
for registration. We will also be able to give 20 travel
aid grants for European researchers (350? each) and 5
travel grants for non-European researchers (700? each),
with preference given to early-stage researchers (PhDs
and PostDocs).

Training in TropicalLakes
The Nyanza Project is an NSF-sponsored Research
Training Course in Tropical Lakes. Our research focus
is on paleoclimates, limnogeology, limnology, aquatic
ecology and evolution. Every summer a small num-
ber of undergrad and a few grad students are selected
through a competitive application process to partici-
pate in a course with lectures and signiﬁcant indepen-
dent research projects, based on the shores of Lake Tan-
ganyika (East Africa). This is Africa’s oldest and deep-
est rift lake, with an extraordinary paleoclimate record
in its sediments, a dynamic tectonic history, very pro-
ductive ﬁsheries, and highly derived, co-evolved, largely
endemic fauna. If your career objectives are linked
with any of these research topics, if you enjoy inter-
disciplinary scientiﬁc interaction and if you see tropical
lakes as model systems for understanding the natural
world and potentially part of your research career, have
a look at our web page: http://www.geo.arizona.edu/-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
