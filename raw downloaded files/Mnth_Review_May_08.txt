ParasitesAndSelectionInFish
Jul21-25
The Fisheries Society of the British Isles is holding its
annual International Symposium at the University of
Cardiﬀ, Wales, UK from 21st to 25th July, 2008, enti-
tled:
Parasites as Agents of Selection in Fish: from genes to
ecosystems
Parasites are increasingly recognised by biologists as
important mediators of ecological interactions and
agents of natural and sexual selection in host popu-
lations. Fish serve as hosts to a wide range of ’con-
ventional’ parasitic organisms (i.e. agents of disease
such as viruses, fungi, lice and worms), and have proven
to be extremely good models for testing key hypothe-
ses in lab and ﬁeld research. Furthermore, invest-
ment in courtship and parental behaviour risks para-
sitism by conspeciﬁcs that engage in ’sneaky’ mating
tactics. There is currently considerable interest in the
impacts of both ’conventional’ heterospeciﬁc parasites,
and conspeciﬁc ’cuckoos’ on the ﬁtness of host individ-
uals and the consequences of parasitism for populations
and communities. This meeting addresses some of the
most relevant and pressing research themes in ﬁsh par-
asitology, behaviour and evolutionary ecology.
Themes include:
Parasites, genes and evolution.
Fitness consequences of infections.
Ecological implications of parasitism.
Host-parasite interactions in altered environments.
Invited speakers: Kevin Laﬀerty, Mathias Wegner,
Steve Feist, Alexandra Grutter, Bernd Sures, Cameron
Goater, David Marcogliese, Scott Monks, Martin Re-
ichard, Joern Scharsack and Chris Williams
Conveners: Dr Iain Barber (University of Leicester) and
Dr Jo Cable (University of Cardiﬀ).Early registration deadline: 30 April 2008.

CornellU Female mate choice
symposium
The upcoming ISBE (International Society for Behav-
ioral Ecology) meeting at Cornell provides an opportu-
nity to organize symposia on the last day of the con-
ference to discuss speciﬁc issues in behavioral and evo-
lutionary ecology. I plan to submit a proposal for a
symposium on variation in female choice and context-
dependent female choice. The goal of this symposium is
to highlight this issue to generate increased interest in
this ﬁeld and to bring together people who have inter-
ests in this topic. My hope is to generate discussion of
this issue, establish which areas are in the greatest need
of attention, and provide some direction for future re-
search in this ﬁeld. The format is not yet ﬁxed, but will
most likely be a mixture of contributed talks with sig-
niﬁcant time for discussion. Ideally talks will highlight
new or important ﬁndings in this area (selection, choice,
cognitive considerations, speciation), develop theory in
this area, and/ or provide some perspective for the fu-
ture. If you are planning to attend the ISBE meeting
and would like to contribute to this symposium, please
contact me as soon as possible for further information.
I’d also like to gauge the level of interest in this topic, so
if you would be interested in attending, but not neces-
sarily presenting, I would also appreciate hearing from
you.
Thank you,

Edinburgh ParasitoidEvolution
Jun5-6
Second call for Behavioural Evolution of Parasitoids
(BEPAR) workshop, June 5-6, Edinburgh, UK.
We are extremely pleased to make the second announce-
ment of the forthcoming Behavioural Evolution of Para-
sitoids (BEPAR) workshop “Genetic and Genomic Ap-
proaches for Parasitoid Behavioural Evolution”, to be
held at the University of Edinburgh, June 5-6 2008.
This ESF-supported workshop aims to bring together
parasitoid researchers interested in the behaviour and
evolution of parasitoid insects, to explore how new ge-
netic and genomic techniques can inform and enhance
our research. Whilst our focus through the invited
speakers is on genetic approaches, we wish to encourage
as broad a range of participants as possible, including
those with little or no genetics background. This way
we hope to facilitate interactions between parasitoid re-
searchers using diﬀerent techniques to answer similar
questions, as well as highlight new questions that we
need to address. As such, we particularly would like to
encourage early-stage researchers to attend.
The invited speakers will cover topics spanning host-
parasite interactions, life-history evolution, reproduc-
tive behaviour, sex allocation and social behaviour.
Conﬁrmed speakers include: Leo Beukeboom, Lex
Kraaijeveld, Hans Smid, Amy Toth, Saskya van
Nouhuys, Fabrice Vavre and Jack Werren. In addition
to the invited speakers, we invite abstract submissions
for both spoken and poster presentations.
The workshop has a fee of £120 that will cover accom-
modation, daytime meals and the workshop fee. There
will also be a wine reception at the end of ﬁrst day.
Delegate number is limited to 80. Registration is via
the dedicated workshop website, where further details
of the locations and accommodation can also be found.
http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/bepar2008/Home.html
The closing date for registrations is May 2nd 2008.
We very much look forward to welcoming you to Edin-
burgh this June.

URennes AdaptiveDynamics Jun4-6
Workshop Adaptive Dynamics of Parasitoids
Invitation for contributed speakers
Where : Biological Staion at Paimpont When : 4-6 juin
2008 Organised by :
Jacques van Alphen and Joan van Baaren (UMR CNRS
6553 ECOBIO), Universit´ e de Rennes 1, as part of
the project COMPAREVOL ( http://comparevol.univ-
rennes1.fr/ ) Funded by : BEPAR (ESF), Universit´ e
de Rennes 1, Agrocampus Rennes, CNRS, Rennes
m´ etropole
Description of the workshop: The workshop is an
initiative of the ESF Network BEPAR ( http://-
bepar.sophia.inra.fr/ ). The workshop will bring to-
gether leading scientists in the ﬁeld of adaptive dy-
namics with experts on parasitoid behavioural ecol-
ogy, in the aim to advance our understanding of the
evolution of parasitoid diversity by adaptive speciation
by host and habitat shifts. It second aim is to study
how behvavioural ecological theory can be merged with
adaptive dynamics to study host shifts in parasitoids in
adaptive dynamics models rich in behavioural details.
(i) scientiﬁc summary Much of the theory developed
for understanding and predicting the evolution of be-
havioural and life-history traits of parasitoids is based
on simpliﬁed optimization approaches, which are ap-
plicable only if selection is frequency-independent. In
contrast, empirical ecological research reveals the ubiq-
uity of frequency-dependent selection pressures on al-
most all lifehistory traits of interest. Such frequency
dependence occurs whenever selection depends on the
phenotypic composition of a population, which is the
rule in natural systems Even, when frequency depen-
dent selection is taken into account for by using a game
theoretical approach, the environment is generally con-
sidered to be static. Adaptive dynamics theory can re-solve this mismatch between theory and the real world.
Adaptive dynamics is a recent body of theory, which
is quite successful in modelling evolutionary processes
that are diﬃcult to analyze with classical game theoret-
ical models or population genetic models. The method
takes into account that an evolutionary change in an
organism causes also a change in the way the organism
experiences its environment. This allows an evolving
population to escape from a ﬁtness valley and reach a
new ﬁtness maximum. The method is particularly suc-
cessful in explaining evolutionary branching and hence
in modelling speciation events. Hymenopteran insect
parasitoids are disputably the second most species-rich
group of insects after the coleopterans, with an es-
timated number of species well in excess of 200,000.
The presence of species rich genera with sympatric
species specialized in exploiting diﬀerent but related
host species, host plants or diﬀerent habitats, suggest
that ecological speciation by host or habitat shifts plays
an important role in evolutionary radiation and speci-
ation of parasitoids. A key to understanding host and
habitat shifts in parasitoids is the foraging behaviour
of female parasitoids. Parasitoid foraging behaviour is
under strong natural selection because each step in a
sequence of behavioural decisions has consequences for
the number of oﬀspring produced during adult lifespan.
Parasitoids must ﬁrst ﬁnd the habitat of its host, often
by attraction to olfactory cues, next they must search
the host habitat to ﬁnd a host. After encountering a
host the parasitoid must decide if she accepts or rejects
the host, and if a host is accepted how many eggs should
be laid and which sex the oﬀspring should have. Finally,
parasitoids must decide how long to continue searching
in a particular host habitat. A rich literature of deduc-
tive behavioural ecological models predicts the optimal
decisions for each of these steps in a particular envi-
ronment and there is ample empirical evidence showing
that parasitoid foraging behaviour is often close to the
predicted optimum for that environment. Moreover,
comparative studies based on independent contrasts
between phylogenetically close species have provided
further evidence that parasitoid foraging behaviour is
adaptive. Behavioural ecological evidence, thus, sug-
gests that a parasitoid female choosing a diﬀerent habi-
tat to search for hosts, or accepting a new host species,
would have a high probability decreasing her ﬁtness and
hence that host and habitat shifts would be diﬃcult. In
contrast, adaptive dynamics theory shows how selection
originating from local ecological interactions may drive
surprisingly rapid adaptive radiations. However, adap-
tive dynamics models so far lack the behavioural details
of interest to behavioural ecologists. The evolutionary
dynamics of parasitoid biodiversity, in particular eco-
logical speciation by host or habitat shifts has so far14 EvolDir May 1, 2008
received little attention. By combining the expertise of
parasitoid behavioural ecologists with that of adaptive
dynamics theorists, the

speculative ideas that were discussed at the ﬁeld’s in-
ception have matured to the extent that new confer-
ences and journals devoted to them are being estab-
lished: synthesising artiﬁcial cells, simulating biological
networks, exploiting biological substrates for computa-
tion and control, and deploying bio-inspired engineering
are all now cutting-edge practice.
The ALIFE XI conference provides an opportunity for
those working across these topics to get together and
exchange ideas and results. To this end, the confer-
ence will present a selection of the best current work in
the ﬁeld, highlight new directions for investigation, and
present high-proﬁle keynote speakers.
Papers are welcome in all areas of the ﬁeld, includ-
ing: . Synthesis and origin of life, self-organization,
self-replication, artiﬁcial chemistries . Evolution and
adaptation, evolutionary dynamics, evolutionary games
. Coevolution, major evolutionary transitions, levels of
selection, ecosystems . Development, diﬀerentiation,
and regulation; generative representations . Synthetic
biology . Self-organizing technology, self-* computing
and computational ecosystems . Unconventional and
biologically inspired computing . Bio-inspired robots
and embodied cognition, autonomous agents, evolution-
ary robotics . Collective behaviour, communication,
cooperation . Artiﬁcial consciousness; the relationship
between life and mind . Philosophical, ethical, and cul-
tural implications . Mathematical and philosophical
foundations of ALife, new and creative syntheses
Several artiﬁcial life “themes” have been proposed as
live research topics around which conference sessions
may organise. See www.alifexi.org/themes for full de-
tails.LOCATION
The conference will be held in Winchester, a beautiful
historic city in southern England known for its 11th-
century cathedral and 12th-century castle. Winchester
is set in forested countryside about an hour south-west
of London and Heathrow airport, and a few miles from
the host institution, the University of Southampton.

GeneticInfoSystems
Graduate student position in molecular evolution of ge-
netic information systems
Genetic information is stored in the cell in the form of
DNA, which the cell cannot access directly. Instead,
DNA information undergoes extensive, multistep pro-
cessing before it can be acted upon to direct cellular
functions. One of these processes, alternative mRNA
splicing, not only transmits genetic information but
also enhances it by generating multiple alternative ge-netic messages from the same gene. The cell expands
considerable amount of resources to generate these al-
ternative messages and while some are essential for the
proper functioning and development of the cell, the sig-
niﬁcance of others is subject of great debate since their
function in the cell is unclear. Are they errors tolerated
by the cell or do they represent an as yet unknown type
of genetic information or a novel regulatory process?
Graduate student positions are available, either MSc
or PhD, to evaluate the signiﬁcance of alternative mes-
sages by comparing their production in a variety of an-
imals including primates, other mammals, birds, ﬁsh,
and amphibians. Our guiding principle is that if alter-
native messages are functionally important then we will
be able to trace their evolutionary development and un-
cover evidence of their role in the various animals we
will investigate.
Student ﬁnancial support is available for Canadian cit-
izens and landed immigrants.

Description
The functional Traits and Dynamic of Ecosystems
(TDE) group is looking for a highly motivated PhD
student or postdoc associate to take part in the ANR
funded project DIVERSITALP (Forecasting the im-
pacts of global changes on French Alpine Flora: dis-
tribution of speciﬁc, functional and phylogenetic di-
versities, simulations and conservation strategies). Al-
though there is now convincing evidence of ongoing cli-
matic change and its impacts of life on Earth, one major
limitation impeding the use of models for implement-
ing sound management plans and adaptation strategies
to forthcoming global changes is that the mechanisms
structuring the distribution of species, functional and
phylogenetic diversities are loosely known. This is par-
ticularly the case in Alpine ecosystem. The PhD stu-
dent or postdoc will have to investigate the mechanisms
that shape plant community structure in the Alpine
Region by quantifying the relative importance of niche-
based processes (habitat ﬁltering vs competitive exclu-
sion) and neutral processes. To do so, mechanisms of
plant communities? assemblage and biodiversity main-
tenance will be studied in the light of species? environ-
mental niche (climatic, soil, topographic), functional
traits (? and ? niche traits) and phylogenetic relation-
ships. Theoretical models will have to be constructed
and tested on existing data. Experimental studies using
mesocosmes could be envisaged.

Project Description: This project involves studying the
population genetic structure of a nuisance microalga,
in relation to its invasion and dispersal patterns. It
thus has both a basic science approach as well as an
applied aspect. The background is that a large num-
ber of Nordic lakes have become invaded or dominated
by the noxious microalgal species Gonyostomum semen
(Raphidophyte) during the past decades. This phyto-
plankton species forms intense blooms and expels slimy
threads that cause skin irritation to bathers as well
as clogging of ﬁlters, thereby reducing the recreational
value of lakes and water quality. It is unclear whether
the species has been spreading to new lakes or simply
become more abundant due to changes in the environ-
ment. This position will involve using DNA techniques
to determine genetic proﬁles for Gonyostomum strains,
and subsequently population structure as well as geo-
graphical patterns.
This position is suitable for students interested in ap-
proaching evolution questions with molecular tools.
The project will involve traveling to sampling locations
in Sweden and neighboring countries, which is why a
driver’s license is necessary. The daily work will be very
lab-oriented, including culturing of algae and molecular
analyses.
Qualiﬁcations: Requirements for this position are an
MSc or comparable degree in evolution preferably with
an aquatic evolution specialization. The successful can-
didate will have experience in PCR techniques. A
driver’s license is required, as is good knowledge of writ-
ten and spoken English.

LundU DamselﬂySpeciation
Clinal variation, hybridization and speciation in
calopterygid damselﬂies
A PhD-fellowship is available for three years to study
the ecology and genetics of a hybrid zone between C.
splendens and C. xanthostoma in southern France. The
candidate is supposed to spend 50 % of his research time
in France and 50 % in Sweden. The project is partMay 1, 2008 EvolDir 21
of collaboration between the Department of Ecology
at Lund University (Sweden) and CNRS at Toulouse
(France), aimed to foster European research collabora-
tion.
Field work and experiments will mainly be performed
between May and August in France, and laboratory
work, data analyses and theoretical work in Sweden.
The candidate is expected to perform ﬁeld experiments
(mate presentations, phenotypic manipulations) along-
side with spatial analyses of phenotypic variation in key
phenotypic traits, such as the degree of wing melani-
sation between and within these species. These ﬁeld
studies will be performed across the hybrid zone south
of the Loire River as well as along altitudinal gradients
up in to the Pyrenees. There will also be opportunities
for the candidate to investigate other issues such as the
importance of plastic mate preferences in maintaining
sexual isolation and species boundaries. Field facilities
are provided by CNRS in Moulis, and laboratory facil-
ities by the Department of Ecology at Lund University.
We are seeking a highly motivated, independent student
who is willing to work both in the ﬁeld and in the lab-
oratory. Strong collaborative and communicative skills
are needed, and knowledge in French is helpful, but
not necessary. Previous experience with ﬁeld work in
evolutionary ecology, molecular work, statistics and/or
modelling will be considered an advantage. A strong in-
terest in theoretical aspects of ecology and evolutionary
biology are essential.

PostglacialBiogeography
PhD Studentship: Postglacial biogeography of Ireland’s
rare arctic-alpine carnations.
Applications are invited for a 3 year PhD project in-
vestigating the biogeography and genetic diversity of
rare arctic-alpine plants on Ireland’s Western Seaboard.
Arenaria ciliata and Minuartia recurva occur on a few
high mountains sites in Ireland, with their closest sister
populations over 1,000km away in the Alps and Iberia
respectively. This project will use a variety of molecular
marker methods including AFLP and chloroplast hap-
lotype analysis to build a putative postglacial migration
model explaining how and why these and 6 other related
Caryophyllaceae species came to have their current dis-
tributions. This project is ideally suited to a candidate
with strong ﬁeld experience of the European ﬂora and
expertise in molecular markers/ DNA sequencing. Over
the course of the project summer ﬁeld collections will
be made in Ireland, Britain, Scandinavia, Iberia and
the Alps. The post carries a stipend of euro16,000 per
annum, with additional funds to cover university fees,
travel to conferences and advanced training in popula-
tion genetics/ molecular ecology methods.
The start date for the Project is June/ July 2008. The
studentship will be based at the Molecular Ecology Lab-
oratory, NUI Maynooth, in collaboration with National
Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin (Dr Colin Kelle-
her). The National University of Ireland, Maynooth is
located in a small university town 30km from Dublin
and hosts one of the leading biological science clusters
in Ireland. Applications, including a personal state-
ment, up to date CV and the contact details of 3 ref-
erees should be sent to conor.v.meade at nuim.ie. or
posted to:

One of the great challenges of the post genomic era is
to understand how the interaction of complex biologi-
cal processes is coordinated within cells. By combining
experimental approaches with mathematical modelling
we can provide novel insights into the regulation of bio-
logical processes and predict the potential consequences
of altering substrate levels and pathways.
This PhD project will focus on modelling the produc-
tion of diﬀerent steroid hormones during pregnancy.
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a mathe-
matical model that describes the regulation of and com-
plex interaction among intermediate substrates in the
foetal and placental steroid hormone synthesis path-
ways. The mathematical model is expected to improve
our understanding of how changes in the levels of inter-
mediate substrates aﬀect the diﬀerent steroid synthetic
pathways that are operating in the placenta and in the
foetus. This will help us to understand how placenta
and foetus co-ordinate the synthesis of the diﬀerent hor-
mones necessary for pregnancy success and provide in-
sight into how perturbations of steroid metabolism ul-
timately aﬀect the viability of the foetus and, subse-
quently, the long-term health of the oﬀspring.
The student will be part of a multidisciplinary inter-
national team. This theoretical project will use bio-
logical expertise and data generated in the laborato-
ries of AgResearch’s Reproductive Technologies Group
(Hamilton, New Zealand) and from INRA in Jouy en
Josas, France.
The successful candidate will extend his/hers skills
in mathematical modelling and computer simulations
to describe the performance of complex systems and
obtain experience in epigenetics and systems biology.
These are highly sought-after skills in the interface be-
tween mathematics, physics and the life sciences.
We are seeking enthusiastic and talented graduates who
wish to take advantage of this exciting opportunity to
contribute to the development of systems biology in
New Zealand. We would particularly like to hear from
applicants with at least a second honours degree in a
subject with a strong applied mathematics content such
as physics, mathematics, statistics or engineering and a
demonstrated interest in biology or biochemistry; expe-
rience with mathematical modelling in the life sciences
is an advantage. Good written and verbal communica-May 1, 2008 EvolDir 23
tion skills and a high level of motivation and commit-
ment are required.
This PhD is funded by the National Research Centre
for Growth and Development (NRCGD) and is based
at AgResearch’s theoretical biology group in Hamilton,
NZ.
The position is open until a suitable candidate has been
found.

*Endemism and speciation in a mega diverse island
ecosystem: the /Arthroclianthus///Nephrodesmus/
(Leguminosae) species complex in **New Caledonia***
* *
Project summary
* *
The /Arthroclianthus///Nephrodesmus/ (Legumi-
nosae, tribe Desmodieae) species complex, endemic
to New Caledonia, displays striking morphological
and ecological diversities. The distinction between
within-species and among-species variability is diﬃ-
cult. Twenty-four species are currently described, but
42 morpho-species (37 for /Arthroclianthus/, 5 for
/Nephrodesmus/) have been detected in a preliminary
survey. Several aspects will be considered:
1) Systematics: the student will establish a molecu-
lar phylogeny (using both organelle and nuclear DNAmarkers) in order to distinguish the major clades, re-
construct the genealogical relationships among taxa, es-
timate the date of appearance and timing of diversiﬁca-
tion in the diﬀerent clades, and propose a biogeographic
scenario.
2) Evolution of ﬂoral morphology: on the basis of the
molecular phylogeny, the student will examine the evo-
lution of reproductive characters and assess the corre-
lation between reproductive morphology and ecology.
The two genera diﬀer in their species diversity, which
may be linked to the apparition of a pollination syn-
drome in /Arthroclianthus/: whereas all other species
of the tribe are insect-pollinated, these species are sus-
pected to be bird-pollinated. The correlation between
rapid speciation and bird-pollination was previously ob-
served in other genera of the family (e.g. /Chadsia/ and
/Pyranthus/).
3) Genetic diversity: because the species are very
closely related, the within-species genetic diversity will
have to be considered in order to delimit taxa and study
their relationships. Moreover, events of reticulate evo-
lution are stongly suspected and speciation may still
be on-going. A ﬁne-scale genetic study will therefore
be performed within small groups of species that will
be circumscribed based on the molecular phylogeny.
4) Taxonomy and conservation : based on molecular
data and morphological observations, species delimi-
tation will be re-evaluated. The student will subse-
quently use Geographical Information System (GIS) in
order to characterize the IUCN conservation status of
all taxa under study. This will be particularly impor-
tant since the /Arthroclianthus/ and/ Nephrodesmus/
mainly occur in sclerophyllous forests, which have suf-
fer a drastic range contraction (only 1% of their initial
range remains) and maquis, which is under huge human
pression (mining activity and its related urbanization).
Scientiﬁc context
This PhD project will be performed within the broad
framework of the program “BIONEOCAL: Phyloge-
netic and population studies of the emergence of en-
demism in New Caledonia”, funded by the French Na-
tional Agency for Research (ANR). This project ﬁts the
main research areas of the UMR 5202 ’OSEB’, and the
PhD student will therefore have many opportunities to
collaborate and share experience with other members
of the team.

RhodesU WeevilPopulations
Master’s Bursary Available
A bursary is available for a Master’s student in the De-
partment of Zoology and Entomology at Rhodes Uni-
versity to develop and analyse microsatellite markers
in the weevil, Porthetes hispidus. P. hispidus is host
speciﬁc to the cycad Encephalartos friderici-guilielmi
and is probably its primary pollinator. This cycad
is distributed mostly around the Cathcart-Queenstown
district of the Eastern Cape and is found as isolated
colonies separated by a range of distances with one
or two isolated populations occurring near Kokstad,
KwaZulu Natal. Population genetic structure in this
weevil could be mediated by distance between popu-
lations of its host plant, host and population ﬁdelity,or extinction-recolonisation dynamics, among other fac-
tors. This project aims to determine levels of genetic
variation and patterns of genetic structure in this wee-
vil, as well as gain insight into its mating system.
Though the project is primarily lab based there may
be some opportunity for ﬁeld work as it will be use-
ful to sample from populations that have not yielded
weevils in past collecting trips. A keen interest in evo-
lutionary biology and some background in molecular
biology would be valuable attributes for candidates for
this bursary. Submit CV and brief statement of inter-

A 4-year PhD-position in Evolutionary Ecology is avail-
able at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm Univer-
sity, Sweden. Main supervisor Dr. Karl Gotthard. The
subject of the project is “Evolution of developmental
plasticity in insects” and last date for applying is May
2.
Evolution of developmental plasticity in insects
Developmental plasticity that leads to alternative phe-
notypes depending on environment is often controlled
by developmental switches/ thresholds. Such switches
integrate environmental and genetic eﬀects on pheno-
types and are important mechanisms for the evolu-
tion of adaptive plasticity. This project will explore
the evolution of developmental plasticity by mechanis-
tic and genetic studies of developmental switches, as
well as studies of how the expressed phenotypic vari-
ation inﬂuences ﬁtness in realistic ecological settings.
The project focuses on larval development in butter-
ﬂies of the genus Pararge and deals with developmental
switches of two diﬀerent types (life cycle and color di-
morphisms) that are sensitive to diﬀerent environmen-
tal cues. The prospective student will perform breeding
and selection experiments to estimate the level of devel-
opmental coordination and genetic architecture of the
switch mechanisms. He/She will also test the potential
adaptive value of developmental switches by perform-
ing laboratory and ﬁeld experiments that investigate
ﬁtness consequences of variation in phenotype (life his-
tory traits and larval color morphs) in realistic environ-May 1, 2008 EvolDir 25

I am looking for an independent student with a strong
interest in evolutionary theory and experience of em-
pirical work in any of the ﬁelds of evolutionary ecology,
behavioral ecology, quantitative genetics, and life his-
tory evolution. Experience of experimental work using
insects will be considered an asset.
The Department of Zoology at Stockholm University,
Sweden oﬀers a very strong research environment in
evolutionary ecology, excellent lab and ﬁeld station fa-
cilities as well as a stimulating scientiﬁc atmosphere

UEastAnglia Evolution of
reproductive success
NERC CASE PhD studentship, 2008
The making of a successful male: an integrated study
of male reproductive success in a pest insect.
Start: October 2008.
Location: School of Biological Sciences, University of
East Anglia, Norwich, NR47TJ and Oxitec Ltd, Abing-
don, OX14 4RX.
Supervisors: Tracey Chapman, Matt Gage ( http://-
www1.uea.ac.uk/cm/home/schools/sci/bio ) and Luke
Alphey (CASE partner) ( http://www.oxitec.com/ ).
Aim: To take a broad approach to integrate the un-
derstanding of fundamental, evolutionarily-important
traits in insect pest control.
Summary: Male reproductive success comprises pre-
and post-mating components that are rarely subject to
integrated study. This studentship will address this,
and apply pure and applied research approaches to a
pest of signiﬁcant economic importance for which trans-
genic insect technology is well advanced. We have ap-28 EvolDir May 1, 2008
plied experimental evolution to the Mediterranean fruit
ﬂy (medﬂy) and now seek to determine reproductive
ﬁtness and divergence in male reproductive traits. We
predict that males evolving under increased sexual com-
petition will evolve more eﬀective courtship and signif-
icantly higher post-mating competitiveness. This will
reveal the traits that make a successful male medﬂy,
and also whether pre- or post-mating traits are more
strongly selected. The student will pursue this work
at a novel molecular level by utilising the expertise of
the CASE partner to conduct a targeted transcriptional
analysis of important male reproductive proteins in the
evolved lines. The project will extend into the applied
domain by testing whether pre- and post-mating traits
in evolved lines and in transgenics produced for a novel
method of insect control, vary predictably in their re-
sponse to the key environmental variable of nutritional
status. The results will reveal potential trade-oﬀs and
the likely eﬃcacy of the control strains under varying
conditions.
Training: The student will join the Evolu-
tion, Ecology and Biodiversity Group at UEA
(http://bioweb2.bio.uea.ac.uk/research/themes/-
organismsenvironment/eeb.html ). The School of
Biological Sciences at UEA ( http://www.uea.ac.uk/-
bio/) provides an excellent Ph.D. research and training
environment in a Grade 5 research department. The
CASE partner Oxitec employs 24 research staﬀ and is
an exciting and challenging environment in which to
work. It is at the forefront on a world-wide scale in
the development of insect transgenesis. The link with
Oxitec will therefore provide invaluable insight and
experience for the student into work in the commercial
world, and will oﬀer technical expertise of the highest
standard.
Eligibility: Applicants should have a strong de-
gree in biological sciences or genetics. The full
award is available only to residents of the UK,
or those satisfying NERC eligibility requirements
(http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/postgrad/-
eligibility.asp ). The award includes a standard NERC
stipend supplemented by 1000GBP per annum by the
CASE partner. The student will spend years 1 and 3
at UEA and year 2 with the CASE partner.
Applications: Informal enquiries to Tracey Chap-
man (tracey.chapman@uea.ac.uk). Formal applica-
tions should be made via the Faculty of Science
Post-Graduate Oﬃce (scipg@uea.ac.uk), see http://-

A three year Ph.D. doctoral position in population ge-

Institute of Biology, University of Iceland. Possibility
of part-time teaching as Teaching Assistant (TA) which

Subject: Natural selection and population structure in
Atlantic cod
Project Description: The question of population struc-
ture and the inﬂuence of locus-speciﬁc natural selection,
in the abundant Atlantic cod is still debated. The main
objective is twofold. First, to develop and apply DNA
sequence variation of both introns and exons of sev-
eral randomly chosen nuclear loci Atlantic cod Gadus
morhua to answer questions of population structure in
Icelandic cod. Second, to develop and analyze DNA se-
quence variation of several genes showing locus-speciﬁc
eﬀects important for functional diﬀerentiation within
and among local populations. This will allow us to bet-
ter sort out the eﬀects of history, locus-speciﬁc eﬀects
(natural selection, mutation, assortative mating and re-
combination) and genome-wide eﬀects (such as random
genetic drift, population structure, gene ﬂow and in-
breeding).
The distinction between locus-speciﬁc and genome-wide
eﬀects is crucial in population genomics and genetics,

ULund 3 SexualSelection Speciation
Internships available at the University of Lund in Swe-
den
Internships are available for students interested in evo-
lutionary ecology in general, and sexual selection and
speciation in particular
We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic
students, with a strong interest in ecology and evolu-
tion, and who are prepared to work independently, both
in the ﬁeld and the laboratory. Students will work in
close collaboration with PhD-students and postdocs at
the Department of Animal Ecology in Lund (Sweden).
Studentships are available for two projects (more de-
tails below):
1) Calopteryx damselﬂies
2) Ischnura damselﬂies
Fieldwork will take place between early June and late
July (2 months). It would be of advantage if the stu-
dent has a driver’s license. Time and length of stay can
be agreed on personal preferences. We provide hous-
ing and travel costs (for students coming from outside
of Sweden). The working language of the group is En-
glish. If you are interested, please send us an e-mail
announcing your interest no later than the 31 March
2008.
1) Detailed project description: Calopteryx damselﬂies
Main Coordinator: Maren Wellenreuther
Calopteryx splendens and C. virgo are two damselﬂy
species that occur throughout most parts of Europe,
and are commonly found along rivers and small fresh-
water streams. In Sweden, these two damselﬂy species
can either occur in mixed sympatric populations or in
distinct allopatric populations. Previous work from our
lab has shown that the strength and direction of selec-tion on morphological characters diﬀers between sym-
patric and allopatric populations. Other ecological fac-
tors, such as predation by birds, has also been shown
to further act as a selective force on these populations.
Our ﬁeldwork aims to quantify the relative strength
and direction of these selective forces on damselﬂy pop-
ulations in nature. Our study populations are within
a short distance from Lund (1-4 hours by car), and
we will visit several populations repeatedly during the
ﬁeld season in June and July. At each population, we
will ﬁrst record the basic data to describe the ecologi-
cal setting of the population (density of heterospeciﬁcs
and conspeciﬁcs, forest cover, etc.), and then a sub-
sample of the population will be caught (approx. 20
individuals) and stored in nets. At a subset of these
populations we will also conduct experiments to in-
vestigate the factors (mainly morphological) aﬀecting
mating propensity in these species. To do this, we will
tether damselﬂies with a string of cotton to a bamboo
stick and will then present the tethered damselﬂy to
potential mates. The response of these potential mates
to the tethered damselﬂy will be recorded. After the
experiment, all damselﬂies will be placed in nets. All
caught damselﬂies (from the random sub-samples and
the experiments) will be transported back to the Uni-
versity in Lund, where we subsequently measure the
morphological characters. Finally, the ecological and
morphological data will get entered into a database and
analysed.
In July, it is planned to drive to Finland, and to
work for 2 weeks on the damselﬂy populations near
Jyv¨ askyl¨ a. This work will be conducted in collab-
oration with Katja Tynkkynen at the University of
Jyv¨ askyl¨ a.
2) Detailed project description: Ischnura project
Main Coordinator: Tom Gosden
Heritable colour polymorphisms within species have
proven to be useful model systems to investigate a vari-
ety of important questions in evolutionary biology, such
as genetics, developmental biology and the ecology of
frequency-dependent selection. However, a relatively
unexplored research area with important implications
for such polymorphisms is population and species di-
vergence in mate preferences. If both colour and mate
preferences are heritable traits, which is often the case,
then sexual selection theory predicts that non-random
mating should lead to the build-up of genetic corre-
lations between colour and mate preference, through
the formation of linkage disequilibrium between loci for
these diﬀerent traits. Such a genetic correlation can
lead to rapid population divergence in mate preference
and sexual isolation between allopatric populations as a30 EvolDir May 1, 2008
by-product of locally varying sexual selection pressures.
By examining several populations of the female lim-
ited colour polymorphic species of damselﬂy Ischnura
elegans, it will be possible to explore population di-
vergence in male and female mate preference, intersex-
ual conﬂicts between males and females and investigate
the role of such conﬂicts in the maintenance of diﬀer-
ent morphs and population morph frequency dynam-
ics. The female morphs consist of one androchrome
(male coloured) and two gynochromes, (infuscans and
infucans-obsoleta). See Picture

Simula Research Lab
Simula Research Laboratory conducts basic research in
the ﬁelds of communication technology, software engi-
neering and scientiﬁc computing. The research in the
Scientiﬁc Computing (SC) department is focused on
the development of numerical methods, algorithms and
software, and large scale biomedical and systems bi-
ology oriented simulation studies applying these meth-
ods. In recent years, the main application area for com-
putational research studies has been the simulation of
the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart. Cur-
rently, we plan to extend our computational research
to simulations of the evolutionary dynamics of genetic
networks controlling the properties of organisms.
The aim of the research project is to study key evolu-
tionary processes such as the adaptation of organisms
to their environment, the splitting up of a species into
multiple species and the development of multicellular
organisms from a single fertilized cells. A key aspect of
the research will be to study how the architecture and
dynamics of genome organization and gene regulatory
network structure inﬂuence the properties of organisms
and hence how they inﬂuence the above mentioned evo-
lutionary processes and how this contrasts with ﬁndings
from more classical population genetics models.
Our understanding of genome organization and gene
regulatory networks has changed dramatically over the
last decade. A large part of DNA that was previously
considered junk turns out the be functional after all,coding for RNAs that are however not translated into
proteins. These RNAs in turn are often involved in reg-
ulating the expression of genes, which were previously
thought to be exclusively regulated by proteins. Incor-
porating these new insights into our models is another
key aspect of the research project.
Modeling formalisms used will typically be discrete,
individual- based, event-based, and often spatially ex-
tended and will involve the explicit modeling of the
evolution of genes, genomes and gene regulatory net-
works determining the properties of simulated agents.
The project will be supervised by a new member of
our research group, Dr. Kirsten ten Tusscher ( http://
www-binf.bio.uu.nl/khwjtuss/).
Simula oﬀers excellent opportunities for doing high
quality research, generous support for travels and
equipment, and competitive salary (around 47.000,-
Euro/69.000,- USD for a Ph.D. position)
We are looking for candidates who fulﬁll one or more of
the following requirements: - a strong interest in evo-
lutionary biological research - a University degree in
computational biology, systems biology, biomedical en-
gineering, artiﬁcial life, artiﬁcial intelligence, computer
science, physics or applied mathematics - experience

of complex (biological) systems.

Title: Summer research experience for undergraduates
(REU) at UCLA
Location: Los Angeles, CA
Description: We are seeking 1 undergraduate applicant
for summer research on a project examining the evolu-
tionary impact of an invasive species. The REU stu-
dent will be able to participate in ﬁeld and laboratory
research and there is opportunity to develop an inde-
pendent project. The student will work under a faculty
mentor and closely with graduate students and post-
docs.
The REU student will assist on a project which
aims to determine if Paciﬁc tree frog (Pseudacris
regilla) tadpoles are adapting to an invasive preda-
tor, the red swamp crayﬁsh (Procambarus clarkii) in
the Santa Monica Mountains near Los Angeles, CA.
Anti-predator adaptations (morphological and behav-
ioral) will be compared between tadpoles from streams
with crayﬁsh and tadpoles from streams without cray-
ﬁsh. Tadpoles will be collected from the wild and pho-
tographed for morphological analysis. The behavioral
responses of tadpoles will then be tested to crayﬁsh
chemical cues and ﬁnally, a ﬁeld predation experiment
will be performed to determine the tadpoles’ abilities to
evade predation. In addition, the project will determinethe population genetic structure of the Paciﬁc tree frog
throughout the Santa Monica Mountains with speciﬁc
attention to the eﬀects of urbanization and roads on P.
regilla’s genetic structure. This project would allow the
REU student to learn molecular genetic techniques in
the laboratory.
Qualiﬁcations: Applicants must be US citizens and cur-
rently enrolled as undergraduates (no graduating se-
niors). Must be available for approximately 10 weeks
during the summer (June-September, start and end
dates ﬂexible). Enthusiasm for ecology and evolution-
ary biology and a positive attitude is a must. Students
wishing to attend graduate school for a Master’s or PhD
are desired. Must be physically willing and able to hike
in hot dry weather and get wet in the streams. Field
sites contain hazards such as poison oak, rattlesnakes,
and steep rocky terrain. Applications are encouraged
from students from groups underrepresented in the bi-
ological sciences.

Accelrys petition followup
Hi all - re. http://www.petitiononline.com/gcg/ A
huge THANKS to all of you that signed my petition!
Within the ﬁrst week online I got almost 150 signatures,
and John Devereux himself most recently signed it. I
sent Rob Brown of Accelrys an ’oﬃcial’ copy of the
petition and the signatures at the end of last month.
However, but not surprisingly, I have yet to receive one
word back from Accelrys. I realize that we can’t force
them to do anything, but I at least thought that they
would have the courtesy to respond to it somehow. The
petition did result in a news story though. GenomeWeb
News’ bioinformatics newsletter, BioInform, published
the story on April 4th. See my copy at:
http://bio.fsu.edu/ ˜ stevet/BioInformGCG.pdf Some
may feel that the BioInform story suggests the petition
was merely a means of inﬂuencing commercial negoti-
ations with Accelrys regarding code release, and have
nothing to do with public domain availability, but this
was never my objective. It is and remains a plea not to
kill the package, and in particular SeqLab, by whatever
means possible, but preferably within some type of open
source arrangement. Furthermore, Accelrys argues in
the article that many more people have signed the pe-
tition than bought in to the package, and that this
somehow invalidates the petition. This is completely
irrelevant as the GCG license has always been to an
institution, allowing as many people in that institution
access as wanted, not to individual investigators. Here
at FSU I have supported over 100 GCG users with oneGCG license over the years. June should be interesting
for us all. We’ll have to see if Accelrys honors their
commitment to those of us with “perpetual” licenses to
provide non-node-locked, non- expiring versions of the
license after June 30, 2008. Time will tell.
Cheers - Steve

Accelrys petition followup 2
Hello all -
A brief note to let you know what’s happened since my
posting this last Wednesday:
Rob Brown of Accelrys did contact me, ﬁnally. He says,
and I quote:
“The petition and the subsequent BioInform article
produced a signiﬁcant response and generated inquiries
from a number of third party companies who now wish
to discuss various possibilities relating to GCG with us.May 1, 2008 EvolDir 51
We are now in the process of following up on all of those
which is taking some time.”
So, it looks like some good has come out of the process,
although this doesn’t look like the open source type of
arrangement that many of us hoped for. Regardless, it
may mean that the package will not be dying.
And, Accelrys sent me my new non-node-locked, non-
expiring license key!

Accelrys petition followup 3
Hi all -
I would like to oﬀer my apology to Accelrys and its em-
ployees for suggesting that the company would not fol-
low through on their commitment to supply non-node-
locked, non-expiring license keys to all current GCG
custyomers with “perpetual” licenses. As I mentioned
in my last posting Accelrys is now involved in that pro-
cess and I have received my new key. It was never my
intent to discredit Accelrys, nor its employess. I merely
had not been informed that the process was underway.
I am sorry that I miswrote and hope that any hard
feelings can be overcome. Thank you.

Dear all,
I would like to thank you for your quick and helpful
replies concerning AFLPs. As many of you were inter-
ested in the answers, here comes a short summary of
them:
Puriﬁcation of selective PCR products: -most people
do not do a sephadex puriﬁcation because one might
loose fragments -those who do a sephadex puriﬁcation
report that this leads to a reduction of primer-dimers
and a better resolution and clarity in the range from 75-
500 bp -one can also try a puriﬁcation of PCR products
following precipitation protocols for sequencing
Sample volume: -1-3
[cid:image001.png@01C898A1.8EAF7840]
multiplexed PCR product in 10-15
[cid:image002.png@01C898A1.8EAF7840] l total
volume (HiDi and Standard)
Injection time: -10-40 (or even 90) seconds
PCR protocol: -use of other/better Taqs or PCR kits
(see also Trybush et al, Can. J. Bot. 84: 1347-1354
(2006)). -20-30x dilution of the multiplexed selective
PCR product will lead to better/higher peaks
Again, many thanks to all of you who helped, and good
luck with your AFLPs!

AmerGeneticsAssoc Awards
The Council of the American Genetics Association in-
vites applications from members of the Association for
support of special events. The Association expects
to make up to four awards of approximately $10,000-
15,000 this year. Eligible events include specialized52 EvolDir May 1, 2008
workshops open to Association members in areas of
great current interest and short courses in some aspect
of organismal genetics, but any event that would ad-
vance the purpose of the Association is eligible for sup-
port. We encourage members to think creatively about
the types of events they could oﬀer with support from
the Association. All applications received will be care-
fully reviewed.
An application for a Special Event Award should in-
clude the following items of information:
1. The name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) who will
be responsible for organizing the event and overseeing
the expenditure of any funds awarded.
2. The institution to which an award should be made,
including the complete address of the relevant institu-
tional department and the signature of an authorized
institutional representative indicating the institution’s
willingness to administer the award if granted.
3. The title of the event for which an award is re-
quested.
4. A rationale for the event explaining (a) why the
event is timely or needed, (b) how the planned event
will address the perceived need, and (c) how support
from American Genetics Association will improve the
event, e.g., by making it possible or by making it more
aﬀordable for graduate students and post-doctoral re-
search associates. The rationale need not be longer
than 1 page.
5. A description of the event including (if available):
a list of primary participants (e.g., workshop leaders,
course instructors), dates and location of the event, a
preliminary schedule for the event, and a plan for how
participants will be selected (if participation is limited).
The description need not be longer than 2 pages.
6. A budget for the event showing how funds provided
by an award from the Society would be used to sup-
port event activities. If funds are also being sought
from other sources, the budget should show both how
funds from the Association will be used and how funds
from other sources will be used. (The sources of other
funds need not be identiﬁed, but the application should
indicate whether the funds are in hand.)
Applications for a Special Event Award should be
emailed to Anjanette Baker at the AGA oﬃce (aga-
joh@oregonstate.edu). The Council will review all ap-
plications received before April 30, 2008, and make
award decisions at its annual meeting in June 2008.

We are performing a phylogeography study on the
anther smut fungus parasitizing plants from the
Caryophyllaceae family, and we would like ask Evoldir
members who happen to see some infection during hol-
idays, meetings or ﬁeld trip if they would be so kind
as sending us samples. The fungus Microbotryum vio-
laceum produces its spores in the anthers of the infectes
plants, that then become purple. We are most inter-
ested in spores from the plants Silene latifolia (=white
campion, Silene alba), Silene dioica and Silene vulgaris.
Samples from the US, the UK and South and Eastern
Europe would be the most valuable. Infected ﬂowers
should be put in paper bags, and we would like ideally
5-15 samples per population. We can send more details
and pictures. Many thanks in advance

Chloroplast subst rates
Dear Evoldir members,
Is anyone aware of published evolutionary rates for spe-
ciﬁc chloroplast genes, as opposed to whole genome
rates? I am particularly interested in the cpDNA
protein-coding genes matK and ndhF, but I would also
like to get a feel for the range of rates seen in other
genes.May 1, 2008 EvolDir 53
There’s a nice table in Hewitt (2001, Mol. Ecol., 10,
537-549) that includes Li’s (1997, Molecular Evolution.

of synonymous & non-synonymous in cpDNA, but I
have been unable to ﬁnd other relevant literature. Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

tion about estimating founder population size. The

ORIGINAL POSTING
Dear EvolDir members
I am attempting to estimate founder population size for
a recently introduced population (c. seven years/max
10 generations) of Anolis using microsatellite data.
Standard estimates of eﬀective population size are likely
to be inappropriate in this case since mutation rate can-
not be accurately estimated due to the recent nature of
the introduction.
I have come across a paper (Rasner et al 2004, Molecu-
lar Ecology) that attempts to answer the question using
the number of alleles (n) within the most variable locus
in the introduced population as an absolute minimum
estimate of the founder population size. (Eight gener-
ations were assumed to have passed between founding
and sampling). The paper then uses simulation to re-
sample a speciﬁed number of ’founder individuals’ from
the native population 1000 times and calculates the pro-
portion of times that at least this number (n) of alleles
are captured in the samples. The smallest number of
founders consistent with the data was taken to be the
number that gave a probability >0.05 of capturing n
observed alleles (Rasner et al 2004).
My questions are
ﬁrst, does anyone know of a method for estimating
founder population size using microsatellite data in
such a recently founded population?
second, is there a program in the public domain that
can handle a simulation such as that described above?
It is presumably relatively easy to write such a program,
unfortunately it is not my expertise!
Many thanks for your anticipated help on this problem,54 EvolDir May 1, 2008

used this program to estimate the number of founders
in non-native populations of bulllfrogs in Europe (Fice-

Genetic data simulation answers
Dear all
Many thanks to all that replied to my request for a
simulation software for genetic data.
Many people asked to have a copy of the answers. Be-
low there is my original question and all the replies.
Thank you again to all.
My question:
I’m looking for a simulation software for genetic data
that allows:
- input genotpypic data - perform random mating sim-
ulation for several generations
Easypop doesn’t allow to input data ﬁle. I’m greateful
to all for any help.May 1, 2008 EvolDir 55
REPLIES:
Hi Daniele,
You could try Nemo. A friend of mine built it and I
have been using it extensively. There is functionality
built into Nemo to read from an input ﬁle and to per-
form random mating simulations, but I am not sure
how easy it is to construct an input ﬁle from scratch
with your own data. I’ve copied Fred’s email here, as
he programmed it originally, so you might ask him.
Good luck! Sam
http://nemo2.sourceforge.net/ http://-
sourceforge.net/projects/nemo2/ Hi Daniele,
it sounds like BOTTLESIM could be what you are
looking for. It does however not model migration
or mutation, only drift: http://chkuo.name/software/-
BottleSim.html Cheers, Frank
Dear Daniele,
The software HybridLab from Nielsen can do this and
uses a genepop input ﬁle. Although initially devloped
for hybridisation simulations, when using twice the
same population, it creates random mating within this
population. It is however not automated to run for sev-
eral generations, requiring a script or manual uploading
of the result ﬁle as input for every generation.
If would be happy to get the other responses you get
on this topic.
buona fortuna !
ciao
Greg

HeylabSoftware.htm#FPG Dear Daniele. Regarding
your question at EvolDir: HYBRIDLAB might do thetrick, except I’m not sure that it automatically can
simulate over several generation. You may have to do
a separate run for each generation and then use the
output ﬁle from the previous simulated generation.
Anyway, I’ve attached two references, so you can check
them out Good luck Morten Allentoft
Finally, I add to the list ManagedPop (Written by Ken-
neth Birnbaum, Charles M. Peters, Philip N. Benfey,
and Rob DeSalle). It is a drift simulation that projects
loss of allelic diversity in populations with overlapping
generations that receive an input of progeny from a
small (in terms of genetic identity) second population.

Hypervariable mitochondrial region
Dear Evoldir members, Some one can help me with my
problem: I work with a limpet species (Gastropoda)
and I have been trying some mitochondrial genes (16S,
Cyt B, COI) for a phylogeographic study obtaining low

Does anyone of you know any region of these character-
istics in Gastropods or any Mollusca (and the primers
to amplify it)? Thank you very much

Hypervariable mitochondrial region
answers
Dear Evoldir members, Sorry for the delay to post the
answers I got for a hypervariable mitochondrial region
to amplify in Gastropods or any Mollusca. Unfortu-
nately I didnt receive good news, apparently gastropod
mt genome doesn’t have a HVR or even very many in-
tergenic spaces. here are some of the main answers I
received. Thank you all.
I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news for you. I’ve wished
many times that my land snails had a hyper variable re-
gion so I could get some better resolution in the shallow
regions of my phylogeny. Sadly it seems the gastropod
mt genome doesn’t have a HVR or even very many in-
tergenic spaces, attached is a review that cites all the
whole mt genome sequences published for molluscs if
you want to check it out for yourself.
You may not ﬁnd enough variation in the mitochondrialDNA. Many inverts have slower evolutionary rates for
mtDNA nearly equal to their nuclear genome. This was
the case in some California limpets that I helped a stu-
dent with. You also may be looking at relatively recent
divergence among the populations, as well.
In the group of the pulmonates I’ve looked for exactly
the same as you: hypervariable loci on the mitochon-
drion. Alas, it did not work for me either. I’ve also
checked CO1 and 16S. However, SNPs seem to be much
more abundant on CO1 than on 16S, and enzymatic di-
gestion may give lots of variation. In addition, in many
groups there is this hypervariable region on the mito-
chondrion called the d-loop.

Meiosis and genetic repair
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
i wanted to let you know about some remarkable ev-
idence proving that meiosis delivers a unique form of
genetic repair which rejuvenates drastically cells that
have “aged” because of previous mitotic divisions. Your
feedback is most welcome and ideas for collaborations
very encouraged.
nobody knows for which purpose eukaryotic cells some-
times go through meiosis rather than mitosis. on the
contrary, mutation biologists have known since the
1960s that meiosis in yeast and several other organ-
isms is ~20-40x more mutagenic than mitosis, and re-
cent work shows that hundreds of DSBs are generated
during meiosis by the spo11 protein. meiosis therefore
appears to be quite disadvantageous relative to mitosis
(but assertions about meiosis entailing little or no cost
appear regularly in the evolutionary-biology literature).
DNA repair has often been proposed as a main ad-
vantage of sexual reproduction, but all known types of
DNA repair, including recombination repair, can occur
without meiosis (e.g., during the extended G2 phase of
“haploid yeast”).
a couple of years ago, for a variety of reasons of no inter-
est here, i came to the conclusion that meiosis must be
highly adaptive and allow a form of DNA repair to take
place that is unavailable to mitotically growing cells.
serendipitously, last fall I found spectacular conﬁrma-tion for my ideas in laura hoopes’ pomona college web-
site where she describes how meiosis rejuvenated very
markedly yeast “mother” cells which had accumulated
genetic damage during previous budding events (and
she states that spo11 is required!). the evidence is de-
scribed in the 4th-last paragraph of
http://pages.pomona.edu/˜llh04747/yeastage.html ; a
pdf generated by me of this web page is available upon
request.
similarly spectacular meiotic rejuvenation has also been
documented for paramecium. please google “Macieira-
Coelho meiosis transplantation Aufderheide” and fol-
low the citations there.
remarkably, even paramecium’s endogamy cycle deliv-
ers a strong rejuvenation: in absence of conjugation
partners, an old paramecium exhausted by previous
asexual divisions can rejuvenate itself by letting its
micronucleus undergo meiosis and then using two of
the resulting haploid nuclei to generate a new rejuve-
nated diploid micronucleus (with the other two being
destroyed). this endomeiosis+synkary process does not
involve any cell divisions or cell fusions and old parame-
cia die fully dysfunctional if both this process and con-
jugation are blocked experimentally.
furthermore, forestry people have known for ages that
they cannot reproduce trees asexually forever and that
at a certain point they have to use meiosis to reset the
aging clock.
last but not least, even reduced-genome specialists like
giardia and microsporidia have kept the spo11 gene !
meiotic rejuvenation appears therefore to be universal
and i believe it’s a safe bet to assume that this reju-
venation is meiosis’ raison d’etre. this huge advantage
of meiosis should “solve” the questions about the ori-
gin and maintenance of meiosis (but not of outcrossing)
as well as the question of the “maintenance of males”
whenever mitotic asexuality is the “asexual” alterna-
tive.
as you can imagine, dear and reputable members,
conﬁrming and expanding the above observations –
especially at the molecular level by characterizing bio-
chemically the damage– not only is biology of the deep-
est kind but is also likely to lead to preventive and ther-
apeutic biomedicine of immense importance.
indeed, it is very likely that the special kind of disabling
genetic damage that eukaryotic cells accumulate as they
divide asexually –and that is repaired so eﬀectively by
meiosis-will turn out to be reversible by artiﬁcial means
without the help of meiosis.
in principle, one should be able to subject young and old58 EvolDir May 1, 2008
micronuclei and yeast nuclei to progressive preparative
biochemical stripping, throw the extracts obtained after
various steps of preparation at an HPLC and other au-
tomated analytico-chemical techniques, and then con-
trast the obtained compound spectra of young and old
nuclei, etc.
unfortunately, my initial consultations indicate that en-
riching for the damage will not be easy, but perhaps one
could engineer the enzymes likely to be directly involved
in this unique form of repair (spo11, rev3; see below)
so they become glued covalently to their substrates and
the complexes can then be isolated with speciﬁc anti-
bodies.
importantly, even if whole-body rejuvenation treat-
ments will turn out to be toxic, one could still repair
stem cells outside the body and then inject the cells
back into appropriate organs, etc.

Molluskan DNA extraction answers
Dear all,
As some of you requested, here are the replies I re-
ceived (even the ones written in portuguese). I did a
copy-paste on the answers but in case you need any
further information, feel free to contact me.
Once again, thank you for all the information and hope
it helps for those (also) in need!
Best regards, Carla Pereira
Hi,
I just read your thread on Evoldir. I sometimes had
problems amplifying any sort of marker from my DNA
preps (nothing molluscan though), even when they con-
tained ample amounts of DNA. I found that an RNA
digest of the DNA extractions got rid of that problem.
Somehow RNA fragments seemed to interfere with my
PCRs. Not sure if you do an RNAse digest with your
extractions anyway, but if not that might be worth a
shot.

hello, you might’ve tried this already, but, i’ve ex-
tracted RNA from mussels and found that doing a
lithium chloride re-precipitation (after you’ve extracted
the DNA fully and resuspended do another precipita-
tion). The protocol is in Molecular systematics (hillis,
moritz, and mable) in the rna/dna extraction chap-

Hi,
We have been working on a few molluscan species in
our lab - mostly squid and abalone. Generally we have
fouund the Qiagen DNEasy kits to work pretty well for
DNA extractions for these species. However, you did
not mention how your tissue was preserved, or how old
the specimens were. One thing we have found is that
samples more than a couple of years old can be a bit hit
and miss, especially if they’ve been stored in less than
perfect condiditon. Basically, the fresher the sample,
the better the chance of successful DNA extraction and
PCR ampliﬁcation. I think generally, from my experi-
ence, alcohol preservation works better than freezing for
molluscs and other species that have high mucopolysac-
charides.
You also havent mentioned what primers/approach you
were using for the PCR. Again we have found that
most “universal” primers are unreliable for molluscs
and that it is pretty important to develop species-
speciﬁc primers. If you have managed to get at least
some individuals to PCR and sequence, then check how
well your primers match, it may be that there has been
a small change in the primer-binding site that is caus-
ing your problem and it might be a good idea to try to
design new primers.
I hope this helps

Hi,
I have recently worked with a number of marine organ-
isms, including molluscs, crustaceans, ﬁsh and ascidi-
ans, and I generally ﬁnd that the molluscs and ﬁsh are
among the easiest to work with (I worked with snails
of the genera Siphonaria and Nassarius, as well as the
mussel Perna perna). You lack of success may be due
to a number of other factors, e.g. the tissue you areMay 1, 2008 EvolDir 59
targeting is not ideal (I usually cut oﬀ a very small
piece from the foot of the snails), you are using too
much tissue, the samples were not preserved well (fre-
quent freezing and thawing degrades DNA, have you
tried fresh tissue?) or the primers you are using are
not working for all your species. I have found that if
it’s mtDNA you’re after, Folmer’s COI primers usually
work well (Folmer et al. 1994), and Palumbi’s (1991)
16Sar and 16Sbr combination is also reliable. But I
have just found a Siphonaria species for which the COI
primers do not work, and have used a diﬀerent design
for that. If you’re suspecting that the primers are the
problem, I suggest you get both of these and if one
works and the other doesn’t, you know where the prob-
lem is.
Hope this helps and best of luck, Peter

MPval.exe software for calculating the Garza &
Williamson M-Ratio for population bottleneck.
Here is a summary of the many replies i got:
- this software runs under Mac OS 9 or any classic com-
patible machine. (not the new intel processors!)
- the ﬁle format is described by the authors under this
link: http://137.110.142.7/uploadedFiles/Divisions/-
FED/Staﬀ Pages/Carlos Garza/ratioin.txt (i followed
the example above and used Genealex to get the infor-

extension as suggested by some.)
- i had my input ﬁle in the same folder as the
MPval.exe ﬁle and the software ran smoothly!
Thanks to all those that helped out. I hope this will be
helpful to others!

PCR Smears
Hi All,
I am a second year graduate student working on Phy-
logeny of Hemidactylus geckos of India.
This is about the PCRs.
For the past few months, I have been getting smears
(without bands) in Cyt B primer set. The major issue
here is that from the very beginning, the samples had
been yielding good results with cyt B primers...I should
say that they were behaving themselves. Since Decem-
ber 20th,2007, I have been getting this strange result of
only smears without bands in the PCRs of cytB. The
smears are showing up in negative as well.
We have run all the troubleshoots including ordering
new primers twice. but alas...no progress. At least now
we are not getting smears...but no bands as well. We
even designed new set of primers for cytB but we are
not getting any bands with them as well.
DNA of the samples is not a problem because it has
been yielding bright and crisp bands with the other
primers.
Can you suggets some solution to this problem.
Thanks and regards Rohini Bansal

SeqEdit software
Dear Evoldir-ers, I am looking for a free software for PC
to edit sequences. I am looking for a software that will
give me the option to view the sequence (ABI ﬁles), cut
oﬀ (manually) the primer sequence and other “junk”,
edit single nucleotides (e.g., SNPs or heterozygotes),
and export the edited sequence in FASTA format (or
at least text ﬁle) for alignment in other software. I used
the demo version of CodonCode Aligner, but it doesn’t
allow to export the edited sequence, and their prices
are way above my (zero) budget. Any recommenda-
tions are welcomed. Thanks Yuval

BioEdit.html comments: “I am sure you must have re-
ceived this suggestion a million times - make it 10E6+1
now :)... ”; “excellent”; “I have used it for 8 years,
works perfectly well for what you need it for, although
there are some small glitches (it is free after all), but
nothing you can’t get used to”; “The only drawback
is that it doesn’t allow you to compare several chro-
matograms in a single window as CodonCode does”;
“you can view the chromatogram, take of the ends of
the sequences and make many manual changes. It also
does sequence alignment and contig formation.”;

ware, veeeeeeeeery basic, but works well”.
3. Mega (10) http://www.megasoftware.net/ com-
ments: “That’s easy: Use MEGA ;-) ”; “My favorite”;
“The program MEGA is free, and the latest version has
a sequence viewer, alignment editor, as well as build-

you can do them individually ”
4. Vector NTI (6) https://commerce.invitrogen.com/-
index.cfm?fuseaction=userGroup.home >From Invitro-
gen - free for academics. Their site was down, so I
didn’t check the validity of the link. comments: “a
modular program within which the ContiExpress mod-
ule would allow you to preform the tasks you describe.”;
“As an academic researcher, you can get a free licence
of Vector NTI owned by Invitrogen. I use it the same
way as that you are looking for: view chromatograms,
edit sequences, do the contigs etc.”; “gives a free one-
year licence (details on their website), which can then
be renewed after that for subsequent year-long periods
(always free unless you are using it for commercial pur-
poses)... I ﬁnd it very similar to Sequencher (which
is very user-friendly but expensive) and it didn’t take
me much playing around to sort out all the functions.
There are also many other programmes in the Vector
NTI programme that you may ﬁnd of use, for example,
you can design primers and order them from Invitrogen
from within the programme. You can import a variety
of ﬁles including ABI, and can export in FASTA formatfrom ContigExpress. ”
5. FinchTV (4) http://www.geospiza.com/ﬁnchtv/-
comments: “you can use Finch TV (which is also free
but only can show you one chromatogram at a time)
which is a nice little program to edit chromatograms
you can search for primer sequnces cut them oﬀ.... you
can also easily make and see the reverse complement
sequences... I use Finch TV ﬁrst to check my chro-
matograms, make reverse complement sequences, cut
oﬀ primers, correct some basees... then I save the ﬁles
as FASTA and open them in Bioedit. In Bioedit you
can make alignments.....”
6. Geneious (3) http://www.geneious.com comments:
“The free version has a 2 week demonstration of the
pro version. It does a lot more besides edit sequences.”
7. Staden (3) http://staden.sourceforge.net/ com-
ments: “It has nice features such as showing the conﬁ-
dence of base calls and consensus sequences, it can show
chromatograms when editing, it’s open source, and it’s
completely free. It’s not as user friendly as some of the
commercial packages, though.”; “It is great, free and for
PCs. It should be able to do all the below tasks (you
might have to read through the manual a few times
though...)”
8. ProSeq (2) http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/-
institutes/evolution/software/ﬁlatov/proseq.htm com-

Sequencing problems
Dear Colleagues,
Our sequencing has gone belly up and 3 months of ex-
tensive testing has not resolved the problem, maybe
someone else in the evoldir community has had this64 EvolDir May 1, 2008
particular problem before and might know the answer!
Any help will be much appreciated!!!
THE PROBLEM: We are sequencing PCR products of
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) extracted from plasma (Roche
Viral DNA extraction kit). In the past (for several
years) we got nice sequences, up to 1000 bases under
extremely good conditions. Now we are getting barely
500 bases with a ﬂuorescence signal that is incredibly
high in the beginning and then abruptly drops after ~
150 bases to become very low. It is sometimes read-
able in Lasergene software and on Finch TV but really
diﬃcult to read in Sequence Navigator. The sequence
is correct when compared to other HBV reference se-
quences.
We check the gel puriﬁed PCR products on a gel as
well as by Nanodrop. On the gel the bands look ﬁne
but the Nanodrop suggest that we have signiﬁcant con-
tamination of our DNA, i.e. lower concentrations than
expected from gel, bad ratios (high or low) and very
dirty curves. I am starting to forget what a clean curve
is support to look like!
We have TESTED the following PARAMETERS: op-
erator (4 people) plasma sample (genotype, geographi-
cal region, even same sample but extracted at diﬀerent
times) ampliﬁed region (3200kb full genome or smaller
fragments down to 300 bases) primer (we use about 15
primers through the whole genome) polymerase (Roche
HiFi or ABi AmpliTaq) gel extraction kit (we used Qi-
agen, Omega and Macherey-Nagel) agarose water (we
used HPLC puriﬁed water only as a test to compare to
MilliPore) DNA concentration ABi sequencing kit lot
sequencer (we have ABi 3100 in House and also send
sample oﬀ to a large scale sequencing facility which have
3730xl; when we send samples oﬀ we only send puri-
ﬁed PCR product and primer, they add the sequencing
chemistry.) Organism (we also have a problem with a
small batch of HIV samples that we tried to process)
As you would suggest, we have replaced all reagents -
without success.
Here are a few more ODDITIES: All samples that have
been gel extracted and puriﬁed before Dec 07 still work!
Anything that has been PCR’ed since Dec 07 fails. We
sequenced some old puriﬁed products after re-PCR and
column puriﬁcation with and without the gel extraction
step and they also didn’t sequence properly. Sequencing
of old and fresh PCR products: old products give iden-
tical traces to original sequencing run and new products
fail. Sequencing of HBV plasmids works as does ABi’s
control plasmid.
NB: We have had a pipette clinic in the lab in the ﬁrst
week of December after which the problems started -however, we use these pipettes to set up sequencing re-
actions with old product which still works. And we use
brand new pipettes in the PCR room, so these have not
been serviced in December.
FUTURE TESTS planned: Do the whole procedure in
another lab. Give DNA and primers to someone else
in another lab. Contact ABi again and ﬁnd out if they
have changed the chemistry without publicizing it. We
have gone through their whole troubleshooting proto-
col but as many of you know, it is not easy to get high
quality answers from ABi... Run some plasmid onto a
gel, extract and sequence.
We believe that the problem lies somewhere in the gel
extraction step but as we are using primers that am-
plify 8 genotypes we tend to have unspeciﬁc band and
cannot avoid this step.
Any recommendation would be much appreciated and
I will compile an answer email once I have had your
responses. We are prepared to try anything - voodoo,
rain dances, the PCR song...!

Software BIMr
Dear Evoldir members,
We would like to inform you that we have released a
new program for the estimation of recent migration
rates. BIMr is a free software that makes inferences
about recent proportions of immigrant genes in subdi-
vided populations and that can identify the environ-
mental factors that are responsible of observed gene
ﬂow patterns. BIMr is distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) and is avail-
able for all three major platorms from the following
website: http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm

Software FastTree
We are pleased to announce the initial release of Fast-
Tree, a tool for inferring neighbor joining trees from
large alignments. FastTree is capable of computing
trees for tens to hundreds of thousands of protein or
nucleotide sequences on most desktop computers.
FastTree uses: *proﬁles instead of a distance matrix
to reduce memory usage *linear distances with a char-
acter dissimilarity matrix *a new “top hit” heuristic to
achieve a sub N-squared run time *local support instead
of bootstrap for node support values
FastTree is faster than computing a distance matrix,
and up to 10,000 times faster than neighbor joining with
bootstrap. FastTree is about as accurate as BIONJ
with log corrected distances for well-supported nodes.
To download source code, binaries, or a preprint, please
visit:
http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/ Abstract
Background: A fundamental goal of molecular evolu-
tion is to infer the evolutionary history the phylogeny
of sequences from their alignment. Neighbor joining,
which is a standard method for inferring large phyloge-
nies, takes as its input the distances between all pairs
of sequences. The distance matrix requires O(N ^2 L)
time to compute and O(N ^2) memory to store, where
N is the number of sequences and L is the width of
the alignment. As some families already contain over
100,000 sequences, these time and space requirements
are prohibitive.
Results: We show that neighbor-joining can be imple-
mented in O(NLa) space, where ’a’ is the size of the
alphabet, by storing proﬁles of internal nodes in the
tree instead of storing a distance matrix. Proﬁle based
neighbor joining allows weighted joins, as in BIONJ,
but requires that distances be linear. With heuris-
tic search, neighbor joining with proﬁles takes only
O(N*SQRT(N) log(N)La) time. We estimate the con-
ﬁdence of each split (A,B) vs. (C,D) from the proﬁles
of A, B, C, and D, without bootstrapping. Our imple-mentation, FastTree, has similar accuracy as traditional
neighbor joining. FastTree constructed trees, including
support values, for biological alignments with 39,092
or 167,547 distinct sequences in less time than it takes
to compute the distance matrix and in a fraction of the
space. Traditional neighbor joining with 100 bootstraps
would be 10,000 times slower.
Conclusions: Neighbor joining with proﬁles makes it
possible to construct phylogenies for the largest se-
quence families and to estimate their reliability.

Software multiGUI beta release
Dear EvolDir members
Myself, Federico Hoﬀmann and Juan Opazo are proud
to release the ﬁrst beta version of multiGUI. This pro-
gram is our ﬁrst attempt to make a graphical inter-
face for multidivtime and its related programs. mul-
tiGUI simplify the procedure of running multidivtime,
baseml, paml2modelinf and estbNew, by employing a
user-friendly interface created with Python and wx-
Python. Although multiGUI is cross-platform, the cur-
rent release is restricted to Windows XP and Vista. In
the near future Linux and OS X versions will be also
available.
At the moment we are intending to release multiGUI
as a restricted beta for 20 users, to measure interest,
deﬁne future strategies in the development, and track
bugs that weren’t caught previously. So for everyone
interested in multiGUI, please send a message to
multigui@genedrift.org
with your name and the desired system, XP, Vista,
Linux or OS X.
We will deﬁne a group of 20 (or more, or less, depend-
ing on interest) beta-users that will receive a link to
download an installation package.

Software TREEFINDER
A new unpaid TREEFINDER version is online at:
www.treeﬁnder.de TREEFINDER is a software to
compute phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.
New features are:
- computation of pairwise ML distances - construction
of distance trees: NJ, BIONJ - least squares ﬁtting of
edge lengths - more DNA models: J1, J2, J3 (= TIM),
TVM - more protein models: betHIV and witHIV -
improved model proposer - more eﬃcient TL
Distance trees can be built under topological con-
straints.
The models J1...J3 represent the 3 possibilities of join-
ing two and two transversion parameters of the GTR.
They have 3 free rate parameters and, together with
the TVM, they ﬁll the gap in complexity between the
TN and the GTR. The model proposer proposes the
new models if they are appropriate.
The TL interpreter is now three times faster and uses
half the memory of the previous implementation.
Please note that I am still not being paid for my work
and that I had no income for years. I wonder if some-
body ﬁnds TREEFINDER worth oﬀering me a com-
pensation, a wage, a position, a perspective.

SouthAfrica Volunteers
SmallMammalEvolution
Volunteer needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Evolution of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working conditions
will await applicants, as the study species gets up
with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and stopsMay 1, 2008 EvolDir 67
its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld
will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
750 (around 65 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
170 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 250 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).

SYBR Safe DNA gel stain answers
Sincere thanks to everyone who responded to my query.
What a great resource we have in evoldir! I have com-
piled the responses to date below. Each paragraph is
a unique response. The consensus in the community
is that the vast majority of people who are using the
SABR SAFE system have been very pleased with the
results. Many recommend incorporation directly into
the gel. All noted that it is more expensive than us-
ing ethidium bromide, plus a new camera ﬁlter needs
to be purchased, but some savings are re-captured by
the fact that the gels do not have to be disposed of as
hazardous waste (but some labs do so anyway, just to
be sure). Most noted the light sensitivity of this stain.
One lab manager directed me to her blog which raises
the issue of whether ethidium bromide is really all that
hazardous ( http://rrresearch.blogspot.com/2006/10/-
heresy-about-ethidium-bromide.html ). It does not
work well or at all with RNA. Finally, a couple of labs
are using GEL RED, another alternative, with good
results.
Alan
————- Responses ——————-
Yes, I made the transition in my old lab. I found it
great in a number of ways - in particular I found it to
be more sensitive - I could see bands that were not ob-servable using EtBr. Indeed, bands that you cannot see
by eye also became apparent once viewed through the
special camera-lense ﬁlter required. Which brings me
to the bad points - you need to ﬁrst buy a new lense
ﬁlter as recommended, which is not cheap. And over-
all its more expensive than EtBr. But if you have the
money I would recommend it - I never regretted the
switch.
We switched our laboratory over to Invitrogen’s sybr-
safe a year or two back. There are a couple of things
probably worth noting. Firstly, it’s a heap more light
sensitive than EtBr so you can’t pre-add the dye to
agarose and store on the shelf for a while. This is not
a big deal, it just means adding it fresh each time (or
storing post stain solution away from light). I think the
biggest thing is that it optimally ﬂuoresces at a diﬀer-
ent wavelength from EtBr. We use a BioRad geldoc for
visualisation and were originally using the same camera
ﬁlter as for EtBr. This meant that the bands, although
“see-able” were much fainter than with EtBr (and rea-
sonably often, when bands on a gel were weak, we put
it in EtBr for a while to get a decent view). Since
then, we have purchased a diﬀerent ﬁlter for Sybr and
it’s now a heap better, and I’d say every bit as good
as EtBr. I’m totally happy with it, and even though
it’s a bit pricier than EtBr, I think it’s worth it, and
would totally recommend it (as long as you get a sybr
ﬁlter for your camera). As an aside, Invitrogen market
Sybr Safe as a totally “safe” alternative but I can’t help
but wonder if something that binds DNA can really be
totally safe...
i have been using the SYBR Safe since i moved to UBC
six months ago. We use it to test PCR ampliﬁcations
generally with 1.5 - 2 % agarose gel. The results are
totally satisfactory with the recommended dosage (e.g.
9ul for 90ml gel). I guess it depends on what applica-
tion you want to make of it, i heard some people still
used ETBR as they found it more sensitive for other
applications.
we have been routinely using SYBR Safe for around 2
yrs now, and recommend it entirely... if you have ’very
little’ product though it may not be satisfactory, but in
routine lab gels it should be an entirely useful replace-
ment for ethidium bromide.
Yes. My experience with SYBR Safe is entirely posi-
tive. It is more sensitive to timing your lab work than
EtBr, i.e. the gel with SYBR Safe cannot be prepared
long in advance and subsequently should be covered to
prevent light exposition, but I was satisﬁed with it.
We’ve been using SYBR Safe for a while now. We also
bought Invitrogen’s blue transilluminator to avoid us-
ing UV. Except of the price I think it is a good EtBrMay 1, 2008 EvolDir 69
substitute. One thing though, it doesn’t work with
RNA, so we also kept the EtBr/UV facility.
We have indeed tried out this stain as an alternative to
Ethidium bromide and it works reasonably well. One
drawback is that it is sensitive to light and once the
stain is made up it does not last that long ( <1 week).
We have found a much better alternative called Gel Red
nucleic acid stain which we buy from Jomar Diagnos-
tics (your distributor may be diﬀerent). This stain can
be added to the gel prior to pouring and will survive
repeated microwaving and cooling cycles. It is also not
light sensitive, can be stored at room temp and seems
to last for many weeks without any loss of signal. I
would recommend it over SYBR safe. Hope this info
helps.
I’m currently working in a large genetics lab and we
use SYBR DNA gel stain for all gels. Each aliquot of
SYBR and TBE buﬀer can be re-used for up to 4 gels,
and, on average, my gels look as good as they would
with ethidium bromide.

UtrechtU Herbarium closure
Dear Friends,
Sorry for cross-posting, but I’d like to bring the follow-
ing to your attention.
On 26th March 2008 the University Board of Utrecht
University, The Netherlands, informed the employees
of the Utrecht Herbarium that as of 1 June 2008 the
Herbarium is to be closed and, with immediate eﬀect,
access to the collections, from national as well as inter-
national workers, is to cease. This must not be allowed!
*Closure of the Herbarium is a disaster for current na-
tional and international research!
*Closure of the Herbarium is a disaster for any future
research!
*Closure of the Herbarium contradicts the Biodiversity
Covenant signed by the Netherlands which ensures the
accessibility of data relating to biodiversity (either un-
der Dutch ownership or under Dutch guardianship)!*Closure of the Herbarium is a disaster for all the
botanical and ecological research taking place in South
America, especially Suriname, Guyana, French Guyana
and the Amazonian basin.
*Closure of the Herbarium is in eﬀect a denial of the
cultural- historical value of this Herbarium to The
Netherlands and Suriname!
*Closure of the Herbarium is the start of scientiﬁc de-
terioration and wrecks the near-ﬁnalized plans for the
creation of one Dutch Centre for Biodiversity [NCB].
What can you do?

WebSiteTools survey query
Dear Population Genetics/Genomics friends and col-
leagues,
We are polling the population genetics/genomics com-
munity for your interest in a suite of tools that would
allow reasonably quick development of a web portal for
dissemination of population genomics data sets. We are
aware of several sites for diﬀerent study species (e.g.
maize, rice, arabidopsis) for dissemination of medium
to large size data sets on molecular population genetic
nucleotide sequence variation. These sites usually in-
clude some or all of the following items:1) DNA se-
quences for a panel of individual for hundreds to thou-
sands of genes, 2) SNP genotypes for the same or a
larger number of individuals, 3) geographical maps of
the locations of samples individuals, 4) linkage maps of
genes or SNPs, and other functionalities. Setting up a
site such as this can require years of programmer time,
however with simpliﬁed development tools the time re-
quired to set up such a site could be reduced to a few
weeks. Moreover, a web portal development tool would70 EvolDir May 1, 2008
allow the same template to be implemented for various
diﬀerent studies, thus users would not have to re-learn
the environment with each new data set.
We have two main questions for you:
1) Do you know of any Population Genomics Web Por-
tal Development Toolkit that is currently under con-
struction?
If not, 2) Do you see a need for a Population GenomicsWeb Portal Development Toolkit? (if there is no other,
we are considering development of one)
Thank you for your help and input.
Sincerely ,

Consumers our decisions to buy fruit are driven by our
beliefs that the fruit will taste good and be good for
us. However, foods do not taste the same to every-
one. We aim to understand more about the variation
in the perception of taste among consumers by study-
ing diﬀerences in ability to detect aroma compounds
and associated diﬀerences in genes encoding odorant
receptors.
The research, which involves the use of sensory tri-
als and genetic assays (SNP, odorant receptor gene se-
quencing), forms the basis of a three year ﬁxed term
postdoctoral position for a PhD graduate in molecular
population genetics and an interest in sensory science.
Familiarity with the design and analysis of association
testing and molecular population genetic studies would
be of beneﬁt, as would experience in the high through-
put collection and analysis of molecular variation data
from SNPs to gene sequencing information.

BeltsvilleMaryland
HoneyBeePopulationGenetics
A Postdoctoral Research Associate position is available
in Beltsville, Maryland, to study relationships between
honey bees and their pathogens. The focus will be on
genetic traits that aﬀect pathogen virulence and the
abilities of bees to mount an eﬀective immune response.
Two systems are under study: a larval bacterial disease
(American foulbrood, caused by the gram-positive bac-
terium Paenibacillus larvae) and a disease of adult bees
caused by the microsporidial parasite Nosema ceranae.
The project will combine population-genetic ap-
proaches, expression analyses, and controlled breed-
ing experiments to answer evolutionary and applied
questions related to variation across bee lineages in
disease susceptibility, and the mechanisms by which
pathogens invade bees. Draft genome sequences for
bees and both of these organisms are available, and
speciﬁc strategies in use here include genome annota-
tion, gene-candidate validation using microarrays and
qPCR, high-throughput sequencing/resequencing, and
comparative genomics across insects. Depending on in-
terests and expertise, alternate projects could focus on
environmental factors important for disease, and the
implications of social interactions on disease transmis-
sion.
Skill in computational biology, including genome anno-
tation, would be extremely useful, as well as laboratory
skills in gene expression and marker analysis. A back-
ground in studying social insects, host/pathogen inter-
actions, or insect immune systems would be fantastic.72 EvolDir May 1, 2008

15 MONTH RESEARCH POSITION IN MONTPEL-
LIER (FRANCE)
Centre d’Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive - CNRS
Population genetics of ectomycorrhizal fungi
Fields of interest of our team: we focus on ectomycor-
rhizal fungi in temperate ecosystems. We are interested
in plants that rely on the carbon provided by their myc-
orrhizal fungi (mixotrophy, mycoheterotrophy), impact
of global change on ectomycorrhizal communities, and
population genetics of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We are
interested in the structure of these populations (gene
ﬂow, mating) and factors explaining their diversity,
such as geographic distance, host species, and local soil
conditions.
The present research position is funded by CNRS,
and the European Evoltree program ( http://-
www.evoltree.org/ ) will contribute to experimental
expenses.
Working project in which the associated researcher
would be involved: We have completed the genome se-
quencing of Laccaria bicolor, a model species for ec-
tomycorrhizal symbiosis, and Tuber melanosporum, a
prized edible species. The sequencing was performed
under supervision of a joint team (Francis Martin,
INRA Nancy) that is also involved in this project. The
sequence data provide useful tools to design microsatel-
lites and to identify genes under selection in ectomyc-
orrhizal fungal populations. The applicant is free to
choose his favourite model, and will be involved in the
supervision of a PhD student on the other model.
For these two species, we aim at obtaining neutral
markers (microsatellites) and describing population
structure over Europe (+ America for L. bicolor). Here,
the available genomes allow us to prepare an optimal
marker set to analyse populations of fruiting body and
ectomycorrhizae, their diﬀerentiation by distance (gene
ﬂow over Europe at least) and reproduction by al-
logamy versus autogamy (linkage disequilibrium). We
will also search for ﬁngerprints of species-level selection
among candidate genes (involved in soil exploitation,
symbiosis, or in sexuality), considering related species
as outgroups. We will investigate balance of synonym
versus non-synonym substitutions, and, at the popu-May 1, 2008 EvolDir 73
lation level, compare the geographic structure of poly-
morphism (if any) with that obtained for neutral mark-
ers.
Our team is part of larger a team focusing on co-
evolution and population genetics in several models,
including orchids, plants (especially domesticated), ﬁgs
and their pollinators, ants and plants. We are part
of the Centre d’Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive (ca
150 researchers on ecology and evolution). Montpellier
is near the Mediterranean Sea, in a scientiﬁcally rich
environment for plant and fungal sciences, evolution-
ary ecology and especially population genetics.
Our team contributes to the organization of a
New Phytologist meeting in Montpellier, in De-
cember 2008 ( http://www.newphytologist.org/ myc-
orrhizal/default.htm) on ecology of ectomycorrhizal
fungi.
Requested experience: applicants should not have the
French nationality. They should be experienced (as
demonstrated by published papers) in at least three of
the following areas:
1 - population genetics
2 - genomic sciences
3 - microsatellites & molecular ecology
4 - fungal ecology
5 - evolutionary genetics
Duration: 15 months, starting in Aug. / Sept.
2008. Salary ranges from 2 020 euro/month to 2 762
euro/month (level: associate researcher), depending on
applicant’s experience and diploma.

Moulis France DisperalEvolution
POSITION AS POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH
FELLOW for 2 YEARS in DISPERSAL EVOLUTION
available at the Experimental Evolution Station of the
CNRS in Moulis (Station dEcologie Exp´ erimentale du
CNRS ` a Moulis, France)
The position starts at the 1st of November 2008.
The highly motivated candidate will study the role of
condition-dependent dispersal in meta-population dy-
namics and evolution. He/She will conduct experi-
ments in a vast system of semi-natural interconnected
enclosures. The extent of the system and the equipment
of each enclosure to record movements and environmen-
tal conditions are unique in Europe and oﬀer excellent
possibilities for dispersal research. As a model organ-
ism the Common Lizard is foreseen. Depending on the
candidates skills and interests, the research could also
incorporate a theoretical part about the role of informa-
tion in dispersal evolution, metapopulation dynamics
and invasion. This theoretical work can be developed
in the context of species responses to climate change.
The Station dEcologie Experimentale in Moulis
(SEEM) is a recently founded research and service unit
of the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientiﬁque
(CNRS). SEEM, where the candidate will be work-
ing, is an interdisciplinary research group that com-
bines the skills of population evolutionists, behavioural
evolutionists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists to
study animal dispersal and any aspect of it. SEEM has
a strong international ﬂavour due its international staﬀ
and cooperation with institutes in the US and several
European countries. SEEM is located in the foothills
of the Pyrenean region Ariege (France). The station is
currently undergoing extensive renovation and will soon
host well equipped laboratories, comprising physiologic,
genetic, and evolutionary lab facilities as well as exper-
imental sites (Aviaries, a green house, metapopulation
cage among others).
The successful candidate is required to hold a PhD or
equivalent experience in a relevant area.
Applicants should submit a letter of application de-
scribing their scientiﬁc experience and interests with
emphasis on how they expect to contribute to the
project, curriculum vitae including a list of published

Postdoctoral Researcher
?Evolutionary diversiﬁcation in an endangered biodi-
versity hotspot: the Southeast Asian peat swamp forest
ﬁsh fauna?
We seek a highly motivated and productive postdoc-
toral researcher to work on a 3-year NERC-funded
research project on the evolutionary history of the
peat swamp forest (PSF) ichthyofauna. The Southeast
Asian peat swamp forests, found in the Sundaland bio-
diversity hotspot, are waterlogged forests that grow on
a layer of dead plant material. PSF are characterized
by a unique, vastly stenotopic freshwater ﬁsh commu-
nity, which is adapted to highly acidic black waters and
comprises several miniature taxa and narrow range en-
demics, many of which have only been discovered in
recent years.
The successful candidate will use a multigene, molec-
ular systematic approach to provide a robust phylo-
genetic framework of representative peat swamp forest
ﬁsh clades, integrating relaxed molecular clock method-
ology and statistical phylogeography with geological
and paleoclimatological data, in order to (1) recon-
struct the time frame for the peat swamp forest ﬁsh di-
versiﬁcation, (2) identify past demographic expansions
and their taxonomic, geographic and temporal corre-
lates, and (3) identify regions of elevated taxonomic
and genetic diversity that contribute most to the evo-
lutionary legacy of this unique ecosystem.76 EvolDir May 1, 2008
Applicants should have a PhD in molecular phylogenet-
ics or related ﬁelds as well as a broad interest in sys-
tematics and evolution. They should be able to work
on complex and demanding projects and enthusiastic
about participating in extensive ﬁeldwork in Southeast
Asia.
The position requires experience in ichthyology, phylo-
genetic systematics, and population genetics. Excellent
molecular (PCR, cloning, sequencing), and computa-
tional skills are essential, and knowledge of statistical
phylogeography and GIS based approaches would be
advantageous. The successful candidate will be super-
vised by Drs Lukas R¨ uber (PI), from whom additional
information can be obtained (l.ruber@nhm.ac.uk), and

Paris 1year PopulationModeling
Physiologically structured population models for via-
bility analysis One Post-doctoral position 2008-2009
available at the Ecology-Evolution Laboratory (CNRS,
UMR 7625) at the Ecole Normale Sup´ erieure (CERES-
ERTI) in Paris.
Applications are invited for a one-year postdoctoral
position funded by R2DS ( http://www.r2ds.centre-
cired.fr/ ) to investigate the dynamics of small popu-
lations with plastic life histories using physiologically
structured populations models.
Population persistence is notably conditioned by the
degree of individual variation in reproductive success,which depends on variation in any part of the life cycle.
Yet, the majority of studies that examined population
extinction have tended to ignore life history variation
and plasticity. Here, we wish to use life history models
to inform the dynamics of small populations and ask
how plasticity in life history traits inﬂuences extinction
dynamics. Many aspects of life history can interact
with population dynamics and the project concentrates
on three of them, namely growth, maturation and sur-
vival.
The post-doc will explore this issue by developing mod-
els that account for variation in life history traits us-
ing the theory of physiologically structured populations
(PSP). This theory takes into account that physiologi-
cal development (e.g. growth, maturation) depends on
the current state of the environment (e.g., temperature,
food and predator densities). In turn, the inﬂuence of
the population on the environment closes a feedback
loop between environment, population and life history.
The theory of PSP models is thus particularly well-
suited to study the interaction between population dy-
namics and plastic life history. Small populations are
subject to stochastic ﬂuctuation in abundance. The
project aims to study the feedback of this variability
on life history and the consequences for extinction dy-
namics. The models will be parameterized with esti-
mates from ﬁeld and experimental studies undertaken
with the common lizard, a species with strong thermal
and food plasticity in life history traits.
The post-doc will be based at the Ecology-Evolution
Laboratory (CNRS, UMR 7625) at the Ecole Normale
Sup´ erieure (CERES-ERTI) in Paris, where the appli-
cant will work with David Claessen and Jean-Fran¸ cois
Le Galliard. This post-doc project is part of a research
network on the dynamics of small populations funded
by ANR from 2008 to 2012 and will therefore inter-
act with a larger group of researchers. The post can
start on September 1st or October 1st 2008 and will
run for one year with a possible one year extension by
applying to extended funding from the R2DS network
in spring 2009. Gross salary will be 2500 per month.
The starting date can be postponed in exceptional cir-
cumstances.

able in the laboratory of Andreas Wagner at the Uni-
versity of Zurich. The project goal is to improve our un-
derstanding of the signaling, regulatory, and metabolic
networks involved in the yeast response to the nutri-
ents nitrogen and glucose. The successful candidate
will develop and improve mathematical models of yeast
nutrient signaling. He or she will use multiple criteria,
such as robustness of network variants to noise and mu-
tations, and the evolvability of network topologies, to
establish models for further experimental testing. The
position is funded through an interdisciplinary grant by
the Swiss Systems Biology Initiative, to a consortium
of experimental and computational laboratories. Per-
tinent consortium publications include Ciliberti et al.
PNAS 104, 13591-13596, 2007 and Kuepfer et al. Nat.
Biotech *25*, 1001-2006, 2007. The successful candi-
date will be embedded in an interdisciplinary group of
experimentalists and theorists from several universities.
The Wagner lab at the University of Zurich studies
biological systems on all levels of organization, from
genes, genomes, and genetic networks to whole organ-
isms. Ongoing projects range from laboratory evolution
experiments in yeast to human population genomics.
A sample of our research can be found at http://-
www.bioc.uzh.ch/wagner/ . Lab members are a group
with very diverse backgrounds and research projects,

Unique Opportunity for Ten Undergraduates 2009 Evo-
lutionary Genetics Field Study Abroad in China
With funding from NSF’s Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, we
are oﬀering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens or per-
manent residents only) the opportunity to participate
in a unique study abroad opportunity in China during
the summer of 2009 (mid-May through mid-July).
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic bio-
geographic study of species that are native to China
and invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a grow-
ing number of species native to the southeastern U.S.
and invasive in China. Each summer, we will run an
8 week OTS-style ﬁeld course where we will visit bio-
logical communities throughout China. After the ﬁeld
course, students can elect to continue in short-term re-
search internships in our partner labs in China.
Students will need to be prepared to take full advantage
of this experience. Each spring semester, students will
enroll at the University of Georgia (UGA) and take 3
courses; two in intensive elementary Mandarin Chinese
and a laboratory course in genetics. No prior experience
with Chinese language is required, although students
should have had at least a course in introductory biol-
ogy and preferably courses in ecology and evolutionary
biology.
The cost to the student of the summer program is min-
imal: the grant covers travel to and within China, lodg-
ing and most meals. The student is responsible for in-
surance, visa costs and personal expenses. Students are
also responsible for the costs of enrolling at the Univer-
sity of Georgia for all required courses (all students are
charged at the in-state tuition rate of ~$200 per credit
hour).
Applications for the 2009 program will be available on-
line late this summer and the deadline for application
is in the early fall. We encourage any interested stu-
dents to contact us. For more information, please see

Deadline Extension for Computational Phyloinformat-
ics: April 22
http://www.nescent.org/courses/2008/comphy/ 24
July - 4 August 2008
In response to requests from our applicants, we are ex-
tending the application deadline for our course on Com-
putational Phyloinformatics to Tuesday of next week,
April 22. Computational Phyloinformatics is a 10-day
summer course sponsored by and held at the National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) in Durham,
North Carolina (USA) that aims to give students prac-
tical knowledge and hands-on skills in phyloinformatics.
This course trains students, post-docs, faculty, and re-
searchers in phylogenetic computational thinking: in-
stead of being locked in to using point-and-click oﬀ-
the-shelf software, we show you how to write your own
scripts and programs to customize calculations, imple-
ment new statistical analyses, or devise pipelines for
high-throughput phylogenetics.
Writing and distributing your own Mesquite module,
pipelining data through BioPhylo, reﬁning evolution-
ary models in HyPhy, archiving and querying your lab’s
productivity in a database, and designing comparative
statistical analyses in R: these are not diﬃcult tasks,
but there are no textbooks to get you started – yet
the explosion of phyloinformatic data means that the
cutting-edge researcher has to be comfortable with com-
putational tools. That’s where we come in. This hands-
on course gets you over the learning curve: we help you
with the installations, show you what libraries to use,
and get you comfortable with writing your own pro-
grams.The course is divided into three parts:
- Part I: A tutorial review of either Perl, Java, or R
(while optional, this part is strongly recommended).
- Part II: Students have the choice of pursuing (1) a Perl
track, with focus on BioPerl and Bio::Phylo; (2) a Java
track, with focus on how to write a Mesquite module
and program workﬂows that utilize Mesquite modules;
or (3) an R track, with a focus on comparative phy-
logenetic analysis using the libraries Ape, Ouch, and
Phylobase.
- Part III: Students choose between (1) a database track
(with focus on SQL, BioSQL and database queries of
phylogenetic trees); (2) a HyPhy track (with focus on
scripting molecular evolution hypothesis tests in a phy-
logenetic framework); or (3) an advanced R track (with
focus on automating analyses using vectorized calcula-
tions, advanced plotting and animations, and the R-
LaTex document system using Sweave).
Students in all tracks will learn how to write basic phy-
logenetic or comparative analysis scripts, parse NEXUS
ﬁles, traverse and compute over trees, and make prac-
tical use of phylogenetic software libraries. These skills
will be learned in a biological context, touching on a
diverse array of topics (depending on the track) such
as alignment of large numbers of sequences, ancestral
state reconstruction, testing for positive selection, etc.

UppsalaU SexualSelection Oct3
Dear all,
Welcome to a one-day workshop for PhD students and92 EvolDir May 1, 2008
researchers in sexual selection (3rd Oct. 2008) at the
Evolutionary Biology Centre in Uppsala, Sweden.
Gender perspectives on the development of sexual se-
lection theory A GenNa workshop
Friday 3rd Oct. 2008 At the Evolutionary Biology Cen-
tre, Uppsala, Sweden
We welcome Ph.D. students and researchers in the ﬁeld
of sexual selection, working with sexual selection pro-
cesses (competition for mating partners, competition to
be chosen as a partner, competition for breeding oppor-
tunities, sexual conﬂicts, dynamics in sexual selection,
sexually selected pre- and postmating processes etc.)
in animals, plants and theory. We will reﬂect over and
analyse what processes are predominantly studied in
which sex and why. The aim is to increase our aware-
ness and by discussing gender perspectives contribute
to the development of a more gender-neutral evolution-
ary biology theory.
Invited lecturer: Distinguished Prof. Patricia Adair
Gowaty, UCLA, USA
The programme in short: 8.30 Get together 9-10 A
historical perspective on the development of sexual se-
lection theory. Prof. P. Gowaty 10-12 Group discus-
sions 12-13 Lunch 13-14 Future perspectives in sexual
selection. Lecture P. Gowaty. 14-17 Discussions on a
gender-neutral theory. 18- Dinner with continued dis-
cussions
Coordinators: Malin Ah-King, GenNa, Uppsala

Do you want to participate? Send an email with a short
motivation of your interest to the coordinators, 1st of
June the latest. The workshop is limited to 30 par-
ticipants. The workshop will require some preparatory
work: reading articles and writing an abstract reﬂecting

WellcomeTrust HumanGenomics
Aug17-22
Dear all,
This school is an opportunity for current leaders in hu-
man genomics to interact with future stars in the ﬁeld,
and for students to learn and be inspired by those that
have shaped human genomics in the last decade. We
are organising the 1st School of Human Genomics at
the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus from 17-22 Au-
gust 2008. The School of Human Genomics is a 5-day
meeting that brings together prominent human geneti-
cists and senior PhD students.
The schedule of this course is designed to be highly
interactive with integrated presentations by the tutors
and students, discussions about current topics in hu-
man genetics, and one-to-one meetings between tutors
and students. We expect that all tutors will stay for the
duration of the meeting. Additional events will likely
be scheduled in conjunction with the Human Genetics
Department at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
The closing date for applications is 15th May 2008.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.94 EvolDir May 1, 2008
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
