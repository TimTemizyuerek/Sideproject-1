To: US Citizen members of Evoldir
A proposal is being prepared to support travel to the
following symposium, which is by invitation only. The
prospective funding agency has indicated that it would
be eager to support the travel of young investigators
(graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and assistant
professors), particularly women and under-represented
minorities. US citizenship or resident alien status re-
quired. It is expected that those funded would par-
ticipate in the meeting but would not speak. If the
proposal is funded, funding would be announced on 20
Sept, so participants would need to be able to abide by
this schedule.
If you are interested, please reply with: 1. Name 2. US
citizen or resident alien? 3. Status (grad student, post-
doc, junior faculty)? 4. Female? 5. Underrepresented
minority? 6. A few sentences on your research interests
and how you might contribute to the symposium
International Symposium on Environmental Factors,
Cellular Stress and Evolution at Banaras Hindu Uni-
versity, Varanasi, India (October 14-16, 2006) Stress,
in one form or the other, aﬀects every biological sys-
tem. The proteome induced by cellular stresses has
been studied intensively during the past 3-4 decades.These studies have provided deep insights not only into
some of the basic cellular processes like protein fold-
ing, gene regulation, cellular homeostasis etc but have
also stimulated biotechnological and clinical applica-
tions. At a more basic biology level, it is clear that
environmental stress factors have been key players in
shaping organic evolution. However, this aspect has re-
ceived relatively less attention than molecular biology
of the stress responses. There is a strong need for under-
standing the roles of stress proteins and stress responses
from an integrative biological perspective. One of the
ways to achieve this is to provide a common platform
for interactions between those studying stress responses
and stress proteins in relation to evolutionary biology,
ecology, molecular biology or biotechnology points of
view. Keeping this objective in mind, a 2 day inter-
national symposium on “Environmental Factors, Cel-
lular Stress and Evolution” is planned at the Banaras
Hindu University, Varanasi, India on 14th and 15th Oc-
tober 2006 in conjunction with a meeting of the Oﬃ-
cers of the IUBS on 12th and 13th October 2006 at the
same place. In this part of the world, the environmen-
tal conditions are very diverse, and so is the biological
diversity. These factors provide very good models for
studying interactions between stress responses/proteins
and evolutionary forces. However, it is also true that
due to ﬁnancial constraints, the scientiﬁc community in
this region is generally unable to interact with leading
scientists in the ﬁeld and, therefore, not often able to
work at the forefront of ﬁeld. A major objective behind
organizing the above meeting in India is, therefore, toJune 1, 2006 EvolDir 3
have leading experts present extensive reviews in their
own areas of research to a large audience comprising
young faculty members and researchers/graduate and
under-graduate students from diﬀerent parts of India
and neighboring countries. This meeting will have only
invited lectures of about 40-45 min each. The speak-
ers have been asked not to concentrate only on their
research but to review their chosen topic and to dis-
cuss future directions keeping the philosophy of Inte-
grative Biology in mind. About 40 young faculty and
researchers will be invited from India and neighbouring
countries as participants. Undergraduate and graduate
students and faculty members from diﬀerent depart-
ments of the Banaras Hindu University will also attend
the lectures.

THEME AND SCOPE: Large-scale genome sequenc-
ing projects are generating vast amounts of data for a6 EvolDir June 1, 2006
multitude of organisms including mammals and other
vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, plants, bacteria, and
viruses. As the data increase so do the opportunities
and the challenges for scientists to interpret them. By
endeavouring to make sense of the process and pattern
of genome evolution, comparative genomics lies at the
forefront of this challenge. The core of comparative
genome analysis is the establishment of the correspon-
dence between genes (orthology analysis) or other ge-
nomic features in diﬀerent organisms. It is these in-
tergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the
evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence
of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events
acting at various organizational levels shape genome
evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations aﬀect
individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromo-
somal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer,
inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ulti-
mately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hy-
bridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often
leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome
evolution poses many exciting challenges to develop-
ers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have
recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and
mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuris-
tic, ﬁxed parameter and approximation algorithms for
problems based on parsimony models to Monte Carlo
Markov Chain algorithms for Bayesian analysis of prob-
lems based on probabilistic models. The RECOMB
Satellite Workshop on Comparative Genomics is a fo-
rum on all aspects and components of this ﬁeld, ranging
from new quantitative discoveries about genome struc-
ture and process to theorems on the complexity of com-
putational problems inspired by genome comparison.

Dear All,
Please note the workshop announced below, taking
place here in Portugal in a month from now. The dead-
line for applications is 31 May.
Thank you very much, Constantin Fesel
Workshop on Coalescent Theory and its perspectives in
human genetics and complex trait mapping
Time: June 21-24, 2006 Place: Instituto Gulbenkian de
Ciˆ encia (IGC), Oeiras, Portugal
Coalescent theory, an approach to reconstruct genealog-
ical relationships of a population sample with given in-
formation on extant gene diversity, was originally de-
veloped in the context of evolutionary genetics, where
patterns of past demography, selection and genetic drift
have been inferred. Recently, it is becoming a pos-
sible tool in human genetics, comprising the estima-
tion of distributions of recombination rates and partic-
ularly population-based mapping of genotypes underly-
ing complex traits.
The workshop is addressed to all researchers, postdocs
and students working on or interested in the subject,
and particularly to human geneticists. Two days of lec-
tures and discussion will be followed by practical exer-
cises with diverse available software for coalescent mod-
eling.
Particular subjects: Demographic history and selection
in coalescent models - Bayesian inference and MCMC
algorithms - Perspectives for human gene mapping.
Conﬁrmed speakers: Richard Hudson, University of

meeting this June in Stony Brook, New York. Fif-
teen individuals have generously volunteered to serve
as mentors, but the program will work best if we can
get this number up to thrity four. Duties will include
meeting with a pair of undergraduates in the program,
attending and demystifying a half-day of talks with
them, joining them for a meal, introducing them to
colleagues and in general befriending them in ways that
make evolutionary biology seem like a welcoming dis-
cipline. No costs for travel, housing or registration are
covered. Please spread the word about this very re-
warding activity.

Sydney SocConservBiol July10-13
Mark your calendars: the Australasian section of the
Society for Conservation Biology invites you to its in-
augural regional meeting of conservation scientists
When: July 10-13, 2007
Where: University of New South Wales, Sydney, Aus-
tralia
Topic: The Biodiversity Extinction Crisis, a Paciﬁc and
Australasian responseThe world faces its sixth great extinction event, driven
mainly by humans. Our region faces special challenges
including: island ecology, rising sea levels, changing
rainfall, and land and water degradation. These issues
are overlaid by the general problems of habitat loss and
fragmentation, invasive species, pollution and overhar-
vesting.
This conference identiﬁes the major problems for biodi-
versity conservation in our region, existing and poten-
tial solutions and links to the global biodiversity ini-
tiatives. Real opportunities can be found in the nexus
between conservation science and policy-makers, man-
agers and the community. There will be ﬁve major
themes: (1) Regional challenges (particular issues for
our part of the world); (2) Managing threatening pro-
cess of universal importance; (3) Case studies of con-
servation in action, including biodiversity monitoring
and assessment; (4) Conservation science and policy
and; (5) Conservation science and the community (non-
government organisations, indigenous people).
Information on the meeting, as well as registration and
abstract submission will be forthcoming.
We look forward to seeing you in Sydney in 2007

UAlaskaAnchorage Sticklebacks
Jul30-Aug4 AbstractCall
Greetings -
This is the ﬁnal call to submit abstracts for the Fifth
International Conference on Stickleback Behavior and
Evolution, to be held in Anchorage, Alaska July 30-
August 4, 2006. In addition to invited talks, we havereceived over sixty abstracts from researchers working
in dozens of institutions in twelve countries from Japan
to Finland and points in between. As of today, 73 peo-
ple have registered to attend. We have just a few more
spots available for presentations, and therefore we have
decided to extend the abstract deadline to May 7th to
provide the opportunity to present to anyone who may
have missed the May 1st deadline. The registration
will stay open until the start of the meeting (but costs
do rise incrementally), so even if you don’t submit an
abstract you can still take part in an exciting meeting.

WashingtonDC Retrovirus Oct8-11
This meeting will include sessions on viral emergence,
evolution and genomics.
Dear Colleague,
On behalf of the organizing committee for the 8th In-
ternational Feline Retrovirus Research Symposium to
be held in Washington DC October 8-11, 2006, I am
pleased to invite you to and members of your group to
submit abstracts of your latest work. The conference
promises to be an innovative and exciting blend of cat
genomics, retroviral research and advances in the cat
as a model of infectious disease.
Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by the Scientiﬁc
Committee and assigned to platform or poster presen-
tations (your preference would be helpful) and the best
of these would receive partial or full ﬁnancial support
for attendance. A signiﬁcant amount of the budget will
be allocated for this, so we really would encourage ab-
stract submission.
This is an exciting time for feline infectious disease re-
search and also feline genomics. The 2006 completion of
the complete cat genome sequence holds great promise
for expanding the role of the cat as a model of infectious
disease. We anticipate a unique blend of talks at the
conference and your participation would be a wonderful
contribution.
Please visit the conference website at http://-
ifrrs8.ncifcrf.gov for additional information, submission
of abstracts, and registration. Please note the deadline12 EvolDir June 1, 2006
for abstracts is July 15, 2006 and an early registration
discount deadline is June 1, 2006. Please feel free to
contact Dr Jill Pecon-Slattery or Dr. Naoya Yuhki of
the local organizing committee with any questions.

ExperimentalEvolRecombination
EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION OF RECOMBINA-
TION
The new Institute of Integrative Biology (IBZ) at ETH
Zurich (group of Paul Schmid-Hempel) is looking to ﬁll
a
PhD position
on the topic of
3Host-parasite co-evolution vs. meiotic recombination2
In most organisms, oﬀspring are produced sexually in-
volving meiotic recombination. Recombination gen-
erates genetic diversity in populations, but because
the parent1s successful genetic make-ups are thus de-
stroyed, the process is diﬃcult to understand in evolu-
tionary terms. Theoretical models suggest that recom-
bination should be selected against under a very wide
range of conditions, yet empirical evidence is scarce.
This project therefore addresses the problem by ex-
perimentally testing the consequences of host-parasite
co-evolution using populations of the Red Flour Beetle
(Tribolium castaneum), in the presence of co-evolving
parasites and other relevant selection regimes. The ex-
perimental populations will be screened by molecular
methods to identify genotypes of individuals etc., and
so to test some main hypotheses.
Please send application (CV, names and addresses of
referees) to Prof. Paul Schmid-Hempel, ETH Zurich,
Institute of Integrative Biology (IBZ), ETH-Zentrum
/ Universitatsstrasse 16, CH-8092 Zurich Switzerland;
or by email (psh@env.ethz.ch). Applications are being
reviewed starting 23 June 2006, or until post is ﬁlled.
Employment according to standard regulations of ETH.
Start of project: autumn 2006 or by mutual agreement.

PhD position: Evolutionary Ecology of Immune De-
fence
Institute of Integrative Biology (IBZ) at ETH Zurich,
Switzerland
Joachim Kurtz and Paul Schmid-Hempel seek a grad-
uate student interested in doing a PhD on the topic
of the evolutionary ecology of immune defence. The
project will focus on the evolution of phenotypic plas-
ticity in immunity. The major goals are (1) to inves-
tigate the extent of phenotypic plasticity in the im-
mune response of an invertebrate (the ﬂour beetle Tri-
bolium castaneum), (2) to experimentally test its bene-
ﬁts, costs and health impacts with regard to pathogenic
and nutritional environmental conditions, (3) to use an
experimental evolution approach for studying the evo-
lutionary signiﬁcance of phenotypic plasticity. Since
the project will include the study of long-term pheno-
typic adaptation, which might be transferred between
generations, it will touch the recently highly debated
ﬁeld of epigenetic change.

ﬁsh stocks. The impacts of selective recreational ﬁsh-
ing mortality on yield, stock structure and salient life-
history traits shall be modelled depending on ﬁsheries
intensity, varying regulations (e.g. size limits) and con-
sidering diﬀerent population parameters (e.g. growth
rate). Moreover, eco-genetic models to analyse the po-
tential of recreational ﬁshing to induce evolutionary
changes are expected to be constructed and analysed.
The projects ultimately aims at deriving recommenda-
tions for ﬁsheries management and conservation.
Qualiﬁcations: M.Sc. degree in Natural Sciences such
as Theoretical Biology, Applied Mathematics, Fisheries
Biology, Computer Sciences or comparable degree with
a focus on quantitative approaches to understand the
population dynamics of exploited animals; experiences
with programming (e.g., C ++) and mathematical soft-
ware (e.g., Matlab) are explicitly requested; experiences
with quantitative population models or ﬁsh stock as-
sessment; good working knowledge of English; above
average communication skills and team spirit; ability to
work independently; high motivation; familiarity with
recreational angling would be a beneﬁt.
The position is open until ﬁlled. It is limited to three
years and will be paid according to TV¨ oD (service class
wage agreement, depending on age and marital status
roughly 25.000 Euro per year gross income, heath insur-
ance covered, the wage is equivalent to 0.5 the wage of
a full time scientist). It is anticipated that the success-
ful candidate will split attendance between residence
at IGB and IIASA. Applications by females are par-
ticularly encouraged. Disabled persons with identical
qualiﬁcations will be favoured.
Please send your application, preferably by email, with
the usual material (expression of interest, CV, copies of
certiﬁcates, if available representative reprints of pub-
lished work) including a short statement of personal re-

Graduate Student Opportunity - Genotoxicology of
Fathead Minnows exposed to contaminated sediments
in situ.
We seek a M.Sc. student for a collaborative study of
fathead minnows that we will cage in situ near a histor-
ical coal tar spill (Randle Reef) and at reference sites
near by in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, and then
return to the laboratory for follow-up evaluation. The
longer-term goal is to assess the genetic damage, long-
term developmental eﬀects, and reproductive eﬀects in
ﬁsh caused by exposure to Randle Reef water and sed-
iment before, during, and after the Randle Reef clean-
up operation. The student will gain experience expos-
ing fathead minnows to sediments, and rearing ﬁsh oﬀ-
spring to assess heritable mutations. As well, we will
examine germ-line mutations in tandem repeat DNA,
vitellogenin levels, developmental deformities, and sur-
vival of the exposed adults’ fry. Transfer to a Ph.D.
program may be possible depending upon the timing
of the spill clean-up. The student will be based in
the Biology Department at McMaster University and
will work part of the time with collaborators Drs. Jim
Sherry and Joanne Parrott, Environment Canada Sci-
entists, at Canada Centre for Inland Waters. Please

CONCERNS: 3-Years PhD position available at the
Roscoﬀ Marine Station, Team: Plankton Evolution and
Paleoceans.
The group Plancton Oceanique at the SBR in Brittany,
France, is a one of the world leader in the ﬁelds of
molecular ecology, evolution, and physiology of marine
unicellular plankton ( http://www.sb-roscoﬀ.fr/Phyto/-
). The new team Plankton Evolution and Paleoceans
(PI: Colomban de Vargas; Research Engineer: Ian
Probert; PhD students: Miguel Frada and Hui Liu) ex-
plores key aspects of the biological, functional, and eco-
logical diversities within the two main groups of pelagic
micro-calciﬁers: the coccolithophores and foraminifers.
Having build kilometer-thick, exceptionally well pre-
served carbonate deposits at the ocean ﬂoor, these pro-
tists have played a fundamental role in the ecology and
geology of Earth System for the last ~200 My. The bi-
ological (genomics, physiology, ecology, biogeography),
chemical (isotopics, trace elements within the micro-
skeletons), and morphological (optic and electron mi-
croscopy) information we extract from living species
are used to assess their mode and rate of evolution,
and re-interpret their fossil record and impact on bio-
geochemical cycles.
PhD project: Role of Red-Queen selection, life cycle,
and sex in the evolution of marine pelagic viruses and
their hosts (coccolithophores).
This project will be co-supervised by Colomban de Var-
gas (SBR) and Willie Wilson (Plymouth Marine Labo-
ratory, http://www.pml.ac.uk/pml/ ). It is part of ES-
Team, a new European PhD program of excellence in
marine genomics and molecular ecology, hold at the
SBR ( http://www.sbroscoﬀ.fr/ESTeam/ ).
Project Abstract: Modern optical and genomic tech-
niques have revealed extremely abundant and diverse
marine planktonic viruses. Although the inﬂuence of
viruses on marine geochemical cycles (via the regu-
lation of host populations), and prokaryote evolution
(via lateral gene transfer), is well recognized, the pro-
cesses creating and maintaining such huge oceanic vi-
ral diversity, including its rate of evolution, are largely
unknown. Mechanisms of co-evolution between hosts
and their viruses, where both are ﬁghting to respec-
tively decrease and increase virulence, are certainly
playing critical roles. We propose to test two main hy-
potheses, using the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi
as model: (A) virulence in pelagic host-virus interac-
tions is highly speciﬁc, constrained by the boundaries
between species, sub-species, or strains; (B) virulence
is not species speciﬁc, but life-stages speciﬁc, and thus
constrained by the sexual alternation between haploid
and diploid populations. Experiments will test if Red-Queen processes are driving ecological/evolutionary di-
versiﬁcation in coccolithoviruses and their hosts, and
will address whether host evolution is driven by rapid
genomic mutations, or rather by genomic restructur-
ing through haploidization and/or genetic recombina-
tion associated with sex. Results will enhance our un-
derstanding of the nature and tempo of evolution of
planktonic host-virus interactions.

Announcement2CONCERNS: 3-Years PhD position available at the
Roscoﬀ Marine Station, Team: ?Evolution & G´ en´ etique
des Populations Marines?.
The group ?EGPM? (resp. M. Valero) at the SBR
in Brittany, France, is actually well-recognized in the
ﬁelds of molecular ecology, evolution, population ge-
netics. The group is sub-divided into 4 main research
topics: Life cycles, reproductive strategies and popu-
lation structure (C. Destombe), Selection & adapta-
tions (D. Jollivet), Dispersal & phylogeography (M.
Valero) and Genetics and microevolution of invasive
species (F. Viard). The group is investigating macro-
and micro-evolutionnary processes that shape popula-
tions over various spatial scales in algae and marine
invertebrates. Among these four main topics, ?Selec-
tion & adaptations (PI: D. Jollivet) explores key as-
pects of the thermal and chemical adaptation of the
deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna using both transcrip-
tomic (micro-arrays) and candidate gene (allele coa-
lescence) approaches. The ultimate goal is to found
speciﬁc adaptive eukaryot molecular signatures associ-
ated with ?high? temperatures and anoxia and to un-
derstand how adaptive polymorphisms could be main-
tained in such a heterogeneous and instable environ-
ment.
PhD project: Study of thermal and oxidative stress in
the hydrothermal vent polychaete Alvinella pompejana
This project will be co-supervised by Didier Jollivet
(SBR), Arnaud Tanguy (SBR) and Franck Zal (SBR).
It is part of ESTeam, a new European PhD program of
excellence in marine genomics and molecular ecology,
hold at the SBR ( http://www.sbroscoﬀ.fr/ESTeam/ ).
Project Abstract: Eurythermal eukaryotes associated
with deep-sea hydrothermal vents are one of the most
exposed organisms to highly ﬂuctuant thermal regimes
over small spatial scales. Using both transcriptomic
and proteomic approaches, the aim of our project is
1) to identify enzyme systems involved in the response
of Alvinella pompejana, the “Pompeii worm”, to ther-
mal and oxidative stresses, 2) to compare patterns of
gene expression between colonists (?hot? conditions)
and reproducers (?cool? conditions) in order to iden-
tify a set of stress-regulated genes that could provide
useful candidate genes for the detection of adaptive
polymorphims and 3) to identify over a large set of
genes, diﬀerent-thermally adapted alleles in colonists
(ﬁrst young individuals that settle on new ’hot’ chim-
neys) as opposed to reproducers (well-established indi-
viduals in aged populations from which thermal condi-
tions are much more cooler).

Genes with small ﬁtness eﬀects: estimating eﬀects of
codon bias in sexually reproducing experimental popu-
lations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
The laboratory of Professor Einar Arnason, Institute of
Biology, University of Iceland, is oﬀering a three-year
Ph.D. stipend.
The project, a combination of molecular biology and
population/evolutionary genetics, is an experimental
perturbation/reperturbation study of ﬁtness eﬀects of
genes having small eﬀects on Darwinian ﬁtness. Codon
usage and codon bias are excellent systems for experi-
ments of this kind. Experiments will be conducted to
estimate directly ﬁtness eﬀects of alternative silent-site
mutations in codons of highly codon-biased genes. The-
ory and comparative molecular evolution studies pre-
dict small selection coeﬃcients for such variation. The
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism par
excellence, is the experimental organism of choice. The
possibility of direct gene replacements, tagging of genes
and very high meiotic recombination rate are among the
important features making yeast the most suitable or-
ganism for studies on genes with small eﬀects on ﬁtness.
The population genetics/evolutionary biology labora-
tory is located in Askja, the new Natural Sciences
Building at the University of Iceland. The labora-
tory shares facilities with molecular biology/genetics
and cell biology/virology with state of the art equip-
ment for molecular and cell biology. It also has high
power computer facilities running various software for
data analysis and simulation under Linux, Mac OS X,
or Windows. The student will be part of a research
team numbering between 20 and 30 students, post-docs
and senior researchers.
We are searching for a highly motivated and quali-20 EvolDir June 1, 2006
ﬁed student in a relevant ﬁeld preferably with labora-
tory/research experience. We are looking for a student
with a background in molecular biology and keen inter-
est in population genetics/evolutionary biology, or, a
student with a background in population/evolutionary
biology and a keen interest in molecular biology. Stud-
ies will start in August 1, 2006 (or as agreed upon).
The studies will be completed with a thesis defense at
the end of the period.
For acceptance into the PhD program in the Faculty
of Science at the University of Iceland the applicant
must hold an MSc degree (3 year PhD program) or
a BSc degree (4 year PhD program including courses)
in a relevant ﬁeld with a grade-point average of 7 out
of 10 or equivalent. Relevant ﬁelds include population
genetics, evolutionary biology, genetics, biochemistry,
molecular biology. Available courses are few but small
and high-level and with top-notch teachers. Gradu-
ate level courses in other Nordic or European countries
and North America are also accepted. It may be pos-
sible that the student does 20% teaching and super-
vision of undergraduates which may extend the stud-
ies to approximately four or ﬁve years (for M.Sc. and
B.Sc. students respectively). The stipend amounts to
2.5 million Icelandic kronur per annum for three years
(approximately US$ 33,000 at current exchange rates)
before taxes and insurance.
Deadline for application is June 30, 2006. Applications
should include copies of undergraduate and graduate

Investigating the Geographic Structure and Adaptive
Evolution of RNA Viruses
Gene and genome sequences contain new and unique
information about biological processes. The rapid and
increasing accumulation of such data, together with
recent advances in aﬀordable computer power, means
that more evolutionary hypotheses can be tested by
computational analysis of biological sequences. Such
analyses can help us to understand the behaviour of
important human viral pathogens, including HIV, in-
ﬂuenza, Hepatitis C virus, and Dengue virus.
This project aims to develop new methods and com-
puter programs to infer the spatial location and geo-
graphic movement of viruses from gene sequence data.
The theoretical foundation for this project is already
fairly well-developed; given a set of virus gene sequences
with known sampling dates and sampling locations, the
models are used to calculate the probability of observ-
ing such data under a speciﬁed model of migration.
From this can be obtained the best-ﬁtting model of
migration, in addition to estimates of migration rates
among locations. A key technical challenge will be to
develop and implement more realistic models of genetic
geographic structure. Further epidemiological hypothe-
ses can be tested by using the methods to track the
movement of viral strains among diﬀerent risk groups
(instead of diﬀerent locations). Lastly, the methods de-
veloped could be extended and used to investigate the
dynamics of adaptive evolution in viral pathogens.

in Neuroinformatics and Computational Neuroscience
How does the brain work?
The electrical activity of the billions of neurons in the
brain accounts for our perceptions, thoughts, feelings
and behaviours. Yet it is still unknown exactly what
the link is between activity in these networks of neu-
rons, and the cognitive or behavioural functions they
serve. In this studentship, you will explore the pos-
sibilities of a new computational technique, Dynamic
Bayesian Network (DBN) Inference Algorithms, to in-
fer network connectivity and function in networks of
neurons recorded from real brains. You will develop
new algorithms and apply them to the analysis of
multiple-single-unit recordings from the rat hippocam-
pus, among others. You will also compare the abilities
of the DBN to other, published information extracting
algorithms. Your work will help us understand how in-
formation ﬂows in the brain, and potentially lead to
greater understanding of how this information ﬂow re-
lates to brain function.
This research is part of a larger consortium in Neu-
roinformatics (CARMEN: Code Analysis, Repository
and Modelling for e-Neuroscience), which puts it at the
cutting edge of Integrative Neuroscience. You will be
connected in and interacting with a network of some of
the UK’s leading researchers in neuroinformatics and
computational neuroscience.The studentship will be based at the School of Biology
at the University of St Andrews, and will be jointly su-
pervised by Dr. V. Anne Smith (St Andrews) and Dr.
Tom V. Smulders (Newcastle University). Applicants

ABI3130 costs
Our department has recently purchased an ABI 3130xl
for DNA sequencing and fragment analysis. We expect
that our usage of the instrument will vary, and there
may be some weeks where it is only needed for a few
runs. Given that, we would like to minimize our costs
for consumable reagents, particularly polymer. ABI
suggests changing any polymer bottle that has been
on the instrument more than a week. Has anyone tried
running the instrument with older polymer? If so, how
old? Any adverse eﬀects on the data or the instrument?
Also, any other tips for saving on reagents during peri-
ods of inconsistent use would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you,

Arlequin question
Subject: Arlequin.question
Hi all
Have a question about the Arlequin program. Can you
use allele frequencies only (or fq values converted to
numbers); without genotype or haplotype data to esti-
mate Fst’s? In the manual it looks if you can do that
but when I try to the program gives me an error.
I pasted my input ﬁle below. You will see I converted
my fq to numbers and standard data, because in the fq
format it gives the same error. (I use the newest ver-
sion of Arl) . So, when I do a run with this input ﬁle;
the settings under Pop comparisons are Copute Slakins
Fst and I tried the “use conventional Fsts” (which the
manual speciﬁes that I must use in my case) and the
other two options but all gives the following error:
#[ERROR # 1] : unable to read genotype frequency
#[ERROR # 2] : unable to read sample data
So to me it looks like Arlequin cannot compute Fst’s
from fq data only, the program looks for the extra ﬁle in
which your haplotype/genotype data is usually stored
if you’re working with raw data. Am I correct or is
there a way to estimate Fst’s from fq data only?
Thank you
Carina

Biodiversity texts
Hi,
In a moment of insanity, I volunteered to develop and
teach a new course for ﬁrst year students (primarily
aimed at non-majors) on the Evolution and Diversity
of Life on Earth. The primary impetus is a growing
realization that the current generation of students are
growing up in an increasingly urban environment and
have little or no appreciation for the vast diversity of
living organisms that we are rapidly driving to extinc-
tion. My original plan was based loosely on Margulis
et al., “The Illustrated Five Kingdoms”, which is, well,42 EvolDir June 1, 2006
a coloring book. That in itself is not a problem with
me, but it is organized ecologically, and my preference
is a phylogenetic approach. I now need to decide on
a textbook, and other resources to oﬀer the course for
the ﬁrst time next fall. Has anyone out there developed
such a course? Do you have any suggestions for useful
texts and other resources? Any suggestions for how to
approach such a course would be very much appreci-
ated.

Chicken data
Hi all,
We are a team that wants to develop a statistical proce-
dure based on Bayesian Segregation and Linkage analy-
sis to determine Major Genes aﬀecting chicken produc-
tion traits. This procedure has so many beneﬁts that
there is not any space to explain all of them. We are
seeking some information for our project. We are re-
quested all of the scientists and commercial chicken pro-
duction companies to give necessary information. We
will promise to share all of our ﬁndings and include
their names in all of our publications.
Data speciﬁcations:
1- Phenotypic records for pedigreed populations for
many (at least 10) generations.
2- Preferably, data would be related to commercial pure
lines.
3- Molecular data (based on microsatellites, many and
full coverage of the genome) for last two (GP and P)
generations along with same phenotypic data.
If any further information are needed, please contact
us.

DNA extraction in Solen
Dear evoldir members,
I have problems with DNA extraction too. Im working

methods and from diﬀerent fresh tissues but the DNA
is always degradated (I only got smear at the bottom
of each lane). I have some experience working on the

this, it seems that there is something that degrates the
DNA of this species. Does anyone know what could it
be?

resolution? What is the ideal case? What kind of
sampling design should be absolutely avoided? Sam-
pling and time-depth of markers: a same sampling with
fast-mutating markers and with slow-mutating mark-
ers? Linguistic classiﬁcations? Ethnological classiﬁ-
cation? Ethical concerns How to mention the sampling
in publications (longitude-latitude, linguistic classiﬁca-
tion, ethologic classiﬁcation, etc)?
We are thinking to such a session because the literature
on the subject is limited and we feel that there is a lack
of investigation on this methodological issue that, to
tell the truth, is the base of our articles.
We welcome any member of Evoldir able to contribute
REFERENCES, suggest experts or provide suggestions
concerning the points stated above. If you are the au-
thor of an important article focusing on DNA sampling
strategies we may invite you in Paris for the conference.
We stress that such call just concerns the SAMPLING
since a further, more general, call for abstracts will fol-
low later.

Data on new mutations
This may be a tall order, but if any readers can help Iwould appreciate it. I am looking for good data on 1.
The distribution of allelic eﬀects of new mutations in
a known gene (presumably measured as mean eﬀects,
but I’d be interested in any other good measures that
have been used) on some measured phenotype. l’d be
interested in references to data sources, especially from
naturally occurring organisms. I’m aware of many hu-
man disease gene data bases, which are useful except
that they usually only include patients, and hence not
all the naturally occurring mutations, and they only in-
clude those instances of a mutation that came to clinical
attention.
2. Direct data on the empirical distribution of ﬁtness
eﬀects of new mutations, studied in relation to a speciﬁc
phenotype. I am aware of the extensive literature on
indirect measures like Ka/Ks ratios and other indica-
tors derived from genomic scans. I have John Endler’s
1986 book on selection in the wild, but am in search
of systematic studies that may have been done that
have assessed ﬁtness in relation to known mutations,
and especially where multiple individual mutations are
known for the same gene or trait. Data on any eukary-
ote species, including domestic or laboratory species
would be of interest.
I know there is a large scattered literature on individ-
ual examples, but am trying to learn of systematic data
that may exist.
Any comments or assistance would be appreciated. If
I’m just highly ignorant of a large systematic literature,
I’d be delighted to have my ignorance pointed out.....if
you can do it politely!
Thanks for anyone who can help.

Dianthus specimens
Dianthus samples44 EvolDir June 1, 2006
Dear EvolDir readers,
As part of my PhD project I am investigating the evo-
lutionary radiation and diversiﬁcation of the genus Di-
anthus (Caryophyllaceae). I will attempt to address di-
versiﬁcation at the morphological and molecular level.
At the morphological level I will be looking at nectar
tube lengths and various pollination strategies. At the
molecular level I will be constructing evolutionary trees
from DNA markers. This will contribute to information
present on this taxonomically diﬃcult genus.
As Dianthus species occur in many countries it is not
possible for me to visit every one to collect. I was won-
dering if anyone has any Dianthus specimens or know
of recent herbarium specimens that may be available
for my project.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Evol psychology
Dear colleagues,
I’m writing a chapter on how evolutionary psychology
is conducted and perceived, and I’ve only gathered data
on perceptions of the ﬁeld via informal conversations.
Thus, I’m very curious to learn what members of evoldir
think of evolutionary psychology.
I would really appreciate it if you would send me an
email indicating whether evolutionary psychology has
proven to be helpful to your understanding of human
behavior, and why or why not. I’d love to hear your
thoughts on either side of this issue, even if it’s just a
two-word response.
Assuming suﬃcient interest, I’ll create a table that sum-
marizes the type and frequency of responses to this
question, and post it to the list.
Best regards,

F Jacob quotation
I have been trying with limited success to locate the pre-
cise wording of, and citation for, a quotation attributed
to Francois Jacob that I have always liked. The para-
phrased version of the quote I heard was:
There are really only three questions in biology: how
does it work? how does it develop? how does it evolve?
The closest version I have unearthed mentions only two
questions:
“How does it work?, Where does it come from?” (p.
31, Jacob, F. 1982. The Possible and the Actual. The
Jesse and John Danz Lectures. Parthenon, New York)
I would be grateful for any leads to the three-question
version, or, alternatively, any assurances that I am on a
wild (Canadian) goose chase and should remain content
with the two-question version.

FIS calculations
At the request of many Evoldir members, I will sum-
marize the responses to my original inquiry, which was:
>Does anyone know of a program that will give conﬁ-
dence intervals >from bootstrapping over loci for F-
IS, separately for every >population? > >I would
like to compare F-IS values among populations for
>microsatellite data. Most programs calculate only one
overall F-IS >value for the entire set of populations. >
>It would be tedious to create a set of single popu-
lation input >ﬁles, and then analyze them separately.
Although I have not >explored it thoroughly, I know
that even this option will not work >in some cases.
(Some programs will not calculate any F statistics >at
all for an input ﬁle that has only one population.)
I would add two additional notes: First, in case the
original posting was not clear, the speciﬁc goal is to
have conﬁdence intervals for F-IS for each individual
population. Without these, one cannot say with any
statistical certainty whether one population has more
or less inbreeding than another population.
Second, most software programs test the null hypothe-
sis of no population structure by permuting individuals,
genotypes or gene copies over populations. (Or some
similar “exact test”.) But 1) this method does not
provide conﬁdence intervals, and 2) strictly speaking,
I believe that permutation approaches do not test the
same hypothesis as bootstrapping or jackkniﬁng over
loci (when mutiple loci are available). I will leave a
discussion of that distinction for someone to pick up in
another thread....
Please email the group if there are any major correc-
tions to the summary below.
Programs that will calculate population-speciﬁc CIs
for F-IS: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- GDA ( http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/people/-
plewis/software.php ) Will bootstrap over loci to gen-46 EvolDir June 1, 2006
erate conﬁdence intervals. To get population-speciﬁc
F-IS values in each population, exclude all but one pop-
ulation in the Misc menu. Very intuitive interface and
menu system.
GENETIX http://www.genetix.univ-montp2.fr/-
genetix/genetix.htm Will both bootstrap over loci and
perform permutation analyses for F-IS values in each
population. The software is in French, so get out your
dictionary if necessary. In the FSTATS menu, TEST
SUR FIS and choose the bootstrap or permutation
option. You can choose all populations as well as all
loci separately.
SPAGeDi http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ecoevol/-
spagedi.html I am told that this program will perform
the desired analyses, but I have not veriﬁed this. The
manual mentions one-delete jackknife procedures for
estimating conﬁdence intervals, but does not mention
bootstrapping,
Programs that will not calculate population-speciﬁc
CIs for F-IS: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - FSTAT
http://www2.unil.ch/popgen/softwares/fstat.htm TF-
PGA http://www.marksgeneticsoftware.net/tfpga.htm
These two programs will calculate signiﬁcance for over-
all F-statistics by bootstrapping over loci. However,
they will not calculate locus-speciﬁc F-IS conﬁdence in-
tervals. They will not perform these calculations on a
ﬁle with only one population.
GENEPOP ON THE WEB http://-
wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/genepop/ Calculates overall
and locus-speciﬁc F-IS values, but does not speciﬁcally
test the signiﬁcance of F-IS, or provide conﬁdence
intervals. (Options 1, 5, 6) Siginiﬁcance is assessed
with permutation tests.
ARLEQUIN 3 http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/-
arlequin3/ Runs permutation tests for an overall F-IS.
Does not calculate locus-speciﬁc F-IS values. Does
not bootstrap over loci. Laurent Excoﬃer has told me
that the next version (late June) will compute FIS for
each population, and test it by permutation, but no
bootstrap CI will be provided.

GeneClean alternatives
Dear all,
Does anyone recommend a kit (with spin columns) to
purify genomic DNA that ISN’T a Qbiogene GeneClean
product, but contains glassmilk?
We have been using the Qbiogene (now MPBiomed-
icals) GeneClean Turbo kits to purify extracted ge-
nomic DNA following a phenol/chloroform procedure
on fungal/oomycete-infected plant material. The kits
provide glass milk-containing spin columns and two
binding salt formulations - one for DNA fragments
<3kb (ie. pcr products) and another for genomic DNA.
I assume the diﬀerence in formulations is necessary.
However, while they provide enough salt solution for
PCR/fragments for the entire kit, they only provide
1/4 of the necessary ’GNomic’ solution.
Qbiogene used to provide upon request extra bottles of
the gnomic salt solution, to make full use of the kit, but
now MPBiomedicals is refusing to do the same, won’t
sell them seperately, and seems confused by our needs.
I’m desperate to ﬁnd an alternative kit that won’t
slow our extractions throughput (home-made glass milk
might be too cumbersome) or compromise our DNA
quality.
I’m extremely grateful for any comments or recommen-dations. If i receive such I would be happy to repost
them to the list.

GeneDropping in GD
Dear EvolDir Members,
I am a PhD student at the University of Otago in New
Zealand. I am investigating inbreeding and the losses
of genetic diversity (GD) using molecular and pedigree
methods. I am particular interested in whether species
which have historically gone through severe bottlenecks
and already have low GD, have a slower rate of further
loss of GD (due to inbreeding or further bottlenecks)
relative to species that have only experienced recent
bottlenecks.
I have applied the pedigree method of gene-dropping
(using PM2000) to investigate the relative losses of GD
due to pedigree structure (in a genetically depauparate
endangered bird, the takahe). As you may know, gene-
dropping involves assigning two unique alleles to each
founder, and performs simulations to estimate the rela-
tive loss of overall GD in the descendent popn. based on
a given pedigree. I am interested in knowing whether it
would be worthwhile to estimate the absolute losses us-
ing real microsatellite gene frequencies from the founder
population and the descendants, after 7 regenerations
of moderate inbreeding.
It is unclear whether we would expect any substantial
diﬀerences between the relative losses (as measured by
gene-drop) and absolute losses of GD. Is anyone aware
of any studies that have investigated this question using
genedropping?
Does anyone know of any software that will allow me
to manually set the initial starting allele frequencies or
genotypes for a genedrop analysis?
Thank you,

InsectDNA preservation answers
A few weeks back I asked about the use of propylene
glycol (nontoxic, not ﬂammable) to preserve insect tis-
sues for DNA work. Thanks to all those who replied.
Below I include a summary of the replies (after the orig-
inal post) including a summary of my own results using
my own focal group - silphid beetles.
The short answer is that there were few replies but most
were positive about the value of PG.
ORIGINAL POST:
This paper recent paper on the use of 100% propylene
glycol for preservation of spiders for later DNA extrac-
tion is exciting because propylene glycol is non-toxic
(it’s a food additive) and thus can be safely mailed and
carried on planes etc. It eﬀectively dehydrates the tis-
sues.

nid DNA Author(s): Vink CJ, Thomas SM, Paquin P,
Hayashi CY, Hedin M Source: INVERTEBRATE SYS-
TEMATICS 19 (2): 99-104 2005
I’d like to know if anyone has additional experience with
this method of preservation. The authors used spidersso one might assume the method would work for all
arthropods - has anyone used it with insects?
I wonder speciﬁcally if larger bodied insects might not
preserve as well in PG as in ethanol if the ethanol pen-
etrates the tissues to dehydrate them faster than PG.
I’d also like to know if propylene glycol is a viable long-
term alternative to high-grade ethanol for specimens
stored at -80C.
Finally, I’m curious if there are any issues with DNA ex-
traction - does the PG need to be thoroughly removed
from the specimen for successful extraction? and if so,
how is this done?
I’ll collect replies oﬀ-list and summarize them for a later
posting.
Thanks!

REPLY 1:
Hey Derek
If you take a closer look at the paper, you will see that
not only spiders were used, but also scorpions. And
these were quite large scorpions. That may partly an-
swer you questions. Just keep in mind that these results
were for a month only of preservation. The longer term
paper in coming along!
Cheers
Pierre
REPLY 2 (in part)
I was just going to follow what they did in the paper,
that is to transfer the specimens back to ethanol, keep
overnight in a refridgerator and then proceed with the
extraction the next day as usual. I would normally
transfer leg from ethanol to deinoized water, let sit for
about 20 minutes then dry out on kimwipe and proceed
to extraction.
REPLY 3
Hi Derek,
Just to update you - I received my spiders in propy-
lene glycol, transferred whole specimens to ethanol
overnight at 4 degrees (in fridge). The next day I used
2 legs from each specimen, dried the legs on kimwipes
before adding to lysis buﬀer (Qiagen-DNeasy kit) and
extracted DNA as usual.
The results from my PCR using both mitochdrial COI
primers and those for a single-copy nuclear locus were
excellent for all specimens. Thus, it seems at least for
spiders, the propylene glycol is not a problem if you
transfer to ethanol for 24 hrs and dry out prior to ex-June 1, 2006 EvolDir 49

days earlier so it was very good starting material.
Anyway, hope this is helpful.

Hello Derek Unfortunately we didn’t include the speci-
mens preserved in propylene glycol for our long term (1
year) storage experiment - we didn’t expect propylene
glycol to work so well. However, I see no reason why
propylene glycol wouldn’t be ﬁne for long term storage
provided they are kept at -20 or -80, which improves
long term storage signiﬁcantly. Propylene glycol does,
however, shrivel soft tissue (eg genitalia).
The large scorpions we used were quite water-tight but
there seemed to be no problem in the propylene glycol
penetrating their tissues. We euthanized them by freez-
ing to ensure they they didn’t close their oral, anal and
respiratory openings. Whenever I preserve any large
or water-tight arthropods (eg weevils) I tend to pull
oﬀ a leg or two and/or dissect/cut it to make sure the
preservative reaches all the tissues.
Before DNA extraction of propylene glycol preserved
specimens we transferred them to 95% EtOH for one
day at 4 C (see Methods, Specimen preservation, 5) -
this allowed the specimens to be dried prior to extrac-
tion.
Hope this of use.

Dear Derek
I did some assays with PG as a ﬁxative several months
ago. I used ascidian tissue and three ﬁxation proce-
dures: ethanol, ethanol plus change to PG after 3 days,
and PG directly.
I extracted and sequenced the samples after ca 4 weeks,
and sequenced a fragment of COI. In short, the best re-
sults were with the samples ﬁxed in ethanol, the ones
ﬁxed in ethanol and afterwards

I am looking for advice about digital cameras for use
with microscopes (with a C-mount for the lens). I am

for the microscope and just need the camera.

MultAlin Vs Sequencher Alignment
Dear EvolDir Members,
I have run into a snag while designing some primers.
In comparing the alignments given by the Sequencher
(software) and by MultAlin (online), I always receive
diﬀerent alignments for the same sequences. I was won-
dering if anyone knew how these two programs put gaps
into their sequences? Which alignment is most cor-
rect? Which gaps do I believe? Perhaps there is a way
to check against the protein sequence? however I am
looking outside the coding region, so this may not be
that helpful.
Any ideas would be much appreciated, or if anyone
knows a deﬁnitive answer as to which program gives
the most consistent, accurate multiple-species sequence
alignment, that would be most helpful!
Thanks in advance for your time and help.

Neotropical Raptors
Hi Everybody,
I am a Msc. student at a south-american University,
studying phylogeny and population genetics of some
groups of Accipitridae in the Neotropics. This study use
a microsatellite (heterologous) markers designed for Im-
perial Eagle. I am currently in search of studies made
with microsatellites in any other accipitridae. Apart
from Bego˜ na Martinez-Cruz, is there anybody currently
developing accipitridae microsats and who is willing to
collaborate in this study? I am also looking to check
other Falconiforme microsats. The only information I
need is the sizes of the alleles of the diﬀerent markers.
Is anybody aware of the existence of these or other un-
published falconiformes microsats? Could you please
send replies directly to me at mafegomez@yahoo.com.
Thanks for your help,

PAUP timing
Dear evoldir members-Are there any current methods for estimating a ballpark
amount of time it may take to perform a maximum
likelihood procedure using Paup, given a speciﬁc set
of conditions such as processor speed, number of taxa,
length of sequence and number of variable sites? For in-
stance, I want to estimate approximately (within a few
days) how long it will take my computer to complete an
analysis of a dataset that includes 113 individuals, 360
bases and an enormous level of sequence divergence.

Phylogenetics book
Published Spring 2006
Avise, J.C. 2006. Evolutionary Pathways in Nature: A
Phylogenetic Approach. Cambridge University Press,52 EvolDir June 1, 2006
New York (286 pp.)
Reconstructing phylogenetic trees from DNA sequences
has become a popular exercise in many branches of
biology, and here an award- winning geneticist ex-
plains why. Molecular phylogenies provide a genealogi-
cal backdrop for interpreting the evolutionary histories
of many other types of biological traits (anatomical,
behavioral, ecological, physiological, biochemical, and
even geographical). Guiding readers on a natural his-
tory tour along dozens of evolutionary pathways, the
author describes how creatures ranging from microbes
to elephants came to possess their current phenotypes.
If you want to know how the toucan got its bill and the
kangaroo its hop, this is the book for you. This book
also provides a deﬁnitive answer to the proverbial ques-
tion: “which came ﬁrst, the chicken or the egg?” This
scientiﬁcally educational yet entertaining treatment of
ecology, genetics, and evolution is intended for college
students, professional biologists, and anyone interested
in natural history and biodiversity.

Publishing evolution
Dear Evolutionary Biologists
The Society for the Study of Evolution is reviewing the
mode of publication of its highly-regarded international
evolutionary biology journal EVOLUTION.
The Society has a commitment to intellectual and hu-
man diversity - one reﬂection of this is its oﬃce of non-
North American Vice President. In that role, I would
like to ask for your opinions on some issues regarding
publication of evolutionary biology.
Please take a minute to answer the following questions.
Please answer irrespective of your opinion - a random
sample of opinions would be the best. Answers will be
kept conﬁdential, unless you specify otherwise.
Q1. If you have to pay page charges to publish in a good
journal (typically in the order of USD60 per page), how
much of a disincentive relative to other factors is this
to submit to that journal?
Q2. Have you ever decided to not submit to a particular
journal on the basis that you would incur page charges,
and if so, how often (eg rarely, usually etc)?
Q3. Have you ever requested a waiver of page charges
from any journal? Was it granted?Q4. Are you aware that the Society for the Study of
Evolution has low-cost membership fees, and that one
of the beneﬁts of membership is an allowance of 12 fee-
free pages per year if your work is published in EVO-
LUTION?
Q5. Are you a member of the Society for the Study of
Evolution, and if not, why not?
Q6. Have you published in EVOLUTION? How often?
Q7. What is the country/region from which your re-
search funding comes?
Q8. Do your national funding bodies mostly allow ap-
plication for publication charges?
Q9. Do you have any other comments on the subject
of publication of evolutionary biology?
thank you for your time.

Software Geneious 3
SOFTWARE: Geneious 1.0 for organizing and ana-lyzing sequences, alignments, phylogenetics trees and
pubmed abstracts. Geneious 1.0 is free to academics
and the full version has numerous improvements over
the beta (0.9e) that were requested by the commu-
nity, as well as many bug ﬁxes. Among improve-
ments is a faster database and direct access to NCBI
BLAST searches. The sequence, annotation and align-
ment viewer have been improved and now include basic
manipulation such as reverse complement and transla-
tion. We have also added access to the NCBI struc-
ture database as well as providing 3D interactive pro-
tein structure visualization via the open- source package
Jmol. One of the main features of Geneious we received
some good feedback on in the last release was its ability
to continually update your local database once you set
up a query.
Version 1.0 can now be downloaded from
www.geneious.com . Geneious version 1.0 runs on
Mac OS X, Windows and Linux, and allows evolution-
ary biologists to access data more eﬀectively, while
integrating several tasks that are core to evolutionary
biologists, including:
* phylogenetic reconstruction (NJ with bootstrapping)
& tree viewing * multiple & pairwise sequence align-
ment * sequence alignment * faster dot plots * se-
quence viewing, including sequence annotations from
NCBI database * translating from DNA to amino acids
and reverse complements * export to Endnote, Nexus,
Newick, Fasta * import trees, sequences alignments and
bibliographies in a variety of formats * adding user in-
formation and notes to sequences, alignments and trees
* NCBI Blast * 3D protein structure viewing * Fast
local database searching * PDF full text searching of
publications
The process of downloading, sorting and analysing se-
quences has been simpliﬁed, so that you can spend more
time on genuine research. By creating a searchable,
continuously updating local database of sequences, you
can perform more complicated searches and view data
in more detail than NCBI and EBI readily allow.
To encourage community development, we will soon
be publishing a public API for our product on our
website. This means that bioinformatics developers
can write plugins to Geneious. Any developers want-
ing to know more about this should contact us (con-
tact@biomatters.com) for details.

Software JMating
Dear evoldir members:
We wish to announce the new software JMATING (ver
1.0.7; May 2006) able to do a battery of analyses to
study sexual isolation and sexual selection eﬀects from
mating frequency data. The program has a friendly
user windows interface and it is implemented in Java.
The lists of the main features provided are: - It calcu-
lates the less biassed sexual isolation coeﬃcients avail-
able. In one of the former statistics gives a unique sex-
ual isolation estimation for the whole table when more
than two traits are studied. In addition, it also calcu-
lates the classical two trait indexes for all combinations
of the traits being studied. The number of traits being
used is only limited by the memory of the computer.
- It allows to obtain the cross product ﬁtness estima-
tor (W; the maximum likelihood of a qualitative trait
ﬁtness) for sexual selection in male and females sepa-
rately. - It gives the signiﬁcance of all the above in-
dexes by bootstrapping, using laboratory and natural
data sets models. - It also gives the signiﬁcance of the
above eﬀects (sexual selection and sexual isolation by
maximum likelihood methods, as a G test partition for
sexual selection and isolation components. - It allowsthe analysis of PTI, PSI and PSS pair type estimators
for any number of traits (only limited by RAM mem-
ory). - It gives the signiﬁcance of the above coeﬃcients
by bootstrapping and resampling methods using labo-
ratory and natural data sets models.

Software Mesquite1 1
Mesquite 1.1: a modular system for evolutionary anal-
ysis has been released at http://mesquiteproject.org .
This software provides diverse analyses for phylogenetic
and population biology.
There are more than 500 modules in the standard in-
stallation, so we can’t hope to summarize all features
here. Here are some of the basic analyses (* = new to
1.1):
Ancestral state reconstruction: Categorical data
parsimony likelihood *stochastic character mapping
Molecular data parsimony Continuous data parsi-
mony/likelihood landmarks (geometric morphometrics)
Processes of character evolution: Rates: Categorical
data, 1 & 2 parameter models Correlation: Felsenstein’s
contrasts (via PDAP) Pairwise comparison *Pagel’s
1994 method Molecular analysis *Alignment *manual
alignment tools *ClustalW integration Simulations of
sequence evolution (GTR, HKY85, etc.) *Charts of
sequence distances (Jukes Cantor, F81, F84, K2P) Vi-
sualizations of sequence properties Gene tree/species
tree Coalesence simulations Measures of ﬁt deep coa-
lescences *duplications/extinctions Geography phylo-
geographic visualizations (via Cartographer) tests of
population structure Simulations and randomizations
Trees Pure birth process (Yule) Coalescence Reshuﬄing
terminals Random rearrangements Noise to branch
lengths Characters Simulations of evolution DNA mod-
els (HKY85, GTR, etc.) Categorical (1 & 2 pa-
rameter) Continuous (Brownian) Reshuﬄing charac-
ter states Parametric bootstrapping Integration with
PAUP, MrBayes, etc. via Batch Architect Multivari-
ate analysis Principle Components Analysis Evolution-
ary PCA Canonical Variates Analysis Tree comparison
Robinson-Foulds metric (via TSV) Strict consensus (via
TSV) Visualizations of tree space (via TSV) Instabil-
ity of terminal taxa Tree reconstruction Tree Search to
optimize: deep coalescences *duplications/extinctions
other criteria Cluster analysis UPGMA, Single linkage
*Jukes Cantor, F81, F84, K2P
The above list presents features in a simple paradig-
matic way; many other novel analyses can be performed
by combining modules together.
In addition there are many visualizations (tree win-
dows, charts) and utilities for editing and manipulating
data. Some other notable features new to this versionare:
- fusing matrices: you can now merge matrices (e.g.,
three diﬀerent genes) even if each uses diﬀerent taxon
names, into a single matrix
- integration with MrBayes, including export of Mr-
Bayes style ﬁles (composite matrices) and live-updated
reading of MrBayes tree ﬁles as they are being pro-
duced.
- installation for Windows considerably simpliﬁed
- distribution of source code via Subversion repository
Mesquite runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Mac OS 9, and
Linux/Unix.

Software Mosy
Dear EvolDir members,
I am pleased to announce a software that detects recent
selective sweep and estimates its parameters in popu-
lation with varying size.
A long-standing interest in evolutionary biology is to
estimate the rate of adaptive substitution. Footprints
of recent adaptation can be detected by identifying se-
lective sweeps in the genome (in particular, valleys of
reduced polymorphism). The purpose of the software is
to detect these adaptive events in the genome when the
population size is not constant. The basic idea is to set
the neutral demographic scenario as the null hypothesis
in the likelihood ratio test, and the hitchhiking model
under the same scenario as the alternative hypothesis.
The software is available at http://www.zi.biologie.uni-
muenchen.de/˜li/mosy/ Sincerely,

Software SGRunner 2 0 1
SG Runner 2.0.1: A Graphical User Interface for Seq-
Gen
SG Runner is a simple Mac OS X application that pro-
vides a graphical user interface for Seq-Gen, the se-
quence simulation program from Rambaut and Grassly
(2001). SG Runner does not incorporate any code from
Seq-Gen, but instead acts as an intermediary, control-
ling Seq- Gen through a standard graphical interface.
So, instead of typing:
/usr/bin/Seq-Gen -mHKY t2.7 -l1000 -n100 -a.43 -g4
-f.23 .21 .29 . 27 <~/Documents/Simproj/tree.phy
>~/Documents/Simproj/simout.txt
you ﬁll in the model parameters in a graphical form.
This approach provides three potential beneﬁts: 1)
fewer mistakes since the layout for model speciﬁcation
is very similar to PAUP and SG Runner checks that
parameters entered are of the correct type, 2) easier
management of multiple simulations through the built-
in simulation management tools, and 3) broader use of
Seq-Gen by people that may be frustrated by the com-
mand line interface.
SG Runner 2.0.1 is a bug ﬁx release. Users are encour-
aged to download the new release.
SG Runner requires Mac OS X 10.2 or above.

VideoSoftware for LeicaCamera
We need software to record ﬁg wasp behaviour using
a binocular microscope but have been unable to ﬁnd
a suitable package for the hardware we have available.
If anyone has any suggestions they will be gratefully
received.
The microscope we have access to is a Leica MZ6 with
a Leica DFC 280 camera. The camera is connected to
a Mac mini with a Mac OSX 10.4.6 operating system.
We have tried the demo of Leica’s Openlab software,
but it doesn’t work with the DFC280 camera. We get
great real time images on the screen using Leica’s Fire-
cam software, but this does not enable us to capture a
video of what the animals are up to.
Kind regards
Derek.

answers
Many thanks to all who replied to my original post-
ing about capturing real-time moving images on a com-
puter screen. I have included the original posting and
the replies. The solution to the problem was the soft-
ware SnapZpro, available from Ambrosia softwares web-
site.
http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/
This software enables a Mac user to easily record any
activity on their screen as a movie ﬁle. The part of the
screen to be recorded can be easily altered. The price
of the software, $69 US, compares quite favourablyJune 1, 2006 EvolDir 57
with Leicas own product, $1000 U.S., which doesnt
work with the Leica camera we have available anyway.
Unfortunately, it looks like SnapZpro is a Mac only
product and doesnt work with PCs.

Derek, Funny you posted on that. I just tested two
camera’s, one from Leica and the one at this webpage.
And, I ended up buying the Unibrain.
http://www.1394store.com/eshop/-
product.asp?dept%5Fid=59&pf%5Fid=4417
Haven’t used it yet except as demo, but it takes stills
and videos and has great resolution and its own soft-
ware. The Leica software couldn’t get us both capabil-
ities although it has a pretty spiﬀy interface.
On closer reading, I see you don’t want a camera,
just sottware. I don’t know if Unibrain would sell it
separately and whether it would work on your cam-
era....probably not.. Leica does sell separate video soft-
ware for about $1k. But, I think the sampling rate was
low if I remember correctly.I would be interested to know what you come up with.
Sarah Cohen
Hi,
I know a linux package made rather for video surveil-
lance, but capable of interacting with many diﬀerent
cameras and hardware. Maybe its worth to try it -
anyway, I do not know on which port your camera con-
nects to the computer.
It available on http://www.zoneminder.com Good
luck, Wolfgang Arthofer
Hello Derek, I have successfully used iMovie to capture
live video feeds (in my case from a digital video cam-
era. Have you tried this yet? The fact that you can
see it on screen makes me think you can capture it.
You can then export Quicktime movies at lower frame
rates, import them into ImageJ and take various mea-
surements. I have attached the instructions I use for
my undergrads.
-Patrick Lorch
Derek, If you can get video on screen, you could
use Ambrosia Software’s SnapZ Pro to capture
the video. http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/-
snapzprox/ Hope this helps, Joshua Der
Dear Derek,
I have a similar setup (but with a DFC 320 and a PC) in
my lab. However, I do have a Powerbook which I occa-
sionally like to plug in. The setup suggested to me was
to use the standard ﬁrecam streaming and then capture
it with one of the following programs (listed in order of
preference): Snapz Pro BTV Pro Media Capture
I haven’t done this in a few months but, for a time,
I had it working quite well. In any case, I’d be very
interested to hear which solution you ﬁnally decide on.

CornellU ComputationalPopGenet
Postdoctoral position in statistical/computational hu-
man population genetics at Cornell
Carlos Bustamante, Rasmus Nielsen, Simon Tavar´ e,
Manolis Dermitzakis and Andy Clark seek a creative
and energetic postdoctoral fellow to engage in NIH-
funded research on the analysis of genome-wide SNP
genotype data for purposes of identifying associations
with measured phenotypes. We are pursuing a series
of investigations that center around the following four
aims:
1. Our ﬁrst goal is to develop Bayesian classiﬁcation
models to identify genomic regions most likely to harborvariation associated with phenotypic diﬀerences. We
have full genome expression microarray data for the
270 human HapMap samples to serve as a terriﬁc test
bed for these models.
2. The second goal is to quantify the eﬀects of ascertain-
ment bias and departures from neutrality of the marker
variation on association testing. SNPs used in genome-
wide platforms went through an ascertainment process
that gives them a skewed frequency spectrum and lo-
cal population biases, and we need to understand when
and how this makes a diﬀerence in association testing.
3. The third goal is to explore application of data reduc-
tion methods to both the SNP and the phenotype data.
High dimensional regression methods have been devel-
oped over the past 20 years with the goal of identifying
subsets of independent variables that can be dropped
from the model prior to model selection procedures.
The correlation structure of SNPs and the low portion
of variance typically explained by each SNP necessitates
tuning these methods to the problem of genome-wide
association testing.
4. The ﬁnal goal is to assess the power of the associ-
ation tests under a wide variety of violations of model
assumptions.
Our research groups make a lively and stimulating re-
search environment. Facilities include a 101 dual-G5
processor cluster (run by the Cornell group), and ac-
cess to the Cornell Theory Center Velocity Cluster.

terests and contact information for three references as

DrosophilaInnateImmunity
Postdoctoral position - Evolutionary Genomics of In-
nate Immunity at Cornell
Brian Lazzaro and Andy Clark seek an energetic post-
doctoral fellow with experience in Drosophila to engage
in NIH-funded research on the analysis of the evolution
and regulation of the innate immune response. We are
pursuing a series of investigations that center around
the following four aims:60 EvolDir June 1, 2006
1. Analysis of innate immunity as a gene regulatory
network The level of detailed knowledge of the genes
involved in innate immunity is now suﬃcient to be-
gin to investigate evolutionary constraints on this gene
regulatory network. We have accumulated extensive
data quantifying variation in immune-related transcript
abundance over time following challenge with several
pathogen elicitors. We will ﬁt dynamical models of the
immune system as a gene regulatory network, test the
resilience and robustness of the system, and identify
weak points that may be exploited by pathogens.
2. Functional variation and population structure in im-
munity genes Pathogen attack can present a particu-
larly strong, population-speciﬁc form of natural selec-
tion. The degree and pattern of population structur-
ing in innate immunity genes relative to non-immunity
genes will be determined from a global survey of SNP
genotypes. We will ﬁt population genetic models to
assess whether observed population subdivision in in-
nate immunity genes is attributable to heterogeneity
in selective pressures across populations, and test for
diﬀerences in resistance to a series of pathogens to de-
termine whether pathogen diversity may be responsible
for maintenance of host polymorphism.
3. Physiological and ﬁtness trade-oﬀs to launching an
immune response The fact that organisms do not simply
maintain a constant state of active defense, but instead
induce speciﬁc responses only after septic infection, sug-
gests that there are physiological or ﬁtness costs to
maintaining a constitutive state of immune activation.
We are starting a series of experiments to quantify these
costs and their variation among Drosophila lines.
4. Comparative genomic analysis of multiple
Drosophila species Detailed comparative analysis of
the innate immune pathway across the 13 Drosophila
species for which there is genome-wide data is revealing
which genes face the strongest evolutionary pressures.
These genes are also particularly amenable to analy-
sis of evolutionary divergence in regulation, and align-
ments of 5’ regulatory regions will is identifying genes
with unusual rates and patterns of inferred regulatory
divergence.
Our research groups enjoy a lively and stimulating re-
search environment. Facilities include an outstanding
DNA Core facility for sequencing and genotyping, a 101
dual-G5 Xserve computer cluster (run by our groups),
and. Please email your resume, statement of research
interests and contact information for three references

TreePopulationDynamicsModeling
We have a post-doc position available immediately,
or as soon as possible, to a non French citizen, both
granted by INRA (National Institute of Agronomic Re-
search, Research department “Forest, Grassland and
Aquatic Ecology”) for 6 months and by CIRAD (Centre
for International Cooperation in Agronomic Research
for Development, forestry department), for 6 months
or more.
To study the eﬀect of management on tree populations,
we have developed demo-genetics models for several
species, in temperate as well as tropical forests. Cur-
rently, the most achieved model is available for a trop-
ical species - highly harvested in French Guyana - the
angelique (Dicorynia guianensis). This work was pos-
sible thanks to many data available on the life cycle of
the species (from seed production to tree mortality) andJune 1, 2006 EvolDir 61
on gene ﬂow (with the genotyping of reproducing and
young trees in a 40 ha stand). The model was imple-
mented on the platform CAPSIS (Croissance d’Arbres
en Peuplement avec Simulation d’Itin´ eraires Sylvicoles
/ Computer-Aided Projection of Strategies In Silvicul-
ture, see http://coligny.free.fr/ ) developed by INRA.
The ﬁrst simulations indicate that repeated harvesting
on a 40 years cycle reduce regularly the number of trees
but the genetic diversity remains constant.
During this post doc project, we would like: 1) to eval-
uate the validity of our ﬁrst conclusions: (i) by using
a sensitivity analysis of the model (ii)by studying how
the hypotheses are going on with the model. 2) to com-
pare the results obtained for angelique with oak (and
Quercus petraea, sessile oak, in particular).
The post-doc candidate will ﬁrst be working on the
CAPSIS module for angelique to complete the study
and to get familiar with the tool. She/he will improve
some parts of the model, in particular seed and pollen
ﬂow dispersal description. An experimental plan for
simulations will be set up, to measure the sensitivity
of the model to the diﬀerent entry parameters. The
Quercus module will then be improved. Some simula-
tions will be performed to study the impact of various
forest management scenarios on the demo-genetic be-
haviour of oaks. Results will be compared to those
obtained in angelique, to stress out diﬀerences, and to
explain them. The goal would be to build a sensitiv-
ity analysis on species caracteristics, by exploring how
modiﬁcations of these caracteristics will aﬀect simula-
tions.
The candidate should have qualiﬁcation in computer
programming, forestry, modeling. The work will be
ﬁrst located in Montpellier, a stay in Bordeaux is also
possible. The monthly salary is around 2000 euros.
Please rapidly send applications, including CV, publi-
cation list, and major publications (if available also ad-
dresses of referees and statement of research interests)

GifsurYvette SexChromosomeDrive
A one-year Post-doctoral position in Genetics, spon-
sored by the Centre National de la Recherche Sci-
entiﬁque, is available at the Laboratoire Evolution,
G´ enomes et Sp´ eciation, at Gif sur Yvette (near Paris),
France. The successful applicant will join the group of
Catherine Montchamp-Moreau, working on the molec-
ular basis and the evolutionary history of sex chromo-
some drive. The project aims at identifying the genes
or genetic elements responsible for “/sex-ratio/” drive,
a type of segregation distortion occurring in males of
drosophila. <>/Sex-ratio/ segregation distorters are
linked to the X chromosome and prevent the produc-
tion of Y-bearing sperm. The loss of Y sperm is related
to the inability of the Y chromosome sister-chromatids
to separate properly during the second meiotic divi-
sion (1). The trait was recently mapped to two small
regions located about 150kb apart on the X chromo-
some of /Drosophila simulans/. Each of them contains
an element required for /sex-ratio/ drive (2). Several
approaches should be used to identify the distorter el-
ements: (i) search for diﬀerences in gene organization
and DNA sequence between /sex-ratio/ and wild-type
X chromosomes, (ii) search for qualitative or quanti-
tative diﬀerences in testis expression of genes between
/sex-ratio /and wild-type males, (iii) use of transgenes,
to determine whether the putative candidate(s) do in-
duce segregation distortion. The laboratory is well
equipped with PCR and sequencing facilities.
The applicant must have a strong background in ge-
netics and molecular biology, including a real expertise
in studying gene expression. A solid knowledge of the
genetic control of meiosis or technical skills in transge-
nesis will be appreciated.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS IN COMPUTA-
TIONAL EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENTAL BI-
OLOGY IN THE EISEN LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY
I am seeking two talented computational postdoctoral
fellows with experience and deep interest in evolution
to use the now twelve sequenced Drosophila genomes,
and a wealth of experimental data we are generating,
to study the evolution of gene expression and gene reg-
ulation. The members of my lab have been employ-
ing a combination of computational and experimental
genomics techniques to characterize gene regulation in
developing Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We are
are systematically generating in vivo (ChIP-chip) and
in vitro (SELEX) binding data on all of the transcrip-
tion factors involved in early (pre-gastrulation) pattern
formation. We are also producing a three-dimensional
atlas of gene expression patterns in the embryo that
will include the protein and RNA expression patterns
of these factors and their targets. All of these methods
are now being extended to the other Drosophila species
to generate the ideal dataset for a detailed, quantita-
tive study of the evolution of gene expression and regu-
lation. These positions are fully funded by grants from
the National Institutes of Health and are open to citi-
zens of any country.

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR Genetics and Behavior
of Social Insects
The Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at
UC Irvine is currently seeking one or more Postdoctoral
Scholar(s) in the laboratory of Dr. Neil Tsutsui.
We are seeking Postdoctoral Scholar(s) to study the ge-
netics, behavior and social structure of social insects.
Previous work has focused on the charming, yet in-66 EvolDir June 1, 2006
vasive, Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). In this
species, genetic changes during introduction have al-
tered individual behavior and, in turn, the social or-
ganization of introduced populations. These changes
have contributed to the Argentine ant’s invasive suc-
cess by promoting the formation of massive “super-
colonies” in the introduced range. Publications from
previous research can be downloaded from: http://-
tsutsuilab.bio.uci.edu/ . The Postdoctoral Scholar(s)
will have opportunities to contribute to ongoing ge-
netic, behavioral and biochemical research on Argentine
ants, as well as work on other projects related to the
lab’s core interests in behavioral, molecular and chem-
ical ecology.
The successful applicant(s) must have a strong back-
ground in molecular techniques, population genetics
and data analysis, and previous experience in behav-
ioral ecology is desired. Salary will be commensurate
with experience; generous beneﬁts are included.
Applicants should submit a curriculum vita, a brief
statement of research interests, copies of relevant publi-
cations and/or manuscripts, and the name, address and
phone number of two references to the email or postal
address below. Review of candidates and applications
will begin May 22, 2006

Two Postdoc positions in molecular evolutionary biol-
ogy are available in the lab of Axel Meyer in the De-
partment of Biology at the University of Konstanz, in
Germany. The evolutionary biology group is an inter-
national group of students and postdocs that consists
of about 20 people from 10 diﬀerent countries. The
language in the lab is English.
We are looking for energetic postdocs who are inter-
ested in speciation, molecular evolution, bioinformat-
ics/genomics and/or evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy. The speciﬁc research projects involve research on
the patterns of relationships and population genetics
of cichlid ﬁshes as well as the discovery and functional
characterization of genes underlying the diversiﬁcation
of cichlids in Africa and in Nicaragua.
The great lakes in East Africa house some of the worlds
most diverse freshwater ecosystems. Lakes Victoria,
Malawi and Tanganyika are particularly well-knownfor their adaptive radiations of hundreds of endemic
species of cichlid ﬁshes. We are interested in under-
standing speciation, phylogeography, molecular evolu-
tion and molecular phylogenetics of these cichlid ﬁsh
assemblages. We also want to identify and charac-
terize the function of genes that are involved in the
phenotypic diversiﬁcation and presumably speciation
of cichlid ﬁshes. Several molecular biological, “devo-
evo” and genomic approaches, including candidate gene
approaches, DNA-chip technology, characterization of
ESTs, in situ hybridization in cichlids and transgenics
in zebraﬁsh are used to address these questions. We
are also interested in evolutionary genomic questions
and the evolution of novel gene functions after gene
and genome duplications.
Some recent publications of the lab include: Verheyen
et al. (2003). The origin of the superﬂock of cichlid
ﬁshes from Lake Victoria, East Africa. Science 300:
325-329. Salzburger et al. (2005). Out of Tanganyika:

Funding is available for at least 2 years. Postdoc
salaries (BATII/a pay scale) are approximately 45 to
50,000 Euros annually, (depending on marital status,
age, etc.) before deductions for taxes, health insurance
and retirement contributions.
The positions are open immediately. The review and
invitation of applicants will begin at the end of June

EMBO Practical Course on “Molecular approaches
to Evolution and Development” http://www-
db.embl.de/jss/EmblGroupsOrg/conf 45 in coop-
eration with ZOONET (Marie Curie Research Training
Network ) http://www.zoonet.eu.com/ This course
is aimed at PhD students and postdoctoral fellows
working in the ﬁeld of Evolution of Development (Evo
Devo). The major focus of the course will be on recent
progress in techniques that facilitate the analysis
of gene expression and function in non-conventional
model organisms, with teachers that have been
spearheading technical developments.
Post-transcriptional gene silencing (RNA interference,
RNAi) is a reverse genetics approach that allows the
fast functional analysis of a given gene. RNAi exper-
iments will be conducted in beetles, crustaceans, and
spiders, but also in other ecdysozoan and lophotro-
chozoan models. During the course participants are
encouraged to transfer available RNAi techniques to
their animal model of choice.
The recent establishment of broadly applicable ge-
netic transformation systems has been the second ma-
jor breakthrough for functional analysis in a variety
of non-conventional animal models. Transgenesis al-
lows stage and site-speciﬁc expression of promoter con-
structs to express ﬂuorescent proteins, or for gain- or
loss-of-function analysis. Heterologous transformation
into various species allows the comparative study of cis-
regulatory elements. We will teach these techniques in
order to facilitate transfer into additional animal mod-
els, giving an up-to-date survey of vectors and integra-
tion techniques currently available.
Single and double wholemount in situ hybridisation
techniques are prerequisite for various aspects of Evo-
Devo research, for example the comparison of cell types.
We will focus on recent technical improvements such as
double ﬂuorescent in situ hybridisation protocols to be
tried in diﬀerent organisms. Again, participants are en-
couraged to transfer techniques to their model of choice.
A second focus of the course will be on practical and
theoretical aspects of analysis and interpretation of the
phylogenies and of fossil data. This part of the course
will impart practical knowledge of molecular phylogeny
reconstruction and the uses to which this can be put.
We will also cover the fundamentals of palaeontology72 EvolDir June 1, 2006
with the aim of integrating fossil data into comparative
evolutionary studies.

This is the ﬁrst call for participation in a workshop on
SIMULATION MODELS OF TREE POPULATION
GENETICS
October 4th, 2006. Alcal´ a de Henares (Madrid, Spain)
This workshop is included in the IUFRO conference
“Population Genetics and Genomics of Forest Trees:
from Gene Function to Evolutionary Dynamics and
Conservation”, to be held in Alcal´ a de Henares, Oc-
tober 1-6, 2006 ( http://www.genfor2006.fgua.es )
Attendance to this workshop requires registering to the
IUFRO conference.
Attendants are encouraged to present their work on
simulation models of tree population genetics in this
4-hour workshop, which is aimed at oﬀering a practical
overview of the role and technical features of up-to-date
simulation models in tree population genetic analyses.
Talks (15-20 min + 10-15 min for discussion) should
deal with topics not easily addressable via experimental
or analytical approaches, should stress methodological
aspects, and should be structured in a didactic way.
Suggested topics include:
* Spatio-temporal demographic stochasticity and popu-
lation genetic processes * Mating system evolution, hy-
bridization and speciation * Implementation of quanti-
tative traits under selection in individual-based models
* Interaction between gene ﬂow and selective processes
(in a changing environment) * Selective consequences
of the genetic architecture on inbreeding depression and
adaptive variation in trees * Impact of linkage among
adaptive genes and/or with neutral markers. Modelling
of hitchhiking * Transgene escape risk assessment * Pre-
dictive models in forest management and conservation
genetics
Priority will be given to contributions combining de-
mographic, reproductive and selective processes in spa-
tially explicit context, accounting realistically for life
history traits of trees.
Contributors should submit an abstract before May
31 through the IUFRO conference website ( http://-
www.genfor2006.fgua.es ), indicating in the ﬁrst line
“Contribution for the Simulation Models Workshop”.

*Objective:* To provide training in conceptual and
practical aspects of data analysis for the conservation
genetics of natural and managed populations. Empha-
sis will be on interpretation of output from recent novel
statistical approaches and software programs. The
course also will allow daily discussions among young
researchers and top-researchers to help develop the
next generation of conservation geneticists, and to iden-
tify developments needed to improve data analysis ap-
proaches. This course will mainly cover analysis of al-
lele frequency data (not DNA sequence data), includ-
ing coalescent, Bayesian, approximate Bayesian, and
likelihood-based approaches.
*Who should apply:* Ph.D. students, post-docs, and
population biologists with a background of at least one
semester university-level course in population genetics
and a course in population ecology. Applicants must
have a basic background in population genetic data
analysis, including testing for Hardy-Weinberg propor-
tions and gametic disequilibrium. Participation will be
limited to 25 people allowing eﬃcient instruction with
hands-on computer exercises during the course. Pri-
ority will be given to persons with their own data to
analyze (for example graduate students near the end of
their degree program). * *

Live and do research for 16 weeks at Friday Har-
bor Laboratories, the world-renowned University of
Washington marine lab on San Juan Island, 75 miles
northwest of Seattle.
The Friday Harbor Labs oﬀer intensive, full-time re-
search training experiences to qualiﬁed undergraduates
and post-baccalaureates from any college or university.
Teams of students each work on one focused research
problem guided by a group of faculty, postdoctoral and
graduate student mentors. Students selected for par-
ticipation receive ﬁnancial support to defray costs for
room and board at FHL and tuition charged by Uni-
versity of Washington.
For the ﬁrst time, FHL is oﬀering one research appren-
ticeship on a semester schedule, with a greater unit load
to accommodate students from institutions based on a
semester OR quarter system. Students will earn 20
quarter-units (approximately 13-15 semester units, de-pending on your home institutions rules).
Course Description
Marine benthic ecosystems are notorious for exhibiting
extreme environmental heterogeneity over small spatial
scales. Over scales of meters to kilometers, organisms
may encounter signiﬁcant diﬀerences in environmental
conditions, such as emersion times, wave exposure, and
community composition. This heterogeneity presents a
challenge to marine organisms because traits that al-
low an individual to succeed in one environment may
be detrimental in others. Local adaptation and pheno-
typic plasticity are common responses to environmental
heterogeneity. In turn, dispersal, which inﬂuences how
frequently individuals encounter variability within or
between generations, shapes these adaptive responses.
In this course, apprentices will investigate how marine
populations balance local adaptation, phenotypic plas-
ticity, and dispersal to counteract the challenges of liv-
ing in a spatially heterogeneous environment. A pri-
mary objective of the course is to train students in both
experimental and molecular approaches to marine ecol-
ogy. Through lectures, readings, and discussions, as
well as ﬁeld excursions and demonstration labs, stu-
dents will gain hands-on knowledge of: marine ecology
and the natural history of the San Juan Islands, exper-
imental design, basic techniques in molecular ecology,
and current ecological and evolutionary theory of en-
vironmental heterogeneity. The primary focus of the
course will be independent research projects designed
and conducted by each student

InstructionsJune 1, 2006 EvolDir 77
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
