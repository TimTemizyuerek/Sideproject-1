{>http://www.senckenberg.de/dgs2012 <{
The conference theme is \The Past, Present and Fu-
ture of Mammalian Diversity", and hence all topics in
Mammalian Biology are covered in a modern and multi-
disciplinary atmosphere. There will be three days of
conference with talks and poster sessions, divided into
the (non-exclusive) topics:
- past (palaeontology, ancient DNA, phylogeny, phylo-
geography, evolution ...) - present (population struc-
ture and distribution, behaviour, physiology, morphol-
ogy, current policy, other open topics ...) - future (con-
servation, policy making, predictive modelling, climate
change, evolution again ...)
We have invited three plenary speakers to cover and
introduce cutting-edge research in each of these groups
of topics:
- Michael Hofreiter (http://www.york.ac.uk/biology/-
research/ecology-evolution/michael-hofreiter/) - Phil
Stephens (http://www.dur.ac.uk/philip.stephens/-welcome.htm) - Herbert H.T. Prins (http://-

First Call for Abstracts and Participation
Meeting on Advances and Challenges of RNA-seq Anal-
ysis
Halle (Saale), 20-22 June 2012
The tremendous pace at which sequencing technologies
have been developed over the last years has triggered
a plethora of new research projects that were unthink-
able a decade ago. Examples are the 1000 Genomes
Project, the Genome 10K Project, the Human Mi-
crobiome Project, or the Plant 1KP Project. Next-
generation sequencing technologies have not only led to
incredible advances, but also to great challenges, and
our goal is to bring together researchers from dier-
ent elds of science to discuss these topics in a stimu-
lating environment at Martin Luther University Halle-
Wittenberg.
We would like to invite abstracts for talks and posters
on advances and challenges of RNA sequencing, both
experimental and computational, from both users and
developers of novel techniques. The meeting will be fo-
cused on plant transcriptomics, specically on owering
time control, but otherwise ranging from small to long
RNAs, from non-coding to coding RNAs, from model
plants to crop plants. Despite the focus on plant tran-
scriptomics, contributions to advances and challenges
in bacterial, fungal, or animal RNA-seq analyses are
highly welcome.

Articial Life 13 The Thirteenth International Confer-
ence on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems
\Evolution in Action"July 19-22, 2012, Michigan State University East Lans-
ing, Michigan, USA
www.alife13.org/ You are invited to participate to the
upcoming Thirteenth International Articial Life Con-
ference. Please forward this call responsibly.
I. OVERVIEW It is a great pleasure for the BEACON
Center for the Study of Evolution in Action at Michigan
State University to host the 13th International Arti-
cial Life Conference. Articial life (ALife) refers to the
synthesis and simulation of living systems as these oc-
cur in nature and also to possible alternative life forms
and concepts that may not have occurred in natural
evolution-that is, not only in \life-as-we-know-it", but
also \life-as-it-might-be". ALife research may use not
only biochemical models, but also computer models and
robotics. The Articial Life conference is held every
other year under the auspices of the International Soci-
ety for Articial Life (ISAL), alternating with the Eu-
ropean Conference on Articial Life.
This year's major conference theme is \Evolution in
Action." Life is shaped by evolutionary processes, and
ALife models are a powerful way to investigate and uti-
lize this key characteristic of living systems. We encour-
age submissions by biologists as well as by computer
scientists and engineers, especially interdisciplinary pa-
pers that explore the many ways that evolution and
articial life research intersect. Other tracks this year
include Behavior & Intelligence, Collective Dynamics,
Synthetic Biology, and The Humanities and ALife. See
the list of tracks below for examples of topics that may
fall under these headings.

The nal program of the following international meet-
ing is now available and registrations are open!
Revisiting the 'Negrito' Hypothesis, An Inter-
Disciplinary Synthesis of the Prehistory of South-
east Asia www.mnhn.fr/mnhn/ecoanthropologie/-
paris2012negrito/negrito index.html What: Anthro-
pology When: September 3-5, 2012 Where: The
National Museum of Natural History, Paris, France
The 'negrito' hypothesis was one of the rst evolution-
ary paradigms to emerge from the nascent academic
discipline of Anthropology in the late 19th Century.
It posits that various indigenous groups throughout is-
land and mainland Southeast Asia have a shared pheno-
type - dened by short but gracile stature, dark com-
plexion, and tightly curled hair - due to common de-
scent from a putative ancestral population, represent-
ing a pre-agricultural substrate of humanity in the re-gion. The meeting to be held in Paris 3-5th Septem-
ber 2012 is designed to revisit the 'negrito' hypothesis
within an inter-disciplinary framework involving con-
tributions from Archaeology, Biological Anthropology,
Cultural Anthropology, Physical Anthropology, Social
Anthropology, Linguistics, and Population Genetics.
Methodological approaches will be both synchronic and
diachronic, and a comparative approach is actively en-
couraged. The meeting will present the latest research
available and explore where there is a common frame-
work between the dierent disciplines.
This event will be open for attendance by other in-
terested scholars working in the elds of Anthropology
(Social, Cultural and Biological), Archaeology, History,
Linguistics, and Population Genetics of Southeast Asia.

THEME AND SCOPE
The continuing advance of DNA sequencing technol-
ogy has produced an avalanche of genome sequence
and genome structural information across the evolu-
tionary spectrum. Transforming that information into
biological knowledge requires creative and innovative
new computational and statistical methods for compar-
ative genomics.
The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Comparative Ge-
nomics aims to provide the premier forum for new com-
putational developments applied to all aspects of com-
parative genomics. We solicit contributions on topics
including comparison of genome structure and organi-
zation, genome function, and evolution. We particu-
larly encourage contributions that use new computa-
tional methods to acquire new insight into biological
processes. Advances in computational theory are wel-
come, though all submissions should include genome-
scale analyses informed by comparative data.
All peer-reviewed and accepted RECOMB-CG
manuscripts will be published in a supplement to BMC
Bioinformatics as open-access, author-subsidized,
articles.
Specic topics of interest include but are not limited
to:
. Gene and genome duplication . Gene family evolution
. Genome structural variation . Algorithms for compar-
ative genomics . Genome rearrangements . Ancestral
genome reconstruction . Multiple genome alignment
. Genome sequence comparison . Modeling genome
evolution . Comparative genomics for genome anno-
tation . Gene tree reconciliation . Species and gene
tree inference . Comparative metagenomics . Compar-
ative genomics linked to proteomics, metabolomics, and
other ~omic data . Comparative genomics and gene ex-
pression and regulation . Applications of comparative
genomic methods

*Genetic pedigrees and individual trait variability: eco-
logical and evolutionary consequences for wild sh pop-
ulations*
Recent advances in genetic data analysis have provided
the tools so that evolutionary processes in wild popu-
lations can be inferred from molecular data. Molecular
based pedigrees can be used to estimate reproductive
success of individuals or phenotypes and for quantita-
tive genetic analysis. The resulting information on her-
itability of ecologically signicant life history traits or
behaviours is crucial in accurately predicting responses
to selection and is therefore a key element of evolution-
ary models. Here we will use sophisticated maximum-
likelihood and Bayesian approaches for parentage anal-
ysis (e.g. molecular pedigree reconstruction) to produce
eld based heritability estimates. Important aspects of
population structure such as geographic or behavioural
barriers to migration to gene ow between subpopula-
tions and the eective population size, can be inferred
from these molecular data and as such provide both a
framework for understanding micro-evolutionary pro-
cesses and key information for the validation of evolu-
tionary models.
In this PhD, we will use a riverine pike /Esox lucius/
population from the River Frome as a model for our
predictions. The River Frome is a chalk stream with
a total length of approximately 15km where pike are
present. Since no freshwater connections exist to other
river catchments it constitutes a closed system regard-
ing non-migratory freshwater sh populations. The
core investigation area covers approximately 4km of
river length (33% of the available pike habitat) includ-
ing seven discrete spawning sites. Data on growth, diet
and sampling location are available for a large propor-
tion of /E. Lucius,/ whose population has been studied
on the river since 1976. These data have enabled quan-
titative measures to be made of population changes in
terms of abundance, age structure, mortality, individ-
ual growth and diet, but a collection of tissue materialalso provide the opportunity to obtain genetic data and
link them on individual life-history traits, providing an
important temporal component for the project.
Candidates will be expected to have a strong ecological
and mathematical background, and have a good the-
oretical and practical understanding of population ge-
netics. Note the research will require an initial period
of laboratory work for developing the genetic compo-
nent of the model where full training will be provided.
This is a fully-funded, full time studentship supported
by the Natural Environment Research Council. For fur-
ther details, please contact the supervisory team of Dr
R Britton, Prof R Stillman and Prof Rudy Gozlan.
Closing dates for applications: 30 ^th of May

Descriptions and objectives
Background - Mammals display a high dental diver-
sity in terms of number and complexity of teeth. This
diversity attests of the inuence of several parameters
including diet and suggests a mammalian morphospace
on which shape changes are possible in every direction.
However, morphological changes within lineages seem
to be constrained. Developmental processes producing
the phenotypic expression of genetic variation are under
natural selection. Favouring or limiting some directions
of change in the morphospace, these processes will mod-
ify the evolutionary capacity on the short and long time
scales. These constraints can inuence the diversity ofa clade (at a macroevolutionay level), forcing the accu-
mulation of new species in one peculiar direction of the
morphospace. In the dental raw the eruption of teeth
follows an iterative developmental model in which in-
teractions between teeth are controlled and lead to a
nal dental phenotype. Within teeth themselves, inter-
actions occur between cusps following the same itera-
tions and dening tooth morphology (number, position
and shape of cusps). Some recent works showed that
small modications of cusp interactions can imply large
modications at the tooth scale, and for instance the
development of new cusps.
Objectives - This subject will focus on two dierent
mammal groups (rodents and primates) at dierent
scales (population, lineages, clades). Complementary
approaches will be addressed by both groups. Rodents
display a reduced variation of the dental formula but
a high diversity of molar form. In primates, the ma-
jor part of variation occurs on the number of teeth and
number of cusps on each tooth rather than on their
shape. The main goal of this project is to understand
the cusp interactions and their consequences on dental
formula and teeth complexity (gains or losses of cusps
and teeth). These variations of complexity will be anal-
ysed in the historic and evolutionary frameworks of the
groups, and of the biotic (size, diet^ a) and abiotic pa-
rameters.
National and international context- The EPHE
-Pal eobiodiversit e et  evolution andUMR
uB/CNRS 6282 Biog eosciences laboratories have na-
tional and international recognition for their knowledge
and skills in form analysis. The evolution of dental
morphology in rodents and especially Arvicolinae is an
historic and major topic of the EPHE laboratory since
it establishment. These last years, people from the lab-
oratory developed international collaborations on Evo-
Devo themes on teeth.
Details:
- The duration of the fellowship is 3 years if accepted
by the Doctoral School.
- The position is open until the 13th of june and the
oral presentation will take place on the 3rd and 4th of
july 2012 in Paris.

ETH Zurich AnimalBehvaiourEvol
PhD Position: Quantitative study of dynamical animal
social networks
At the Chair of Systems Design, we use methods from
complex systems theory to understand the structure
and dynamics of social systems, ranging from animal
groups to human social networks. One of our areas of
interest is the study of evolving social networks, and
the link between the formation of social bonds and in-
dividual payo.
We are starting a 3-year project in collaboration with
the Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the University
of Zurich to study the incentives of social interaction
and social bond formation. The project will combine
the analysis of a large data set on social interactions
and individual tness in a population of wild house mice
with formal models of network formation in economic
and social systems. It will also involve experimental
manipulation of the social network to study its robust-
ness and adaptivity to structural changes.
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate to
join interdisciplinary research group in charge of this
project. Whilst we are looking for people with a quan-
titative background in order to eciently conduct data
analysis and deal with formal models, the candidate will
also interact extensively with researchers from the eld
of behavioural and evolutionary biology. As such, the
candidate is expected to have a keen interest beyond
the boundaries of his/her original eld.
The candidate will have the opportunity to integrate
in a lively team of scientists with various backgrounds
(from economics to computer science), and maintain
close collaboration with biologists from the partner in-
stitution. Occasional help with eld work near Zurich
may be required. The position requires strong commu-
nication skills and uent English, written and spoken.We oer excellent working conditions in a motivated
team, a competitive salary (according to the ETH
Zurich salary scale), and innovative research in close
collaboration with leading institutions all over the
world.
Applicants are asked to send their curriculum vitae, a
list of their publications (if applicable), names of at
least two references, and a short overview of their re-
search interests (all in PDF les and in English) to Ms.
Rahel Dulik, rdulik@ethz.ch
For specic inquiries, Prof. Frank Schweitzer
(fschweitzer@ethz.ch) should be contacted.
The candidate is expected to start in July or August
2012 (exible starting date). We expect applications at
the latest by May 20, 2012. If no suitable candidate is
found at this date, the position will be remain open for
a second round of interviews at a later date.

PhD student position: Evidence for balancing selection
at immunity genes in Drosophila
We are searching for a highly motivated PhD candi-
date to work on detecting signatures of natural selection
on the genomic scale using next-generation sequencing
data. The successful applicant will make use of popula-
tion genomics data which has become available over the
recent years for Drosophila melanogaster (e.g. http:/-
/www.dpgp.org) in order to uncover genomic regions
that have been aected by natural selection. The focus
will lie on genes involved in immune related processes
which are thought to be governed by complex modes
of selection such as balancing selection. The applicant
will use statistical tests based on population genetics
theory to distinguish between genomic regions evolving
under neutrality and those where selection might have
shaped patterns of DNA polymorphism.
The ideal candidate should have a Masters degree (or
equivalent) in biology or bioinformatics with a strong
background in population genetics and evolution. Since
the majority of the project consists of large scale DNA
sequence data analysis the candidate should have ade-
quate computer programming and/or scripting skills to
handle such kind of data. Additionally, some wet lab
work (Sanger sequencing, qRT-PCR) might be required
to verify results obtained from sequence analysis.
The research will be carried out in the lab of Prof. Dr.
Wolfgang Stephan. The lab is part of the Section of
Evolutionary Biology at the LMU Munich which is a
strong, interactive group of theoreticians and experi-
mentalists working on both plant and animal systems.
We have a very international group and the everyday
working language is English. The department is housed
in a new, state-of-the-art BioCenter on the University
of Munich High-Tech campus. More information is
available on the web at: http://evol.bio.lmu.de The
position (TV-L 13 65%) is funded by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft for three years and will be
available starting August 2012.

POPULATION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION OF

http://www.vas.univ-rennes1.fr/en/ Socio-economic
and scientic context
The sudden advances of molecular biology in the last
thirty years allowed biologists to extensively test, suc-
cessfully use and improve the conceptual framework
of population genetics. Regarding partially asexual
species, population genetics allowed biologists to qual-
itatively identify some sexual or asexual events within
populations and to disentangle sexual from asexual
lines using empirical criteria. However, because of the
lack of adapted theoretical model, biologists cannot
compare the observed evolutionary patterns of these
species to theoretical referential predictions, as they
commonly do to study the ecology and the evolution
of sexual species. We cannot content on current meth-
ods as they mainly rely on qualitative expertise. We are
developing adapted models that take into account forthe specic genetic functioning of such species. These
models will enable non-biased predictions and reliable
biological inference methods from eld genetic data.
Assomptions and questions
Questions prompting this project are 1) what are the
quantitative eects of partial asexuality on the expected
gen-etic/-omic diversity and its structure in metapop-
ulations when those ones undergo selective pressures?
and 2) Do the joint eects of the evolutionary forces
and this mating mode result in distinctive genomic pat-
terns from which biologists may infer the current and
past evolution of such species? The PhD student will
answer by completing a population genetics model ded-
icated to partially asexual organisms so it takes into
account for selective processes. This model will allow
to study the evolutionary specicities and the genomic
patterns left by of such functioning, and to propose
some inference methods. Our model without selection
has already shown that evolution of partially asexual
species diverges from pure sexual and asexual species.
The main steps of the thesis
The work will consist in extending a mathematical
model by formalizing the selective processes applied on
genotypes. This step will complete the integration of all
evolutionary processes in a population genetics model
adapted to partially asexual species that has been de-
veloped with the appropriate formalism. The model
will be included in optimized computation algorithms
(coll. Symbiosis team, IRISA, Rennes). The model
outputs will be analysed and confronted to simulation
results, biological knowledge and experimental data al-
ready obtained by the host team, the partners of the
ANR (the collaborative grant that fund the PhD ex-
penses) and a scientic network. Then, the PhD stu-
dent will explore the trends of his quantitative predic-
tions, identify the characteristic eects of partial asexu-
ality on population genetics indices under selection and
participate in providing new descriptive indices adapted
to such species (Coll. S.Arnaud-Haond, Ifremer, Brest
). He will participate in the development of quantita-
tive inference methods to identify forces and eective
rates of asexuality under which genomes have evolved.
Finally, the PhD student will reinterpret the historical
signicance of asexuality in the evolutionary histories
of varied organisms. According to the student inter-
ests, our lab performs global surveys of some partially
asexual species of aphids and whole genome functional
and evolutionary analyses. If interested, the PhD stu-
dent will have the opportunity to collaborate to these
others works to open up on eld, bioinformatics and lab
works.

UCologne HymenopteraMolEvolPhD position - molecular evolution of sex determining
genes in social hymenoptera
(University of Cologne, Institute of Genetics)
*Application deadline: 20. Mai 2012*
* *
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD candidate to
study the population dynamic and molecular evolution
of sex determining genes in social hymenoptera (honey
and bumble bees). Understanding the evolutionary
forces and processes that have led to the fascinating
(single locus) sex determining system in these bees will
contribute to elucidate general principles in evolution.
Sex determination in the honey bee /Apis mellifera/ is
governed by heterozygosity at a single locus harbour-
ing the /complementary sex determiner/ (/csd/) gene,
which arose by gene duplication prior honey bee diver-
gence. Bees heterozygous at /csd/ are females, whereas
homozygotes and hemizygotes (haploid individuals) are
males. Diploid males occur when /csd/ is homozygous
and are lethal in /Apis mellifera/. Rare alleles thus
have a selective advantage, are seldom lost by the ef-
fect of genetic drift, and are maintained over extended
periods of time when compared with neutral polymor-
phisms.
The ideal candidate should have a Masters degree (or
equivalent degree) with a strong background in pop-
ulation genetics, including excellent skills in molec-
ular lab work and major interest in bioinformatics.
Genome data from several honey and bumble bees
will be available for future research projects. We of-
fer a stimulating and dynamic working environment
and excellent research facilities in my recently estab-
lished independent research group as Heisenberg fel-
low. Latest publications (PNAS; Nature, PlosBiol)
can be found under http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/-

of Copenhagen. The positions will be jointly super-
vised by Katrine Worsaae, University of Copenhagen
and Andreas Hejnol, Uni Sars Centre, Norway. Dead-
line for applications is June 11, 2012. The scholar-
ships will address the origin of central body designs
through detailed studies of, microscopic, complex an-
imals of the lesser-studied spiralian lineages. Hereby
we seek answers to central questions such as: Was
the last common spiralian ancestor relatively large and
complex as annelids and mollusks? Or was it micro-
scopic consisting of low number of cells only? How
complex and regionalized is the brain of microscopic
animals? The PhD projects are expected to provide
new scientic insight into the detailed structure, devel-
opment, and evolution of central characters in selected
spiralian meiofaunal taxa. Transcriptomes of these taxa
are either in progress or will be generated during the
project. The projects will combine the disciplines of
advanced microscopy and immunochemistry (histology,
TEM, CLSM, 3D reconstructions) with studies of gene
expression patterns. Body designs and organ systems
of interest could be e.g., the brain, sensory structures,

Project 2: \Peri-domestic wildlife in urban Nairobi:
ecology and epidemiological role in zoonotic pathogen
emergence"
We are seeking a biologist/ecologist, preferably with a
relevant Masters level degree, with quantitative skills,
and in particular an interest in the epidemiology of
pathogen transmission. The student would be regis-
tered at the University of Edinburgh, and would also
be part of collaborators research groups at the Univer-
sity of Nairobi, the International Livestock Research
Institute (both in Nairobi, Kenya) and the University
of Liverpool. This studentship would involve extensive
periods of time in the eld in Kenya.
Urbanized environments in Africa are melting pots of
activity and interaction: the wealthy live alongside the
poor; livestock live alongside people; human and live-
stock waste is poorly disposed of near food production
areas; formal and informal trading take place in inter-
nal and externally connected networks. This degree of
mixing and contact creates ecological niches with op-
portunities for pathogen transmission, and several in-
uential reports (Smolinski et al., 2003; Knobler et al.,
2006) have linked urbanization to the risk of emerging
infectious diseases (EIDs).
Approximately 60% of human pathogens are zoonotic
(Taylor et al., 2001), and approximately 80% of
novel pathogens have zoonotic origins (Woolhouse &
Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Additionally, urbanization is
likely to make pathogen emergence more likely, but the
actual mechanisms for this happening are poorly un-
derstood.
This project would address a set of questions as part
of a wider research programme on disease emergence in
urban environments. The focus would be on the ecol-
ogy and role of peri-domestic wildlife species (eg ro-dents, scavenging birds) on transmission of pathogens
between livestock, humans

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF CO-INFECTIONS
IN PARASITES WITH COMPLEX LIFE CYCLES
Wild hosts are typically infected with a range of par-
asite species and genotypes of one species at the same
time. This has signicant implications for parasite-
parasite interactions (one factor underlying parasite
virulence) and for host's ability to defend itself against
infections. These associations may also be subjected to
considerable variation depending on the stage of a par-
asite life cycle. This is particularly true for parasites
with complex life cycles that include several consecu-
tive hosts with dierent conditions for co-infections in
each. However, very little is currently known about
these interactions in natural host-parasite systems.
This project will explore responses of parasites and
their hosts to multiple parasite species and genotypeinfections, primarily using trematodes of the genus
Diplostomum. The aims of the project are to determine
(1) the role of antagonistic and facilitative parasite in-
teractions in shaping co-infection dynamics, (2) the role
of dierent types of host responses in determining the
outcome of multiple infections, and (3) the inuence of
spatiotemporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions
on patterns of parasite community assembly. Consider-
able latitude in specic research questions will be given
to the student based on his/her personals interests.

PhD position in vertebrate Evo-Devo at the University
of Konstanz, Germany
We are looking to recruit a PhD student with an in-
terest in vertebrate Evo-Devo, to examine the molecu-
lar basis of jaw development in cichlid shes. Cichlid
shes are exciting models for studying evolution as they
have radiated to produce stunning morphological and
behavioural diversity in a relatively recent time frame.
Perhaps one of the drivers of this radiation has been
innovation in their jaw morphologies. This has enabled
them to occupy a broad range of trophic niches, with
the ability to ingest diverse diets such as algae, zoo-
plankton and molluscs and even the scales and embryos
of other cichlids. It is believed that several unique fea-
tures of the pharyngeal jaws of cichlids have facilitated
this innovation in their trophic morphologies. The goal
of this project is to identify the molecular determinants
of pharyngeal jaw development that are unique to ci-
chlids as a rst step in determining the genetic basis of
their trophic diversication.
This project is being conducted within the laboratory of
Prof. Axel Meyer, which combines both extensive sh
breeding and molecular laboratory facilities. The Uni-
versity of Konstanz is one of Germany^ a ~A^ os Excellence
Universities, providing world-class facilities, and is situ-
ated in Konstanz, a small, vibrant city on the beautiful
shores of Lake Constance. The candidate should have
experience in one or more of the following techniques:
cloning, QRT-PCR, histology or in situ hybridization.
Please send a statement of your research interests, your
CV, the names and contact details of two references and
a letter of motivation by 10th June 2012. Applications
and any informal enquiries should be directed to Helen

DEVO AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOMECHANICS
OF THE MAMMALIAN SECONDARY JAW JOINT
The Weisbecker Lab at the University of Queensland,
Brisbane, Australia, is looking for a motivated PhD
student, ideally with a background in either compara-
tive anatomy, palaeontology, developmental biology, or
biomechanics/engineering to work on a project on de-
velopmental evidence for the processes surrounding the
evolution of the mammalian secondary jaw joint.
The origin of the mammalian middle ear was an ex-
treme transformation in the evolution of mammals
from reptile-like ancestors. Initially devoted to feed-
ing, the jaw joint of the ancestral reptilian jaw joint
was \re-tooled" and miniaturized to form middle ear
bones (tympanic ring, hammer, and anvil). This pro-
cess recapitulates during marsupial mammal develop-
ment, presenting a great opportunity to infer inter-
mediate stages and functional properties of MME de-
tachment for which fossils are lacking. With research
funding provided by the Hermon Slade Foundation,
the Weisbecker lab is calling for applications for a
PhD project on developing marsupials and monotremes
to understand the history of the mammalian middle
ear. The use of CT scanning, advanced virtual re-
construction, and virtual biomechanics (FEA) will al-
low asking whether the growing brain really pulled
the MME bones away from the lower jaw, whether
marsupials and monotremes really evolved their mid-
dle ear independently, and whether the developing
marsupial jaw provides insights into the biomechani-
cal functionality of jaw joint intermediates. For fur-
ther details, visit http://sci-s03.bacs.uq.edu.au/biol/-

PhD is contingent on a successful application for PhD
funding. Overseas applications are particularly encour-

EvolutionLifeHistory
PhD Scholarship: Using telomere dynamics to detect a
physiological constraint on the pace of life-histories.
The Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment at the
University of Western Sydney, Australia, is seeking a
PhD candidate to work on a project in the eld of phys-
iological and evolutionary ecology. The PhD candidate
is anticipated to commence in rst semester 2012.
The project broadly seeks to understand the physiolog-
ical basis of trade-os in life history ecology and evo-
lution. In particular, it will test the hypothesis that
oxidative stress is a cost associated with increased in-
vestment in current production relative to future sur-
vival. The candidate will design and conduct a series of
hypothesis-driven experiments to determine how vari-
ation in the pace of key life-history traits aect rates
of telomere shortening and other molecular indices of
oxidative stress. These experiments will shed light on
the potential for individual mice to make physiologi-
cal adjustments in response to perceived environmental
conditions that maximise lifetime tness but are asso-
ciated with variation in rates of decline in physiological
function.
The student will be advised by Dr Christopher Turbill
(Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment) and work
in collaboration with Professor Rob Brooks, Director
of the Evolution and Ecology Research Centre at the
University of New South Wales.
CRITERIA
The successful applicant should: demonstrate excellent
academic performance related to the research proposed;
hold qualications and experience equal to an Aus-
tralian First Class Bachelor Honours degree; be highly
motivated to undertake further study at an advanced
level; preferably have a background that includes the
elds of comparative animal physiology, metabolism
and ageing, free radical biology, and the evolution of
variation in life history traits. Knowledge and experi-
ence of experimental design and statistical data analysis
would be an advantage.

guage. Please refer to the University's web site
for information about English language require-
ments at www.uws.edu.au/international/admissions/-

Paris 6mnth EvolPlasticityHatching
Topic: evolution and plasticity of hatching
We are looking for a Msc student or a research assis-
tant who will participate in an exciting project for a40 EvolDir June 1, 2012
period of six months, and who will be paid a small
salary according French regulations. The experiment
will take place at the CEREEP-ECOTRON Ile de
France research station in Saint-Pierre-les-Nemours,
France (http://www.foljuif.ens.fr/). Lodging can be ar-
ranged on-site and the experiment is intended to start
in September 2012.
We will use the ECOLAB system to investigate eects
of several environmental variables on the hatching of
annual South-American killish embryos (genus Aus-
trolebias). The experiment will investigate species dif-
ferences in a comparative approach, such that we can
assess variation in these plastic responses produced by
evolution. The ECOLAB is a newly developed research
instrument, a climate room where one can change and
control many environmental variables with high speed
and reliability. We need a team member who will carry
out one of the rst experiments in this new facility.
The goal of the experiment is to investigate the de-
pendence of a rapid and drastic life history decision -
hatching of sh embryos- on evolved species dierences
and on several environmental variables which vary a
lot during a single diurnal cycle. Annual killish em-
bryos spend several months in an egg bank when tem-
porary sh ponds are dry, but they hatch within few
hours when water arrives after heavy rainfall. Hatch-
ing is generally facultative and seems to vary between
species. However, hatching proportions also depend on
the environment, which implies that it might constitute
an evolved bet-hedging strategy with plasticity.

Wanted: Field assistants for underwater observations
The Behavioural Ecology department of the University
Bern, Switzerland (chair: Prof. Michael Taborsky) pro-
vides opportunities for assistants to participate in eld
work in Zambia in autumn 2012.
Project: We study cooperatively breeding, colonial ci-
chlids in Lake Tanganyika, including questions regard-
ing the signicance of coloniality, the ecology of dis-
persal decisions of group members, and habitat-related
variation of behaviour and social structure between
populations. All work will be done using SCUBA diving
down to about 12 meters depth. Detailed behavioural
observations are recorded in situ and individuals will
be caught and measured as required.
Tasks: Usually there will be 2 dives/day on 6 days
/week. Applicants will work independently after a
training phase that will also include learning about the
social structure and behavioural repertoire of the sh.
Field site: We dive mainly in front of a secluded and
very basic lodge located at the lakeshore of Lake Tan-
ganyika in the vicinity of Mpulungu. Limited computer
and internet facilities are available. Meals will be pro-
vided at the lodge.
Requirements: Applicants must be in good health and
physically t, as the diving is very demanding. Experi-
ence with the tropics and with basic conditions without
access to the usual amenities of modern life would be
advantageous. A PADI (or equivalent) diving certi-
cate and diving experience are required. Experience
with behavioural observations would be very useful.
Conditions: Travelling and accommodation costs will
be covered, whereas costs for food and personal needs
are the responsibility of each team member. Consider
at least ca. 7 US$ for food expenses/day). Diving
equipment will be provided, but mask, ns, wet-suit
(7mm+) need to be brought by each team member.
The exact dates of the expedition are not yet deter-
mined, but the trip will last from late August until
early December. Applicants should be ready to briey
visit the institute in Bern beforehand for the required
training in behavioural observations.

VolunteerFieldAssistants
AustralianCuckoos
Two eld assistants for a study on Australian cuckoos
and their hosts Sept 2012 - Jan 2013
Two motivated and capable volunteer eld assistants
are needed for our research project studying the inter-
actions between Australian cuckoos and their hosts in
Canberra, Australia. This is an excellent opportunity
for recent science graduates to gain valuable, hands-on
experience of behavioural and evolutionary research.
Fieldwork will involve:
* assisting with mist-netting of superb fairy-wrens and
yellow-rumped thornbills * searching for nests * moni-
toring nests * assisting with acoustic and video record-
ing * monitoring colour banded birds
The eldwork requires spending 6-8 hours/day, 5
days/week at the eld site. You will be part of a team
of researchers and students working on the project. The
study site is a nature reserve comprising open eucalypt
woodland, and it is 10mins drive from Canberra city
centre and the Australian National University. We will
provide $1500/month living allowance for food and ac-
commodation.
Ideally, applicants should have some eld experience,
good observational skills, be physically t, reliable and
able to work independently. Experience monitoring
colour banded birds, nest searching or mist-nettingJune 1, 2012 EvolDir 49
would be a great advantage, but is not essential.
For more information, and to apply, please contact
Naomi Langmore (naomi.langmore@anu.edu.au). In-
terested applicants should email a cover letter, a CV
and the contact details for two referees (ideally at leastone referee who has worked with you in the eld) to
the address above. Please send your application by 30
June at the latest.

Field Assistants Required Immediately-Columbian
ground squirrels
Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada
We are looking for 2 volunteers to assist with eld-
work beginning ASAP and continuing until Aug 3,
2012. The project investigates the evolutionary ecol-
ogy of Columbian ground squirrels. As a member of
the study, assistants will be involved with monitor-
ing the phenology (when animals emerge from hiberna-
tion), reproduction and survival of individuals. Field-
work will involve live-trapping and handling of animals,
behavioural observation, radio-telemetry (to locate na-
tal burrows) and assistance with the measurement of
physiological (metabolism) traits on free-ranging ani-
mals. This is an excellent opportunity to gain experi-
ence working with a collaborative research team on a
long-term study of a wild mammal.
All eldwork is carried out in the spectacular RockyMountains of southwestern Alberta, Canada, home to
some of the most majestic wildlife in North America.
We will be staying at the University of Calgary's R.B.
Miller research station in Sheep River Provincial Park,
Alberta. You will interact with other researchers work-
ing with ground squirrels on a diversity of projects in
behavioural and population ecology. Additionally, the
eld station is home to a number of other researchers
working on a variety of projects, ranging from insects
to large mammals.
Food and accommodation are provided, but you will be
required to make your own way to either Calgary or Ed-
monton. Training will be provided and no experience is
necessary, but candidates should have an interest in a
number of the following (the more the better!): ecology,
evolutionary biology, wildlife, eld biology, and animal
behaviour. Periods of time will be spent camping and,
as such, successful applicants need to enjoy the out-
doors, be up-beat, positive, responsible and work well
as a member of a team. If you wish to apply for one
of these posts then please send a CV with a cover let-
ter and contact details of three references (with e-mail
address), by email to Je Lane (contact info below).
Review of applications will commence immediately and50 EvolDir June 1, 2012

Irwin lab manual
Hello folks (and, hopefully, Rebecca Irwin, herself)!
I'm preparing to teach a laboratory class in Evolution
in January and have been searching around for inspira-
tion. There are lots of great ideas out there and one re-
source that is repeatedly suggested by the interwebs is a
lab manual prepared by someone named Rebecca Irwin
who worked at the University of Tennessee at Martin
(http://www.utm.edu/sta/rirwin/evol.htm). [Please
note, I'm almost positive this is not the Rebecca E.
Irwin who works at Dartmouth].
Unfortunately, however, all of the links on her class
page are dead and the email contact listed on the page
doesn't work either. If anyone happens to know Re-
becca, could you please forward this request to her?
Or, if anyone happens to have a copy of the lab man-
ual, would you consider sharing it with me?
Have a great evening, BEST wishes, Lesley

Journal Society Coevolution
clarication 3
Dear Colleagues,
Since my proposal of a journal coevolution, I have re-
ceived a number of emails how what should be included
as coevolution. I can sense a great deal of inconsis-
tencies and wish to post what I (probably wrongly)
thought to be coevolution and co-adaptation.
I. We should rst dene evolution, adaptation, preadap-
tation and exaptation before discussing coevolution.
What we need to specify:
1. A species S (e.g., a locust) with n genotypes, repre-
sented by a population with genotypes g1, g2, ..., gn.
2. The associated genotypic frequencies Pg1, Pg2, ...,Pgn, represented by the vector Pg.
Evolution happens when Pg changes over time. This
can be caused by mutation, selection, drift and may
other mechanisms. However, our focus is on selection
and its possible outcome, adaptation.
Environmental factors, such as the application of pes-
ticide, can cause dramatic changes in Pg in some insect
species. If it eliminates all genetic lineages contained in
all populations of a species, then extinction happens.
If the pesticide can reduce g1, g2, ..., gn individuals by
a fraction of q1, q2, ..., qn, but the genotypic frequen-
cies rebound to the original values after the pesticide
is cleared o, then we see evolution as well as selection
in action, but there is no adaptation of the population
to the pesticide. We probably should dene selection
a bit more explicitly. Let F1, F2, ..., Fn be the tness
of genotypes g1, g2, ..., gn, respectively. Whenever an
environmental factor can dierentially change F1, F2,
..., Fn and consequently Pg1, Pg2, ..., Pgn, that envi-
ronmental factor is a selection agent and the process of
dierential change of F1, F2, ..., Fn is selection.
Suppose some individuals in the population happen to
have an enzyme (E) that can partially detoxify the pes-
ticide and allow the carriers to propagate their lineages,
albeit at a much reduced rate r new relative to the orig-
inal r old. If the enzyme E originated before the appli-
cation of pesticide, we again see natural selection in
action but do not see adaptation.
If, in the presence of the selection agent (i.e., pesticide),
some individuals evolved a much more eective E that
can completely detoxify the pesticide so that the tness
of the carriers of the enzyme (i.e., the gene encoding the
enzyme) increases as a consequence, then we can claim
to have observed adaptation (the origin of a new trait
or a new trait value benecial to the carriers in response
to a selection agent).
If the new enzyme E can now also detoxies a nasty
compound in a plant and allows the insect species to
exploit this previously unavailable food resource, then
that is preadaptation which, according to Stephen J.
Gould, involves a trait that was selected for a function
but later gained a new function benecial to the carrier.
In contrast to preadaptation, if a trait originated as a
neutral trait but subsequently become benecial in a
new environment, then that is exaptation.
All three hypotheses (adaptation, preadaptation and
exaptation) are potential explanations for the gain of
positive charges in the proteins of the gastric pathogen,
Helicobacter pylori, that inhabits the acidic environ-
ment in the mammalian stomach. A test of these threeJune 1, 2012 EvolDir 53
hypotheses was reported in an earlier paper of mine
(Xia, X. and G. Palidwor. 2005. Genomic Adaptation
to Acidic Environment: Evidence from Helicobacter py-
lori. American Naturalist 166:776-784).
How can adaptation be observed given that we typi-
cally cannot observe the ancestral trait, e.g., when we
have the current E enzyme but do not have the original
E enzyme. How would we know if this enzyme repre-
sents adaptation, preadaptation or exaptation? We do
this by comparing the species/population to its phylo-
genetically related lineages. If all phylogenetic lineages,
regardless of whether they have been exposed to the
pesticide or not, all have an eective detoxifying en-
zyme, then we have to settle with either preadaptation
or exaptation. In contrast, if those phylogenetic lin-
eages that have not been exposed to the pesticide have
only a weakly detoxifying E enzyme and only those that
are exposed to the pesticide harbour an eective detox-
ifying E enzyme, then we may infer that the eective
detoxifying enzyme may indeed represent an adapta-
tion, evolved in response to the pesticide as a selection
agent.
II. Let's now come to coevolution and co-adaptation at
the organismal level.
What we need to specify:
1. A minimum of two species, A and B, each repre-
sented by a population with n and m genotypes, re-
spectively. That is a1, a2, ..., an for species A, and b1,
b2, ..., bm for species B.
2. The associated genotypic frequencies Pa1, Pa2, ...,
Pan, and Pb1, Pb2, ..., Pbm, represented by vectors Pa
and Pb, respectively.
3. Fitness of each genotype: Fa1, Fa2, ..., Fan, and
Fb1, Fb2, ..., Fbm, represented by vectors Fa and Fb,
respectively.

PCR machines
Dear all,
our last PCR machine broke down a few weeks ago and
we are now at a standstill. Does any of you have a PCR
machine (and any other basic equipment) that they can
freely pass on to our lab in Uganda (Makerere Univer-
sity) so that we can continue training our students and
conducting research? Thanks a lot.

Next talk on http://phyloseminar.org/ : \Adaptation,
coevolution, and convergence in the context of protein
thermodynamics" David Pollock (University of Col-
orado School of Medicine)
Interactions within and between proteins are a funda-
mentally important part of how they evolve and adapt.
We have been considering how and why proteins adapt,
coevolve, and converge, and working to understand
these concepts in the context of protein thermostabil-
ity and function. We will expand from the previous
talk of our collaborator, Dr. Goldstein, and discuss
how and why coevolution is and should be detected,
and how thermostability aects reconstruction of an-
cestral functions. Further, we will discuss our work on
adaptive redesign in mitochondrial proteins, perhaps
the largest known case of an adaptive burst in multiple
metabolic proteins. The convergence between ances-
tral snakes and ancestral acrodont lizards is also per-
haps the largest known case of adaptive convergence.
We will consider what these examples tell us about the
theory of how proteins appear to evolve in the con-
text of nearly neutral versus cases of adaptive change.
Further, we will discuss the impact on understanding
phylogenetic relationships, and we will also discuss a
unied theory of nearly neutral and adaptive evolution
in the context of structure and function.

ResearchOpportunties
Dear all56 EvolDir June 1, 2012
This is to inform you about the opportunity to develop
research with me and my collaborators at Rennes, us-
ing existing extensive data sets, well studied eld set-
tings and my support to put together a proposal for
one of the multiple French/European/outside funding
opportunities. I will below present (i) some of the data
or eld settings exploitable; (ii) a very incomplete list
of possible research questions to be developed and for
which databases or eld setting would be available; (iii)
the research environment at Rennes and Rennes per
se; (iv) a list of dierent funding opportunities from
the Rennes/French/European side - but you may have
many others from your own locality/country/continent;
(v) a list of my recent publications showing (hopefully)
the competences in the eld.
Please do not hesitate to transmit or contact me if in-
terested.
Best regards
Andreas Prinzing
(i) DATA and FIELD SETTINGS potentially available
(data are in part assembled from freely available sources
and any publication project will of course need to ac-
knowledge these sources, many other data are available
via/due to internal or external collaboration and any
publication project will of course need to nd the agree-
ment of, and involve, these collaborators)
- descriptions of tens of thousands of local plant species
communities
- niche requirements of most plant species from eld
measurements for an entire region (Netherlands)
- dated phylogeny of all Angiosperm plant species of an
entire regional species pool resolved to at least genus
level (Netherlands; >500 genera)
- dozens of functional traits of many to all plant species
of an entire regional pool (Central Eruope)
- composition of arthropod communities (oribatid
mites, heteroptera, coleoptera, galls, lepidoptera, min-
ers, parasitoid groups) of canopy trees, linked to mea-
surements of soil biota (mycorrhiza and their activity,
invertebrates, microbial biomass) and of biotic and abi-
otic environmental factors on the same trees, as well as
the composition of the ambient forest canopy, notably
the phylogenetic distance of the neighbours.
- the trees from which many of the above data stem
- descendents of plants whose ancestors grew in dier-
ent community neighbourhoods, and morphological and
biochemical characterizations
- community compositions of plants, their ant mutual-
ists, their services and the role of cheaters along envi-ronmental disturbance gradients
(ii) Possible QUESTIONS to be developed with the
data or eld settings already available in my group.
For some of them, projects are already written and can
serve as a basis for proposal writing. Of course many
other questions would be equally interesting and pos-
sible to develop, and again partly even with available
data.***:
- Microevolution on macroevolutionary islands: acceler-
ated evolution of colonizers on phylogenetically isolated
host trees?
- Leaving its ancestral niche to respond to environmen-
tal change: a problem of recruitment limitation?
- Does phylogenetic heritage of dierent vegetation
types control decomposer assembly and decomposition?
- Does phylogenetic heritage of dierent vegetation
types control productivity?
- Is niche conservatism a blessing under environmen-
tal change due increased evolution of hybrids? Is it a
blessing due to improved nutrient cycling in communi-
ties composed of closely related species?
- How does plant neighbourhood inuence plant traits?
- What are the steps involved in the expression of local
adaptation?
- How does patch age and patch isolation control com-
munity assembly in the canopy?
- What is the role of phenotypic integration for the re-
sponse to environmental change?
(iii) The host lab here is the UNITE MIXTE DE
RECHERCHE (UMR) ECOBIO - ECOSYSTEMES ,
BIODIVERSITE , EVOLUTION, co-funded by Univer-
sity of Rennes 1 and Centre National de la Recherche
Scientique, is a large institution with several dozen
CNRS-researchers, docents and professors, plus tech-

history evolution, and adaptation, expertise at the in-
terface between macroevolution and macroecology, ex-
pertise in ecophysiology, landscape ecology and behav-
ioral ecology, environmental genomics (very strong),
community assembly and plant/herbivore interactions.
Among others, Ecobio has given itself a Research Axis

SouthAfrica Volunteers
SmallMammalEvolution
3 volunteers needed from July / August to November
/ December 2012
as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relatingto evolution, ecology and behavior before starting an
MsC or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus this year is on person-
ality traits of striped mice. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night
in winter, sometimes over 40C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of eld assistants: Trapping, marking and radio-
tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral observations
in the eld. Volunteers will participate in a project on
personality traits of striped mice, doing behavioral tests
at the research station and in the eld. Volunteers are
also expected to help with maintenance of the research
station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1250 (around 180 US$, 120 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
2500, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$, 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country (eg. DAAD in
Germany, SSJARP in Switzerland).
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).58 EvolDir June 1, 2012
When and how long: At the moment we are looking for
2-3 volunteers starting in July / August 2012. Volun-
teers are expected to stay at least three months, but
longer periods of up to 6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@ieu.uzh.ch.

of mechanisms of development in chordates. Our work
focuses on comparative approaches between vertebrates
(zebrash), urochordates and cephalochordates. Our
main subject of study is Oikopleura dioica, a new emer-

BrownU PlantPhylogenomics
The Edwards lab at Brown University is looking for
a post-doctoral research associate to join our ongoing
eorts focused on the evolution of succulence and al-
ternative photosynthetic syndromes in the Caryophyl-
lales. The postdoc will take the lead in the molec-
ular/phylogenomic aspects of the project. We are
currently building molecular phylogenies with tradi-
tional, whole chloroplast-genome and transcriptome ap-
proaches, and she/he will be responsible for generating
and analyzing all of these data types. She/he will also
take responsibility for general oversight of the molecu-lar lab. While some goals are quite rm (e.g., improved
phylogenies for several clades of Caryophyllales), there
will be plenty of opportunity to develop other projects
based on the postdoc's own interests- this will be ac-
tively encouraged.
The successful candidate will be a highly motivated,
careful scientist and a team player, with a genuine
love of plants and their remarkable evolutionary his-
tory. She/he will have a proven track record in project
design, data collection, analysis, and publication. Pre-
vious lab experience with library prep/analysis of next-
gen sequencing, a familiarity with large datasets, and
good computing and analytical skills are also impor-
tant qualities. Contingent upon funding, there may be
exciting eld work opportunities as well, so experience
with (and enthusiasm for) plant collecting is an added
bonus (though not essential).
The position start date is exible and could potentially
begin in September 2012; ideally the position will start
no later than December 2012. The initial appointment
will be for one year, with extension dependent on per-
formance and funding. To apply, please send a letter
describing research interests, a current CV, and con-
tact information for three references to Erika Edwards
(erika edwards@brown.edu). Applications will be re-
viewed starting immediately and accepted until the po-
sition is lled. Brown University is an EEO/AA em-

The Position:
Enzymes are crucial components of the agricultural,
medical, and industrial biotechnologies, and they play a
critical role in protein biochemistry research conducted
at CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences (CES). Wild-type en-
zymes sourced from nature are often found not to be
t for intended purposes, requiring signicant modica-
tions by modern protein engineering technologies before
being incorporated into commercial processes and prod-
ucts. These technologies are already powerful, but their
successful application is often stymied by the problem
of unpredictable negative intramolecular epistasis.The Bioinformatics & Phylogenomics team at CES,
led by Lars Jermiin, is leading a collaboration (with
Colin Scott and John Oakeshott (CES) and Dan Taw-
k (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel)) aimed at de-
veloping novel computational methods to predict pat-
terns of intramolecular interactions reliably in enzymes
of interest, which would signicantly improve our abil-
ity to rationally redesign enzymes. In this context,
CSIRO is oering an exciting opportunity for a three-
year OCE Postdoctoral Fellowship in computational bi-
ology within the Bioinformatics & Phylogenomics team.
In this position, you will have primary responsibility

tation and evaluation of computational methods to ex-
ploit semi-automatically the vast amounts of sequence
data already available to identify residues within en-
zymes that may have co-evolved.
CSIRO oers all postdoctoral fellows a development
plan, tailored to your experience and interests, to fur-
ther your career in science. Part of the plan includes
formal and on-the-job training, with mentoring also an
option. You will have access to CSIRO's extensive re-
search facilities as well as the opportunity to collabo-
rate with postdoctoral and research scientists in other
CSIRO Divisions.
Specically you will:
* Develop, implement, and test methods to measure
and predict intramolecular epistasis in proteins. * Ap-
ply the computational methods in research on protein
structure- function relationships. * Participate in the
identication of further opportunities arising from re-
search and initiate new lines of research. * Assist in
the planning and preparation of research proposals and
carry out investigations.

MPI Marburg FungalBiodiversity
Post doc position Max Planck Marburg Evolutionary
Genomics
Post doc position in the Max Planck Research Group in
Fungal Biodiversity A one-year postdoctoral position is
available in the eld of molecular evolution and com-
putational biology in the newly established Max Planck
Research Group in Fungal Biodiversity headed by Dr.
Eva H. Stukenbrock. Our team is part of the Max
Planck Institute of Terrestrial Microbiology in Mar-
burg, Germany (http://www.mpi-marburg.mpg.de).
Background We study speciation and host specializa-
tion processes in fungal plant pathogens in an evolu-
tionary and ecological context. A main goal of our re-
search is to understand the underlying molecular mech-
anism of species divergence and adaptive processes in
host-pathogen systems. We integrate functional and ex-
perimental approaches with high throughput sequence
data and bioinformatics to study the functional and
evolutionary biology of closely related pathogen species,
which have evolved and specialized to dierent hosts
and environments. Our model system is a group of
closely related grass pathogens including the promi-nent wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola. To
contrast evolutionary processes in dierent ecosystems
we have compared population genomic data from M.
graminicola and closely related species infecting non-
cultivated hosts in natural grasslands. In the lab,
we validate and characterize candidate genes emerging
from our evolutionary predictions. For this we have de-
veloped genetic tools and functional assays to study the
role of candidate genes in host specialization or specia-
tion.
Objectives This post doctoral project focuses on the
evolution of gene regulation, and its implication in host
specialization and speciation. The selected post doc
candidate will be in charge of analyzing a large tran-
scriptome dataset including RNAseq data from dier-
ent combinations of host and pathogen species. Re-
search perspectives are open, and the post doc candi-
date will be largely involved in the design of all ex-
periments and analyses, providing they relate to host
specialization and speciation.
Prerequisites The post doctoral candidate will ideally:
? Have a PhD in evolutionary biology with expertise in
bioinformatics and genomics. ? Be procient in sta-
tistical computing, including experience with R and
analysis of large data sets in a linux environment. ?
Have basic programming / scripting skills (Bash, Perl,
Python, or similar).
Contact Application should be sent to Eva H. Stuken-
brock (eva.stukenbrock@mpi-marburg.mpg.de) before
June 1st. The position will however remain open until
lled. The application should include a short CV with
statement of research interests, together with a cover
letter including names and contact information of two
references.

SyracuseU EvolutionaryGenomics
POST-DOCTORAL POSITIONS IN EVOLUTION-
ARY GENOMICS AT SYRACUSE UNIVERISTY
Applications are invited for postdoctoral research posi-
tions in the laboratory of Steve Dorus at Syracuse Uni-
versity. My lab is interested in evolutionary genetics
and the role sexual selection plays in genome evolution.
Much of our current research focuses on integrating
proteomic, transcriptomic and chromatin immunopre-
cipitation (CHiP) approaches to obtain systems level
insights into the evolutionary genomics of sperm devel-
opment and function. Our experimental work has his-
torically focused on sperm proteomics and genomics in
Drosophila and mammals, including various mouse and
non-human primate species. We have now expanded
our studies to avian taxa, where we are studying the
functional capacities of seminal uid proteins, and to
lepidoptera to better understand the evolutionary ge-
netics underlying sperm heteromorphism. Ultimately,
we are interested in understanding the interplay be-
tween evolutionary conservation and adaptation asso-
ciated with sexual reproduction through the molecular
characterization of male reproductive systems across a
diverse range of taxa.
We encourage applications from highly motivated and
independent candidates with strong backgrounds in
evolutionary genetics, genomics, bioinformatics and/or
reproductive biology. Postdocs in the lab can expect to
be involved in a variety of research projects and are en-
couraged to bring their scientic interest to bear on the
direction of the research. Most research in the lab will
involve both wet lab and computational approaches, in-
cluding the generation and analysis of proteomic, tran-
scriptomic and genome-wide chromatin maps. Com-
petitive applicants are expected to have relevant exper-
imental and analytic training.
Environment: The Department of Biology at SU is lo-
cated in the recently constructed Life Science Center,
which includes modern lab and computational facili-
ties. The Department has a strong concentration in
ecology and evolutionary research, including sexual se-lection and the genetics of adaptation. SU benets
from a close association with SUNY Upstate Medical
University, which has a large faculty devoted to clini-
cal research as well as next-generation sequencing, pro-
teomics and microarray facilities.

UAmsterdam MothSexPheromone
In collaboration with Max Planck Institute for Chemi-
cal Ecology (Jena, Germany) and North Carolina State
University (Raleigh, USA), the Institute for Biodiver-
sity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED, University of
Amsterdam) has started a research project that com-
bines evolutionary biology with molecular and chemi-
cal ecology. It aims to identify the gene(s) underlying
sex pheromone variation in the noctuid moth /Heliothis
subexa/. This project has a vacancy for a
*Postdoc molecular / evolutionary biology*
*1,0 fte (38 hours/week)*
In /H. subexa/, one group of sex pheromone compo-
nents, the acetates, emitted by the female, plays a cru-
cial isolating role in preventing interspecic matings to
males of the closely related /H. virescens, /in which fe-
males do not produce acetates and males are repelled
by them. We previously found intraspecic variation
in the acetates in /H. subexa/: females in Eastern
North America contain signicantly more acetates than
females in Western Mexico. Recently, we found theJune 1, 2012 EvolDir 73
persistence of this intraspecic variation in laboratory-
reared strains, and identied one major QTL, explain-
ing 40% of the variance in acetate amounts. We homol-
ogized this intraspecic QTL to our previously iden-
tied interspecic QTL using Restriction Associated
DNA (RAD) tags.We found that the major intraspecic
QTL overlaps with one of the two major interspecic
QTL.
This project will be a unique opportunity to identify the
gene(s) involved in intra- and interspecic variation in
moth sexual communication. Even though premating
isolation is hypothesized to be a major driving force in
speciation, its genetic basis is poorly known, and iden-
tifying genes will greatly help to understand how moth
sexual communication may evolve. Since we identied
the genomic location, as well as candidate genes, and
we have introgressed lines available, this project has
great potential.
Requirements
We are looking for a molecular biologist with an evo-
lutionary background. The ideal candidate is highly
motivated and has a strong interest in molecular ecol-
ogy and evolution. Molecular skills are required and
extensive experience is preferred. At the start of the
project the candidate will need to collect larvae from
North Carolina and Western Mexico. The candidate is
also willing to work in the three dierent labs involved,
even though the basis will be in Amsterdam.

Forest Sciences and Conservation University of British
Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Supervisors: Richard
Hamelin and Kermit Ritland
A post-doctoral fellowship is available in the area of
population and evolutionary genomics of forest fun-
gal pathogens. We are resequencing whole genomes
of several isolates of a Pucciniales, an Oomycete, and
a Dothydeomycetes species. All three species are in-
vasive and currently causing considerable damage to
native forest trees. The major objective of this posi-
tion is to (1) identify patterns of SNP variation and
perform tests of neutrality, (2) identify and study the
evolution of genes involved with pathogenicity, (3) in-
fer migrational and sexual history of these pathogens,
and (4) develop new approaches for using whole genome
scans to infer migrational processes. Applicants should
have the appropriate computational or statistical skills,June 1, 2012 EvolDir 75
and should have a penchant for developing new ap-
proaches. No background in mycology is needed. To
apply, submit a CV, a cover letter and names and con-
tact information of three referees to Kermit Ritland
(kermit.ritland@ubc.ca). The start date can be imme-
diate or by September 2012 at the latest. The duration
can be up to 2 years. This project is funded by Genome
BC, Genome Canada, and the Canadian Forest Service.

UCDavis EvolutionaryGenomics
Postdoctoral researcher: Ecological/evolutionary
genomics of non-model plants (UC Davis). We seek
a postdoctoral researcher to join a collaborative,
international project on the ecological and genomic
diversication of two lineages of plants in the Cape
Floristic Region of South Africa. Genus Protea
and genus Pelargonium contain hundreds of species
packed into the super-diverse fynbos and succulent
karroo biomes. These lineages have radiated in an
aridifying climate over the past 10+ MY, occupying
new ecological space and rapidly diversifying in mor-
phology and function. The project group1s members
have previously studied geographic distributions and
functional trait variation in these plants. In this
project, funded by NSF1s Dimensions of Biodiversity
program, we are using next-generation sequencing
and genomic data analysis to link functional traits
of species and populations in these groups to genetic
variation. We are especially interested in how traits
and genes have evolved along gradients in aridity and
nutrient limitation. (http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/-
wiki/index.php/Parallel Evolutionary radiation
sinProtea andPelargonium intheGreater Cape Floristic Region)
In the rst year of the project, we established a common
garden in Cape Town containing families from many
populations of two focal species. The initial focus of
this postdoctoral research project will be to use tran-
scriptome sequences from these common garden plants
to associate genetic variation with plant trait expression
and source environments. Beyond this initial analysis,
the postdoctoral researcher will be encouraged to pur-
sue their own interests within the larger project frame-
work. Topics include but are not limited to phyloge-
netic trait evolution, phylogeography, and adaptation
to drought and nutrient decient soils.
This position will be based in Andrew Latimer1slab in the Department of Plant Sciences and Grad-
uate Group in Ecology at the University of Cali-
fornia Davis (http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/-

nity of plant genomics researchers on campus and en-
courage development of collaborations. There will also
be opportunities to visit the labs of collaborating in-
vestigators at the University of Connecticut, Australian
National University and/or Cape Town. The postdoc-
toral researcher will participate in and supervise lab
work, but will focus on data analysis, statistical method
development and paper writing.
Requirements: Ph.D. in Genetics, Ecology & Evolu-
tionary Biology, Bioinformatics, or closely related eld.
Experience in producing, analyzing and interpreting ge-
nomic data. Enthusiasm for collaborating with an in-

tion history and structure, and the genetics of complex
traits. Most projects in the lab include both data anal-
ysis and development of new statistical/computational
methods or occasionally theoretical models.
We seek applicants who are creative, energetic, and can
work independently. We operate a relatively small but
intense lab. The goal is that everyone should have the
resources and support that they need to be successful,
and our past lab members have an outstanding record

Description NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS) has statutory obligations to protect marine
mammals within its Extended Economic Zone and be-
yond. Such protection requires thorough understand-
ing of the natural history of the various groups, such as
cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sirenians, including all lev-
els of evolutionary relationships. The marine-mammal
collection of over 11,000 specimens at the Smithso-
nian Institution's National Museum of Natural His-
tory (NMNH) is a result of long-term collaboration
between NMNH and NMFS and is one of the best
in the world. The diversity of this collection allows
broadly-based research on comparative morphology of
systematic characters. The large number of specimens
of many species permits analyses of variability among
individuals, sexes, life-history stages. and geographic
areas. Furthermore, the museum's Laboratory for An-
alytical Biology, located at the Museum Support Cen-82 EvolDir June 1, 2012
ter, provides the capability for state-of-the-art analyses
for molecular systematics. We expect that the Asso-
ciate will work with the National Collection at NMNH
using combined morphological and molecular methods
to investigate questions of importance to NMFS. Pos-
sible general directions for the research include (1) ex-
amination of taxonomic problems of complex groups of
species and their populations, (2) phylogenetic and bio-
geographic investigations using molecular techniques in
combination with morphological characters from speci-mens in museum collections, and (3) comparative stud-
ies examining evolution of life-history characteristics or
biogeography.

Barcelona Diversity Jul2-6
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce a workshop on the mea-
surement of diversity - from managing the genetic di-
versity of farm animals to quantifying the biodiversity
of ecosystems. This forms part of a ve-week event at
the Centre de Recerca Matem atica, Barcelona on \The
Mathematics of Biodiversity", with the one week work-June 1, 2012 EvolDir 83
shop/exploratory conference taking up the middle week
from the 2nd to the 6th July, 2012.
The two weeks before the workshop will focus on under-
standing the problems faced in the various elds, iden-
tifying how these problems overlap between research
domains, and understanding what solutions already ex-
ist in dierent areas. The workshop itself will focus on
communicating identied problems and potential solu-
tions between all of the participants. The nal two
weeks will focus on the development of (potentially
novel) solutions to the problems that have been pre-
viously identied.
We welcome experienced researchers, both pure and ap-
plied, in these elds to the workshop as well as people
new to the area and with related problems and inter-
ests, and we encourage people to stay for longer than
the single week of the workshop if they wish to develop
their interests further. We are also taking oers of con-
tributed talks - if you would like to give one, please
contact us as soon as possible.
Our current list of speakers is:
Benjamin Allen John Baez Michael Bonsall Anne Chao
Christina Cobbold Glenn De'ath Elizabeth Gillet Hans-
Rolf Gregorius Lou Jost Tom Leinster Alison Mather

Basel MicrobiotaEvolution Sep12-14
Just a reminder that the WORKSHOP DEADLINE
(for the tutorial) IS APPROACHING!!!
The Organizing Committee would like to invite you to
attend a 3-day international workshop on the \Evolu-
tion and Ecology of Host-Associated Microbiota" to be
held at the Zoological Institute, University of Basel,
Switzerland on September 12- 14, 2012. The major
aim of this workshop is to provide a synthesis of the
emerging evolutionary and ecological patterns govern-
ing the complex interactions of host-microbiota across
dierent biological systems. We have invited leaders
in the eld of host-associated microbiota and micro-
bial ecology to share their insights on the evolutionary
and ecological principles that shape bacterial commu-
nity structure and host-microbiota interactions.
This workshop is intended for undergraduate students,
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early
career investigators (100 slots available) who wanted to
be exposed to the evolutionary and ecological concepts
and bioinformatics tools being applied on the study of
host-associated microbiota systems and microbial ecol-
ogy. Together with the lecture, a hands-on tutorial
(bioinformatic tools and approaches encompassing mi-
crobial ecology, comparative genomics, molecular evo-
lution) will be provided on the analysis of complex se-
quence data sets derived from next-generation sequenc-
ing.
Thanks to the generous funding from ProDoc of the
Swiss National Science Foundation and the University
of Basel, we are only charging a minimal fee of CHF
150 for registration (includes 3 lunches, 1 social
dinner, 2 social mixers and snacks during the entire
workshop) or CHF 250 (+ tutorial on the analysis of
next-generation sequences; 50 slots available). We also
have arranged for a number of rooms around Basel
ranging from youth hostel dormitories (CHF 32-79/
day) to 3-star hotels (CHF 160- 250/ day). Moreover,
Basel/Mulhouse Airport is a hub for Easyjet, a budget
airline in Europe. Application deadline for the tutorial
is May 30 and for the lecture series is June 30, 2012.

talking about his experience with the media and why
he does it. The panellists will introduce an area of jour-
nalism and discuss their experiences with interviewing
researchers. Then the panel discussion will expand on
some of the challenges scientists face and the practical
communication solutions. Finally a break-out session
will allow for an interactive round table letting partici-
pants choose a topic of particular interest (how to give
an interview, how to pitch a science book to a publisher,June 1, 2012 EvolDir 87
101 for scientists using social media). The workshop
will conclude with a networking session between fellow

Workshop Summary:
To most young students of evolutionary biology it
comes as a surprise that the eld is quite mathemati-
cally oriented. Understanding evolution requires a rm
grasp of its theoretical foundation, and making state-
ments about specic cases may require developing new
models. With mathematical modeling, it is impossi-
ble to bring people from novice to expert level in one
half-day workshop, but improved scientic literacy re-
garding theoretical work is a reasonable goal. With this
goal in mind, this workshop -dissects' examples from re-
cent theoretical work. The aim is to improve students'
ability to digest theoretical papers beyond the often en-
countered attitude \I'll read the introduction and the
discussion only, and will trust whatever is in between",
and give some initial guidance to wannabe modellers.
Please bring your laptop to this workshop.

chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
