Apr23-25
The BSPB Spring Meeting 2014 will take place at Lan-
caster University, UK which is set in 360 acres of beau-
tiful parkland and lies approximately three miles south
of the City of Lancaster. The campus is easily accessi-
ble via road and rail, and is within 70 miles of Manch-ester's International Airport. The meeting opens on
the Wednesday evening with a Plenary Lecture on the
use of protists to investigate eukaryotic origins, given
by Martin Embley. Two symposia then follow.
The rst celebrates the distinguished career of Bland
Finlay who, after 35 years of protistan research, has
recently retired from his academic post at Queen
Mary University of London. Speakers paying trib-
ute to Bland's contribution to protistan biodiversity,
biogeography and ecology include Genoveva Estaban,
Tom Fenchel, Stephen Maberly, Bill Martin and David
Wilkinson.
The second symposium examines the evolution and
ecology of agellate protists within the guts of in-
sects, with invited contributions from Rod Dillon (Sand
y), Petros Ligoxygakis (Drosophila), Eamonn Mal-
lon (Bumblebee) and Renate Radek (Termites). The
meeting also welcomes contributed papers on any as-
pect of protistology and is particularly keen to en-
courage student contributions. To this end, Student
travel/accommodation bursaries are available, together
with the Humphrey Smith Student Prizes for best oral
and poster presentations.

only the successful abstracts will be given as talks, the
other abstracts will be accepted for poster presentations
(according to the number of slots available). Guidelines
on presentation formats are given below.
*Oral contributors*
All speakers (apart from the keynote speakers) have
been allocated 20 minutes. You should therefore pre-
pare a 15 min talk to allow time for questions and
switching between presenters. The system is a PC and
PowerPoint is installed. The presentation should be

board?
You can, but you don't have to. May I ship my poster
to you in advance to avoid baggage charges?
Yes, of course! Email us using assobdem@mnhn.fr to
know the shipping address. (You may wish to bring the
poster on a USB stick in case it is lost or damaged in
the post, but we do not have access to an A0-printer
here, so you would have to go to a shop nearby to get6 EvolDir January 1, 2014
it printed in the worst case).
*Venue and travel*
The conference will take place at the Mus eum national
d'Histoire naturelle, in the auditorium of the Grande
Galerie de l'Evolution (GGE) on 12th and 13 th Febru-

PuertoRico.SMBE14.MutationSymposium.June8-12
We are hosting a Symposium at SMBE 2014 (June 8th-
12th, San Juan, Puerto Rico) entitled, \Mutation: The
Ultimate Source of Molecular Variation," and invite
you to submit abstracts for contributed talks here:
http://smbe.org/annual/2014/scientic-program/call-
for-symposia/ As biologists, we are interested in
explaining variation at multiple levels: what makes
species dierent, what makes individuals dierent,
what makes genes dierent, etc. One cannot study such
variation without understanding mutation. Mutations
can result from errors during replication, mistakes
during recombination, or from environmental factors.
Although there are mutation rates estimated for taxa,
mutation rates vary across the genome, and may
vary with age. While point-mutations have been well
studied, more complex events like indels or segmental-
duplications have not. Mutations are of great interest
for studying population history and mechanisms of
evolution. Mutations are also widely sought after
as the causes of disease and phenotypic variation.
However, mutations do not occur in a vacuum; genetic
background inuences mutations' impact on tness.
In this symposium, we bring together researchers who
study the origin and impact of mutations, including
the inuence of mutation patterns on evolution and
disease.
We are pleased to highlight our two invited speakers:
Donald F. Conrad, Washington University in St. Louis:
'The developmental basis of mutation in mammals.'
Rebecca A. Zufall, University of Houston: 'Mutation
accumulation in the absence of selection in the ciliate
Tetrahymena thermophila.'

PuertoRico SMBE InvertGenomics
Jun8-12 CallAbstracts
Dear colleagues and friends,
There will be a symposium entitled \Establishing a
"Global Invertebrate Genome Alliance\ (GIGA) for
Comparative Genomics" at SMBE 2014 to be held in
Puerto Rico from June 8-12, 2014.
We aim to bring together researchers that help com-
prise a \Global Invertebrate Genome Alliance" (GIGA
- http://giga.nova.edu). This community of scientists
(COS) was only recently forged in 2013 with the ul-
timate aim to cooperatively sequence or analyse whole
genomes and transcriptomes of approximately 7,000 se-
lected invertebrates, with a focus on non-insect, non-
nematode marine taxa. A white paper is available
at the Journal of Heredity, which outlines GIGA's
goals, data and methodological standards (http://-
jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/105/1/1.full).
This symposium is organized by Jose V. Lopez, Todd
Oakley, and Christian R Voolstra. It addresses modern
genome technology with the history of life, and will be
another step in helping the GIGA community to grow
and exchange ideas in a molecular evolutionary context.
The presentations will be selected from the
submitted abstracts at the SMBE web site
(https://mcidublin.conference-services.net/-
authorlogin.asp?conferenceID=3958&language=en-
uk).
We are looking forward to your participation and ab-
stract submission.
Best Regards, Chris, Joe & Todd

From emerging to pandemic viruses: interplay between
host ecology and viral evolution

CJM Regoes en.htm Deadline for registration:
Jan 10, 2014
Emerging viruses are recognized to be a threat not only
to human health but also to activities, such as crop or
cattle farming, and even to endangered species. This
Jacques Monod conference will study virus evolution
and emergence through an original perspective by fo-
cusing on where viruses thrive. A rst series of lectures
will present virus outbreaks in the wild, ranging from
'classical' topics (ebola in humans) to more unusual
viruses (viruses infecting Archae or viruses infecting...
viruses). A second series of lectures will present exper-
imental results on outbreaks, with a particular focus
on bacteriophages, which are particularly amenable to
experimental evolution approaches. Finally, the third
series of lectures will focus on deciphering the dynami-
cal processes that can lead to outbreaks of new viruses.
Overall, this conference stands out as one of the few
that gathers researchers, who use dierent approaches
(molecular biology, experimental evolution, mathemati-
cal modeling) and work on viruses infecting a wide vari-
ety of hosts (animals, plants, bacteria, Archae, viruses)
but who are all interested in virus emergence.

\Woodpeckers in a Changing World - 7th International
Woodpecker Conference" (Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain, 23-
26 February 2014) has been extended to the 5th of Jan-
uary 2014.
On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we are pleased
to announce the 7th International Woodpecker Confer-
ence. As usual, these international woodpecker con-
ferences aim at bringing together researchers, conser-
vationists and forest managers from across the globe.
The title of the planned conference is \Woodpeckers in
a Changing World", which shows that we strive to dis-
cuss threats to and opportunities for woodpeckers in the
face of global change and debates over forest manage-
ment and energy policies currently taking place at EU
and international institutions. In addition, this confer-
ence aims to promote an international forum for dis-
cussion on how woodpecker research may improve our
understanding of behaviour, ecology and conservation
sciences.
The conference is embedded within an EU-LIFE project
(Pro-Izki) that focuses on the development of actions
for the conservation of the Pyrenean oak forest of Izki
(North Spain) and their associated species.
The conference is organized by The Provincial Coun-
cil of ~Alava and Hazi Foundation, the two partners in-
volved in the management of LIFE+ Pro-Izki. More-
over, the conference follows the path of previous con-
ferences on woodpeckers organized by the Woodpecker
Working Group of the German Ornithological Society,
which launched the initiative and will hold its 25th
meeting in Vitoria-Gasteiz. These three organizations
work in partnership to generate a pleasant atmosphere
that leads to fruitful exchange of information among
researchers of this fascinating avian group.

Conference description
The Cooperation and Conict in the Family conference
will be held at UNSW in Sydney, Australia from Febru-
ary 2-5 2014. It brings together leading economic and
evolutionary researchers to explore the nature of con-
ict and cooperation between the sexes in the areas of
marriage, mating and fertility. The conference provides
an opportunity for researchers to discuss the economic
and evolutionary biology approaches to these issues, ex-
plore common ground and identify collaborative oppor-
tunities. Areas of interest include:
Conict in mating: How does conict between the re-
productive interests of men and women aect mating
markets and sexual strategies?
Fertility: How is the fertility decision made in mar-
riage? What are the trade-os between quality and
quantity of children? What factors are behind the de-
mographic transition and low fertility of the modern
era?
Investment: How do the competing interests of men and
women aect parenting behaviour, work and household
decisions?
Economics and evolutionary biology have a rich his-
tory of analysis of cooperation and conict in the fam-
ily. Evolutionary biology sources the beginnings of this
analysis to the work of Darwin in the mid to late 19th-
century, while the economic study of the family has
origins that are more recent, dating to the late 1950s.
Since then, however, a strong tradition has emerged of
the application of the economic approach to fertility,
marriage, mating markets and investment in the qual-
ity and quantity of children.
While the ground being explored is common, the eco-
nomic and evolutionary approaches are rarely recon-
ciled. Particularly, the concepts of tness and utility,
which lie at the heart of evolutionary biology and eco-
nomics, have not been unied across the disciplines.
Fitness provides a basis for the emergence of traits
and preferences, while in an economic utility framework
they are assumed.
Cooperation and Conict in the Family seeks to bridge
these concepts. In recent decades, understanding of
family dynamics has been revolutionised by parallel
insights in evolution (sexual conict theory) and eco-January 1, 2014 EvolDir 11

A MMEMS workshop: Systems Biology of Drug Resis-

This message is to inform you of an inter-disciplinary
meeting funded by EPSRC on the theme of drug resis-
tance, to be held on Mon, Tue, Wed 19-21st May, 2014
in UNAM, Mexico ( http://www.morelos.unam.mx ).
The euphemistic term 'emergence' is often used in
medicine to describe the evolutionary processes by
which living systems acquire resistance to chemother-
apy. The purpose of this meeting is to understand clin-
ical resistance from the perspective that it is best un-
derstood, and therefore controlled, if we adopt an evo-
lutionary perspective from the start.
Reecting the importance of the dierent disciplines
needed to tackle the problem of drug resistance evo-
lution, our invited speakers represent a wide range of
methodological approaches.
With an emphasis on the relevance to past but also
potential future clinical studies, speakers will address
dierent aspects of the resistance problem. Topics for
discussion include antibiotic discovery (JL), antibiotic
stewardship in the clinic (JI), rapid pathogen diagnosis
(DP), bioinformatics approaches to clinical resistance
adaptation (TaLi), reduced-dose trials using malaria in
vivo models (AR), in vitro models of resistance adap-
tation (MB) studied using ideas from systems biology
(IG, TLu), in addition to theoretical, epidemiological
modelling (CCC).

BielefeldU MarineMammalEvolution
PhD studentship in marine mammal evolutionary ge-
nomics
Supervisors: Dr Joe Homan (Bielefeld University,
Germany) and Dr Jaume Forcada (British Antarctic
Survey, UK)
Many studies of wild populations reveal links between
heterozygosity and tness, with highly heterozygous in-
dividuals carrying fewer parasites, living longer and be-
ing more attractive to mates. However, because most
studies use only around ten microsatellite markers, we
do not yet know which of two possible mechanisms is
most important nor which types of gene could be in-
volved. This studentship will take full advantage of
emerging next-generation technologies to elucidate the
relationship between heterozygosity and tness in a
natural vertebrate system based on a large body of ge-
netic and observational data from an intensively studied
colony of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella).January 1, 2014 EvolDir 17
The objective is to determine the main mechanism(s)
responsible for heterozygosity-tness correlations using
a combination of high-density SNP genotyping, linkage
mapping and comparative genomics.
We seek a bright and highly motivated student who
ideally holds an M.Sc. or equivalent in a relevant
topic (e.g. population, evolutionary or conservation
genetics, bioinformatics). Experience of working with
next generation sequence data (including writing cus-
tom scripts), SNP discovery and genotyping (includ-
ing RAD sequencing and high-density SNP arrays)
and quantitative genetics (including linkage mapping)
would be advantageous, but full training will be pro-
vided. The ideal candidate will also be able to work
both independently and as part of a team. A high stan-
dard of spoken and written English is required.
The student will be based at the Department of
Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University (www.uni-
bielefeld.de/biologie/vhf/index.html). The department
is the oldest of its kind in Germany and currently hosts
six principal investigators, seven postdocs and twenty
PhD students. It oers a stimulating international en-
vironment and an excellent research infrastructure in-
cluding a brand new molecular laboratory. The work-
ing language of the Department is English. The student
will also have the opportunity to interact with cooper-
ation partners (Prof Jon Slate and Dr Jochen Wolf)
through placements at Sheeld and Uppsala Universi-
ties respectively.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with an attrac-
tive historical centre and easy access to the Teutoberger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It oers
a very high standard of living and is well connected to
most major European cities.
This generous studentship, which provides a net salary
of at least euro 1500 per month and includes health
insurance, is funded by the German Science Founda-
tion (DFG) for a period of three years. Funding is also
available for attending conferences. To apply for the
position, please provide: (i) a letter of motivation in-
cluding a maximum 2-page statement of your research
interests, relevant skills and experience; (ii) a CV in-
cluding publication list; and (iii) names and contact de-
tails of three referees willing to write condential letters
of recommendation. All materials should be emailed as
a single PDF le to: joseph.homan@uni-bielefeld.de
with 'PhD application' in the subject line.
The University of Bielefeld is an equal opportunity
employer. We particularly welcome applications from
women. Given equal suitability, qualications and pro-
fessional achievement, women will be given preference,
unless particular circumstances pertaining to a maleapplicant apply.
The application deadline is January 10th 2014 and in-
terviews will take place shortly afterwards. The pre-
ferred start date is exible and will depend on the
timeframe of the most qualied applicant. For further
information, please see http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/-

Project: Population genetics at Y-linked and adaptive
markers in delphinid Cetaceans
Supervisors: A. Rus Hoelzel (University of Durham) &
Per Berggren (University of Newcastle)
Most dolphin species are highly social and important
predator species in marine ecosystems. Understanding
the evolution of diversity among dolphin populations
is important towards their eective conservation and
management, and requires information on factors that
promote phylopatry, which may be dierent for males
and females. It also requires an understanding of habi-
tat dependencies and local adaptation. In spite of high
dispersal potential, many dolphin species show popu-
lation genetic structure over a small geographic scale
for neutral genetic markers, indicating dierentiation
by drift. Patterns of connectivity depend in part on
dispersal strategies that will depend on factors such
as social structure, group size, reproductive strategy,
habitat dependence and inbreeding avoidance. The pri-
mary objectives of the project will be to use genomicdata to test hypotheses about dierential dispersal in
males and females, about how the relevant processes
and emergent patterns depend on ecological specialisa-
tions (ecotypes), and hypotheses about dierential se-
lection for functional loci associated with physiological
dierences among ecotypes.
Applications now accepted through January 20th V

PlantEvolutionaryGenomics
PhD Student Position in Plant Evolutionary Genomics
(3 years) in the Plant Ecological Genetics group at
ETH Zurich, Switzerland, funded by a grant from ETH
Zurich to Dr. Thomas St adler (PI) and Prof. Alex
Widmer.
We seek a highly motivated PhD student to join our
research program on the population genomics and evo-
lution of postzygotic reproductive isolation in wild
tomato species (Solanum section Lycopersicon). The
particular focus of this newly-funded project builds on
pilot data that identify numerous candidate imprinted
genes (expression data from isolated endosperm tissue)
and genes dierently expressed in within-species ver-
sus hybrid endosperm. We anticipate that the suc-
cessful candidate will perform controlled crosses, har-
vest endosperm tissue via cryodissection, and then uses
Illumina sequencing to characterize endosperm tran-
scriptomes. Additionally, he/she will assess patterns
of DNA polymorphism and divergence for candidate
imprinted genes in outcrossing versus selng tomato
species.
We oer a stimulating scientic environment and rst-
rate computational and molecular facilities. Our group
is international in composition, with all group meet-
ings, seminars etc. being held in English. The
main study organisms in other (non-tomato) research
projects are species of Silene and Brassicaceae (see
http://www.peg.ethz.ch). Zurich is a cosmopolitan
small city oering outstanding quality of life as well
as a vibrant academic community (both ETH and Uni-
versity of Zurich). Starting date should be as soon as
possible and no later than 1 April 2014.
Applicants for this position should have a Master de-January 1, 2014 EvolDir 19
gree (or equivalent) in molecular population genet-
ics/genomics, plant biology, or computational biology.
A background in molecular population genetics and/or
plant developmental biology is highly desirable, and fa-
miliarity with next-generation sequencing data sets (Il-
lumina platform) and their bioinformatic analyses are
denite assets. Good quantitative, analytical, and En-
glish skills are essential, as is the ability to work inde-
pendently.
Applicants should submit a single PDF le by e-mail
with the following items:
* A cover letter with a brief summary of previous re-
search experience and professional motivation * Cur-
riculum Vitae * Copies of degree certicates and list of
coursework, including grades * Names, addresses and
e-mails of two professional references
Applications received by 24 January 2014 are assured of
full consideration, but the position remains open until
lled. Please send inquiries and applications to

(IGB) in Berlin together with the Free University of
Berlin, invite applications for the position of:
*PhD student in Evolutionary Biology*
*Application deadline: 15.02.2014*; Starting date:
May 2014, or as soon as possible thereafter (interviews
will be conducted in March); Duration of the position:
3 years
Project title: *\Evolutionary responses to a global
change"*
The PhD student will join the research group of Justyna
Wolinska. The group is currently located at the Ludwig
Maximilian University of Munich (Germany) but will
move to Berlin in March 2014. He / she will study the
evolutionary responses of communities and populations
which may result from manipulated experimental con-
ditions (i.e. global stressors), using cladoceran *Daph-
nia*as a model system. The student will also study
the impact of manipulated conditions on the spread of
infectious diseases and host-parasite coevolution (using
*Daphnia* and their microparasites as a model host-
parasite system).
This project is part of a research initiative around a
large experimental setup located at Lake Stechlin near
Berlin. \Lake Lab" (http://www.lake-lab .de/) consists
of 24 experimental lake-water basins each 9 metres in
diameter and around 20 metres deep, all isolated from
the rest of the lake. In these experimental cylinders,
future climatic scenarios are simulated and their eects
on the lake studied. The overarching goal of this large
research initiative is to nd out if and how biodiversity
will be aected as a result of climate change.
The PhD student will be involved in screening temporal
changes in *Daphnia*populations using microsatellites
and SNP markers, and he / she will study changes in
gene expression of *Daphnia* induced by environmen-
tal conditions. Moreover, the PhD student will track
temporal variation in parasite populations using NGS.22 EvolDir January 1, 2014
Depending on the interest of the student, he / she can
be further involved in eld and / or experimental work.

BeeBehaviour
PhD project on social insect behaviour available at
Royal Holloway Closing date: 24th January 2014 5pm
Title: Urban bees: communication, foraging and sur-
vival in cities
Supervisor: Dr Elli Leadbeater (Royal Holloway Uni-
versity of London) Co-supervisor: Dr. Richard Gill(Imperial College)
Bee pollination is enormously important to worldwide
food production, and widely-reported threats to bee
welfare have attracted global concern. Yet, evidence
suggests that bees may be faring surprisingly well in an
environment that would seem barren: the urban sprawl.
Urban beekeeping is on the rise, and there is growing ev-
idence that oral oases in cities can support surprisingly
high pollinator diversity. But although this might pro-
vide insight into conservation strategies, we do not fully
understand how urban bees adapt to their modern habi-
tat. This four-year project will take a colony-based ap-
proach to compare the behaviour of bees from colonies
placed in rural and urban environments, focussing par-
ticularly on waggle dance recruitment to food.
The successful applicant will be based at Royal Hol-
loway University of London in the research group of
Dr. Elli Leadbeater, and will be co-supervised by
Dr. Richard Gill at Imperial College. Royal Hol-
loway has an active and exciting research environ-
ment, and the department is currently ranked 6th in
the UK for research excellence. We have a thriving
core of researchers interested in social insect behaviour
and evolution. Experimental work will involve eld-
based behavioural experiments on bee colonies in the
spring and summer, and laboratory-based studies dur-
ing the winter. The project also includes a 3-month
placement at a non-academic host institute, the na-
ture of which will depend upon the student's inter-
ests but may involve the media or conservation char-
ities. Pre-application informal enquiries are strongly
encouraged. Please direct these to Dr. Elli Leadbeater
(Elli.Leadbeater@rhul.ac.uk).
Eligibility and Application Procedure All candidates
should hold, or be expecting to gain by July, a 1st
class or 2.1 BSc degree, or an MSc, in a suitable bi-
ological subject. Evidence of enthusiasm for research
and a strong interest in animal behaviour will be an
advantage, as will experience of eld or lab-based be-
havioural experiments. The UK Biotechnology and Bi-
ological Science Research Council rules require that suc-
cessful applicants must have appropriate UK residence
eligibility (permanent right of abode in the UK). More
details and an application form are available at:

NSF-funded Research Assistantship
Applications for graduate students in the lab of Jeremy
M. Brown at Louisiana State University (LSU) are now
being accepted for Fall 2014 admission. Research in
the Brown lab is broadly centered on the use of a
phylogenetic perspective to understand organismal his-
tory and molecular evolution. We work on both em-
pirical and methodological questions, often involving
the development of novel statistical and computational
approaches. Recent and ongoing empirical work in-
cludes large-scale studies of vertebrate phylogeny, the
use of phylogenies as forensic tools in criminal cases of
HIV transmission, and investigations into somatic di-
versication during tumor development. Recent and
ongoing methodological work focuses on the develop-
ment and testing of statistical approaches for phy-
logenomics and the interpretation/visualization of phy-
logenetic information in massive sets of trees. Ex-
tensive opportunities exist for collaboration and co-
advising with other outstanding evolutiona ry genet-
ics labs at LSU (including those of Robb Brumeld,
Mike Hellberg, Chris Austin, Jake Esselstyn, Prosanta
Chakrabarty, Maheshi Dassanayake, and Cameron
Thrash among others). An interest in programming,
computation, and/or statistics is encouraged, but no
specic prior background is required. Incoming stu-
dents will join a highly collaborative and interactive
group of researchers: http://www.phyleaux1.lsu.edu/-
?q=node/8 . A research assistantship is currently avail-
able through a recent grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation (http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID62571). The funded project aims
to interpret, extract, and visualize the phylogenetic sig-
nal contained in collections of phylogenetic trees using
network analyses. The project is collaborative with Jim
Wilgenbusch and Kyle Gallivan at Florida State. Stu-
dent involvement in this project could involve empirical
analyses and/or software development.All accepted students are guaranteed funding through
research and/or teaching assistantships. Some ex-
cellent fellowship opportunities are also available for
highly qualied applicants through the Louisiana Board
of Regents (http://web.laregents.org/programs/borsf-
programs/graduate-fellows/).
LSU's Dept. of Biological Sciences has a particu-
lar strength in computational evolutionary genetics.
LSU continues to invest heavily in the computational
sciences, with a recent focus on computational bi-
ology. Outstanding resources are available through
the Center for Computation and Technology (http://-
www.cct.lsu.edu/home) and the Louisiana Optical Net-
work Initiative (http://www.loni.org/).
Baton Rouge is located in South Louisiana, one of the

Queen Mary U, London
Applications are invited from all nationalities for
a funded PhD Studentship starting September 2014
within the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) in the eld
of cultural evolution.
Background. Cultural evolution is a relatively new
eld in which the tools and concepts of evolution-
ary biology are applied to the historical dynamics of
human artifacts. The goal of this PhD is to study
the emergence of musical styles, and their causes, in
an evolutionary framework. See, for example, our
\Evolution of Music by Public Choice" (MacCallum et
al., PNAS, 2012, http://www.pnas.org/content/early/-
2012/06/12/1203182109)
Specics. Depending on skills and inclination, the suc-
cessful candidate will (1) focus on studying the evolu-
tionary dynamics in existing datasets, estimating, for
example, patterns of selection on musical traits and
their transmission dynamics; or (2) develop robust au-
dio feature extractors and music data mining methods
for their application to particular bodies of music.
Supervision. The candidate will be supervised by
Dr Matthias Mauch (http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/-
people/view/2932/dr-matthias-mauch) and will join a
group of around 60 full-time PhD students, post-
doctoral researchers and academics in the C4DM
(http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). The candidate will re-
ceive further advice on the study of evolution from ex-
ternal advisor Prof. Armand Leroi at Imperial College.
Skills. Candidates should have a rst class honours
degree or equivalent and/or a strong MSc degree in
computer science, mathematics, physics, bioinformat-
ics, evolutionary biology or engineering. Good pro-
gramming skills in either Matlab, R, Python or similar26 EvolDir January 1, 2014
are essential, as is a passion for music. Knowledge of
machine learning/data mining methods is desirable, but
not essential if the candidate otherwise demonstrates
good technical/mathematical skills.
Two sources of funding are available: An EPSRC stu-
dentship is available to candidates with UK residency.
This studentship is for 3.5 years and will cover stu-
dent fees and a tax-free stipend starting at $15,720
per annum. Full details and eligibility conditions can
be found at http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/-
help/Pages/eligibility.aspx .Candidates should state if
they are eligible for this studentship. An International
studentship is available to candidates without UK res-
idency and is for 3 years. This studentship covers stu-
dent fees and a tax-free stipend of $15,720 per annum.
Please apply on-line at http://www.qmul.ac.uk/-

restricted to UK residents, see below
Project description:
Many organisms are currently responding to climate
changes with dramatic range shifts involving evolution-
ary responses. Among the organisms most strongly af-
fected by changing climates are small, exothermic an-
imals such as insects, which can evolve rapidly and
quickly disperse into available niches, often posing new
threats to food security (as crop or stored-food pests),
human and animal welfare (as disease vectors), and af-
fecting overall ecosystem function.
The mechanisms of niche evolution and range shift un-
der rapidly changing climates remain poorly under-
stood. In this PhD project, the student will investi-
gate a number of hypothetical evolutionary trajecto-
ries that could underlie rapid shifts in resource use and
climatic tolerances observed during range expansions.
Using experimental evolution and crossing experiments
in a captive-bred colony of seed beetles (Coleoptera:
Bruchidae, a global stored-crop pest), combined with
in silico modeling approaches, the student will investi-
gate conditions producing alternative evolutionary sce-
narios, and the quantitative genetic/genomic basis of
niche divergence under each scenario. Project outputs
will inform management of evolving pest species, and
will contribute to evolutionary theory.
We will provide training in experimental evolu-
tion, quantitative genetic and genomic methods, and
individual-based modelling approaches. Applicants are
encouraged to establish contact with Dr Lesley Lan-
caster (lesleylancaster@abdn.ac.uk) during the applica-

Population structure and local adaptation in commer-
cially important European shellsh
Supervisors: Dr. Joe Homan (Bielefeld University,
Germany), Dr Liz Harper (Cambridge University, UK)
and Dr Melody Clark (British Antarctic Survey, UK)
There is mounting concern over the acidication of the
World's oceans. In the 250 years since the onset of the
industrial revolution, atmospheric CO2 levels have risen
from 280 to 381 ppm and ocean pH has fallen from an
average 8.16 to 8.05. Human-driven emissions of CO2
continue to rise and have begun to outstrip even the
most pessimistic of IPCC model scenarios. How will
life in the oceans adapt to this changing environment?
Particular concern has been expressed over organisms
with heavily calcied shells such as molluscs, as their
ability to extract carbonate ions from seawater and in-
corporate these into their skeletons may be increasingly
compromised.
This PhD position forms part of a Marie Curie Ini-
tial Training Network entitled CACHE: Calcium in a
Changing Environment, funded by the EU (ref: 605051)
and co-ordinated by the British Antarctic Survey. The
aim of this network is to take a co-ordinated multidisci-
plinary approach to understanding calcium regulation
and shell production in four commercially important
shellsh species, the king scallop (Pecten maximus),
the Pacic oyster, (Crassostrea gigas), the blue mussel(Mytilus edulis) and the soft shell clam (Mya arenaria).
The network comprises 10 partners from 6 European
countries, including research institutes, universities and
SMEs. As a member of the network, the student will
be expected to work co-operatively within the network,
participate in European training events and spend up
to 30% of their training with another network partner.
Full details of the network can be found at www.cache-
ITN.eu . The PhD project will use high-density SNP
genotyping to examine the population genetic structure
of the four shellsh species along a European latitudi-
nal cline. The resulting data will be interpreted in the
light of both life-history variation and oceanography,
and will be analysed together with shell morphologi-
cal data to explore the extent of phenotypic plasticity.
Candidate genes involved in calcium regulation and de-
position will also be assayed to test for ngerprints of
natural selection.
We seek a bright and highly motivated student who
ideally holds an M.Sc. or equivalent in a relevant topic
(e.g. population, evolutionary or conservation genet-
ics, bioinformatics). The student will be responsible
for developing a bioinformatic pipeline to analyse Illu-
mina Restriction Site Associated DNA (RAD) sequence
data. Experience of installing and working with Linux
systems, analysing high-throughput sequence data and
writing custom scripts is therefore highly desirable, al-
though full training can be provided. The ideal candi-
date will also be able to work both independently and
as part of a multidisciplinary team. A high standard of
spoken and written English is required.
The student will be based at the Department of
Animal Behaviour at Bielefeld University (www.uni-
bielefeld.de/biologie/vhf/index.html). The department
is the oldest of its kind in Germany and currently hosts
six principal investigators, seven postdocs and twenty
PhD students. It oers a stimulating international en-
vironment and an excellent research infrastructure in-
cluding a brand new molecular laboratory. The working
language of the Department is English.
Bielefeld is a city of 325,000 inhabitants with an attrac-
tive historical centre and easy access to the Teutoberger
Wald for hiking and other outdoor pursuits. It oers
a very high standard of living and is well connected to
most major European cities.
To apply for the position, please provide: (i) a letter of
motivation including a maximum 2-page statement of
your research interests, relevant skills and experience;
(ii) a CV including publication list; (iii) names and con-

*/Rationale/*: Both climate change and land use (agri-
culture) are recognized as a major problem in fresh-
water, estuarine and coastal environments, leading to
eutrophication (organic pollution) and ecosystem dam-
age. However, although the loss of water quality is
recognized for its impact on ecosystem functioning and
economy, one of the major issues for all types of agri-
cultural practices and land use (classied as non-point
source pollution by the EU and US Environmental Pro-tection Agency) is that they are not easily measured or
controlled directly and therefore are dicult to regu-
late. The PhD student will measure the temperature
related changes that can lead to eutrophication as well
as study the eect of pesticides on ecosystem function-
ing. The approach optimized for these two stressors can
be extended to other environmental stressors, making
the proposed research of high impact.

UBristol EvolutionPollinators
PhD Position: Traits and drivers of declines in UK pol-
linators
University of Bristol, UK & Centre for Ecology and
Hydrology, Wallingford, UK. Application deadline: 9th
January 2014, via the GW4+ DTP website. http:/-
/www.bris.ac.uk/gw4plusdtp/apply/ Pollinating in-
sects provide life-support services for biodiversity,
ecosystems and food production by securing reproduc-
tion for c75% of food crops and 94% of ower plants.
Widespread declines of many (but not all) species of in-
sect pollinators have been reported recently, provoking
serious concerns over future food security and ecosys-
tem services. We understand little about macro-scale
patterns (the traits and the drivers) of pollinator de-
clines. Is who you are more important than where you
are?
Recent research reveals how a range of anthropocen-
tric pressures (e.g. pesticide use, climate change, in-
tensive agriculture) may be driving declines in these
species. But there is clearly variation in pollinator pop-
ulations across and within species, with some species
doing badly, but others doing well.
This studentship will determine which traits explain
this variation. Species-specic traits such as tongue
length, body size, life cycle, sociality & behavioural
plasticity are all candidates for explaining the variation
in pollinator declines. Much of the research to date has
focused on social insect pollinators (particularly hon-
eybees and bumblebees), yet these species represent
a small fraction pollinator diversity in the UK: much
of the pollination services are delivered by non-social
Diptera, Lepidoptera and solitary bees. Further, are
these biological traits better predictors of status than
extrinsic factors, such as climate, land-use or the local
intensity of pesticide use?
The student will exploit existing datasets of species
occurrence (e.g. from data collected by volunteers
(e.g. BWARS), professional surveys (Hymettus) and
research council grants), assemble a comprehensivedatabase of pollinator traits, and test hypotheses about
the species' traits and environmental drivers of pollina-
tor declines. This project, therefore, will reveal the
importance of biological traits and extrinsic factors ef-
fecting population abundance across the range of insect
pollinators, and make an important contribution to pol-
icy and predicting future delivery of pollination services
under a range of environmental and land-use scenarios.
This is a collaborative, cross-disciplinary project, in-
volving pollinator researchers at Bristol (Seirian Sum-
ner & Jane Memmott), macroecologists at Centre
for Ecology and Hydrology (Nick Isaac) and pro-
fessional insect collections and survey organisations

Pesticide \hang-overs" and social disruption in pollina-
tor societies
University of Bristol, UK & University of Bath, UK Ap-
plication deadline: 9th January 2014, via the SWDTP
webpage http://www.bris.ac.uk/swdtp/apply/ Insect
pollinators are essential for our food security. The re-
cent global declines of key pollinators are therefore of
great concern for global food production. The social
bees are one of the most important crop pollinators,
with their services valued at over $200billion per year.
One major concern is whether pesticide use is responsi-
ble for the observed declines in pollinator populations.
We lack essential mechanistic understanding of how
pesticides disrupt insect behaviour, from genes to phe-
notype. This studentship will explore how pesticides
disrupt social behaviours and colony-level interaction
networks in pollinator societies, and whether such so-
cial disruption leads to suboptimal colony performance.
Exposure to pesticides may impair the ability of indi-
viduals to interact, communicate and cooperate with
their colony mates. There may be transient eects
of individual-level exposure on colony function which
'end-point' studies miss. For example, what colony-
level impact does a pesticide 'hang-over' have, where
individuals may be aected for only a short time pe-
riod after exposure? Finally, we know nothing about
the genes associated with changes in behaviour after
pesticide exposure.
The student will use a combination of behavioural ex-periments on bumble-bee colonies and social network
analyses address these questions. The student will also
have the opportunity to identify the changes in brain
gene expression that occur during disruption of social
behaviour. This project will reveal the functional ef-
fects of pesticides on these important pollinators, from
gene to individual to colony level. It will thus deliver
substantial impact in providing the science base for the
future of sustainable agriculture in a world with grow-
ing food demands.
This is a collaborative, inter-disciplinary project, with
high-level training in four elds: behavioural biology,
pollinator research and genomics (Bristol - Seirian Sum-
ner & Heather Whitney, School of Biological Sciences),
and computational biology and mathematics (Bath -

UCapeTown BirdPathogenEvolution
PhD opportunity at the University of Cape Town, De-
partment of Biological Sciences.
Project: Pathogen landscapes in endemic bird pollina-
tors of the Cape Floral Kingdom
This project aims to understand (i) the pathogen pres-
sures experienced by habitat-generalist and habitat-
specialist bird pollinators across a natural / urban /
agricultural landscape matrix, and (ii) test the rolesJanuary 1, 2014 EvolDir 33
that pathogens are likely to play in a future of contract-
ing habitat availability and decreasing connectivity.
Research into the role of pathogens in host ecology and
evolution has grown in recent decades and the advent
of PCR-based methods now allows us greater insight
into spatial patterns of pathogen pressure and diversity.
Avian haemosporidians are blood parasites responsible
for many diseases in domestic birds and their negative
eects on tness in wild bird populations are well es-
tablished. Parasitism can aect host survival and t-
ness, and much like predators and food availability, may
act to regulate host populations. In an age of global
change and human-transformed landscapes the role of
pathogens however remains poorly understood.
This project will involve collection of blood smears
from target species together with the use of PCR-based
methods to characterise infection intensity and preva-
lence of haemosporidian blood parasites. If your inter-
ests include the role of the Major Histocompatibility
Complex in pathogen landscapes there is exibility in
developing the methods used in the project to include
testing the role of selection at MHC class I loci in target
species.
The project is fully funded with an annual tax-exempt
R90 000 bursary for three years and associated running
costs. The successful applicant will have a strong un-
dergraduate academic record, an MSc degree in the Bi-
ological Sciences with relevant ornithological eld expe-
rience and be available to start early to mid 2014. This
project is part of a broader collaboration on Fynbos en-
demic birds and climate change between the Fitzpatrick
Institute for African Ornithology at UCT, the South
African National Biodiversity Institute and Birdlife SA.

Our lab has two main research themes. The rst re-
search theme focuses on the evolution of color pattern
and color vision and how this varies with environmen-36 EvolDir January 1, 2014
tal conditions. This line of research includes questions
about (a) the origins of female mating preferences, (b)
the maintenance of genetic variation in male color pat-
terns within populations, (c) the signicance of popula-
tion dierentiation in phenotypic plasticity in color pat-
tern, visual traits, and mating traits, and (d) the scale
of temporal and spatial variation in lighting conditions
and its eects on color pattern and color vision. Our
most recent work involves developing models of visual
detectability to determine how dierent species perceive
color patterns in dierent environments. Our second
research theme focuses on speciation and the extent to
which it is driven by natural selection to dierent envi-
ronmental conditions. This includes questions about
(a) whether reinforcement or adaptation to dierent
abiotic conditions (namely salinity) is important for
the evolution of behavioral isolation, (b) whether post-
zygotic isolation evolves more rapidly for taxa that in-
habit radically dierent environments, and (c) whether
genomic rearrangements contribute to the evolution of
reproductive isolation. Our most recent work here in-
volves measuring QTL for reproductive isolation and
examining genomic divergence between freshwater and
saltwater populations/species of killish. Students with
interest/experience in genomics are welcome to apply.
Students in the Fuller lab have worked on a variety of
shes including killishes in the genus Lucania, top-
minnows, and darters. Students are welcome to de-
velop their own research projects independent of the
main lab projects, but students may also collaborate
on aspects of the main lab projects that are of in-

ation in corticosterone and testosterone proles trans-
late into tness, whether hormone proles are heritable
and how plasticity in hormonal responses comes about.
Our main study species is the great tit, Parus ma-

Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen and

Project description
Quantitative genetic analyses of male and female extra-
pair mating behaviour in captive zebra nches have
shown that female indelity is positively genetically cor-
related with male sex drive (Forstmeier et al. 2011,
PNAS 108:10608). This means that males with high
sex drive will tend to sire daughters that are inclined
to engage in extra-pair mating. To verify and further
explore this nding we have established selection lines
that have been selected over three consecutive genera-
tions for high versus low breeding values for male sex
drive. The aim of the PhD project is to assess whether
rates of female extra-pair mating (and hence extra-pair
paternity) have indeed been altered by the indirect se-
lection pressure exerted on males. If females from lines
for high male sex-drive indeed show increased levels
of extra-pair paternity (compared to control and low
lines), the aim will be to characterize the behavioural
dierences among the selection lines (e.g. pair bond
strength, sexual arousal).

Genomic imprinting (GI) is the inactivation of one al-
lele in diploid individuals, with inactivation being de-
pendent upon the sex of the parent from which it was
derived. Natural selection is expected to favor expres-
sion of both alleles in order to protect against recessive
mutations that render a gene ineective. What, then,
is the benet of silencing one copy of a gene, making
the organism functionally haploid at that locus? Haigs
kinship theory is the current leading evolutionary ex-
planation.
Although current observations support the kinship the-
ory, there have been no independent tests. Eusocial Hy-
menoptera (ants, bees and wasps) are an ideal model
systems for making truly independent a priori tests of
the theory. Hymenoptera are haplodiploid, with diploid
females (queens and workers) arising from fertilized
eggs and haploid males arising from unfertilized eggs.January 1, 2014 EvolDir 39
This dierent genetic system combined with the shared
brood rearing and reproductive division of labour char-
acteristic of eusociality results in range of novel predic-
tions for the kinship theory.
One previous problem in using Hymenoptera to test
the conict theory was that they were not known to
have the mechanisms required for genomic imprinting.
In 2006, it was shown that Apis mellifera has a fully
functioning cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methy-
lation system. DNA methylation is one of the major
mechanisms of genomic imprinting in mammals and
angiosperms. The honeybee methylation system has
been shown to transmit epigenetic information. CpG
methylation has since been shown to be common in
hymenoptera and the Mallon lab have found it in bum-
blebees and shown it is invovled in traits predicted by
the kinship theory.
Aims and objectives: The major aim of this PhD is
to establish that genomic imprinting occurs in a more
tractable bee species, the bumblebee. Genomic im-
printing has not yet been discovered in insects and this
will be a major discovery.

PhD position
The role of host immune gene expression and gut mi-
crobiome in the anti-trypanosome response of an im-
portant insect pollinator
Supervisors: Dr Eamonn Mallon and Prof. Mike Barer
The insect immune system is hugely important to hu-
man health and wellbeing. Whether we consider the
immune response of a human disease vector, or the im-
mune system of an important crop pollinator defending
itself from parasites, an understanding of these systems
is vital. A recent development in this eld is the dis-
covery of the role of the commensual gut bacteria (gut
microbiota) in modulating the immune response of in-
sects to invading parasites.
How the insect gut microbiota help defend against par-
asites is largely unknown. The bumblebee Bombus
terrestris and its invading gut trypanosome Crithidia
bombi make an excellent model to tease out this pro-
cess. Using RNA-Seq the Mallon lab have found 471
bumblebee genes that are dierentially regulated upon
infection with Crithidia. The lab has begun the func-
tional analysis of these genes by knocking them down
using RNAi and seeing the eect on Crithidia levels. It
has also been found that gut microbiota are also im-
portant in this defence. When bacteria are removed
through antibiotics, bumblebees are much more highly
infected by Crithidia. If the gut microbiota is restored,
bumblebees show a normal level of Crithidia infection.
This PhD will begin by using RNA-Seq to understand
bumblebee gene expression changes in Crithidia in-
fected bees with and without their gut

Project title: Sociogenomics of ant social organisation
Department/School: Dept Biology, University of Le-

Supervisors: Dr Rob Hammond, Dept Biology, U of Le-
icester Dr Sandra Beleza, Dept Genetics, U of Leicester
Collaborator: Dr Richard Gill, Dept Life Sciences, Im-
perial College London
Project Overview:
The evolution of highly integrated social groups with a
reproductive division of labour, exemplied by the 'su-
perorganismal' eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, bees and
wasps), is a major transition in evolution oering un-
paralleled opportunities to understand how organiza-
tion at a higher level evolves and diversies. Until re-
cently little was known about genetic inuences on the
diversity of social organizations found in social insects
(the study of 'sociogenomics'). This is changing; next
generation sequencing (NGS) makes it possible to un-
derstand the genomic architecture underpinning vari-
ation in social organisation, and, in turn, the eects
social living has on the genome.
We propose an ambitious PhD investigating the popu-
lation genetics, phylogeography and genomic architec-
ture underlying a characterised polymorphism in social
organization in the slender ant, Leptothorax acervo-
rum. This common species has multiple mated queens
per colony but populations vary in how reproduction is
'skewed' between nest queens. Aims and objectives:
To characterize: (1) the phylogeography and popula-
tion genetic structure of L. acervorum from southern
European populations using Restriction site Associated
DNA sequencing (RADseq)5, and (2) the social or-
ganisation (reproductive skew) in these populations us-
ing microsatellite genotyping and queen dissections (to
measure ovary development). To use these data: (1)
to test whether changes in social organization are ex-
plained by range expansion, and (2) to identify genomic
regions potentially under selection using population ge-
netic techniques.

Project: Genetic basis of divergent and convergent evo-
lution in Neotropical bats Supervisor: Stephen Rossiter
(Queen Mary University of London)
Our recent work has focused on identifying molecular
adaptations associated with the evolution of echoloca-
tion in bats and dolphins. In particular, we have shown
that these two groups of divergent taxa have undergone
numerous identical amino acid substitutions in multiple
genes implicated in hearing and vision [1].
I am now seeking a motivated and highly able PhD
student to build on this work. In particular, this PhD
project will seek to elucidate the genetic basis of di-
vergent and convergent evolution in a major group of
Neotropical bats. These bats have undergone an ex-
traordinary adaptive radiation linked to dietary diver-
sication [e.g. ref. 2], from blood eating vampires to
nectar feeders and frugivores.
The project will combine bioinformatics and evolution-
ary analyses, and so experience in both of these is es-
sential. Fieldwork in the tropics is optional but not
compulsory.January 1, 2014 EvolDir 41

ULondon GenomicArchitectureIn-
tragenomicConict
The following 2 PhD Projects are on oer at Royal Hol-
loway University of London
Life history and genome architecture
The organization and architecture of the genome has
been shaped by natural selection. There is abundant
evidence that many genomes contain parts which wereacquired from other organisms. Examples are viruses,
which have integrated in the genetic material in a cell,
and plasmids found in bacteria. The most striking ex-
amples are the acquisition of the genomes of organelles
such as chromoplasts and mitochondria, which have
originated from a fusion of cells.
One fundamental question regarding genome architec-
ture is why, and how, natural selection favours indi-
vidual genes to cluster into nuclear genomes, and what
type of genes were selected to cluster. In this theo-
retical project we will use mathematical and computer
models to investigate this question.
When two genomes are brought together conicts may
arise. For the host cells, the new genome could con-
tain benecial traits, as well as detrimental traits, for
instance bacterial viruses often carry genes which al-
low bacteria to survive and multiply, but these same
viruses can lyse the bacterial cell. For the invading
genome there is a tension between fully integrating in
their hosts' genome and optimizing the transmission
together with the host but in doing so giving up the
possibility of independent transmission.
What we aim to investigate in this project is how se-
lection has acted on these genes, and whether selection
would favour genes to cluster into a nuclear genome, or
not.
Intra-genomic Conict and Medical Disorders Intra-
genomic conict dees the logic of natural selection:
why would natural selection favor any gene whose ex-
pression reduces the tness of its host? However intra-
genomic conict has left its signature in many molecu-
lar mechanisms. A paradigmatic example of evolution
driven by intra-genomic conict is the case of genomic
imprinting where conict between paternally inherited
and maternally inherited genes in the same individual
results in silencing of one gene but not the other.
Recently, genomic imprinting (and intra-genomic con-
ict in general) has been linked to several diseases. For
example, deletion of the PWS/AS cluster of imprinted
genes causes Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) when the
deletion is paternally inherited but Angelman syndrome
(AS) when it is maternally inherited. The clinical phe-
notype, regarding appetite and activity levels, of chil-
dren suering from these syndromes is the reverse: poor
sucking and low weight in children with PWS but insa-
tiable appetite and obesity in children with AS.
This intriguing reversal of the clinical phenotype of a
deletion is best explained in the light of conict be-
tween genes with dierent parental origin. In particu-
lar, it can be explained when paternally inherited copies
favor a greater allocation of maternal resources to o-42 EvolDir January 1, 2014
spring than the maternally inherited copy does. We are
interested in further exploring the role of intra-genomic
conict in disease. Can we predict the risk of develop-
ing diseases caused by genes in conict? Can we suggest
epigenetic modications that may palliate some symp-
toms?

open for competitive applications.
Project: Movement ecology and adaptive potential ofloggerhead sea turtle
Supervisors: Dr. Christophe Eizaguirre (Queen Mary,
University of London) & Dr. Chris Harrod (Queen
Mary, University of London)
Under the scenario of changing oceans, identifying the
eects of physical and chemical variation on biodiver-
sity has become a central question in Conservation Bi-
ology. One of the direct and pervasive threats facing
marine ecosystems is the global decline of large ma-
rine vertebrates such as Sea Turtles. This is because
of the important roles these large consumers play in
maintaining the structure and functioning of their habi-
tats. Conserving turtles is therefore more than a sin-
gle species protection. Here, we oer to characterize
the habitat used by the loggerhead turtles nesting in
Cape Verde. Using state of the art isotope analyses,
molecular techniques and satellite transmitters, we aim
to determine the characteristics of the habitats used
by the turtles and hence dene how on-going climate
change may aect their distribution and adaptive po-
tential. Results will have direct impacts on conserva-
tion measures taken to protect this species.
Eligibility: UK nationals and residents for full scholar-

UNottingham SnailSpeciation
Funding is available for a four year BBSRC DTP PhD
studentship (deadline 5th January), to be awarded on
a competitive basis within the University of Notting-
ham, to investigate the speciation of snails using next
generation DNA sequencing methods
Speciation on a snail's scale
Snails and slugs are a major crop pest, with a few in-
troduced species causing massive worldwide problems.
They are dicult to identify, and part of the second
most species-rich animal group - yet we have no good
idea of how this biodiversity has come about. This
project will use next generation sequencing methods
to investigate the speciation of snails, especially with
respect to characters under natural and articial se-
lection (e.g. shell colour and banding or molluscide
resistance), and including methods that may help iden-
tify cryptic species. Although the precise nature of the
project will be determined by the state of play when
the project begins and the interests of the student, I
envisage that he/she will use mapping and expression
methods to home in on the genes in question. He/she
may also develop new species/models to study (possibly
involving eldwork in Europe or Asia), enabling deeper
comparative analyses. The student will receive train-
ing in standard molecular lab methods, next generation
sequencing and bioinformatic methods.

UNottingham SticklebackSpeciationJanuary 1, 2014 EvolDir 45
Dear Colleagues
A competitively funded NERC PhD is available on
\Speciation and environmental change in sticklebacks"
at the University of Nottingham, cosupervised by my-
self, Dr Suzanne McGowan (Geography) and Dr Xu
Chen (China University of Geosciences). UK students
will be fully funded, EU applicants would qualify for
fees only. Other international applications cannot be
considered (sorry!).
It is widely accepted that environmental changes, like
relative sea level (RSL) uctuations, have eects on the
evolution of biodiversity. RSL uctuation could drive
speciation in aquatic systems by aecting their connect-
edness and salinity, but the details are poorly under-
stood because of the large time scales that are involved.
A multidisciplinary approach is needed to ascertain the
links between speciation and patterns of environmental
change.
Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are
originally marine sh commonly used to study evolution
because of their rapid adaptation to freshwater. North
Uist in the Scottish Western Isles comprises a mosaic
of interlinked freshwater and brackish lochs and la-
goons whose low-lying elevation makes their aquatic en-
vironments unusually susceptible to RSL change. The
contemporary distribution and phenotypic variation of
sticklebacks here suggest a link between speciation and
RSL change. Three main stickleback ecotypes are cur-
rently found on North Uist: 'freshwater' with reduced
bony armour, 'residents' with similar phenotypes, but
living year-round in brackish lagoons and 'anadromous'
heavily armoured marine sh that breed in lagoons (and
some low-lying freshwater lochs). The coexistence of
resident and anadromous ecotypes breeding in North
Uist lagoons (but not hybridising) is unique in Europe
and suggests that they have speciated, but it is unclear
how.
In this project, the student will make use of the fact
that in aquatic systems palaeolimnological information
about environmental change is stored in benthic sedi-
ments, while information about speciation can be in-
ferred from DNA. 'Training sets' that describe the re-
lationship between contemporary water chemistry and
diatoms will allow the student to reconstruct palaeolim-
nological environments and test hypotheses about how
their change drove speciation.
Aim: To determine the eect of past changes in RSL
on the speciation of sticklebacks using a combination of
palaeolimnological, genetic and contemporary ecologi-
cal data.
North Uist was covered in ice at the last glacial maxi-mum, and freshwater environments are less than 16,000
years old. Published reconstructions of RSL suggest
that the Western Isles have since experienced two peaks
of RSL, thousands of years apart, with an intervening
drop in sea level of several metres.
The student will test three hypotheses on the specia-
tion of North Uist sticklebacks: (1) Anadromous and
resident sh are ancient lineages that evolved before
the present interglacial and independently colonised the
North Uist lagoons. Predicts that the split between
them will be >16,000 years. (2) Speciation was sym-
patric. Predicts that anadromous and resident sh in
each lagoon will be each other's closest relatives, and
that lagoons have remained accessible from the sea. (3)
The two peaks in RSL facilitated a 'double-invasion'
by anadromous sticklebacks of lagoons that are close
to sea-level. Reversion of some lagoons to freshwater
between the peaks drove the rst wave of invaders to
evolve into residents, such that by the second RSL peak
and invasion the two waves did not recognise each other
as mates. Predicts particular patterns of RSL and salin-
ity change in lagoons.
Studentships will be awarded following a competitive
process within the 'ENVISION' NERC DTP consor-
tium. Applicants should hold a minimum of a UK Hon-
ours Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in a subject such
as Environmental Science, Geography or Zoology. Flex-
ibility to take on an interdisciplinary project, including
eldwork, molecular genetics, microscopy and diatom
taxonomy would be advantageous.

UReading FungalClockGenes
Project title: Investigating the molecular clock of Ver-
ticillium dahlia, its evolution, and its inuence on
pathogenicity
Department/School: Biological Sciences
Supervisors: Dr Louise Johnson, University of Reading
/ Dr Richard Harrison, EMR.
Project Overview: The classical fungal model of clock
genetics Neurospora crassa is in the same phylogentic
class as many economically important plant pathogens,
such as rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), strawberry wilt
(Verticillium dahliae) and various Fusarium species.
Functional clock genes can be identied in these
pathogens, however their role in pathogenicity is cur-
rently unclear. Plants exhibit dierential immunity to
disease dependent on the time of day that they are chal-
lenged. At the molecular level some pathogen-induced
genes are known to have diurnal expression patterns,
and recently defence genes have been shown to be un-
der the direct regulation of a central clock gene in Ara-
bidopsis1. This indicates that plants have variable re-
sistance levels to pathogens throughout the day. The
evolution of a clock-linked immune system suggests that
pathogens may also time aspects of host challenge, such
as spore release and ascospore germination. This is
likely to require a functional circadian clock, linked to
that of the host, integrating the same environmental
signals in order to optimise infection.
This project aims to identify components of a molecu-
lar clock within the fungal root pathogen of strawberry,
Verticillium dahliae, rstly by searching for homologs
to the known clock components of, Neurospora crassa
and secondly by gene expression studies to identify and
characterise diurnally expressed genes. The next step
will be to carry out phylogenetic analyses to elucidate
the processes of adaptation in clock genes.
The studentship is jointly funded by East Malling Re-
search and the University of Reading. The student will
be primarily based at EMR, Kent, but will have the
opportunity to spend time at Reading and benet from
training in a laboratory with dierent expertise.

sta/james-hartwell/ Distantly related groups of
organisms often converge on the same adaptive solu-
tion to an environmental challenge, thereby creating
ideal study systems to address fundamental questions
concerning the opportunities and constraints that
govern evolution. Lycopods and angiosperms that
co-occur in British lakes acquired similar growth habits
despite evolving independently for more than 400
million years. Moreover, both groups evolved the same
specialized mode of photosynthesis (CAM photosyn-
thesis) and the same developmental programme to
build leaves equipped with stomatal pores to succeed
in terrestrial environments. This PhD project will
address the following key question: Did both plant
lineages use the same genetic toolkits to evolve these
critical ecological adaptations to sub-mergent and
emergent lifestyles? The student will address this
question using massively parallel direct sequencing
techniques and bioinformatic tools. This comparative
work will shed new light on the importance of the
genomic background for the evolution of adaptive
novelties across land plants. The student will integrate
into thriving research groups, and the supervisors will
provide training in their elds of expertise, including
plant evolution, comparative genetics, eco-physiology,
and bioinformatics. Applications are invited from
candidates with interests in plant evolutionary biology,
comparative genetics and/or ecology.

*Evolution of new enzymatic functions: How did nature
build ecient enzymes for C4 photosynthesis?*
A four-years PhD position is available to start at the

Sciences (supervised by Dr Pascal-Antoine Christin)

chemistry/sta/proles/jim reid This project will
combine evolutionary investigations with biochemical
work to address the mechanisms that lead to the
functional diversication of enzymes. It will focus on
the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC),
which is encoded by a multigene family. Some of
the encoded PEPC have been co-opted for a function
in C4 photosynthesis, a novel trait that evolved
multiple times in owering plants [Sage et al., 2012].
Adaptation to the new catalytic context involved
adaptive changes in the coding sequence, several of
which were shared among independent origins of C4
photosynthesis, representing an exceptional example
of convergent evolution at the genetic level [Christin
et al., 2007; Besnard et al., 2009]. The eect of these
changes on the encoded enzymes remain however
poorly understood. This project aims to characterize
independently evolved C4 forms of PEPC as well
as closely related non-C4 enzymes. Analyses of the
enzymatic properties in a phylogenetic context will
shed new light on the forces that govern evolution at
the molecular level.

Consequences of life history variation for demographic
and phenological responses to environmental change
Supervisors: Luc Bussi ere (University of Stirling),
Philip Stephens (University of Durham), Mario Vallejo-
Marin (University of Stirling)
Although shifts in phenology (the timings of recurrent
biological phenomena) are among the clearest and best-
supported consequences of climate change, both the fac-
tors predicting phenological shifts and the community
consequences of such transitions remain far from clear.
Life history traits (which aect age-specic probabili-
ties of survival and reproduction) should play a central
role in phenological evolution, but we need research
that explores their possible contributions to interspe-
cic diversity in the timing, duration and rate of pro-
gression of developmental stages. Assessing the likely
consequences of phenological shifts for communities fur-
ther requires empirical assessments of how shifts in phe-
nology aect the tness of interacting symbionts, and
modelled simulations that explore the demographics of
participants under alternate climate change scenarios.This PhD project will assess whether phenological shifts
predictably dier among species characterized by con-
trasting life histories, and the consequences of such
shifts for the tness of symbionts. We focus on two
groups with extraordinary variation in life history traits
(hoveries and dance ies) who provide a valuable pol-
lination service to symbiotic owering plants (ies are
the main pollinators of many plants including mem-
bers of the family Brassicaceae). Many hovery adults
feed mainly on pollen and nectar (hence their value
as pollinators), but their larvae have tremendously di-
verse habits, ranging from lter feeders living within
rotting vegetation through to predaceous forms that de-
vour other insects. These dierences in larval diet could
change the sensitivity of species to phenological cues, or
alter adult requirements for pollen feeding. Dance ies
are also important pollinators (especially in some habi-
tats like the high arctic), and are known for unusu al
variation in sexual behaviour, including both classical
sex-roles and sex-role reversed species. These dier-
ences in mating systems have strong implications for
the timing and duration of adult activity.
The PhD project will have three main parts, each ded-
icated to an important aim:
Part 1: The candidate will use long-term historical data
(from museums, recording schemes, and the Rotham-
sted Insect Survey) to assess covariance between life
history traits and phenology across species of hover-
ies and dance ies. The candidate will learn to apply
advanced statistical models (using likelihood-based pa-
rameter exploration and model selection) to summarize
phenologies, and ask whether and how life history traits
aect parameters in these best-t equations.
Part 2: We will measure the consequences of variation
in life history and phenology for pollination eciency
and seed set using eld work on experimental arrays
of radishes (Brassicaceae: Raphanus sativus). Flies are
frequent and important pollinators, and radishes are
self-incompatible (obligate outcrossers), often showing
highly variable seed set. In consecutive eld seasons, we
will experimentally manipulate radish phenology and
regress seed set on observations of pollinator phenology
and abundance.
Part 3: Using parameters describing the phenology of
y species, including transitions in phenology over time
(from part 1), we will simulate changes in the tempo-
ral structure of community composition under dierent
climate change scenarios. We will also assess the conse-
quences of such change for the tness of populations
having varying oral phenologies and sensitivities to
pollinator identity (based on observations of seed set
in part 2).January 1, 2014 EvolDir 49

First PhD studentship: Evolutionary breakdown of
reproductive barriers in introduced monkeyowers
through genome duplication.
University of Stirling, Biological and Environmental
Sciences, in partnership with Durham University Ap-
plication deadline: 13th January 2014
Overview: Hybridisation and whole-genome duplica-
tion are key processes in the evolutionary history of
plants, and may have important repercussions for the
development of new invasive plant threats. The intro-duction of species into new regions due to human trade
and travel has greatly increased the potential of previ-
ously isolated species to hybridise. Despite the impor-
tance of hybridisation and polyploidisation in the evo-
lutionary history of land plants, and their association
with the development of invasiveness, the mechanisms
that allow hybrids to overcome reproductive barriers
remain obscure. The principal aim of this studentship
is to use introduced species of monkeyowers (Mimu-
lus spp.) with dierent ploidy levels, to investigate the
causes and consequences of inter-specic hybridisation
and whole-genome duplication.
Several species of Mimulus with native ranges in the
Americas were introduced into the United Kingdom in
the early 1800's, and quickly became naturalized and
widespread. Hybridization in this group has produced
a complex array of widely distributed hybrids in the
UK, with varying levels of pollen sterility. We have
recently documented that genome duplication in nat-
ural hybrids is associated with a dramatic increase in
fertility causing the rise of a new allopolyploid species,
Mimulus peregrinus, in the last 140 years. However,
preliminary studies of synthetically produced Mimulus
polyploids indicate that genome duplication does not
necessarily result in full restoration of fertility, suggest-
ing that other genetic mechanisms may regulate fertil-
ity.
Methodology: In this project, we will use natural and
synthetically produced Mimulus hybrids to address the
following specic research questions: (1) What are the
intrinsic barriers for hybrid formation? (2) What is
the contribution of genome duplication to restoring hy-
brid fertility? (3) Are polyploid hybrids of dierent
origins interfertile? (4) What is the genetic basis of
fertility in polyploid hybrids? To answer these ques-
tions the student will combine eld surveys, greenhouse
experiments, and genomic analysis using next genera-
tion sequencing. The student will conduct eld surveys
of natural populations across the UK, and carry out
a crossing program in the greenhouse to compare nat-
ural and synthetic hybrids. Finally, the student will
investigate the genetic basis of pollen fertility in hybrid
Mimulus using bulk-segregant analysis and genotyping
by sequencing using RAD tags. Genomic analyses will
be conducted under the supervision of Dr. Brennan in
Durham as well as our project partners in the UK and
the US.

AvianPopulationGenetics
A PhD project project has become available at the Uni-
versity of Tasmania studying the population genetics of
Providence Petrels and Flesh-footed Shearwaters.
Both species are of conservation concern, with Prov-
idence Petrels presently only nesting on two islands
(Lord Howe and Phillip Island... adjacent to Norfolk
Island), and Flesh-footed shearwater numbers undergo-
ing decline (several colonies throughout New Zealand,
Lord Howe, and southern Australia, and St Paul in the
Indian Ocean). Emphasis is on the Providence Petrel,
which was historically numerous on \mainland" Nor-
folk Island, and there are interests in re-introducing
the species, subsequent to understanding the genetic
relationships among extant and extinct colonies.
The structure of the PhD is presently as follows:
Major components: (i) Comparison of Lord Howe and
Phillip Island Providence Petrels using genetic markers
(microsatellites, mtDNA, and SNPs), morphometrics,
and vocalisation data. (ii) Comparison of Lord Howe,
Phillip Island, and the extinct \mainland" Norfolk Is-
land colony based on mtDNA, using ancient DNA pro-
tocols on paleontological material from Norfolk Island.
(iii) Population genetics analysis of Flesh-footed shear-
water colonies throughout their range.
Minor components: (i) Reporting of marker polymor-
phism screening in Providence Petrels (and possibly
Flesh-footed shearwaters) (ii) Reporting the potential
for sex-biased genetic sampling in synchronously breed-
ing seabirds, and the possible implications for popula-
tion genetic analysesThis study has recently been vacated by another PhD
student for personal reasons, and at present, much
of the data have been collected. Therefore, this will
be a very ecient PhD project and there also exists
strong potential for additional activities within the PhD
such as meta-analyses of population genetics studies in
seabirds.
IMPORTANT POINTS: 1. The last time this project
was advertised there were exactly 50 applicants. Un-
fortunately, I do not have time to respond to this
many people in detail [again], so apologies that my re-
sponse e-mail could be blunt and succinct (\your back-
ground/CV are unsuitable for the project"). 2. This
project and the PhD candidature will be administered
through the University of Tasmania. The successful
applicant will need to apply for and earn a PhD schol-
arship at the University of Tasmania, with the next
round anticipated in early 2014. You will need to have
completed a BSc and some subsequent form of research-
focussed degree (an MSc, or in the Australian/New
Zealand system, an Honours year) to be considered.
3. If you are an Australian or New Zealand citizen or
Australian permanent resident, you would receive both
a scholarship and fee- waiver (you will receive ~$AUS
24k p.a. to live o, and no up- front fees). 4. If you are
not an Australian or New Zealand citizen or Australian
permanent resident, you will be liable for upfront fees,
at a rate of approximately $AUS 20k p.a. Exceptional
applicants may earn a \fee scholarship" from the Uni-
versity, but these are very competitive. Otherwise, I
cannot assist with opportunities to pay these fees in
any way, and you will be unable to work during your
PhD to pay these fees as well.
If you are interested in applying, please send me an
e-mail (chris.burridge@utas.edu.au) containing: (i) ex-
pression of interest, and some general background of
your past experience, qualications, and expertise rel-
evant to this project (population genetics) (ii) a copy
of your CV (iii) copies of all your academic transcripts
(BSc and subsequent degrees). Please note I want to
see your performance in the individual classes, not just
a copy of the nal certicate.

UTurku BalticMarineBiodiversity
PhD position in the project Sea marine biodiversity
V addressing the potential of adaptation to climate
change in the University of Turku
A position for a PhD-student is open in the project
focusing on adaptive potential of Baltic Sea littoral
organisms in face of the ongoing environmental
changes. Position is funded through the BONUS
program by the EU Commissions Research Frame-
work Programme and the Academy of Finland.
For description, see http://www.bonusportal.org/-
bonus projects/viable ecosystem projects 2012/bambi
.The position is located in the Section of Ecology,
Department of Biology, University of Turku, Finland
(http://www3.sci.utu./biologia/en/).
Environmental change not just drives shifts in species
distributions but also generate selection for species
traits relevant to tolerate the new environmental condi-
tions. Potential for adaptive responses is crucially de-
pendent on the availability of genetic variation in these
traits. In the Baltic Sea, the major predicted changes
will be decreasing salinity and increasing temperature.
The project will focus on adaptive potential of model
species, the seaweeds Fucus vesiculosus and F. radicans
and the mesograzer Idotea balthica, to the predicted
changes. The species are becoming model species in
ecological and evolutionary studies owing to their im-
portance in ecological function of littoral communities,
experimental feasibility and progress in gaining genome
sequence data. This enables research approaches span-
ning from genes to phenotypes to tness, and linking
tolerance traits to genetic variation. The doctoral re-
search is expected to focus on the model species and
issues such as estimating tolerance and plasticity to
salinity and temperature, identifying the genetic basis
and/or heritability of tolerance, and estimating eects
of community-wide stress on tolerance and on interac-
tions between species. The approaches will be wide-
ranging and challenging, but collaboration within the
consortium will support the research. The project con-
sortium will provide a multi-disciplinary research envi-
ronment with expertise ranging from ecology, genetics,
ecological genomics and evolutionary biology to spatial
modeling, management and environmental politics.
The PhD-student position will be available for about
four years, from 1st March 2014 (starting time ne-gotiable) to the end of 2017. A successful appli-
cant is expected to have a Masters degree in ecol-
ogy, genetics, evolutionary biology or marine sci-
ences or otherwise qualied to apply admission to
postgraduate studies in the Faculty of Mathemat-
ics and Natural Sciences (for qualications and pro-
cedures, see http://www.utu./en/units/sci/research/-
postgraduate/Pages/home.aspx). An ideal candidate
shows high motivation and enthusiasm for science, cre-
ativity and ability to independent (though supervised)
work. Experience in experimental eld and laboratory
work and skills in statistical analysis will be assets.
Applications for the PhD position will be reviewed
starting on 15th Jan 2014; however, candidates will be
considered until the position is lled. The salary will be
in accordance with the Finnish university norms, about
1950 - 2750 $ a/month, the exact level depending on the
stage of the PhD-studies and competence.
The application documents should include: 1. Moti-
vation letter explaining why you are interested in and
why you are suitable for the position. 2. CV includ-
ing education and prior research experience. 3. List of
relevant publications and a one-page summary of the
MSc thesis 4. Name and contact information for two
academic referees
Send the above to me by email no later than 15th Jan
2014, preferably as a single pdf le. Feel free to contact

2014. Faculty members in the department oer a wide
range of expertise, from molecular biology to ecol-
ogy. Graduate students are eligible for teaching assis-
tantships, which fund the majority of tuition and pro-
vide a stipend of $12,116 per year. WWU is located
in Bellingham, WA, a coastal city north of Seattle at
the base of Mt. Baker in the northwestern part of the
state.
Potential advisors
Marion Brodhagen: Microbiology, molecular biology,54 EvolDir January 1, 2014
and chemical ecology. Our lab studies the plant
pathogenic fungus Aspergillus and aatoxin, a potent
toxin produced by this fungus. Our biggest projects
currently involve the ability of plant secondary metabo-
lites to stop growth and/or toxin production by As-
pergillus. Possible new projects in the laboratory in-
volve bacterial secondary metabolites, and their role in
host-pathogen interactions and in microbial community
ecology.
Eric DeChaine: Arctic and alpine plant systematics and
phylogeography. I am hoping to accept one student be-
ginning Fall 2014. The work in my lab is currently
focused on unraveling the biogeographic and evolution-
ary history of arctic-alpine plants of the north Pacic
Rim through eld, lab, and computer based geographic
and genomic analyses.
Dave Hooper: Plant Community and Ecosystem Ecol-
ogy. I will be accepting one graduate student in fall
2014. My local research is currently focused on assess-
ing ecosystem services associated with dierent scenar-
ios of riparian restoration in Whatcom County. Stu-
dent work would combine GIS analyses of ecosystem
services and eld work, particularly on nutrient reten-
tion, to validate modeling results. I also have oppor-
tunities focused on analyzing large data sets to under-
stand aspects of biodiversity loss and assembly of plant
communities.
Robin Kodner: Marine Microbial Metagenomics. The
Kodner lab does interdisciplinary work integrating ma-
rine microbial ecology with comparative genomics and
bioinformatics for metagenomes. I am recruiting for
one student for work on bioinformatics projects. Some
experience with sequence analysis and programming re-
quired.
Ben Miner: Students in my laboratory focus on how
marine organisms alter their morphology and behavior
in response to dierent environmental conditions, typ-
ically biotic conditions. Current projects in my lab in-
clude research on wasting disease in sea stars, predator-
induced hatching plasticity in marine animals, context-
dependent inducible oenses and defenses in marine or-
ganisms.
Craig Moyer: My interests are marine microbiology and
geomicrobiology focusing on molecular approaches for
exploring microbial diversity, community structure and
ecological interactions. Presently, my lab and I arefocused on the study of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobac-
teria acting as the ecosystem engineers in microbial
mats found at strong redox boundaries, including seep,
spring and vent habitats. We are also examining the
evolutionary divergence of surface and deep subsurface
Zetaproteobacteria in hydrothermal systems.
Merrill Peterson: Ecology and Evolution of Insects.
The primary focus of our lab is on insect diversica-
tion and diversity, ranging from experimental studies
on insect speciation to comparative analyses of the ef-
fects of land use on insect community structure. The
Peterson lab is currently seeking a student interested
in analyzing the mechanistic basis of conspecic sperm
precedence in hybridizing Chrysochus beetles. Such a
study would combine controlled crosses with molecular
and microscopic assays of sperm viability and fertiliza-
tion success. Additional opportunities for students who
wish to examine factors inuencing the richness of in-
sect communities in rapidly-declining natural habitats
in the region (e.g., lowland prairies, coastal dunes) may
also be available.
Lynn Pillitteri: Plant Molecular and Developmental Bi-
ology. A potential graduate project in my lab would
be aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms
driving cell type dierentiation in the model organism,
Arabidopsis thaliana.
Dietmar Schwarz: Ecological and Evolutionary Genet-
ics and Genomics, Evolutionary Ecology. Schwarz's lab
oers opportunities to study speciation and hybridiza-
tion in host specic insects (apple maggot ies and
relatives). Students would also have the opportunity
to collaborate with Alejandro Acevedo-Gutierrez on a
molecular study of diet specialization in seals.
Anu Singh-Cundy: Plant Physiology. We study plant
reproduction at the physiological, cellular, and molecu-
lar levels. Current projects are focused on understand-
ing the role of HD-AGPs, which are proteins that pro-
mote pollen tube growth, in members of the Solanaceae
and also in Arabidopsis.

Expenses paid eld assistant positions to study life-
history evolution in Siberian Jays in Swedish Lapland
For the upcoming eld season (3 March - 8 June 2014)
we are looking for 2 highly motivated expenses paid
eld volunteer to join our eld project (main responsi-
ble Michael Griesser, University of Zurich, Switzerland)
investigating life-history evolution in Siberian jays. The
study site is located near Arvidsjaur, Swedish Lapland.
Our current project investigates the inuence of habitat
quality on ospring quality. The work of the eld volun-
teers will be to help in eld experiments, behavioural
observations, following radio-tagged birds, measuring
nestlings, and data management. This work will give
insight into exciting experimental eldwork. We will
work 5-6 days per week in the eld depending on the
workload of the experiments. Observe that tempera-
tures in the beginning of the season can be as low as
-30C. The work is physically strenuous at times in par-
ticular during the snow melting period in April.
From March until beginning of May will be doing most
of the eldwork on X-country skis, and given that only
the edge of the study site is accessible by car, we ski
up to 15km per day. Thus, a previous knowledge of
X-country skiing is helpful.
The team will vary in size depending on the weeks; a
eld technician, a MSc student and the volunteers will
be present during the whole eld season.
Qualications: (1) BSc/MSc in Biology, Ecology or
similar qualication (2) Previous eld experience (3)
Ability to work in small teams and sociable personal-
ity (4) X-country or general skiing skills advisable (5)74 EvolDir January 1, 2014
Knowledge in observing & handling birds is a plus (6)
Driving licence (7) Fluent in English
We will cover for the accommodation, travel expenses
from and to the study site (in total up to 300 Euros)
as well as the living expenses. Applications - includ-
ing a CV, a letter of motivation (1 page) and the name
of two referees - should be send to Michael Griesser

Location EVOLUTION 2016
Re: Location for future joint annual meetings of the
ASN/SSB/SSE (aka the 'Evolution meeting')
As the new Chief Meeting Organizer responsible for
Evolution 2016 and beyond, I am soliciting suggestions
as to potential locations for future meetings, with par-
ticular emphasis on 2016 as time is getting tight. These
need not be major cities, but preferred locations will:
-Be relatively easy to travel to from within N. America
-Have a meeting venue that can handle 2000+ people,
including 12+ good sized seminar rooms and a large
plenary hall, that are in VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY
(i.e. no more running between buildings). This will al-
most certainly be a conference center as opposed to a
university.
-Have a meeting venue that is centrally located such
that attendees have access to a good selection of local
restaurants/pubs/bars
-Have a range of accommodation options including
lower-cost student residences
-Be somewhere interesting to visit (think night life, cul-
tural activities, natural history)
Portland is a good example of such a location and we
are considering a return visit there in the future (but
not in 2016).
Suggesting a potential location does not, in any way,
commit you to being involved in organizing a meet-
ing should your suggestion ultimately be selected. I
simply want to know about places I otherwise might
not consider. Suggestions should be sent to evolu-
tion.meetings@gmail.com and should include the loca-
tion along with any information you have concerning
the specic venue (i.e. convention center), as well any
details pertinent to the above desired qualities.
The ASN/SSB/SSE appreciate your help.

BaboonEvolution
Dear all,
We are currently recruiting eld assistants for the 2014-
2015 eld season on the Tsaobis Baboon Project. If you
could please circulate the advert below (and attached
yer) to anyone you think might be interested in vol-
untary eldwork in Namibia, that'd be great.
Thanks in advance!
Cheers, Alice and Cass
Alice Baniel and Cassandra Raby PhD students, Insti-
tute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London
Tsaobis Baboon Project - Volunteer Field Assistants
The Tsaobis Baboon Project is a long-term study of
desert baboons in Namibia. Based at the Institute
of Zoology (the research arm of the Zoological Society
of London), and aliated with the Gobabeb Research
and Training Centre (Namibia), our aim is to carry out
fundamental research in behavioural ecology and pop-ulation ecology, and to inform conservation policy and
practice for social species.
We are seeking to appoint six volunteer eldworkers for
the 2014-2015 eld season, between late April 2014 and
late January 2015. A range of 6-month and 3-month
volunteer positions are available over this period. The
eldwork will primarily involve daily follows of baboon
troops on foot, collecting behavioural data from indi-
vidually recognisable animals and their associated eco-
logical conditions. Research over this eld season will
focus on three themes:
* Sexual coercion and conicts over reproduction * So-
cial networks and information transfer * Climate, be-
haviour, and host-parasite dynamics
Successful applicants will specialise in one of these three
research areas, as well as contributing to the wider long-
term study. Further information about the Tsaobis Ba-
boon Project, the volunteer eldworker positions, and
the application procedure can be found on the Project's
webpages:

Daniel Ksepka (NESCENT) Including Fossil Taxa in
Phylogenies: Advances and Issues December 3, 2013
10:00 AM PT
The fossil record oers a rich source of macroevolu-
tionary data. Fossils can reveal transitional forms that
could not be predicted from extant taxa alone, reveal
unexpected biogeographic patterns, and provide tem-
poral information crucial for inferring rates of evolution
and correlations between evolution and abiotic events.
At the same time, including fossil taxa in phylogenetic
analyses presents many challenges. Currently, there
are a wide variety of methods for including fossil data
in phylogenetic analyses ranging from indirect use of
fossil ages to inform divergence dates to simultaneous
analyses of fossil and extant taxa under various opti-
mality criteria and with varying levels of constraints.
One important consideration remains that fossils typi-
cally provide only morphological data, which can lead
to problems related to missing data and potential vi-
olation of common assumptions for model-based phy-
logeny inference methods designed primarily for molec-
ular sequence data. Morphological character data are
typically harvested from from fossils taxa not at ran-
dom, but with an intentional bias towards parsimony-
informative characters (with apomorphies omitted from
matrices). Combined with issues related to sparse cod-
ings in large combined matrices, care must be taken to
avoid spurious inferences.

Phylogenetic Paleobiology: What do we stand to gain
from integrating fossils and phylogenies in macroevolu-
tionary analyses? December 10, 2013 1:00 PM ET
The aim of macroevolutionary science is to under-
stand the patterns and processes responsible for gen-
erating organismal diversity in space and time. Al-
though macroevolutionary change typically occurs over
geologic timescales and has traditionally been studied
by paleobiologists, comparative biologists have become
increasingly interested in macroevolutionary questions,
utilizing time-calibrated molecular phylogenies of ex-
tant taxa as a framework for testing hypotheses about
rates of evolution. In this seminar, Ill examine how in-
tegrating fossils and phylogenies can increase our powerto test and answer fundamental questions about tempo
and mode in phenotypic evolution. Integrating fossil
taxa into phylogenies of extant taxa is worth the ef-
fort: on a per taxon basis, fossils contribute more in-
formation about macroevolutionary pattern and pro-
cess and increase our ability to distinguish processes
that leave similar signals in extant species datasets. Ill
discuss some recent work, and highlight how fossil in-
formation can be used to inform macroevolutionary in-
ference when a combined phylogeny is lacking. One
theme emerges from all of this work; we stand to gain
a better understanding of macroevolution not when we
approach it as biologists or paleontologists but, as G.G.
Simpson recommended 60 years ago, as practitioners of
both.

Software LAMARC 2 1 9 release
We have just released LAMARC version 2.1.9.
LAMARC is a program which performs likelihood or
Bayesian coalescent analysis of population genetic data
in order to estimate population size, growth rate, sub-
population sizes and immigration rates, recombination
rate, and population divergence times.
Version 2.1.9 is an important bug x release. In ver-
sion 2.1.8 inference of population divergence did not
work correctly and all results involving divergence were82 EvolDir January 1, 2014
invalid. The new version additionally corrects crashes
when converting les and when using monomorphic
DNA loci, but these do not invalidate any previous suc-
cessful runs.
LAMARC 2.1.9 can be freely downloaded from:
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc/-
index.html If you have visited this site before it
is possible you will have to refresh your browser to see
the new version.

Software kSNP MicrobialSNPs
Announcing availability of kSNP v2: a program
for SNP identication in microbial genomes without
genome alignment.
One of the major barriers to SNP analysis of micro-
bial genome sequences is that multiple alignment of
more than about 30 bacterial genomes is not currently
practical. kSNP circumvents the alignment problem by
identifying SNPs from data sets that can include n-
ished genome sequence, assembled genomes, and raw-
read (unassembled) genomes. It is capable of identify-
ing SNPs in sets of hundreds of genomes and runs on
Mac OSX and Linux 64-bit computers in a few minutes
to a few hours depending on the size of the data set.
kSNP and its applications are described in detail in
Gardner SN, Hall BG (2013) When Whole-Genome
Alignments Just Won't Work: kSNP v2 Software for
Alignment-Free SNP Discovery and Phylogenetics
of Hundreds of Microbial Genomes. PLoS ONE
8(12): e81760. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081760
http://www.plosone.org/article/-
info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0081760 .
kSNP v2 is available at https://sourceforge.net/
projects/ksnp as executables for Mac OS X and for
Linux 64-bit operating systems, and as source code; a
complete User Guide is provided.
Abstract
Eective use of rapid and inexpensive whole genome
sequencing for microbes requires fast, memory ecient
bioinformatics tools for sequence comparison. ThekSNP v2 software nds single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in whole genome data. kSNP v2 has
numerous improvements over kSNP v1 including SNP
gene annotation; better scaling for draft genomes avail-
able as assembled contigs or raw, unassembled reads;
a tool to identify the optimal value of k; distribution
of packages of executables for Linux and Mac OS X
for ease of installation and user-friendly use; and a de-
tailed User Guide. SNP discovery is based on k-mer
analysis, and requires no multiple sequence alignment
or the selection of a single reference genome. Most tar-
get sets with hundreds of genomes complete in minutes
to hours. SNP phylogenies are built by maximum like-
lihood, parsimony, and distance, based on all SNPs,
only core SNPs, or SNPs present in some intermedi-
ate user-specied fraction of targets. The SNP-based
trees that result are consistent with known taxonomy.
kSNP v2 can handle many gigabases of sequence in a
single run, and if one or more annotated genomes are
included in the target set, SNPs are annotated with pro-
tein coding and other information (UTRs, etc.) from
Genbank le(s). We demonstrate application of kSNP
v2 on sets of viral and bacterial genomes, and discuss
in detail analysis of a set of 68 nished E. coli and
Shigella genomes and a set of the same genomes to
which have been added 47 assemblies and four \raw
read" genomes of H104:H4 strains from the recent Eu-
ropean E. coli outbreak that resulted in both bloody
diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and
caused at least 50 deaths.

PathogenInteractions
Two postdoctoral positions are available in the
Cobey Lab at the University of Chicago (http://-
cobeylab.uchicago.edu/). Research in the Cobey Lab
focuses on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of
host-pathogen interactions. Both positions are compu-
tational and involve signicant applied and theoretical
components.The aim of the rst position is to investigate the evo-
lution of antibody repertoires. This work involves eval-
uating the ruggedness of antibody tness landscapes
and competition between immune cells to understand
the factors shaping pathogen evolution within hosts and
host populations. Ideal applicants will have background
in computational biology, population dynamics, popu-
lation genetics, or molecular evolution and an interest
in immunology.
The aim of the second position is to evaluate models to
predict and explain pathogen interactions using time-
series and longitudinal data. This position is ideal for
applicants with strong skills in statistical inference, epi-
demiology, or theoretical ecology. This work involves86 EvolDir January 1, 2014
collaboration with colleagues at Argonne National Lab-
oratory.
Both positions are for one year, with the possibility to
extend the length of the appointment. Postdoctoral
fellows are expected to be highly motivated, creative,
collaborative, and technically skilled (e.g., in computa-
tion, statistics, or nonlinear dynamics) and to be great
communicators. Assuming good progress on their ini-
tial aims, fellows will be encouraged to develop their
own research directions under the broad interests of the
lab.
Applications should be sent to Sarah Cobey
(cobey@uchicago.edu) and include as a single le
a cover letter, CV, contact information for three
references, and a few representative publications.

PlantMetapopulationDynamics
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN PLANT
METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS : INTRODUCING
SEED DORMANCY IN COLONIZATION/ EX-
TINCTION MODELS AT CENTRE D 'ECOLOGIE
FONCTIONNELLE ET EVOLUTIVE (CNRS, UMR
5175, FRANCE).
We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow
to investigate plant metapopulation dynamics, using a
combination of methodological development and data
analysis. The post-doctoral position is funded for one
year by R egion Languedoc Roussillon and is part of a
'Chercheur d 'Avenir ' project (2012-15).
CONTEXT: Metapopulation dynamics hypothesize
that the spatial distribution of species at the regional
scale results from extinction/colonization dynamics of
local populations. Spatially realistic models have been
developed in animals (Hanski and Gaggioti, 2004)
which allow characterizing colonization kernels and ex-
tinction parameters from temporal presence/absence
data in a set of suitable patches. Plant dynamics has
largely been left apart from the metapopulation dynam-
ics framework and the applicability of metapopulation
framework to plants has been questioned in the litera-
ture (Freckleton and Watkinson, 2002). One of the rea-
sons is the existence of seed dormancy with persistent
seed bank in the soil that allows a population to recover
without dispersal events even after a long period of ab-
sence of reproductive plants. The postdoctoral project
is part of a 4-year research project on plant metapopu-
lations which aims at (1) developing models for the joint
estimation of dispersal, dormancy and extinction from
presence/absence data (2) analyzing eld data from
plant metapopulations. Using hidden Markov models
(Mackenzie et al, 2009), we have recently shown that (i)
dormancy (as well as dispersal and extinction) can be
inferred from simulated time series of presence-absence
data , (ii) hidden Markov models oer a reliable way
to estimate colonization and extinction rates for plant
metapopulations with a seed bank (Fr eville et al, 2013).
POST-DOCTORAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The
rst aim of the postdoctoral project is to improve the
model of Fr eville et al (2013) by introducing, (1) lim-
ited dispersal (dispersal kernel), (2) habitat hetero-
geneity, for various metapopulation scenarios (Levins' model, island/mainland models, rescue eect, see
Gotelli, 1991). The second aim of the postdoctoral
project is to analyze available plant metapopulation
data that have already been collected in annual plant
communities in urban alignments of patches around
trees in Montpellier and Paris (Pr. Machon group,
MNHN Paris). Metapopulation parameters ' estimates
will for instance allow testing evolutionary ecology
hypotheses such as the dispersal dormancy trade-o.
For more information, please contact Dr Pierre-Olivier
Cheptou by email (pierre-olivier.cheptou@cefe.cnrs.fr).
RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT: The postdoctoral fel-
low will jointly work with evolutionary ecologists (P.-
O Cheptou and H. Fr eville) and biostatisticians (R.
Pradel and R. Choquet) at the CEFE-CNRS (UMR
5175) in Montpellier (France) in the Biodiversity
and Conservation department. The CEFE (http://-
www.cefe.cnrs.fr/) is a large french research center in
Ecology with ~140 sta members. It develops research
in a wide range of disciplines, including evolutionary bi-
ology, population dynamics, quantitative genetics and
conservation biology.
QUALIFICATIONS: A PhD degree in Ecol-
ogy/Evolutionary Ecology is required. The applicant
should be well acquainted with biostatistics and theo-
ries in evolutionary ecology. Documented experience in
programming (R, Winbugs, Matlab, etc) and in basic
mathematical tools is required. The ideal candidate
will be able to work both independently and as part of
a team.
STARTING DATE: 1st of March 2014 ; the preferred
start date is slightly exible and will depend on the
timeframe of the most qualied applicant.
GROSS SALARY: 2300 euros minimum (depending on
experience)
APPLICATION: The application deadline is February
15th 2014 and interviews will take place shortly after-
wards. Candidates interested in the position should
send (1) a cover letter summarizing their research in-
terests and expertise relevant to the project, (2) a Cur-
riculum Vitae, (3) a listing of publications, and (4) the
names and contact information for at least two refer-
ees who can provide recommendations. The applica-
tion should be sent as a single pdf le to P.-O Cheptou
(pierre-olivier.cheptou@cefe.cnrs.fr).

ForestGenetics
Title: What are the processes that maintain adap-
tive genetic diversity within populations in forest tree
species at small spatial and temporal ecological scales?
Rationale and scientic content: Diversifying selection
structures the adaptive genetic diversity of forest trees.
Range-wide geographic clines for important tness-
related traits such as phenology or insect / drought
resistance are well-known in forest trees. Landscape-
scale clines also exist for the same traits and at this
scale, Qst values are typically higher than Fst values,
indicating the potential role of selection on population
dierentiation at multiple scales (Le Corre and Kr emer
2012). Despite this strong dierentiation (explaining
up to 30% of total adaptive genetic variance in phenol-
ogy for example), standing genetic variation and phe-
notypic trait diversity remain large within populations
for these traits and the genes involved in these adap-
tive traits generally show a weak population structure
(Meril a et al 2001; Rockman 2012). Trait-marker or
environment-marker association studies investigate the
polymorphism associated to established dierentiation
among populations or among environments. At the
within-population level, individual components of t-
ness (survival and reproductive success) can also be
estimated, informing on locally on-going selection pro-
cesses.
The goal of this post-doctoral project is to investi-
gate how genotypes, phenotypes, environments and t-
ness are linked at among- and within-population levels
and how selection proceeds when populations adapt to
sharp ecological changes. In particular, it will address
the issue of which main drivers are responsible for the
maintenance of adaptive genetic diversity within tree
populations. The post-doc is part of the French ANR
project FLAG: Forest tree ecological genetics: interplay
of gene ow and environmental variability in shaping lo-January 1, 2014 EvolDir 91
cal adaptation and genetic adaptive potential ((http:/-
/www.ecofog.gf/spip.php?article635).
As a rst part of the project, simulation studies will
be used to characterize the eect of (1) local demo-
graphic changes (drift or niche lling lag due to re-
cent recolonization dynamics), (2) intensive gene ow
between divergent populations and (3) diversifying se-
lection within population due to heterogeneous en-
vironmental ltering conditions, on standing genetic
variation within and among- populations. Using an
individual-based demographic model for trees and sim-
ple genetic architecture model (L-shaped additive ef-
fects of the QTLs) with dierent gene ow and selection
patterns in the landscape, the thresholds beyond which
dierentiation appears notwithstanding high within-
population diversity will be identied. Particular at-
tention will be devoted to how QTL-alleles and their
disequilibrium become distributed among populations
and whether the QTLs involved in population dier-
entiation remain polymorphic within populations. The
study will then be extended to markers located in the
neighborhood of the QTLs, and to sampling design of
markers/QTLs mimicking the candidate gene approach
commonly used in tree species (with typically few genes
containing many non-independent markers).
In a second step, experimental data issued from the
FLAG project will be used to identify the most likely
adaptation scenarios in various case studies. Pheno-
typic and genotypic data from replicated short scale
ecological gradients will be analyzed using common sta-
tistical frameworks. Data sets contain adult and juve-
nile phenotypes and genotypes measured in situ used
to assess the reproductive success of the adults, as well
as progenies (juvenile stage) phenotypes and genotypes
measured in common gardens from which parental ge-
netic values can be estimated for the traits of inter-
est. Model species for which data are available include
Temperate, Mediterranean and Tropical conifers and
broadleaves. The phenotypic traits available are related
to survival, growth, seed output, water eciency un-
der drought conditions and vegetative bud phenology.
Genotypes available are both neutral (microsatellites)
and potentially adaptive (SNPs at candidate genes).
Understanding which processes primarily act on stand-
ing genetic variation of key adaptive traits will make it
possible for forest managers to adapt their strategies.
Depending on the background of the selected candi-
date and his/her preferences, either step one, step two
or both could be emphasized during the duration of the
post-doc.

PopulationGeneticsMixedPloidy
***Postdoctoral fellowship 12 months*** ***Method-
ology of analysis of the evolutionary history of species
with various ploidy levels***
A 12 month postdoctoral fellowship is opened as part
of the FloRHiGe project (2013-2015), granted by the
French region 'Pays de la Loire'. The postdoc will
work at the Research Institute of Horticulture and
Seeds, in the team 'Genetics and Diversity in Ornamen-
tal plants' (GDO, http://www6.angers-nantes.inra.fr/-
irhseng/Research/GDO) and will be located at INRA
of Angers, in the West of France.
*Scientic rationale* Reliable methods, especially ap-
proximate Bayesian computation (ABC), have been de-
veloped to estimate demographic parameters of species
evolutionary history and to compare several models,
sometimes complex (Csill ery et al. 2010 ; Bertorelle et
al. 2010 ; Clotault et al. 2012). These conceptual de-
velopments and corresponding computer programs were
created initially for diploid species. However polyploidy
aects numerous species, especially in Flowering plants.
Besides larger eective population size in polyploids,
coalescence analyses may be complicated by the occur-
rence of various allele segregation types: polysomic, dis-
omic, mixed or clade-specic segregation types, like the
unbalanced meiosis in the Caninae section of the Rosa
genus (Ritz and Wissemann 2011). Studies about the
development of inferential methods of the evolutionary
history of polyploid populations considering these pa-
rameters are very rare and only partially address this
topic (Jakobsson et al. 2006 ; Arnold et al. 2012 ;
St-Onge et al. 2012).
*Topical rationale bound to the project* The FloRHiGe
project aims at identifying the success factors of the
varietal innovation of the rosebush in the XVIIIth and92 EvolDir January 1, 2014
XIXth centuries in France by a genetics and history in-
terdisciplinary approach. The genetic resources of the
rosebushes of this period include numerous hybrids of
various ploidy levels (2 to 6), preserved and prop-
agated by vegetative way in rose gardens. One of the
objectives of the project FloRHiGe is to characterize
the structure of the genetic diversity of 1500 of these
rosebushes and to infer the evolutionary history of the
corresponding populations. This study will be realized
by means of neutral microsatellite markers, currently
gone into production. The molecular evolution of about
fty genes distributed on the genome, including candi-
date genes, will then be studied on a sub-sample of
rosebushes to look for signatures of selection.
*Task of the postdoctoral fellow* The recruited re-
searcher will be in charge of developing a method of
analysis of the evolutionary history of populations with
mixed ploidy levels, taking into account various modes
of genetic segregation found in polyploids and a peren-
nial life history associated with a sexual and asexual
mode of reproduction. Cognitively, this work will be
the opportunity to test the impact of these various pa-
rameters on the evolutionary history. Practically, the
work will have to result in a method allowing to analyze
the evolutionary history of the sample of the project
FloRHiGe. This work should lead to the redaction of
two publications as rst author and as collaborator.
*Required skills* Excellent skills in population genetics
and statistics are required to achieve this project. A
prior experience on the ABC methods as well as pro-
gramming language skills would be very appreciated. A
rst experience on the genetics of polyploids would be
helpful.

OliveTreePopulationGenomics
Postdoctoral position in population genomics of theMediterranean olive tree (INRA Montpellier, UMR
AGAP, France)
The AFEF team (INRA & Montpellier SupAgro) opens
a post-doctoral position in the eld of population ge-
nomics on the Mediterranean olive tree. This 18-
month post-doctoral project will be developed within
the OliveMed project \Linking genes under domestica-
tion to phenotype traits in the Mediterranean olive tree:
towards sustainable management by building a network
of phenotyping platforms for association mapping stud-
ies", supported by Agropolis Fondation, Montpellier.
Scientic project: Detection of genes under domesti-
cation is currently carried out in the hosting unit, us-
ing a comparative genomics approach and analyzing the
RNAseq of wild and domesticated olives within the AR-
CAD project SP1 [1]. However, our recent results show
that olive tree domestication was strongly impacted by
diusion from eastern to western Mediterranean areas
[2]. Our ndings indicate that evolutionary factors such
as migration and admixture are important to under-
stand olive diversication in the central and western
Mediterranean areas. In a rst step, in order to over-
come the hidden eects of migration and admixture, we
aim to detect genes under domestication using a sim-
ple model combining demographic and selection eects
by analyzing wild and cultivated olive trees from the
primary center of domestication. In a second step, we
aim to extend this domestication gene detection by an-
alyzing a representative sample of Mediterranean olive
genetic diversity, taking migration and admixture ef-
fects into account.
The post-doctoral work will specically focus on: i)
the construction and validation of an inference model
on the evolutionary history of the olive tree (MCMC
and ABC approaches), ii) the detection of SNPs un-
der selection using a suitable inference model and ge-
nomic analysis of RNA sequences (annotation, gene
arrays), iii) the construction of a SNP chip based on
SNPs under selection, including those that will be
mapped on the F1 hybrid population under study in
the hosting team. [1] http://www.arcad-project.org/-

TheoreticalPopulationGenetics
PartialAsexuality
Postdoctoral position in theoretical population genet-
ics and evolution of partially asexual species, available
for 16 months starting in winter/spring 2014, Rennes,
France.
# Context: Many species reproduce using both sexual
and asexual events. Yet, population genetics concepts
and models underlying the interpretation of molecular
data are based on the assumption of either pure sexual
or pure asexual reproduction. We use full and approx-
imated Markov chains, diusion processes, stochastic
dierential equations and optimized individual-based
simulations (for complex life cycles) to propose infer-
ential methods (bayesian and learning machine), new
parameters and frameworks to analyze and understand
how partial asexuality dynamically shapes and struc-
tures the genomic diversity in such species. The candi-
date will join a transversal research team (Mathemat-
ics, Computing and Evolution) aiming at developing
theoretical population genetics models to understand
how such reproductive modes inuence the genetic di-
versity of metapopulations, and to revise expectations
of population composition under partial asexuality.
The candidate will work in the framework of a French
national research project (ANR Clonix) aiming at pro-
viding new tools to understand the ecology and evo-
lution of partially clonal organisms that oer oppor-
tunities to co-author collaborative applied and theo-
retical papers. The candidate will be in charge of
formalizing advances obtained through models devel-
opment and simulations, and synthetize their conse-
quences to propose new \null models" describing the
expected genetic composition of partly asexual pop-
ulations. The work will be performed in collabora-
tion with Sophie Arnaud-Haond (Ifremer S ete http://-
annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/17007/en/ ). Strong capacity of
team interaction is required in order to timely share the
advances obtained through modelling and simulations,
and propose adapted theoretical approaches altogether
to the involved partners.
# Competences: The candidate should have at least
a strong backgrounds either in theoretical population
genetics, or/and computing (Unix Batch scripts, C and
Python) or/and mathematics (linear algebra, Markov
chains, stochastic dierential equations). Team work
and multiple hand programming skills are required.94 EvolDir January 1, 2014
# Conditions: The position is funded for 16 or 17
months, following the classical French government con-
tract of employment and salary (from 1750EUR to
1880EUR net salary depending on experience, plus ex-
tra salary benets including medical insurance, chil-
dren cares, public transport and lunch contributions).
Though near the sea and situated in a very touristic
region, life in French Britany is relatively cheap con-
sidering European standard. Rennes is a student city
(~60.000 university students over 300.000 inhabitants)
with a lot of facilities for newcomers.
# Application: Candidates should submit an applica-
tion in English consisting of a CV with full list of publi-

MaxPlanck Tuebingen HIV
Evolution
Post-doc positions at Max-Planck Tuebingen: HIVJanuary 1, 2014 EvolDir 99
Evolution/Theoretical Population Genetics
Post-doctoral positions are available in the Max-
Planck-Research group of Richard Neher in Tuebingen,
Germany. Our group works on HIV evolution and the-
oretical population genetics. HIV evolves very rapidly
and the evolutionary dynamics can be studied in longi-
tudinal samples. In addition, the abundance of cross-
sectional data allows as to investigate the patterns of
molecular evolution on time scales ranging from month
to millions of years.
Our group combines empirical research, a collabora-
tion with Prof. Jan Albert at the Karolinska Institute
in Stockholm, Sweden, who is using deep sequencing
methods to obtain detailed snapshots of HIV popula-
tions at densely spaced time points, with theory. Dy-
namical data is a much richer source of evolutionary
information that static snapshots and we will use this
data to parameterize models of HIV evolution. In ad-
dition to sequence information, our modeling of HIV
evolution builds on structural information at the level
of RNA genome and the viral proteins as well as the in-
teraction of the viral population with the host immune
system. One focus of the lab is the evolution of reg-
ulatory features and RNA secondary structures. Our
empirical work on HIV is complemented by theoretical
work on the dynamics of rapidly evolving population.
* evolution of RNA structures and non-protein aspects
of the HIV genome * drug resistance evolution in HIV
* drug resistance evolution in bacteria * development
of methods to predict evolution
The projects are funded by Max-Planck-Society, an
ERC Starting Grant on HIV evolution, and a collabo-
rative grant on translation eciency in viruses together
with Tamir Tuller at Tel-Aviv university.
We are looking for highly motivated applicants with
a strong background in mathematics, as well as pro-
ciency in at least one programming and one script-
ing language (python, preferably). A PhD in a rel-
evant discipline (physics, math, biology, or computer
science/bioinformatics, etc) is required. Prior exposure
to population genetics and bioinformatics is desirable,
but absolutely not necessary.
The institute is located on the Max Planck Campus
in Tuebingen and oers an international environment,
with English as the working language. We are part
of a dynamic and interactive group of labs researching
various aspects of evolution. Tuebingen boasts one of
Germany's top universities and a vibrant cultural life
with easy connections to major European cities.
Applicants should send an application (statement of re-
search interest, CV, publication list, contact details ofthree references, merged into a single PDF) directly to
richard.neher@tuebingen.mpg.de
Salary will be according to the public service employee
pay scale (TVOED 13). For informal inquiries about

A 24 month postdoc position is available in the elds of
Eco-Physiology and Behavioral Ecology in the Striped
Mouse Research Group www.stripedmouse.com of
Neville Pillay http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/-
science/apes/sta/academicsta/pillay/7019/ and
Carsten Schradin http://www.iphc.cnrs.fr/-Carsten-

the University of the Witwatersrand, collect data in
the eld at the Succulent Karoo Research Station,
and do lab work at the Institut Pluridisciplinaire
Hubert Curien, D epartement d'Ecologie Physiologie et
Ethologie (DEPE), France's largest eco-physiology lab
with one the world's best isotope laboratories lead by
Stephane Blanc http://www.iphc.cnrs.fr/-Stephane-
Blanc-.html .
Research topic. Biologists study how species survive
and reproduce in a changing world. The postdocJanuary 1, 2014 EvolDir 103
will study behavioral and physiological adaptation to
droughts, one consequence of global warming, asking
whether and how individuals can decrease their energy
expenditure during periods with low food availability.
Energy availability restricts survival and reproduction
and often changes seasonally, such that animals have
to adjust their energy expenditure. Measuring changes
in resting metabolic rate (RMR) can help us to un-
derstand the extent to which animals can reduce their
basal metabolism during periods of food shortage. Be-
havioral changes, especially reduced activity, might re-
duce energy expenditure to a larger extent than a reduc-
tion in RMR can, and both processes might co-occur.
Thus, to answer the question how animals can cope
with reduced energy availability it is crucial to under-
stand whether they can reduce daily energy expenditure
(DEE) and to measure changes in both behavior and in
RMR to understand the underlying mechanisms.
The postdoc will study striped mice (Rhabdomys
pumilio) in South Africa during their annual dry sea-
son. The eld site is well established, and the popu-
lation has been permanently monitored by a team at
the research station for over a decade. All eld tech-
niques have been used successfully previously but not
in combination. The postdoc will measure RMR using
respirometry, and he / she will do behavioral observa-
tions to determine activity budgets. Blood samples will
be collected and analyzed in Strasbourg to determine
DEE, water turnover, and body composition using the
doubly-labeled water method.
Objectives
1. Compare RMR between moist and dry seasons.
2. Compare activity budgets between moist and dry
season.
3. Compare DEE between moist and dry season.
4. By comparing results obtained from 3. with 1. and
2. we will be able to estimate the level of energy savings
due to reduction in RMR and reduction in activity.
5. We can also calculate the water turnover and thus
water savings due to reduced energy expenditure, which
will be crucial to survive drought periods characterized
by water limitation.
6. We will determine body composition (fat content)
during dierent seasons.
Salary: This position is funded by the University of the
Witwatersrand with a very competitive salary of R154
000/ year, which allows for a comfortable standard of
living in South Africa. In addition, medical aid is paid
by the University as well as relocation costs of R10 000.
Starting date: Preferably beginning of 2014, latest inMay 2014.
Prole and requirements for the candidate:
You can produce outstanding academic results!
Strong background in eco-physiology and/or behav-
ioral ecology.
Very good writing skills proven by a good publication

Research Project Development of a quantitative analy-

Available position A full time 6-month postdoc posi-
tion is oered jointly by : the laboratory of Analytical
Chemistry at University of Li ege Gembloux Agro-Bio-
Tech (http://www.gembloux.ulg.ac.be/) ,Prof. G. Log-
nay, and the laboratory of Evolutionary Ecology and
Genetics at University of Louvain-la-Neuve (Prof. C.
Nieberding) in Belgium (http://www.uclouvain.be/en-
bdiv.html).
Starting date As early as possible, but not later than
February 2014. The position may be extended for a
longer period of time based on an additional grant ap-
plication requested by the applicant with the support
of the supervisors.
Description of the project The study of the evo-
lution of olfactory communication has gained wider
interest in recent years, since the 2004 Nobel
Prize in Physiology and Medicine obtained by
Drs. Axel and Buck who identied the mecha-
nistic and molecular bases of smell in living or-
ganisms (see http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel prizes/-
medicine/laureates/2004/press.html). Since the dis-
covery of the rst sex pheromone in the silk moth Bom-
byx mori in 1959 [1], Lepidoptera (moths and butter-
ies) have become model species for understanding the
role of chemical communication in the interactions be-
tween individuals of the same, or of dierent species.January 1, 2014 EvolDir 109
We are interested in identifying the importance of nat-
ural and sexual selection on the evolution of the sex
pheromone, a blend of chemicals usually produced by
males to attract the female and to access matings. In-
dividuals often show large variation in traits important
to mating success, such as sex pheromone production.
Variation in male sex pheromone production may be
due to the genetic variability of individuals, to the vari-
ability of the environment(s) in which they live (such
as food access), and to interactions between these two
factors. The impact of genes and environments on ol-
factory sexual traits has only recently drawn the at-
tention of researchers. The species under focus is an
African tropical buttery Bicyclus anynana, a model
lab-reared system for the study of sexual selection and
olfactory communication [e.g. 2-3]. We have identied
the chemical composition of the male sex pheromone [4]
as well as some aspects of sexual selection driving the
evolution of this pheromone [5-6]. This species can be
reared in large numbers in the laboratory all year long.
Tasks and expertise for the postdoc researcher Both
chemistry and biology teams are seeking for a Post-Doc
position in chemical ecology. The major research activ-
ity will be the development and validation of volatile
pheromones sampling and GC-FID analysis. Experi-
ences in hyphenated techniques like GC-MS as well as
chemical ecology will be appreciated. In this context,
the project aims at developing the adequate tool for
quantifying the production of male sex pheromone in
alive individuals, in order to link the genetic and en-
vironmental variation in this sex pheromone and the
mating success of B.anynana males producing it. Pre-
liminary trials are already available in Prof. G. Log-
nay's laboratory, and the project will be integrated with
ecologically-orientated studies performed by the candi-
date within the team of biologists in Prof. C. Nieberd-
ing's laboratory. Altogether, this will allow us to assess
the role of genes and of the environment on the vari-
ation observed in sexual traits and tests whether such
variation has an adaptive value in mate choice.
Work environment The postdoc will work in a
highly active and integrated academic environment of
chemists interested in the eld of chemical ecology
and of evolutionary ecologists in the research team
of Prof. C Nieberding (https://www.uclouvain.be/en-

*Postdoctoral position in evolutionary biology of ageing
{ Uppsala University*
A 2-year postdoctoral position in evolutionary biology
of ageing will soon become available in the Maklakov
lab at the Animal Ecology program in the Evolution-
ary Biology Centre, Uppsala University in as part of
the project funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (ERC) and by the Swedish Research Council (VR).
Position will be open until lled but the review of the
applications will commence on January 15, 2014. The
starting date can be discussed but ideally early in 2014.
*Project *: Classic life-history theory maintains that
increased extrinsic mortality invariably causes evolu-
tion of faster ageing. Our published and ongoing
work using experimental evolution approach suggests
that increased extrinsic mortality can result, some-
what paradoxically, in increased intrinsic longevity.
We are now looking into molecular pathways that
underlie these evolutionary changes, with an em-
phasis on sexual dimorphism in longevity and age-
ing. The postdoctoral fellow is expected to use
next-generation sequencing to conduct gene expres-sion analyses of experimental lines of C. remanei ne-
matode worms that evolved under dierential risk of
death. The project will benet from collaboration with
Prof. Bj orn Schumacher (http://www.schumacher-
lab.cecad.uni-koeln.de/people.htm). There are of
course possibilities of conducting further experimental
work depending on applicant's interests.

*Location *: The Evolutionary Biology Centre (EBC)
in Uppsala University is one of the largest conglom-
erations of evolutionary biologists in Europe, situated
in a largely 'student town' - therefore, it provides a
multitude of opportunities for collaboration as well as
socializing.
*Qualications *: A PhD degree in evolutionary biol-
ogy/genetics/genomics or any relevant and related eld.
The ideal candidates are highly motivated with strong
interest in evolutionary biology and experience in bioin-
formatics. Strong track record is essential. Candidates
should be able to work independently and have good
social and collaborative skills.
*How to Apply *: The application should include an
updated CV, copies of diplomas, a short letter of in-
terest (no longer than 2 pages) and contact details of
at least two references. To conrm with UU rules, the
application must be submitted online via the linkthat

WORKSHOP IN APPLIED PHYLOGENETICS at
Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, California
March 8-15, 2014
Sponsored by the University of California, Davis and
Bodega Marine Laboratory http://treethinkers.org In-
troduction
Phylogenetic methods have revolutionized modern sys-
tematics and become indispensable tools in evolution,
ecology and comparative biology, playing an increas-
ingly important role in analyses of biological data at
levels of organization ranging from molecules to eco-
logical communities. The estimation of phylogenetic
trees is now a formalized statistical problem with gen-
eral agreement on the central issues and questions. A
nearly standard set of topics is now taught as part of
the curriculum at many colleges and universities. On
the other hand, application of phylogenetic methods to
novel problems outside systematics is an area of special
excitement, innovation, and controversy, and perspec-
tives vary widely.
This Spring, for the fteenth consecutive year, we will
teach a workshop for graduate students interested in
applying phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in bi-
ology. The one-week course is an intensive exploration
of problems to which modern phylogenetic approaches
are being applied and the most current statistical tools
and approaches that are used to solve those problems.
We cover a range of topics in ecology, phylogenomics,
functional morphology, macroevolution, speciation, and
character evolution. The course starts with recent ad-
vances in phylogenetic methodology, and then focuses
on methods and tools that can be brought to bear on
these \applied" issues in the context of a given phy-logeny.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Labora-
tory on the Northern California coast, which has on-site
housing. Our newly increased bandwidth and access
to computing clusters allows us to utilize computer-
intensive approaches even in a one-week course. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, dis-
cussion, and hands-on software training. One afternoon
during the week will be left free for eld trips to local
natural areas.
Topics Covered
* Estimating, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees
* Recent advances in Bayesian and Maximum-
likelihood estimation of phylogeny
* Estimation of species trees, gene-tree/species-tree
conicts
* Divergence-time estimation from sequence data: re-
laxed clocks, fossil calibration
* Analysis of character evolution: maximum likelihood
and Bayesian approaches, ancestral-state estimation,
rates of trait evolution
* Analysis of morphological form, function of complex
character systems
* Inference of diversication rates: detecting rate shifts,
testing key innovation hypotheses
* Model specication issues: model selection, adequacy
and uncertainty
* Diagnosing MCMC performance

Integrating biological data, socioeconomic data and
modeling techniques for conservation planning
DATES: 8 - 14 July 2014
LOCATION: Yaound e, CameroonSUMMARY: Central African rainforests represent one
of the most important centers of biological diversity
in the world. While eorts have been made to priori-
tize regions for protection, habitat loss continues at an
alarming rate severely limiting the ability of species to
respond to climate change. The Central African Biodi-
versity Alliance (www.CABAlliance.org) is an interna-
tional partnership that seeks to develop an integrated
framework for conserving central African biodiver-
sity under climate change that is both evolutionarily-
informed and grounded in the socioeconomic con-
straints of the region. This ve-year project is spon-
sored by the U.S. National Science Foundation - Part-
nership for International Research and Education Pro-
gram and involves a broad range of research and educa-
tional activities through partnerships between African,
European and U.S. universities, non-governmental and
governmental organizations.
Professional development workshops are a keystone ed-
ucational project activity, which bring together early-
career scientists and graduate students from Cameroon,
Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Europe and the U.S. The
2014 workshop will provide cutting-edge training in:
{Collection and analysis of genetic data {Collection of
macro- and micro- socioeconomic data {Geographic In-

NESCent EvoDevo Dec11-13
Dear Colleague,
This email is to invite you to contribute your ideas to
upcoming Evo-Devo community workshop supported
by the National Science Foundation of the USA. The
meeting will take place from 11-13 December 2013 at
NESCent in Durham, North Carolina. Although over
300 members of the international Evo-Devo community
have expressed interested in attending the meeting, be-
cause of funding and infrastructure limitations, unfor-
tunately we could ask only a small number of people to
attend the meeting in person.
However, due to the level of interest in this workshop,
we have tried hard to nd ways to get as much com-
munity input as possible, and so would like to invite
you to virtually in the meeting, You can do this in a
number of ways:
1. Set up an account for yourself on the meeting web-
site at http://evodevo.ning.com. On this website, you
will nd an agenda for the program, list of participants
who will be physically present at NESCent, be able to120 EvolDir January 1, 2014
view and participate in wiki-style discussions, and keep
track of what is happening at the meeting. This web-
site will be updated to document the proceedings of the
meeting in real time.
2. Watch some of the presentations and discussions
that will take place during the meeting via Webinar.
You can also contribute to the discussions at NESCent
in real time by sending in your comments and questions
via the Webinar interface V these will be communicated
to the participants at NESCent by a designated mod-
erator. Instructions on how to access the Webinar can
be found on the website indicated in (1) above.
3. Join conference call discussions that will be consid-
ering the same issues as those discussed by participants
at NESCent during parallel breakout groups. The mod-
erators of these calls will summarize the ideas generated
during the call to the group at NESCent. Instructions
on how to call in to these conference calls can be found
on the website indicated in (1) above. The times and
discussion topics for these conference calls are as fol-
lows:

Evolutionary Biology Workshop in the Alps
19-25 June 2014, Arolla, Switzerland
Target participants: PhD students, advanced MasterJanuary 1, 2014 EvolDir 121
students
The main goals of this annual workshop, based on a con-
cept developed by Stephen Stearns and John Maynard
Smith, are to develop the following skills: . develop-
ing your scientic ideas through discussions in groups;
. thinking critically and expressing oneself clearly; .
turning a general idea into a research project; . writing
a research proposal and defending it.
Faculty: Nina Wedell (University of Exeter, UK) Ul-
rich Mueller (University of Texas, Austin, TX) Tanja
Schwander (University of Lausanne, Switzerland) John
Pannell (University of Lausanne, Switzerland) Tadeusz
Kawecki (University of Lausanne, Switzerland)
It is you, the students, who will be in charge in this
course. You will be divided in groups of 4-5 students.
In those groups, you will work on your ideas. You, as a
group, will decide what the important open questions
in broadly dened evolutionary biology are, you will
choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal for a
research project that will address it. The faculty will
visit the groups during the discussions to answer your
questions, provide coaching and give you feedback on
your projects, but they will generally take the back seat.
Additionally, the faculty will give talks about their re-
search and be available for informal discussion with in-
dividual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
The workshop will take place in the 100-year old ho-
tel Kurhaus http://www.hotel-kurhaus.arolla.com/, lo-
cated in a small alpine village at 2000 m of altitude,
which will allow you to focus on work while being able
to enjoy the magnicent landscape and the Alpine ora.

Dear Colleagues,
I apologize for this second email concerning this school,
but several persons contact me to clarify the registra-
tion procedure. Moreover technical reasons obliged us
to move the registration website so please, nd enclosed
in this mail an updated call with I hope clearer expla-
nations.
Best regards

==== Updated DNA metabarcoding spring school call
==DNA metabarcoding is a rapidly evolving method
for assessing biodiversity from environmental DNA. It
has a wide range of applications: biodiversity moni-
toring, animal diet assessment, reconstruction of pa-
leo communities, among others. DNA metabarcoding
relies on molecular techniques such as PCR and next
generation sequencing, and requires bioinformatics and
biostatistics competence to analyze sequencing results.
This approach integrates several scientic areas and re-
quires a broad range of skills, in addition to the classical
ecological knowledge related to the considered research
topic.
The DNA metabarcoding spring school is now in its
third edition and this year it is co-organized by the
metabarcoding.org team and the Research School in
Biosystematics - ForBio in Troms, Norway. Also this
year, the school is divided into two parts.
- The DNA metabarcoding spring school (31 March -
3 April 2014), that will be held during four days at
the Skibotn Field Station, - A two-day workshop at the
Troms University Museum that will follow the course
(4 - 5 April 2014). Participants can register for both the
school and workshop (25 places) or only for the work-
shop (no limit). To register for University of Troms
ECTS (BIO-8001 registration form) or a ForBio course
certicate stating the number of ECTS (no additional
registration needed), participants have to attend both
the school and the workshop. As part of the course
program, each participant is required to (i) give a 12
minute talk about their research during the evening
sessions of the school, and (ii) present a corresponding
poster during the workshop.122 EvolDir January 1, 2014
Registration Registration deadline is 12 January 2014
This year the registration to the third DNA metabar-
coding spring school is a two steps process.
- You need to be a ForBio member or associate. - Any-
one can register as a ForBio associate. To register as
a ForBio associate please visit the ForBio membership
page - To become a ForBio member you must be regis-
tered as a PhD student or hired as a postdoctoral fellow
at a Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, or Finnish university.
- Now that you have a ForBio status (member or asso-
ciate) you have to register to the school and/or the
workshop itself by lling out the registration page.
All participants attending both the school and work-
shop can receive a ForBio course certicate stating
the course description and number of ECTS earned
(2 in this case). If you would like to receive Univer-
sity of Troms ECTS (2) instead of a ForBio course
certicate, please feel out the BIO-8001 registration
form and follow the submission instructions on it. If
you have any questions about University of Troms
registration, please contact Sergei Drovetski (sdrovet-
ski@gmail.com).

ConservationGenetics Mar22-27
UCLA/La Kretz Workshop in Conservation Genomics,
22-27 March, 2014
Conservation biology and genetics have had a long and
intimate relationship, and constitute one of the key ap-
plications of evolutionary analysis to real-world biologi-
cal problems. The impacts of population genetics, phy-
logenetics and phylogeography have been particularly
striking for conservation biology, and have helped solve
some of the most pressing problems in biological con-
servation.
As the eld of landscape-based genetics continues togrow and mature, the increasing availability of genomic-
level data, analytical models and methods stand to
make profound new contributions to our ability to
identify and protect at-risk populations and recover
those that are most endangered. However, genomic
level analyses also carry a heavy burden data sets are
enormous and often require diverse computational ap-
proaches for assembly, quality control and analysis.
This annual workshop provides a comfortable, informal
training environment for a small group of motivated
graduate students to explore how conservation prob-
lems can best be addressed with genomic-level data.
Our goal is to provide hands-on experience on the e-
cient collection, troubleshooting, and analysis of large,
genome-level data sets for conservation-relevant prob-
lems. One of the highlights of our workshop is active
participation from members of several US government
agencies who are at the forefront of endangered species
protection and management, providing a forum for ex-
ploring the most relevant aspects of conservation ge-
nomics to managers.
The UCLA/La Kretz workshop is held at the La Kretz
Field Station and the Stunt Ranch Reserve, both lo-
cated a few miles apart in the heart of the Santa
Monica Mountains. Only 30 miles from UCLA (and
LAX airport), but nestled in the relatively undeveloped
160,000 acre Santa Monica Mountains National Recre-
ation Area, these two venues provide an ideal location
to bring exciting new developments in genomic science
and pressing needs in conservation and management to-
gether in a single workshop.
Our current instructor list, drawn from UCLA, UC
Davis, and UC Berkeley includes:
Mike Alfaro Gideon Bradburd Brant Faircloth Evan
McCartney-Melstad Kirk Lohmueller Mark Phuong
Brad Shaer Victoria Sork Phil Spinks Ian Wang Bob
Wayne
Participants from USGS, USFWS, and the US National
Park Service
Topics covered include:
Traditional conservation genetics Next generation plat-
forms: the best tool for the job Data management
pipelines: Quality Control Data storage Data organi-
zation Data analysis: SNPs Sequences Exploring very
large data sets Functional genomic data Genomic data
and GIS Conservation phylogenomics
Prerequisites Available housing limits course enroll-
ment to ~15 students. Preference is given to doctoral
candidates who are in the early to middle stages of
their thesis research, and who have completed su-January 1, 2014 EvolDir 123
cient prerequisites (through previous coursework or re-
search experience) to have some familiarity with using a
command line interface or programming languages (i.e.
Perl, python etc.). Postdocs and faculty are welcome
to apply, but our rst priority is to graduate student
applicants.
Admission and Fees Students will be admitted based
on academic qualications and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $400. This includes
food and lodging at the La Kretz Field Station, trans-
portation to and from UCLA to the venue, and any
incidental fees for the duration of the course (arriving
March 22, departing March 27).

Third Course on Programming for Evolutionary Biol-
ogy
When: March 21st - April 6th 2014
Location: Leipzig, Germany
Application deadline: January 15th 2014
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evop.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ 'Nothing
in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolu-
tion' (Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolutionary biology
often involves the analysis of an unprecedented amount
of information and supports many other disciplines,
such as medicine (evolutionary medicine), behavioral
biology (evolutionary psychology), ecology, and in-
formation transfer. Scientists have to analyze largedatasets, which requires computational programming
skills to design and apply own ideas into customized
algorithms.
In this intensive 17 days course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on expe-
rience in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the eld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a fo-
cus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
'learning by doing', which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as nal projects in small
groups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs
of evolutionary biology or related research elds with
no or little programming experience who want to be-
come procient in computational evolutionary biology
in a couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the University of Leipzig.

European Science Foundation Workshop in Conserva-
tion Genomics: \Academic exercise or transition with
real-world implications"
Among the tenets of conservation biology is the preser-
vation of genetic diversity. Numerous tools and meth-
ods have been developed in this regard, and the eld
of conservation genetics is actively engaged in using ge-
netic marker data to inform decision makers. For this
workshop, we will explore the transition of the eld to
genome-scale data with an eye on the impact to con-
servation practice.
We will have presentations from 12 of the leading
experts in conservation and genomics (http://-
www.ebc.uu.se/Research/IEG/evbiol/congenomics/-
speakers/).124 EvolDir January 1, 2014
Discussion groups form an integral part of the workshop
such that we have restricted the number of delegates to
a manageable unit ( <50). We ask that all interested
partipants submit a short abstract ( <500 words) de-
tailing their research interests and motivation for at-
tending the workshop. Please include your name, posi-
tion and aliation. Submit via email to Aaron Shafer
(aaron.shafer@ebc.uu.se). Note that the selected stu-
dents will have their workshop fees waived.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
