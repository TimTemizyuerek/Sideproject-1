Hangzhou QuantitativeGenetics
Aug18-24
Preliminary Announcement The 3rd International Con-
ference of Quantitative Genetics
Zheijiang University, Hangzhou, China August 18-24,
2007
The 3rd International Conference on Quantitative Ge-
netics (ICQG) will be held during August 18-24, 2007 at
Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. As with the
1st ICQG in Ames, Iowa in 1976 and the 2nd ICQG
in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1987, the 3rd Conference
will be a comprehensive survey of the current status of
quantitative genetics. New technologies in areas rang-
ing from genomics and molecular genetics to statistics
are providing both opportunities and challenges for our
understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits
in natural populations, the evolution of characters, and
use for plant and animal breeding. Program sugges-
tions will be welcomed by the Conference Organizers
listed below.
Zhejiang University is one of the few top-rank research
institutions in China. It is a comprehensive institute
with a full range of disciplines. With a faculty capable
of top-level and large-scale research and a high pro-
portion of graduate students, the university has been
undertaking projects, both basic and applied, to ad-
dress pressing issues and challenges of today and of the
future.
The City of Hangzhou is one of the seven ancient cap-
ital cities of China. It has a population of 3.72 mil-
lion and has a recorded history spanning 2100 years.
Marco Polo described Hangzhou as the “Most beauti-
ful, magniﬁcent, and heavenly city in the world.” Lo-
cated in China’s most developed southeast coastal area,
Hangzhou is renowned for its thriving economy, color-
ful culture and beautiful landscape, especially its famed
West Lake and Tea House.

Mar13-14
Announcement of a two day Discussion Meeting on
’Species and Speciation in Micro-organisms’
Venue: The Royal Society in London, UK, on 13th and
14th March 2006.
The meeting will focus on the evolutionary processes
that generate the vast array of species that we see in
prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes.
“After three billion years of evolution only 5,000 bac-
terial species are known compared to over a million
animal species that have evolved in only 600 million
years. Bacterial species have been deﬁned without any
coherent concept of species, but advances in bacterial
population biology, and increasing interest in the vast
diversity of microbial life, is leading to new insights intomicrobial speciation.”
Details of how to register for the meeting (which is free)
can be found at the following webpage, along with the
meeting program.

CornellU EvolGenetics
Graduate programs in Evolutionary Genetics and Evo-
lutionary Genomics at Cornell University
Cornell University provides many outstanding opportu-
nities for graduate or postdoctoral study and research
in evolutionary genomics. We have excellent groups
working on many model and non-model animal, plant
and microbial systems, and with programs that in-
clude (and integrate) experimental, analytical, func-
tional, statistical and computational approaches to the
study of genomic and organismal diversity and to the
inference of function and functional diversiﬁcation. Im-
portantly, there is a tremendous spirit of interaction
and collaboration within and among groups that fa-
cilitates ability of students and postdocs to learn and
apply the full scope of tools, skills, and perspectives
important to evolutionary genomics today.
There are several programs, called “ﬁelds” that are ac-
tively seeking applications for new graduate students.
At Cornell, only these interdepartmental ﬁelds grant
advanced degrees, and because departments do not
even grant degrees, cross departmental collaboration is
exceptionally easy and natural here. Many of the grad-
uate ﬁelds will appear to overlap, so the best way toﬁnd out which is right for you is to study the websites.
Here is a quick run down:
Graduate Field of Genetics and Development
www.mbg.cornell.edu/GandD.cfm If you are par-
ticularly interested in genetic mechanisms of evolution,
or have a strong aﬃnity for model genetic organisms
and their role in evolutionary genomics, or have a
strong interest in functional genomics or evolutionary
developmental genetics, this ﬁeld is the one for you.
Some of the Genetics and Development faculty that
have a strong interest in evolutionary genetics include
Chip Aquadro, Dan Barbash, Ed Buckler, Carlos Bus-
tamante, Andy Clark, Rick Harrison, Brian Lazzaro,
June Nasrallah, and Mariana Wolfner. Deadline for
graduate applications: Jan 5.
Graduate Field of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology <http://www.eeb.cornell.edu/ﬁeld/-
EEB.html >www.eeb.cornell.edu/ﬁeld/EEB.html
This ﬁeld spans evolutionary ecology, ecological ge-
netics, speciation, and population genetics. If your
primary interests include ecological components of the
determinants of evolutionary change, or the role of the
environment in organismal ﬁtness, this program is for
you. Out of the set of 51 faculty in this graduate ﬁeld,
the following have a primary interest in evolutionary
genetics: Chip Aquadro, Andy Clark, Rick Durrett,
Rick Harrison and Irby Lovette. Deadline for graduate
applications: Dec 1.
Graduate Field of Computational Biology
www.cb.cornell.edu This is a newly formed grad-
uate ﬁeld that spans a wide range of applications
of serious computational modeling to problems in
bioinformatics, biomechanics, population dynamics,
protein structure, epidemiology, gene regulatory
networks, quantitative genetics and complex traits,
evolutionary genomics or statistical genomics. Some of
the faculty with an interest in evolutionary genomics
include Carlos Bustamante, Andy Clark, Ron Elber,
Uri Keich, Jason Mezey, and Adam Siepel. Deadline
for graduate applications: Jan 5.
Other relevant graduate ﬁelds In addition there
are several other somewhat more specialized pro-
grams that include very strong coverage of evo-
lutionary biology, including Entomology, Plant Bi-
ology, Biometry, and Applied Math. You can
also learn more about academic programs and fa-
cilities at Cornell from the individual departmen-
tal websites, including Molecular Biology and Ge-
netics ( www.mbg.cornell.edu ), Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology ( www.eeb.cornell.edu ), Biological Statistics
and Computational Biology ( www.bscb.cornell.edu ),
Plant Breeding and Genetics (plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu)10 EvolDir January 1, 2006

family, ca. 15 km south of Vienna. IIASA’s summer
program oﬀers exceptional opportunities for acquiring
experience in an international and interdisciplinary re-
search environment. Research training is based on in-
tensive personal interaction with advising senior scien-
tists, and typically leads to a publication in an interna-
tional journal (and often to a chapter in a candidate’s
PhD thesis).
Students from Austria, China, Estonia, Finland, Ger-
many, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia,
Sweden, and the USA are eligible for fellowships provid-
ing full coverage, including travel, accommodation, and
living expenses. Young scientists from all countries are
eligible for stipends, provided by the ADN Program,
contributing to travel and accommodation costs.
Model-based summer projects are invited for research

HostParasiteCoEvol
Experimental host-parasite coevolution in yeast
We are looking for a Ph.D. student to study host-
parasite coevolution in experimental and natural pop-
ulations of yeast. Many strains of yeast are infected
with intracellular genetic parasites (DNA plasmids and
RNA viruses) that replicate at the expense of their host.
Although geneticists have known about these parasites
for a long time, little is known about their ecology and
evolution. We outline some of the interesting questions
that we think could be investigated with this system be-
low, although these could easily be changed depending
on the interests of the student.
The studentship is funded by NERC (UK) and the stu-
dent will be based at the NERC Centre for Population
Biology located at the Silwood Park campus of Impe-
rial College London. The Centre for Population Biol-
ogy oﬀers students access to an outstanding group of
researchers in evolution and ecology as well as excellent
lab facilities. The stipend is £14 K a year and eligibility
would be the same as for NERC studentships. Closing
date for applications is February 19th, 2006.
This position is ideal for students who would like to12 EvolDir January 1, 2006
carry out independent research project in a stimu-
lating and challenging environment. Experience in
microbiology and molecular biology are assets, but
they are not required. Interested applicants should
send a cv detailing their experience and interests to
Craig MacLean. Ideally, the student would begin their
project in September, 2006.

Supervisors: Tim Barraclough, Gerard Bishop (Divi-
sion of Biology, Imperial College London) Sandy Knapp

Ecological divergence is known to be an important
cause of speciation. Without it, rates of population
divergence appear to be tediously slow. But how it
occurs in practise remains unclear. Certain conditions
are needed in sexual organisms to prevent interbreed-
ing between emerging species, but the relative impor-
tant of the diﬀerent proposed mechanisms is unclear.
We’re looking for a student to tackle these questions
in the Solanum nigrum complex, widespread annual
weeds related to tomato and other crops. The work
will combine ﬁeld experiments, evolutionary genomics,
systematics, and evolutionary theory, tailored to the
student’s own interests. You would be based at the
Silwood Park campus of Imperial College. You would
also work regularly at the Natural History Museum
and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Further details
available on request. To apply, please send a CV and
a covering letter outlining your interests to Tim Bar-
raclough, t.barraclough@imperial.ac.uk. Applications
received before the 14th January 2006 will be treated
equally.

involved in organismal responses to the environment.
This Ecological Genomics initiative takes advantage of
existing strengths at Kansas State University in genet-
ics and genomics, ecology and evolutionary biology to
answer cross-cutting questions that lie at the interface
of genomics and ecology. This collaborative research
eﬀort will cross disciplines (genetics and ecology) and
departments. In addition, this initiative will also take
advantage of experimental manipulations at the Konza
Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.
Research and education opportunities exist for Grad-
uate Students to work towards an MS or PhD de-
gree in this large collaborative and interdisciplinary
eﬀort. More information about the Kansas Ecologi-
cal Genomics collaborative research groups at Kansas
State University can be found at www.ksu.edu/ecogen .
Twenty faculty with interests spanning from genetics
and genomics of model organisms (Arabidopsis, C. el-
egans, Drosophila) to microbial, plant and animal or-
ganismic biology, and ecosystem ecology are involved
in this new research initiative. Applicants should have
the interest and willingness to cross disciplines.
Completed applications must be received by January
15, 2006.For more information on how to apply, visit

MelbourneU AmphibianPopulations
Two positions for PhD students in molecular ecology
Melbourne University and Museum Victoria, Australia
We seek two postgraduate students to work together
with us on a project entitled “Human-induced changes
in the genetic structure of amphibian populations.” We
will compare data gathered from museum specimens
of frogs collected 40 years ago with similar data from
current populations, to discover how genetic popula-
tion structure has been modiﬁed by diﬀerent forms of
landscape change. Results will support a predictive
model of the impact of urban development on the ge-
netic structure of populations, and contribute to land-
use planning in the greater Melbourne area. Students
will gain experience using molecular markers, phylogeo-
graphic analysis, GIS modeling, and ancient DNA.
The two positions are funded by a Linkage grant from
the Australian Research Council, and include an annual
tax-free salary of $24,650 for three years, extra support
for relocation and producing the thesis, and funds for
conducting the research itself. Students will be enroled
in the Department of Zoology at the University of Mel-
bourne, but will also have oﬃces at Museum Victoria
(about 1 km from the university), and will do most of
their labwork in the Museum. Fieldwork occurs in and
around Melbourne.
The project involves collaboration among people from
several institutions, so the students can expect to
interact with Josh Van Buskirk (University of Mel-
bourne), Jane Melville (Museum Victoria), Kirsten

Research on the use of transgenic mosquitoes for de-
creasing the prevalence of dengue virus diseases in de-
veloping countries.
We are looking for a PhD student who is interested
in conducting research aimed at driving anti-pathogen
genes (refractoriness) into mosquito populations. The
main emphasis of the student’s research can be in
the areas of 1) estimating ecological parameters in
mosquito life histories that will impact the spread of
anti-pathogen transgenes, 2) building population ge-
netics models of gene drive mechanisms, 3) estimating
mosquito population structure through use of molecu-
lar genetic approaches, or could work on a project that
combines two or more of the above areas. The stu-
dent could either become a member of the Entomology
or the Genetics Department and North Carolina State
University.
Our lab is funded by NIH and the Gates Founda-
tion and is part of an interdisciplinary group composed
of mosquito ecologists, geneticists, disease epidemiolo-
gists, molecular biologists, ethicists, and scientists from
disease-endemic countries, all working to develop novel
transgenic strategies for disease reduction. The student
in this position will focus on a speciﬁc project but will
also interact with members of this team and thereby
acquire a broad understanding of the challenges facing
scientists who want to move their research from the lab
bench all the way to successful implementation.
An overview of this area of research and an entry point
to the literature can be found in

Evolution of Sexual Communication Systems in Moths
Background Information: Most night-ﬂying moth
species locate mates through production of, and re-
sponse to, a very precise blend of two or more volatile
chemical compounds. Within a population, females
with atypical blends have been shown to be less at-
tractive to males than females with the population’s
common blend. Similarly, rare males that respond to
atypical blends have been found to be at a disadvantage
in ﬁnding mates. The genes that control pheromone
blend ratios have never been found to be linked to, or
aﬀect male response, so mutations that cause changes
in each of the two components of communication are
expected to arise independently. On a simple theoret-
ical level, this type of sexual communication system is
expected to be evolutionarily constrained because an
individual with a mutation leading to an altered blend
or response will be selected against, when rare. Even
if the selective disadvantage to rare individuals with
alleles for novel signals or responses is minimal, mass
selection is not expected to increase their frequency in
the population. Based on these assumptions it is diﬃ-
cult to account for the great diversiﬁcation of chemical
mixtures used in mate communication by over 10,000
moth species. We are investigating a number of poten-
tial evolutionary mechanisms that could have resulted
in this diversiﬁcation by dissecting the genetic under-
pinnings of selective mating in moths.
We are working with two sympatric moth species (He-
liothis virescens and Heliothis subﬂexa) that have very
distinct sex pheromone blends, do not mate in the wild,
but can be induced to mate in the lab. We have mapped
a number of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) that control
production of speciﬁc female sex pheromone compo-
nents and male response to these components. We have
moved two speciﬁc QTL between species and tested
their impacts on mating in the ﬁeld. We have also iden-
tiﬁed a number of candidate genes that appear to be
involved in male response to speciﬁc pheromone com-ponents.
We are now in a good position to test candidate genes
and to determine the genetic and molecular basis for
diﬀerences between the sexual communication systems
of these two moth species. We are looking for a PhD
student who has basic knowledge of molecular tech-
niques and wants to use these techniques to answer
questions about insect evolution.

PhD Studentship Tracking Lapita Peoples through
Phylogenetic Analyses of Paciﬁc Rats
The human settlement of the Paciﬁc and the origin ofJanuary 1, 2006 EvolDir 17
the Polynesians have been topics of debate for centuries.
Polynesian origins are most immediately traced to peo-
ple who arrived in the Fiji, Tonga and Samoa region
around 3000 BP and are clearly associated with the
Lapita Cultural Complex. While this scenario of the
immediate origins of the Polynesians is generally ac-
cepted, the debate on the ultimate origin of the Poly-
nesians and Lapita Peoples continues. Our previous re-
search has shown that analyses of mitochondrial DNA
variation in the Paciﬁc rat (Rattus exulans), trans-
ported in the colonising canoes, are valuable for tracing
prehistoric human migration within Polynesia.
We are seeking a PhD student to join a multi-
disciplinary research team investigating the movements
of those rats introduced by Lapita peoples, and possibly
those also introduced by people moving into the region
prior to the arrival of the Lapita Cultural Complex. In
this research project you will analyse DNA from ancient
and modern R. exulans populations in the Paciﬁc. You
will use new methods of analysis of population-level ge-
netic variation, incorporating a range of biological and
chronological data, to identify paths of introduction,
test models of Lapita origins and identify pre-Lapita
interactions in the region.
This is a joint research project involving Dr Lisa
Matisoo-Smith and Judith Robins, University of Auck-
land Department of Anthropology and Prof Mike
Hendy, Massey University Institute of Fundamental
Sciences, all members of the Allen Wilson Centre for
Molecular Ecology and Evolution, and Dr Howard Ross
University of Auckland School of Biological Sciences.
We are seeking a PhD student with experience in molec-
ular genetic analyses (DNA extraction, PCR ampli-
ﬁcation and sequencing) and computational phyloge-
netics. The scholarship includes an annual stipend of
NZ$25,000 for 3 years, from which the student is ex-
pected to pay tuition fees. Note that as from 1 January
2006 international PhD students will be charged tuition
fees at the NZ domestic rate (approximately NZ$3500
per annum).

Microevolution in wild bird populations in response to
climate change
We are looking for a PhD student to study the eﬀects
of changing environmental conditions on microevolu-
tion in natural environments. Using long-term records
from several studies of great tits (Parus major) in the
Netherlands, the project will quantify temporal changes
in key components of ﬁtness (fecundity, survival, breed-
ing time) and in individuals’ ability to respond to dif-
ferent environments (plasticity). The project will fo-
cus on temporal changes in both the selection on and
the heritability of important traits, of plasticity in
these traits, and in the genetic correlations between
them, in order to identify genotype-environment inter-
actions and ultimately to predict rates of microevo-
lution. This will provide an illustration of the po-
tential for climate change to shape genetic architec-
ture and hence to drive evolution in natural popula-
tions. The study will involve a combination of statis-
tical analysis and ﬁeldwork, and the student would be
part of the research groups of Loeske Kruuk in Edin-
burgh (homepages.ed.ac.uk/loeske) and Marcel Visser

Population ecology of swarming bats Supervisors: John
Altringham and Roger Butlin
Many European bat species live in small colonies dur-
ing the summer, with little or no interchange between
neighbouring colonies. At the end of the summer
colonies disperse as the bats mate and prepare for hi-
bernation. Individuals of many species visit their un-
derground hibernation sites from August to November
to ’swarm’. There is now strong evidence to suggest
that swarming is the primary mating system in sev-
eral species and plays a signiﬁcant role in determin-
ing population structure. The project will investigate
how population structure is determined by factors such
as geography, ecology and rarity, by comparing related
species (caught at swarming sites) using microsatellite
and mitochondrial DNA. We will compare, for exam-
ple: (1) species with similar ecology, but greatly dif-
ferent abundances (2) abundant species with diﬀerent
dispersal abilities and ecology (3) species in cave-rich
and cave-poor landscapes. A knowledge of swarming
dynamics and population structure and an ability to
model gene ﬂow are potentially important in the de-
velopment of conservation strategies for rare swarming
species. The work will be carried out in the UK and
continental Europe.

How important is biodiversity for carbon cycling in
tropical forests? Supervisors: Tim Baker, Simon Lewis
and Oliver Phillips
A major focus of current ecological research is com-
mitted to understanding how biodiversity is related to
ecosystem properties, such as biomass and productiv-
ity. It is particularly important to understand these
relationships in tropical forests as these ecosystems are
a critical component of the global carbon cycle. ThisJanuary 1, 2006 EvolDir 21
project will relate tree structure to tree mass and car-
bon content, for a range of functional types of tree in
tropical forests in Peru and/or Cameroon, and use these
relationships to assess the contribution of biodiversity
to current and future ecosystem properties and substan-
tially improve regional to global-scale carbon budgets.

Dispersal, gene ﬂow and population biology in a Namib
Desert ﬁg tree and its pollinator Supervisors: Steve
Compton, Phil Gilmartin and Simon Goodman
We have been using plant microsatellites to follow the
movements of ﬁg wasps in Namibia via the pollen they
are carrying. On the Ugab River, which runs through
the Namib Desert, we found that ﬁg wasps can polli-
nate trees over 100 kms from their parent trees - pollina-
tion distances many times further than known from any
other plant. Using similar techniques, but based at the
Gobabeb Training and Research Centre on the Kuiseb
River, this project will build on the preliminary work
and examine seasonal variation in the direction and dis-
tances of movements (predominant winds and fruiting
frequencies change with season), and whether the diver-
sity of pollen donors is greater for more isolated trees.
By quantifying the relationship between how far trees
are apart and the likelihood that wasps can make it be-
tween them we can predict the likely consequences of
expected future losses of trees from the rivers.

Stochastic methods for invasive populations Supervisor:
Stephen Cornell
The biology of invasion has repercussions throughout
applied ecology and epidemiology, but theoretical stud-
ies have focussed on the use of deterministic models
whereas stochastic processes are known to be an im-
portant component of population dynamics. While
the equations describing spatially extended stochastic
populations cannot be solved exactly, there has been
an important recent advance (Ovaskainen and Cornell,
Theor. Pop. Biol., in press) which enables spatial inter-
actions to be accounted for in an exactly solvable limit.
The aim of this studentship is to extend the methods
of Ovaskainen and Cornell, who studied the case of a
resident species distributed throughout all space, to ge-
ometries appropriate to an invading species. Topics to
be covered include: the eﬀect of stochasticity on the
speed and the stability of an invasive front; the eﬀect of
locally heterogeneous habitat on an invasive front; the

ULouisianaMonroe EvolBiology
The Department of Biology and the Museum of Nat-
ural History at the University of Louisiana at Monroe
(ULM) are looking to recruit graduate students inter-
ested in the evolution and ecology of freshwater snails to
their MS in Biology program for SPRING 2006. Most
research focuses on the family Pleuroceridae, a group of
gill breathing, operculate snails that reaches its great-
est diversity in the southeastern United States. Cur-
rently, potential projects include evolutionary ecology,
life history studies, and the evolution of morphological
variation in cryptic taxa as it applies to environmental
factors. Depending on pending grant proposals, some
molecular work may be included.
Based on availability, students can be paid either as
teaching or research assistants. Both include full tu-
ition waivers and are available on a competitive basis;
research assistantships carry no teaching responsibili-
ties. The typical assistantship at ULM is $8,000 per
year, though this amount may increase, again depend-
ing on grant outcomes. Monroe is a city of 56,000 peo-
ple on the banks of the Ouachita River in north-central
Louisiana, and serves as the educational, commercial,
and economic hub of the Delta parishes. The cost of
living is very reasonable, and the city tends to dodge
major weather-related events (in other words, the hur-
ricanes missed us).
Students seeking admission to the Biology Graduate
Program must ﬁrst be admitted to the ULM Gradu-
ate School. Application forms may be obtained online
from the Oﬃce of Graduate Studies and Research. In
addition to a minimum undergraduate GPA of 2.5, the
Biology Graduate Program requires either a score of
900 or higher on the GRE General Test (combined ver-
bal and quantitative scores), or a total of 2400 points
when the GPA is multiplied by the combined verbal
and quantitative GRE General Test scores.22 EvolDir January 1, 2006
Interested students should contact Dr. Russ

UMassAmherst ScaleInsectEvol
In spite of their unassuming appearance, SCALE
INSECTS display remarkable evolutionary dynam-
ics in many aspects of their biology, including: –
Genetic systems: multiple origins of diﬀerent kinds
of haplodiploidy (arrhenotoky, diploid arrhenotoky,
germline paternal genome elimination, embryonic pa-
ternal genome elimination); the only known evolution-
ary reversions of haplodiploidy back to diplodiploidy;
the only cases of hermaphroditism in insects; many ori-
gins of thelytokous parthenogenesis. –Coevolution with
endosymbiotic bacteria: frequent replacements of one
primary endosymbiont clade by another, and rapid evo-
lution of the mode of transmission and the morphology
of the infected tissues (the bacteriome). Even the genet-
ics of the bacteriome is unstable, with some scale insect
families having polyploid bacteriomes incorporating po-
lar body genomes, much like the endosperm of a plant.
–Coevolution with hostplants (extreme polyphagy, lo-
cal adaptation), parasitoids (classical targets of biolog-
ical control; local adaptation of parastioids & hosts),
fungi (“animal lichens:” intimate, possibly mutualistic
associations with Septobasidium). –Morphology and
physiology: Extreme morphological reduction of ﬂight-
less larviform female; holometaboly in male. Little vari-
ation in male genitalia but enormous variation in sperm
morphology (especially number and arrangement of mi-
crotubules). Movement of sperm to ovum mediated by
a “vestibule cell” in female, possibly analogous to a
stigma of a plant. Incomplete gut (no anus) in some
lineages. Variation from oviparity and ovoviviparity to
full (placental) viviparity. Frequent origin of ﬂightless-
ness in males. The fact that many scale insects are
economically destructive pests opens up many oportu-
nities for collaborative contacts, ﬁeld experiements, and
funding sources.An NSF-FUNDED GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSIS-
TANTSHIP ($27,000 / year) is available for the study
of the phylogenetics and evolution of scale insects in
the laboratory of Benjamin Normark at the University
of Massachusetts Amherst, leading to a Ph.D in En-
tomology or in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
Substantial domestic and international travel funds are
available for conference attendance and ﬁeld work. In-
terested students should contact Dr. Normark (bnor-
mark@ent.umass.edu) and should apply to the UMass
graduate program in Organismic and Evolutionary Bi-
ology (deadline 15 January 2006) and/or the graduate

Evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions.
I am interested in the impact that parasites have on
the ecology and evolution of their hosts. I would like
to ﬁnd a Ph.D. student to work in one of the following
areas: (1) Local adaptation of hosts to variation in par-
asite communities, and its potential to lead to divergent
evolution (immunological or molecular genetic experi-
ence could be useful). (2) Host-parasite interactions
during the course of biological invasions. (3) The im-
pact of parasitism on other ecological interactions (e.g.
competition and predation).
I work mainly with three-spined sticklebacks in Scot-
land and Canada, but research in other systems includ-
ing birds, insects and snails is possible.

host-parasite interactions and the evolutionary ecology
of natural populations. NSF has recommended fund-
ing, including graduate student support, for a project
on male-killing Wolbachia in Drosophila innubila. Wol-
bachia are maternally transmitted bacteria that manip-
ulate host reproduction, and they are present in ~25%
of all insect species. The overall goal of the research is
to link the dynamics of Wolbachia density within indi-
vidual ﬂies to the infection dynamics in natural pop-
ulations of D. innubila. The research will entail both
ﬁeld work in the sky islands of Arizona and laboratory
work at the University of Rochester.
The University of Rochester is one of the nation’s lead-
ing research universities, and the Department of Biol-
ogy has an outstanding group in evolutionary biology,
including Tom Eickbush, Jim Fry, Rich Glor (start-
ing in 2006), John Jaenike, Dave Lambert, Allen Orr,
Daven Presgraves, Justin Ramsey, and Jack Werren.
Rochester is located in upstate New York, where attrac-
tions include the Finger Lakes region (which has sailing,
wind-surﬁng, and wine country), excellent downhill and
cross-country skiing, and a ﬁrst-rate music scene (in-
cluding the Eastman School of Music and the Rochester

upon these. Of particular interest are the responses
of plant communities to disturbances such as ﬁre, nu-
trient enrichment, fragmentation and grazing, and the
complex interactions between them. You will be ex-
pected to develop research projects in a number of key
landscape types, including highly fragmented cropping
zones, peri-urban fringes and rapidly urbanising coastal
areas. The research will be conducted within the con-
text of multi-disciplinary teams seeking to improve our
ability to contribute to the development of sustainable
and resilient agricultural and peri-urban landscapes.
The successful applicant will have good ﬁeld ecological
skills, experience in quantitative plant ecology, and an
aptitude and interest in ecological modelling. Experi-
ence in plant population genetics may be advantageous.

**Field assistants needed
We are looking for enthusiastic ﬁeld assistants to partic-
ipate in an international research project on communi-
cation and behavioural ecology in nightingales (/Lus-
cinia megarhynchos/). The project at the Research
Station Petite Camargue Alsacienne in France is run
by Dr. Valentin Amrhein (University of Basel, Switzer-
land), Dr. Marc Naguib and Rouven Schmidt (Univer-
sity of Bielefeld, Germany). At the research station,
we have been studying the breeding ecology of nightin-
gales since 1994 using multiple techniques including ra-
diotelemetry, colourbanding, and monitoring of terri-
torial behaviour. To investigate vocal communication
strategies of nightingales, we record songs (including
nocturnal song) and make playback experiments. More
information on our research and the ﬁeld site is avail-
able at http://www.unibielefeld.de/biologie/vhf/NG/-
Nightingale page.html andhttp://pages.unibas.ch/pca
.The ﬁeld site is situated in France, about 10 km north
of Basel (Switzerland). Field assistants will receive 800
Euro for the entire ﬁeld season. We cannot cover travel
expenses, but we oﬀer free accommodation and use of
the infrastructure at the research station. Field assis-
tants are expected to stay for the entire ﬁeld season
from about 10 April to end of May 2006. Field work
will be conducted during the day and at night. Field as-
sistants are expected to work on their own at night and
thus should be comfortable with working in a dark and
lonesome place. The language at the station will be En-
glish. Applications will be viewed starting 15.01.06 and
will be considered until the positions are ﬁlled. Please
send applications in English (letter of motivation, two
references and curriculum vitae) until 31.01.06 via e-

France PermanentResearcher
Dear all
This is to inform you about an attractive job oﬀer
in France the yearly announcement of researcher po-
sitions ﬁnanced by the French Funding Organization
Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS).
These are *life-time 100 % research* positions of-
fered in an international competition to excellent can-
didates. The web page is http://www.sg.cnrs.fr/-
drhchercheurs/concoursch/default-en.htm . Posts areavailable, for instance in Biodiversity, evolution and
biological adaptations: from macromolecules to com-
munities, and Biological systems modelization, bioin-
formatics. The deadline, regrettably, is January, 16.
THE TYPES OF POSTS (see also http://-
www.sg.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/chercheur/-
default-en.htm, http://www.sg.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/-
concoursch/informer/default-en.htm, http://-
www.sg.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/pdf/-
guide-en.pdf ): There are charg´ es de recherche, 2nd and
1st degree, and directeurs de recherche, 2nd and 1st
degree, i.e. Associate Scientists after dissertation and
after 4 years of experience, and Senior Scientists after 8
years or 12 years of experience, respectively. According
to my experience already the Charg´ es de Recherche are
actually free to do what they want within an overall,
very large disciplinary category (there are some 40
categories deﬁned for all sciences together). Directeurs
are of course expected to, ﬁnally, develop leading roles.
This may mean becoming leader of a team as proposed
and agreed upon by the Research Unit (Unit´ e Mixte de
Recherche, UMR) and to search for extramural funds,
which are scarce in France. Experience in such leading
functions is thus an important plus for an application
to a directeur post. And of course publications. Even
though strange things are happening, multiple ﬁrst or
senior authored publications per year with an overall
impact of 4 or more seem to be useful, but its open
end. For Charg´ e, 2nd degree, several good publications
from the PhD are probably needed.
THE PROFILES If you go to http://-
gestionoﬀres.dsi.cnrs.fr/fo/oﬀres/default-en.php you
will ﬁnd a number of posts oﬀered in the sections 29
(Biodiversity, evolution and biological adaptations:
from macromolecules to communities), 44 (Biological
systems modelization, bioinformatics), and also 20
(Continental Surfaces and Interfaces, which includes
vegetation). But note that by further clicking on the
numbers given to the jobs (e.g. N29/02) you will ﬁnd
that the Charg´ e positions (Associate Scientists) in
sections 29 and 20 are focused to quite restricted ﬁelds
of research. This is where science politics comes into
play.
THE RECRUITMENT Directeur (Senior scientists)
posts are told be more diﬃcult to obtain for someone
that comes from outside the French system. A so-called
poste rouge is often recommended in advance, a fund-
ing for half a year within the host institution. Even
for demanding a Charg´ e position, advance visits in the
host lab may be appreciated. Obviously, this is hardly
possible anymore for the deadline 16 January 06. A
visit to the lab after having submitted the application
seems to be very much expected in all cases. Generally,30 EvolDir January 1, 2006
French institutions *do not* reimburse candidates the
travel costs to visit labs or to come to interviews etc..
Yes, this is a shame. I hope we have some funds here
at Rennes, but this is not sure.
After having applied *all* candidates will be invited
to a presentation and an interview in Paris in spring
2006 (see http://www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/calend/-
printe06/cprint06.pdf ). Travel costs will *not* be re-
imbursed by the CNRS, and on the level of host Units
funds may be scarce, too. Presentations and interviews
can be in English, French is possibly a plus.
I personally could oﬀer help in putting together an ap-
plication for qualiﬁed candidates with a project willing
to choose University of Rennes 1 and to work here on
the interface between ecology and phylogeny preferably
of plants or, alternatively, on the diversity and diversi-
ﬁcation of arthropods in the canopy. The host lab here
is the UNITE MIXTE DE RECHERCHE ECOSYS-
TEMES , BIODIVERSITE , EVOLUTION with par-
ticular expertise in mechanisms of speciation, life his-
tory evolution, and adaptation, expertise at the inter-
face between macroevolution and macroecology, exper-
tise in ecophysiology, landscape ecology and soon also
behavioral ecology. It is a large institution with

TreeMicrobeInteractions
Population genetics of forest pathogens:
A 1st class junior scientist permanent position (Charg´ e
de Recherche 1` ere classe, CR1) is opened for applicationat the INRA-Nancy “Tree-Microbe Interactions” Unit
(UMR 1136 IAM). This Unit is conducting extensive re-
search on the molecular biology, physiology, pathology
and ecology of trees and associated micro-organisms
in forest ecosystems. The Unit is composed of staﬀ
from the INRA (Institut National de la Recherche
Agronomique), the University Henri Poincar´ e (UHP),
undergraduate and Ph.D Students, and postdoctoral
fellows.
Within the “Tree-Microbe Interactions” Unit, the For-
est Pathology group mainly focuses on epidemiology
and population biology of several forest pathogens. The
two main pathogens studied are the biotrophic Basid-
iomycete Melampsora larici-populina (causing poplar
rust) and the hybrid Oomycete Phytophthora alni (re-
sponsible of alder decline).
The main objective of the current position is to de-
velop population genetics approaches in order to better
understand the epidemiology and the evolution of fun-
gal forest pathogens, and to study the processes driv-
ing the pathogen population structure: selection, gene
ﬂow, migration, genetic drift, mating system. Molecu-
lar markers, such as microsatellites, have already been
developed for the main pathogens studied.
Candidates should have a strong background in pop-
ulation genetics and/or evolutionary biology. Candi-
dates should also be familiar with the use of molecular
markers. Additional experience in fungal biology is not
required, but would be appreciated. A post-doctoral
experience would be highly desirable. The applicants
are requested to have a strong team spirit and to be
able to develop an integrated view of their research,
with strong interactions with researchers involved in
epidemiology, resistance breeding, genomics, and biol-
ogy of the pathogens.
The “Tree-Microbe Interactions” Unit is also involved
in the annotation of the complete genome sequences
of Populus trichocarpa ( http://genome.jgi-psf.org/-
Poptr1/Poptr1.info.html ), and its fungal associates,
the ectomycorhizal Basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor
(http://mycor.nancy.inra.fr/IMGC/LaccariaGenome/-
), and the poplar rust fungus, Melampsora larici-
populina ( http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/-
CSP2006/poplarrust.html ), in collaboration with
the US DoE JGI. The Melampsora sequence should
be available in 2006, and this will give invaluable
opportunities to develop additional molecular markers
useful for population genetic studies.

ratorial position in the MVZ (50%). It will be an
11 month appointment, in recognition of the year-
round duties of a curator. Faculty Curators are ex-
pected to demonstrate both a strong conceptual fo-
cus in some area of Vertebrate Evolutionary Biology
and/or Ecology, and leadership towards development
of and research on the MVZ’s renowned collections.
Accordingly, those invited for interview will be asked
to give two seminars, one in the Integrative Biology
series and another to the MVZ. This MVZ Curator-
ship requires enthusiasm for collection-based research
and excitement about the opportunities oﬀered by us-
ing mammals as a study sytstem to advance evolution-
ary and/or ecological theory. The potential to acquire
broad knowledge of the systematics and biology of ex-tant mammals is expected. In general MVZ curators
study organisms in relation to their natural environ-
ment and bring new technologies and sources of evi-
dence to bear on problems in evolution and ecology; we
encourage new and innovative approaches to the the
use of museum collections in such endeavors. Details
of the MVZ’s philosophy, history, existing research foci
and current initiatives are to be found on the website

Description: The University of California is creating a
dynamic new university campus and campus commu-
nity in Merced, California, which opened in September
2005 as the tenth campus of the University of Califor-
nia and the ﬁrst American research university built in
the 21st century. In keeping with the mission of the
University to provide teaching, research and public ser-
vice of the highest quality, UC Merced will be provid-
ing new educational opportunities at the undergradu-
ate, masters and doctoral levels through three academic
schools: Engineering, Natural Sciences and Social Sci-
ences/Humanities/Arts.
The Schools of Natural Science and Engineering in-
vite applications at the assistant professor level (tenure
track) in the areas of experimental or computational
systems biology. Systems biology is used here to mean
a research approach that uses comprehensive datasets
and multiple types of analysis to relate the overall func-
tion of an organism, organelle, or regulatory pathway
to the underlying biochemical or biophysical processes,
with an ultimate goal of a predictive understanding
of the system?s behavior. Examples of problems ad-
dressed by systems biology include microbial quorum
sensing, metazoan development, or symbiotic relation-
ships in ecosystems. Applications of special relevance
to research emphases at UC Merced include the mech-
anisms of cell fate decisions, complex diseases, such as
asthma or diabetes, and microbial systems relevant to
disease or the environment.
The University of California at Merced is an aﬃrmative
action/equal opportunity employer with a strong insti-
tutional commitment to the achievement of diversity
among its faculty, staﬀ, and students. The University

of adaptive evolution. One of the main projects in
my lab involves an analysis of DNA sequence variation
in hemoglobin genes that are involved in physiologi-
cal adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia. In addition to
studies of DNA polymorphism within species, we are
also studying molecular evolution of hemoglobin and42 EvolDir January 1, 2006
various enzymes involved in energy metabolism (e.g.,
aspartate aminotransferase). A second project in the
lab involves a study of morphological diﬀerentiation in
populations of deer mice that are distributed across
forest-grassland ecotones in diﬀerent parts of North
America. We are studying genetically based skeletal
variation that is involved in adaptation to contrasting
environments. Research in the lab mainly involves a
combination of molecular biology lab work and compu-
tational analysis of genomic data.
For more details, see http://www.biosci.unl.edu/-

ENCE: Bachelor???s or Master???s degree in biology
or biochemistry. Knowledge of basic molecular biology
lab techniques is essential.
RESPONSIBILITIES: PCR ampliﬁcation, molecular
cloning, and DNA sequencing of nuclear genes in mice.

Angiosperm classiﬁcation
Dear colleagues,
The new version of my classiﬁcation of angiosperms
(“Systema Angiospermarum”, v.4.8) is now available
on the URL:
http://herba.msu.ru/shipunov/ang The main features
of the system are follows:
* system considers as much current data as possible;
* system is fully hierarchical;
* taxa are usually considered in most broad sense;
* system is traditional – paraphyletic taxa are widely
accepted;
* order of arrangement of taxa matters and reﬂects the
similarities between them;
* names of families are checked with the last work of
Hoogland and Reveal (2005) and corrections of Reveal
after XVII IBC (2005).You are very welcome to send your comments to the
my e-mail address.
With best wishes and regards,
Dr. Alexey B. Shipunov, Moscow

Assignment test
Hi:
I need to apply an assignment test for diﬀerent popu-
lations, but I have many questions
1- Is it possible to use assignment test for allozymes
data??
2- What is the best software for assignment test?
3- Using Arlequin software I get the likelihood for geno-
types, but I don’t get any probability to look for sta-
tistical diﬀerences in the genotypes asigned. How can I
get that probability?
4. Using Arlequin, How do I do plotting, for example
to plott the log-likelihood of individual sampled, what
value of those that the sofware give me should I use
as coordenates?, How do I choose one, are there any
arguments to make the choice?
Many thanks,

Applications for the Third Bernhard Rensch Prize for
Biological Systematics of the GfBS
The Bernhard Rensch Prize is awarded annually by the
Society of Biological Systematics (GfBS, Germany) to a
young scientist who has demonstrated exceptional work
in any area of biological systematics. The award was
launched by the GfBS according to a suggestion by the
recently deceased Prof. Dr. Ernst Mayr, an honorary
member of the GfBS, who also helped underwrite the
endowment for the prize with a generous contribution.
The prize honours the lifelong work of Bernhard Ren-
sch, one of the founders of the ’New Systematics’ (for
more information, see http://www.uni-muenster.de/-
Biologie.NeuroVer/ Verhaltensbiologie/rensch-d.html).
Eligible for consideration is any signiﬁcant work (e.g.,
Bachelors or Masters thesis, PhD dissertation, or the
equivalent) where the applicant is the sole or primary
author. The study can be in any area in which the GfBS
is involved, with botanical, paleontological, and zoolog-
ical (broadly deﬁned) studies all being equally desired.
All submitted work will be judged according to its scien-
tiﬁc quality, innovativeness and creativity by the Bern-
hard Rensch Committee, consisting of members of the
council of the GfBS and one additional, external jury
member.
The prize of 1000 Euro together with the Bernhard Ren-
sch Medal will be awarded at the Annual Meeting of the
Society, where the recipient will present the work in a
public seminar. The Society will pay all the costs of the
recipient associated with attending the annual meeting
as well as awarding a free one-year membership to the
Society.
The following is a summary of the key points associated
with an application for the prize: - The prize is open
to all members of the scientiﬁc community, whether or
not they are members of the GfBS. Candidates can be
either self-nominated or nominated by another person.
- The candidate must be either the sole or primary au-
thor of the nominated work. - Only works written in
either English or German can unfortunately be taken
into consideration. - The nominated work can be in
any of the areas of systematic botany, paleontology, or
zoology, each of which will be judged equally. - The
candidate must have defended their PhD no more than
three years before the submission deadline. - Appli-
cations must include two hardcopies of the nominated
work. A short summary of the candidate’s academic ca-
reer and any other relevant material, either about the
study or the candidate, is also welcome. - All appli-
cations must be received by August 31, 2006 and be
sent to the following: PD Dr. Uwe Fritz General Sec-

Blood heat treatment
Hi All,
“The USDA suggests heat treatments of either 56C for
3 hours or 60C for 30 minutes to destroy New Castle
Disease in avian blood imported into the US. Will ei-
ther of these treatments damage DNA in the blood if
whole blood is stored in a standard lysis buﬀer contain-

Blood sampling
Dear Evoldir members
I am planning some human blood samplings in ﬁeld

able to use a microcentrifuge if needed. I wonder if any
of you have some advice or protocol about minimum
handling & maximum DNA quality and quantity re-48 EvolDir January 1, 2006

BootstrappingML in PAUP
Dear All,
I am going to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree by using
Maximum Likelihood methods implemented in PAUP
using DNA sequences. The number of Taxa is smaller
than 40. Do you think I can run the bootstrapping op-
tion to get the results of statistical supporting for tree
branching under the ML set? If so, I would be grateful
if someone could send me a PAUP batch ﬁle for doing
such thing.
Cheers!

DMSO salt solution
Hello,
I was wondering if anyone has used DMSO salt solu-
tion to preserve insects. I was looking for non-ethanol
based preservation techniques and the DMSO - salt so-
lution seems like an option but has mostly been used
for mammalian tissues. I would appreciate input on
this or other non-cryogenic preservation options.
Thanks a lot!

DNA extraction kits
Dear Colleagues
Our lab has been using the Sigma kit (GenElute Mam-
malian Genomic DNA miniprep kit) for DNA extrac-
tion. The kit works well for Salmonids (muscle and ﬁn
tissue) but not for cichlid ﬁn clips. The other method
currently at our disposal is phenol-chloroform, which is
time consuming. Does anyone have any suggestions as
to alternative extraction kits, which have worked pre-
viously with cichlid ﬁn clips? Explanations as to why
this kit does not work for cichlid ﬁn clips would also be
welcome.
Many thanks

DNA from FishOrgans
Dear members,
I am looking for a DNA extraction protocol, either a kit
or method, to extract bacterial DNA from ﬁsh organs
(kidney and liver) for a bacterial resistance study. As
I plan to amplify bacterial DNA by PCR afterwards, I
need a very eﬃcient extraction method. I also need a
method that will be able to separate ﬁsh DNA from bac-
terial DNA, as the former will be more abundant in the
extraction product and may potentially interfere with
the PCR. I was planning to use the Quiagen DNeasy 96
tissue kit normally used for DNA extraction from tis-
sues, but I am afraid this will not be eﬃcient enough,
nor solve the problem of having a mixed ﬁsh/bacteria
DNA product.
Does anyone have some experience with this type of
problem? Any other suggestions of good extractionJanuary 1, 2006 EvolDir 49
protocols or DNA separation methods would also be
appreciated.
Thank you all,

Decision in Kitzmiller vs Dover
The decision just came down in Kitzmiller v. Dover.
The PDF can be downloaded here (right-click on the
word “decision”): http://www2.ncseweb.org/wp/?p=-
98
It’s a slam dunk in all respects and bears careful read-
ing on the issues of science/religion in public schools,
the creationist history of “intelligent design”, and the
“science” of intelligent design and irreducible complex-
ity.
The decision includes many pieces that I and other
NCSE staﬀ contributed to as pro bono consultants for
the plaintiﬀs. For example, the discovery of the cre-
ationist drafts of the ID book “Of Pandas and People”,
and the refutation of Behe’s “irreducible complexity,”
for example with 50 peer-reviewed articles on the evo-
lution of the immune system. This kind of thing is why
NCSE exists, check us out at http://www.ncseweb.org

Digital Gel Documentation
Dear Colleagues,
I am looking for a bench top (non-darkroom), digital
photo system to document agarose gels in my lab (with
UV transilluminator). I don’t need to do anything com-
plicated, just visualize and quantify PCR bands.The rub is that I only have about $2000 USD. This
seems like a lot of money for a digital camera, some ﬁl-
ters, a metal box, and a UV light box, but I can’t ﬁnd
a system that even approaches this price.
Any advice? Has anyone built their own? Any reason-
ably priced commercial products?
Thanks! I’ll post replies.

Hi Steve,
I’ve built my own out of plywood. Just a big box (3
x 4 x 4), painted black on the inside and black duct
tape covering the electrical holes. The trickiest part is
the door. I put a trim on the inside with black window
insulation tape all around the gap. We put an old cam-
era stand and a UV table inside. We use an old Kodak50 EvolDir January 1, 2006
digital camera. Anything on the market in the $300
or less range will work. You just need to be sure that
it can be controlled from the computer outside (take
picture, download, change settings, etc.).
Good luck,

I am in the throes of testing this myself. My experience
so far is that the digital SLR that I purchased on other
criteria (Canon 350D) is very good for everyday use
but not for publication quality prints. I made an care-
ful survey of ﬁlter transmission characteristics vs the
emission properties of EtBr and ascertained that the
Hoya G orange ﬁlter is the best one available, though
red Wratten 25 and other orange or red ﬁlters are also
usable. I have also set the camera to output B+W
and have tried diﬀerent “speed” settings up to ASA
1600. The latter may be a bit grainy, but is OK for lab
records.
With either of the ﬁlters and at any ASA setting I ﬁnd
the same problem that has inhibited other users in this
lab from going entirely digital; this is that background
weak bands attributable to the UV emission tubes ap-
pear in the pictures. This can be/has been avoided by
the purchase of a dichroic ﬁlter to accept a narrow band
of wavelengths around the EtBr peak, but these cost
US$250 approx and I do not want to spend as much.
The pesky bands are probably IR emission from the
tubes, and could also be ﬁltered out by a heat-absorbing
glass such as Schott KG5., but for this I have been
quoted UK £160 in a 58mm camera mount. I am look-
ing for an alternative source of heat-absorbing glass, e.g.
a derelict slide projector or enlarger, or a glass merchant
who happens to have a scrap of a glass that is some-
times used for windows (e.g. Calorex). Both Chance
and Pilkington sell heat-absorbent window glass, but
there is no call for it in this latitude.

Steve- We set up a system for gel image capture in
our lab pretty cheaply. This was a couple of years ago
so things may be a bit diﬀerent now. I got a Kodak
DC4800 camera wit 3.1 megapixel resolution. The keything is getting a camera that can 1) be controlled di-
rectly through a PC. Most have suitable software but
check it out ﬁrst; and 2) can take a ﬁlter holder on the
lens. Wee use a Tiﬀen deep-yellow ﬁlter (from Fisher)
for ethidium bromide gels. The diameter is 40.5 mm
so you need a ﬁlter adapter of that size for the cam-
era. Then you just need a transilluminator and a PC
to hook it up to. It take a bit of playing around to
get he settings on the camera optimized but all in all
it is quite straight forward. We use Adobe photoshop
to manipulate the images and a laser printer to print
them out but that is not really necessary. Hope that
helps. Best. Mike

Hi, Clare chemical research <http://-

www.clarechemical.com/orderusa.htm sells an in-

used with dyes like SYBRgreen instead of ethidium.
Those dyes are as eﬀective as ethidium, but more
expensive.
I have used the transilluminator with a Kodak digital
camera that had an adjustable exposure time(no spe-
cial ﬁlters required) It was mounted to a camera stand
and was connected to and controlled by a computer.

Drosophila enhancer trap
My fellow Evoldirers,
I was hoping that some of you might be able to help me
with a question that was addressed to me. Are there
known examples of Drosophila enhancer trap lines that
have dominant phenotypes associated with the inser-
tion mutations? I am not referring to the marker and
reporter genes carried by the enhancer trap construct
itself, but rather to the phenotypes that are produced
by the mutagenic eﬀects of the insertion on native genes
in the Drosophila genome.January 1, 2006 EvolDir 51
The identities of speciﬁc mutant lines, gene and allele
names, or references to papers that describe such dom-
inant phenotypes would all be much appreciated.

Endnote resources
Dear all
Having recently forked out a lot of money for a copy of
Endnote, I’ve been a bit disappointed to ﬁnd that evo-
lutionary and ecological users aren’t too well supported.
By this I mean that there aren’t many document tem-
plates, and the supplied journal title lists (in the term
lists folder) don’t include many journals that I want to
cite. Before I spend a happy day typing in lists of jour-
nal abbreviations, I thought I’d ask if anyone had put
anything like this on the ’net? I ran some searches but
“Endnote and evolution and resources” gets 97,000 hits
from Google...

Endnote resources answers
Dear All
Several people asked me to post what I found out about
Endnote resources for evolution and ecology, so here’s
a summary.
The best source of information for journal names and
abbreviations to import into your library is the website
maintained by the University of Queensland’s library:
http://www.library.uq.edu.au/faqs/endnote/ biologi-
caljournal titles 6.html
This has a ﬁle called ’Biosciences.txt“ available for
download with about 5,400 journal titles and abbre-
viations. You can import these directly into your jour-
nals term list. Be warned, though, there appears to
be a bug with Endnote 9 for Mac OS X. You can im-
port this list, but for some reason the program does not
recognise them properly. I ended up just typing them
all in anyway.
The Center for Ecology and Hydrology in the UK has
an archive of journal styles for Endnote at:
http://library.ceh.ac.uk/EndNote/endnotestyles.html
These are mostly ecological or environmental journals.
Some useful websites for ﬁnding out what the appro-
priate abbreviation for your citation of choice is are:

EvolEducation Kansas
Dear Colleagues,
You may ﬁnd that BONE WARS is a holiday gift fa-
vorite outside of Kansas as well... CARD GAME EN-
TERS EVOLUTION DISPUTE We’re making good on
our threat. Starting immediately, we’re oﬀering a 20%
discount to anyone in Kansas who buys BONE WARS:
The Game of Ruthless Paleontology from our online
retail store. The oﬀer is valid through December 31,
2005. We’ll also give the discount to anyone shipping
to Kansas, so feel free to send a copy to your cousin in
Topeka.
Why give a discount to Kansas? Simple: the Kansas
Board of Education has attempted to give equal space
in the state public school biology curriculum to the doc-
trine of “Intelligent Design,” claiming that it is a “sci-
entiﬁc theory” of the origin and development of life.
When real scientists complained that “Intelligent De-
sign” ﬁts none of the criteria for an actual scientiﬁc
theory, the Board responded by redeﬁning “science” so
that it is no longer limited to the search for natural
explanations for phenomena.
So we’re doing our part for science. BONE WARS
shows players how a scientiﬁc theory is developed and
tested, and they can learn lots of fun dinosaur lore along
the way. Best of all, one of the four “ruthless paleon-
tologists” in the game, Charles Sternberg, was actually
raised in Kansas and collected many important fossils
in the state.
If you’re one of the many Kansans that love science for
what it really is, you have our sympathy. We wish wecould do more to help. But we don’t have the awe-
inspiring power of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Formamide and Acrylamide
Disposal
Hello, EvolDir community,
Our laboratory is currently developing protocols for the
use of two chemicals involved in capillary DNA frag-
ment analysis: formamide and acrylamide-based poly-
mer solutions (namely ABI POP-4).
I am hoping to ﬁnd out how labs generally treat this
waste. Do you collect it and manage it as hazardous
waste? Dispose of it in the trash? Have other collection
or abatement protocols?
As with the recent ethidium bromide postings, the
MSDS forms for acrylamide polymers and formamide
are not detailed with regard to the disposal of these
products.
Thanks in advance for your comments. I will post a
summary of responses in about a week.

Formamide and Acrylamide
Responses
Hello again, EvolDir
Thank you to everyone who responded to my in-
quiry about disposing of formamide and acrylamide
waste. Below is my initial posting, followed by
the complete responses. In general, most labs treat
this waste as hazardous and have it collected with
ethidium bromide waste and the like. An excellent
source of guidelines for the disposal of lab chemi-
cals down the drain is: http://www.ehs.berkeley.edu/-
pubs/guidelines/draindispgls.html#appendices Better
safe than sorry, our lab will likely collect the waste for
disposal by the experts.
Cheers, Jenn

Hello, EvolDir community,
Our laboratory is currently developing protocols for the
use of two chemicals involved in capillary DNA frag-
ment analysis: formamide and acrylamide-based poly-
mer solutions (namely ABI POP-4).
I am hoping to ﬁnd out how labs generally treat this
waste. Do you collect it and manage it as hazardous
waste? Dispose of it in the trash? Have other collection
or abatement protocols?
As with the recent ethidium bromide postings, the
MSDS forms for acrylamide polymers and formamide
are not detailed with regard to the disposal of these
products.
Thanks in advance for your comments. I will post a
summary of responses in about a week.
Cheers, Jenn
—– At our lab we have decided to treat POP4-waste
as acrylamide-waste since we have not been able to ob-
tain a relevant datasheet from Applied Biosystems and
dont want to harm people or the environment. In Een-
mark this involve collection and managing as hazardouswaste.
—– I run a sequencing service at Edinburgh University
and we put the Hi-Di formamide and Pop-7 waste in
our yellow bin bags (for incineration I believe) along
with the ethidium agarose gel waste. We recently had
a health and safety visit and when they asked why I
wasn’t using the orange bags ( cheaper option for gen-
eral waste) I told them that I put the ethidium and
formamide waste in there and they seem satisﬁed with
that.
— I have dealt with formamide and acrylamide dis-
posal. A waste stream to the county hazardous
waste/special waste facility will likely be your best
course of action, but they do charge (overall, reasonably
priced). I’m not sure what is available in Placerville,
but there should be a facility that handles disposal of
household hazardous materials that might be able to
handle what you are generating.
— We just throw our formamide and polymer in the
trash - would be happy to know a better way if it is
recommended.
— This might be useful: http://-
www.ehs.berkeley.edu/pubs/guidelines/-
draindispgls.html#appendices It comes from our
EH&S website http://www.ehs.berkeley.edu/, which
has a lot of such information, although it’s often
diﬃcult to access.
— The criteria for a hazmat include toxicity, pH,
ﬂammability, and corrosovity. One UKy medschl lab
handles the polymerized acrylamide (APS+ temed +
acrylamide + urea + formamide) as trash, whereas the
unpolymerized acrylamide is hazardous waste. A UKy
bio lab handles all acrylamide as hazardous waste.
Liquids can be dumped down the drain if the pH is
between ca. 5 and 10; otherwise, the liquid is consid-
ered a hazardous waste, such as NaOH to clean the
acrylamide plates. Sometimes one chemical neutralizes
another so the resulting mixture can be dumped down
the drain. For example, Na2CO3 (30 gm/ L) and 10%
(v/v) glacial acetic acid) have a pH of 7.
— You’ll use around 100ul POP4 per run with a 16
capillary array. The spent polymer is ejected in c.15ml
water and we dispose of this down the sink (I generally
change buﬀers etc after 6 plates). We treat samples
in HIDI as toxic and use a specialised contractor for
disposal. Hope this helps you.
— i’m very interested in ﬁnding out what you have
heard... we tend to chuck our formamide-containing
plates in the trash and polymer/liquid wastes (buﬀer
and rinse waters) down the sink... but i doubt it’sJanuary 1, 2006 EvolDir 55
the right thing to do. but i also don’t foresee getting
our post-docs and grad students to pipette out old for-
mamide into a waste jar.

Hi,
I have a six month internship position from the “The
International Association for the Exchange of Students
for Technical Experience”
http://www.iaeste.org/network/index.html The posi-
tion will begin in April/May 2006, and will involve both
ﬂow cytometric analyses of apomictic (asexual repro-
duction through seed) seed production, and molecular
genetic analyses (microsatellite) of plants in the North
American genus Boechera (wild relative of Arabidop-
sis). I am looking for someone who has basic molecular
biology skills who also likes to work with computers,
since many of our analyses are automated. Knowledge
of German would be helpful, but is not required.
The candidate must be registered at a university, but
you should also contact your local IAESTE oﬃce for
more details on any restrictions (see above link).
The IPK is a large and well-endowed research center lo-
cated about 2 hours southwest of Berlin, in the foothills
of the beautiful Harz Mountains.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions, or would like to apply.

Hi all
Does anyone know of a freeware alternative to Gen-
eMapper? (Preferably windows but we could use linux)
We would like to open and examine microsatellite frag-
ments that have been run on an ABI and saved under
GeneMapper (.fsa).
We have insuﬃcient RAM to install GeneMapper on
our lab computer, we do have access to GeneScan but
the .fsa ﬁles will not open under this system (could
GeneMapper ﬁles be saved as Genescan ﬁles?).
Any suggestions would be gratefully received Thank

you to analyze .fsa ﬁles. You can download it for
free at their web site, http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/-

you’ve probably already got this from someone else but
just in case... This program converts the genescan ﬁles
to genotyper format in one very easy step.
http://dna.biotech.wisc.edu/ABRF/
Cheers Desiree
Yes, you can get a little program (i’ve saved it as
“ﬁle(s) togs” but i’m not sure what i found it as) that
does nothing other than to change your genemapper
ﬁles into ﬁles that genescan can read. after you’ve
analyzed the ﬁles in genescan, you can analyze them
without genemapper by using a program akin to genog-
rapher, which creates virtual gels from your genescan
analyzed fsa ﬁles. You can score the gels by hand, or
I believe you can also get a semi-automated analysis
by specifying which band lengths to include in the gel.
Less automated than GeneMapper, so not as good for
huge numbers of samples maybe, but it works. Hope
this helps, Beth
If you can ﬁnd a copies of the programs genescan and
genotyper, you can basically handle your .fsa ﬁles in
the same manner. These are not free, and ABI prob-
ably does not sell them anymore, however, if you can
get your hands on the programs they are just as good
as genemapper (less automated, which may be better
in many cases) and you will not run into problems with
insuﬃcient RAM.
Tom
we are using GeneMarker since a couple of weeks. It
isn’t free either and you’ll have to ask for the price
(http://www.softgenetics.com/gm/index.htm ), but it
turned out to be very usefull. It is working on Win-
dows platforms. I am doing fragment analysis and the
program can easily analyse .fsa ﬁles, including size
standard application and automatised allele calls. It is
kind of a combination of GeneScan and GeneMapper. Iam not aware of a free software that has similar power.
Good luck with the analysis,
Tobias
.fsa ﬁles are general ﬁles that are generated by genescan.
They can be read by genemapper and analysed, but also
by genotyper (the older version of genemapper). There
will be more versions from genotyper around (although
it is not freeware, but look at the ABI site, they might
some free versions).
Good luck!
Kees van Oers
Try Genemarker www.softgenetics.com <http://-
www.softgenetics.com/ >- there is a demo copy that
you can download and use for free (but you can’t
properly save your data ﬁles - though I managed to
get round this by copying the text ﬁles into excel) and
you can ask for a free 30-day trial version too.
We ﬁnd it easier to use than genemapper when trying
to develop and score new markers,
Best wishes, Sara
we used “strand”. It is not perfect but it works. There
are other programms I did not try. good luck Anne
Yes! I use the excellent and freely available programme
STRand http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/informatics/-
STRand/ Dr S Rendell
If you want to analyse samples in Genescan and not
Genemapper don’t analyse your data in Genemapper at
all. Take raw data from ABI and analyse it in Genes-
can.
After analysing in Genscan you can do the allel scor-
ing in the same program (msat electropherograms
are relatively simple). If you have a lot of sam-
ples/loci you could try using Genographer. Genogra-
pher is free AFLP software available on line: http://-

Genotyper InstallationJanuary 1, 2006 EvolDir 57
I am trying to install Genotyper on a new PC computer

Genotyper answer
Thank you all for your suggestions regarding installa-
tion of Genotyper. I will not copy all comments into
this message. Apparently Genotyper was not designed
to run on machines with a lot of memory. I tried
the following suggestion from Melanie - because it was
counter-intuitive to the error message and I had ex-
plored the more intuitive approaches. It worked ﬁrst
time on my desktop XP Professional 1 GB RAM and
on my laptop XP Home 1GB RAM.
Richard, here is the ﬁx that worked for me. It was sent
to me from ABI tech support.
-Melanie Paquin
Hello,
First, the Genotyper software was never tested on the
Windows XP operating system, so you may run into
problems trying to run the software. The error that you
are getting is similar to an error that some customers re-
ceived on the Windows 2000 operating system. I know
that the error states that there is Insuﬃcient memory,
but the ﬁx is actually to reduce the amount of virtual
memory on your computer. Here is something that you
can try:
Go to Control Panel >System >Advanced tab >in
the Performance Options pane, select Settings >select
the Advanced tab >in the Virtual Memory pane, select
“Change...” >Select the customize radio button >set
initial size to 500 >set maximum size to 700. If this
does not work, select the “no paging ﬁle” radio button.
I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have
any questions.

Haplotype diversity
Other:
I would like to hear your opinion concerning the estima-
tion of haplotype diversity for nuclear sequences. When
there are sequences with more than one heterozygous
position, one cannot tell which are the two alleles (there
will have to be ambiguous positions). In this case, how
can we calculate haplotype diversities? Is it possible or
not?
Another issue is how to build a ﬁles to infer phyloge-
netic relationships. Shall we include two sequences per
individual (two identical sequences in the case of ho-
mozygous, two sequences with one diﬀerent position in
the case of one heterozygous position and two identical
sequences with ambiguity codes in the case of individ-
uals with more that one heterozygous position)?

Answers: 1)
dear vera
you have to distinguish between phylogenetics and pop-
ulation genetics. The ﬁrst deals with ﬁxed susbtitutions
between species and the latter with intra-species diver-
sity. I would suggest to drop polymorphic positions
when doing phylogenetic analysis.
There are methods to infer haplotypes from sequence
diversity (look for Stephens et al. PHASE). Alterna-
tively you might want to resolve the haplotypes by
ARMS PCR, cloning or something of the sort, which
would be more precise.
Hope I was helpful

2) Dear Vera,
You may circumvent this problem by a) cloning your
PCR-products or b) calculate the two most likely haplo-
types from your genotype (see e.g. Excoﬃer and Slatkin
1995 on this topic).
We would otherwise like to have a copy or your incom-

Vera,
Have you considered using algorithms to phase hap-lotypes from nuclear sequence data that has multiple
polymorphisms (such as the program PHASE ( http:/-
/www.stat.washington.edu/stephens/software.html )?
Dave
4)
You can ﬁrst obtain estimates of haplotype frequen-
cies by maximizing the likelihood. Then you can use
those frequencies to compute your diversity score. De-
pending on the number of polymorphic sites in your se-
quence, for haplotype estimation you can use an EM al-
gorithm (for relatively small numbers of sites), or some-
thing like the PHASE program (for larger numbers of
sites). There are also other alternatives. There is a
fair amount of software out there that you can use to
obtain the MLE estimates of haplotype frequencies. Of
course, it is all academic software, but at least it is free.

Oi Vera,
it is a tricky thing to infer haplotype phase. One way
to circumvent the estimation procedure is to clone your
amplicons and sequence them separately. The Topo-
TA kit is really fast. Another way is to treat your het-
erozygous sites as SNPs and do a phase estimation, as it
is done in multi-allelic systems (SNPs, microsatellites,
MHC/SI alleles, etc.). However, the problem here is
that what you would consider to be SNPs are not real
SNPs, because they are physically linked.
Several Bayesian, ML, and coalsecent algorithms have
been developed from 1990.

Invasion papers
Dear Colleagues,
I am currently writing a review paper on genetic vari-
ation of invasive populations in their native (source)
range. I am ﬁnding that there is a general lack of pa-
pers on the topic. I am interested in papers that fo-
cus on genetic variation of phenotypic traits that are
relevant for invasive success (that aﬀect ﬁtness in the
invaded range). I am not interested in genetic variation
of putatively neutral markers, as I am focusing on cases
where selection might occur.
I will deal only with systems where the particular geo-
graphic source of the invaded population is known (us-
ing molecular markers, rather than loosely inferred fromdistributional data). Cases where the selection regime
acting on the trait of interest in the source range is
well-characterized would be ideal.

Mythological gene names
Dear All A colleague in the Arts faculty at Notting-
ham University who organizing a conference on Medea
has asked me if I know of any genes (other than Medea
in Tribolium) named after greek mythological charac-
ters, and if so what inspired the naming. I can think
of relatively few: - Odysseus in fruit ﬂies - a speciation
gene - Caronte In chickens (Spanish for Charon, the
ferryman of Hades), which was, I understand, directly
inspired by the myths. - Argonaut - genes involved in
post-transcriptional gene silencing. - Callipyge in sheep
comes from Greek but isn’t to do with myths I think -
it just means lovely buttocks.
So the question is are there many others and does any-
one know the story of how the genes got their names?
All anecdotes greatly appreciated.

PCRmachines MJR
Some news and a question about PCR machines for the
group....
Like many labs, we use MJR thermal cyclers for PCR
and have been quite happy with them. Our Dyad ma-
chine has gone on the fritz and needs repair. When I
called Bio-rad, which acquired MJR earlier this year,
they told me that they cannot service any MJR ma-
chine because of a court order permanently enjoin-
ing them from selling or supporting MJR machines in
the U.S. The order is due to successful legal action
by ABI/Applera against MJR for patent infringement.
Bio-rad1s materials state that they have tried to ne-
gotiate a settlement with ABI, but ABI has shown no
interest in reaching an agreement. Bio-rad says they
are continuing their eﬀorts, but there is no timetable
for when service might resume on MJR cyclers in the
U.S. (see www.bio-rad.com/LifeScience/pdf/letter.pdf )
This puts us and probably a growing number of U.S.
labs as time passes in a diﬃcult position, with an ex-
pensive and eﬀectively worthless machine in our hands.
Bio-rad is honoring warrantees and service contracts
on MJR instruments by providing loaners of their own
3Icycler2PCR machines until the warrantee/contractruns out. They will also provide a3generous2trade-in
on MJR machines requiring repair for those wanting to
buy a new Icycler machine.
Does anyone have experience with the Icycler? I would
appreciate hearing any testimonials about its perfor-
mance and reliability.

Positive selection
Howdy,
I’m doing some analysis to test for positive selection in a
protein-coding gene. However, I’m not sure about how
to calculate the codon frequencies. Given that there
are several possible alternatives (e.g. to calculate them

Rare mutation abundance
Evoldir,
I just received a query from a colleague (below). I have
made some replies, but since I am not a population ge-
neticist, I told him I would post the query to evoldir in
hopes of getting comments from experts. Bottom line
is that his intuition is that neutral evolution shouldn’t
result in so many rare mutations - even given a recent
bottleneck.
The query:
As you know from the review there are at least nine ex-
ceedingly rare dominant mutations in Antioquia which
has a population of 8 million people. For geographic
reasons the population is considered an isolate or more
accurately an admixture that was subsequently iso-
lated. The population derives mainly from Amerind
females and Spanish males based on mitochondrial and
Y chromosome markers. About 400 years ago, both
groups went through a severe bottleneck based on the
low diversity in the markers. We could make estimates
of the size of the founder population, perhaps several
thousand would be a very generous estimate. After
the founding there was some continued gene ﬂow from
Spanish males who continued to arrive. Families in the
region typically have 10-15 children.
All the genetic isolates I am aware of have excess re-
cessive mutations for the most part due to drift, and
although many genetic isolates are well studied, I do
not know of reports in which there are many domi-
nant diseases. We are unaware of very many recessive
diseases in Antioquia, but this absence of information
cannot be considered data.
In particular, I’m interested in the following questions:
(1) How can one quantify the greatest number of ex-
pected dominant mutations, assuming neutrality, and
given population parameters above.
(2) What size population under what mating circum-
stances would be needed to predict the occurrence of
nine dominant mutations that world wide have gene
frequencies on the order of one in a million?
(3) Are there features of an admixture, in contrast to
a strict genetic isolate, that might predispose to this
pattern of dominant mutations?
Thanks for any thoughts. As is the ﬁne EvolDir cus-tom, I can make a compendium of replies if folks have
interest.

Reduced micro variance
Dear colleagues,
Reduction variance in microsatellite alleles ﬂanking
coding region may be an indicator for associated vari-
ation reduction in the coding region. Schloetterer and
his coleagues developed indices (lnRV and lnRH) to
compare microsatellite alleles variation between popu-
lations. These indices can hint for signiﬁcant reduction
in variation in one of the populations if the index ex-
ceed a certain value. However, there is no correction
for multiple comparisons, except Bonﬀeroni correction
to the P value. In case of many loci (above 50), Bonf-
feroni correction may create very small threshold that
will mask “real” diﬀerences. I wonder if there is any
program that can calculate signiﬁcance of reduction in
variation in microsatellite markers, taking into account
multiple comparisons. I have around 150 individuals,
genotyped for ~60 loci, distributed in 17 chromosomes
(i.e., some are dependent). Any advice will be appreci-
ated.

SSE election
Dear SSE Members,
This is a reminder to VOTE ONLINE for SSE oﬃcers
by December 31. I am sorry to say to date we currentlyJanuary 1, 2006 EvolDir 63
have a voter “turnout” of about 6%, making us look
pretty bad compared, say, to the recent voter turnout
in Iraq. It is not even as good as SSE voting in the past
using paper ballots. Printing and mailing paper ballots
costs SSE about $3500/year, and it would be nice if we
were able to avoid that expense by using online voting;
online voting also allows members with electronic only
membership to vote (this was not possible with paper
ballots).
Below are the instructions for voting–please do it while
you’re thinking about it! Thanks very much for your
participation in this important matter for the Society
for the Study of Evolution.
Jessica Gurevitch
Executive Vice President
———-
Dear Members of the Society for the Study of Evolu-
tion,
Voting for Society oﬃcers this year will be online only.
To vote, go to www.evolutionsociety.org and click on
member secure login. Your login ID and password are
the same as those used to access the journal online, and
are on your Journal mailing label. If you do not remem-
ber your userid or password, there is a place to enter
your e-mail address after clicking member secure login;
if your e-mail address matches the one in the database,
this information will be sent to you automatically.
The deadline for voting is December 31, 2005.
Be sure to vote for TWO Council members, and of
course one of each for all of the other oﬃces.
You will notice when you go to the online secure site
that a number of useful features have been added with
secure access only by members: substantial publisher
discounts from Oxford University Press and Sinauer
Associates, both prominent publishers of books on evo-
lutionary biology, and a membership directory for SSE.
And while you are thinking evolution thoughts, a web-
site for the 2006 Evolution meetings at Stony Brook
University is now online (although many details remain
to be posted)–you might want to sneak a peek at http:/-
/stonybrook.edu/sse2006 as you think about plans to
attend what should be a very exciting meeting. And
do take a look around the SSE website while you’re
there–we keep adding new resources and material to
the site.

Scientiﬁc content in Dover Decision
Hi Brian-
As I’m sure you know, the US District Court ruled
against teaching Intelligent Design yesterday. While
much of the media coverage has focused on the U.S. le-
gal principles involved, there’s a fair bit of science in the
opinion (pages 64-90 of the opinion, link below). For
instance, in addition to discussion about whether or not
ID really is science and aspects of hypothesis testing,
publication with peer review, and so on, there’s also
some discussion of Type III secretion systems, exapta-
tions, genetic recombination, and homology.
I think the science-related portions of the opinion might
be of interest to members of the EvolDir list, but I’ll
also understand if you’re cautious about turning the
list into a discussion forum for teaching of evolution in
public education.

Sequencing Buﬀer Recipe answers
Hello:
Thank you to all the people who responded to my re-
quest for a recipe for 5X sequencing dilution buﬀer to
use with BigDye. Most people use 400 mM Tris (pH
9.0), 10 mM MgCl2, and apparently that’s what’s on
the package insert from ABI. Storage conditions varied64 EvolDir January 1, 2006
from -20 to room temperature.
Some people were wondering what I meant by 1/16th
reactions - we use 0.5 ul BD in 10 - 15 ul volume re-
actions, depending on the template concentration. The
BigDye mix is 2.5X and the sequencing buﬀer is 5X,
so the formula we use to determine how much buﬀer is
((vol of rxn)/2.5)-0.5)/2. We’ve had success with this
approach for both PCR products and plasmids on our
3100 (with the ABI buﬀer). If anyone is interested in
template amounts or other details, feel free to contact
me.
Thanks and happy sequencing!
Cheers, Leslie Turner

I thought it might be helpful to pass on this convenient
protocol for making up sequencing buﬀer, courtesy of
Brian Caudle. Again, this was the most commonly sug-
gested recipe. I’ve copied the recipes that diﬀered from
this one below.
Cheers, Leslie Turner
5X Sequencing Buﬀer: 400 mM Tris HCl (pH 9.0) 10
mM MgCl2
For a 50 ml solution of 5X buﬀer: 10 ml 2M Tris HCl
500 ul 1M MgCl2 39.5 ml ddH2O
Filter using a 0.2 um ﬁlter. (I use syringe ﬁlters, that
way when I am done mixing the solution, I can ﬁlter
and aliquot in the same action)
Alternatively, if you don’t have these particular concen-
trations of solutions, here is another mixture:
For a 50 ml solution of 5X buﬀer (alt): 20 ml 1 M Tris
HCl 20 mL 25 mM MgCl2 10 ml ddH2O
I hope this helps you out, and good luck.

*********
Here is the dilution buﬀer recipe I got from a sequenc-
ing center manager several years ago, and it has worked
beautifully. I also ﬁnd it works well with ET chemistry
as well as BigDye. My only caveat is that I have not
used it with the more recent BigDye chemistry modiﬁ-cations but I suspect that won’t make any dﬀerence.
5 mM MgCl2 (5 uL of 1M MgCl2 from Sigma per 1 mL
buﬀer)
0.2 M Tris HCl (pH 9.0) (200 uL of 1M stock per 1 mL
buﬀer)
Add deionized water to 1 mL volume.
I was advised to purchase MgCl2 as a 1M solution, as
powdered MgCl2 is hygroscopic and the “true” molecu-
lar weight can deviate from the calculated value. Also,
the little tubes of MgCl2 that come with PCR buﬀers
can vary considerably in their true concentration. To
avoid potential problems, I have followed this advice.
Cheers,
David Remington

Are you familiar with HalfBD? I think it’s what you’re
asking for and, though not free, is far cheaper than the
ABI alternative. It works as advertised in our hands.

We always run out of Big Dye buﬀer, so we use the

5mM MgCl2
Add 20 (or 10) ml 1M Tris and .5ml 1M MgCl2 to sterile
water for a ﬁnal
volume of 100 mls.
Hope this helps.

Shortest sequenceDear colleagues
I have a mathematical idea which I would like to apply
to a gene nucleotide sequence:
1. Which is the shortest complete gene sequence to
be found with and without mutations (not necessarily
human)?
2. Was the p53 human wildtype sequence available on
databases derived from a single person?

Software SubstitutionalAsymmetry
Under the neutral model of protein evolution, a com-
parison of sequences from two species should show equal
numbers of substitutions in each direction for each
pair of amino acids. For example, when comparing
the mesophile (moderate habitat temperature) Bacil-
lus subtilis with the thermophile (high habitat temper-
ature) Geobacillus stearothermophilus, you would ex-
pect the number of sites with lysine in B. subtilis and
arginine in G. stearothermophilus to equal the number
of sites with arginine in B. subtilis and lysine in G.
stearothermophilus. In fact, a data set of 229 proteins
showed 412 aligned sites with the ﬁrst pattern and only
157 sites with the second pattern. This “substitutional
asymmetry” suggests that arginine is preferred by nat-
ural selection over lysine in G. stearothermophilus (Mc-
Donald et al. 1999, Mol. Biol. Evol. 16: 1785-1790).
I am now making available three programs (Am-
biguityRemover, AsymmetryCounter and Asymme-
tryScaler) that will enable users to analyze sets of
aligned protein sequences for substitutional asymme-
try. The programs are available for Windows or Mac
OS X, and the Pascal source code is available and
could easily be compiled for other operating systems.January 1, 2006 EvolDir 67

Used 230V Thermocyclers
Greetings,
Our lab is in the process of organizing a genetics work-
ship at the University of Asmara in Eritrea. We would
like to provide our colleagues there with the basic equip-
ment necessary for a molecular genetics laboratory.
However, we need equipment that utilizes 230v 50H
electricity. We are wondering if anyone would be willing
to sell (or donate!) to us either a functional thermocy-
cler or microcentrifuge which they are no longer using.
The only speciﬁcation that we require is the microcen-
trifuge must reach a speed of 15,000g. Alternatively, if
anyone has a source through which we can ﬁnd quality
used equipment that runs on 230v, please inform us.
Thank you very much for your help.

Analysis of the newly sequenced Paramecium tetraure-
lia genome revealed a recent Whole Genome Duplica-
tion (WGD). Among the 40,000 annotated genes, more
than 12,000 pairs of paralogs from the WGD are still
present in the genome, accounting for 60% of present
day Paramecium genes. Our research project is to take
advantage of this exceptional situation to study the fate
of genes following a WGD: gene conversion, neo- or sub-
functionalisation, formation of pseudogenes, gene loss,
etc. An important part of the project is an analysis of
the Paramecium transcriptome, with particular atten-
tion to the expression of the pairs of paralogous genes.
We are looking for a post-doctoral candidate interested
in the problem of genome evolution and with good expe-
rience in bioinformatics, in particular as applied to the
analysis of DNA microarrays. The post-doc will help
design olignucleotide microarrays for optimal discrimi-
nation of the pairs of paralogous genes and conduct the
statistical analysis of hybridizations with cDNAs from
various cellular states, with the objective of describing
the evolution of diﬀerent categories of duplicated genes.

“Quantitative- and molecular genetic characterization
and evaluation of animal genetic resources”
Two year post doc position at the Institute of Animal
Breeding, Department of Animal Breeding and Genetic
Resources
Genetic diversity in farm animal species is the basic re-
quirement in animal breeding to meet future breeding
goals, but has been lost in the past at an increasing rate.
Improvement of our insight into mechanisms underly-
ing genetic diversity will assist in the reconstructionof domestication events, determination of genetic re-
lationships between populations, assessment of genetic
variation within populations, development of a strat-
egy to manage and conserve genetic diversity, and may
indicate possible consequences of intensive selection in
a decreasing number of populations and lines used in
farm animal species. The research is aimed at the de-
velopment and implementation of sophisticated quan-
tative genetic methods using molecular information in
this ﬁeld. In our on-going collaborative research activ-
ities we have assessed a wide ranged gene pool in the
chicken by typing more than 70 breeds at microsatel-
lite locii from all over the world. In addition, molec-

Orsay Bioinformatics
BIOINFORMATICS - POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
IN ORSAY (FRANCE)
A postdoctoral contract founded by the French “Na-70 EvolDir January 1, 2006
tional Research Agency ANR” is available from Jan-
uary 2006 to develop a research project supervised by
David Moreira, in the “Microbial diversity and evo-
lution” team in the University of Paris-Sud at Or-
say ( http://www.ese.u-psud.fr/microbiologie/ ), which
is located 25 km south from Paris, 30 min by direct
train.
The project concerns the phylogenomic analysis of a
large number of proteins involved in the construction
of several eukaryotic multi-molecular complexes (cen-
trosomes, telomeres, splicing complex, etc), which can-
not be found in prokaryotes as complex structures, even
if the homologous proteins exist. The aim will be to
get insight into the origin and evolution of the diﬀerent
proteins. The comparison of the genomic context may
help to discover new proteins involved in these multi-
molecular complexes. The project envisages the con-
struction of a data base containing sequence, genomic,
and phylogenetic information.
The contract can be renewed up to three years. The
salary will be of ~1800 euros (including medical assis-
tance).
We are seeking motivate candidates with good experi-
ence in bioinformatics, especially in sequence data base
construction and management and phylogenetic and ge-
nomic analysis. Knowledge of current programming
languages will be necessary.
Interested candidates can send a CV and the names of
scientists that we can ask for letters of support to:

One or more postgraduate research positions are avail-72 EvolDir January 1, 2006
able for a highly motivated individuals to join an NSF-
funded research project to study the evolution of a
tritrophic interaction. The primary objective is to test
the working hypothesis that the indirect eﬀects of the
glandular trichomes of Datura wrightii on the natural
enemies of D. wrightii’s herbivores oppose the direct
eﬀects of the trichomes on those herbivores. These
indirect eﬀects may constrain the increase in the fre-
quency of plants with glandular trichomes in natural
populations compared to the frequency of plants with
nonglandular trichomes. One project will focus upon
measurements of the ﬁtness of plants in the ﬁeld in the
presence and absence of herbivores and/or natural en-
emies. A second project will focus upon the behaviors
of various natural enemy species on herbivore-damaged
and undamaged plants that also diﬀer in trichome mor-
phology. The successful candidate(s) will participate in
ongoing ﬁeld and laboratory experiments and also will
have the opportunity to develop related projects.
Applicants must have a PhD. degree before hiring, and
research experience and knowledge in insect ecology
and behavior, the design and analysis of ﬁeld experi-
ments, insect identiﬁcation and a genuine interest in the
evolution and maintenance of tritrophic interactions.
Excellent oral and verbal communication skills are also
required.
Applicants should send a curriculum vitae, relevant
reprints or manuscripts in press, a description of re-
search interests within the Datura system, and the
names and e-mail and postal addresses of three refer-
ences to:

The Bologna Winter Schools are unique international
forums where to debate the state of the art of complex
problems at the forehand of Bioinformatics, Compu-
tational Biology and Modern Biology. The 7th Edition
focuses on the applications of Bioinformatics to the Hu-
man Genome Analysis. Fundamental problems, that
are still matter of debate, will be addressed such as the
annotation, the expression and the regulation of the
Human Genome, the relationship between expression
and diseases, the variability between populations and
the applications to molecular medicine. The growing
interest in Biodiversity, Aging, Forensic Genomics andearly diagnosis of genetic maladies indicates how Bioin-
formatics is essential not only for the management and
the analysis of the data but also for identifying typ-
ical markers of diﬀerent populations and individuals,
with the common goal of highlighting the relationship
between genotype and phenotype. The school will be
devoted to explore which ideas and tools out of Bioin-
formatics can eﬀectively help in the analysis at large of
the Human Genome and will cover diﬀerent sessions:

ULAR ECOLOGY Friday Harbor Labs, NW Washing-
ton State Spring Quarter 2006 (27 March - 3 June
2006, 15 credits) Apply by 16 January 2006 http:/-
/depts.washington.edu/fhl/ Live and do research for
10 weeks at beautiful Friday Harbor Laboratories, the
world-renowned University of Washington marine lab
on San Juan Island, 75 miles northwest of Seattle. In-
tensive research training experience in a small class.
$3000 stipend provided to all admitted students. Ap-
plicants do not need to be currently enrolled at a uni-
versity.
In this apprenticeship, students will use DNA mark-
ers to explore the ecology, evolution and conservation
of marine organisms. Research questions we tackle in-
clude studies on gene ﬂow, systematics, larval ecology,and species identiﬁcation. During the ﬁrst two weeks
of the apprenticeship, a series of lectures and labo-
ratory exercises will provide an overview of the prin-
ciples, tools and techniques that are commonly em-
ployed in molecular ecology, with an emphasis on fer-
tilization ecology and invertebrate life histories. After
this introduction, apprentices will develop and pursue
research projects of their choosing; from design, ﬁeld
sampling and labwork to analysis and scientiﬁc data
presentation. Projects from past classes can be viewed
athttp://web.pdx.edu/ ˜ biermann/MME/ . Appren-
tices will emerge with skills in PCR, DNA sequenc-
ing and fragment analysis, and an appreciation for the
possibilities and pitfalls of applying molecular meth-
ods in marine biology and ecology. Enrollment lim-
ited to 8 students. Contact: jessica.marks@bio.uib.no

UHelsinki PopDynamics Apr-May
Graduate course on the DYNAMICS OF STRUC-
TURED POPULATIONS at the University of Helsinki,
April-May 2006
In late spring 2006, Professor Mats Gyllenberg will give
a course on modelling and the dynamics of general phys-
iologically structured populations. The course starts
with an account of the basic principles of modelling
structured populations and will in the end bring the
audience to the research frontier of the ﬁeld of math-
ematical population theory. Topics include existence
and uniqueness of solutions, steady-state analysis, sta-
bility and bifurcation theory, and adaptive dynamics.
Prerequisites for the course are a solid background in
undergraduate mathematics (analysis, linear algebra,
probability) and a genuine interest in biology.
The course starts on April 3 and ends on May 5, 2006.
There will be 8 hours of lectures per week. Graduate
as well as advanced undergraduate students and young
researchers from other universities are welcome and can
join the course free of charge; we however cannot pro-
vide ﬁnancial assistance for travel and subsistence.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
