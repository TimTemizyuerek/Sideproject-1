parative Phylogeography* Organizers: John C. Avise,
Brian W. Bowen and Francisco J. Ayala
Beckman Center of the National Academies, Irvine, CA
In recent decades, phylogeographic thought has bridged
and thereby enriched the elds of population genet-
ics, phylogenetics, and conservation biology. Phylogeo-
graphic perspectives emphasize a genealogical approach
to intraspecic evolution and have had transformative
impacts on population biology, biogeography, systemat-
ics, ecology, genetics, and biodiversity assessment.
This Colloquium will be the tenth and nal installment
in what has been a series of annual symposia under the
umbrella title In the Light of Evolution (ILE). ILE-X
will survey the current state of phylogeographic thinking
in the ecological and evolutionary sciences and bring
together leading scientists representing the best of what
phylogeography can oer biology writ large.

Orlando Genetics Jul13-17
The Allied Genetics Conference (TAGC) will include a
new meeting on Population, Evolutionary and Quanti-
tative Genetics organized by Mike Lynch
Although most of the central venues of TAGC revolve
around the long-standing model-organism meetings, the
broad and overlapping elds of population, evolutionary,
and quantitative (PEQ) genetics span these systems
and more. Thus, in the interest of developing a fully
comprehensive genetics conference, the Genetics Society
of America (GSA) will also convene the rst joint meet-
ing for researchers in the latter elds. Topics will range
from population genomics to molecular evolution to the
dissection of the determinants of quantitative-trait vari-
ation, with equal emphasis placed on both model and
non-model organisms across the Tree of Life. PEQ has
a long history of both applied and theoretical research,
and both will be an integral part of this meeting.
The intention here is to promote a strong cross-
disciplinary network of colleagues performing both the-
oretical and empirical work. The meeting will consist of6 EvolDir December 1, 2015
a series of short talks, poster sessions, and plenary talks,
and will be dovetailed with the model-organism venues
to facilitate maximum interaction among those with sim-
ilar conceptual interests. As many as 90 oral presenta-
tions will be delivered directly in the PEQ meeting, with
dozens to hundreds of others with direct connections
being given in the other model-organism sub-meetings.
Time in the schedule will be set aside for the usual
GSA-sponsored career-development workshops, includ-
ing education-oriented, grant-writing, and networking
sessions focused on strategies for building successful
teaching methodologies and lasting collaborations.
GSA plans for PEQ to become the premier, regular
gathering of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars,
and established scientists in these central areas of genet-
ics, ideally being established as another of the several
periodic meetings sponsored and managed by the GSA.
After nearly 100 years of research in population, evolu-
tionary, and quantitative genetics, the time for holding
such an exciting meeting is long overdue.
These topics will be featured at the conference and
speakers will be selected from submitted abstracts in
the following areas:
Population Genomics Experimental Evolution Genome
Evolution Quantitative Traits Ecological Evolution
Adaptation and Speciation Molecular Evolution

Molecules as documents of evolutionary history: 50
years after - Rosco, Brittany, France.
May 9-13 2015
It is with the popularization of molecular tools and the
disclosure of genome sequences that evolutionary models
have become decisive in biology, in part because this
information is simply so abundant and so complex that
only a comparative method could reveal its meaning.
In 2016, it will be 50 years that Emile Zuckerkandl
and Linus Pauling have laid the foundation of molec-
ular phylogeny, and molecular evolution in general, in
their seminal article entitled \Molecules as documents
of evolutionary history". The fundamental realization
of this article was that DNA does not only encode the
elementary functional elements of an organisms, it also
harbours abundant information on the evolutionary his-
tory and life history traits of its ancestors.
The modelling of the evolutionary processes that gener-
ated extent genomes should reveal together the patterns
of the diversication of life, the processes by which evo-
lution proceeds at the molecular level, and how both are
aected by external conditions. Our challenge today,
as evolutionary biologists, is to bridge the gap between
species ecology, life history traits, population dynamics,
species phylogeny, gene phylogeny, genome structure,
gene network and molecular mechanisms.
The recent years have seen tremendous developments in
this direction, which we will attempt to review in this
conference.

AdmixedPopulations May18-20
Conference Announcement: SMBE Satellite Meeting on
the Genetics of Admixed Populations
May 18-20, 2016
San Antonio TX
Studies of admixed populations and the admixture pro-
cess touch on topics central to evolutionary and molec-
ular biology, including the dynamics of gene ow and
hybridization, population expansions, and adaptation.
Admixed populations have been leveraged to detect dis-
ease and phenotypic associations, elucidate mechanisms
and timescales of speciation, and infer regions under
selection. Acting as a natural experiment, admixed
populations provide insight into unique adaptations of
their parental populations, and evolutionary processes
in related populations more generally. Admixture is also
intimately linked with the recombination process, which
shues segments of dierent ancestry, and is proven to
vary in rate and location based on ancestry.
The primary goal of this satellite meeting is to emphasize
the common theoretical and empirical underpinnings
of the study of admixed human populations with the
study of hybridization in other animals and even plants,
opening up methods and study design from a specicDecember 1, 2015 EvolDir 9
organism to a wider audience. We hope to bridge theo-
retical and data-driven approaches, starting a discussion
on the suitability of methods to various systems and
open questions that may be better resolved using an
interdisciplinary approach, as well as considering ethical
concerns associated with these studies.
Workshop sessions include:
Admixture as a dynamic process Novel Methods to
Untangle Admixture Empirical Studies of Population
History Admixture as a Mechanism for and Against
Speciation Admixture and Selection: Phenotypic and
Medical Implications Panel Discussion: Ethical consid-
erations and Sampling Schemes

FuturePhyProposalRequest Feb20
*FuturePhyjOpenTreejArbor* *Request for Work-
shop Proposals: Clade Focused Tree-Data Integration
Challenges*
*RFP:* 2 page proposals to fund small workshops and/or
hackathons on completing the tree of life and integrating
data layers for specic clades. *Proposal Deadline Ex-
tended to:* Nov. 15, 2015 *Meeting dates:* Feb 20-23,
2016 *Location:* Gainesville, University of Florida *Par-
ticipants per workshop:* 10 maximum funded (virtual at-
tendees possible) *Contacts:* mwestneat@uchicago.edu(FuturePhy), karen.cranston@gmail.com (OpenTree),
lukejharmon@gmail.com (Arbor)
The challenges to completing the Tree of Life and inte-
grating data layers (NSF GoLife goals) are huge and vary
across clades. Some groups have a nearly-complete tree
but lack publicly available data layers, whereas other
groups lack phylogenetic resolution or the resources to
support tree / data integration. Partnering with Open
Tree of Life and Arbor Workows, FuturePhy will sup-
port a series of clade-based workshops to identify and
solve specic challenges in tree of life synthesis and data
layer integration.
Proposals should focus on challenges in completing the
tree of life and integrating data layers for a clade or
clades of interest. Cross-fertilization among systematists
and other elds is desired, with focus on phylogenetic
challenges, data layer development, and/or tree-data
integration and analyses. How can developers of Ar-
bor, OpenTree and other resources develop tools to help
solve these challenges? What tools and infrastructure
are needed for others to solve similar problems?
Proposals (using the *proposal template*
< https://docs.google.com/document/d/-
1SJbzT2h1oPGOCGDsETfPjAI8ZKDhrgIS9odZPuxySPw/-
edit>) should include (1) the status of the phylogeny
for your group, including availability of trees in Dryad,
TreeBASE or Open Tree of Life, (2) target data
layers for the workshops, indicating the locations and
accessibility of the data, (3) key biological questions
that you would like to ask, given availability of trees and
data layers, (4) roadmap to tangible products, with a
clear timeline, (5) the challenges to phylogeny and data
synthesis in your clade, with specic targets scoped for
progress towards a solution during the workshop, (6)
evidence that public data exist as a starting point or
access to data that can be made public.
*General plans & logistics.* Each workshop may involve
up to 10 funded attending participants, with the rst
set of workshops to happen in parallel at the same time
and location. Open Tree of Life, FuturePhy and Arbor
personnel will be there to demo, discuss and plan im-
plementation. Each group should involve participants
familiar with data analysis / integration / use of web
services (e.g., in R, python). Groups can focus anywhere
on the spectrum of completing phylogeny to integrating
data layers. Groups agree to make assembled data or
tools publicly available and to provide a post-workshop
report after the event. Phylogenetic data will be incor-
porated into Open Tree of Life.
*Evaluation.* Proposals will be evaluated on (1) the
feasibility of solving the specic challenges, including
evidence for publicly-available data; (2) participant di-10 EvolDir December 1, 2015
versity (discipline, career stages, gender, ethnicity), (3)
participant expertise, (4) how solving these challenges
will benet researchers in other clades, (5) potential for
increasing public data, tools, products, and contributing
trees to Open Tree of Life and related initiatives.

PhD positions in animal palaeogenomics and epige-
nomics at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA
(ACAD), Adelaide, Australia
We are currently conducting a number of projects inves-
tigating the genomic evolution of large mammals during
periods of rapid environmental change occurring dur-
ing the late Pleistocene and the Holocene (supported
by Australian Research Council grants DP140104233,
LP130100646, and FL140100260). Key aims of these
projects are to:
- Resolve the evolutionary history of living and ex-
tinct megafaunal species - Characterise demographic
responses of animal populations to past environmental
change - Explore hybridisation, extinction and specia-
tion events to better understand how ancestral genetic
diversity is distributed among surviving populations -
Study the process of selection through time at the ge-
nomic scale, and investigate relationships between the
strength and direction of selection and environmental
variables - Examine the role that epigenetic modica-
tions play in facilitating rapid adaptation to environ-
mental changes
Study species include a range of mammals, predom-
inantly ungulates and carnivorans, for which ACAD
already possesses a large collection of sub-fossil material.
In addition, there is scope within these projects for col-
lecting new specimens from museums and directly from
the eld. For example, we recently collected deep-frozen
bison bones from Canadian gold mines to complementour existing collection of bovid specimens. See blog

ANR-FWF PROJET: SUZUKILL Job description
We are looking for a PhD candidate to work, from early
March 2016, on an international project (SUZUKILL)
funded by the French Research National Agency (ANR)
and Austrian Science Fund (FWF). The project, pri-
marily in the eld of applied entomology, is multi-
disciplinary involving collaborations among UE partners:
University of Rennes 1 (UMR CNRS 6553 ECOBIO,
France), University of Lyon 1 (UMR CNRS 5558 LBBE,
France), University of Natural Resources and Life Sci-
ences (IFFF, BOKU, Austria), and Insect Pest Control
Laboratory (IPCL, Austria) from the Joint FAO/IAEADecember 1, 2015 EvolDir 13
Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food & Agriculture.
Short ^Adescription The recent invasion of fruit pro-
duction areas by the Spotted Wing Drosophila y,
Drosophila suzukii, is a major concern for Europe's soft
fruit production sector. So far, little is known about the
ability of D. suzukii to withstand winter low tempera-
ture stress, but laboratory experiments (on Japanese's
populations) suggest that D. suzukii is relatively cold-
intolerant. Cold tolerance of European populations is
currently unknown and such knowledge is necessary to
establish appropriate control measures. In addition,
the mechanisms by which D. suzukii modulate thermo-
tolerance in response to environmental variables are
poorly understood. Our objective is to gain fundamen-
tal knowledge on the genetic and plastic bases of ther-
mal plasticity of European D. suzukii populations and
analyse physiological mechanisms underlying thermal
tolerance.
Objective of present PhD and specic skills required The
present PhD (3 years) will focus on thermal tolerance
of Drosophila suzukii (mainly cold). The candidate will
be based in France at the University of Rennes 1 (UMR
CNRS 6553 ECOBIO). The experiments will involve
thermal assays associated with system-wide Omics ap-
proaches and will use a combination of disciplines rang-
ing from genetics to molecular biology and biochemistry.
The candidate should have expertise in stress physiol-
ogy and evolutionary biology or molecular biology (or
combination of all). A drosophila expertise will be a
strong bonus.
Two other PhD positions will be available on the other
aspects of the project and will be advertised separately.
General requirements for the position We ask ^Aa MSc
degree in Biological or Evolutionary Sciences with mul-
tidisciplinary prole. In addition to the specic skills
required, the candidate should be a team player with
demonstrable experience in collaboration with ecolo-
gists, molecular biologists and/or entomologists. He/she
should have excellent communication skills and should
be uent in English.
Conditions of employment PhD is full-time position.
Doctoral studies in France last 3 years. PhD programs
are managed by Doctoral Schools (Ecoles Doctorales)
that can be aliated to one or several universities.
Overall academic costs in France are low (around 400
euro/year tuition fees in universities) and there is an ad-
ditional Government support aided to Foreign students
in promoting research. Most of the PhD oers are linked
to a scholarship of approximately 1700 euro/month
(gross salary).

*PhD positions in Population Genetics and Adaptive
Evolution*
Multiple PhD positions are available in the Hancock
lab in association with an ERC-funded project to recon-
struct the history of *Arabidopsis thaliana* from the
Cape Verde Islands. Research in the lab is aimed at
understanding the genetic basis and evolutionary history
of complex traits, with a particular focus on adaptive
evolution.
We use an integrative approach to gain a detailed under-
standing of the adaptive process. This provides oppor-
tunities for a range of potential projects, where dierent
sets of skills are employed. For example, there are po-
tential projects for those with purely computational or
purely molecular backgrounds; however, all projects will
involve some degree of data analysis and computational
work.
Approaches used in the lab include NGS sequencing,14 EvolDir December 1, 2015
trait-mapping using natural and recombinant popula-
tions, functional analysis using CRISPR/Cas9, compu-
tational modeling and population genetic analysis.
Ideal candidates are highly motivated and passionate
about research.
Prior research experience in any of the following areas
would be an advantage:
- Statistical analysis of genomic data - Program-
ming - Arabidopsis/Plant Biology - Population Genet-
ics/Quantitative Genetics - Adaptive evolution - Molec-
ular biology
The working language of the laboratory and of the In-
stitute is English.
Applications will be reviewed starting on December 1.

Background and Tasks: Infectious disease strongly regu-
lates populations. However, some forms of disease arise
internally by mutation causing cancer. Usually, cancer
cells are evolutionary dead ends that die with the individ-
ual carrying them. Recently, several contagious cancers
have been discovered in marine bivalves. Here, cancer
cells made the transition to parasitism by proliferating
within and between populations, which may strongly
aect bivalve population dynamics. The planned PhD
project will investigate the ecological and evolutionaryroles of contagious cancer (disseminated neoplasia) in
bivalves along a latitudinal gradient from temperate to
arctic regions. The comparative approach will combine
systematic observational data on the occurence of neo-
plasia with experimental work investigating ecological
eects in the eld and in the lab. Practical work will in-
clude sampling and eld experiments in the Netherlands,
Germany, Denmark and Norway (including extended
stays on Spitsbergen) and molecular and cytological
techniques will be used to identify the evolutionary ori-

Cardi SheepGenomics
Genome-wide analysis of maternal ability in the Lleyn
sheep
Research Area: Agriculture and Food Security
This project will be carried out in collaboration with the
Lleyn Sheep Society using cutting edge genomics tools
to identify the genetic basis of some key and valuableproduction characteristics of the Lleyn breed, especially
maternal ability and prolicacy. The Lleyn is a very suc-
cessful and productive breed that has grown rapidly for
the last 15 years throughout the UK. Breed improvement
is on-going in this forward-thinking Society through ini-
tiatives including detailed performance recording using
powerful statistical tools, however, using genomics will
speed up this process and the results are often more
accurate. Genomic screening is now cost-eective in
sheep, and selection using genome wide data is espe-
cially useful for the traits needed to be improved for this
breed Vwhich are dicult to measure, which have low
heritability, and/or are only expressed in one sex (e.g.
female-specic characteristics such as milk production).
This project will therefore assess allelic variation across
almost 700,000 markers in the sheep genome and a
Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) will be car-
ried out to identify genes associated with maternal abil-
ity and prolicacy and to estimate Genomic Breeding
Values (GEBVs) for improvement. Both of these traits
have been studied in other sheep, with eight candidate
genes having been identied so far, but the genes or
their variants controlling these characteristics may be
dierent in the Lleyn.
An initial molecular analysis of the breed across its geo-
graphic range and pedigree will ensure that 'typical' and
equivalent individuals are compared. The experiment
will then be developed with the Society to encompass
as many facets of the breed as feasible without com-
promising statistical power. Modern GWAS statistical
approaches will be taken, with environmental, pheno-
typic and production variables included, accounting for
relevant factors and their interactions. If a relationship
between marker variation and production characteris-
tics is identied, further gene-based analysis will be
carried out to determine whether variation at one or
more gene regions can be identied and developed to
provide a test for the Society. Application of GWAS
data to produce GEBVs to enhance the early selection
power of performance recording systems would then be
developed. This project will provide excellent training
in modern agricultural technology, including genomics,
statistical analysis and experimental design. It will be
carried out in close collaboration with the Breed Society
and SignetFBC performance recorders and will include
substantial on-farm research.

Duration: The SWBio DTP follows a 4-year PhD model.
In the rst year, students receive a range of directed
training, tailored to support their PhD project. This
includes a series of compulsory taught units (taught
co-localised) and self-directed study that take up about
one-third of the students available time. In addition stu-
dents will experience two assessed laboratory rotations
in year 1, each in separate disciplines but designed to

1) Reconstructing the evolutionary history of ecological
dynamics and extinction risk in Procellariiform seabirds
During their evolutionary history, birds have colonized
the open oceans beyond the continental shelves only
rarely. The Procellariiformes (albatrosses, shearwaters,
storm- petrels, etc.) are by far the largest group of
oceanic birds, but their molecular phylogeny is poorly
known. As part of an international collaboration, the
student will use capture enrichment and next generation
sequencing methods to collect a rich genomic dataset
and resolve the phylogeny of all extant and recently
extinct Procellariiformes, at and below the species level.
This will advance our understanding of the evolutionary
history of oceanic birds, allow exploration of the role
of ecology in diversication, and inform conservation
management of this globally-threatened group.
Eligibility: All nationalities Deadline for consideration:

2) The eects of maternal stress response and micro-
biome on seal pup condition and survival Co-supervised
with Sean Twiss
Maternal eects are now recognised as important con-
tributors to phenotypic variation. One potential mecha-
nism that has been largely overlooked is via the transfer
of benecial bacteria during birth and through lacta-
tion. Studies in humans have shown that these bacteria
provide many health benets to the young, but that com-
munities transferred can be inuenced by the mother ^As
condition and stress level. Adult grey seals (Halichoerus
grypus) exhibit consistent individual dierences in be-
haviour with some mothers showing high levels of re-
sponsiveness to stressors while others show little. The
student will apply recently developed metagenomic tech-
niques to investigate this potential short-term tness
consequence of maternal coping style. Seals are among
the few animal species for which coping styles have been
identied and linked with tness consequences in wild
populations. However, the mechanisms through which
behavioural responses to stress modulate ospring con-
dition and survival remain essentially unknown. Given
that wildlife are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic
inuences, and that behaviour is often the rst form
of response to environmental changes, this project will
provide important insights towards understanding howstress may inuence individual tness as well as future
population trajectories.
Eligibility: Primarily UK nationals Deadline for consid-
eration: January 15th, 2016
3) Tracking the impact of Holocene environmental
change in Patagonia on pinniped distribution, abun-
dance and dispersion using ancient DNA Co-supervised
with Rus Hoelzel
When environments change, as during the current pro-
cess of anthropogenic climate change, regional popula-
tions may respond by migrating to track suitable habitat,
they may expand, decline or go extinct, or they may
adapt. In this study the student will employ next gener-
ation sequencing methods, ancient DNA, and coalescent
analyses to determine past demographic proles of two
sympatric pinniped species with contrasting life histories
along the coast of Patagonia, a region of major transi-
tions during the Holocene. Thus students will have the
opportunity to test hypotheses about the importance of
various environmental parameters. Understanding these
dynamics will become increasingly critical for eective
management and nature reserve design to promote con-
servation in the future as environments change. This
will also improve our understanding of the process of
biodiversity evolution, which is determined by both
eective population size and connectivity.
Eligibility: Primarily UK nationals Deadline for consid-
eration: January 22nd, 2016

Competitive PhD studentship (sponsored by NERC)
available to UK nationals at Durham University:
Tracking the impact of Holocene environmental change
in Patagonia on pinniped distribution, abundance and
dispersion using ancient DNA
When environments change, as during the current pro-
cess of anthropogenic climate change, regional popula-
tions may respond by migrating to track suitable habitat,
they may expand, decline or go extinct, or they may
adapt. Adaptation to climate change may be plastic or
by the process of natural selection, and there is empirical
evidence for both. Understanding these dynamics will
become increasingly critical for eective management
and nature reserve design to promote conservation in
the future as environments change. This will also im-
prove our understanding of the process of biodiversity
evolution, which is determined by both eective popu-
lation size and connectivity. In this study the student
will employ next generation sequencing methods, an-
cient DNA and coalescent analyses to determine past
demographic proles of two sympatric pinniped species
with contrasting life histories. The study will focus on
the marine coastal habitat o Patagonia, a region of
major transitions during the Holocene, providing the
opportunity to test hypotheses about the importance
of various environmental parameters. Ancient materials
for the study have been acquired from middens left by

The Schenk lab at Georgia Southern University invites
applicants for a Masters Degree in plant systematics
and evolution, starting Fall semester, 2016. Our lab
group is interested in how botanical diversity has been
shaped by the interactions among morphological, eco-
logical, and species diversication. We apply statistical
phylogenetic approaches that quantify and incorporate
molecular, morphological, and ecological variation to
plant systems in order to understand the evolutionary
processes of how and why species diversify.
An ideal candidate will have interest in using plant sys-
tems to better understand the evolutionary processes
of diversication by applying statistical phylogenetic
approaches. Competitive students that meet all re-
quirements will be supported with either a teaching or
research assistantship.

Leicester SocialInsectEvolution
Social hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) are impor-
tant emerging models for epigenetics . This is based on
theoretical predictions for a role for genomic imprinting
in their social organisation and on data showing a fun-damental role for methylation in their biology. Genomic
imprinting is allele specic expression in diploid individ-
uals, where expression is dependent on the sex of the
parent from which an allele was inherited. In mammals
and owering plants, genomic imprinting is often asso-
ciated with methylation marks passed from parents to
ospring . Given the diversity within the Hymenoptera,
especially in social structure, this research area would
benet from an increase in the breadth of the species
studied. Bumblebees, which are singly mated, have the
advantage that theory provides simple clear predictions
for what sort of genes should be imprinted. The recently
sequenced genome of the bumblebee,displays a full com-
plement of genes involved in the methylation system.
Our lab has demonstrated that methylation is impor-
tant in worker reproduction in this bumblebee. We
also recently found allele specic expression in Bombus
terrestris worker reproduction genes using a candidate
gene qPCR based approach. Please see the particulars
for more details.
The PhD student will carry out all experiments and
bioinformatic analysis under the guidance of the super-
visory team. They will be provided with training in
R, a powerful and increasing popular statistical pro-
gramming language, Python, a general-purpose, high-
level programming language widely used in bioinformat-
ics, molecular biology, RNA-seq, anatomical dissection
and neuroanatomy, in situ hybridisation, confocal mi-
croscopy and bee husbandry as required.
We are an equal opportunities employer and particu-
larly welcome applications for Ph.D. places from women,
minority ethnic and other under-represented groups.

FishEvolution
PhD position in Fish Ecophysiology
A PhD studentship position is available at the Depart-
ment of Biology. The appointment duration is 3 years.
The position is nanced by the NTNU.
Job description The theme of the PhD position is ther-
mal biology (physiology, behaviour and evolution) of
sh. The Norwegian University of Science and Tech-
nology (NTNU) in Trondheim Norway is seeking a new
graduate student (PhD studentship) to research thermal
biology in sh. The position starts early 2016.
As climate change is making aquatic habitats warmer,
sh can respond by migration, acclimatization or adap-
tation, but most often combinations of these strategies.
This project will investigate both the acclimatization
and adaptation potential of sh to thermal challenges.
The PhD project aims to ll major knowledge gaps
in the eld of thermal biology. The main questions
that will be addressed are: Which physiological mecha-
nisms limit thermal performance and tolerance? How
adaptable are these mechanisms? What are the con-
nections between thermal physiology and behaviour?
Which physiological and behavioural traits are most
important for ecological tness in a warming world?
To answer these questions the PhD student will use
various physiological and behavioural measurements.
The techniques will likely include in-vivo animal experi-
ments, thermal exposures, multi-generation experiments,
exercise respirometry, electrophysiology, automated be-
havioural analysis and more. The work will mainly
be done at the well-equipped labs at NTNU, but re-
search abroad is also likely. Ecophysiology and the
study of anthropogenic stressors, including the eects
of climate change, is a priority research area at the
Department of Biology. The zoophysiology research
group has broad national and international research
collaborations and the permanent scientic stas are
recognized as international leaders and researchers in
their respective disciplines. The Jutfelt lab conducts
ecophysiological research on sh at NTNU, but also
abroad at locations such as Kristineberg Marine Station
in Sweden, Lizard Island Research Station in Australia
and Polar Regions. Further information is availableDecember 1, 2015 EvolDir 27
at: http://bioenv.gu.se/english/sta/jutfelt fredrik The
appointment will be made according to the general reg-
ulations regarding university employees, wage level 50,

Olson Lab, Texas Tech University
The Olson lab at Texas Tech University is recruiting
PhD Graduate students interested in the eld of plant
ecological genetics to start in the fall of 2016. Our lab
studies a variety of questions including the evolution
of breeding systems, sex chromosome evolution, the
evolution of gender dimorphism in plants, and local
adaptation to latitude in relation to climate change. We
use a variety of experimental techniques including com-
mon garden studies, eld ecology, transmission genetics,
genomics and bioinformatics. For the past decade we
have studied these processes in forest trees and expect
that this will continue to be the main taxonomic focus
of our research.
Funds are available for a Graduate Research Associate
on an NSF-funded grant to study the ecological and
genetic factors inuencing the dynamic movement of sex
determination regions and sex chromosome evolution
within the Salicaceae (poplars and willows). The overall
project focuses on mapping sex determination regions
from representatives throughout the family, understand-
ing the genetic basis of gender dimorphism in defense
and pollinator attraction chemistry, and the assessment
of population genetic patterns across the sex determina-
tion and pseudo-autosomal regions of the sex chromo-
somes. Graduate students working on this project will32 EvolDir December 1, 2015
have the opportunity to choose from a variety of projects
including, but not limited to, mapping the locations of
previously unknown sex determination regions, devel-
opment of phylogenies for important plant groups, and
studying the evolution of sexual dimorphism in plant
defensive and pollinator attraction compounds. More-
over, the grant provides for a unique multi-institutional
and international training environment, with potential
funding to visit labs at the University of West Virginia,
the University of Wisconsin, Cornell University, and
Sichuan University and Nanjing Forestry University in
China for cross-disciplinary training.

WheatComparativeGenomics
Dear Evoldir'ers
Last chance to apply for this comparative genomics PhD
focussing on alternative splicing in hexaploid wheat.
http://www.tgac.ac.uk/studentships/dtp-studentships/-
revealing-the-alternative-splicing-landscape-of-wheat-
through-comparative-transcriptomics/ Alternative
splicing (AS) is a mechanism that enables multiple
distinct mRNAs to be formed from a single gene.
Recent studies suggest that over 60 per cent of intron-
containing genes in plants undergo AS, generating a
vast repertoire of transcript isoforms.
While the importance of AS in contributing to protein
diversity in plant and animal genomes is now well es-
tablished few studies have examined AS in polyploid
species. Polyploidy is the possession of more than two
complete sets of chromosomes and is especially com-mon in plants. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an
allohexaploid (AABBDD) with the three subgenomes
A, B and D derived from three diploid species within
tribe Triticeae. Dierential regulation of AS between
the subgenomes may allow more regulatory exibility in
duplicated genes, AS has therefore potentially played an
important role in the evolution and adaptation of culti-
vated crops to dierent environmental conditions and
niches. This proposal aims to investigate the immediate
and long-term eects of polyploidy on AS, examine the
importance of AS in the evolution of duplicated genes
and its potential role in domestication.
The successful student will apply the latest computa-
tional approaches and sequencing technologies to iden-
tify how much variation in AS exists in synthetic wheat
hybrid lines and between wheat and its progenitor
species. This will provide for the rst time a detailed
view of the role AS has played in the evolution and adap-
tation of wheat and its relationship to hybridisation and
polyploidy. The student will have access to a high-
performance computing environment and the opportu-
nity to learn about gene regulation, transcriptomics,
genome analysis, transcript assembly, bioinformatics
and software development.

UAlberta EvolutionHostParasite
Graduate student position - Ecology and Evolution of
Host-parasite Interactions
A graduate research position (MSc or PhD) is avail-
able in Dr. Lien Luong's research group (http:/-
/www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/lien luong/) at the
University of Alberta. Students interested in the ecology
and evolution of infectious diseases and/or parasite-host
interactions are encouraged to apply.
Pathogenic organisms that are harmless under certain
conditions can suddenly become extremely harmful un-
der dierent circumstances. Indeed levels of parasitism
vary continuously in nature, with some species shifting
along a continuum from benign to pathogenic over eco-
logical and evolutionary time. But even more fundamen-
tal to this issue is the process by which parasitism per se
evolved. One of our goals is to investigate the life-history
evolution of parasites that express variation in host ex-
ploitation strategies, and identify the selection pressures
that lead to the transition to a parasitic lifestyle. Fac-
ultative parasites present a unique and interesting op-
portunity for addressing these questions because they
regularly shift from free-living to parasitic lifestyles.
The facultative ectoparasitic mite, Macrocheles subba-
dius feeds and reproduces on highly ephemeral habitats.
Mites become parasitic under certain circumstances by
attaching to and feeding on Drosophila fruit y hosts.
The Department of Biological Sciences at U of A is one of
the largest and most scientically diverse departments
of its kind in Canada. We oer research-orientated,

starting Oct 2016 Love thy neighbour? Social and sex-
ual accommodation in fruities
Supervisors: Tracey Chapman and Irina Mohorianu (Bi-
ological Sciences, UEA, UK); Amanda Bretman (School
of Biology, Leeds, UK).
This PhD project oers an exciting and unique training
opportunity to test the eect of manipulating sensory
communication on the ability of male fruities to sense
their social and sexual environment. The student will
gain research skills in cutting-edge genetic, genomic ma-
nipulations and novel bioinformatics. They will receive
excellent training from the thriving Norwich Biosciences
Doctoral Training Partnership:

viduals of many species adjust to their environment
to increase their potential competitiveness. A familiar
example is 'speech accommodation', where individuals,
often unintentionally, adopt the accent or speech pat-
terns of those around them. In fruities, males show
precise responses to their social and sexual environment.
Following detection of conspecic rivals, males transfer
more ejaculate proteins to females and sire more o-
spring. Males detect rivals using multiple, redundant
sensory inputs. The rst aim is to test the idea that
this system is robust, immune to mis-ring and confers
signicant benets.
Our recent analysis of gene expression in males exposed
to rivals reveals a signature of redundancy, with similar
sensory inputs following dierent pathways to result in
the same output. The second aim is to test directly
for such genomic redundancy, by analyzing the gene ex-
pression patterns of responding males that lack sensory
inputs.
The nal aim is to test whether the same rules apply to
detection in interactions involving males of closely re-lated species. 'Mistakes' in identication are apparently
not related to relatedness or the potential to hybridise.
The proposed project is at the forefront of identifying
recognition mechanisms and is relevant to insect con-
trol, by using our knowledge to manipulate reproductive
biology via gene silencing.

UEdinburgh 2 PlantEvolution
Project 1: Ecological consequences of plant parasitism
in Euphrasia
Parasitism is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the natural
world, with dramatic evolutionary and ecological conse-
quences for both the host and the parasite. There are
over 3000 described parasitic plant species, including
Rhinanthus, which maintains grassland ecosystems by
stunting the growth of other herbaceous plants, and
Striga, which decimates 12 billion dollars? worth of rice
crops each year. While plant parasitism has a major
eect on natural ecosystems, our understanding of the
ecology of plant parasitism is surprisingly poor. In or-
der to understand the origin and maintenance of plant
parasitism, it is necessary to study the tness benet
plant parasites receive from host attachment, and the
genes associated with the parasitic plant syndrome.
This project investigates the ecological consequences
of parasitism in Euphrasia, a group of generalist plant
parasites which can grow independently, but grow more
vigorously when attached to a suitable host plant. The
genus includes c. 20 species in the UK, with each species
showing notable habitat preferences (e.g. coastal, mon-
tane, meadow), and thus potentially dierent local host
preferences, too. We have recently made seed collections
from populations across the UK, as well as developed
new genomic resources (whole draft-genome sequences),
enabling us to investigate the ecological signicance and
genomic basis of parasitism and host preferences.
This project incorporates large-scale plant growth trials
and cutting-edge gene expression data to address the36 EvolDir December 1, 2015
following research questions:
1. Do Euphrasia species adapted to dierent habitats
(montane vs coastal) have preferences for dierent host
species? 2. What are the phenotypic and ecophysiologi-
cal changes with alternative host attachment? 3. Are
there major gene expression changes associated with
attaching to dierent host plants?
In addition to answering these research questions, this
project will also involve an industrial placement with
CASE partner Scotia Seeds, the leading producer of
wildower seeds in Scotland. During a series of short
placements throughout the PhD, the student will test
germination protocols and procedures for growing Eu-
phrasia as a commercial crop for wildower seed mixes.
Overall, this project represents an exciting example of
where the combination of growth trials and genomic
tools may give insight into classic, yet unanswered, ques-
tions in evolutionary biology.

plant-parasitism-euphrasia Project 2: The importance
of genome duplication in the origin of novel plant
diversity
Related species often show dierences in genome struc-
ture, with whole genome duplication (polyploidy) rep-
resenting one of the most dramatic forms of genomic
variation. Whole genome duplication has long interested
evolutionary biologists, as it may prevent cross-mating
between diverging taxa, and thus promote speciation.
However, recent genomic analyses have cast doubt on
this assumption, as ongoing gene ow has been de-
tected between polyploids and their diploid relatives.
Additional genomic studies are required to test whether
polyploidy can cause instantaneous and complete repro-
ductive isolation, and thus be a mechanism underlying
sympatric speciation.
This project will investigate the importance of poly-
ploidy in the evolution of the plant genus Euphrasia
(eyebrights). This genus includes c. 20 species in the
UK, with diploids and tetraploids that commonly co-
occur and are thought to occasionally hybridize. We
have recently sequenced the complete genome of the
diploid, and shown that diploids and tetraploids are
highly genetically divergent. We have also located a
site in South Wales where diploids and tetraploids co-
occur. These resources and observations provide the
background for further studies investigating polyploidy
and hybridization in this group. This project will use
draft genome sequences, and generate new population
genomic data and eld observations, in order to:
1. Understand genomic dierences between diploids andtetraploids. 2. Observe the extent of localised gene ow
in a diploid-tetraploid hybrid zone. 3. Look for evidence
of historical gene ow between diploids and tetraploids
across the UK.
This project will use cutting-edge genomic tools and
classic eld observations to shed light on an important
yet poorly understood evolutionary processes. This
project will oer training in genomic analysis, and in-
clude eldwork in South Wales and other areas of the
United Kingdom.

Project Description Project background \ the two most
diverse animal groups on earth are insect herbivores
and their parasitoid natural enemies, which provide the
key ecosystem service of biological control. Herbivore-
enemy interactions are embedded in wider communi-
ties, which face perturbation from stressors including
climate change and biological invasions. Theory pre-
dicts that impacts on herbivore food plants will cascade
through trophic networks, particularly when the plants
are keystone or foundation species. This project will
use experimental oak plantations and recent biologi-
cal invasions to explore responses of forest tree-insectDecember 1, 2015 EvolDir 37
herbivore-parasitoid communities to two environmental
change impacts:
1) Eects of assisted migration of forest trees as a miti-
gation strategy for climate change. Climate Matching
is a forest management strategy that involves introduc-
tion of trees from source populations (provenances) that
experience today the climate predicted in Britain in 50
" 80 years time. While adaptation to warmer climates
should mitigate the impact of climate change, but at the
potential cost of importing new, non locally adapted,
tree genotypes. The strategy is currently being tested in
experimental trials involving trees from a range of prove-
nances. Previous work by the supervisors has shown how
the phenotypic traits of introduced provenances inu-
ence insect herbivore communities (Sinclair et al 2015).
This PhD will extend this work to explore impacts on
the associated natural enemies. Theory predicts that
parasitoid communities will also respond to the pheno-
typic variation of their preys host plant. We will test this
prediction utilising parasitoids already collected from
a large provenance trial in France, with opportunities
to collect further samples from similar trials in the UK.
This aspect of the project will require DNA barcoding,
the analysis of trophic networks, and will develop skills
in the rapidly expanding eld of community genetics
(Whitham et al 2006, Wimp et al 2007).
This project will provide training in experimental de-
sign, data management, statistical methods for handling,
analysing and interpreting large datasets, taxonomy &
systematics, and eld work. The student will also re-
ceive training in lab and analytical skills associated
with DNA barcode sequences, and population genetic
data. We seek a candidate with strong quantitative and
analytical skills, and interest in the use and analysis
of DNA sequence data. Interest in insect biodiversity
and ecosystem impacts of environmental change is an
advantage.
2) Eects of species introduction via biological invasions:
Biological invasions are an increasingly important aspect
of environmental change, with potential major impacts
on native communities. The second component of this
project will study the development of parasitoid commu-
nities around an economically important invader \ the
chestnut gallwasp, Dryocosmus kuriphilus. Originating
in China, it was rst recorded in Europe from Italy in
2002. It has since spread across southern Europe and
was rst recorded in the UK in 2015. It has rapidly
accumulated a suite of native European natural enemies,
primarily from related oak gallwasps, which provide po-
tential for biological control (Quacchia et al 2013). This
project will test alternative hypotheses for the assembly
of these new parasitoid communities, and explore po-
tential impact on native herbivore communities by therecent release of a biocontrol agent, the parasitoid wasp
Torymus sinensis (Gibbs et al 2011).

InsectPopulationGenetics
I would like to advertise a PhD project at the University
of Edinburgh.
Selection in a guild of Hymenopteran parasitoids
Advisory team: Dr. Konrad Lohse (Edinburgh), Prof.
Graham Stone (Edinburgh) and Prof. Mike Ritchie (St
Andrews)
Genomic studies have been tremendously successful in
detecting the footprints of past selection. However, stud-
ies of selection have mainly been restricted to individual
species with little regard for the ecological interactions
that underlie selection or the demographic setting in
which it occurs. Decreasing costs of high throughput
sequencing make it possible to address new questions
through analysis of comparative datasets for multiple
species. In particular, co-distributed species that share
the same environment (e.g. parasitoid wasps exploiting
a shared set of host species) should face highly corre-
lated selective pressures, and this should be detectable
by comparing signals of selection across their genomes.
Replicating selection tests across species also greatly in-
creases statistical power to detect selection at individual
loci.38 EvolDir December 1, 2015
The aim of this project is to investigate selection in a
natural guild of chalcid parasitoid wasps attacking oak
galls in Europe. The Stone and Lohse labs have re-
cently generated population genomic data for 12 chalcid
species of parasitoids from six dierent families. Species
are sampled in reciprocal pairs of in- and outgroups
and each species includes multiple individual genomes
from three dierent populations. The geographic distri-
butions, population histories and host associations of
these parasitoids are well studied, providing an excellent
comparative framework for the study.
This dataset provides a unique opportunity to study
selection in a comparative framework and at two time
scales: Long-term selection will be quantied using clas-
sic population genetic tests based on divergence. More
detailed analyses can be used to model recent selective
sweeps. The latter will make use of the fact that the
data are from haploid males, so include complete phase
information. The project will use a combination of
genome scans for outlier loci and comparison between
candidate genes involved in host-parasitoid interactions
(e.g. olfactory and gustatory receptor genes, and genes
expressed in the venom gland) to address the following
questions: i) To what extent does long-term selection
correlate with recent selection? ii) how common are
strong selective sweeps and does their frequency increase
following range expansions? iii) Is selection increased
at candidate genes that are involved in co-evolutionary
interactions with higher and/or lower trophic levels?
iv) Does the strength of selection correlate with key
life-history traits, for example dispersal ability or the
range of host species?
The project will be based mainly on existing genomic
data and will also incorporate previously collected eco-
logical data (e.g. host associations) and demographic
models for these species. Additional genomic data for
selected target species will be generated to increase sta-
tistical power in comparative analyses. The project is
very exible and - depending on the interest and experi-
ence of the applicant - could also involve investigating
the evolution of sex specic genes, other comparative
datasets or a strong theoretical component. The project
will also involve some entomological eld trips and a
small amount of wetlab work.

Cognitive processes are vital for carrying out the day-
to-day behaviours needed for survival and reproduction.
Comparative psychologists have made great progress
in determining the cognitive mechanisms underpinning
behaviour, showing that many species are capable of
performing more sophisticated cognitive tasks than pre-
viously thought. However, it is also becoming clear that
cognitive performance varies can vary a lot among in-
dividuals within populations of the same species. This
variation is hugely signicant as it is a prerequisite for
both natural selection and genetic variation - the two
ingredients for ongoing adaptive evolution. This project
will take an experimental approach to determine the
genetic causes and consequences of among-individual
variation in cognition in guppies, Poecilia reticulata. It
will do this by combining lab-based behavioural studies
with quantitative genetic modelling to frame and test
evolutionary hypotheses about the causes and conse-
quences of (genetic) variation in cognition.

Project description:
The Enterocytozoonidae family of microsporidia is home
to two economically important pathogens: Enterocyto-
zoon bieneusi, which is one of the most common causes
of AIDS-associated diarrhoea; and Enterocytozoon hep-
atopenaei, a Tiger and Whiteleg shrimp pathogen ini-
tially found in Thailand but now reported to have spread
to China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and India. This
pathogen has emerged very rapidly and is set to cause
multimillion-dollar losses to shrimp production. Infec-
tions are now at a critical level with some farms nding
E. hepatopenaei in 100% of shrimp ponds. Both humans
and shrimps may be acquiring these infections from envi-
ronmental reservoirs of, as yet, unidentied intermediate
hosts, which means that transmission routes for these
pathogens are poorly understood. This studentship
aims to resolve two questions in Enterocytozoonidae
transmission biology, which will inform strategies aimed
at limiting spread of these pathogens.
What is the environmental diversity of the Enterocy-
tozoonidae? We will take an environmental DNA ap-
proach to identify reservoirs or carriers for the Ente-
rocytozoonidae and further species that may have the
capacity to cause human or animal disease. Water sam-
ples and invertebrates will be collected from domestic
sewage, riverine, estuarine and coastal habitats (rep-
resenting transition environments between human and
aquatic animal populations) and from shrimp ponds in
Thailand. Samples will be processed for downstream
DNA extraction and histology. We will generate a pro-
le of Enterocytozoonidae diversity by extracting DNA,
amplifying a variable stretch of the 18s rRNA gene
using Enterocytozoonidae specic primers, and deep
sequencing of amplicon libraries using in-house Illumina
MiSeq. When DNA sequences with high similarity to E.
bieneusi or E. hepatopenaei are found, they will be used
as labelled probes for in situ hybridisation to identify po-
tential intermediate hosts. This research aim will equip
us to identify and track natural reservoirs of emerging
human and shrimp pathogens.
How is E. hepatopenaei spreading between shrimp
farms? Transmission to new regions and hosts may
be mediated by movement of infected shrimp, by un-
known intermediate hosts and/or by contaminated feed.
Here we propose to use population genomics to identify
how transmission has occurred. Genomes of E. hep-atopenaei from shrimp farms located in central, eastern
and southern regions of Thailand, from China, and from
both Whiteleg and Tiger shrimp hosts will be sequenced
using in-house Illumina MiSeq. Relationships between
the isolates will be determined from genome-wide pat-
terns of variation and used to infer transmission routes
and inform aquaculture policies to prevent future spread
of the infection.

The James Hutton Institute/ University of Glasgow
joint PhD studentship
Biodiversity impacts on Lyme disease risk and pathogen
genetics
This is a joint PhD project between Drs Lucy Gilbert
and Justine Irvine at the James Hutton Institute and
Dr Roman Biek at the University of Glasgow.
Background: The largest policy-driven land-use change
in the UK is currently woodland regeneration/ expan-
sion. The benets of this include climate change mit-
igation and enhancing water quality and biodiversity.
However, some of this biodiversity plays a role in the
transmission of the tick-borne Lyme disease: deer are
the most important hosts for ticks, while rodents and
birds each transmit their own genotypic strain of Borre-
lia, the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Most Lyme
disease infections in humans are picked up in woodlands,
and Borrelia is more prevalent in high biodiversity semi-
natural mixed woodland than coniferous plantations
(James et al. 2013 Parasitology). We now need to iden-
tify the host-driven mechanisms for these patterns of
Lyme disease risk. This will inform woodland design
and access planning. Lyme disease is a potentially de-
bilitating tick-borne disease with a high media prole
and is of increasing concern to policy. However, the
mechanisms driving the pathogen's abundance and di-
versity remain poorly understood due to the complex
ecology of its multiple hosts and the tick vector. We
predict that higher densities of the main tick host (deer)
and transmission hosts (rodents) result in higher Lyme
disease risk overall and a change in Borrelia genotype.
Aims: The overarching aim is to test the role of relative
densities of mammalian hosts on Borrelia prevalence,
density of infected ticks (an indication of Lyme disease
risk), and Borrelia genotypes. Specically, using both
comparative and experimental approaches we will test
the hypotheses that there is greater Lyme disease risk
in areas of (1) higher deer density and (2) higher rodent
density; and (3) Borrelia afzelii, the rodent genotype, is
more prevalent with increasing rodent densities.
This 3.5yr studentship is funded under the James HuttonDecember 1, 2015 EvolDir 43
Institute/University Joint PhD programme, in this case
with the University of Glasgow as the degree-awarding
partner. Candidates are urged strongly to apply as soon
as possible so as to stand the best chance of success. A
more detailed plan of the studentship is available to suit-
able candidates upon application. Funding is available
for European applications, but Worldwide applicants
who possess suitable self-funding are also invited to

PhD POSITION IN EVOLUTIONARY AND DEVEL-
OPMENTAL BIOLOGY: Molecular mechanisms of the
repeated evolution of color patterns in cichlid shesThe Department of Biology, University of Konstanz,
Germany and the International Max Planck Research
School for Organismal Biology (IMPRS) invites applica-
tions for a PhD position (TV-L E13 60%). The position
is funded by the Baden W ^A^A1rttemberg Stiftung as
part of the ^A^AEliteprogramm f ^A^A1r Postdocs ^A^A and
available from April 2016 or later (application deadline:
15.1.2016). We are seeking highly qualied students
holding a M.Sc. (or equivalent) with a strong interest
in developmental biology, genetics, and evolutionary
biology. High motivation, creativity and a cooperative
personality are expected. Applicants should ideally have
a background in developmental biology and/or genet-
ics and practical skills in molecular techniques. Prior
experience with sh is preferred, but not essential. We
oer a PhD position for three years within a highly
competitive multidisciplinary and international research
environment. The PhD program of the IMPRS gradu-
ate school oers a comprehensive mentoring program,
specic courses for organismal biology and support for
career development.
The project focuses on the molecular mechanisms that
underlie the development of coloration traits in cichlid
shes. The distinctiveness of their color patterns is well
captured by the German popular name - Buntbarsche,
or colorful perches. Many of these exuberant color pat-
terns have evolved repeatedly in dierent species and
even within dierent lakes. Yet, still little is known
about the genetic changes that are necessary to gen-
erate these traits. In particular this project addresses
the repeated evolution of stripe patterns within cichlids.
Here, horizontal stripe and vertical bar patterns occur
and evolved repeatedly in dierent lakes in the African
Rift Valley. These are driven by ecological adaptations
to similar habitat environments. The project will take
advantage of genetic [e.g. QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci)
mapping], genomic (targeted genome sequencing) and
state-of-the-art molecular and developmental biology ap-
proaches (transgenesis, genome editing and chromatin
immunoprecipitation). The aim of the project will be
to analyze the genetic and molecular basis of an ecolog-
ically well- described adaptive phenotype that evolved
repeatedly within short evolutionary times.
Application: Application deadline is January 15, 2016.
Interested applicants should apply through the IMPRS
homepage: www.orn.mpg.de/2383/Application . The
University of Konstanz encourages disabled persons to

Quinnell (SoB, Leeds, UK)
Closing date for applications: 11th January 2016
Project summary : This project will build on our pre-
vious studies of the disease ecology and genetics of
mosquito-borne diseases in the Galapagos Islands and
the implications for health and conservation of endemic
bird species in the archipelago. We will examine the
role that native and introduced mosquito species play
in the transmission of plasmodium parasites, and the
potential for spill-over of potentially pathogenic plas-
modium strains from migratory and introduced bird
species into Galapagos endemic avifauna. The project
will generate new knowledge on the disease ecology
of plasmodium parasites within Galapagos bird com-
munities and relative roles of native and introduced
mosquitoes in plasmodium disease cycles, using a range
of ecological, laboratory, and population/evolutionary
genetic approaches. The results will help guide conser-
vation strategies and biosecurity policies with regard to
avian disease and invasive vectors in Galapagos. The
work will also extend our general understanding of avianvector-borne disease ecology, and the processes involved
in the emergence of novel diseases or the spread of dis-
eases into new geographic ranges.

2016 Interviews: Week commencing 25 January 2016
Start Date: 26 September 2016
Project Description: Over the last decade, NGS has
revolutionised biology allowing cost-eective characteri-
sation of whole genomes; this holds great promise as the
next innovation in forensic analysis too. Illumina has
developed a human forensic NGS kit that allows simulta-
neous testing of multiple autosomal and Y-specic STRs,
mtDNA and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
This multi-target approach conserves biological material
whilst maximizing discrimination and eciency. This
same approach could be applied to animal and plant
forensic evidence allowing both human and non-human
tests to be performed using a common platform, bioin-formatics pipeline, and ultimately reporting procedure.
This iCASE studentship will explore the approach as
applied to birds of prey. Theft from the wild for resale to
the falconry trade has been a lucrative undertaking and
DNA testing via classical approaches has already led to
many court cases in the UK. However, nowadays, foren-
sic service providers cannot support such specialised
tests but an NGS approach could circumvent this. Fur-
thermore, since birds of prey are indicator species of
the environment, the developed multiplexes may also
be a useful tool for molecular ecologists and conserva-
tion biologists. The project will involve mutation rate
analysis to establish exclusion probabilities, creation of
population reference databases, and multiplex design,
validation and implementation on the Illumina MiSeq
platform.
The industrial partner, Illumina is a global leader in
genomics, developing and manufacturing platforms and
associated consumables as well as providing bioinfor-
matics solutions for modern day analyses of genetic
variation. The successful applicant will undertake a
placement within Illuminas UK specialist forensic ge-
nomics division during which they will
- receive comprehensive practical training on the Illu-
mina NGS platforms, - be trained in NGS data inter-
pretation, specically in the context of forensic analysis
and case reporting, using ForenSeq analysis software
and other data analysis pipeline packages as appropri-
ate, - be placed within one of Illuminas development
teams, working alongside highly skilled application sci-
entists to develop high quality commercial laboratory
skills, e.g. working to appropriate ISO accreditation
standards, - be involved in commercial sales and market-
ing activities such as seminars and conferences with the
opportunity to present on project ndings, - be able to
take advantage of Illumina internal training programs
to gain a wider understanding of all Illumina-supported
applications, techniques and technologies.
To reect industry practice, a performance-dependent
annual supplement to the student stipend may be ne-
gotiated with Illumina after the rst year. Travel and
subsistence costs for attendance at and support of Illu-
mina sales and marketing events will also be met.

UOklahoma EvolutionaryGenomics
Graduate student positions are available in the De-
partment of Biology at the University of Okla-
homa. Research in the Broughton lab (http://-
www.biosurvey.ou.edu/dna/) involves a range of top-
ics in molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics.
We are increasingly interested in evolution of aerobic
metabolism pathways in relation to adaptation and
organismal performance. Specically, this includes in-
vestigation of how changes in oxidative phosphorylation
genes translate to dierences in oxphos function and how
functional variation may limit or facilitate evolution of
diverse energetic lifestyles. Because energy availability
has a major inuence on adaptation and life history,
aerobic metabolism may be an important driver of the
diversity of life. In addition, incompatibilities of oxphos
genes (e.g. mito-nuclear interactions) may inuence hy-
bridization and speciation. We focus primarily on shes
but are also involved with other animal groups. We
seek energetic and highly motivated individuals to join
our group. Successful applicants will have strong inter-
est (or experience) in several of the following: genomic
methodologies (particularly RNA-seq, transciptomics),
computational data analysis, high resolution respirome-
try and molecular evolutionary/phylogenetic analyses.

Application deadline: 11 January 2016
Project description (short, for a longer description please
follow link):
All organisms age and at rst glance this is an evolu-
tionary paradox. Why would organisms age if living
longer could increase Darwinian tness? Evolutionary
theory explains that extrinsic causes of death (e.g. harsh
weather) select for reproduction at the cost of somatic
maintenance, causing physiological ageing. Critically,
abrupt environmental change, e.g. global warming, will
modulate extrinsic mortality and optimal reproduction,
thereby vastly disrupting the selection pressures acting
on ageing. To understand such fundamental evolution-
ary processes and predict responses to environmental
change, we need to understand mechanism. To date,
however, we have little or no understanding of the mech-
anisms of ageing. The current project is a multidisci-
plinary approach to these questions, combining empirical
work, genomics and theoretical models.
We seek a hard-working passionate student with a quan-
titative mind-set and interest in ageing. Candidateswith a diverse life-science background will be consid-
ered. The broad scientic expertise of the supervisors
ensures a vibrant environment for the student. We will
empower the student to pursue his/her own interests
and acquire a wide array of skills. Your research will
not only have implications for how we understand a key
process in evolution, but also for biomedical science in
which ageing research is growing in importance.

EvolutionaryDiversication
Multiple Ph.D. positions in Evolutionary Diversication.
Ph.D. positions are available in the Dept. of Biolog-
ical Sciences at USC to join a collaborative project
on the evolutionary diversication of photosynthesis in
Cryptophytes. Cryptophytes are a widespread group of
algae that have a unique and unusually diverse class of
photosynthetic pigments (the cryptophyte phycobilins),
potentially allowing them to thrive in diverse light envi-
ronments. Their evolutionary history suggests frequent
shifts in the light spectra for which their pigments are
specialized. Furthermore, cryptophytes are the product
of an ancient secondary endosymbiosis, with nuclear
and mitochondrial genomes from an ancestral host, and
plastid and nucleomorph genomes from a red algal sym-
biont. Functional phycobilins require genes from both
ancestors, necessitating the evolution of intergenomic
cooperation.
Ph.D. candidates will join a project funded by the U.S.
National Science Foundation for ve years that is aimed
at linking variation of spectral irradiance to cryptophyte
diversity in environments from ponds to oceans. Ph.D.
projects may draw on eldwork, biogeography, phys-
iological experiments, phylogenomics, molecular evo-
lution, experimental evolution, comparative transcrip-
tomics, and/or phylogenetic comparative analyses. The
project is a collaboration between Dr. Tammi Richard-
son (richardson [at] biol.sc.edu) and Dr. Je Dudycha
(dudycha [at] biol.sc.edu). Prospective students may
contact either Richardson or Dudycha. We anticipate
at least one graduate student will join the Richardson
lab with a focus on physiological ecology, and at least
one graduate student will join the Dudycha lab with a
focus on evolutionary genetics. More information about

Microbe Wars: Exploring the Maintenance of Microbial
Diversity Using Articial Life
A PhD studentship in computational biology is available
at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.
Microbes are the most ubiquitous life form on Earth,
found everywhere from exotic locations - black smokers
on the ocean bottom - to the inside of every human's gut.
They are essential for nearly all life on the planet, driv-
ing nutrient cycling in the environment and contributing
to the health of plants and animals. Microbes are also
critical to industrial biotechnology, especially for fuel,
ne chemical and drug production. Thus, understanding
how microbial ecosystems are maintained is essential.
Evolutionary processes within microbial communities
appear fundamentally dierent than those at play in
macro-organisms, requiring specic understanding.
In this studentship, you will develop articial life simu-
lations to explore evolution and maintenance of biodi-
versity in microbial communities. You will use machine
learning and mathematical modelling to identify and
assess strategies leading to stable communities that also
maintain biodiversity. You will explore how communities
respond to perturbation, corresponding to phenomena
such as provision of antibiotics to a patient, and human
intervention in industrial and agricultural systems.
Your work will have applications in many areas. It is
increasingly clear that the microbial communities within
our bodies are key contributors to health: because the
benecial eects of these communities are in danger from
both antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, un-
derstanding how healthy biodiversity can be maintainedin the face of perturbation is essential. Maintenance
of soil microbial diversity is important for plant health,
and ultimately our food security. Microbial populations
in all contexts may share essential features of community
assembly, and this project will inform multiple topic
areas.
You will gain training in articial life simulations, genetic
algorithms, machine learning, game theory, microbial
genomics and metabolism, and mathematical modelling,
and will acquire a working knowledge of microbial com-
munities and their importance on our planet.
Your project will take place in St Andrews' Centre
for Biology Diversity (CBD) in the School of Biology,
and will be jointly supervised by Dr V Anne Smith
from the School of Biology, Dr John Mitchell from the
School of Chemistry, and Dr Leighton Pritchard from
the James Hutton Institute. All three groups work in
complementary areas of computational systems biology
and machine learning. For more information on their

NeuronalEvolution
The Senatore lab in the Department of Biology at Univer-
sity of Toronto Mississauga (http://senatorelab.com/)December 1, 2015 EvolDir 57
is currently recruiting 3 PhD and/or MSc students to
conduct research aimed at understanding diversity and
evolution of synaptic transmission. The anticipated
start date is May or September 2016.
In the lab, we compare what's known about synaptic
physiology and structure in mammalian and inverte-
brate model organisms, with two of the most early-
diverging animals: 1) Placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens,
a simple marine organism that exhibits motile behav-
iors including feeding, chemotaxis and phototaxis, yet
lacks neurons, muscle and synapses; and 2) the comb
jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi, from the most early-diverging
animal phylum Ctenophora, which appears to have
independently-evolved synapses.
We focus on i) voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels,
which in humans and invertebrates play crucial roles
in synaptic transmission, and on ii) synaptic protein
complexing mediated by scaolding proteins, which play
dynamic roles in synapse formation and homeostasis.
We are initiating comparative structure-function and
physiology studies of Cav channels, comparing human
and other invertebrate channels with highly divergent or-
thologues/homologues from Trichoplax and Mnemiopsis.
Here, objectives are to gain evolutionary insights into
the biophysical and pharmacological features of each
Cav channel type, and to determine whether the roles
that Cav channels play in Trichoplax and Mnemiopsis
resemble known synaptic functions of Cav channels in
other well-studied organisms. We are also applying high-
throughput proteomics to evaluate if key protein-protein
interactions that underlie synaptic scaolding, includ-
ing the association of Cav channels with pre-synaptic
exocytotic machinery, are absent/present in Trichoplax,
in accordance with its lack of synapses, and to dene
the molecular architecture of the independently-evolved
and poorly understood Mnemiopsis synapse. Students
wishing to join the lab should email their CV and the
names and contact information of 2 academic references

tions for two graduate student positions to work with
Prothonotary Warblers beginning April 2016.
One position is for a graduate research assistant who
will focus on migratory connectivity using population
genetics (co-advised by Drs. Dyer and Bulluck). This
position is a research assistantship with two years of
stipend and tuition in the Masters program at the Center
for Environmental Studies (http://ces.vcu.edu). Suc-
cessful applicants should have experience in molecular
techniques salient to creating ddRADseq libraries and
ornithological eld collection techniques. This individ-
ual will be working on exploring the extent to which
individuals sampled on wintering grounds can be as-
signed to specic breeding areas in North America as
well as assisting ongoing eld studies in this species in
Virginia.
The second position is a eld crew leader/potential grad-
uate student to lead eld work that addresses questions
about breeding density and habitat use (advised by
Dr. Bulluck). This position does not have funding for
student support outside of the eld season, however com-
petitive teaching assistantships including tuition and amonthly stipend may be available in the VCU Biology
MS program (http://biology.vcu.edu) for very strong
applicants. The eld crew leader will be responsible
for organizing and leading the eld eort from April
through July along with the eld technician and occa-
sional undergraduate technicians from VCU. Strongest
applicants will have a competitive GPA and GRE scores
and an interest in developing quantitative skills to an-
swer questions about Prothonotary Warbler breeding
ecology.
Both positions will involve eld work collecting demo-
graphic data on this species during the spring/summer
of 2016 and 2017. Field work will take place at Fort
A.P. Hill and surrounding areas, approximately mid-
way between Richmond and Washington D.C. A $1200-
1500/month stipend (depending on experience) and local
housing and transportation will be provided during the
eld season for both positions. Both positions require
prior experience in the eld, navigational skills, ability
to identify eastern birds by sight and sound, and toler-
ance for wet, hot, buggy coastal plain conditions in the
summer. Especially desirable skills include prior experi-
ence mist netting/banding of birds, collecting blood and
feather samples, and making detailed eld observations
using binoculars (including resighting color bands).
VCU, located in Richmond, VA, is the largest public
R1 University in Virginia and has an active and di-
verse Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Science
faculty that are engaged in research around the world.
Successful applicants should have a BS in biology (or
related eld), GPA >3.3, competitive GRE scores, an
interest in developing quantitative skills, a high level of
self-motivation, and prior research experience.
Interested persons should initially email a letter that
summarizes their background, educational goals, and
research interests, along with curriculum vitae (include
GPA and GRE scores) with contact information for three
references to Dr. Lesley Bulluck (lpbulluck@vcu.edu) or

Human Frontiers Postdoctoral Position @ Maree Lab:
Eco-Evo-Devo Multi-level Modelling of \Zombie Plants"
Traditionally biologists study organisms at separate lev-
els, with few studies linking mechanistic aspects of gene
function to the ecological niche of the organism and
the environment. In contrast, in this project we aim
to make causal connections between the gene function
within an organism and the impact of this gene function
on the pathogen distributions within whole countries.
Aster yellows phytoplasmas represent parasites that ex-
cel at controlling their plant hosts, dramatically modify-
ing their development, for example by forcing the plant
to form leaves instead of owers. Such modications in
the development not only aect the plant-parasite inter-
action, but also the interactions between the plant insect
vector, for example by increasing plant attractiveness
to the insects. Therefore, the plants developmentally
become \zombie", they cease to reproduce and allow for
the quicker spread of the disease.
Unravelling these complex interactions requires an eco-66 EvolDir December 1, 2015
evo-devo approach, in which the postdoc will develop a
multi-level model to zoom out from the molecular up to
the ecological level, to unravel the mechanisms by which
gene expression impacts development, changes pathogen,
vector and host interactions, and modies spread of the
disease over a whole country. By combining input from
molecular biology, developmental biology, and ecology,
a predictive model will be developed that links all these
levels.

undertake research in ways that increase both its sci-
entic and public appeal. The Curators must have the
vision and capability to build a research program that
can be integrated within the NHM's ongoing eorts to
document and interpret biotic responses to environmen-
tal change.
The ability to communicate eectively and engage with
a wide variety of audiences, including the public and the
NHM's various stakeholders is paramount. The success-
ful candidates will be expected to help oversee sta and
supervise the NHM's Rancho La Brea program includ-
ing the collections and excavations. They will actively
participate in a broad range of museum activities, such
as exhibits, education, outreach, training of educators,
public communications, and fundraising. More speci-
cally, the successful candidates will be expected to play
a key role in the ongoing transformation of the La Brea
Tar Pits & Museum, developing a future vision for this

Closing date 4 December 2015 Interviews 18 December
2015 This job is based in the Queen's University Marine
Laboratory, Portaferry, Northern Ireland
The idea: Fisheries stock assessments and the setting
of minimum landing sizes (MLS) critically depend on
robust age and size determinations, and understand-
ing the relationships of age/size with key life history
parameters such as maturity and fecundity. A funda-
mental problem with crustacean sheries management
is that carapace moulting destroys our ability to age in-
dividuals, leaving size as an unreliable estimator of age.
Crustacean sheries may be under- or over-exploited
until this problem is resolved. Here, we propose to test
and further develop a recently published technique to
measure crustacean age, involving detection and mea-
surement of internal eyestalk growth bands. This will be
achieved with our microtome/microscopy/digital imag-
ing facility, that will allow sectioning and digital im-
agery of eyestalks from samples of various crustacean
species across locations/habitats. Accurate age/size
relationships can thus be resolved and the data fed
into stock management and shery practice and pol-
icy. The project will be a collaboration with the shery
sector, through Whitby Seafoods, SeaFish the industry

Austin Hughes obituary
With heavy hearts, and on behalf of his former and
current trainees, we would like to inform our commu-
nity that Dr. Austin Leland Hughes, most recently a
Carolina Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences
at the University of South Carolina, passed away sud-
denly on October 31, 2015. Best known for his work
on the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and
overdominant selection, he went on to describe the com-
plexities of MHC evolution and also focused on the evo-
lution of the immune system, viral evolution and many
other topics. He co-authored over 300 peer-reviewed
publications and two books. His contributions to the
eld of evolutionary genetics are truly invaluable. We
will remember him for his razor-sharp mind, critical
thinking and erce loyalty to us and our careers.
Austin is survived by his wife, Andrea, children He-
len and Austin, stepsons Harry and Patrick, and nine
grandchildren.

Dear Colleague,
I am writing on behalf of the European Bioinformat-
ics Institute (EMBL-EBI) to request your support in
completing our annual survey: a series of 39 questions
about how you use bioinformatics databases, tools, and
resources. Your answers are important, as they help us
better understand how our resources are used.
If you are a laboratory scientist, or if you only rarely (or
never) use bioinformatics services, we still value your
input! The more users tell us about their experiences,
the better, so please feel free to forward this message to
your colleagues.
The survey will take 15{20 minutes to complete, and it
will close on Friday 29 November.

EvoHack
Dear Colleagues,
We apologize if you have received this e-mail multiple
times but we are trying to distribute it widely and thor-
oughly! Please feel free to pass it on to people you think
may be interested.
We are inviting you to apply for the inaugural iDiv Sci-
ence Hackathon (Groen and Calderhead, 2015, eLife).
This year's theme is EvoHack: Evolution and Adap-
tation. We have three highly motivated, innovative
young postdoctoral researchers leading teams in mod-
eling, molecular mechanisms and bioinformatics, and
phylogenetics and morphology. Have a look at their
proles on http://evohack.org/, where you will also nd
a video, the Groen and Calderhead reference, and more
information on the hackathon. We are now looking for
team members.
Please note: the team leads have suggested areas of
expertise they feel would be helpful for their projects,
but if you can make a case for your interest and po-
tential contribution, we will consider your application
regardless of your area of expertise. We aim for inter-
disciplinary teams.
What is EvoHack? Small groups, each comprising 4-
5 scientists from dierent disciplines, assembled based
on common interests and led by one motivated early-
career researcher, will spend 3 days intensively working
to solve a festering problem in evolution and adapta-
tion research. This might involve e.g. re-analyzing old
data in a new light, setting up a meta-analysis to test
an important hypothesis, designing a new or renovated
model, proposing a novel research structure or facility
to ll a gap, or designing a new method. At the end of
these 3 days, each team will have (1) a contribution to
upload to BioRxiv.org which will be (2) the basis for a
publication, grant proposal, or similar.
We invite applicants with diverse backgrounds, and in
all stages of their careers. We will select a total of up
to 13 researchers to join our three teams, based on par-
ticipants' and team leaders' common interests. Teams
will be organized beforehand, and some basic discus-
sion should already take place before the Hackathon,
but the magic (and the work) should happen during
the three Hackathon days. The Hackathon will take
place on December 4th-6th at Schloss Schkopau (http:/-/schlosshotel-schkopau.de/), immediately following the
iDiv conference.
The whole experience will cost a maximum of 30 Eur
per participant, thanks to funding from iDiv!
Who can join? We will consider applications from all
interested researchers, though preference may be given
to iDiv members because this is an iDiv-funded event.
How can I apply? Please apply as soon as possible { the
sooner we can organize teams, the sooner team members
and leads can start thinking and dreaming big! Go to
http://evohack.org/ and ll out the registration form.
In the area provided, please give us concise informa-
tion about your motivation, expertise, and potential
contributions. We will notify you about the status of
your registration and if we can oer you a spot at the
hackathon, we will suggest a team for you to join.
Thank you so much, and we look forward to engaging
in groundbreaking biodiversity science together!

Field Evolution Podcast
Hello,
Would you like to participate in an Art and Science
Evolution Podcast? Through funding from the Euro-
pean Society for Evolutionary Biology, we are creating
a podcast series about major themes of evolution.
It is very dicult for modern humans to simultaneously
grasp their insignicance in the evolutionary tree of
life, and their tremendous signicance with respect to
inuencing the course of evolution. This fundamental
misconception lies at the heart of what has led us to
the precipice of another mass extinction event on Earth.90 EvolDir December 1, 2015
Ode to Evolution is a ve episode podcast series, that
uses a storytelling approach to relate key concepts in
evolution. Each podcast will follow scientists exploring
evidence for evolution via examples of current research
in the eld of Evolutionary Biology, accompanied by 1-2
minute animated videos, and lesson plans for adapta-
tion in schools. Oering the public a deep perspective
of the scale of evolution and the human relationship
with life on earth, Ode to Evolution provides a valuable
perspective at a critical moment in history.
We are looking for volunteers, going to the eld in
the near future, that would be willing to take a sound
recorder (about the size of a pack of cards) with them.
We are asking volunteers to record sounds of the place
you do research and then answer 10 questions about
evolution from the eld. All in all, a time commitment
of about 30 minutes total.
If you're interested, please email us so we can give you
some more information and schedule you time with one
of our recording devices.

Genoscope France Internship
ZooplanktonGenomics
Genoscope is the French National Sequencing Cen-
ter, a research center specialized in the analysis of
genomes, and member of the Tara Oceans consor-
tium (http://oceans.taraexpeditions.org/en/). This
consortium published recently ve articles (http://-
www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/873.full) which
gave a rst insight into the biodiversity present in the
oceans through massive sequencing of metagenomics
samples. Although, the work accomplished improved sig-
nicantly our knowledge on marine genomics of viruses,
bacteria and protists, some organisms remain not in-
vestigated enough, especially those who belong to the
zooplankton which represent a large fraction of the ma-
rine biomass.
We propose a 6 month internship to a highly motivated
master student who wants to learn how to make bio-
logical sense out of high-throughput sequencing data
in a competitive bioinformatic environment. The rst
goal of the internship is to learn how to perform large
scale comparative genomic analysis of small zooplankton
genomes and especially on the genome of the copepod
Oithona nana. The student will identify the copepod
genes involved especially in the biological development
and in the response to environmental stresses. The
second objective is to integrate the Tara Oceans meta-
transcriptomic and metagenomics data to follow the
genomic diversity and the expression of the copepod
genes in the dierent samples already sequenced at the
Genoscope.
Required knowledge: genomics, biosynthesis pathways,December 1, 2015 EvolDir 91

Madrid StarlingCamp Volunteers
Ornithology volunteers seeked: Starling Camp 2016
Between April and June 2016 we will run our yearly in-
tensive research campaign in our starling colony, 50 kms
from Madrid. Around 250 nest boxes are almost daily
followed through the two sequential broods that most
nests obtain. Field work includes capturing adult birds
for measuring and sampling, follow-up of reproduction
(egg laying, hatching and edging), ringing nestlings,
setting-up of microchip readers to assess parental care...,
as well as other activities related to the specic experi-
ments running in each year.
The eld site is a pleasant and undisturbed woodland,
an hour from Madrid. Several researchers, PhDs and
master students take part in the eld work, but to be
able to run it properly, we count with the help of a few
volunteers every year. We provide free accommodation
for volunteers in a nearby eld station, transport to
and from the eld site, and a fantastic team-work at-
mosphere. We are happy to consider volunteers for any
periods of time starting from a minimum of 2 months.

Phyloseminar SandrinePavoine Dec8
Comparing patterns in phylogenetic and trait diversity
Sandrine Pavoine Mus eum National d'Histoire Naturelle,
Paris Tuesday, December 8, 2015, 8:00 AM PT
Studying the phylogeny led to the emergence of inter-
disciplinary approaches combining ecology, evolutionary
biology and biogeography. The analysis of the phyloge-
netic relatedness among species complemented the anal-
ysis of the functional (trait-based) similarities among92 EvolDir December 1, 2015
species, and even sometimes replaced it when phyloge-
netic relatedness was considered as a proxy for functional
similarity. The use of phylogenetic diversity as a proxy
for functional diversity as been questioned due to the
observation of moderate phylogenetic signal in many
eld studies. From a methodological viewpoint, a funda-
mental dierence between phylogenetic and functional
analyses is that phylogeny is intrinsically dependent
on a tree-like structure whereas trait data can, most
of time, only be forced to adhere a tree structure, not
without some loss of information. I will discuss the ways
phylogenetic and functional diversity patterns can be
compared and the consequences of their simultaneous
analyses for conservation and community ecology.

Questions Jackknifes
HomoplasyAdaptations
Dear Evoldir Listers:
Can a homoplasy be an innovation?
Background: Recently, I had a conversation with a col-
league re. evolutionary innovations in the context of
their potential associations with biodiversity. My rst
reaction was to say that, for the group in question, the
trait was an inferred synapomorphy after which a great
expansion of diversity can be documented. Yet, the
colleague argued that, for the group in question, a ho-
moplasy could also be an evolutionary innovation. Can
a homoplasy be an innovation?
If you have an answer, please feel free to email me di-
rectly (blayj@si.edu). If you know of a better list venue
to post this question, please do let me know.
Gratefully,

Dear Evoldir Listers:
Recently, I came across a paper that used jackknife
re-sampling methods for phylogenetics. Some branches
were supported >95%; others <95%, such as 89%
or 86%. Are these values to be treated akin to those
used in parametric stats, where typically >= 95% is
considered a cuto value of sorts?
If you have an answer, please feel free to email
me directly (blayj@si.edu). If you know of a more
biostatistically-oriented list, please do let me know so
that I may consider posting the question there as well.
Gratefully,

MajorUpdate
Dear all-
We announce the release of major updates to BAMM
and BAMMtools, a Bayesian framework for the anal-
ysis of speciation, extinction, and trait evolution on
phylogenetic trees. BAMM is available at http://-
bamm-project.org If you are currently using BAMM
and BAMMtools, we strongly recommend switching to
BAMMtools v 2.1 (now on CRAN) and BAMM v 2.5
(or higher), now on the project website. There are
signicant changes to the software, including several
important bug xes. There are also some changes to
the use of the software.
We have also added a comprehensive explanation of
the BAMM model, its assumptions, and the algo-
rithm used for computing the likelihood: http://bamm-
project.org/likelihoodmodel.html As we discuss, there
are several important assumptions and unresolved issues
involving the calculation of likelihoods for \rate shift"
models. These issues are common to all methods that
purport to compute the likelihood of phylogenetic trees
with rate shifts and non-zero extinction rates and are
not limited to BAMM. Several issues lack a clear theo-
retical resolution and we've agged them prominently
to hopefully inspire more attention from the community.
The new release of BAMMtools includes an R-based
likelihood calculator that computes the likelihood of
diversication shifts on phylogenetic trees exactly as im-
plemented in BAMM to enable users to compare BAMM
likelihoods to those from other software implementations.
We provide examples on the website showing how this
function can be used to test whether the BAMM likeli-
hood function is implemented correctly (http://bamm-
project.org/likelihoodmodel.html#testlikelihood).

SSB workshops are full-day events, but the structure
is exible and will be determined by the organizers.
For an example, see last year's workshop at http://-
2015nsfssbworkshop.weebly.com/schedule.html. Topics
may include any area related to systematics. The society
is particularly interested in workshops that cover new
theories or methods in the eld and that lead to broader
participation in systematics. We encourage the inclusion
of a diverse group of speakers from multiple career stages.
**$4000** in funds will be provided to support the par-
ticipation of workshop organizers/presenters. The venue
will accommodate up to 60 participants.
The deadline for full consideration is December 1st,
2015. Proposals should be emailed (Word or PDF for-
mat) to the Program Chairperson, Stacey D. Smith,

Postdoc: termite protist evolution
The Gile Lab in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona
State University seeks a Postdoctoral Researcher to
study the diversity and evolution of microbial eukary-
otes from termite hindguts. The termite-protist diges-
tion symbiosis began in an ancient ancestor of termites
and has persisted over 175 million years to the present
day. In that time, several lineages of protists have diver-
sied and become large and morphologically complex.
The overall evolutionary pattern of the symbiosis is of
vertical inheritance punctuated by occasional lateral
transfers of protists, with protists out-speciating their
hosts by approximately 5:1. We are interested in evo-
lutionary rates, speciation, morphological convergence,
and instances of lateral transfer of symbionts among
termite host species. Research duties may include, but
are not limited to, eld collection, metagenomic and
community-wide amplicon sample preparation for se-
quencing, assembly and analysis of next-generation se-
quence data, p hylogenetic analysis, and biochemical
pathway analysis. Opportunities will be provided for
conference travel and networking.
Applicants must have a PhD in biology, microbiology,
ecology, or other relevant discipline, excellent communi-
cation and interpersonal skills, and a strong publication
record. Candidates with bioinformatics skills and ex-
pertise in microbial community analysis, phylogenetics,
or population genetics are preferred. The fellowship
duration will be three years, contingent on satisfactory
performance (assessed yearly) and continued availability
of funds. Interested applicants should provide a brief
(one page) cover letter, CV, and three letters of support
sent directly from referees. Send application materials

Postdoc position
Origin of insect metamorphosis: dissection and evolution
of the metamorphic gene toolkit
Our research objective:
Insects have undergone radical evolution in their de-
velopment since their origination from arthropod an-
cestors, such that three types of metamorphosis have
emerged: ametaboly, hemimetaboly and holometaboly.
These three forms of metamorphosis represent an evolv-
ing sequence from the primitive ametabolous (direct-
developing) to hemimetabolous (incomplete metamor-
phosis) to the most derived holometabolous type of meta-
morphosis (complete metamorphosis). Unfortunately,
the nature of the changes underlying the appearance
of Holometaboly remains a puzzling problem in evolu-
tionary and developmental biology. To this aim, the
main goal of the EvolMeT project is to characterize the
molecular mechanisms underlying the origin of complete
holometabolan metamorphosis.
Eligibility
The successful applicant will hold a PhD in the biolog-
ical sciences with a strong background in Drosophila
genetics, and/or developmental biology. A proven ex-
perience in molecular biology, and genetics is essential.
Microscopy techniques are desirable although not essen-
tial. We are looking for highly motivated applicants that
feel comfortable undertaking the challenges of learning
new experimental techniques. You must have excellent
scientic communication, presentation and writing skills,
as well as very good critical and analytical problem solv-

We are looking to hire four researchers with a back-
ground in machine learning, bioinformatics of genomic
and molecular data, and/or statistical genetics. Strong
skills in computer programming and modeling are nec-
essary. Researchers with experience in human, animal,
and other model organisms and evolution are especially
encouraged to apply.
Join Ed Buckler and his group at Cornell University and
help develop models based in genomics, molecular biol-
ogy, and large-scale eld evaluations to predict tness
consequences of mutations. We have a history of bridg-
ing quantitative genetics and genomics and applying
this knowledge to improving crops with the aim of reduc-
ing hunger and environmental impact. Crop genomics
is at a key moment, where the technologies to design
crops have never been more powerful (genomic selec-
tion and genome editing). However, to eectively apply
these technologies, we must rst improve our capacity to
predict the functional consequences of deleterious and
adaptive alleles so that candidates can be developed.
We are looking for researchers wanting to tackle these
important problems.
The four specic eorts we are focused on are: (1) Basic
research to identify the deleterious mutations in the
maize genome. This research will help address the basis
of dosage, heterosis, and crop yield. (2) Developing
genomic breeding models and compare the genetic archi-
tecture of the maize, wheat, rice, chickpea, and sorghum.
These models will be used to by global breeding eorts
in the developing world. (3) Developing system based
models in Sorghum that integrate genetic variation and
detailed physiology. (4) Data mining to prediction adap-
tive and deleterious mutations in cassava - a key crop
for food security in Africa.

Breeding system variations in vertebrates: the signi-
cance of adult sex ratio
To continue a successful research programme on sex ra-
tios, mating systems and parental care, we are recruiting
a post-doctoral researcher and a PhD student. Both
positions are available from 1 January 2016 and will be
funded for 3 years. The project is based at Debrecen
University, Hungary (http://www.unideb.hu/portal/en).
The positions are funded by the Hungarian ScienticResearch Fund (OTKA).
PROJECT SUMMARY The evolution and diversity of
breeding systems are among the most fascinating as-
pects of behavioural biology. During the last couple of
years, our group has discovered that mating system and
parental care are inuenced by adult sex ratio (ASR or
tertiary sex ratio, the proportion of males in the adult
population) in birds: the rarer sex in the population
has more favourable mating opportunities (and more
reluctant to provide care) than the more common sex.
In this new project we are looking to continue this suc-
cessful line of research and extend it to vertebrates in
general, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians and
shes. We will focus on major questions in an explicit
phylogenetic framework, by using phylogenetic compara-
tive analyses based on data in the literature. We expect
that the analyses, which will cover over 500 million years
of evolutionary history, will reveal fundamentally novel
patterns underlying the ecological, demographic and ge-
nomic causes of ASR variation, as well as elucidate the
relationship between ASR, mating systems and parental
care evolution across vertebrates. This project will have
implications for evolutionary biology, population demog-
raphy and conservation biology, and may serve as a
benchmark for understanding ASR variation in humans.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS Prof Tamas Szekely
(University of Bath, UK), Prof Andras Liker (Pannonia
University, Hungary), Prof Zoltan Barta (Debrecen
University) & Prof Robert F Freckleton (University
of Sheeld, UK). The project will be based at the Dept
of Evolutionary Zoology, Debrecen University (http://-
zoology.unideb.hu/home/).
RESPONSIBILITIES POST-DOC. The post-doc will
carry out the major analysis and write publications
on some of the main issues targeted by the project.
We are seeking candidates with a PhD in evolutionary
biology, behavioural ecology or population biology, ex-
cellent quantitative skills and ability to programme in
R. Previous experience in phylogenetic and/or compar-
ative analyses is advantageous but not essential. The
post-doc will also oversee the PhD student's work on a
daily basis, and coordinate data collection for the whole
projects. His/her major tasks will include preparing

*A two-year postdoctoral position in molecular plant
pathology at INRA** **Angers, France*
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position to
study molecular determinants underlying adaptation of
pathogenic fungi to their host plants, in the EcoFun
team of the Horticulture and Seed Research Institute
(IRHS). Our lab conducts research on the interaction be-
tween the scab fungus Venturia inaequalis and its host
plants, including domesticated and wild apple trees,
and rethorn. Host shifts between these hosts have
been reported, making this pathosystem an adequate
model to identify genes involved in fungal adaptation
to dierent host plants. The research will employ in-
terdisciplinary approaches, including molecular biology,
microscopy and RNA-seq analyses. The rst task of this
position will be to take ownership of population genomic
resequencing data to identify genes present in isolates
that are pathogenic on a single host only. The second
task will be to determine at which stages of the infec-
tion process genes involved in adaptation to dierent
host plants are expressed, using confocal and MEB mi-
croscopy of incompatible interactions. This knowledge
will be used in a third task to harvest infected leaves for
deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and identify
genes that are specically expressed on a given host.
The successful candidate is also expected to contribute
to the writing of research publications and to help with
student supervision.
*Job requirements* Candidates should have or expected
to obtain a PhD in Biology, Molecular Biology, Func-
tional Genomics, or a closely related subject. Skills in
Next Generation Sequencing data analysis are highly
desirable. Candidates with a PhD in Bioinformatics are

practical knowledge in molecular biology, microscopy
and bioinformatics are advantageous. Candidates must
have prociency in oral and written English. This posi-
tion is available for non-French citizens only.104 EvolDir December 1, 2015
*Job details* The position is full-time for 24 months
and is available to start as early as 1st January 2016.
Basic gross salary on appointment will be between 2,200

AmazonianBiogeographicAnalysis
We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to contribute to the
project \Dimensions US / Biota S ~A$o Paulo - Assembly
and evolution of the Amazonian biota and its environ-
ment: an integrated approach", co-funded by the S ~A$o
Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, Brazil), the Na-
tional Science Foundation (NSF, USA), and NASA.
The Amazon is Earth's most iconic center of biological
diversity and endemism, harboring the world's largest
freshwater ecosystem, and contributing substantially
to shaping the Earth's climate. Despite this impor-
tance, we still have an incomplete understanding of how
this biome developed over time, which in turn limits
our ability to understand future impacts of biodiversity
loss and climate change. The project \Dimensions US
- Biota S ~A$o Paulo: Assembly and evolution of the
Amazonian biota and its environment: an integrated
approach" seeks to understand the evolutionary and
environmental-ecological history of Amazonia over the
past 10 million years, through a comparative approach
integrating systematic biology and phylogenetics, phylo-
geography, population genetics, ecosystem structure and
function, geosciences, and paleoenvironmental history.110 EvolDir December 1, 2015

to have experience in analyzing genomic data, particu-
larly data obtained with ultraconserved elements (UCE)
probes, but should have a good understanding of other
types of NGS data. A track record of publication in
international journals and relevant statistical and pro-
gramming skills are expected. The appointee will ana-
lyze population genomic datasets of Amazonian birds
and primates; address biogeographic questions and test
hypotheses of the assembly and evolution of Amazonian
biota; interact with Earth scientists to interpret bio-
geographic patterns and processes, and to disseminate
their ndings by publishing in internationally renowned
journals and presenting in scientic conferences. The
results of these analyses will have a major impact on the
interpretation of the evolutionary history of the Amazon
Basin.
Particulars of the position:
The fellowship will start in February/March 2016 and
last until August 2017 (19 months), with possible re-
newal for another 5 months. The appointee will be
based at Dr. Diogo Meyer's lab (S ~A$o Paulo University

We are seeking to appoint a Post-Doctoral Fellow to
work on a three-year project on \Ecological Immuno-
genetics and Behavioral Responses to Disease" funded
by the National Research Foundation of Korea.
This project addresses the interaction of disease, adap-
tive immune function,and the evolution of behavioral
strategies to eectively respond to emerging infectious
pathogens. Recent data show that amphibians can
rapidly evolve immunogenetic defenses to pathogens,
such as the amphibian chytrid fungus. However, these
adaptations potentially entail life-history costs that oth-
erwise decrease tness. The project examines from
an integrative perspective how immune system genes,
through the interaction of major histocompatibility com-
plex molecules and their regulation of microbial assem-
blages, produce social signals that enable individuals to
recognize genetically compatible partners. The research
further assesses the tness consequences of mate choice
under dierent conditions of disease prevalence.
The research involves collaboration between the School
of Biological Sciences and the College of Veterinary
Medicine at Seoul National University. The successful
candidate will have ample opportunities to interact with
colleagues both within Korea and with our international
collaborators in Australia, Panama,the United Kingdom,
and the United States.
Experience in molecular biology with a strong interest
in evolution is desirable. Research will be conducted in
well-equipped, modern laboratory facilities.
Seoul National University is one of the leading universi-
ties in Asia and ranks internationally 31st overall and

PlantHerbivorePollinator
Interactions
Postdoc in Plant-Herbivore-Pollinator interactions:
Does plant resistance improve pollination at the popu-
lation level?
Herbivore-damaged strawberry plants deter pollinators,
leading to reduced pollination success. However, wild
strawberry (Fragaria vesca) genotypes dier in their
resistance against herbivores. The importance of plant
resistance has previously been tested in a mixed com-
mon garden where herbivores as well as pollinators are
free to interact with resistant or susceptible plants. Such
experimental 'cafeteria situations' are, however, quite
dierent from wild populations and commercial planta-
tions where plant-genetic variation within a site typically
is lower.
The aim of this postdoc project is to investi-
gate how plant resistance against herbivores af-
fects plant-herbivore-pollinator interactions at the
population level. Experimental all-resistant and
all-susceptible plantations were established for this
purpose in 2015. Please nd the online ad

DESCRIPTION
We are seeking a highly motivated researcher to join the
avian DNA research group at the Swedish Museum of
Natural History (SMNH) in Stockholm. The objective
of our research program is to investigate the evolution-
ary history of birds using comparative genomics. The
principal task for the postdoc/researcher is to lead the
analyses of the NGS data. The position is for two years.
We are currently generating and analyzing genome data
in several projects. One of these concerns the birds-
of-paradise. Besides clarifying their phylogenetic re-
lationships we also want to identify genomic regions
of dierentiation to explore to what extent these are
related to dierent sexually selected traits in the birds-
of-paradise. Another aim is to examine the importance
of gene ow in the speciation process, as well as to
what extent adaptive introgression has contributed to
the evolution of homoplastic phenotypic traits. Our
aim is to sequence the genomes of all ca 100 described
species and subspecies of birds-of-paradise. So far we
have sequenced and assembled ve de novo genomes (at
80-100X coverage) and re-sequenced the genomes of the
remaining 34 species (at 15-25X coverage)
ENVIRONMENT
The position will be based at the Department of Bioinfor-
matics and Genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural
History (NRM). The museum is located in Stockholm,
which by many is regarded as one of the most beautiful

avian systematics and biogeography (PI: Dr. Martin
Irestedt), ancient DNA and population genetics (PI:
Dr. Love Dal en), and phylogenomics (PI: Prof. Fredrik
Ronquist).
QUALIFICATIONS
The ideal candidate is a creative and independent re-
searcher, who by the start of the project has obtained
a PhD in biology or a related eld. A record of scien-
tic achievement in bioinformatics and computational
genomics is essential, as is previous experience in han-
dling NGS data using scripts and analysis pipelines.
Additional merits include experience in computer pro-
gramming, phylogenetics, selection scans, as well as
prociency in genome assembly and annotation.
The start date of the position is exible, but should be
no later than July 1, 2016. The position is for two years
full-time and the employment will either be as Postdoc
or Researcher, depending on whether the applicant was
awarded his/her PhD degree less or more than three
years before the application deadline.

Adaptive evolution of stress responses in the genus Ara-
bidopsis Lab. J. de Meaux - Cologne
The University of Cologne invites applications from mo-
tivated and committed candidates for a postdoc position
in the research group of Prof. Juliette de Meaux in the
faculty of Natural Sciences.
A signicant part of adaptation occurs by the accumula-
tion of small eect mutations, which cannot be tracked
individually but have to be analyzed collectively at the
system level. Research in the de Meaux lab intends to
understand whether the collective molecular activity of
cis-acting mutations can reveal novel insight into the
molecular biology of adaptation. Time-dependent data
of transcriptomic, metabolic and phenotypic data in
response to applied stresses will be used to reconstruct
how cis-acting changes modify cellular and metabolic
phenotypes. Because our data examines phenotypically
divergent populations, we hope to disentangle the impact
of neutral vs. selective evolutionary forces on cellular
modications. The postdoctoral research associate will
design analytical strategy to describe the evolution of
gene network and evaluate the impact of selective forces.
He will work in collaboration with our international
team
The applicant must hold a PhD in Evolutionary Biol-
ogy (Comparative Genomics, Evolutionary Genetics or
Population genetics) and hold advanced skills in bioin-
formatic programming. Language in the lab is English.
Applications or questions regarding the position should
be sent by mail to jdemeaux@uni-koeln.de, with the
following subject line: - Postdoc application adaptation

vation, a CV and the contact of 3 referees should be
provided, all in a single pdf le. Revision of applications
will begin in Nov. 21, 2015 and continue until the posi-
tion is lled. Funding is for one to four years starting
in Spring 2016 (exible starting date). For more infor-
mation on our lab and research visit our website http:/-

Closing date: 2015-12-01
A collaborative project between the research groups of
Kerstin Johannesson and Roger Butlin are currently
generating massive sets of genetic and phenotypic data
in order to increase our understanding of the molec-
ular mechanisms of local adaptation and evolution of
reproductive isolation under gene ow.
We have phenotypic and genotypic data covering 3000
snails distributed over 4 contact zones of two ecotypes
including exact positions, measurements of morphology
and behaviour and are now generating individual
genotype data using capture DNA sequencing. We are
also generating pool-seq data from populations of the
two L. saxatilis ecotypes from several dierent countries,
in addition to samples of nearby species/subspecies.
In addition, we are generating genotype data and
morphological data for comprehensive analysis of
quantitative traits (QTL mapping) deriving from
F2 and F3 generations bred from crosses between
the two ecotypes. There are also several dierent
transcriptomes generated from separate tissues of the
species. Simultaneously, we are making progress with
the genome assembly of Littorina saxatilis and we
expect a nal draft assembly to be nished by the

Ecological genomics: Analysis of gene expression under-
lying parallel habitat adaptation in distinct salamander
species
Abstract In a continuously changing world, adaptation
to new or altering environmental conditions is one of
the most elementary and important biological processes.
Although we have much data on the consequences of
habitat adaptation at the phenotypic and population
structure levels, we are currently missing, with a few
exceptions, deeper insights into the genetic architecture
of habitat-dependent adaptation. The study of parallel
adaptive evolution can illuminate underlying processes
and mechanisms. Unlike any other vertebrate group,
amphibian species can show a fascinating breadth of
habitat-specic adaptations to aquatic and terrestrialhabitats. The research teams of this proposal have stud-
ied parallel ecological adaptation to larval reproductive
habitats in two distinct species of re salamanders -
Salamandra salamandra in Germany and Salamandra
infraimmaculata in Israel. By integrating a strong eco-
logical context with genomic approaches, this research
proposal aims at extending the ecological-genetic frame-
work of parallel habitat adaptation to the level of the
transcriptome in order to simultaneously screen a large
number of genes for patterns of evolutionary divergence.
We will design species-specic oligonucleotide microar-
rays based on EST sequences of the larval transcrip-
tomes for each species. These microarrays can then be
used to analyze gene expression patterns under fully
natural conditions and in experimental setups, whereby
analyses are inspired by eld studies that analyze the
ecology of salamander larvae. As salamander larvae are
accessible in large numbers and can be easily manipu-
lated in common environment experiments, this study
system is suited to explore gene-expression responses to
habitat-specic cues or selection pressures in dedicated
experiments reecting distinct larval habitat types and
ecological parameters. The resulting data will reveal
whether plastic phenotypes contribute to adaptive phe-
notypic change and whether they are enhanced by the
emergence of genetically xed traits. In addition to tra-
ditional computational methods, we shall use a newly
developed individual-centered approach, using a new
vector-correlation measure to identify genes that are
co-expressed in individuals as opposed to dierential
expression of genes across populations.

Uppsala 3 MolecularEvolution
Post-doctoral position in molecular evolution
Three two-year post-doctoral positions are available
in the Ellegren lab at the Evolutionary Biology Cen-
tre, Uppsala University, Sweden (http://www.ieg.uu.se/-
evolutionsbiologi/ellegren-se/?languageId=1). Two po-
sitions are broadly dened as population genomics and
one as molecular evolution (presented below), although
there is some extent of overlap both in terms of concepts
and data used among the positions.
We are interested in how sequence evolution and evolu-
tion of base-composition are related to factors such as
epigenetic modications, life history and recombination.
Avian genomes are in focus for our research (allowing
analyses of highly heterogeneous recombination land-
scapes) and we perform whole-genome re-sequencing of
population samples to obtain detailed estimates of the
site-frequency spectrum. Examples of on-going work
are studies of methylation in avian genomes based on
whole-genome bisulte sequencing and how methylation
aects substitution patterns and gene expression, how
GC-biased gene conversion give genomic signals mim-
icking those of selection (and how signals of gBGC and
selection can be separated), and the link between life
history and rates of diversity/divergence. The specic
questions to be addressed will be decided in dialogue
with the successful candidate and will depend on her/his
interests and background.
Recent publications from the group relating to the
project include Weber et al 2014 Genome Biology 15:542
and 15:549; Mugal et al 2015 G3 5:441-447; Smeds et
al 2015 Nature Communications 6:7330; Uebbing et al
2015 Mol Biol Evol, in press.
Suitable background to this position is a PhD geared to-ward molecular evolution, population genetics, or bioin-
formatics. Experience from bioinformatic analyses of
next-generation sequencing data is of merit.
Start date is exible, ideally before January 1, 2016.
The position can be extended for up to two more years.
For full consideration, please send application materials
by September 18, 2015. Interested candidates should
submit the following to Hans.Ellegren@ebc.uu.se - a
cover letter stating research interests, - CV, including
publication record - a short (1-2 page) description of
research accomplishments, - email addresses and phone
numbers of three references Please feel free to contact

TIME SERIS MODELS FOR ECOLOGISTS AND CLI-
MATOLOGISTS
This course is being delivered by Dr Andrew Parnell, It
will run from 9th - 12th of May 2016 at SCENE (the
Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environ-
ment), Loch Lomond National Park, Glasgow.
Course overview: This course will cover model-based
time series analysis with a particular focus on applica-
tions in ecology and climatology. All methods will be
illustrated using the free, open-source software package
R. Time Series data are ubiquitous in the physical sci-
ences, and models for their behaviour enable scientists
to understand temporal dynamics and predict future
values. Participants will be taught a wide range of
suitable time series models for both discrete and con-
tinuous time systems. The course takes a foundational
Bayesian approach, which will enable participants to
have a deeper understanding of the models being tted,
and to estimate all unknown quantities with uncertainty.
Participants are encouraged to bring their own data sets
for discussion with the course tutors.
This workshop is aimed at research postgraduates, prac-
ticing academics in ecology, climatology, evolution, me-
teorology, conservation and environmental management,
and environmental professionals in government and in-
dustry.
The workshop is delivered over 8 half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). The session will consist
of Introductory lectures on the concepts and refreshers
on R usage. Intermediate-level lectures interspersed with
hands-on mini practicals and longer projects. Finally,
round-table discussions about the analysis requirements
of attendees (optional - bring your own data).
Assumed background: A basic understanding of statis-
tical concepts. Such as regression modelling and gener-
alised linear models. Some understanding of Bayesian
Statistics is recommended but will be covered during
the introductory sessions. Familiarity with R. Ability to
import/export data, manipulate data frames, t basic
statistical models & generate simple exploratory and
diagnostic plots.

Seattle SymposiumShortCourse
Nov22
As part of the 5th Seattle Symposium in Biostatistics, I
will be oering a short course \Overview of Omics Data"
on Sunday November 22.
Symposium and short course details at http://-
symposium.biostat.washington.edu Overview of Omics
Data Sunday, November 22nd, 2015 8:30 am 12:00 pm
Biomedical science is being changed by the rapid in-
troduction of large-scale omic data. In the genomics
area, whole-genome SNP data have been used widely
in disease association studies and are now being aug-
mented by whole-genome sequence data. The benets
of collecting complete genetic data for large numbers
of individuals are at least matched by the statistical
challenges of addressing complex methods of generating
data and the resulting noise in the data. This course
will review data types and initial steps to prepare data
for analysis.

Feb28-Mar5
Reminder for the Winter School of Bioinformatics for
Adaptation Genomics (B@G2016). The registration
deadline is approaching fast. Applications need to be
submitted by November 15th 2015.
Winter School - Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics
(B@G 2016) VENUE: Alexander & Gerbi Hotel, Weggis,
Switzerland DATE: February 28th - March 5th 2016
The most up-to-date information is available here:
http://www.adaptation.ethz.ch/education/winter-
school-2016.html AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The
application of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies to non-model organisms is now well-
established and has unlocked new frontiers for research
on adaptation genomics. Despite recent technological
developments enabling an increasing number of projects
to use genome-scale data, the analysis of such complex
data sets still raises substantial analytical hurdles,
particularly for researchers with primarily an ecological
and evolutionary background. Bioinformatic pipelines
oer an invaluable resource to process genomic data,
but their underlying rationale often remains hard
to understand, which poses signicant challenges
for their rigorous use and accurate interpretation of
the results. The B@G Winter School provides an
opportunity for researchers to penetrate the 'black
box' behind the complex bioinformatics approaches
available for investigating adaptation genomics; from
the programs and assumptions necessary to produce
a high quality SNP dataset from raw NGS data, to
the in-depth interpretation of methods designed to
detect signature of selection, demographic patterns
and associations between genotypes and environment,
and/or phenotypes. B@G teachers are established
scientists with a primary role in the development of
widely used bioinformatic software. Consequently,
participants of the B@G Winter School will gain insight
into the foundations of these algorithms and what they
do to the data, and will also receive advices on bestpractice in experimental design and analysis.
AUDIENCE The School is primarily aimed at evolution-
ary biologists who want to gain deeper knowledge on
state-of-the-art methods used to detect evolutionary pat-
terns from genome-wide nucleotide data. Applications
from early career researchers (PhD and post-doctoral
level), as well as faculty with a background in ecology,
evolution or genetics, will be considered. The workshop
is particularly aimed at candidates with experience of
the Unix environment and who have tried using bioinfor-
matic pipelines to analyse genomic data. Participants
will be requested to bring their own laptop with which
to connect to the server for the practical sessions.
Lessons will include lectures on the theoretical back-
ground of the programs and practical demonstrations
given by the instructor, followed by hands-on exercises
performed by the participants under guided supervision.
Computing activity will rely on individual connections
to the Genetic Diversity Centre (GDC, ETH Zurich)
server, which will provide resources for demonstrations
and practical training. Emphasis will be given to in-
terpreting the output of the programs, with time for
discussion to facilitate interactions between the instruc-
tor and the audience.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch). Weggis is a scenic town lo-
cated on the shore of Lake Lucerne in central Switzer-
land. The location was chosen to provide a friendly and
stimulating work environment. The area is known for
its relaxing character and peaceful mountain scenery.
COST Total fee for participants is 750.- CHF. This in-
cludes tuition and accommodation in double rooms with
full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
at the Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop.
Accommodation in single rooms may be available upon
request and with additional costs.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. AlthoughDecember 1, 2015 EvolDir 141
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
