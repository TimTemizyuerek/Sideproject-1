FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PA-
PERS
Fisheries Society of the British Isles Annual Symposium
Parasites as Agents of Selection in Fish: from Genes to
Ecosystems
Cardiﬀ University, Wales, UK, 21-25 July 2008
Parasites are increasingly recognised by biologists as
important mediators of ecological interactions and
agents of natural and sexual selection in host popu-
lations. Fish serve as hosts to a wide range of ’con-
ventional’ parasitic organisms (i.e. agents of diseaseOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 3
such as viruses, fungi, lice and worms), and have proven
to be extremely good models for testing key hypothe-
ses in lab and ﬁeld research. Furthermore, invest-
ment in courtship and parental behaviour risks para-
sitism by conspeciﬁcs that engage in ’sneaky’ mating
tactics. There is currently considerable interest in the
impacts of both ’conventional’ heterospeciﬁc parasites,
and conspeciﬁc ’cuckoos’ on the ﬁtness of host individ-
uals and the consequences of parasitism for populations
and communities. This meeting will examine how par-
asites impact the biology of ﬁsh at all organisational
levels - from the gene to the ecosystem - and in doing
so will addresses some of the most relevant and pressing
research themes in parasitology, behaviour and evolu-
tionary ecology.
We expect to hold sessions based around the following
major themes:
Parasites, genes and evolution: detection and avoid-
ance of infective agents; host-parasite co-evolution; im-
mune genes and parasite infection; virulence and local
adaptation in host-parasite interactions. Fitness con-
sequences of infections: eﬀects on host physiology, be-
haviour, growth and development; parasites and sexual
selection in ﬁsh; pathology of infection. Ecological im-
plications of parasitism: population, community and
ecosystem consequences of parasite infections; brood
parasitism in ﬁsh; the ecology and evolution of cleaner
ﬁsh symbioses. Host-parasite interactions in altered en-
vironments: impacts of climate change, habitat degra-
dation and aquatic pollutants on host-parasite interac-
tions; the implications of species introductions for host-
parasite interactions in ﬁsh.
Conﬁrmed invited speakers include Kevin Laﬀerty
(Ecosystem consequences of ﬁsh parasites), Lexa Grut-
ter (Ecology and evolution of cleaning symbioses in
ﬁsh), Steve Feist (Pathology of ﬁsh parasite infections),
Mathias Wegner (The role of Mhc genes in host-parasite
interactions) and Bernd Sures (Host-parasite interac-
tionas in polluted environments).
Potential contributors should indicate their interest in
presenting a paper and/or poster by submitting a ti-
tle and abstract (up to 250 words) by e-mail attach-
ment (preferably in a Word document) to the con-
ference coordinator, Tricia Ellis-Evans (e-mail: tri-
cia@paceprojects.co.uk) by 1st November 2007. Fur-
ther details regarding the conference venue, registra-
tion and abstract submission are available on the con-
ference website http://www.fsbi.org.uk/2008 . We look
forward to welcoming you to Cardiﬀ in July 2008.

Dear Colleague:
This is to invite you to attend an Arthur M. Sackler
colloquium, In the Light of Evolution II: Biodi-
versity and Extinction, sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences. The Colloquium will be
December 6-8, 2007, at the Beckman Center of
the National Academies of Sciences and Engineer-
ing in Irvine, California. A preliminary program
can be viewed at <http://www.nasonline.org/-
Sackler biodiversity program >www.nasonline.org/-
Sackler biodiversity program . Darwin’s experience as
a natural historian contributed greatly to his expla-
nation of evolution by natural selection, which stands
as one of the grand intellectual achievements in the
history of science. The Earth’s exuberant biodiversity
is a wellspring for scientiﬁc curiosity and discovery
about nature’s workings. Bringing together leading
researchers and students interested in biodiversity
from evolutionary as well as ecological perspectives,
this colloquium seeks to synthesize recent discoveries
and concepts regarding the global abundance and
distribution of biodiversity, and to compare the biodi-
versity patterns to conditions in the near and distant
evolutionary past, as well as to those plausible in the
near-term future.
Attendance at the Colloquium is limited to 250 reg-
istered individuals. To facilitate the participation of
younger scientists, we request that you extend this in-
vitation to interested graduate students and postdocs.
The NAS has provided funds to supplement the ex-
penses of participating graduate students and postdocs
up to $125 for hotel costs and up to $300 for air travel.
Awards will be granted with priority based exclusively
on the order in which requests (accompanied by the
registration fee) are received. Notiﬁcation of the award
will be made shortly after receiving the application but
the awards will be paid after the Colloquium, upon doc-
umentation of qualifying expenses.
Please register on the NAS web-
site <http://www.nasonline.org/-
Sackler biodiversity >www.nasonline.org/-Sackler biodiversity . Registrations will be accepted
only when the registration fee is included and in the
order in which they are received. The registration fee
is $350, which includes the cost of meals, reception,
and banquet. However, an early registration fee of
$250 (also including meals, reception, and banquet) is
available to those posting their registration by Novem-
ber 1, 2007. A reduced all-inclusive registration fee
of $150 is oﬀered to Graduate Students and Postdocs
who register by November 1, 2007.
After submitting your online registration form and pay-
ment, you will receive an email conﬁrmation including
details for reserving a room at the Hyatt Regency New-
port Beach at the discounted rate of $118 per night.
Please do not call the hotel directly for room reserva-
tions as the discounted rate is only available through
the Academy’s travel agency. After November 1, 2006,
we cannot guarantee that a hotel room will be available.
Shuttle bus service between the hotel and the Beckman
Center will be provided free of charge at speciﬁed times.

SYMPATRIC SPECIATION ON AN OCEANIC IS-

AVAILABLE NOW!
PhD Studentship ¨ ı¿1
2Imperial College London
Location: Imperial College at Silwood Park Campus,
Ascot
Eligibility: See NERC eligibility (restricted to UK
residents/citizens) http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/-
application/studentships/ Supervision: Dr Vincent
Savolainen (Imperial College London & Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew), in collaboration with Dr Bill Baker
(Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew), Dr Tim Barraclough
(Imperial College), Dr Darren Crayn (Royal Botanic
Garden, Sydney), and Mr Ian Hutton (Lord Howe
Island)
The origin of species diversity has challenged biolo-
gists for over two centuries. Charles Darwin recognized
that allopatry, species divergence resulting from geo-
graphical isolation, is a driving force of speciation, but
he also thought populations could diverge into sepa-
rate species in the absence of geographical isolation, a
mechanism now called sympatric speciation. Last year,
Savolainen and colleagues provided complete evidence
for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species
of palm (Howea) on a remote oceanic island, Lord Howe
Island (LHI), Australia (Savolainen & al. 2006. Sym-
patric speciation in palms on an oceanic island. Nature
441: 210-2133). Nature¨ ı¿1
2s own coverage of this paper
claimed that ¨ ı¿1
2[Lord Howe] Island hosts double boost
for evolutionary theory¨ ı¿1
2and that experts say ¨ ı¿1
2the
big question now is whether sympatric speciation is
widespread or rare¨ ı¿1
2. Here the investigation will be
broadened to other vascular plants of LHI with the aim
to evaluate whether this evolutionary phenomenon is
more common than previously thought.
LHI is a minute subtropical island of less than 12 km2,
situated 580 km oﬀ the eastern coast of Australia. The
island was formed by volcanic activity 6.4-6.9 my ago.LHI and thus it is an ideal site on which to test the
four criteria for sympatric speciation: 1) species sym-
patry, 2) sister relationships, 3) reproductive isolation,
and 4) that an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely.
Numerous plant genera, like Howea, are represented by
more than one endemic species on the island, which may
well be products of sympatric speciation. The student
will look at new pairs/groups of endemics:
(i) The student will combine existing DNA sequence
data from GenBank with new data collected and pro-
duced during the project to reconstruct evolutionary
relationships for ﬁve pairs/groups of endemic taxa.
(ii) During ﬁeldwork, the student will also document
species sympatry and habitat variables at a ﬁne scale.
(iii) The signature of the modes of speciation will be
studied with AFLP genome scans

A graduate position to study the molecular evolu-
tion of metabolic enzymes and networks is avail-
able in the Merritt lab in the Department of Chem-
istry and Biochemistry, Laurentian University ( http:/-
/web.mac.com/tjsmerritt ). The position is for either
a MSc or PhD student to start January or September
2008. My lab studies the NADP(H) enzyme network
in Drosophila melanogaster and related species. These
enzymes form a small, discrete, network that supplies
reducing power for lipid synthesis and detoxiﬁcation.
Current projects in the lab use naturally occurring and
laboratory generated genetic variation, sequence com-
parisons and direct experimentation to quantify inter-
actions between enzymes and downstream phenotypes.
My research program also examines changes in bio-
chemistry that result from genetic variation and the
physiological impact of these changes. The successful
applicant will be expected to build on current projects
and develop projects of their own, especially targeting
novel phenotypes impacted by the NADP(H) network
and functional variation across species. Student inter-
actions and collaborations across both the Departments
of Chemistry and Biochemistry and Biology will be en-
couraged.

2 PHD POSITIONS IN EVOLUTIONARY ECOL-
OGY (m/f) Vacancy number CTE-PVD-07329
Job description: Both PhD positions are part of the
NWO-VICI project “Adapting to a warmer world: phe-
nology, physiology and ﬁtness”. In this project, we
study selection on phenotypic plasticity in timing of
reproduction in great tits in relation to global climate
change. There are ﬁve integrated subprojects ranging
from quantitative genetics, population dynamics and
reproductive physiology to genomics. For two of these
subprojects we are looking for PhD candidates.
PhD position 1: “The mechanism underlying plasticity:
cues” Variation in plasticity of reproduction may be
explained by among-individual variation in how cues,
such as photoperiod and temperature, are used. This
subproject will therefore link the observed quantitative
genetic variation in laying date reaction norms to vari-
ation in sensitivity to photoperiod and temperature.
We will breed oﬀspring from wild parents with known
reaction norms in our unique facility of 36 climatised
aviaries and keep them under various photoperiod and
temperature regimes. We will measure gonadal devel-
opment and laying dates to determine the variation in
photoperiodic thresholds, circannual period length of
the seasonal clock and temperature sensitivity.
PhD position 2: “The mechanism underlying plasticity:
cost of reproduction” Variation in plasticity of repro-
duction may be explained by among-individual varia-
tion in the ability to obtain resources for egg produc-
tion. This subproject will therefore determine whether
the observed quantitative genetic variation in laying
date reaction norms is related to among-individual vari-
ation in the cost of egg production and incubation inearly spring. We will carry out ﬁeld experiments to
determine whether individuals with shallow reaction
norms advance their laying dates more strongly under
food supplementation than birds with genetically steep
reaction norms. Furthermore, we will manipulate lay-
ing dates and measure variation among individuals in
Daily Energy Expenditure (DEE) during egg laying and
incubation.
Requirements: We are looking for enthusiastic candi-
dates with a Master in Evolutionary Ecology or Animal
Ecology, and with an aﬃnity for reproductive physiol-
ogy.
Appointment: The appointment will be on a temporary
basis for a maximum of 4 years. The gross salary starts
at Euro 1.956,- per month in the 1st year, and will
gradually increase to a maximum of Euro 2.502,- per
month in the 4th year, scale P, Collective Agreement for
Dutch Universities (CAO-Nederlandse Universiteiten),
excluding 8% holiday pay and a year-end bonus. We
oﬀer an extensive package of fringe beneﬁts.
Information: Additional information about these po-
sitions is available upon request from Prof. Marcel

StAndrewsU MeasuringBiodiversity
St Andrews Studentship in Statistical Ecology: mea-
suring biodiversity
This PhD studentship will be within the National Cen-
tre for Statistical Ecology, a joint research centre be-
tween the Universities of Kent, Cambridge and St An-
drews, and will be based at St Andrews in Scotland.
Nearly 200 countries have signed up to the goal of re-
ducing the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010. This
raises the question of how regional biodiversity should
be measured. Without suitable measures and associ-
ated precision estimates, we cannot assess whether the
¨ ı¿1
22010 targets¨ ı¿1
2have been met. However, most bio-
diversity study sites are unrepresentative and incapable
of delivering estimates of regional biodiversity. Fur-
ther, the impact of variable detectability or trappability
among species and across sites on biodiversity measures
is typically ignored.
In this project, the student will review existing bio-diversity measures, and assess their relevance to the
2010 targets. Shortcomings will be identiﬁed, and bet-
ter methods developed. Survey design will also be re-
viewed, and recommendations made for future survey
schemes.
The studentship covers home fees and the standard re-
search council stipend for 3 years. It is open to any
applicant, but applicants from outside the European
Union will need to seek additional funding to cover the
diﬀerence between home and overseas fees. Applicants
should have a ﬁrst degree in statistics, or in a related
discipline with a strong quantitative component. Start
date is negotiable, but should be between October 2007
and October 2008.

Successful applicants will be able to participate in a
variety of ongoing and future projects aimed at under-
standing the evolution of skeletal patterning. Several
vertebrate taxa are currently being studied in the lab,
including zebraﬁsh, African cichlids and Antarctic ice-
ﬁshes. The approach of the lab is to integrate studies
in a laboratory model (i.e., zebraﬁsh) and natural pop-
ulations (i.e., cichlids) to understand the evolution of
animal form and function. Methods of study include
comparative embryology, developmental and molecu-
lar genetics, quantitative genetics, and morphometric
shape analysis.

MothConservationGenetics
PhD position in conservation genetics
Topic: Conservation genetics of the protected moth
Graellsia isabelae Location: A Coruna (NW Spain) and
Orl´ eans (France)
The PhD project is focused on Graellsia isabelae
(Gra¨ ells, 1849) a moth (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) dis-
tributed mainly in Spain, with a few small populations
in France and Switzerland. It is highly protected at
both national and international level. However, there is
neither genetic nor population data which would allow
to set up a suitable conservation plan for this species.
The PhD student will use newly developed microsatel-
lite markers and DNA sequence data to deﬁne Evolu-
tionary Signiﬁcant Units by studying intraspeciﬁc ge-
netic variability, population genetic structure and di-
vergence.
The project is supervised by Dr Marta Vila and Dr Ho-
racio Naveira, University of A Coruna (Spain) and Dr
Carlos Lopez-Vaamonde (INRA Orl´ eans, France). It is
funded for 4 years by the Spanish Ministry of Educa-
tion and Science (FPI program, 2 years fellowship + 2
years working contract). Salary for the ﬁrst two years(fellowship, no taxes) is 13,440 euros per year. The
salary increases to 16,100 euros per year for the third
and fourth year (contract, before taxes). The project
will be based in A Coruna, while some important ex-
periments will be performed in Orl´ eans.
Requirements for the position: (i) high motivation,
(ii) a good academic record, (iii) ﬂuency in both En-
glish and Spanish, (iv) driving licence, (v) willingness
to spend long periods in the ﬁeld (French Alps and
Spanish sierras). A good level of French, knowledge
of population genetics as well as prior experience in
the ﬁeld (e.g., capture-mark-recapture) and laboratory
(i.e., DNA sequencing, microsatellite genotyping) will
be highly valued. Women are especially encouraged to
apply.

Several African cichlid ﬁsh and North American species
are currently being studied in the lab, varying in their
social and reproductive systems. For these diﬀerent
species, we know a lot about their ecology and evolu-
tion, but we know much less about the molecular and
endocrine mechanisms that underlie individual varia-

physiology and life histories. In our group, we use an in-
tegrative approach combining functional genomics (mi-
croarrays, quantitative real time PCR), endocrinology
(pharmacological manipulations, EIA), evolution and
behavioural biology. A position in our research group
therefore provides a unique experience combining re-
search at the organismic and molecular levels.

adaptation, particularly in response to stressful envi-
ronments and long-term global climate change.
Laboratory experiments will involve DNA microarrays
to study gene expression changes due to diﬀerent host
cacti and temperature stresses, as well as diﬀerences in
epicuticular hydrocarbons. Field- related work will in-
clude multiple ﬁeld trips to Mexico to monitor wild ﬂies,
assess demography of wild populations, and analyze cu-
ticular hydrocarbon and RNA proﬁles. The positions
are part of a collaborative project involving the Univ.
of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and the Univ. of Nevada, Las
Vegas. One research assistantship will be available at
each institution.

NSF-IGERT Fellowships at the University of Notre
Dame
GLOBES Interdisciplinary PhD Program
The new GLOBES program at the University of Notre
Dame is seeking outstanding students in the biolog-
ical and social sciences to join our team of faculty
and scholars in addressing environmental challenges
to human and global health. Launched by funding
from an IGERT (Integrated Graduate Education, Re-
search and Traineeship) grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation, GLOBES is an interdisciplinary PhD
program studying Global Linkages of Biology, the Envi-
ronment, and Society. By forging teaching and research
collaborations among faculty and across departments,
GLOBES oﬀers a multifaceted approach to graduate
student training.
The goals of the GLOBES program are two-fold. First,
GLOBES integrates the collective skills of the Univer-
sity’s biologists, social scientists, and legal scholars in
a team-based eﬀort to investigate pressing problems in
environmental degradation, the evolution and genetics
of infectious disease, and the ecological and evolution-
ary dynamics of the spread of invasive species. Notre
Dame faculty involved in GLOBES study topics includ-
ing speciation, ecological genetics, and the evolutionary
consequences of climate change.
Second, GLOBES is dedicated to imparting the next
generation of Notre Dame graduate students with the
knowledge, technical tools, and real-world experience
needed to combat global challenges in socially respon-
sible and ethically sound ways.
Students who have a strong interest in team-based, in-
terdisciplinary studies and environmental research are
encouraged to apply. Fellowships, available to U.S. res-
idents and permanent citizens, feature a ﬁve-year, gen-
erous support package that includes 2.5 years of IGERT
stipends in the amount of $30,000 annually, a full waiver
of graduate tuition, and research and travel funds.
Application deadlines for Fall 2008 admission vary de-
pending on the home department of study. Partici-
pating departments include Biological Sciences (Jan. 5
deadline), Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Bio-
chemistry, Economics and Econometrics, History, Phi-
losophy, History and Philosophy of Science, and Theol-
ogy. Anthropology students (co-advised through Biol-
ogy) can also participate in GLOBES.

Our research programme aims to investigate the key
factors inﬂuencing the evolution of host speciﬁcity in
parasites. More speciﬁcally, the research will exam-
ine how plasticity in phenotype (morphology and be-
haviour) and genetic variation aﬀect the ability of par-
asites to exploit novel hosts. We will use a native
New Zealand marine trematode (parasitic ﬂatworm)
species that infects coastal crustaceans as an exper-
imental model, with the work involving a combina-
tion of experimental parasitology and genetic analy-
ses. The PhD project will ﬁt within this overall theme.
Candidates should have interests and/or experience in
either host-parasite interactions or evolutionary biol-
ogy. More importantly, candidates should be highly
motivated and enthusiastic about pursuing doctoral re-
search.

PhD student position in Ecology Dept. of Ecology,
Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala
“Habitat selection, demography and evolutionary con-
sequences of changes in agriculture and climate in
northern wheatears”
The new Department of Ecology conducts research and
education in applied ecology: eﬀects of human activ-
ity and environmental change on pest species, wildlife
management and biodiversity.
We are looking for a PhD student who will work with
basic applied research on the exciting links between evo-lution, population dynamics and conservation and how
these links are aﬀected by a modern agriculture and cli-
mate change. The model system is a long-term popula-
tion study (15 years) of northern wheatears (Oenanthe
oenanthe) outside Uppsala, Sweden. Today we have
data on 2300 breeding attempts and detailed data on
individual survival, reproduction, and habitat choice.
Thus, high-quality background data exist already. You
will be able to investigate: why adults have lower sur-
vival in certain habitats, whether juvenile movements in
the post-breeding season are to improve survival or next
year’s choice of breeding site, whether climate change in
relation to landuse may explain reduced breeding suc-
cess in certain age classes, and whether genes determine
habitat selection and reproductive output.
The overall aim is to deepen our knowledge about fac-
tors aﬀecting populations in disturbed landscapes, such
as farmland. Farmland birds are declining rapidly and
knowledge about the basics in habitat selection demog-
raphy and evolutionary responses are badly needed.
You will be part of a large research group working with
biodiversity in farmlands of which at least three are
presently working with this study system. The posi-
tion will be at Uppsala.
You need a Masters degree in Ecology or equivalent.
Experience in ﬁeldwork, bird ringing, and data anal-
ysis together with good skills in writing English is an
advantage.

collections. The PhD would further develop this
methodology (core collection concept) and apply it to
a large existing collection of one of the most important
pasture plants in Australia (subterranean clover).
Project 2: Detection of genomic regions under selec-
tion. We are using Geography Information Systems and
molecular markers to identify genomic regions adapting
to environmental change. The PhD will develop these
methods in subterranean clover and red clover in collab-
oration with Kazusa DNA Research Institute in Japan.
Visits to Japan would be likely.
Project 3: Genetic monitoring of fungal and virus dis-
ease resistance in clover. This program will use existing
and new microsatellite DNA to compare red and sub-
terranean clovers, and develop QTL maps. The project
provides the opportunity for ﬁeldwork at various loca-
tions in WA.
Project 4: Genetics of ﬂowering time in clover. At UWA
and Murdoch Univerity we are interested in the genet-
ics of ﬂowering time. The PhD student will use data
obtained from our two mapping populations of subter-
ranean clover in existing or novel programs to map the
ﬂowering time QTLs. There would be ﬁeldwork too.

UZurich 2 PrimateBrainSizeEvol
**Two PhD Positions in Primatology**
We look for two ambitious, highly motivated applicants
for three-year PhD positions to work on a comparative
study of the energetic aspects of brain size evolution at
the Anthropological Institute and Museum (University
of Z˜A1
4rich).
In the Swiss National Foundation (SNF) project ˆ aThe
Expensive Brain: Comparative Analyses of Variation in
Relative Brain Sizeˆ a by K. Isler and C. van Schaik we
examine brain size evolution from an energy-cost per-
spective. To allow an increase in brain size, either total
energy metabolism must be increased, or the organ-
ism reduces energy allocation to other functions such
as production, digestion or locomotion.
The ﬁrst PhD project will be focused on trade-oﬀs be-
tween brain tissue and the digestive tract or other ex-
pensive organs by applying the comparative method on
primates or mammals in general. You will start by
compiling published quantitative data and collect com-
plementary data from dissections of various mammalian
species.
The second PhD project investigates the implication ofthe energy- cost perspective that a populationˆ as brain
size is negatively correlated with the frequency of expo-
sure to periods of unavoidable starvation, as suggested
by recent work on orangutans. In addition to a com-
parative analysis of published data, you will also collect
endocranial capacities from primate genera or species
inhabiting a broad range of habitats with documented
seasonal food shortages.
You will be working in an international, multidisci-
plinary team of primatologists and paleoanthropolo-
gists at one of Europeˆ as leading institutions in this ﬁeld.
Salaries rise from CHF 34000 in the ﬁrst year to CHF
40000 in the third year.
Interested applicants should have a strong interest in
zoology and primatology, a good background in evo-
lutionary biology, a very good academic track record,
be ﬂuent in written and spoken English and hold the
equivalent of a Masterˆ as degree. Advanced skills in sta-
tistical data analysis and, for the ﬁrst project, previous
experience with dissections are required.
Candidates should send a letter of application, a cur-
riculum vitae, a transcript of the university diplomas,
contact information for three references, and a sum-
mary of the Masterˆ as thesis (all combined to a single
PDF) to Karin Isler at kisler@aim.uzh.ch no later than
October 31, 2007. Start of the project is planned for
February 1, 2008.

A three-year Ph.D. studentship in evolutionary genet-
ics is available in the laboratory of Andreas Wagner at
the University of Zurich. Applications will be consid-
ered for both computational and experimental projects.
The Wagner lab at the University of Zurich studies
biological evolution on all levels of organization, from
genes, genomes, and genetic networks to whole organ-
isms. Ongoing projects range from laboratory evo-
lution experiments in yeast to human population ge-
nomics. A sample of our research can be found at
http://www.biochem.uzh.ch/wagner/.** Lab members
are a group with very diverse backgrounds and research
projects, uniﬁed by their interests in evolution and /or
fundamental organizational principles of life.
A successful candidate for an experimental project will
have substantial research experience with microbiologi-
cal and molecular biological techniques, acquired in re-
search projects with an evolutionary orientation. Ex-
perience in performing microarray experiments will be
a plus. A successful candidate for a computational
project will have a strong background in bioinformat-
ics and computational biology. Fluency in a major
scripting language such as perl, and experience in soft-
ware development is a must. Also necessary is a strong
background in biology. Applications without a demon-
strated interest and research history in evolutionary bi-ology will not be considered further
We are looking for an individual with a Masters De-
gree or equivalent, who is highly self-motivated and can
work independently. The working language in the lab-
oratory is English. German skills, although helpful, are
not essential.
Zurich is a highly attractive city in beautiful surround-
ings, with a multinational population, and many edu-
cational and recreational opportunities.
To be considered, please send a single (!)
PDF ﬁle merged from the following parts to

Please note that the DEADLINE is September 21!
CIBIO is a young and highly dynamic Research Cen-
tre located close to Porto, in the north of Portugal,
that aims to be an international Centre of Excellence in
the general ﬁelds of Biodiversity and Evolution, oﬀer-
ing great opportunities for multidisciplinary research.
The Centre occupies recently-built facilities, and nowhas approximately 50 researchers holding a PhD degree
and more than 50 MSc and PhD students, as well as

logenetics and molecular evolution. The position is for
ﬁve years, and is expected to become permanent at
the end of this period. Although the exact ﬁeld of re-
search is open, the expected researcher is likely to work
on molecular phylogeny and phylogeography of verte-
brates from the Mediterranean region. It would also
be desirable if the candidate had experience working
with islands systems within this region. It is further
expected that the researcher will study the molecular
evolution of the applied markers, as well as performing
phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses. The post

good communicator and speak and write ﬂuent English,
and will be asked to participate in teaching at the MSc
and PhD levels. The ranking of candidates will result
from a global appreciation of the Curriculum vitae fol-
lowed by an interview. Salary (14 salaries per year)
will be approximately 3000 euros per month gross (or
around 2100 euros net). Applications ? including a
detailed CV, a statement of research interests and mo-
tivation, as well as the emails of at least three referees -

cal methods for the analysis and hypothesis testing of
the recent evolution of multiple organisms studied at
CIBIO. Accordingly, he/she is expected to master pop-
ulation genetics theory, including the coalescent, and
to have experience in statistical inference : Bayesian
analysis, simulations (e.g. MCMC). In addition, the
mastering of spatial statistics and programing knowl-
edge is highly desirable. The successful applicant is
expected to develop strong collaborations with other
researchers within the CIBIO, and will have access to a
series of relevant studies performed with diﬀerent types
of molecular markers. The candidate should have a de-
gree in Biology, a minimum of 3 years as Post-doc and
a Curriculum vitae proving solid knowledge in theo-
retical population genetics. The candidate should ad-
ditionally have a signiﬁcant publication record in SCI

Portugal FieldAssist OtterEvol
I’m seeking enthusiastic undergraduates and recent col-
lege graduates who are interested in a ﬁeld research in
Portugal. The overall objective of my research pro-
gram is to study the behavioural ecology of the Eu-
ropean Otter (Lutra lutra). More in detail, I’m try-
ing to understand the relationships between the use
of space of this species and the availability and dis-
persion of the resources, mainly freshwater. This
could be of particular interest in an ecosystem, like
the Portuguese one, which is strongly inﬂuenced by
summer droughts and heavily altered by humans (by
creating many reservoirs). I’m carrying out a PhD
of the University of Rome (Italy) with Prof Luigi
Boitani ( http://dipbau.bio.uniroma1.it/web/Docenti/-
Docente364/index.htm ) as advisor, and I’m collaborat-
ing with the Prof Ant&#972;nio Mira, the head of the
Conservation Biology Unit of the University of ¨ ı¿1
2vora
(http://www.ubc.uevora.pt/ ). The ﬁeld work started
at the end of June 2007, I’m already tracking three
otters, and many others will be hopefully caught and
followed soon. Successful applicants will assist withﬁeldwork (consisting of trapping sessions, radiotrack-
ing, preys samplings and collection of environmental
data) in our Study Area (Alentejo, South of Portugal),
and with data entry. In addition, successful applicants
could develop their own individual research projects on
a topic related to the program and their own interests,
with the opportunity to carry out their Final Degree
Thesis, and, if particularly motivated, to be involved in
the publications. Successful applicants should provide
by theirself for the logistic (accommodations and liv-
ing expenses), with the only lucky that here the cost of
life it is not prohibitive. Strong motivation to work in
extreme environmental conditions, during both nights
(mainly) and days, and a valid European Driver’s li-
cense are required. Class background in animal ecol-
ogy, zoology, statistics, and experience in radioteleme-
try techniques would be an advantage. Competent, en-
thusiastic, and emotionally mature people desired! For

Endowed Chair, Global Change Biology
University of Arkansas, Fayetteville
The Department of Biological Sciences is continuing its
search for an energetic leader in Global Change Bi-
ology. We seek to expand our department’s core ar-
eas of research to include the biotic and evolutionary
consequences of environmental change, eﬀects of cli-
mate change on biodiversity, and through leadership
of the Endowed Chair, continue to build the depart-
ment’s mission in research and training, and establish
an international reputation in global change biology.
Rank is open, and candidates must have a Ph.D.,
postdoctoral experience, and a demonstrated record of
research evident from signiﬁcant extramural funding
and publications in recognized, peer- reviewed scien-
tiﬁc journals and books. We envision hiring an accom-
plished and creative scientist who can work with de-
partment faculty whose interests range from molecular44 EvolDir October 1, 2007
biology to ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as
faculty across campus, to help focus local, national, and
international attention on the causes and consequences
of global climate change.
The University of Arkansas is a land grant institution
and the state’s main Ph.D. granting institution with
an enrollment of over 18,000 students. Department
facilities include the university’s Stable Isotope Lab-
oratory, the USGS Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Re-
search Unit, a recently constructed 40,000 ft2 research
building, a recently renovated green house, and a mod-
ern, renovated oﬃce and classroom building. The de-
partment is a sustaining member of the Organization
for Tropical Studies (OTS). Allied campus facilities in-
clude the DNA Resource Center, advanced resources
for geospatial analysis at the Center for Advanced Spa-
tial Technologies, the Department of Geosciences’ Tree-
Ring Laboratory, and water and soil analyses at the
Arkansas Water Resources Center.
This Endowed Chair was made possible by a generous
gift of $300 million in 2002 from the Walton Family
Foundation that has helped increase the overall uni-
versity endowment to near $1 billion. In addition to
a number of endowed chair positions across campus,
these funds were also dedicated to establishing a new
Honors College, increasing funding for Mullins Library,
and signiﬁcantly increasing funds for graduate student
stipends. The endowment for the Chair in Global
Change Biology is $1.5 million.
The University of Arkansas is located in Fayetteville
on the western edge of the Ozark plateau. Proximity
to the Ozark National Forest and many natural areas,
as well as many nearby streams, rivers, and lakes has
made northwest Arkansas a popular tourist destination
as well as an attractive and aﬀordable place to live. A
progressive city government, a thriving economy, and a
host of cultural amenities in a small town atmosphere
have contributed to Fayetteville’s reputation as one of
the most livable cities in the country.
Application review is ongoing and will continue until
the position is ﬁlled. Send a curriculum vitae, state-
ments of research and teaching interests, speciﬁc plans
for advancing the department’s focus in global change
biology, and at least three letters of recommendation to

ABI upgrade
Dear Evoldir members,
our lab is since 4 years in the possession of an ABI 3130
AVANT (4 capillaries) and very happy with it. Now,
we received new funding to have some more genotyping
capacity. After having informed at ABI, we heard that
the price for an upgrade from 4 to 16 capillaries is the
same as a brand new machine with 4 capillaries.
My question is thus, what experienced ABI users wouldsuggest to do: buying a new machine (8 capillaries
would be enough for our planned work) or do an up-
grade to 16 capillaries, considering that the rest (laser,
camera, etc) is already 4 years old. If anybody had to
deal with the same decision, I would be happy to hear
the reason(s) for their choice.
Any comment/suggestion welcome !

Arabidopsis stocks
As part of my dissertation on global population genetic
patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana, either I or my collab-
orators collected silica-dried leaves or seed from over
500 individuals representing over 50 new Arabidopsis
thaliana populations. Most of these were in areas for
which few or no populations were available, such as the
Caucasus region and the Balkan peninsula. Addition-
ally, multiple individuals (usually 8) were collected from
most of these new populations.
I recently made 261 of these newly collected lines avail-
able through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Cen-
ter (ABRC), and I’m maintaining a set of webpages
describing each population. These provide details in-
cluding latitude/longitude, elevation, habitat, approx-
imate population size, and collector. Images from the
collection site are often also provided.
These pages can be viewed by following the link to
“Arabidopsis thaliana seed stock information” on my
website:
http://www.duke.edu/˜jbb31/ It is my hope that these
new lines continue to spur research involving this model
organism, particularly in previously under-studied ge-ographic areas. Please feel free to email me with any
comments/questions.

Clone or sequence
Dear Collegues,
I would like to ask you a very simple question. After
amplifying a PCR product on an agarose gel and ob-
taining a very clear unique band, is it necesary to clon
into a plasmid and then sequence, or could be the PCR
product directly sequenced? If it should be cloned into
the plasmid, what is the reason?

CombiningLoci NetworkAnalysis
Dear community,
Here a question on the use of Nested Clade (Phylogeo-
graphic) Analysis.
I’m trying to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of
my study organisms (and that are plants). Therefore I
sequenced some chloroplast, ribosomal and nuclear re-
gions, but found little variation. Because of this I tested
whether these loci gave signiﬁcantly diﬀerent phyloge-
netic signals, which they didn’t, so I combined them in
my further traditional phylogenetic analysis.
Because of several reasons I also want to construct a
network and do some NCPA, but I’m afraid that (just
as in the “traditional” method) the individual loci will
not contain enough information. So I’m looking for
some advice on why I should or shouldn’t combine these
loci? And is the earlier mentioned partition homogene-
ity test useful in this respect?October 1, 2007 EvolDir 61

Museum ﬁght bites bureau Scientist calls Creation Mu-
seum plug ’inﬂammatory’ BY MIKE RUTLEDGE |
MRUTLEDGE@NKY.COM
*
PETERSBURG - The head of the Kentucky Paleon-
tological Society is criticizing local tourism oﬃcials for
promoting the Creation Museum using inﬂammatory
language from the museum’s Web site.
The Northern Kentucky Convention & Visitors Bureau
on its Web site says of the controversial museum: “This
’walk through history’ museum will counter evolution-
ary natural history museums that turn countless minds
against Christ and Scripture.”
Natural history museums don’t turn people against reli-
gion, counters Daniel Phelps, paleontology society pres-
ident. If they did, there would be regular protests out-
side those museums.“There’s many people who are very
religious, and they don’t have a problem with evolu-
tion,” Phelps said.
“If the creationists want to say things like that on their
own Web site, that’s their business,” he said.
“I was pretty shocked that a tax-supported entity would
do anything like that,” Phelps said.The 60,000-square-foot, $27 million museum has
sparked national controversy with assertions that go
against the grain of scientiﬁc consensus.
The museum declares that Earth is 6,000 years old,
rather than about 4.5 billion. It also depicts humans as
living at the same time as dinosaurs, which scientists
say never happened.
“We do list attractions on our Web site, and the attrac-
tions provide the content, because they know the venues
best,” said Pat Frew, spokesman for the bureau. “We
simply provide a listing and description on the Web site
as a service to them.”

As a follow up to Dr. Coyne’s request yesterday, I will
point out that the description of the Creation Museum
was changed last weekend after public pressure.
The visitors bureau now describes the creation museum
as
“A walk through history via the pages of the Bible ex-
ploring how scripture provides an eye-witness account
of the beginning of all things.”

DarwinDayPetition
Greetings,
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Portland State University.
Our biology graduate student association developed a
petition to be signed by scientists requesting libraries
and bookstores to reclassify intelligent design (id) books
from science shelves to more appropriate places in the
library/bookstore. (We call it the “Darwin Day Peti-
tion” because it was part of the celebration of Darwin’s
Birthday 2007.)
We are requesting you to read (and of course sign)
the petition, giving your support to our eﬀorts. You
can ﬁnd the petition at: http://sciencea2z.com/-
zpetition 1/For more information about the petition:
http://www.sciencea2z.com/z etomite/ There are a
couple of points that have been made about our pe-
tition. First, our intent to submit the petition to the
Library of Congress is for their support and informa-
tion. Second, the petition can be separately submit-
ted to libraries and bookstores that do classify some of
their id books in with evolution, requesting that theyOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 63
are reshelved to more appropriate areas.
Thank you.

Estimating Ne
Dear EvolDir,
I am looking for some advice on calculating eﬀective
population size from demographic data, speciﬁcally, the
number of breeding pairs of a colony of birds. I am com-
paring this estimate to a genetic estimate of (female)
long-term eﬀective population size.
Speciﬁcally, I was hoping someone might be able to
clarify how to calculate Ne from Nb taking into account
reproductive success, generation time, meta-population
structure, and population ﬂuctuations. All the formu-
las I have found refer to estimating Ne from Nc (census
size), not directly from breeding pairs.
The species in question as a generation time of approx-
imately 6 years, each pair ﬂedges on average 1 chick in
a breeding season. I have some data on survivorship of
adults as well.
Any input would be most appreciated,

Genetix software questions
Dear Evol Dir!!
The use of Factorial Corresponce Analysis (FCA) in
the program Genetix* as become increasingly popular
for depicting genotypic relationships among individu-
als scored at a number of microsatellite loci. I consider
this approach nice for exploratory analysis as well as
presentations, especially to audiences not necessarily
receptive to discussing or viewing Fst-values, trees-of-
individuals, or Bayesian assignment probabilities. I do
not think this approach should be used as a surrogate
for more rigorouse quantitative analysis.
In any case, I have two questions concerning the proce-
dure.
First, the program Genetix limits the size of the data set
that can be analysed, and my data sets far exceed this
limit. I have written the authors of the program but
have received no response. Does anybody know how to
increase the data limits of this procedure in Genetix?
Second, and relatedly, can someone explain to me the
exact data input structure used to carry out the FCA
in Genetix (that is, how are the alleles or genotypes ar-
ranged as variables and objects), because if I knew this
I should be able to carry out the analysis in any stan-
dard statistical package (such as SPSS or SAS), and
thus gain both more control and understanding of the
analysis and output.
Thanks in advance,64 EvolDir October 1, 2007

Dear Evoldir members:
I am preparing a chapter concerning genetic cartogra-

Unfortunately, I am unable to access the original pub-
lication because in France, because of WW2, the issues
of those years were not received.
Can you help me to get one of such ﬁgures, possibly
as a high quality scanning? As a ’reward’ I will send

in Ants speciﬁcally Lasis neoniger. We are trying to
ﬁnd some information about female genitalia (exter-October 1, 2007 EvolDir 65
nal) and genital openings. We have been having diﬃ-
culties obtaining information on Lasius queens’ genital
anatomy. We can only ﬁnd some information stating
that all openings (Vaginal, Anal) are found within the
acidopore. If you can give us some advice or direct us
in the direction where one could ﬁnd more information
it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for

Negative spatial autocorrelation
Hi all.
I am using Genalex to test for spatial autocorrelation
in my sample of D-loop DNA sequences. Several of the
references of the program say that under a scenario of
restricted gene ﬂow one should expect positive spatial
autocorrelation at short distances, no autocorrelation
at medium distances and negative autocorrelation at
large distances (Peakall et al, 2003, Smouse and Peakal
1999, see below). I can understand why the ﬁrst two
would be expected but cannot grasp why pairs of indi-
viduals separated by larger distances should be genet-
ically more similar than would be expected under the
null hypothesis of no restrictions to gene ﬂow. Refer-
ences given for this statement are for articles that have
found that to be the case via computer simulations. Bi-
ologically however (or maybe just logically) I don’t see
a reason for this. Can anyone help me understand?
Many thanks in advance,

Peakall et al 2003 “Under restricted gene ﬂow, and in
the absence of selection, such populations will be char-
acterized by positive spatial genetic autocorrelation at
short distance classes, subsequently declining through
zero and becoming negative (e.g., Turner et al. 1982;
Sokal and Wartenberg 1983; Epperson 1990; Smouse
and Peakall 1999).”Smouse and Peakall, 1999 “Subsequent computer stud-
ies haver conﬁrmed that positive spatial autocorrela-
tion, declining with distance, develops quickly under
restricted gene ﬂow (Sokal and Wartenberg 1983; Sokal
et al, 1989; Epperson 1990,1995a,b; Sokal & Jacquez,

Negative spatial autocorrelation
answers
Hello everyone.
I received requests for the answers to my negative
spatial autocorrelation question so below I have sum-
marised them. I thank everyone (Suzanne Sadedin,
Craig Streatﬁeld, Filipe Alberto, Kathryn Elmer,
Heribert Hofer, Paul Sunnucks, Ross Croizer and
Xavier Turon) very much for their kind attention to
it.
It seems I had simply gotten mixed up in a jumble of
words (more similar, less dissimilar, more genetic dis-
tance: more diﬀerence, less distance..). The term neg-
ative spatial autocorrelation refers to individuals be-
ing less similar (more diﬀerent) than expected, not the
other way around as I said in the past email. Now
things do make biological sense to me! I am glad I sent
the question not only because this has been made clear
to me but because some of the answers, including one
from an email sent directly to Genalex authors Peter
Smouse and Rod Peakall, have turned my attention to
the fact that because of the way calculations are made,
a see-saw eﬀect comes into play: if you push up on one
side (positive autocorrelation) the opposite side goes
down (negative autocorrelation). No pushing on either
side makes for a ﬂat see-saw (no autocorrelation, no
restrictions to gene ﬂow at the scale that is being mea-
sured). I incorporated the see-saw analogy myself and
it’s not without its imperfections so please see Smouse’s
explanation below.
Thanks again,

Peter Smouse quote:
The correlation of two individuals is deﬁned, relative to
what would happen for the average pair in the study,
which average is (by virtue of the way the autocorrela-
tion is computed from the covariance matrix) precisely
zero. If the average autocorrelation (over the whole
data set) is centered at zero (and it is), then if some of
the N(N-1)/2 pairs are positively autocorrelated, oth-
ers must be negatively autocorrelated. Otherwise, the
whole set would not average out to zero! If the close
neighbors are positively autocorrelated, and they typi-
cally are, then those that are more distant will be neg-
atively autocorrelated. As I said, not profound, just a
matter of having the algebra add up properly. Another
way to say it, in less algebraic terms, is that if some
individuals are more correlated (related) than average,
others must be less correlated (related) than average,
since the average is deﬁned to be “uncorrelated”.

NematodeEvol survey
Conference on Nematode Evolution — Survey
We are conducting a survey to see how many people
would likely attend a major conference on the Evolu-
tion & Ecology of Nematodes, which would be held in
2010 at a site in Europe (tentatively in the UK). This
conference is intended as the successor to the wildly
successful EMBO Workshop on the evolutionary biol-
ogy of Caenorhabditis held in Portugal in May, 2006.
This meeting would cover the evolution of Caenorhab-
ditis species and also of other nematodes. Participants
would include basic researchers working in the areas
of population genetics, molecular evolution, genome
evolution, experimental evolution, developmental evo-
lution, biodiversity and phylogenetics, ecology, and the
evolution of parasitism. The meeting would be for both
bioinformaticians and wet-lab biologists. The overall
goals are to bring together people from diverse ﬁelds
to further develop the Caenorhabditis system for com-
parative biology and to better connect it to the wider
context of the phylum Nematoda.
To help our application for funding for the conference,
we need to know how many people would be interested
in attending. . If you are inclined to attend such a
conference, please email either of and let us know:1. What is your position? (principal investiga-
tor/postdoc/graduate student/other)
2. If not a PI, with what lab are you aﬃliated? (give
name of PI)
3. If a PI, how many people from your lab would at-
tend?
4. If you attended the 2006 meeting, have you initi-
ated any new collaborations or begun new programs of
research as a result? [Note that we may quote some
responses in our application.]

Phylogenies rates of change
Hi,
A colleague asked me the following question and I’m
unable to answer it. Since it sounds like something
evoldirians might be familiar with, I though I’d give it
a shot here.
Quoting my friend:
“I am interested in comparing rates of morphological
change in continuous variables representing two diﬀer-
ent morphological systems. I’ve got a well-resolved,
dated phylogeny and tons of data, but I’m stumped
by two issues.
For one morphological system I can easily deﬁne two
characters with diﬀerent functional implications. No
problem there. The second system is quite complex
and contains seven functionally divergent groups, but
I would like to summarize it in a single character in
order to compare the two systems in a straightforward
manner. I am considering using discriminant functionOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 67
scores from a classiﬁcation analysis of the seven groups.
Can anyone recommend papers that have done that or,
alternatively, reasons why it is a particularly bad idea?
I am a little concerned because the ﬁrst discriminant
function describes only 47% of the variation among
the groups (DF2 = 25% and DF3 = 18%). I’ve tried
pruning the input variables and trying slightly diﬀerent
groupings but it doesn’t get much better than that.
The second issue is associated with comparing rates of
evolution. The interesting question for these data is
whether one system evolved ﬁrst and the other later
(i.e. did one lead and the other follow) or did they
evolve together. I am familiar with Barton and Nunn
(Proc. R. Soc. 1999) and will try that method. Since
the characters are on much diﬀerent scales, should I
transform them so they have the same range of values
before doing the analyses? Also, are there other meth-
ods out there that I might try?”
Thanks for any ideas you can share,
Sean

Dear EvolDir members,
I am planing to do quantitative PCR analyses of my
gene of interest (GOI) relative to three or more house
keeping genes (HGK). Right now I started to validate
my HKGs against 1 µg of total RNA I used in my re-
verse transcription (RT) reaction. I run a two step de-
sign with three RT replicates for each RNA sample and
two replicates for each during qPCR. The eﬃciency of
my RT reactions varies in extreme up to +/- 20%. So
far I realised if the RT has been insuﬃcient, but if all
three replicates are equally insuﬃcient I would detect
this as an expression diﬀerence in this potential HKG.
That is why I would like to use an endogenous inter-
nal RNA standard as a control of my RT eﬃciencies.
This method is referred as the method of choice in be-
ing most accurate but unfortunatly does not seemed to
be very common in use. Does someone know if there
are RNA standards commercially available and where I
can get? Or do I have to produce them by my own? In
this case I would kindly ask if someone has a protocol
about this.
Would be great if someone could help me out or give
me a hint where to ﬁnd further information about this
topic.
Thanks a lot and all the best!

Rodent microsatellites
Dear EvolDir members:
I’m part of a research team in Mexico and we are start-
ing two research projects about population genetics of
two mouse species: Liomys irroratus (Heteromyidae)68 EvolDir October 1, 2007
and Baiomys musculus (Muridae) at a tropical dry for-
est in central Mexico.
As part of our methods we will use microsatellite analy-
sis, however we haven’t found yet any publication or are
aware of someone who has obtained so far microsatellite
primers for this species, and even for this two rodent
genera.
We want to know if any EvolDir member can give us
some clue about if someone is working on that and
therefore is not yet published or if someone knows a
publication (even a technical report) about microsatel-
lite primers for any of this two rodent genera.
Asides, seems it looks highly probable that we’ll have to
do the microsatellite primers, we want to ask to EvolDir
members, if someone can give us insight about poten-
tial costs for do this or if, alternatively, it can be done
as a payable service and where (e.g. any commercial or
non-commercial research lab that can oﬀer this sort of
service).
Also, we are open to potential collaborative work with
our research project, which can happen through this
particular research need of doing the microsatellite
primers for both species.
We’ll appreciate any help or answer you might be able
to provide us.
Best wishes,

Software BAli-Phy 2 0 0
BAli-Phy is a computer program for co-estimating
alignments and phylogenies in a Bayesian statistical
framework. It avoids bias towards a guide tree by
merging alignment estimation and phylogeny estima-
tion into a single step and summing over all alignments
weighted by their posterior probability. BAli-Phy un-
derstands DNA, RNA, protein, and codon data, and
can account for rate heterogeneity among sites using
either a log-normal or gamma distribution. http://-
www.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/bali-phy/ We have
recently released version BAli-Phy 2.0.0 with many im-
provements. It is available on Linux, Windows, and
Mac, and the source code is freely available. Improve-
ments include: * Ease of use - and the User’s Guide is
much improved. * Use Tracer for visualizing MCMC
output and results. * Additional plots to visualize
alignment uncertainty. * Implement the GTR model
for nucletides. * Handle R,Y,W,S nucleotide patterns
in DNA/RNA and codon alphabets. * Easier (optional)
compilation [autoconf] * Improved SPR proposals for
jointly proposing tree & alignment.

http://people.bu.edu/msoren/TreeRot.html Descrip-October 1, 2007 EvolDir 69
tion: TreeRot aids in the determination of decay indices
(a.k.a. Bremer support, Bremer 1988 Evolution) by
generating a command ﬁle for PAUP or PAUP* (Swof-
ford 1993, 2002). The command ﬁle includes 1) a con-
straint statement for each node in a given shortest or
strict consensus tree and 2) commands to search for
trees inconsistent with each of these constraint state-
ments in turn. TreeRot also automates the determina-
tion of partitioned Bremer support values. Although
generally used in parsimony analyses, partitioned sup-
port indices may also be of interest in a likelihood
framework (e.g., Lee & Hugall 2003 Sys. Bio.).
New features in version 3: 1.) TreeRot.v3 has been
recoded in Perl and should now run on any operating
system! 2.) TreeRot.v3 provides added functionality
in the context of partitioned analyses (see Lambkin et
al. 2002 Cladistics). 3). TreeRot.v3 outputs decay in-
dices embedded in a NEXUS format tree for easy view-
ing/formatting in FigTree ( http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/-
software/ﬁgtree/).
The code for the new version is all new, so please let
me know if you run into any diﬃculties.

Tree algorithm patent
I stumbled onto this patent listing on BioInform and,well, was taken aback by it:
US Patent 7,254,489. Systems, methods and appa-
ratus for reconstructing phylogentic trees. Inventor:
Elchanan Mossel. Assignee: Microsoft.
Covers a method for reconstructing a tree data struc-
ture by reconstructing a local topology from samples of
data of known nodes, and estimating the data value of
each node in the reconstructed local topology. The re-
constructing and estimating are performed iteratively.
More details at: http://www.freepatentsonline.com/-
7254489.html I don’t know enough about patents to
know if this is even something to worry about. The
disclosure of the algorithm is quite diﬃcult to read...
It references a Hendy et al article in 1994 but surely
there’s work that predates 1994 that might be consid-
ered prior art...

US Federal Funds Earmarked For
CreationScienceEducation
For those of you in the US or with ties to the US:
Sen. David Vitter, R-La, has earmarked $100,000 in
federal money to go to a religious group, the Louisiana
Family Forum, “to develop a plan to promote better
science education.” This is the same group that suc-
cessfully lobbied the Ouachita (La) School Board to
adopt an anti-evolution education policy.
According to the Times-Picayune: “The group’s stated
mission is to ’persuasively present biblical principles
in the centers of inﬂuence on issues aﬀecting the fam-
ily through research, communication and networking.’
Until recently, its Web site contained a ’battle plan to
combat evolution,’ which called the theory a ’danger-
ous’ concept that ’has no place in the classroom.’ The
document was removed after a reporter’s inquiry.”
It looks like the Louisiana Family Forum knows that
getting tax-payer money to promote religion in pub-
lic schools and corrupt science education is unconstitu-
tional and illegal. They are trying to cover their tracks.
The earmark is on page 238 of the report of the “De-
partments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill,
2008” [link: http://tinyurl.com/yp24ﬀ] . The bill70 EvolDir October 1, 2007
hasn’t been acted on yet, and there is time to remove
the earmark. Please contact your senators asking them
to remove the earmark and/or redirect the money to an
organization in Louisiana that could actually improve
science education in the state.
Thank you.

US Federal Funds Earmarked For
CreationScienceEducation 2
To U.S. citizens who want to do something about the
Vitter earmark: It is important to include the number
of the Senate Bill to which the earmark is attached (S
1710). Also, be sure to state the purpose of the let-
ter ﬁrst, with the arguments after. This helps the staﬀ
categorize the letter appropriately by topic and by your
position is on the issue.
Here is an example (with thanks to Reed Cartwright
for most of the text):
Honorable Senator Feinstein:
Sen. David Vitter, R-La, has earmarked $100,000 in
federal money to go to a religious group, the Louisiana
Family Forum, “to develop a plan to promote better
science education.” This is the same group that suc-
cessfully lobbied the Ouachita (La) School Board to
adopt an anti-evolution education policy.
Please remove the earmark and/or redirect the money
to an organization in Louisiana that could actually im-
prove science education in the state. The earmark ison page 238 of the report of the “Departments of La-
bor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and
Related Agencies Appropriation Bill, 2008 Report on
the Committee on Appropriations U.S. Senate on S
1710” [link: http://tinyurl.com/yp24ﬀ] . According to
the Times-Picayune: “The group’s stated mission is to
’persuasively present biblical principles in the centers
of inﬂuence on issues aﬀecting the family through re-
search, communication and networking.’ Until recently,
its Web site contained a ’battle plan to combat evo-
lution,’ which called the theory a ’dangerous’ concept
that ’has no place in the classroom.’ The document
was removed after a reporter’s inquiry.”
It appears that the Louisiana Family Forum knows that
getting tax-payer money to promote religion in pub-
lic schools and corrupt science education is unconstitu-
tional and illegal. They are trying to cover their tracks.
It is important for the security of the United States that
students in Louisiana and the United States as a whole
not have their science education corrupted and diluted
by introduction of religious doctrine in the form of “cre-
ation science,” “intelligent design,” or other dogma-
driven formulas that fail to use the scientiﬁc method.

USLibraryCongress petition
All:
The graduate students at my institution have created
an online petition to reclassify non-science books from
science categories in bookstores and libraries. To quote
from the ﬁrst paragraph of their petition:
“As scientists, we feel strongly that categorizing Intel-
ligent Design (”ID“) as science is both inappropriate
and misleading. Local bookstores and libraries uninten-
tionally exacerbate this misleading categorization when
they shelve ID books and legitimate science texts in the
same section . Our goal is to convince the U.S. Library
of Congress to re-classify ID books into sections other
than the science section.”
If this is something about which you feel strongly
(or even are lukewarm!), I urge you to support theirOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 71

INRA Bordeaux OakGenomics
The postdoctoral fellow will explore pangenomic ap-
proaches for deciphering species delineation in the
case of white oak species (Quercus petraea and Quer-
cus robur). The study will combine systematic ge-
nomic scans of nucleotide diﬀerentiation between the
two species, and QTL mapping of phenotypic traits
showing species variation. A major contribution will
consist in the bioinformatic analysis of 2000 ampli-
cons that will be resequenced in samples of the two
species. The amplicons are selected within the tran-
scribed fraction of the genome, obtained from exist-
ing EST libraries ( 50 000 sequences) correspondingto bud, leaf, root and xylem tissues. Microsynteny
with other woody plant genomes (Populus and Vitis)
may allow to identify the homologous counterpart of
chromosomal regions corresponding to hot spots of dif-
ferentiation, and focus the scan within these regions.
Similarly existing data of QTL for traits exhibiting
high level of species diﬀerentiation (interspeciﬁc Qst)
will be compiled. A ﬁnal comparison of QTL posi-
tion and scans of nucleotide diﬀerentiation will allow
to reﬁne the distribution of species diﬀerentiation at
the whole genome level. The position is opened for
one year, starting January 1st 2008. The fellowship is
granted by the ANR project $B!H(BTranspeciﬁc func-
tional and neutral diversity in model species$B!I(B.

HeliconiusConvergentEvol
Postdoc Position- Developmental architecture of con-
vergent evolution in Heliconius wing patterns
Project Description: A one-year postdoctoral fellow-
ship is available to conduct microarray experiments ex-
amining the developmental architecture of phenotypic
convergence in Heliconius. This is an exciting oppor-
tunity to use newly created oligonucleotide microarrays
to study temporal and spatial variation in gene expres-
sion during the development of convergent wing pat-
tern phenotypes in H. erato and H. melpomene. The
two co-mimics are distantly related, yet possess nearly
identical wing patterns and have undergone paralleland congruent radiations into over 20 geographic races.
The combination of fantastic natural variation, strong
history of ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary re-
search, and growing genomic resources makes Helico-
nius ideal for integrative research studying the inter-
face between genomes, development, and the ecology
and evolution of adaptive phenotypes
The research is a collaboration between Owen McMil-
lan at North Carolina State University, Chris Jiggins
at Cambridge University, Fred Nijhout at Duke Uni-
versity and Bob Reed at UC-Irvine. The postdoc will
be responsible for conducting and analyzing microarray
experiments. In addition, the researcher can expect to
spend time collecting butterﬂies in South America and
conducting experiments at our Heliconius Rearing Fa-

Carver Center for Comparative Genomics <http://-
ccg.biology.uiowa.edu/ >University of Iowa, Iowa City
Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position to
work on a recently-funded research project to study the
molecular evolution of sex and meiosis in Fungi. TheOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 81
position is available for two years, with extension possi-
ble. The research will involve a combination of molecu-
lar biology and bioinformatic analyses. The ideal candi-
date will be able to conduct research using both3wet2
and3dry2approaches; particularly strong applicants
who primarily use one of these methods will also be
considered. The technical and intellectual environment
at the Roy J. Carver Center for Comparative Genomics
(CCG) is excellent for both molecular evolutionary and
evolution of sex research. The selected candidate will
be part of a highly interactive group in the Logsdon
lab who are studying various aspects of the origins and
evolution of meiosis.
Project Summary: We will survey available fungal
genomes to ﬁnd and characterize homologs of all genes
known to be involved in meiosis and essential for sex.
For these meiotic genes, we will compare their se-
quences and determine their evolutionary histories. We
will also isolate and analyze a subset of ~10 of these
meiotic genes from ~20 additional fungal species repre-
senting key fungal groups whose genomes are not being
sequenced. In several of these species, sex has not been
observed. These results will provide the ﬁrst compre-
hensive analysis of the evolution of genes needed for sex
in any eukaryotic kingdom and will provide genetic evi-
dence to determine if some fungi thought to be asexual
are capable of sex.
Qualiﬁcations: PhD in Biology or related ﬁeld. Ex-
perience in molecular biology. Expertise in mycology
and/or bioinformatics is strongly desired.
Contact: John Logsdon, Associate Professor and CCG
Director, <john-logsdon@uiowa.edu >Please send as

Postdoctoral Position to Explore Evolution in the Deep
Sea
Applications are invited for an NSF funded postdoc-
toral position in the laboratories of Ron Etter and Mike
Rex at the University of Massachusetts/Boston to ex-
plore evolution in deep-sea organisms.
This project, funded by the National Science Founda-
tion (NSF), will sample the bathyal and abyssal fauna
of the Western North Atlantic along a transect from
Massachusetts (USA) to Bermuda. Our aim is to quan-
tify patterns of genetic variation in deep-sea mollusks
to test several hypotheses about where and how evo-
lution has unfolded in this remote ecosystem. During
the last several decades, much has been learned aboutOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 83
spatial variation of species diversity and its possible
ecological causes. The evolutionary origin, radiation
and geographic spread of this rich and highly endemic
fauna remain virtually unknown. Our work will speciﬁ-
cally address questions on a) the geographic and bathy-
metric scales of population diﬀerentiation and specia-
tion, b) the nature and scale of isolating barriers, c)
the role of evolution in creating geographic and bathy-
metric variation in biodiversity and d) the colonization
and radiations within the deep Atlantic. The successful
candidate will be expected to contribute to all aspects
of this project.
Applicants should have a strong history of molecular
genetic work, experience with phylogenetic and pop-
ulation genetic tools, and experience analyzing large,
multivariate data sets. Applicants who have completed
or anticipate completing their Ph.D. before December
2007 are desired. Please submit by e-mail (1) a cover
letter describing your background and experience in
molecular genetics, (2) a curriculum vitae, (3) a state-
ment of research interests, and (4) the names and ad-
dresses (including e-mail addresses) of three references

EvolOfSymbioticInteractions
Postdoctoral Research Position - Evolution of complex
symbiotic interactions The goal of this research is to
understand coevolutionary interactions in the context
of community spatial structure. While most theoretical
and empirical studies address two-species interactions,
recent results demonstrate that co-occurring species
can dramatically aﬀect the outcome of such interac-
tions. Speciﬁcally, we will examine the interactions of
maize, a common pathogen (Ustilago maydis), and two
endophytic fungal species (Fusarium verticillioides, F.
graminearum). These fungal and plants systems are
well-characterized model organisms and the methods
for studying interactions have been developed. In ﬁeldand greenhouse environments, we will use genomic and
metabolic approaches to determine underlying mecha-
nisms of species interactions, examine variation in those
traits, and determine ﬁtness outcomes of varying inter-
actions. The study represents a collaboration of Dr.
Georgiana May, Dr. H. Corby Kistler, and Dr. Bob
Haight (modeling) at the University of Minnesota.
Inquiries for should be directed to Georgiana May

Applications are invited from suitably qualiﬁed persons
for the position of Postdoctoral Fellow in the Depart-
ment of Zoology. This position is funded by a grant
from the Marsden Fund to Professor Robert Poulin and
Dr Devon Keeney, and is available for three years.
The appointee will have expertise in molecular ecology,
particularly with microsatellite markers; experience in
experimental parasitology would be an important asset
but is not essential.
Our research programme aims to investigate the key
factors inﬂuencing the evolution of host speciﬁcity in
parasites. More speciﬁcally, the research will exam-
ine how plasticity in phenotype (morphology and be-
haviour) and genetic variation aﬀect the ability of para-
sites to exploit novel hosts. Using a native New Zealand
marine trematode (parasitic ﬂatworm) species that in-
fects coastal crustaceans as an experimental model, this
work will combine experimental parasitology and ge-
netic analyses to break new ground in our understand-
ing of the factors inﬂuencing the ecology of resource
utilization and the evolution of parasitic diseases.
Applicants must have completed a PhD and have pre-
vious scientiﬁc publications in a relevant ﬁeld. We wish
to ﬁll this position by February 2008 or soon thereafter.

Academic-related Research Staﬀ Grade 7: Salary
£26,666 to £32,796 (bar) per annum
A ﬁxed-term research position of 2 years duration,
funded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is available to work
in the research group of Dr Jonathan Marchini, on
statistical issues in modern genetic studies, with spe-
ciﬁc application to genome-wide datasets generated by
GSK. The ideal start date would be 1 December 2007,
or at a later date by arrangement. The well-qualiﬁedsuccessful applicant is likely to be appointed at or near
the top of the salary scale given above.
GSK has assembled large case-control collections for
many important and common diseases. These include
major psychiatric, neurological, metabolic, and cardio-
vascular diseases. The samples are typically comprised
of roughly 1000 cases and 1000 controls, and usually
have rich phenotypic characterisation beyond the stan-
dard diagnosis of disease, including, for example, di-
agnostic subtypes, and quantitative measures derived
from imaging or in-depth secondary assessment of pa-
tients. GSK has also collected epidemiological samples
and a limited number of family-based samples, also with
rich phenotypic assessment. Many of these collections
are being, or will shortly be, genotyped genome-wide at
hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms, with the aim
of performing association analysis and identifying genes
that modify susceptibility to these diseases. The aim of
both projects will be to take advantage of the rich phe-
notypic characterisation of the GSK samples, together
with joint analysis with other comparable datasets that
are currently becoming available via the academic sec-
tor. These analyses will be more powerful for identify-
ing genes involved in common diseases than analysing
the main diagnostic classiﬁcation within GSK samples
alone. However, these advanced analyses will require
the development of novel methodologies in statistical
genetics. The successful applicant will work on devel-
oping analysis methods for distinct datasets provided
by GSK. The appointee will work under the direction
of Dr Jonathan Marchini.
Candidates should have: A strong background in mod-
ern statistics and its application, or a related ﬁeld Good

The postdoctoral fellow will be mainly located in the
ﬁrst laboratory (in Orsay, near Paris), but will be in
strong interaction with the people from the two other
laboratories in Avignon and Bordeaux. The position
requires solid experience in computer science (in par-
ticular C programming), as well as in population and
quantitative genetics. All candidates should then a mo-
tivation letter, a CV and the name and email of three
references by email to Frederic Austerlitz before Octo-
ber 5th. Do not hesitate also to contact him in casemore details are needed.
The aim of the postdoctoral work would be to develop
models that account for changes in environmental con-
ditions through time. To this extent, populations or
metapopulations of individuals will be simulated. The
individuals will be characterized by their phenotype for
several adaptive traits, these traits being coded by sev-
eral loci. The model will consider diﬀerent possibili-
ties for the relation between genotypes and phenotypes,
including the possibility of pleitropy (involvement of
a given gene in several traits). Diﬀerent scenarios of
climatic changes will be considered by allowing diﬀer-
ent model parameters to vary for one or several of the
adaptive traits (e.g. variation of the optimal pheno-
type across time, for diﬀerent intensities and time steps)
or the quality of the environment. The impact of the
diﬀerent scenarios of climatic changes retained will be
assessed on both phenotypic and genetic responses of
populations.
The study will focus both on a local scale using
the spatially-explicit individual-based software CAP-
SIS (Dreyfus et al., 2005) and a larger scale using
the software METAPOP (Le Corre et al., 1997 ; Le
Corre et Kremer, 2003) that considers panmictic pop-
ulations connected by gene ﬂow. Regarding the global
scale, while the basic simulation framework is already
implemented in METAPOP, the postdoctoral fellow
will have to modify the source code in order to deal
speciﬁcally with the questions addressed here, namely
the implementation of scenarios of changes across time
and the possibility to model several traits simultane-
ously. He/she will then be able to compare the re-
sults of METAPOP with the results of simulations per-
formed at the local scale with CAPSIS, in which the
expression of a phenotypic trait, and thus the relation
between phenotype and ﬁtness depends explicitly on
spatial position of individuals through a demographic
model. This demographic model describes explicitly
how an individual with a given genotype in a given
environment will survive, reproduce or disperse. The
postdoctoral fellow will not be directly involved in the
modiﬁcation of the source code of CAPSIS but he/she
will participate in the methodological choices of how in-
troducing directional variation of the environment qual-
ity, and in the analyses of the simulations performed
with this software.
The parameters of the simulations (e.g. seed and pollen
dispersal curves, number of loci involved in the traits,
quality of the environment ) will be calibrated with data
from the intensive study sites (ISS) of EVOLTREE and
from the literature.

A postdoctoral position is available in the group of
Dustin Brisson at the University of Pennsylvania, to
study the ecology and evolution of Borrelia burgdor-
feri, the causative agent of Lyme disease.
The project aims to address the causes of variation in
host and pathogen populations and their consequences
to evolution and public health. We are addressing these
issues by a combination of laboratory, ﬁeld, and com-
putational studies. This study will integrate across
three scales of biological complexity - molecular-level,
organism-level, and population-level - to identify the
molecular and ecological mechanisms maintaining the
polymorphism at a protein exposed on the bacterial sur-
face and to determine the consequences of these mecha-
nisms on the distribution and abundance of B. burgdor-
feri and on human Lyme disease risk.
The position requires a highly motivated, enthusiastic,
and enquiring individual with a background in evo-
lutionary biology, ecology, statistics, or related ﬁelds.
Molecular and ﬁeld experience would be advantageous.
Good quantitative skills are essential.
The University of Pennsylvania has a strong group of
evolutionary biologists and ecologists in the biology de-
partment that frequently interact with each other and
with an accomplished group of microbiologists in the
Medical and Veterinary schools.

oratory of Dr. Adalgisa (Gisella) Caccone to work on
evolutionary genetics of the tsetse ﬂy Glossina fuscipes
and the second position is in the laboratory of Dr. Ak-
soy to work on the population biology and associated
functions of tsetse symbionts. The aim of the research
is to understand the patterns of genetic diﬀerentiation
of tsetse populations on a spatial and temporal scale to
help develop strategies for eﬀective vector control. To-
wards this overall goal we are also interested in studying
levels of genetic diﬀerentiation of the maternally trans-
mitted symbionts (Wolbachia, Wigglesworthia and So-
dalis) and parasite (Trypanosoma) and how they re-
late to the genetic structuring of tsetse populations.
A Ph.D. demonstrated expertise in evolutionary genet-
ics and phylogeography, phylogenetics (bacterial phylo-
genetics for the symbionts-focused position), including
ability to collect nuclear and mitochondrial DNA se-
quence data, cloning and analyzing microsatellite data
is required. Previous research experience in evolution-
ary genetics of insect populations and symbionts, with
especially disease vectors, is preferred. The positions
include ﬁeld work in Uganda for sampling, coordina-tion, and training at the Livestock Health Research
Institute in Uganda (LIRI). Independence, good orga-
nizational ability, and the capacity to work eﬀectively
in a multidisciplinary and international team are very
important traits of the successful candidate. The posi-
tions are available for at least 2 years. The preferred
starting date is January 1, 2008. To apply please send

POST-Doc positions: evolutionary genetics of tsetse
ﬂies, its symbionts, and parasites
Two postdoctoral positions are available from January
2008 at Yale University. The ﬁrst position is in the lab-
oratory of Dr. Adalgisa (Gisella) Caccone to work on
evolutionary genetics of the tsetse ﬂy Glossina fuscipes
and the second position is in the laboratory of Dr. Ak-
soy to work on the population biology and associated
functions of tsetse symbionts. The aim of the research
is to understand the patterns of genetic diﬀerentiation
of tsetse populations on a spatial and temporal scale to
help develop strategies for eﬀective vector control. To-
wards this overall goal we are also interested in studying
levels of genetic diﬀerentiation of the maternally trans-
mitted symbionts (Wolbachia, Wigglesworthia and So-
dalis) and parasite (Trypanosoma) and how they re-
late to the genetic structuring of tsetse populations.
A Ph.D. demonstrated expertise in evolutionary genet-
ics and phylogeography, phylogenetics (bacterial phylo-
genetics for the symbionts-focused position), including90 EvolDir October 1, 2007
ability to collect nuclear and mitochondrial DNA se-
quence data, cloning and analyzing microsatellite data
is required. Previous research experience in evolution-
ary genetics of insect populations and symbionts, with
especially disease vectors, is preferred. The positions
include ﬁeld work in Uganda for sampling, coordina-
tion, and training at the Livestock Health Research
Institute in Uganda (LIRI). Independence, good orga-
nizational ability, and the capacity to work eﬀectively
in a multidisciplinary and international team are very
important traits of the successful candidate. The posi-
tions are available for at least 2 years. The preferred

IRIS Post Doctoral Fellowship
Applications are invited for a two-year Post-doctoral
Fellowship based at York University?s Institute for Re-
search and Innovation in Sustainability (IRIS) to ad-
dress inter-disciplinary research issues pertaining to
invasive non-indigenous species (NIS). The successful
candidate will have a PhD or equivalent in the so-
cial sciences, law, business or natural sciences, with a
record of scholarship and communication, plus an inter-
est in environmental issues management. York Univer-
sity has identiﬁed invasive species as an important area
for research and innovation, and the successful candi-
date will be expected to enhance our capacity on this
topic. There will be opportunities to collaborate with
the environmental scientists that are assessing the risk
of NIS in Canada, as well as government and NGO
staﬀ charged with developing relevant policies. It isanticipated that the successful candidate will advance
our understanding of the inter-disciplinary nature of
the NIS issue, as well as develop practical suggestions
for public policy initiatives that would help ameliorate
the threats they pose. Speciﬁc engineering or technical
protocols to deal with individual invading species (e.g.
zebra mussels, emerald ash borer, etc.) are beyond the
scope of work.
This position provides a unique opportunity to ex-
plore current social, legal, political, economic and/or
ﬁscal constraints to the wise management of Canadian
ecosystems posed by the introduction and spread of
NIS. We anticipate that the successful candidate will
address challenges posed by Canada?s recent National
Invasive Alien Species Strategy, which recognizes both
the ecological and economic threats posed by NIS. Mod-
est funds will be available to foster these collaborations.

Unique Opportunity for Ten Undergraduates Ecologi-92 EvolDir October 1, 2007
cal Genetics Field Study Abroad in China
With funding from NSF’s Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, we are
oﬀering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens) the opportu-
nity to participate in a unique study abroad opportu-
nity in China this summer.
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic bio-
geographic study of species that are native to China
and invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a grow-
ing number of species native to the southeastern U.S.
and invasive in China. Each summer, we will run an
8 week OTS-style ﬁeld course where we will visit bio-
logical communities throughout China. After the ﬁeld
course, students can elect to continue in short-term re-
search internships in our partner labs in China, Taiwan
and Hong Kong.
Of course, students will need to be prepared to take
full advantage of this experience. Each spring semester,
undergraduates will enroll at the University of Georgia
(UGA) and take 3 courses; two in intensive elementary
Mandarin Chinese and a laboratory course in genetics.
There are no prerequisites for these courses and no prior
experience with Chinese language is expected.
The cost to the student is minimal: the grant will cover
travel to and within China, lodging and most meals.
The student is responsible for visa costs and personal
expenses.
The application deadline is November 9, but we encour-
age any interested students to contact us immediately.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subjectOctober 1, 2007 EvolDir 95
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
