(case sensitive) Brief description: Southern Connec-
tions is a large group of scientists from all continents
who study aspects of biology and earth history of the
Southern Continents. Previous meetings have taken
place in Australia, New Zealand and Chile. This will
be a chance for scientists to experience the other major
Southern Connector, southern Africa, and to continue
and build on their interactions, discussions and collab-
orations concerning this bit of Gondwana. The theme
in 2004 will be “Towards a Southern Perspective”. The
literature in most ﬁelds of biology is dominated by a
northern perspective. One of the main aims of South-
ern Connections is to develop and emphasise diﬀerences
between North and South. Africa, for example, with
its long history of hominids and its relatively well pre-
served megafauna, is a stark contrast to most of the
Northern Hemisphere. Besides this theme there will be
several other more speciﬁc themes relating to, for exam-
ple, ecology, forest ecology, paleontology, applied ecol-
ogy, ethno botany, forest management, zoology (ﬁshes,
birds, etc), arid land ecology, biodiversity management,
community issues, biogeography, phylogeny, phylogeog-
raphy, history and utilization. A common thread is the
Gondwana link.

JyvaskylaU SexualSelection
a graduate student position in Jyvaskyla University,
Finland:
The thesis work deals with phenotypic (morphological
traits, male courtship songs and female song prefer-
ences) variation within and between Drosophila mon-
tana populations and its consequences in the con-
text of sexual selection. This species is of a special
interest in evolutionary studies as it has genetically
(and morphologically) diverged populations on diﬀer-
ent continents, and as the females of this species have
very high requirements with respect to male courtshipAugust 1, 2003 EvolDir 5
song quality. A phylogeographic analysis of D. mon-
tana populations presently being made within an EU
Research training Network, will provide a theoretical
framework for the interpretation of the patterns of
chromosomal, morphological and behavioural variation
among populations. The graduate student may also
take part in studies on the role of chromosomal re-
arrangements in creating reproductive barriers (espe-
cially behavioural changes) via position eﬀect, reduced
levels of recombination and selective sweeps in poly-
morphic populations of the species. The work can be
started at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland 1.9.2003
or later. If you are interested in participating into
this kind of research, please contact Dr. Dominique

To work with Rick E. Miller Assistant Professor of
Plant Evolutionary Genetics
I recently received funding (Louisiana Board of Re-
gents) for a masters student to work in my lab on a
project that combines an investigation of the evolution-
ary ecology of seed size and seed number with a study
of morning glory systematics. This research program
integrates studies of selection and constraints on eco-
logically important traits with research on the molec-
ular phylogenetics of a diverse and species-rich group
of plants. There are a wide variety of masters projects
that would make suitable contributions to this research
program including greenhouse studies, ﬁeld studies, and
molecular work.
The Department of Biological Sciences at Southeastern
Louisiana University includes an active group of sci-
entists with strengths in evolutionary biology, system-
atics, and molecular evolution (B. Crother, M. White,
W. Font, K. Piller, C. Fontenot), ecology (P. Keddy, C.
Jackson, G. Schaﬀer), and microbiology (G. Childers,
G. Howard).

UDublin Supertrees
Title: Large trees, supertrees and the grass phylogeny:
a high performance computing approach (funded by
Enterprise Ireland)
Department of Botany and Trinity Centre for High
Performance Computing, University of Dublin, Trin-
ity College, Ireland Jodrell Laboratory, Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew, UK
A three year PhD studentship is available to work
on a collaborative research project between TCD and
the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. The student will
work under the supervision of the project principal
researcher, Dr Trevor Hodkinson ( http://www.tcd.ie/-
Botany/Staﬀ/THodkinson ), Dr Nicolas Salamin, Univ.
of Washington, ( http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/-
salamin ), Dr Vincent Savolainen, Royal Botanic
Gardens Kew, and Professor James Sexton, Di-
rector of the Trinity Center for High Perfor-
mance Computing ( http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/-
oﬃcial/StaﬀPages/sexton ).
The project aims, with the aid of high performance
computing, to produce comprehensive phylogenetic
trees of the whole grass family, by using multi-gene
analyses and meta-analysis approaches such as su-
pertrees. The information from these large phyloge-
netic trees will be used to study macroevolutionary andphylogenomic processes and for systematic purposes.
The grasses are one of the largest families of higher
plant and are undoubtedly the most important from an
economic perspective, representing four of the world top
ﬁve crops. These comprehensive phylogenetic trees will
be an essential tool in understanding grass evolution.
The student will be expected to a) generate new DNA
sequence data to contribute to existing data sets to pro-
duce large matrices for phylogenetic analyses based on
multiple genes and b) utilise existing data for phylo-
genetic and phylogenomic purposes, employing state of
the art high performance computers. It is anticipated
that the student will travel to the Royal Botanic Gar-
dens Kew on numerous occasions to generate fresh data
and to other countries to collect plants and attend inter-
national conferences. The student will become part of
an active and successful research group working on the
grass family and the phylogenetics of large and speciose
groups. It will link closely with worldwide initiatives to
assemble a comprehensive ’Tree of Life’ using DNA se-
quence information.
The student will be based at Trinity College and receive
an annual stipend of 15,000-18,000 Euro for mainte-
nance and to cover university fees. Fees are approxi-
mately 4,000 Euro for EU students or 8,000 Euro for
non-EU students. There will be opportunities to get ex-
tra money teaching and demonstrating on undergradu-
ate courses.
To apply or to obtain further information, please
send a CV including research interests and con-
tact details of two referees and a letter of mo-
tivation to trevor.hodkinson@tcd.ie with copy to

Ph.D. STUDENT POSITION ON ecological genetics
of Chironomus
A Ph.D. Student Position is available in a project
funded by a Baden-W¨ urttemberg Program (BWPLUS;
Lebensgrundlage Umwelt und ihre Sicherung).August 1, 2003 EvolDir 7
The project will test whether local adaptation or
stochastic processes (e.g. genetic drift) in Chirono-
mus mediate microevolutionary change. Natural pop-
ulations will be subjected to diﬀerent levels of toxic
substances (TBT and cadmium) for several generations
and changes in genetic diversity will me monitored over
time. Life-history experiments will be conducted to as-
sess the variation in quantitative traits. Parallel, an
extensive genetic analysis will reveal levels of variation
in neutral genetic markers among populations. Com-
paring spatial genetic variation with genetic variation
in ecological relevant (quantitative) traits will allow to
test hypotheses on local adaptation and determine long-
term population genetic eﬀects of chemical contamina-
tion.
The successful candidate should have the equivalent of
a master’s degree or Diplom in Biology, a ﬁrm back-
ground in evolutionary ecology, and a strong commit-
ment to basic research. The position is available ini-
tially for two years, with likely extension for maximum
one further year. Salary and conditions are according
to the German BAT-IIa/2 scale for civil servants.
A complete application should include a curriculum
vitae, a description of the MSc or Diplom research,
and the names (address/phone/fax/e-mail) of two refer-
ences, and be sent to Dr. Klaus Schwenk, Department
of Ecology & Evolution J.W. Goethe-University Frank-

UWindsor SalmonGenetics
Graduate Studentship in Salmon Gene Expres-
sion/Genomics. A funded Ph.D. or M.Sc. posi-
tion is available immediately to study the impact of
triploidization on chinook salmon. The position is
a collaborative venture between faculty members at
the University of Windsor, UBC, UNBC, and aqua-
culture companies on Vancouver Island. The student
will study the eﬀect of dosage compensation and over-
all gene expression on salmon performance, possibly fo-
cussing on disease resistance. A critical component of
the project involves using salmon DNA chips for mi-
croarray analysis of gene expression diﬀerences between
diploid and triploid salmon. Ideally, students should
have some molecular biology experience together with
an understanding of fundamental genetic mechanisms
and preferably some ﬁsh biology, although we are pre-
pared to train otherwise qualiﬁed candidates.
Please send your C.V. to either Dr. Adnan
Ali (aali@uwindsor.ca), Dr. Andrew Hubber-
stey (ahubber@uwindsor.ca) or Dr. Daniel Heath

Francisco Bay area), has an opening for a Senior Re-
search Associate.
The JGI is a high-throughput genomics center with
extensive laboratory and computer facilities, currently
producing more than 1,800 million nucleotides of DNA
sequence per month (about 50,000 nt per minute). The
JGI has produced random shotgun, high depth draft
sequences of the puﬀer ﬁsh Fugu, the tunicate Ciona,
the fungi Phanerochaete and Trichoderma, the green
alga Chlamydomonas, the diatom Thalassiosira, and
dozens of prokaryotes. Several other large-scale genome
projects are underway, including those of the poplar
tree, the frog Xenopus, two species of the basidiomycete
Phakopsora, two species of the oomycete Phytophthora,and scores of other prokaryotes, including community
microbial sequencing.
Within the JGI, the Evolutionary Genomics Depart-
ment is a team of molecular evolutionary biologists fo-
cusing on numerous aspects of genome evolution using
these and other publicly available genome sequences, as

search Associate. It is expected that this person will
function as a full member of the Department, partici-
pating in all aspects of a project, from design to publi-
cation, to the limit of his/her ability. There will be sub-
stantial opportunities for training and professional de-
velopment. This person will regularly collaborate with
other scientists within and outside of the JGI.

the lab or primarily computational or a combination
of both. Examples of the type of work that may be
undertaken include (1) performing computerized anal-
yses of DNA and amino acid sequences, genome struc-
ture, etc.; (2) writing computer code for comparative
genomics projects; (3) performing PCR ampliﬁcation,
cloning in plasmid, cosmid, or BAC vectors, hybridiza-
tion, and other molecular biology techniques; and (4)
improving and developing laboratory protocols.
The person selected will have these qualiﬁcations: (1)
B.S. in Biology or Computer Science or related ﬁeld
(M.S. desired); (2) Either broad experience in a variety
of laboratory techniques or strong programming skills,

Asteraceae NuclearGenes
Other: Nuclear genes in the Asteraceae We are work-
ing on the genus Senecio (Asteraceae) with the aim
of determining origins of a number of polyploids. We
are hoping to be able to sequence single-copy (or low
copy) nuclear genes such as Adh, PgiC, CHS, Tpi and
have met with limited success. Our searching so far has
found that studies using these genes have been carried
out in distantly related species, eg cotton or rice, and
suspect the primers will not work. We would therefore
like to hear from anyone who has used these genes in
a species related to Senecio and any information about
primers would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks in

Bonferroni correction
Dear all, I recently had a problem while applying Bon-
ferroni correction (Rice, 1989) to pairwise Fst values on
a “large” set of data: The p value is so small that almost
none of the values remain signiﬁcant after that correc-tion (the p value become less than 1/1000). However,
it looks like this is a very conservative way of trying to
avoid type I errors, and it actually may induce a very
high amount of type II errors. It seems to me that it
should be a real source of concern when analysing large
dataset, and then potentially loosing a lot of important
information. However, I still see a lot of studies using
it and not interpreting the values that are not signiﬁ-
cant after Bonferroni correction. Moreover, in a lot of
cases, it looks like you would then have more chance to
keep your value signiﬁcant while reducing your dataset,
which is quite unusual. I did not ﬁnd, so far, a lot of ref-
erences trying to estimate the problem Bonferroni could
induce in terms of type II errors. I heared only about
one good reference on this: Sachs, L. 1980. Applied
statistics: a hanbook of techniques. Springer-Verlag.
New York. but I could not ﬁnd it. I would like to ask
you if some of you would have this reference, or another
one reporting strong points and weakness of Bonferroni
correction, or a personal advice, I would be interested
in hearing from you. Thanks Sophie

Bonferroni correction answers
Dear all, I received a lot of interesting comments, sug-
gestions and references following my request on Evoldir
about Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. It seems
to be an important source of debate, thinking and in-
terest for a lot of people. Here below is the compilation
of the personal comments that I have been sent, and,
at the end, a list of useful references I received. Thanks
again to all the people who kindly answered and sent
information Sophie
## I have been doing association studies with the most
polymorphic expressed genetic system, the HLA loci.
Multiple comparisons is a painful issue in my research
and I have had several papers rejected early in my ca-
reer with a simple statement that “correction for mul-
tiple comparisons was not made and the results are in-
valid.” Now in a later phase in my career (and as a
reviewer myself), I see this more as an excuse for aAugust 1, 2003 EvolDir 19
busy referee to avoid a comprehensive review. I got so
fed up that I educated myself and created my own web-
page on statistical analysis of HLA association studies
with particular emphasis on multiple comparisons is-
sue:http://home.att.net/˜dorak/stat.html Please have
a look at this page and you will see an extensive dis-
cussion of this issue with a lot of references. The two
that speciﬁcally discuss type II errors are those rather
accessible ones:
## I feel that the best way of dealing with the prob-
lem is simply decreasing the number of tests. I ﬁnd
that a matrix of pairwise p-values mostly provides only
little insight, and it’s more useful to perform an hierar-
chical Fst-analysis, which is also more powerful (make
biologically meaningful groups of populations and test
between them). This also gives a better estimate of
Fst as it will be averaged over several populations. If
you do not have logical groupings, but do have a lot
of populations, you might wanna try Jerome Goudet’s
PCAGEN method. Nevertheless, I also acknowledge
the fact that it is sometimes inevitable to look at the
pairwise matrix.
## I have no answer for the question you posted on
Evoldir (except that I think it depends on what you
want: if you want to examine candidates for something,
you don’t need Bonferroni; if you want to be sure that
an individual observation is signiﬁcant, there is no way
around it).
However, I’d be very interested in the responses you
get. It would be great if you could either post them on
Evoldir, or send me a copy of those that you ﬁnd most
useful
## am sorry i cannot help, but i have thought about
the same problem when correcting our own data sets.
I refrained to correcting only within small units of the
analysis but not the entire table. In the article towards
the end Rice ask to apply the correction within the cor-
rect unit and leaves you some space for interpretation
(as i interpreted it).
However, if units are larger i really wonder whether
the technique is wise anymore. If you get good ad-
vise or/and come to an interesting conclusion yourself,
please let me know!
## What you have seen is correct, as is Bonferroni.
There is a penalty that we must pay when we want to
ask a lot of questions on the same data, that is just the
nature of statistical inference. Perhaps instead of ask-
ing the same question in a pair-wise fashion amongst
your K(K-1)/2 data points, you can ask more direct
questions of all data simultaneously and thus only loose
a single degree of freedom. I can’t provide any more in-sights since I don’t know the domain of your question
you are using Fst to answer. If you’d like to discuss it
further, drop me a line.
## You might want to try the Dunn-Sidak version of
the sequential Bonferroni correction, which is slightly
less conservative than the usual Bonferroni. A descrip-
tion of it can be found on page 241 of
Sokal, R. R. and F. J. Rohlf. 1995. Biometry. New
York: W. H. Freeman.
Regarding your more general question about the loss
of information due to correction for multiple compar-
ison, you have to decide in the context of the speciﬁc
statistical tests you are conducting whether type I or
type II errors are more important. If you are screening
for carriers of a disease, making a type II error is worse
(because you will miss some carriers and allow the dis-
ease to spread), but if you are comparing the eﬀects of a
new medication to a placebo, a type I error is worse (be-
cause you would approve a medication that is no better
than placebo). So, the interpretation for your own data
set would depend on the context–more controversial re-
sults would warrant a more conservative interpretation
of the statistics, more mundane results might give you
some more wiggle-room.
## I had the same sorts of questions while looking at
coevolution in proteins (Pollock et al, JMB 1999). I
had thousands of comparisons, and the Bonferroni cor-
rection requires a 95% probability of for the statistic

FTA cards testimonials answers
Here is a summary of the information I received back
from list members after asking for advice on collecting
blood using FTA Whatman cards. I was not able to
get whatman cards in time for my recent ﬁeld collect-
ing trip, so I used the Whatman ﬁlter paper for some
samples and lysis buﬀer for others, as described below.
I’ll email the list if it doesn’t work, otherwise you can
assume it is a ﬁne method.
HeatherHi, here is the email for the scientist who invented the
FTA card: Leigh.Burgoyne@ﬂinders.edu.au I have used
them myself for cuttleﬁsh tissue and they work ﬁne. I
think with blood its even better. I am sure Leigh would
answer all your questions better than I can, so contact
him.
Hello Heather. I haven’t used the FTA cards, but what
I do use is simple Whatman ﬁlter paper. I just soak up
the blood with strips of ﬁlter paper, stick them in a tube
of EtOH, and store them at room temperature. I have
successfully amped both microsatellites and mtDNA
genes using this procedure (all birds). Considering you
will be taking fresh blood (i.e. lots of good DNA),
you can use a digestion followed by a simple phenol-
chloroform extraction. This is the cheapest way I know
of (though tedious) and gives good DNA preps. If
money is not an issue, you can use kits such as QIA-
GEN DNEasy - this is the cleaner approach, but costs
a lot more. If I had the funding then this is the way
that I would go - faster, cleaner, and avoid the nasty
phenol-chloroform fumes (phenol is a carcinogen).
OR Just take a scalpel and cut a square ~5 mm x 5 mm
from the ﬁlter paper, digest in lysis buﬀer with Pro K
in a waterbath (55-65 degrees) overnight, and perform
a phenol-chloroform extraction the next day. It’s that
simple. Hope this helps.
I’d collect blood in lysis buﬀer unless there is some
serious reason not too. Presumably you need needles
to make a prick with the FTA card method and maybe
also capillaries to transfer the blood to the card. That’s
all you need to collect blood in lysis buﬀer in screw-cap
tubes and I would think you could get more blood into
the tube.
Second and more importantly, if you’re planning
mtDNA work, collect a feather or two in addition to the
blood sample. Nuclear copies are a potentially pesky
problem with blood samples and feathers generally pro-
vide clean mtDNA sequences in cases where blood sam-
ples produce a co-ampliﬁed product,

Formaldehyde ﬁxed samples
Dear all,
I have ﬁve very valuable samples of voles (Rodentia)
from Romania, that were originally stored in formalde-
hyde and after a year or two transferred to alcohol.
Most methods that deal with DNA extraction from such
a material state that the suﬃciency is only about 20%
of all samples and none of them succeeded in a PCR
product from my samples. Does anyone have a pro-
tocol that gives any better results? Is a 300bp PCR
product too long to believe in? I’ll be grateful for all
the replies.

GelCompar AFLPs
Hi
we are trying out the GelCompare software to analyse
AFLP banding patterns in plants. The software seems
to be quite useful, but we are not sure about the best
settings for AFLP’s. Does anyone has any experience
with GelCompar and AFLP’s especially on sensible sen-
sitivity settings, i.e. on the best value for “minimum
proﬁling” and the percentage “optimisation”?

Marker choice
EvolDir,
Can anyone actually justify spending time, eﬀort and
money on randomly generated molecular markers (e.g.
AFLPs and RAPDs/ISSRs) for ecological studies that
assume (hope) markers are selectively neutral? Has
anyone attempted to correlate any of these randomly
generated markers with ecological variables?
Any thoughts would be of interest.

Micro checker
Dear Evol. Dir. members,
Regarding Tom’s email on the scoring of microsatel-
lites, and in particular possible genotyping errors due
to stuttering, large allele drop out and null alleles, we
have designed software that can help you identify such
scoring errors.24 EvolDir August 1, 2003
The software is free and can be downloaded from:
http://www.microchecker.hull.ac.uk/ The software,
called MICRO-CHECKER, is a Windows-based (Win-
dows 98 SE, 2000 and XP, not yet tested on NT or ME),
and can test the genotyping of microsatellite data from
diploid populations. The program aids the identiﬁca-
tion of various genotyping errors, and can also detect
typographic errors. MICRO-CHECKER estimates the
frequency of null alleles at a locus using a series of algo-
rithms. If null alleles are detected, MICRO-CHECKER
can also adjust allele and genotype frequencies of the
ampliﬁed alleles, which allows the data to be used in
further population genetic analysis, for instance with
GenePop, Arlequin or Fstat.

Micro sizes
Hello:
Can anyone give me advice on scoring microsatellite
fragment sizes? I’m running m13 tailed di- and tri-
nucleotide repeats on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer.
We are getting nice clean runs but are seeing quite a
bit of stutter for large repeat fragments. Between the
stutter and poly-a addition, I’m worried about the ac-
curacy of calling the actual fragment size for the large
repeats. Are there any tricks to reduce stutter?

Pop Foundings
Hi, I could use suggestions on the best way to answer
a particular question using microsats. Say you have
two remnant populations of a species. One of them is
smaller and is much less diverse than the other. I would
like to distinguish between two scenarios for the origin
of those two populations. (1) The large population was
the only surviving remnant of the original species, and
then the less diverse population was recently founded
by individuals from the larger population, or (2) each
population is an independent remant from the origi-
nally widely distributed species. At two out of 11 loci
the small population has private alleles (i.e. not seen
in my sample from the large population). This argues
for the latter scenario. However, this is just a verbal
argument. It is possible that the two populations were
part of a common gene pool and the larger population
just lost those alleles owing to drift since the two rem-
nant populations were isolated (or the alleles are rare
and weren’t seen owing to inadequate sampling of the
large population). I would like to estimate a relative
likelihood for the two scenarios. If the two populations
were historically diﬀerentiationed to a large extent then
Rst should be greater than Fst (I haven’t checked yet).
Any other suggestions on ways to distinguish between
the two scenarios? Thanks, Mike

OLOGY
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation is pleased to invite
nominations for Sloan Research Fellowships in Com-
putational and Evolutionary Biology.
The Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded each year
to a select number of scientists in the early stages of
their careers, usually in their ﬁrst appointment to uni-
versity faculties. Since the program was initiated in
1955 in only three scientiﬁc ﬁelds, some 28 former Sloan
Research Fellows have won Nobel Prizes, and hundreds
have received other honors.The deadline for receipt of nominations is September
15, 2003. Candidates must be members of the regu-
lar faculty (i.e. tenure track) of a college or university
in appointments in United States or Canada, and be
nominated by a senior scientist. Direct applications are
not accepted. The eligibility criteria are quite speciﬁc,
and are described in appropriate detail in the enclosed
brochure, and at www.sloan.org under “Fellowships.”
I invite you to consider nominating any outstanding
young scientists who meet the eligibility criteria.

Software Structure 2 1
We have now released the newest version of the soft-
ware package Structure (version 2.1) for analyzing ge-
netic population structure. The new version includes
some updates to the basic algorithm, as well as a user-
friendly graphical front-end.
The software can be downloaded from http://-
pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu (click on “software”).
Structure is designed for studying population structure
using multilocus genotype data from each of a sam-
ple of individuals. The program implements a model-
based clustering method for identifying the presence of
distinct populations represented in the sample. Indi-
viduals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to
populations, or jointly to two or more populations if
their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Ap-
plications include detecting the presence of population
structure, assigning individuals to populations, study-
ing hybrid zones, identifying migrants and admixed in-
dividuals, and association mapping in the presence of
population structure.
Users may also be interested in the program ’distruct’
written by Noah Rosenberg for plotting Structure re-
sults (see Science 298:2381). Distruct is available at
www-hto.usc.edu/ ~noahr/diversity.html.
What’s new in this release? Version 2 (Beta) intro-
duced a user-friendly graphical interface that makes us-
ing Structure much easier, and provides various tools
for visualizing the MCMC output and results and or-
ganizing the output data.
Version 2 (Beta) also introduced some algorithmic ex-
tensions, including a new model that allows loci to be
linked (though still not tightly linked). Among other
changes, it also improved the model of correlated al-
lele frequencies, often leading to better performance on
problems with weak population structure. The details
are in a paper by Falush, Stephens and Pritchard (Ge-
netics, in Press; available from the Structure website).
Version 2.1 corrects some minor bugs in the Beta release
(see web page), and adds a few small features.
Contributors to the Structure project include Peter
Donnelly, Daniel Falush, Matthew Stephens, William
Wen and myself.

tar production lines. However, for the low line contrary
to expectation nectar production increased rather than
decreased. To control for this shift in nectar produc-

Dear colleague
Please ﬁnd below the oﬀer for a postdoctorate posi-
tion at INRA Dijon, France, on Crop/Weed gene ﬂow.
Thank you very much.
POSTDOCTORATE POSITION IN CROP/WEED
GENE FLOW
We are currently looking for a postdoctorate candidate
to be involved in our ongoing research project on the
assessment of gene ﬂow between a cereal, the foxtail
millet, and its wild relative, the green foxtail. This
project is the continuation of a European contract and
has French-Chinese funding, and the one-year postdoc-
torate position is funded by the Council of the Bur-
gundy Region. It is part of the activity of our team
working on herbicide resistance in weed and gene ﬂow
between transgenic crops and wild relatives.
Genetic resources were used to breed for herbicide resis-
tant millet. Since green foxtail, the putative ancestor,
is distributed in the same areas, there is a risk of spread
of the resistance trait from the crop to the weed, which
could jeopardize the beneﬁts. The question is similar
to that raised with transgenic crops and their impact
on the genetic structure and diversity of populations
of wild relatives. Contrary to maize, oilseed rape and
beet that have outcrossing (and even self-incompatible)
wild relatives, the originality and interest of millet is
that both the crop and the wild relative are mainly
autogamous. However, evidence of gene ﬂow has been
already provided. We investigate the speed of gene dis-
persal in three cases: a cytoplasmic inherited, a nuclear
dominant, and a nuclear recessive resistance. Point mu-
tations have been described (the last one in press) and
PCR allelic tests allow recognizing hetero and homozy-
gous plants. Sampling of the weed within and around
experimental resistant millet ﬁelds in France and China
provides the material to check resistance alleles fre-
quency evolution under diﬀerent selection pressures. At
the same time, neutral marker genes and domestication
alleles ﬂow toward the weed and oﬀer the way to studythe impact of gene ﬂow onto the genetic structure of
populations. Study and link to past introgression could
be approached using the genetic resources. Recent ref-
erences of our group on that topic are listed below.
We are primarily looking for a candidate with labora-
tory expertise in molecular biology applied to popula-
tion genetics tools and evolutionary biology. The posi-
tion is available now and must start before the end of
December 2003. The candidate must have obtained a
PhD within 5 years (no more) and never get a salary in
France. The grant is 1850 per month (the same as for
a young scientist) oﬀered for 1 year (with little chance
of extending to a second year). Language is not a prob-
lem at the laboratory. The INRA Institute is located
on the University campus (30000 students) in the city
of Dijon, the capital of Burgundy wine...

ICAPBEdinburgh Speciation
Postdoctoral research position: Theoretical analysis of
speciation
The aim of this project is to develop a general theoret-
ical framework for modelling the origin of new species.
This will be based on a new technique for analysing the
evolution of multiple genetic loci, which leads to sim-
ple approximations. Particular attention will be paid
to the genetic basis of reproductive isolation; the re-
lation between parapatric and sympatric models; and
understanding how divergence is maintained in mosaic
hybrid zones.
The PDRA would develop population genetic models of
speciation, using computer simulation and the symbolic
algebra package Mathematica. The successful candi-
date would either be a biologist with strong quantita-
tive skills, or someone with a background in mathemat-
ics/physics/statistics who is keen to work in evolution-
ary genetics. Previous experience with computer simu-
lation/numerical methods, together with some mathe-
matical ability, are required.
The project is a collaboration between Nick Barton and
Mark Kirkpatrick (Univ. of Texas at Austin). It is
funded by the Natural Environment Research Council
for three years; the starting salary is £22,191 p.a. The
postdoc would be based at Edinburgh, but would in-
volve short visits to work in Austin.
The Institute of Cell, Animal and Population Biol-
ogy at the University of Edinbuirgh has an excep-
tionally strong group of evolutionary geneticists. De-
tails of ICAPB research can be found at http://-
www.icapb.ed.ac.uk . , and the multilocus software is
athttp://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/evolgen/ . To ﬁnd out
more, contact n.barton@ed.ac.uk. To apply for the
post, please email a CV, together with the names of
at least two referees, and a brief statement of your re-
search interests. The closing date is August 15th 2003,
with a starting date as early as possible.

tory to pursue a variety of potential studies in rock-
ﬁsh of the North Paciﬁc. Proposals will be considered
that address one or more issues related to the genetics,
demographics, life history, and ecology of this highly
speciose and evolutionarily interesting group. The Se-
bastes rockﬁsh complex of the North Paciﬁc has been
compared to the East African cichlid species ﬂockas
a laboratory for the study of speciation and ecologi-
cal diversiﬁcation. Research opportunities range fromhigher-order systematics and evolutionary history to
ﬁne scale population structure relevant to, for example,
Marine Protected Areas. Of particular interest will be
proposals that target species of conservation concern
(or appropriate surrogates) and provide a combination
of basic descriptive information as well as exploration
of more general biological phenomena. Were looking for
creative applications using varied molecular techniques,
diﬀerent scales of temporal divergence, and various eco-
logical life-history classes (e.g., sedentary to pelagic).

NOAA/NRC POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSO-
CIATESHIP PROGRAM 2003 at the Northwest Fish-
eries Science Center, Seattle, WA 98112
Two Post Doctoral Fellowships at the Northwest Fish-
eries Science Center are oﬀered on the several possible
topics related to Paciﬁc salmonids population biology
and its relationships to habitat, hatchery and harvest
impacts.
We are oﬀering two postdoctoral research fellowships
at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NMFS) in
Seattle. A primary focus of research at the Science
Center is the conservation and recovery of wild popu-
lations of anadromous Paciﬁc salmonids. The postdoc-
toral fellows will have the opportunity to interact with
over 200 scientists from several Divisions at the North-
west Fisheries Science Center. Research interests in-
clude general ﬁsh ecology, physiology, population biol-
ogy, interactions between wild and hatchery ﬁsh, ocean
and estuarine ecology, and evolutionary biology. More
details about speciﬁc research foci at the Center and
potential collaborators for this project can be found at
the NWFSCs web site ( http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/ )
and through contacts below.
The postdoctoral positions are part of the National Re-
search Council Research Associateship program; salary
is $42,000 U.S. per year. Requirements: you must have
received a PhD, ScD, or MD degree (or foreign equiv-
alent) within the last ﬁve years, or you must be able
to present evidence of having completed all formal re-
quirements for the degree before tenure begins. U.S.
citizenship is not required. Deadlines for postdoctoral
applications is August 1 (email or postmark date) or
November 1. Awards will be announced in September
or October 2003 for the August deadline and in Jan-
uary 2004 for the November deadline, and tenure could
begin soon thereafter.
As described below, we have identiﬁed two general areas
of emphasis for the two postdoctoral research positions
and expect that the successful candidates will work in
one of these areas:
1. The eﬀects of the characteristics of freshwa-
ter/estuarine habitat, hatchery management and har-
vest eﬀects on salmon population dynamics and pro-ductivity.
Successful recovery of listed Paciﬁc salmon in the Pa-
ciﬁc Northwest will depend in part on our ability to
quantify the relative eﬀects of diﬀerent habitat, hatch-
ery and harvest management changes on salmon popu-
lations. Population dynamic models that can integrate
the eﬀects of diﬀerent management actions on salmonid
population status are in their infancy. We are seek-
ing candidates with quantitative skills who can further
develop population models to relate eﬀects of habitat,
hatchery and harvest on salmon populations across the
Paciﬁc Northwest. Modeling approaches that take ad-
vantage of life-stage-speciﬁc data are encouraged.
2. Eﬀects of climate change on Paciﬁc salmonids.
Climate eﬀects on populations occur on time scales
from years to decades to global climate change. Ret-
rospective analyses help us understand past anthro-
pogenic impacts on anadromous ﬁsh species. Forecasts
can help us understand rates of recovery of threatened
salmonids. We are seeking a postdoctoral candidate
who can propose novel approaches to investigation of
climate impacts on the terrestrial and marine envi-
ronments associated with anadromous salmonid species
along the U. S. West coast.

toral positions, contact Mary Ruckelshaus

StanfordU MaizeDuplicatedGenes
Postdoctoral position: evolutionary and functional
analysis of duplicated genes in maize
The maize genome is the result of a fairly recent poly-
ploidization event ( ~20 MYA) that left behind a very
large number of duplicated genes. Many of these
duplicated genes are functional, and initial analysis
has shown that many duplicates have evolved non-
redundant regions of expression. Maize provides a
nearly perfect system to answer the key evolutionary
questions about the fates of duplicated genes. The
genome duplication is recent enough that the data
are not hopelessly saturated with multiple hits, yet
old enough that there is enough information to carry
out most evolutionary analyses. The recently ﬁnished
genome sequence of Rice provides a convenient out-August 1, 2003 EvolDir 37
group.
The project builds on the success of the maize gene dis-
covery project ( http://www.zmdb.iastate.edu ) spear-
headed by the PI Virginia Walbot. The project has
generated a large number of EST sequences from dif-
ferent tissues and strains of maize. These sequences
are being used to generate oligo microarrays to investi-
gate gene expression of genes throughout maize devel-
opment. The design of the oligo arrays will allow the
measurement of duplicate-speciﬁc gene expression for
even very similar duplicated genes.
The current project is a collaboration between the PI
Virginia Walbot (maize genetics and molecular biology)
and co-PI Dmitri Petrov (molecular evolution) (both at
Stanford). Volker Brendel (bioinformatics) at the Iowa
State University is a collaborator on the project. The
position is advertised in anticipation of funding from
the NSF.
We are looking speciﬁcally for a molecular evolutionary
biologist or a population geneticist with strong quanti-
tative skills. The postdoctoral fellow will be based at
Stanford University and will interact closely with both
Dmitri Petrov and Virginia Walbot. The project will
involve annual trips to Iowa State University to consult
with Volker Brendel who will be maintaining the main
databases.
For additional information please e-mail Dmitri Petrov
(dpetrov@stanford.edu). To apply please email a CV,
together with the names of at least two referees, and
a brief statement of your research interests and accom-
plishments. The position will be opened until ﬁlled.

ULaval SalmonidGenomics
POSTDOCTORATE POSITION IN SALMONID
EVOLUTIONARY FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS
We are currently looking for a postdoctorate candidate
to be involved in our ongoing research project on the
elucidation of genetic and ecological processes of adap-
tive radiation. This multidisciplinary project is funded
by NSERC (Canada) and part of the research program
of the Chair in conservation genetics of aquatic organ-
isms.
The originality and interest of this project is based upon
a multidisciplinary approach integrating genomics, sys-
tematics and ecology. The use of coregonine ﬁshes
(salmonidae) as a model system also oﬀers particular
interest for investigating the interactions of evolution-
ary forces in shaping population divergence and repro-
ductive isolation. Namely,
the whiteﬁsh species complex is characterized by the
occurrence of sympatric forms that are highly diﬀeren-
tiated in life history traits, metabolism, morphological
and ecological characteristics. Yet these populations
remains partially reproductiveley isolated despite po-
tential for gene ﬂow.
The speciﬁc objective of the proposed research will be
to apply microarray
technology for quantifying gene expression proﬁles be-
tween dwarf and normal whiteﬁsh ecotypes. The gen-
eral hypothesis to be tested is that these forms exhibit
adaptive diﬀerential gene expression patterns that have
been shaped by natural selection. A 4000 gene microar-
ray developped in
salmonids is already available to achieve this work.
We are primarily looking for a candidate with strong
laboratory expertise in functional genomics, a solid the-
oretical background in evolutionary biology, as well as
expertise in management and analysis of large data
bases. The position is available now and will be oﬀered
for 2 years with apossibility of extending to a third year.

The Felsenstein/Kuhner Lab is seeking a Senior Fellow
to work with Mary Kuhner on development of algo-
rithms to estimate evolutionary parameters from molec-
ular sequence data. This position is funded by the NIH
for two years with the option of a third year.
Our approach involves Markov Chain Monte Carlo sam-
pling of genealogies, a computer-intensive approach
that attempts to take into account our inability to be
certain about the genealogy of a population. Our lab’s
central goal is to develop, test, and distribute computer
programs in the LAMARC package so that these meth-
ods will become available to biologists.
The successful applicant will work on one or more of
our three current areas of interest: * Estimation of se-
lection coeﬃcients * Estimation of recombination rate
and detection of recombination hotspots * Mapping of
trait loci via linkage disequilibrium patterns
We are looking for someone who can take up one of
our subprojects and pursue it, managing both design
and coding, though with ample support and collabo-
ration from the group as a whole. The applicant will
be expected to help design as well as implement new
algorithms.
This is a small, tight-knit working group with good
computer support resources. The University of Wash-
ington is developing interdisciplinary strengths in com-
putational biology and this is an exciting time to work
here. Our lab’s previous work can be found at: http:/-
/evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc.html Applicants
should hold a Ph.D. in biology, computer science, or
statistics. Statistical experience is needed; phyloge-
netics or population genetics will be particularly help-
ful. C++ programming experience is preferred, al-

CORAL REEF GENOMICS
Global warming has impacted coral reefs worldwide by
causing the disruption of coral-zooxanthella symbioses
(coral bleaching), causing many corals to subsequently
die. This project aims to gain a better understanding of
the molecular and cellular interactions that are critical
to the functional integrity of these symbioses. This is an
interdisciplinary project that will integrate ecology and
genome biology to study gene expression in a tropical
marine reef ecosystem. Research will be conducted in
the Florida Keys and at the Joint Genome Institute in
Walnut Creek (JGI), California, starting on September
1st 2003. A postdoctoral scientist position is available
to study the molecular mechanisms involved in coral-
zooxanthellae symbiotic interactions by using genomic
approaches.
The primary responsibilities of this position will be to
develop EST data from the coral host and the algal
symbiont, and participate in microarray development
and expression proﬁle analyses. There will be possibili-
ties to interact with a wide array of genome scientists at
the JGI as well as with coral reef biologists in the ﬁeld.
Applicants should have a relevant Ph.D. and experience
in functional genomics. Experience with management
and analysis of microarray datasets, symbiotic systems
and/or coral reef biology would be desired. The posi-
tion will be oﬀered for one year with the possibility of
extension.
The JGI, established on January 1, 1997, is a con-
sortium of scientists, engineers and support staﬀ from
the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley,
Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Labo-
ratories. The Evolutionary Genomics Department is

NSF funded post-doctoral position for up to three years
is available in the laboratory of Gunter Wagner at Yale
University
Starting date: ASAP
Area of research: molecular evolution of duplicated Hox
genes
Summary: This research is part of a collaborative ef-
fort to understand the role of developmental gene du-
plication in the evolution of chordates. The partici-
pating labs are that of Dr Frank Ruddle at Yale’s De-
partment of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biol-
ogy (responsible for the mammalian transgenic work),
Dr Chris Amemiya from the Virginia Mason Research
Institute in Seattle, WA (responsible for the zebraﬁsh
transgenic work and genomic analysis) and the Wagner
lab at Yale’s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology (responsible for molecular evolution). The goal
of this continuing project is to understand the role that
Hox cluster duplications have played in the evolution
of the vertebrate body plan. The most recent Hox clus-
ter duplication happened in the ray ﬁnned ﬁsh lineage,
leading to the seven Hox clusters found in zebraﬁsh,
and other teleosts. Surprisingly Hox clusters duplica-
tions do not seem to have played a prominent role in
the evolution of other metazoan phyla.The speciﬁc objectives of the research in the Wagner lab
during the current funding cycle are: 1) to determine
exactly when in ray ﬁnned ﬁsh phylogeny the most re-
cent Hox cluster duplication happened. 2) Determine
what the evolutionary forces were that acted on Hox
genes after duplication, both at the coding as well as
the cis-regulatory sequences. The latter objective will
closely interact with the experimental work determin-
ing the functional diﬀerences between teleost genes and
their unduplicated outgroups done in the Ruddle and
Amemiya labs. 3) Isolate and analyze the Hox clusters
of the basal ray ﬁnned paddleﬁsh, Polyodon spathula.
This part of the project will establish an appropriate
out- group model species for the analysis of teleost gene
function.
Required skills and expectations: Skill in standard
molecular techniques is required (cloning, PCR, se-
quencing and sequence assembly), as is familiarity
with the standard molecular evolution analysis tech-
niques such as sequence alignment, phylogenetic anal-
ysis, analysis of rates and patterns of sequence evolu-
tion. The post-doctoral researcher is expected to in-
tegrate into a highly interactive and diverse group of
researchers. The Wagner lab consists of geneticists, pa-
leontologists and theorists working on various aspects of
the developmental evolution of vertebrates. See http:/-

Beyond BLAST and FASTA - This course presents
a comprehensive overview of the theory and practice
of computational methods for gene identiﬁcation and
characterization from DNA sequence data. The course
focuses on approaches for extracting the maximum
amount of information from protein and DNA sequence
similarity through sequence database searches, statisti-
cal analysis, and multiple sequence alignment. Addi-
tional topics include gene recognition (exon/intron pre-
diction), identifying signals in unaligned sequences, and
integration of genetic and sequence information in bio-
logical databases. The course combines lectures with
hands-on exercises; students are encouraged to pose
challenging sequence analysis problems using their own
data. The course makes extensive use of local WWW
pages to present problem sets and the computing tools
to solve them. Students use Windows and Mac work-
stations attached to a UNIX server; participants should
be comfortable using the Unix operating system and a
Unix text editor.The course is designed for biologists seeking advanced
training in biological sequence analysis, computational
biology core resource directors and staﬀ, and for scien-
tists in other disciplines, such as computer science, who
wish to survey current research problems in biological
sequence analysis.
The primary focus of the Computational Genomics
Course is the theory and practice of algorithms used
in computational biology, with the goal of using cur-
rent methods more eﬀectively and developing new al-
gorithms. Students more interested in the practical as-
pects of software development are encouraged to ap-
ply to the Cold Spring Harbor Bioinformatics - Writing

The increasing availability of complete genomes from
diverse organisms oﬀers unprecedented opportunities.
Exploitation of the full power intergenomic compara-
tive maps for all types of genomic events will be cen-
tral in biological, medical and bioinformatics research
in the post-genomic era. Several areas are crucial to the
success of this enterprise, for instance: understanding
patterns and processes of genome evolutionary change,
mapping genomic mutational events, and the utiliza-
tion of such maps as bioinformatics tools. Genomic
data also facilitates phylogeny reconstruction based on
genomic mutational events rather than nucleotide sub-
stitution.
The kernel of comparative genome analysis is the es-
tablishment of the correspondence (orthology analysis)
between genes in diﬀerent genomes. It is such interge-
nomic maps that make it possible to translate informa-
tion from one organism to another. Genome evolution
is shaped by a multitude of evolutionary events act-
ing at various organizational levels. On a low level
point mutations aﬀect individual nucleotides. On a
higher level genome segments are aﬀected by processes
such as duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, trans-
position, deletion and insertion. Finally, the whole
genome is inﬂuenced by speciation and hybridization
of organism lineages. The complexity of genome evo-
lution poses a serious challenge in developing mathe-
matical models and algorithms. Fortunately, there is a
spectra of algorithmic techniques that can be applied to
problems from this domain, ranging from exact, heuris-
tic, ﬁxed parameter and approximation algorithms for
problems based on parsimony models to Monte Carlo
Markov Chain algorithms for Bayesian analysis of prob-
lems based on probabilistic models.

Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a

To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.48 EvolDir August 1, 2003
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
