CONFERENCE ON THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLU-
TION OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS
A two-day conference on the Ecology and Evolution of
Plant-Pollinator Interactions will be held on August 2-
3, 2008, immediately prior to the Ecological Society of
America Meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.
The goal of this conference is to highlight the most ex-
citing recent advances in community and evolutionary
pollination biology, and foster interaction among polli-
nation biologists. We aim to encourage a uniﬁed frame-
work to the study of community and evolutionary ap-
proaches, and to draw attention to largely unexplored
questions at the intersection of these disciplines. This
two-day conference will feature 23 speakers from ﬁve
continents, as well as a poster session.
Conference speakers and topics have been selected to
complement, rather than repeat, the major themes
covered at the 2007 International Pollinator Sympo-
sium. The 30 minute symposium presentations will
be scheduled throughout the day on Saturday, August
2 and Sunday, August 3. To promote interaction be-
tween symposium speakers and participants, there are
planned breaks with time for discussion as well as a
two-hour poster session and reception on the evening
of Saturday, August 2. The poster session will provide
an outstanding opportunity for pollination ecologists at
all levels to share ideas. We encourage all conference
attendees to present a poster. Note that individuals
presenting a talk or poster in this Pollination Confer-
ence are also welcome to present a contributed paper or
poster (even the same poster) at the Ecological Society
of America meeting.
REGISTRATION: Individuals planning to attend the
Pollination Conference must register online at the ESA
website: http://www.esa.org/milwaukee/ Registration
will open in early April, 2008 and must be completed
by June 2, 2008. There are two registration options:
a) If you plan to attend BOTH the Pollination Confer-
ence and the Main ESA meeting, you should pay the
ESA annual meeting fee (approx. $ 140 for student
members; $ 285 for regular members) PLUS the Polli-4 EvolDir January 1, 2008
nation Conference fee of $ 50.
b) If you plan to attend the Pollination Conference, but
will NOT be attending the Main ESA meeting, you
should pay the “ESA one-event registration fee” of $
45 PLUS the Pollination Conference Fee of $ 50. Note
that the total cost of registration for this option would
be $95.
POSTER PRESENTATION: All participants in the
Pollination Conference are encouraged to present
posters. Poster titles should be submitted to Jeﬀ Kar-
ron by June 2, 2008 at: karron@uwm.edu. In the sub-
ject line of the email, list “pollination ecology poster”.
Due to space limitations, we will only be able to accom-
modate 150 posters. Titles will be accepted on a ﬁrst-
come ﬁrst-served basis. Note that poster presenters do
not register their posters for the Pollination Conference
on the ESA website; they can only do so by emailing
Jeﬀ Karron.
POSTER DIMENSIONS: Poster boards are approxi-
mately 2.4 m wide x 1.2 m tall (8 x 4 feet). Please
design your poster to be at least 5 cm (2 inch) smaller
on each margin.
HOUSING: ESA has reserved a limited number of ho-
tel rooms and dorm rooms for Friday and Saturday
evenings. See the ESA housing link for more informa-
tion.
ESA MEETINGS: We encourage participants to stay
throughout the week and attend the ESA annual meet-
ing (August 3-8) that follows the Pollination Confer-
ence. Participants in the Pollination Conference can
present a talk and/or poster at the ESA meeting as
well. Titles of talks and posters for the ESA meeting
should be submitted online between December 17, 2007
and February 28, 2008. The link for the ESA meeting
page is: http://www.esa.org/milwaukee/ CONTACT:

Workshop: Analogies in the evolution of gender expres-
sion and sexual strategies in plants and animals (Ger-
many, 2008) September 10-14, 2008 (including arrival
and departure days)
*Application deadline: January 31st, 2008*
Current research on the evolution of reproductive
strategies and gender expression still tends to proceed
almost independently between botanists and zoologists.
Yet, the evolutionary processes involved are often com-
plementary, indicating that linkage of ideas between
both ﬁelds would be highly beneﬁcial. This cross-
disciplinary workshop therefore addresses the analo-
gies in reproductive evolution between plants and ani-
mals (with a focus on hermaphrodite mating systems).
The meeting brings together empiricists and theoreti-
cians from both disciplines. Major topics to be cov-
ered include phylogenetic patterns of gender expres-
sion and their transitions, the role of mate competi-
tion in shaping sexual strategies, and the role of self-
ing/outcrossing/mixed mating systems.
*Application In your e-mail application, please provide
the following information:
1. Full aﬃliation and contact details:
2. Preliminary title for your workshop contribution,
as well as the preferred type of presentation (oral or
poster):
3. In order to facilitate the potentially necessary selec-
tion of participants, please also outline the topics to be
addressed in your contribution in a 2-3 sentence state-
ment:4. Would you require partial travel refund: Yes/No (If
yes, your expected total travel costs: )
*Venue Sparkassen-Akademie Neuhausen (Germany), a
conference hotel easily reached from Stuttgart Interna-
tional Airport. Accommodation is on site.
*Meeting style Workshop with max. 60 participants, fa-
cilitating discussion of current research highlights, joint
project applications and future research collaborations.
*Funding The workshop is generously supported by the
Volkswagen foundation, enabling us to oﬀer free bed &
breakfast, no conference fees and an option for partial
travel refunds.
*Costs Local costs to be covered by all attendants in-
clude meals (lunch, dinner) and beverages.
*Type of contributions The number of oral contri-
butions is restricted to 30. Oral presentations must
meet the scope of the workshop by presenting broader
perspectives relevant to the evolution of reproductive
strategies in plants and/or animals. Poster presenta-
tions are possible, as is participation in the meeting
without any formal contribution.
We are looking forward to receiving your application
emails.

for presentations in a symposium “Contributions of ge-
netic principles and technology to sustainable ﬁsheries:
concepts, challenges, and case studies”, to be held at
138th Annual Meeting of the American Fisheries So-
ciety in Ottawa, Canada, August 17-21, 2008. Sym-posium proposals must be submitted by January 11,
2008. Presenters’ abstracts will be due February 29,
2008. Accordingly, we would like to receive the names
and tentative titles of speakers who would be interested
in contributing to this symposium by January 8, 2008.
For further information regarding the symposium and
contacts for submission of titles, please contact sympo-
sium conveners Chris Wilson ( Chris.Wilson@nrdpfc.ca )
or Kim Scribner (scribne3@msu.edu).
Symposium outline: Populations of most ﬁsh species
are increasingly impacted by stressors that alter demo-
graphic characteristics, distribution, and the features
of the environments they inhabit and have adapted to.
Genetic theory and technology have become essential
components of management programs to understand
and overcome stressors that threaten sustainable ﬁsh-
eries. This symposium will develop several conceptual
issues for ﬁsheries professionals from a genetics perspec-
tive that aﬀect the long-term viability of ﬁsh popula-
tions. Sections will focus on policy issues, concepts and
theory, and empirical data in each of several topical
areas. Subject areas will include (1) population de-
lineation and distinctiveness of populations and iden-
tiﬁcation of distinct population segments for manage-
ment and conservation planning, (2) means of quan-
tifying population-speciﬁc levels of exploitation based
on estimates of contributions of multiple source popu-
lations to mixed-stock and inter-jurisdictional ﬁsheries,
(3) response of ﬁsheries to anthropogenic and abiotic
stressors such as climate change, (4) consequences of
the loss of adaptive variation in heritable phenotypic,
behavioral, and physiological traits due to environmen-
tal change and to exploitation, and (5) sustainability of
populations when natural recruitment is supplemented
by stocking. Presentations will present conceptual and
empirical analyses highlighting the comparative ﬁtness
of wild, stocked, and introgressed ﬁsh, potential detri-
mental eﬀects of inbreeding and outbreeding depres-
sion, and (6) empirical applications of molecular ge-
netic data to elucidate aspects of species behavior, re-
productive success, and general ecology. Topics will
also help inform restoration and rehabilitation eﬀorts
for depressed ﬁsheries.

We are pleased to announce the Adelaide Conference
on Mathematical Evolutionary Biology, the ﬁrst of an
annual series that will take place within Blanche Cave,
Naracoorte Caves, South Australia. This 5 day meet-
ing is designed to bring together mathematicians and
biologists from around Australia and internationally, in
an informal collaborative atmosphere limited to just 50
seats. The meeting is closely modelled on the very
successful New Zealand Phylogenetics meeting series,
which has resulted in the development of a very strong
biomathematics community in New Zealand. Four of
the leading members of the New Zealand group will
help lead and direct the Naracoorte meeting, facilitat-
ing communication between these ﬁelds which currently
have little interaction within Australia.
The organisers cordially invite to you to attend this
conference and registration is now open. Students are
encouraged to attend and please get your registration in
early to guarantee a seat due to the very limited space.
Important Notes Registration deadline: by no later
than March 3rd, 2008. Accommodation: a few local
hotel/motels have been earmarked especially for this
conference, oﬀering negotiated discount rates. Refer to
the conference website for details. Please ensure you
book accommodation early to safeguard a place to stay
at Naracoorte. Conference updates: Our website will
be the main source of information with email traﬃc
kept to a minimum. Web updates will be posted reg-
ularly at <http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/events/

This is an early announcement of the:- ECOLOGI-CAL GENETICS GROUP MEETING 2008 In 2008
the Ecological Genetics Group (EGG) will be holding
its 52nd annual meeting which will be at the Univer-
sity of Sheﬃeld, England, between the 1st-3rd April.
EGG is an informal group of scientists; academics, re-
searchers and graduate students, whose interests in-
clude the genetics of evolution and ecology, popula-
tion genetics & biology, biogeography and evolution-
ary adaptation, biosystematics, conservation, molecu-
lar ecology and phylogeography. For further informa-
tion go to:- http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/-

The invited speaker in 2008 is Professor Loren Reise-
berg from the USA, who has received awards for his pi-
oneering research into the evolution of new species and
use of a wide range of theoretical and experimental ap-
proaches from classical cross-breeding to genomic map-
ping. Current work includes the evolutionary forces
underlying phenotypic diversiﬁcation. As at all EGG
meetings, there will be an afternoon ﬁeld visit to a lo-
cal site of ecological and conservation interest. In 2008
this will be to Cressbrookdale, part of the Derbyshire
Dales National Nature Reserve, to see the early ﬂower-
ing species and talk about management of the site.

CarletonU Evolution of Sex
Graduate Positions - Evolution of Sex
Carleton University, Department of Biology
Root Gorelick seeks new graduate students (primar-
ily PhD, but also MSc) to study the evolutionary ori-
gin of eukaryotic sex. We are focusing on organ-
isms that only have sex with themselves, e.g. pedes-
trian self-fertilisation, complete automixis, and restitu-
tional automixis. This work is largely theoretical, but
not exclusively so as we are also planning to conduct
MSAP (methylation-sensitive ampliﬁcation polymor-
phism). Students interested in the social or philosoph-
ical question of whether self-sex counts as sex should
also contact me.
Interested students should send a cv, summary of
research experience and interests, contact details
of two referees, approximate GPA, and informa-
tion on whether you are a Canadian citizen or
permanent resident. See Carleton University’s
Biology website for information on the gradu-
ate program ( www.carleton.ca/biology/prospect/-

ClemsonU EvoDevo
Graduate Opportunities in Evolutionary Developmen-
tal Biology at Clemson UniversityGraduate Assistantships (M.Sc., $15,000 or Ph.D.,
$18,000 for 12 months) are available in the labs of Drs.
Susan Chapman and Brad Hersh at Clemson Univer-
sity in the areas of evolutionary developmental biology.
Prospective candidates should have strong academic
records and some research experience in laboratory
bench work is preferred. Motivation, self-discipline, cre-
ativity, and good interpersonal skills are essential.
Chapman and her students want to understand the
molecular mechanisms required for middle ear induc-
tion and patterning. Avians have a primary jaw ar-
ticulation, while mammals have a secondary jaw artic-
ulation that has given rise to the incus and malleus,
which together with the stapes form the three ossicles
of the middle ear. The single columella in birds is the
functional equivalent of the three mammalian ossicles,
but developmental equivalent of the stapes. We are fo-
cused on identifying the required molecular signals and
tissues from which they derive in birds, with the long
term goal of testing these in mammals for translational
human health beneﬁts. ( http://www.clemson.edu/-
biosci/faculty/chapman/index.htm )
Hersh and his students study the development and
evolution of animal shapes, especially insect wings.
Current research focuses on two projects studying the
evolution and development of Drosophila: (1) The
regulation of gene expression in the Drosophila wing
and hindwing by the Hox protein Ultrabithorax; (2)
the identiﬁcation of genes involved in divergence of
male-speciﬁc morphologies within the melanogaster
subgroup. ( http://www.clemson.edu/biosci/faculty/-

Clemson University ( http://www.clemson.edu/ ) oﬀers
a stimulating environment and excellent resources for
cell and developmental biologists through the Biolog-
ical Sciences department ( http://www.clemson.edu/-

velop a dissertation project that relates to one of these
areas, using molecular and experimental techniques to
address ecological and evolutionary questions about
symbiosis.
Prior laboratory experience is required, and skills in
microscopy and standard techniques of molecular bi-
ology are preferred. Applicants should have a broad
biological background, with coursework in the ﬁelds of
molecular biology, genetics, ecology, and evolution.

ETH Zurich HostParasite
ETH Z¨ urich, Institute of Integrative Biology (IBZ)
The Experimental Ecology Group (Paul Schmid-
Hempel) is seeking to ﬁll a new
Ph.D. Position
(Genomics and diversity of host defences)
to work on questions of host-parasite interactions using
Bombus spp. and their parasites (protozoa, viruses,
bacteria) as the study system. The ecological frame-
work for this study is the relationship of host diversity
to the prevalence and diversity of pathogens in natural
populations of various Bombus species, with the goal
to eventually understand the co-evolutionary dynam-
ics of host-parasite interactions in general. Important
elements will be the genetics of immune defences and
the respective variation in natural populations. The
project will involve ﬁeld sampling and genetic typing
with molecular tools. We will integrate this advance
with existing and currently developed genomic data-
bases for B. terrestris to establish relationships and test
ideas. The biology and ecology of the species is well
known and it is readily accessible in the ﬁeld and in the
lab. In the project, the genomics approach will be inte-
grated into the ecology and evolution of populations to
test some major concepts of ecological theory and host-
parasite coevolution. Although the prime motivation
are questions of basic importance, the project is em-
bedded in a larger set of studies conducted at ETH ad-
dressing the signiﬁcance of ecological and genetic varia-
tion in natural systems with respect to disease, climatic
change and environmental degradation.
The ideal candidate is one who would like to work with
and be fascinated by both this combined approach and
the bumblebee system. They should have interests in
and see the possibilities at the crossroads of ecology,
genetics and evolution. An advantageous background
is in any of the relevant ﬁelds, such as evolutionary
ecology, population genetics or genomics / bioinformat-
ics. Salary and other conditions are in accordance withlocal regulations. The normal duration of a PhD at
ETH is 3 years. Special conditions for acceptance into
the PhD program of ETH may apply; a degree equiva-
lent to a M.Sc. is required. Preferred starting date is
spring 2008. Please send applications, with CV, names
of referees, and short statement of your interests in
this position to Prof. Paul Schmid- Hempel, prefer-
ably by email (psh@env.ethz.ch). Screening of applica-
tions will start 25 January 2008 or until post is ﬁlled.

SAfrica InvasiveSpeciesEvolution
Postgraduate Bursaries in Ecological Genetics of Inva-
sive Species Several opportunities at Honours, MSc and
PhD level at the Centre for Invasion Biology, Stellen-bosch University
Please note: these bursaries are only for South Africans
The C*I*B is a dynamic, internationally leading agency
which undertakes research to reduce the rate and im-
pacts of biological invasions. We are looking for several
postgraduate students interested in ecological genetics
and molecular ecology, to form part of a major 5 year
collaborative project with the Working for Water Pro-
gramme and the University of Adelaide / Herbarium of
South Australia.
Project details: The projects form part of a broader
project to improve our understanding and management
of alien plant invasions using molecular techniques.
Component 1 focuses on what is essentially a phylo-
geographic study of Australian plants invasive in South
Africa (more than 20 species of wattles and hakeas).
We want to understand how, why, and from where ex-
actly plants were introduced. This information is of
direct applied beneﬁt to classical biological control ef-
forts. But, by also comparing levels of genetic diver-
sity; analysing species for admixture and hybridization;
studying for evidence of local adaptation; and poten-
tially exploring epigenetic diﬀerences; we will address
one of the most exciting and topical questions in biol-
ogy: how quickly can species evolve under new selec-
tion pressures? In the second component we will extend
the analysis to include insect and fungi introduced for
classical biological control. Finally, in component 3,
we want to combine mathematical models and ecolog-
ical studies with analyses of gene ﬂow to understand
dispersal distances and invasion pathways of major in-
vasive alien species in South Africa. We have a quite
a bit of ﬂexibility in the projects, and expect that the
students would focus on issues or groups that interested
them and, after preliminary analysis, would identify ad-
ditional research questions.
Requirements: Hons: excellent marks at undergradu-
ate level * a keen interest in molecular ecology * excel-
lent communication skills (speaking, reading, writing)
in English and sound mathematical literacy * ability
to work independently and take initiative * an inter-
est of some of the main issues in conservation * ability
to work within a team * willingness to work extended
hours when required * knowledge of basic laboratory
etiquette * willingness to travel overseas for training.
MSc (in addition to the above): experience in working
in a molecular lab PhD (in addition to the above): ev-
idence of producing work published or publishable in
international journals * presentations given at national
and/or international meetings.
Recommendations: Experience in working with micro-
satellite markers * experience of working with and16 EvolDir January 1, 2008
analysing population genetic data * experience of eco-
logical ﬁeld-work * papers published in international
journals * an interest in botany, ecology and/or social
history.
Closing date: We are currently looking for students to
start in the 2008 academic year, but enthusiastic can-
didates with out-standing academic records may apply
at any time of the year (except honours students who
must start beginning of February).

The PhD-fellow will work on a theoretical project focus-
ing on mathematical, quantitative genetic, evolution-
ary models for the eﬀects of escaped farmed salmon
of genetic variability and ﬁtness of populations of wild
Atlantic salmon. The main areas of research will be
multitrait evolution, intrusion histories and alterna-
tive demographic-evolutionary equilibria, parameter es-
timation, stochastic simulation of explicit genetic mod-
els, and models for the loss of genetic variation in
the farmed-wild population system. The project, ﬁ-
nanced by the Norwegian Research Council, is a collab-
oration between the Dept. of Mathematical Sciences,
NTNU, and researchers at NINA, Akvaforsk and Impe-
rial Collage, London. The fellowship is also linked to

are available at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmen-
tal Research - UFZ, Department of Community Ecol-
ogy, in Halle, Germany, starting in March 2008.
The two students will be involved in innovative re-
search on the evolutionary consequences of environ-
mental change, carried out within the framework
of the Biodiversity Exploratories ( www.biodiversity-
exploratories.de ). They will study the impact of lan-
duse on the genetics & evolution of grassland plants in
two complementary projects:
STUDENT 1 will mainly work in the ﬁeld of popula-
tion genetics. S/he will use molecular markers to study
the relationship between species diversity and genetic
diversity, and to test the hypothesis that this relation-
ship depends on a balance between gene ﬂow/drift and20 EvolDir January 1, 2008
colonisation/extinction processes. The student will also
carry out pollination experiments in the ﬁeld. (Contact:
Dr. Walter Durka, walter.durka@ufz.de)
STUDENT 2 will work in the ﬁeld of quantitative ge-
netics. S/he will use a combination of ﬁeld studies
and common garden experiments to examine how land
use aﬀects quantitative genetic diversity of plant traits,
their heritability, and the strength and direction of nat-
ural selection acting upon them. (Contacts: Dr. Har-
ald Auge, harald.auge@ufz.de and Dr. Oliver Bossdorf,
oliver.bossdorf@ufz.de)
Both projects will be done on the same set of grassland
species. The two PhD students will closely interact.
The Biodiversity Exploratories are a large collabora-
tive ecological research initiative, funded by the Ger-
man Science Foundation, that will allow the students
to get in contact with many other excellent ecologists.
We are looking for ambitious students with a keen in-
terest in ecology and evolution. They must have a Uni-
versity degree (MSc or similar) and a driving licence,
and they should be ﬂuent in English. Previous experi-
ence in population genetics (Student 1), ecological ex-
periments and statistics (Student 2) is a plus but not
a requirement. Part of the work will be carried out in
the beautiful landscapes of the three Exploratories sites
(Schw¨ abische Alb, Hainich, Schorfheide) where the stu-
dents must be able to conduct independent and thor-
ough ﬁeld work.
The positions are for 3 years. They are subject to
the ﬁnal funding decision by the DFG. The primary
place of work will be Halle. Salary will be according
to the civil service level Tv¨ oD-O 13/2. The PhD stu-
dents will have the opportunity to participate in the
newly established Graduate School HIGRADE ( http:/-
/www.ufz.de/index.php?en=11429 ). Women are ex-
plicitly encouraged to apply to increase their share in
science and research.
The Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research –
UFZ ( http://www.ufz.de ) is the largest public research
centre in Germany entirely devoted to the study of envi-
ronmental problems, with a particular strength in eco-
logical sciences. Halle is a medium-sized city 150 km

Fall 2008 to study the ecological genetics of invasive
species, including plant pathogens. Fellowships oﬀer a
highly competitive stipend as well as funds for research
and travel.
The University of Georgia has received a Partnerships
for International Research and Education (PIRE) grant
from the National Science Foundation to support re-
search on the genetics and ecology of invasive plant and
pathogen species exchanged between the southeastern
US and China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Successful ap-
plicants will develop research projects that will study
the population genetics, ecology and/or demography of
invasive species that are native to the southeastern US
and to China. A signiﬁcant proportion of each student’s
research project must be conducted in China in collab-
oration with Chinese research scientists. Students will
receive training in Chinese language and culture as well
as appropriate biology courses.
Students can work with any senior personnel on the
UGA-PIRE program (see list below and at http:/-
/www.genetics.uga.edu/pire/people senior US.html ).
Students should contact a prospective major adviser
directly and apply through that department. For
additional information concerning the application
process, interested students should refer to our website

Call for three PhD candidates to work with an interna-
tional networkOur research group is involved in an international col-
laboration. As part of this collaborative network, three
100% positions as a PhD student in applied evolution
are available at Hedmark University College, Faculty
of Forestry and Wildlife Management at Evenstad in
Norway from April 1.2008 to March 31.2011. We ac-
cept applications from any qualiﬁed person. Whoever
is appointed will be based at our Faculty at Evenstad
in Norway, but will be formally tied to a university in
our team that is accredited to give PhDs (e.g., Oslo,
Trondheim).
The position is attached to the scientiﬁc project “Ex-
tinction mechanisms in small populations: Linking the-
ory, experiments and observational studies in a compar-
ative setting”. The project is ﬁnanced by the Research
Council of Norway and Hedmark University College.
In the project Hedmark University College collaborates
with scientists from the universities in Oslo (Nils Chr.
Stenseth), Trondheim (Bernt-Erik S¨ ı¿1
2ther), Troms¨ ı¿1

(Rolf A. Ims), Paris (Jean-Fran¨ ı¿1
2ois Le Galliard),
Jyv¨ ı¿1
2skyl¨ ı¿1
2(Hannu Yl¨ ı¿1
2nen), London (E-J Milner
Gulland) and Aberdeen (Xavier Lambin).
The project aims at linking population biological the-
ory to applied evolutionary questions of population ex-
tinction using experimental and observational studies of
several small rodent populations. This comparative ap-
proach between experimental and observational studies,
between species varying in ways that may essentially

ogy has recently been ranked #1 nationally among En-
tomology graduate programs, and the students will join
a leading laboratory in insect molecular systematics
with close ties to other top insect systematics labs both
on campus and at the Illinois Natural History Survey.
Molecular systematics of the hyperdiverse genus /Het-
erospilus/
Funded by NSF DEB 0717365, this 4-year project
encompasses a multigene molecular phylogeny of the
speciose braconid wasp genus /Heterospilus/. Under
the direction of Dr. Whitﬁeld, the student will extract,
amplify and sequence each of 3 genes from roughly 200
species of wasp, and conduct molecular phylogenetic
analyses to test monophyly of the genus worldwide, and
to explore relationships within the genus, especially for
the neotropical fauna. Parallel to this work, collabora-
tor Paul Marsh ( http://www.life.uiuc.edu/whitﬁeld/-
Paul Marsh.html ) and a postdoctoral associate (posi-
tion currently being advertised) will conduct a taxo-
nomic revision of the genus, and produce online inter-
active identiﬁcation keys to the 200+ species in Costa
Rica. Some experience in insect systematics, molecular
phylogenetics and/or phylogenetic analysis methods is
highly desirable for the graduate student part of the
project. The position is available as soon as Summer
2008. Application should be at the Ph. D. level.

Graduate Research in Behavioral Evolution of Stalk-
Eyed Flies
I have an opening for a Ph. D. graduate student inter-
ested in research on the performance and ﬁtness conse-
quences of elaborate secondary sexual characters in in-
sects using stalk-eyed ﬂies as a model. Stalk-eyed ﬂies
provide the ideal model system to test for costs and
tradeoﬀs related to male ornamentation. All species
in this extraordinary family display exaggerated head
morphology, with eyes and antennae displaced at the
end of long stalks, and interspeciﬁc variation in eye span
can be more than ten-fold. Furthermore, all available
evidence indicates that eye stalks are critical sexual sig-
nals used in both male-male competition and female
choice. This study will examine the eﬀects of elon-
gated eye stalks on ﬂight performance and survivor-
ship of stalk-eyed ﬂies to assess whether these eﬀects
run counter to the eﬀects of sexual selection. The po-
sition is part of an NSF-funded CAREER project in

Dear EvolDir Members,
We are seeking a marine molecular evolutionist to join
our team of marine biologists, physicists, and ecolo-
gists. You will have substantial postdoctoral experience
in population genetics, microsatellite analysis, DNA se-
quencing and spatial genetic analysis, preferably in ma-
rine systems. You will appreciate the role of hydrody-
namic ocean processes in structuring marine popula-
tions and know how to infer this relationship from ob-
served patterns of genetic population structure. You
will wish to work not only on describing aspects of
the marine environment, but also on approaches that
will assist state managers to assess current patterns of
evolutionary connectivity at large spatial scales and to
manage marine ecosystems and resources sustainably.
You will be committed to quality research that has
practical beneﬁt. You will have a commitment to team-
work and multidisciplinary research.
The oceanscape genetics research will focus on the use
of genetics to understand the role of large-scale oceano-
graphic processes in dispersal and population structure
in marine organisms in Western Australia (WA). Two
projects will be involved: population structure of the
spangled emperor ﬁsh within Ningaloo reef and more
broadly in the north west of WA, and stock structure
in the iconic WA ﬁsh, dhuﬁsh. The coast of WA is dom-
inated by the southward-ﬂowing Leeuwin Current and
associated eddies and wind-driven currents. Molecu-
lar genetics is a powerful tool for describing population

StGirons France Volunteer
DispersalEvolution
Volunteer Opportunity
We are looking for volunteers on a project examining
the evolution of dispersal and sociality. The themes of
this work are centered on the evolution of sociality (co-
operation), condition-dependent dispersal, and meta-
population dynamics. This project seeks to experimen-
tally manipulate parameters of dispersal behavior and
social aggregations to understand trade-oﬀs and key de-
terminants of the evolution of these behaviors. The
project is lab based, using Tetrahymena thermophila,
a unicellular ciliated protist, as a model organism. Our
recent work has shown genetic variation in dispersal
and cooperative behavior among clonal lines and has
investigated some elements of condition-dependent dis-
persal (information use, dispersal phenotypes). Future
work will examine evolutionary processes aﬀecting dis-
persal and the stability of social strategies that build
on these ﬁndings. Volunteers are expected to partici-
pate in maintenance of cultures, experimental manipu-
lations, and the best candidates will also be capable of
helping to plan experiments and process data.
This project is run in Dr. Jean Cloberts lab and stu-
dents will work with both Dr. Clobert and Dr. Alexis
Chaine. The lab is situated in the foothills of the French
Pyrenees Mountains at a CNRS ﬁeld station (Moulis /
Saint Girons). Students will be provided with hous-
ing but will be expected to cover their other expenses.
Work is ongoing and volunteers can begin at a nego-
tiated date. Duration of work is ﬂexible, and while
volunteers are expected to commit to a minimum of 4
weeks, priority will be given to those who can commit
to longer periods.

Automated DNA extractor
Our laboratory is looking into purchasing an automated
DNA extractor for extracting DNA predominantly from
whole blood. The two units we are considering are
the Qiacube from Qiagen and the Maxwell 16 from
Promega. Does anyone have any experience with ei-
ther of these machines?

Diversity project
Dear Colleagues,
For the fourth consecutive year, we will be running The
Diversity Project, an NSF funded research opportunity
at for under-represented minority undergraduate stu-
dents . In collaboration between Boston University, Old
Dominion University and Duke University, students will
integrate hands-on ﬁeld research in the Coral Triangle
with cutting edge genetic research. The project will ex-
plore the origins marine biodiversity in the Coral Trian-
gle in an eﬀort to improve conservation of this remark-
able ecosystems. Students are fully funded for both liv-ing and travel expenses. Visit http://people.bu.edu/-
pbarber/Intro.htm for more information and on-line ap-
plication.
This research opportunity has been a remarkable per-
sonal and professional experience for the students who
have participated. Please encourage any students
whom you believe would beneﬁt from such an expe-
rience to apply. Applications are due January 15, 2008.
For further information, please contact Dr. Paul Barber
(pbarber@bu.edu). We look forward to hearing from
you.

F statistic sample size
I want to look at parasites in a number of separate hosts
to check for non-random breeding within hosts. Ob-
viously there will be diﬀerences in genotypes between
hosts (Fst) and non-random mating would show up as
a signiﬁcant Fis value. The problem is what sample size
would I need to detect a given value of Fis? It looks
like most people avoid the issue of sample size or power
calculations when doing F statistics. The best recent
one I could come up with isJanuary 1, 2008 EvolDir 43
N. Patterson, A. L. Price, and D. Reich. Population
structure and eigenanalysis. Plos Genetics 2 (12):2074-
2093, 2006.
They present calculations for Fst between two popu-
lations and state that the minimum Fst that can be
reasonable detected is 1/sqrt(nm) where n is no of indi-
viduals and m is no. of molecular markers. Would it be
outrageous to extrapolate this to Fis so that, for exam-
ple, examining parasites from 100 animals would have
power to detect a minimum Fis of 1/sqrt(100)=0.1?

Isopod SingleCopyNuclearGenes for
phylogenies
Dear members of the evoldir
SINGLE COPY nuclear genes for plylogenesis in
isopods(slower rate than 12s, 16s and COI)
my laboratory used to study mostly mitochondrial
genes.But we decided to study this time nuclear genes.
is there a SINGLE COPY nuclear gene with slower
evolutionary rate than 12s , 16s, and COI which i
could used in order to study the phylogenesis of isopods
(genus:Ligidium).Due to economical and technical rea-
sons we dont use cloning methods, so if this gene exist
in 2 copies it would be diﬃcult only by using the gel ex-traction method to purify the appropriate band, cause
this technique (gel extraction) has never met with suc-
cess.
I have just decided to study the gene EF-1a in the genus
Ligidium(Isopods) does anybody knows if in isopods
EF-1a exist as a single copy??? or if there 2 copies of
that gene ( one pseudogene 400 b.p. and another one
with an intron at 700 b.p.) as it has been proved in
other arthropods??
your help is essential for my master completion im look-
ing forward for your answers

MacOSX PopGenet software
answers
Dear all,
First of all thanks a lot for the responses I had to
my question about user-friendly population genetics
programs that run in Mac OSX. Unfortunately, there
doesn’t seem to exist such a programme with a graphi-
cal interface, which I ﬁnd curious given that Macs used
to be more user-friendly than Windows. Here I post
the answsers I have had.
Cheers,
Ramiro
1) What about running DnaSP/DAMBE/etc. on Win-
dows (with bootcamp or Parallels) on the Mac instead?
2) Given your post on the Evoldir, I cannot help but
plug my own software, GenoDive. However, it does not
handle sequences, but it does handle most other types
of genetic markers and can perform several diﬀerent
analyses with them, among which AMOVA’s. Anyway,
as far as I can tell myself it is very user friendly, and
may be useful to you for some other purposes. The
current version can be downloaded from my website:
http://www.bentleydrummer.nl/software . Please keep
in mind that it is a beta version, so there may still be
some bugs.
3) The package of software written by Kevin Thornton
and Eli Stahl (molpopgen) is excellent and very ﬂexible.
This package is written in C++, and it was relatively
painless to compile on my Mac (which runs OSX Tiger).
In particular, the ’analysis’ package can do most of the44 EvolDir January 1, 2008
analyses that DnaSP can do.
4) I saw your post of Evoldir. There is nothing that
I am aware of in terms of software with a graphical
interface. On Intel-based macs, you can run DNAsp
through one of the many windows emulators available
(Parallels, VMware, etc.). Alternatively, I have writ-
ten several software packages of command-line appli-
cations which are portable across many Unix systems,
and work ﬁne on OS X. http://www.molpopgen.org
5) Kevin Thornton has a set of applications (MKtest,
compute, polydNdS) for this sort of thing that work
well on Mac OSX; they are available at molpopgen.org.
They are not as user-friendly as DnaSP - you have to
run them from the terminal, and you will need to com-
pile them from C++ source code (after downloading
and installing libraries - instructions are on the website
too).
6) You could try GenAlEx6 or Genepop 4.0.
7) You can use Jeﬀrey Townsend’s SeqPop that
runs command-line on the terminal: http://-
www.yale.edu/townsend/software.html A similar op-
tion is Kevin Thornton’s collection of command-line
programs that use his libsequence library: http:/-
/molpopgen.org/software/lseqsoftware.html A nice
Java program is Fu & Li’s NeutralityTest: http:/-
/www.hgc.sph.uth.tmc.edu/neutrality test It imple-
ments a variety of tests, like Fu’s, Fu & Li’s, Tajima’s,
Fay & Wu’s, MK, HKA, LWL, Suzuki-Gojobori.
There a way to run Windows programs without in-
stalling Windows per se. The application is called
WINE and exists for Linux. It was recently ported to
OSX. There is the DarWINE project, but the current
version is for PowerPC (PPC) architecture, not Intel-
based Macs. This requires getting your hands dirty
and installing libraries, compiling, etc. A company
called CodeWeavers ( http://www.codeweavers.com/-
products/cxmac ) are selling CrossOver for the Mac and
Linux, so as to run Windows applications seemlessly.
The academic price is $42 and DnaSP runs just ﬁne.
If you have long sequences, like genomic data, the
DnaSP crew has written VariScan: http://www.ub.es/-
softevol/variscan If you’re interested in simulations and
test statistics, Sebas Ramos-Onsins from the Univ. of
Barcelona has written mlSimCoal (based on Hudson’s
famous ms program): http://www.ub.es/softevol/-
mlcoalsim Peter Andolfatto from UCSD has a few pro-
grams like that at http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/labs/-
andolfatto/Programs.html 8) Have you tried Arlequin
( lgb.unige.ch/arlequin/ )? Although I haven’t used the
Mac version, they do have one and it does alot of tests,
including neutrality. Once you get your dataset into
the proper format (GenePop on the web can do this foryou), which is a pain, it’s fairly user friendly.

MammalianMarkersDatabase
OrthoMaM
Dear Evoldir members,
We have constructed and released a database of Orthol-
ogous Mammalian Markers (OrthoMaM) that might be
useful for people interested in placental mammal phy-
logenetics and phylogenomics.
Brieﬂy, the EnsEMBL database was used to determine
a set of orthologous genes from 12 available complete
mammalian genomes (human, chimp, macaque, mouse,
rat, rabbit, cow, dog, armadillo, elephant, tenrec, and
opossum). More than 3,000 exons of length >400
bp have been selected as targets for possible ampli-
ﬁcation and sequencing in additional taxa. A bioin-
formatic pipeline has been developed to provide evolu-
tionary descriptors (base composition, maximum like-
lihood model parameters, relative evolutionary rate,
variability among codon positions) for these candidate
markers in order to assess their potential phylogenetic
utility. The resulting OrthoMaM (Orthologous Mam-
malian Markers) database can be queried and align-
ments can be downloaded through a dedicated web in-
terface:
http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/orthomam We expect
the OrthoMaM database to be useful for further re-
solving the phylogenetic tree of placental mammals at
diﬀerent taxonomic levels and for better understanding
the evolutionary dynamics of their genomes, i.e., the
forces that shaped coding sequences in terms of selec-
tive constraints.
The paper describing the database is freely available

Mus musculus samples
Dear Evoldir members,
I work on the colonization history of the house mouse
(Mus musculus) in several Atlantic islands. I would
be very interested to examine some samples from pos-
sible continental sources, especially from Africa (any-
where would be great, particularly North-East Africa)
and South America. If anyone has access to specimens
(tail tips, feet, toes, skin, etc) and would be willing
to share them, I would be very grateful. Also, if you
have a cat that is a good mouse hunter and sometimes
leaves you some animals as presents on your door step
that would be great as well! Please contact me ( soﬁ-
agabriel@hotmail.com or sg542@york.ac.uk ) for fur-
ther info.
Thank you so much in advance,

Nb estimation using linkage
Dear EvolDir folks,
I have a sample from a single cohort of juvenile frogs
and am wondering if I can apply the linkage disequi-
librium method (as implemented in the NeEstimator
program) to this sample to get an estimate of the eﬀec-tive number of the parents (*N*b) that produced the
juvenile cohort. Can anyone verify or refute this? I
have microsatellite genotype data for the juveniles as
well as the adults, so I will have an *N*b estimate from
the temporal method as well. I am hoping to use the
LD method to get an additional estimate of *N*b.
Any of your comments on this issue will be greatly ap-
preciated!
Thank you,

SelﬁshDNA Diseases
Selﬁsh DNA and the genetic control of vector-borne
diseases Catalysis Meeting access to public Wiki
Selﬁsh genetic elements spread and maintain them-
selves in populations even though they have negative
impacts on the ﬁtness of organisms. They are of interest
from an applied and a basic evolutionary perspective,
and they are being studied from molecular and popu-
lation dynamics/genetics perspectives. Although there
are exceptions, most individual researchers take a single
perspective in studying selﬁsh DNA, interact with oth-
ers who have that perspective, and tend to have only
a superﬁcial understanding and appreciation for work
on selﬁsh DNA conducted at diﬀerent levels or with
diﬀerent goals. There has been recent interest in us-
ing selﬁsh genetic elements to drive anti-pathogen genes
into disease-vectoring pest populations in order to sup-
press transmission of human diseases such as dengue
and malaria. We feel that the progress of research
toward this goal has been hampered by a lack of in-
terdisciplinary interaction. To help remedy this situa-
tion we held a workshop at NESCent on December 5,6
and 7th 2007which brought together researchers work-
ing on selﬁsh DNA whose work is centered at diﬀerent
points along the continuum from basic to applied and
from the molecular to population level. This workshop
would fostered discussion among these researchers and
we hope that it leads to new approaches for using self-
ish genetic elements to control vector-borne diseases.
To broaden the reach of this workshop we have estab-
lished a publically available wiki that can be reached at
https://www.nescent.org/wg selﬁshdna This wiki con-
tains information on the workshop including pdfs of
some of the presentations, pdfs of pertainent articles
and preprints, as well as a link to user friendly computer

pathogen genes. Some novel gene drive strategies are

Software DAMBE
Dear Colleagues,
I have just uploaded a new version of DAMBE (4.5.66)
at
http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/dambe.asp The installa-48 EvolDir January 1, 2008
tion instructions (as well as the installation package)
are at
http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/-
dambe installation instructions.asp It ﬁxed a number
of bugs (including a bug in the neighbour-joining
method introduced perhaps quite sometime ago).
In particular, the new version has a few new genetic
distances for phylogenetic studies with simultaneous es-
timation methods (see below). The traditional genetic
distances were computed separately for each pair of se-
quences independent of other pairs. For example, the
traditional K80 distance is derived from maximing the
likelihood:
Lij = Prob(sequences |dij, kij) where k ij is the tran-
sition/transversion ratio. Such a distance is called an
IE (independently estimated) distance and has been
criticized for having three problems. First, they some-
times cannot be computed, i.e., inapplicable cases, es-
pecially for highly diverged sequences. Second, it is
inconsistent because k ij values are often diﬀerent (i.e.,
k12<>k13<>k23, etc.). These problems are ex-
acerbated by limited sequence length. The third is in-
suﬃcient use of information because the computation
of pairwise distances ignores information in other se-
quences that should also contain information about the
divergence between the two compared sequences. The
DNADIST program in the PHYLIP package ﬁnds dij
that maximizes Lij with a ﬁxed transition/transversion
ratio for all sequence pairs, but then one has to guess
what transition/transversion ratio to use.
A simultaneous estimation method was presented by
Tamura et al. (2004, PNAS) and implemented in
MEGA4 for the TN93 model. In short, one ﬁnd all
distances as well as k1 and k2 that maximize
SL = Sum(lnL ij).
The computation is through an iterative process. One
ﬁrst ﬁnds an approximate estimate of k1 and k2, keeps
them ﬁxed and ﬁnd b ij values that maximizes L ij.
Then one ﬁxes then b ij values and ﬁnd k1 and k2 that
maximizes SL, and so on. Finally one scales b ij to d ij.
The distance seems to perform outstandingly well and
overcomes all three shortcomings we mentioned above
associated with IE distances. This distance is terms
“maximum composite likelihood” distance by Tamura
et al. In DAMBE, it appears as “ML-CompositeTN93”
and “ML-CompositeF84” in the menu for distance-
based method with nucleotide sequences (Click
’Phylogenetics |Distance method |Nucleotide sequence’,
with ML-compositeTN93 being the default). I will refer
to them as ML-composite distance for short.An alternative SE method is to use the least-square
method. Take the TN93 model for example. For each
pair of sequences, we have
SSij = (OP1 ij - EP1 ij)^2 + (OP2 ij - EP2 ij)^2 +
(OQ ij - EQ ij)^2, where letters “O” and E stand for
“observed” and “expected”, respectively.
We now ﬁnd all d ij and k1 and k2 that minimize
SS = Sum(SS ij)
I have implemented this distance for both the F84 and
TN93 models and they appear as “LS-compositeF84”
and “LS-compositeTN93” in DAMBE’s menu for
distance-based method (Click ’Phylogenetics |Distance
method |Nucleotide sequence’). The distance seems to
perform at least as good as ML-composite distances,
and takes only about half as many cycles to converge.
I should appreciate your feedback.
For those who have not heard of DAMBE, it is a free
integrated software package on the Windows platform
for molecular sequence analysis. It recognize many dif-
ferent sequence formats, performs a variety of sequence
alignment and phylogenetic analysis and is also a bioin-
formatics workbench (with position weight matrix and
Gibbs sampler to identify function motifs, perceptron
for identifying the diﬀerences between two group of
sequences, dynamic programming algorithms for pre-
dicting RNA secondary structure and tRNA anticodon,
HMM for protein secondary structure prediction, etc.).
It takes only a few mouse clicks to install. To get
started, just click ’File |Open standard sequence ﬁles’
and read in some sample ﬁles that come with DAMBE
(in the C: \program ﬁles \DAMBE directory).

Software TNT
One of the major programs for phylogenetic analysis,
TNT (of Goloboﬀ, Farris, and Nixon, 2003), formerly
available for a license fee, has just been released as
a free program, subsidized by the Willi Hennig Soci-
ety. The program is available for download from itsJanuary 1, 2008 EvolDir 49
web site, http://www.zmuc.dk/public/phylogeny/tnt .
Overview:
a.. Windows versions with GUI; all versions can be
interactively driven with commands b.. a simple but
powerful scripting language allows customization and
“programming” of complex routines or simulations c..
Linux/Mac versions can run in parallel d.. Reads
Nona/Hennig86 input data, as well as basic Nexus ﬁles.
e.. Can export data and results easily to Nexus format
f.. can overimpose legends on tree-branches (e.g. dif-
ferent support measures). Optimality criteria:
a.. analyses under pre-deﬁned weights b.. analyses
under implied-weights, either with standard or user-
deﬁned weighting functions (the latter including def-
inition of clique-like weighting) c.. analyses under
self-weighted optimization (i.e. dynamic weighting of
character-state transformations) d.. standard (Fitch,
Farris) characters, easily deﬁnable branched characters
(=character-state trees), Sankoﬀ (=step-matrix char-
acters), continuous characters (from 0 to 65, with up
to three decimals) e.. searches optionally collapse zero-
length branches under diﬀerent criteria (including SPR-
TBR collapsing), or retain all distinct dichotmous trees
Search options:
a.. exact (“branch-and-bound”) searches applicable to
relatively small data sets b.. random addition sequences
plus TBR, applicable to medium sized data sets. c.. the
fastest SPR-TBR swapping algorithms of any program
d.. variety of search methods for large/complex data
sets (sectorial searches, ratcheting and tree-drifting,
tree-fusing and tree-hybridization) e.. recursive sec-
torial searches, using user-deﬁned commands to ana-
lyze sectors f.. searches highly customizable via simple
scripts g.. positive and negative constraints, ﬂexibly
deﬁned h.. time-bound searches i.. can search for sub-
optimal trees (based on either ﬁt diﬀerence and/or rel-
ative ﬁt diﬀerence). Tree diagnosis:
a.. parsimonious mapping of character states b.. lists of
synapomorphies c.. can summarize mappings or lists of
synapomorphies based on sets of trees rather than one
tree at a time d.. can display all most parsimonious
reconstructions e.. counts of speciﬁc types of transfor-
mations f.. through the scripting language, it allows
ﬁnding best state assignments with a ﬁxed state at one
or more nodes (for a given tree) Tree comparisons:
a.. strict, combinable components, majority, and fre-
quency diﬀerence consensus trees b.. Semi-strict con-
sensus supertrees, easy creation of MRP matrices (for
subsequent supertree analysis under either parsimony
or cliques) c.. ﬁnds taxa to prune to improve strict
and combinable consensus trees d.. tree-distances: dis-
tortion coeﬃcient, SPR-distances, agreement subtrees.
Others can be easily calculated in conjunction withscripting language (e.g. number of “ﬂippings”, distance
under MRP, triplets). e.. algorithms that help ﬁnd
taxa to prune to improve majority rule or frequency

AdelaideU AncientDNA
Senior Research Associate (The Molecular Biology of
Archaeology and Forensics) A 3-year Australian Re-
search Council (ARC)-funded postdoc position is avail-
able at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA in Ade-
laide from early 2008, to research and develop rev-
olutionary new methods to extract and characterise
DNA from a range of unusual ancient samples including
sunken ship timbers, stone tools, hominid bones and
teeth, and sediments. The project is an ARC LINK-
AGE collaboration with the National Geographic So-
ciety, Australian Federal Police, and Forensics South
Australia. The main aim of the project is to re-design
current ancient/damaged DNA approaches from the
ground up, and to develop and extend recent new ap-
proaches to PCR such as SPEX (Brotherton et al. NAR
2007), and genomic library construction.
The candidate will need ﬁrst-rate molecular biology
knowledge and experience with an ability to work from
a ﬁrst principles basis, with minimal reliance on kits
and pre-designed systems. The work will be experimen-tally challenging due to the diﬃcult nature of the ge-
netic templates, but this is a rewarding opportunity to
undertake a complete re-design of current ancient DNA
and molecular archaeological practice. An interest in
ancient DNA, archaeology or natural history would be
very useful, but the key requirement is expertise at the
fundamental level in molecular biology and to a lesser
extent, biochemistry.
The position will be supported by a 0.5 FTE tech-
nician, and will make use of the international qual-
ity ACAD facilities ( <ﬁle:// www.adelaide.edu.au/-
ACAD >www.adelaide.edu.au/ACAD ), and an exten-
sive collection of >4,000 ancient samples from locations
around the world covering the past 200,000 years.
ACAD is housed within the Department of Earth and
Environmental Sciences, in the centrally located Uni-
versity of Adelaide (currently ranked 62nd in the world
by the THES-QS). Research activities concentrate on
molecular evolution, natural history, ancient DNA
methods and practice, human evolution and forensics.
ACAD is the ancient DNA node for the National Ge-
ographic Society’s Genographic Project, using multi-
plexed SBE typing to analyse ancient human samples
collected from around the world. Adelaide itself of-
fers a very high standard of living (top 6 in the world,January 1, 2008 EvolDir 51
The Economist), with attractive weather, food, wine
and beach environments, in an inexpensive setting with
strong investment in Green Environments and Alterna-
tive Energy policies.

Project: understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of
seasonal inﬂuenza
A few studies have explored the inter-pandemic pat-
terns of spatial spread of inﬂuenza, or the dynamics of
genetic and antigenic evolution of inﬂuenza A viruses.
This collaborative project between the Inﬂuenza Divi-
sion, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and The MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis
and Modeling, Imperial College London, proposes to in-
tegrate these two aspects of inﬂuenza ecology and ana-
lyze inﬂuenza illness, excess mortality, and viral surveil-
lance data collected by the Inﬂuenza Division, CDC. In-
ﬂuenza activity across the United States is monitored
by several systems that operate on diﬀering time and
spatial scales. The inﬂuenza surveillance system in-
cludes inﬂuenza viral data, inﬂuenza-like-illness (ILI)
data, excess mortality data, and data on the antigenic
characterization of circulating viruses.
This collaborative project has several initial planned
activities. First, datasets will be collated, cleaned,
and normalized. At this stage, other datasets which
could be relevant for this project will also be identi-
ﬁed. Second, after examination of the consistency be-
tween the diﬀerent data sources, epidemic patterns will
be identiﬁed by using relevant methods for visualizing
the data (e.g., time series, mapping, and movies) and
a range of descriptive analysis. Spatial aspects of epi-
demics dynamics will be studied, including when and
where epidemics start and how they spread across the
United States and its territories. Inﬂuenza type and
sub-type interactions will be investigated by examining
the co-circulation and predominance of viruses during
epidemics. Descriptive analysis methods which might
be used include time series, wavelet and spatial correla-
tion analysis. This work will allow the development of
readily understandable and interactive representations
of inﬂuenza activity for public health professionals and
non-specialists, including policy makers.The third component of the project will examine a va-
riety of methods to use existing ILI and virus isolation
data in further developing modeling of excess inﬂuenza-
related mortality. Speciﬁcally, approaches to including
simple mechanistic models of inﬂuenza-related mortal-
ity will be examined. A particular focus will be on re-
gional or more ﬁnely geographically disaggregated mod-
els.
The fourth component of this project, which will be de-
veloped in parallel with the second and third, will ex-
plore hypotheses for the ecological drivers of the spatial
dynamics of inﬂuenza transmission, inﬂuenza evolution,
and the development of population immunity. By ﬁt-
ting space-time multi-strain models to surveillance and
antigenic data, we will estimate immunity proﬁles of
the population at the start and the end of each annual
epidemic. The aim will be to highlight interactions be-
tween types and sub-types and to attempt to predict
population immunity proﬁles from one season to subse-
quent seasons. An important part of this mechanistic
modeling will be estimation of the eﬀect of climate and
other factors on the seasonality of inﬂuenza transmis-
sion in diﬀerent U.S. regions. Analyses of this type
are diﬃcult to do with existing regression models, as
the dynamical coupling between diﬀerent regions (me-
diated by population movements) may induce strong
correlations in disease incidence between locations.

ology at the University of California, Riverside. The
focus of the research is to investigate the population
biology of Pyricularia grisea, causal agent of gray leaf
spot of turf and rice blast. This work is currently in
progress, therefore, a qualiﬁed candidate would have
the opportunity to immediately begin collecting geno-
typic data using AFLP and/or microsatellite markers
from sampled populations. DNA has been extracted
from a large collection of isolates and mating type data
has already been collected. This could prove to be a
fruitful position for an ambitious candidate since there
could be many additional research opportunities to
work on other projects within the two labs. Candidates
should have a Ph.D. degree in plant pathology, genet-
ics/genomics, bioinformatics/computational biology, or
related disciplines. Proven ability to publish is highly
desirable. Good analytical skills within population ge-
netics and/or systematics are expected. Interest and/or
experience working with fungi is not essential but is de-
sirable. The position has guaranteed funding for one
year with a high likelihood of multi-year extension of
funding. Salary is commensurate with experience and
qualiﬁcations, with a minimum of $32,000/year. Post-
doctoral researchers receive full University of California
beneﬁts. Interested individuals should send a curricu-

Post-doctoral position in theoretical evolutionary biol-
ogy
Available at the Center for Ecological and Evolutionary
Synthesis (CEES), Department of Biology, Faculty of
Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Oslo
A postdoctoral research position is available to work
with Prof. Thomas F. Hansen on topics in theoreti-
cal biology. The appointment is for two years and is
funded through the University. Preferred starting date
is as soon as possible. The general topic of the lab con-
cerns the evolution of evolvability and the interplay be-
tween adaptation and constraints. These questions are
approached through mathematical and computational
modeling, through data analysis, and through develop-
ment of new methods of statistical analysis. Several of
the ongoing projects in the lab are focused on under-
standing how the structure of the genotype-phenotype
map, including epistasis and pleiotropy, aﬀects the vari-
ability and evolvability of phenotypic traits. We are
studying genetic architecture both through dynamical
modeling and through the development and applica-
tion of statistical methodology. One possible project
involves modeling of gene-regulatory networks with the
aim of understanding the eﬀects of network structure
on evolvability. Other projects are focused on devel-60 EvolDir January 1, 2008
oping and applying methods for assessing evolvability,
selection, and rates of evolution in time series or com-
parative data.
The position is ﬂexible in regard to the exact topic of
research, and the successful applicant can be involved
in any one of several ongoing projects.
The position oﬀers ample opportunity to work at the
interface between theory and data analysis within a
broader group of researchers and students with strong
expertise in theoretical and statistical modeling. The
successful candidate will be encouraged to pursue
his/her own ideas as long as these fall within the broad
topic of the lab.
We are seeking a candidate with interest in theoretical
and conceptual issues of evolutionary biology and evo-
lutionary genetics including the relationship between
genotype and phenotype and the role of constraints in
evolution. Expertise in one or more of the following ar-
eas is particularly relevant: Mathematical or computer
modeling, statistics, developmental genetics, and pop-
ulation/evolutionary genetics. Applicants must hold
a degree equivalent to a Norwegian doctoral degree.
Please contact Thomas Hansen at the below address
for more detail.
The CEES is a semi-autonomous interdisciplinary re-
search group within the Department of Biology that

AvianEvolutionaryGenomics
Post-doc in evolutionary genomics
at the Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala Univer-
sity, Sweden Centre of Excellence in Evolutionary Ge-
nomics
Genome sequencing (6x coverage) of the second bird
species to have its genome characterised - the zebra
ﬁnch - has just been completed. A post-doc position
focusing on evolutionary genomic and molecular evolu-
tionary analysis of the zebra ﬁnch genome sequence is
now available in Hans Ellegren’s laboratory
The zebra ﬁnch is an important model species for neu-
robiology. and has led to several important discoveries.
The production of new neurons in adult brain was ﬁrst
reported in zebra ﬁnch, which challenged the univer-
sally held dogma that neurogenesis does not occur in
adults. Research in this species also demonstrated that
active synthesis of estrogen in the zebra ﬁnch brain,
causing masculine patterns of neural development and
challenging the view of estrogen being a strictly gonadal
steroid. Songbirds are unique among non-humans in
their combination of vocal sophistication and experi-
mental accessibility. Like humans, songbird vocaliza-
tions are learned and this learning process has close
similarities to human speech. For example, FOXP2,
the ﬁrst gene linked to speech disorder in humans is
also expressed in the neural song circuit of zebra ﬁnch,
especially at times of vocal learning.
The project involves whole-genome analysis of molec-
ular evolutionary processes in avian genomes. This
will include analyses of, among other things, adaptively
evolving genes, conserved non-coding DNAs, evolution
of novel genes and expansion of gene families. The
main source of data comes from the comparison of the
chicken and zebra ﬁnch genomes, as part of the ze-
bra ﬁnch genome sequencing project, however, there
is also sequence data from additional bird species ob-
tained through 454 sequencing. In addition, evolution
of gene expression will be studied based on transcrip-January 1, 2008 EvolDir 61
tome proﬁling and population genomic analyses will be
done based on large-scale SNP data.
The successful applicant must hold a PhD and should
have experience from large-scale molecular evolutionary
analyses using bioinformatic approaches. Programming
skills are desirable. The position is for two years, with
possibilities for extension, and is within a lab group of
about 10 people including PhD students and interna-
tional post-docs.
The position is immediately available and the search
will remain open until the position is ﬁlled.

UTuebingen Robot sex
I have funding for a 5-year, EU-funded postdoc po-
sition to work on virtual genetic recombination in
robots (“robot sex”) at the University of Tuebingen.
This position is part of the large interdisciplinary net-
work SYMBRION in which swarm robots are devel-
oped and used to study emergent properties (details on
www.symbrion.org ).
The position is available from 1st February 2008.
Work description 1. Development of a virtual genome
for robots with all options to recombine and improve
through selection and evolution. Testing this genome
on a simulation platform for initial optimization and de-
bugging before transplantation to real robots. 2. “Eco-
logical experiments” in which the evolution of sexuality
and gender is investigated using robots as an omnipo-
tent model system (many options, in part depending
on own interests and creativity, conﬂict and coopera-
tion within and between the sexes, within and between
“species”). 3. Attending SYMBRION meetings, re-
porting on progress to the other members of the frame-
work. 4. Although the project itself has guaranteed
core funding (salary and basic expenses), the successful
candidate is expected to apply for additional external
funding to generate a small research group with under-
graduate and postgraduate students.
Required qualiﬁcations The preferred candidate has re-62 EvolDir January 1, 2008
cently ﬁnished her/his Ph.D. degree in Theoretical Biol-
ogy, with a subject in the broad ﬁeld of the Evolution of
Sex or Sexual Selection. Good programming and com-
puter skills are essential in order to be able to share
in the development of simulation tools within the net-
work. Excellent communicative abilities (particularly
in English), a natural tendency to work in teams, and
to travel regularly to other partners are equally essen-
tial. The robot platform (electronics, hardware control)
will be developed by other groups. Nevertheless, some
experience in robotics or electronics may be useful in
order to optimize communication with the other part-
ners.
Working environment My group is particularly inter-
ested in the evolution of reproductive modes and antag-
onistic coevolution, e.g. between the sexes or between
parasites and hosts. We work on a wide variety of or-
ganisms in the ﬁeld as well as in the lab. The group
consists of a core of 10 university-appointed staﬀ (4 sci-
entists) plus 15 students, 9 of which are Ph.D. students.
Seewww.uni-tuebingen.de/evoeco for information.
We are a member of “EvE”, the Evolution and Ecol-
ogy Forum Tuebingen, which is an association of 15
Professors from the Faculties of Biology, Geosciences,
Informatics and from the Max-Planck-Planck Institute
of Developmental Biology. EvE is currently developing
into an interfacultary network studying the short-term
and long-term consequences of organismal interactions.
Tuebingen is a small, historical, university town in a
beautiful part of Europe, between the Black Forest and
the Swabian Alb. The climate is continental, with cold
winters and hot summers. Of particular importance
for this project is the close vicinity to the University
of Stuttgart (approx. 35 km), where the initiators of
SYMBRION are located and where the robot platform
is being developed. Tuebingen is quite cosmopolitan,
with a strong foreign community. It is easy to get
around with English, but learning a bit of German
helps.
Application Please send pdfs of your application docu-
ments (cv, application letter, 3 names of possible refer-
ees) to nico.michiels@uni-tuebingen.de. Selection will
start from 15 January 2008 and continue until the ul-
timate candidate has been identiﬁed. I am also happy

Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
playing an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecological communities. The construction
of phylogenetic trees is becoming a methodology that is
well-deﬁned, with broad agreement on the central issues
and questions. A nearly standard set of topics is now
taught as part of the curriculum at many colleges and
universities. On the other hand, application of phylo-
genetic methods to interesting problems outside of sys-
tematics is an area of special excitement, innovation,
and controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
In March, 2008, for the ninth year, we will teach a work-
shop for graduate students interested in applying phy-
logenetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The one-
week course will be an intensive exploration of problems
to which modern phylogenetic tools are being applied.
We cover a range of topics in biogeography, ecology,
conservation biology, phylogenomics, functional mor-
phology, macroevolution, speciation, and character evo-
lution. The course starts with recent advances in phylo-
genetic methodology, and then focuses on methods and
tools that can be brought to bear on these “applied”
issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held entirely at the Bodega Marine
Lab on the Northern California coast, which has ex-
tensive computing resources and on-site housing. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, discus-
sion, and training in software and internet tools. One
afternoon during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips
to local natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Finding, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees; phylogenetic databases * Recent advances in
tree reconstruction: Bayesian inference; stochastic opti-
mization strategies; divide-and-conquer methods; Garli
& other approaches * Analysis of character evolution–
theory: parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches;
null models and statistical testing * Analysis of char-
acter evolution–form and function of complex charac-
ter systems * Phylogeography; coalescent methods for
inferring migration rates and patterns * Phylogenetic
comparative methods * Phylogenetic perspectives on
biodiversity and conservation biology * Data mining of
sequence databases for phylogenetic analysis * Estima-
tion of divergence times from sequence data * Species
delimitation and phylogenetic taxonomyInstructors for the main workshop.
* H. Bradley Shaﬀer * Peter Wainwright * Tom Near
* Rich Glor * Phil Spinks * Justen Whittall * Brian
O’Meara * Alan Lemmon * Emily Moriarty Lemmon *

plus guest lecturers!!
Prerequisites. Students should have some familiarity
with phylogenetic methods through previous course-
work. Some experience with PAUP, PHYLIP, or other
programs for phylogeny reconstruction will be assumed.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $450. This includes
room and board at BML for duration of the course (ar-
riving March 8, leaving March 15) and transportation
from Davis to BML.

Introduction to Mathematical Models of the EPIDEMI-
OLOGY & CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES:
Short Course for Public Health Professionals, since
1990 1-12 September 2008 at Imperial College London
Our understanding of infectious-disease epidemiology
and control has been greatly increased in recent years
through mathematical modelling. Insights from this
increasingly-important and exciting ﬁeld are now in-January 1, 2008 EvolDir 65
forming policymaking at the highest levels, for pan-
demic inﬂuenza, SARS, HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, foot-
and-mouth disease and other infections.
Since 1990, this short course has ’demystiﬁed’ mathe-
matical modelling, and kept public-health profession-
als, policy makers, and medical and veterinary re-
searchers, up-to-date with what they need to know
about this fast-moving ﬁeld. It is taught by active re-
searchers in the world-leading Department of Infectious
Disease Epidemiology ( www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/-
research/researchthemes/publicandint/ide ), which ad-
vises public health agencies, governments, interna-
tional organisations, and pharmaceutical companies,
and hosts the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis &
Modelling, UNAIDS Epidemiology Reference Group
secretariat, Partnership for Child Development, and the
Gates Foundation-funded Schistosomiasis Control Ini-
tiative that has treated over 12 million children to date
in six countries in Africa.
Participants need only a very basic mathematical abil-
ity (high school level is more than suﬃcient): most
course participants do not use maths regularly, and
calculation is done using Excel and the user-friendly
modelling package, Berkeley Madonna; hence manip-
ulation of equations is not required. We oﬀer an op-
tional ’maths refresher’ day on Sunday 31 August, free
of charge.
This programme will be of interest worldwide to public
health professionals, policy makers, health economists,
commissioning agencies, immunologists, medical, vet-
erinary, biological and pharmaceutical scientists.

2008 EMBO World Practical Course: “Advanced Meth-
ods in Reconstructing Molecular Phylogenetic Rela-
tionships” March 3 to 9, 2008, Botanical Garden, Rio
de Janeiro
The use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evo-
lutionary history of molecular sequences is a vital part
of biological research. Such methods underpin stud-
ies on the evolution and epidemiology of plant and
animal parasites and disease-causing organisms, they
are needed to understand the contrasting roles of ver-
tical and horizontal inheritance in genome evolution,
and more generally they allow an objective analysis
of the patterns and processes generating biological di-
versity. To carry out phylogenetic analysis properly,
it is necessary to have a good understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses, principles and applications
of the key methods and approaches. The past few years
have seen have an explosion in new methods of analy-
sis including the application of Bayesian analysis meth-
ods in phylogeny reconstruction, the development of
improved non-homogeneous models that much better
represent the dynamics of sequence evolution, and the
development of methods for high-throughput genome-
wide analyses. This course has been designed to cater
for these newest of methods and for understanding how
they relate to the more traditional methods. We also
address the strengths and weaknesses of all kinds of
approach. Our goal is to teach technical sophistication
without losing sight of the need for a critical attitude
to data and analyses.
The web page for the 2006 course ( http://-
bioinf.ncl.ac.uk/molsys/ ) provides more information on
content, but please be aware that both course and web-
page are likely to be updated for the 2008 course.
Applying to come on the course >From past experience
we expect that demand will outstrip the availability of66 EvolDir January 1, 2008
places which we limit to around 25 students. EMBO
also require that we have a gender and nationality bal-
ance on the course. We also try to ensure a mix of ex-
perience and biological backgrounds from the students
who attend.
EMBO covers the costs of student accommodation and
communal meals for the duration of the course only. It
does not cover the cost of your travel to Rio. There
may be some monies to help to cover the travel costs to
Brazil of up to three students from outside of Western
Europe and North America.
To apply please send a one page cover letter detail-
ing why you wish to attend the course and what you
hope to get out of it. Also send a two page CV giv-
ing details of your experience and any presentations or
publications. Send your application by email to Mar-

Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of
Groningen aims for a leading position in education and
research by oﬀering a select number of TopMaster Pro-
grams. These international programs are designed to
provide an optimal preparation for a subsequent PhD
program and eventually for a scientiﬁc career. The Top-
Master Program in Ecology and Evolution, organized
by the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Studies
(CEES), is linked to top-research groups in the Faculty.
The teachers are all active researchers at diﬀerent re-
search departments within CEES, and as a student here
you will come into close contact with researchers at the
frontline of international science. Through intensive
student-teacher interactions during courses, seminars
and research projects, students get an intense training
in modern research paradigms and techniques. The pro-
gramme is highly selective and aimed at the brightest
and most ambitious students from all over the world.
All admitted students can apply for a scholarship. The
two-year program starts each year in September. The
deadline for application is 1 February 2008.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if itJanuary 1, 2008 EvolDir 67
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
