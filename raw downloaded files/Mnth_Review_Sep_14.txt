Conference: 2nd Annual International Frozen Zoo Cell
Culture Seminar: Training Scientists for Biobanking
and Biodiversity Research San Diego Zoo Institute for
Conservation Research, Escondido, CA U.S.A October
13 - 17, 2014.
The 2nd Annual International Frozen Zoo Cell Culture
Seminar will commence on October 13 and conclude on
October 17 at the facilities of the San Diego Zoo Insti-
tute for Conservation Research, in Escondido, Califor-
nia.
San Diego Zoo's Frozen Zoo is a premier collection of
living broblast cells from over 1,000 species of mam-
mals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.
Over ve days, the course will provide participants with
a \hands-on" learning experience with experts special-
ized in establishing cell lines for the Frozen Zoo. The
course will provide the opportunity to gain exposure to
and experience with:
Lab safety and aseptic technique review
Taking biopsies and establishing cell cultures using en-
zyme digestion and solid tissue explant methods
Optimizing broblast cell culture for mammalian,
avian, reptilian and amphibian species
Field method for viable freezing of skin biopsies in liq-
uid nitrogen
Freezing broblast cell cultures
Metaphase chromosome harvesting, staining, banding
and karyotyping
This course is designed to help scientists establish
biomedical and biotechnical research programs to initi-
ate sampling of the genetic diversity within their coun-
tries and starting their own collections similar to the
Frozen Zoo.
The registration fee for the 2nd Annual International
Frozen Zoo Cell Culture Seminar is $1,000.00. This in-
cludes meals, transportation from local lodging to the
San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, lab
supplies, instruction materials, course workbook and
protocols. Full and partial scholarships are being of-
fered and are sponsored by the American Genetic As-
sociation, Special Project Award.September 1, 2014 EvolDir 7
Due to limited space availability, an application process
is required for consideration. If you are interested in at-
tending please send an email with 2014 FZCCS in the
subject line to lwied@sandiegozoo.org. Upon receipt,
an application will be forwarded along with additional
information. All applications are due on Friday, August

StonyBrook Sticklebacks Jul26-31
The EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
ON STICKLEBACK BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION
will be held July 26 - 31, 2015 at Stony Brook Univer-
sity in Stony Brook, New York, USA.
VENUE, ACTIVITIES, AND COSTS: The talks will
be given in the theater of the Charles B. Wang Center,
(see campus map at http://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/-
map/newmap.pdf), and the posters will be displayed
during the Conference in the theater lobby. Registra-
tion will be about US $325, and will include attendance
of talks, breakfasts (5), morning (5) and afternoon (3)coee breaks, and food at the welcoming reception,
poster session, closing banquet, and after-dinner so-
cials, plus beverages at some social events.
HOUSING: The daily charge for dormitory housing (3
bedrooms per suite with shared bathroom and lounge)
will be about US $75 for a private room and US $62
per person for a room for two. Dormitory housing will
be in the new Nobel Dormitories, about 15 minutes
walk from the Wang Center. Hotel rooms adjacent to
the Wang Center will cost US $140 plus tax per day.
The Wang Center and Nobel Dormitories are about a
15 minutes walk from the Stony Brook Station of the
Long island Rail Road. Lunches and most dinners will
not be included in the registration fees, but reasonably
priced meals will be available on or near campus. Dor-
mitory housing will be available for at least two days
before and after the Conference to allow participants
to visit New York City or destinations on Long Island,
including the wine-growing region, the Hamptons, and
south shore beaches.
TRANSPORTATION: Stony Brook can easily be
reached by air, automobile, or train. International
ights come into John F. Kennedy (JFK) and Newark
Liberty (EWR) international airports, which connect
to Stony Brook by train. LaGuardia (LGA) and Long
Island MacArthur (ISP) airports have only domestic
ights and lack train service to Stony Brook. The Con-
ference website will provide more details on transporta-
tion.
GRADUATE STUDENT SUPPORT: We have received
a generous award from the American Genetic Associ-
ation to support participation by about 20 graduate
students in the Conference. Guidelines for application
for support will be posted on the Conference website.
CONTACT: Please contact me at my Stony Brook
email address if you would like to receive future no-
tices, have colleagues who should receive future notices,
or have any questions about the Conference. I expect
the Conference website to open in December 2014 .

PhD / PostDoc Position in Invasion Ecology-^A^A^A^A^A^A^A^A open until lled
The GEOMAR Helmholtz-Centre for Ocean Research
Kiel oers a position for an early stage researcher
(PhD/PostDoc) interested in studying adaptation of
non-indigenous species to dierent salinities.
The position will be within the project \Do Ponto-
Caspian species have inherent advantages over North-
ern European or Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River
species in colonizing new areas?" funded by the Alexan-
der von Humboldt Sofja Kovalevskaja Award. The
overarching goal of the project is to determine if species
evolved in particular regions have inherent advantages
over other species in colonizing new areas, and are those
species capable to adapt to and invade habitats with
dierent salinities than their populations are coming
from.
The successful candidate will conduct molecular ge-
netic study on phylogenetically close species with and
without invasion record native to Northern Europe,
Great Lakes and Ponto-Caspian region whose popu-
lations naturally occur in dierent salinities to deter-
mine historical transitions from marine to brackish and
freshwater habitats and vice versa. He/she will deduce
if evolutionary transition of species to dierent salini-
ties went in both directions (i.e., from marine to fresh-
water and from freshwater to marine habitats). Fi-
nally, he/she will determine if salinity transitions are
more common for species with invasion record than for
species without invasion record, and if they are more
common for Ponto-Caspian than for Northern Europe
or Great Lakes' species.
We are looking for an enthusiastic individual ideally
with experience in molecular ecology, molecular ge-
netic techniques and/or invasion ecology. Any experi-
ence with next generation sequencing is advantageous.
Funding is available for 3 years. The anticipated start-
ing date is 01. October 2014, however, the position
remains open until a suitable candidate is found. Ap-
plicants must hold an MSc/PhD related to biological
sciences, preferentially with a focus on molecular, quan-
titative and/or population genetics. Candidates should
be willing to participate in extensive sampling in the
Northern Europe, Great Lakes and Ponto-Caspian re-
gions, have good organization skills, and be able to work
independently and develop own scientic concepts. Ex-
cellent English communication skills are a prerequisite.
The salary is according to the class 13 TV oD of the
German taris for public employees (65% PhD student;
100% postdoc).

searcher within the recently established Priority Pro-
gram \Flexibility matters: Interplay between trait di-
versity and ecological dynamics using aquatic communi-
ties as model systems" (www.DynaTrait.de) funded by
the German Research Foundation (DFG). We are seek-
ing a highly motivated PhD student with strong inter-
est in community, evolutionary and trait based ecology
to join our interdisciplinary eco-evolutionary research
team located at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre of
Marine Science in Kiel, Germany.
The overarching goal of the project is to assess the
relative importance, and functional interdependencies
of ecological and evolutionary processes within marine
phytoplankton communities under external pressure.The experimental model system will consist of func-
tionally dierent phytoplankton species, i.e. diatoms,
cyanobacteria and coccolithophores that vary in terms
of resource acquisition, productivity and environmen-
tal tolerances. The external forcing will be enhanced
seawater CO2 concentration.
The successful candidate will study the relative impor-
tance of the dierent components of response diversity,
i.e. physiological plasticity, ecological species sorting,
and adaptive evolution, to explain change of ecosys-
tem functioning of selected experimental plankton com-
munities in response to enhanced CO2 concentration.
This will be achieved rst, by a direct experimental
approach, and second, by a theoretical Price-equation
decomposition into plasticity components, ecological
species sorting, and adaptive evolution. Trade-os
among stress tolerance and competitive abilities will
be addressed in order to interpret the results. The
PhD candidate is expected to work in close collabora-
tion with a second PhD candidate studying how rapid
ecological and evolutionary processes inhibit or mutu-
ally enhance each other in multispecies phytoplankton
assemblages.
Funding is available for three years. The anticipated
starting date is 01 December 2014 or January 2015. The
candidate must hold a Master of Science (or equivalent)
degree in the eld of biology, ecology, evolution, or re-
lated subjects. Experiences in experimental ecology or
evolution and in statistical data analysis are required.
The work includes semi-continuous microcosm exper-
iments, microscopic quantication of dierent species
and strains via light and electron microscopy and ow
cytometry, and nutrient analyses. Experience in culti-
vation of phytoplankton is a plus. The candidate should
have a strong interest in multidisciplinary research.
The salary is according to the class 13 TVOD of the
German taris for public employees (65%).

GrenobleU StatisticalGenetics
PhD position in bioinformatics/statistical genetics at
the University of Grenoble (France)
Title: Large-scale statistical methods to study biologi-
cal adaptation with genome wide dataset
The candidate will be involved in a multidisciplinary
research project that concerns a team a mathematical
and computational biology in Grenoble and a team of
human evolutionary genetics at the Institut Pasteur in
Paris. The PhD candidate will work in Grenoble, which
is a French university town located in a beautiful alpine
environment.
Subject: Because of the explosion of large-scale bio-
logical data, statistical research eorts are increasingly
needed in modern biology. The project concerns the
development of statistical methods to study human ge-
netic adaptation. Humans experienced several changes
of their environment, which triggered rapid biological
adaptation. The shift to agriculture was a prominent
modication of their environment. They adopt seden-
tary lifestyles, resulting in increased population densi-
ties and modications of their pathogenic environment
that lead to novel selective pressures. However, the
extent and rapidity of the genetic adaptation to such
novel environments remain largely unknown. Based on
genome wide data (exome sequencing) generated by the
Institut Pasteur in Paris, we will investigate the occur-
rence of rapid adaptation through various evolutionary
mechanisms.
The candidate will develop original statistical ap-
proaches to detect the regions of the genomes that have
been involved in genetic adaptation. Statistical models
will be based on machine learning approaches that areparticularly well suited to handle large-scale genomic
data. Numerical implementations of the proposed ap-
proaches will be compared based on simulations that
mimic evolutionary processes of biological adaptation.
Prole: The background of the candidate can be in
statistics or bioinformatics. Students from related dis-
ciplines, such as physics, computer science, mathemat-
ics or computational biology are also welcome to apply.
Applicants with a genuine interest for interdisciplinary
PhD education will be preferred.
Applicants should send by email a CV and a recom-
mendation letter from an academic reference.

We are looking to recruit a student interested in study-
ing the evolution and genomics of a Hawaiian plant gall
radiation.16 EvolDir September 1, 2014
Despite the economic importance of galling (many
plant pests are gallers) very little is known about the
molecular developmental processes underlying galling.
This project will use the recently proposed and inno-
vative approach of \evolutionary developmental tran-
scriptomics". Further, the project will use a novel ap-
plication of \dual-RNAseq" to co-generate plant and
insect transcriptomes under gall interaction.
The project is in two parts: (i) the ecological and de-
velopmental characterization of gall biology in a insect-
plant island radiation. This will involve eldwork in the
Hawaiian Islands. (ii) Genomic approaches to identify
the genes, regulatory networks, and expression patterns
involved in shifts to dierent gall phenotypes among
closely related insect species. The project will use whole
genome sequencing and de novo assembly of the plant
and insect genomes (guided by reference genomes of
Eucalyptus and Diaphorina/Trioza), together with leaf
(infected and uninfected) and nymph transcriptomics
to identify candidate genes associated with the pertur-
bation of plant tissue during gall formation. Bioinfor-
matics will include construction of gene coexpression
networks to predict plant and insect gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) and gene network modules (GNMs)
using galled and ungalled leaves. Our approach will
draw on recent developmental work on leaf shape us-
ing the generation of self-organizing maps (SOMs) and
gene coexpression network analysis to describe GNM
rewiring between evolutionary-developmental states.
The PhD student will gain knowledge across a broad
range of areas from eldwork, lab work, systematics, ge-
nomics and evolution of development. Training will be
in plant and insect genomics and development, candi-
date gene identication and Bayesian modelling meth-
ods, RNA and DNA collection and extraction, next gen-
eration sequencing methods, genomic assemblies and
bioinformatics methods, and insect and plant biology.
For further details contact Dr Diana Percy
(d.percy@nhm.ac.uk)
Interested parties will need to provide: - Curriculum vi-
tae. - Covering letter outlining your interest in the par-
ticular PhD project, relevant skills training, experience
and qualications for research, and a statement of how
this PhD project ts your career development plans. -

Doctoral Research Fellowship in Evolutionary Ge-
nomics/Behavioural Ecology
A 4-year PhD position is available at the Natural His-
tory Museum (NHM), University of Oslo (UiO). The
PhD project is part of a larger research program on
'Sperm-pathogen interactions and the evolution of ejac-
ulate antimicrobial defences in passerine birds'.
Animals are constantly exposed to pathogens, and the
ability of individuals to combat microbial attack is an
important component of tness. Sperm cells are not
immune to microbial exposure, and bacteria can cause
reductions in sperm quality and compromise male fertil-
ity. Moreover, ejaculate-borne pathogens can be trans-
ferred during mating (i.e. STDs), with negative conse-
quences for female fertility. Thus, ejaculate-borne bac-
teria are predicted to generate intense selection for the
evolution of antibacterial substances in seminal uid.
This project integrates organismal and molecular ap-
proaches to develop an understanding of the role of bac-
teria in the evolution of avian seminal uid and factors
that minimise bacterial-induced sperm defects and limit
the transmission of STDs. The successful candidate will
be allowed to focus on either the evolutionary genomics
or the behavioural ecology aspects of the larger study
(or some combination of these two) as best ts her/his
skills and research interests. She/he will also be encour-
aged to develop additional, complementary avenues of
research.
Interested candidates should have a good degree in a
relevant subject, such as background in evolutionary bi-
ology or behavioural ecology. In addition, an interest in
evolutionary genomics and previous eldwork and bird
handling experience would be advantageous. The posi-
tion is aliated with the Sex and Evolution Research
Group (SERG) at the Natural History Museum (NHM)
and the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Syn-
thesis (CEES), and may also include a period of time
based in the laboratory of Dr Steve Dorus (Syracuse
University, USA). The research team will also include
scientists from the USA and Germany. The working
language will be English. Fieldwork may be conducted
at a variety of locations, including Norway and Italy.

SwanseaU HelicobacterGenomics
Swansea, UK; Helicobacter pylori Genomics
Helicobacter pylori cancer genomics, fully-funded PhD
studentship available in the Sheppard laboratory (2014-
2017).
H. pylori infection is the principal pathophysiological
step leading to initiation of the inammatory response
in gastric cancer patients. However, the severity of dis-
ease and the ultimate outcome is dependent upon a
complex interaction between pathogen and host cell.
Chronic inammation is understood to induce cancer
by increasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and
subsequent DNA damage. This could result from infec-
tion with any H. pylori strain, however, H. pylori popu-
lations are highly structured with numerous genotypes
existing together in a single patient and these strains
can have dierent disease causing potential. By charac-
terizing variation in the core and accessory genome we
will identify candidate associated genetic elements (alle-
les, SNPs) that are over represented in isolates from pa-
tients with certain types of cellular pathologies. These
will be investigated in functional studies to improve un-
derstanding of disease causation.
The successful applicant will join a multidisciplinary
group focusing on population biology and evolution of
bacterial pathogens of public health importance. Com-
parative genomics and functional characterisation ap-
proaches will examine the genetic structuring within
pathogenic populations and answer fundamental ques-
tions about how genetic variation and genome plasticity
inuence adaptation and the evolution of pathogenic-
ity. They will be responsible for sampling and cultur-
ing isolates, extracting DNA for genetic characterisa-
tion, analysing genomic data and carrying molecular
and functional characterisation in the lab. Experimen-
tal approaches will provide training in CL2 containment
techniques, in vitro mammalian cell culture, RT-qPCR
and INCell Analyzer techniques. Bioinformatics train-
ing will involve state-of-the-art analysis of hundreds
of whole genome sequences. This project will involve
working within the MRC CLIMB consortium, directed
by Dr Samuel Sheppard (http://www.climb.ac.uk),
and the Sheppard (http://www.sheppardlab.com) and
Jenkins (http://www.swansea.ac.uk/sta/medicine/-
research/jenkinsgjs) laboratories.
Academic requirements:Candidates should have a 1st or 2:1 class honours de-
gree in a relevant subject (genetics, microbiology, bioin-
formatics, molecular biology, or ecology). The success-
ful candidate will be highly motivated, creative, in-
dependent and ideally have previous experience in a
molecular biology laboratory or in bioinformatics re-
search. Enthusiasm and practical experience in mi-
crobiology, molecular techniques (PCR, sequencing)
and computer based genetic analysis are desirable, but

these areas. Good English writing and oral skills are
essential.

Llamas and Prof Alan Cooper. This project will use
a novel experimental system to explore the potentially
important role of epigenetics in long-term evolution and
how animals adapt to rapid climate change. Bones
of ancient bison and cattle preserved in permafrost or
caves will be analysed for epigenetic markers using ad-
vanced Next Generation Sequencing approaches, and
the patterns contrasted over a 30,000-year record of
major climatic and environmental shifts. It has strong
potential to reveal key loci for climate adaptation in
modern cattle. Most previous genetic research has been
blind to epigenetic marks, and this study promises to
be a major advance in addressing this issue, with con-
siderable implications for conservation genetics and the
cattle industry.
2) Using phylogenomics to record the impacts of cli-
mate change, extinction and population fragmentation
(Australian Research Council grant DP140104233). Su-
pervision: Dr Julien Soubrier and Prof Alan Cooper.
We will use ancient DNA from permafrost-preserved
Steppe bison bones and bovid exome capture systems
to build a detailed record of the genomic impacts of
rapid climate and environmental change at the end of
the Pleistocene (30-11 kyr). The project will analyse
how ancestral genetic diversity is distributed amongst
surviving bison populations, and the role of nuclear loci
under selection and drift. It will create a novel temporal
dataset of genomic adaptation and evolution, and will
generate critical data for studies of evolutionary pro-
cesses such as extinctions, speciation and conservation
biology and management.

PhD position in Evolution and Ecology
Pay grade 13 TV oD (65% of standard working hours),
18 + 18 months xed-term contract
start date: as soon as possible
Job description: Alongside sexual reproduction and
multicellularity, eusociality is considered one of the ma-
jor transitions in evolution. Outside of Hymenoptera,
advanced eusociality has evolved in one other major in-
sect group: the termites. A fundamental trait shared
between termites and hymenopteran societies is social
immunity, but its evolution and mechanistic basis re-
mains poorly understood. This project aims to use
state-of-the-art molecular methods within a compara-
tive experimental framework to address the evolution
and ecology of socially mediated immunity in termites.
The project will focus on understanding the role of so-
ciality in host-parasite interactions. In particular, the
candidate will apply life-history theory to understand
how behavioural and physiological host responses vary
across species, and how ecology and caste shape indi-
vidual and social immunity.
Position description: We are seeking an ambitious per-
son to contribute to the development of a new research
group in evolution and ecology of insects. Our focus
is on fundamental questions in host-parasite dynamics,
but applied elements (e.g. pest control) may also be
possible within this framework. The selected candidate
will have opportunities to attend taught courses at the
Free University of Berlin. The successful candidate will
register for a PhD at Free University of Berlin and will
need to meet the language requirements for a research
degree.
Prole requirements: The candidate should have a good
Masters degree in Biology covering basic knowledge in
evolution and ecology. Experience or interest in eco-
logical aspects and studies of symbiotic or parasitic in-
teractions are important criteria in selecting the can-
didate. A requirement is a willingness to work in an
interdisciplinary and international environment. Very
good knowledge in English is necessary; and knowledge
of German is an advantage.

MicrobialSymbiosisGenomics
The Burke lab in the Entomology department at the
University of Georgia is recruiting PhD students for
the Spring semester of 2015.
Research in the lab focuses upon symbiotic relation-
ships between microbes and animals, and uses func-
tional and evolutionary genetics and genomics to ex-
amine how these kinds of relationships can occur and
are maintained. In particular, we study the fascinating
benecial viruses that are harbored by parasitic wasps.
Graduate students in the lab will generally work on the
molecular genetics and genomics of microbial symbionts
of animals and are encouraged to consider projects in-
volving viral associations with parasitic wasps or other
insects.
Graduate students accepted into the Entomology pro-
gram are guaranteed nancial support for their 5-year22 EvolDir September 1, 2014
program through Teaching Assistantships (TAs) or Re-
search Assistantships (RAs), which includes an out-of-
state tuition waiver. Additional funding exists for grad-
uate student research and travel to scientic meetings.
Interested students are also strongly encouraged to ap-
ply for graduate research fellowships, such as the Na-
tional Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow-
ship. Importantly, students are eligible to apply for this
and other fellowships in their nal year as undergradu-
ates. Please refer to the Burke lab website for detailed
information about nancial support and the University
of Georgia graduate program in Entomology.
The University of Georgia is a Tier I research university
located in Athens, Georgia. The University of Georgia
Entomology department has strong representation of
faculty studying host/parasite relationships and vector
biology, creating a collaborative environment in which
students can benet from interaction with other fac-
ulty and students. The Burke lab has been recently
renovated and is well-equipped for molecular biology
and genomics research. Athens is a city of 100,000 lo-
cated in the Piedmont basin south of the Appalachian
mountains in a green and leafy environment. The city
not only has a terric music scene, great restaurants,
nearby mountains for hiking, art, cultural and sports
events, etc., but it also has a very low cost of living
index compared to many other places in the United
States. Athens is conveniently located 90 minutes to
the east of Atlanta, a major city with the largest air-
port in the US.
Interested candidates should contact Gaelen Burke at
grburke@uga.edu with a description of your 1) aca-
demic background, 2) research experience, 3) your gen-
eral and specic interests in research in the Burke lab
at the University of Georgia and 4) contact informa-
tion for three references. Please also attach your cur-
rent resume or Curriculum Vitae. Students must have
a greater than 3.0 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) and must have
taken the general GRE exam.

AvianClimateChangeEvolutionMasters project climate change ecology 30-50 ECTS
Starting September 2014
Supervisors: Jelmer Samplonius MSc, Prof. Dr. Ir.
Christiaan Both
We are looking for 2 motivated Europe based MSc stu-
dents that have anity with climate change ecology
Project 1: does trophic mismatch cause mistimed avian
reproduction? One of the major ecological conse-
quences of climate change is that phenological shifts
are unequal across interdependent trophic levels. A key
example in the literature is the great tit that has ad-
vanced its breeding date less than the peak date of one
of its supposed main prey species: the caterpillars of the
winter moth. As caterpillar peak dates have advanced
twice as fast as great tit hatching dates, nestlings now
grow up under worse conditions. However, key corner-
stones to support this hypothesis are still lacking:
1) evidence that birds largely rely on winter moth cater-
pillars, and 2) experimental evidence that birds suer
from food limitation due to their reproductive timing.
In spring 2014 we have performed a eld experiment
in which the hatch date of great tits was manipulated,
and prey choice was monitored with nest box cameras.
From a quick glance at the pictures I can already lift
a tip of the veil: the trophic mismatch hypothesis ap-
pears to oversimplify the adaptive capacity of birds.
The main task in this MSc project will be to quantify
(from pictures) which prey items great tit parents bring
to their nest depending on their seasonal timing. This
will also be compared to components of tness.
Project 2: does climate change alter competitive inter-
actions between resident and migrant passerines? Cli-
mate change can alter competitive interactions between
resident and migrant birds by altering the overlap of
their reproductive timing. Long distance migrants have
little exibility in adjusting their breeding time to year-
to-year changes in temperature, and likely change grad-
ually through a micro-evolutionary response. In con-
trast, residents can anticipate better, and thereby rely
on phenotypic exibility. In the increasingly warmer
springs we thus expect less overlap in timing of breed-
ing, and potentially a release in interspecic compe-
tition for food. In 2014, we experimentally created
patches with more and less overlap in breeding dates be-
tween resident tits and migratory ycatchers, to study
whether prey choice and tness are aected.
Your main task will be to quantify (from pictures)
which prey items are caught by long distant migrant
pied ycatchers depending on which competitive envi-
ronment with resident great tits they breed in. This
data will also be compared to components of tness.September 1, 2014 EvolDir 23
The candidate should have a BSc degree in Biology and
started a masters programme in Biology (Ecology, Zo-
ology, Evolution, Conservation, Systematics) at a Euro-
pean University. The successful candidate is awarded
European Credit Points for their project. The Euro-
pean Credit Transfer System (ECTS) allows you to
transfer your points between universities. There will
be no nancial compensation (although your university
or Erasmus may provide you with a scholarship for an
international project)

How readily do resistance traits to climatic extremes
evolve? -The goal of this project is to investigate the
rates of adaptation of traits associated with living at
low or high elevations. The research will involve sam-
pling plants in the Alps, assessing climate-stress re-
sistance traits under common garden conditions, and
conducting phylogenetic comparative analysis of these
traits. The candidate should have an eager interest
in plants and their evolution, a strong background in
quantitative thinking, experimental design, statistical
analysis, and enthusiasm for eldwork in the high Alps.
The project is a collaboration with the University of

versity and species interactions of plantation and wild
Macadamia Lacebugs. These results will provide the
Macadamia industry a basis for designing an integrated
pest management program and a sustainable future.
We are looking for PhD candidates with solid molecular
genetic experience; experience in eldwork and/or en-
tomology is an advantage. For suitable students, there
is the possibility of giving a supplement of up to $8000
AUD pa on top of standard UNSW PhD scholarship
rates, to make a total scholarship of up to $33000 AUD
pa.
PROCEDURE (1) DISCUSS: Email letter with CV,

UQueensland MicrobialAdaptation
Two PhD projects are available in the group of Dr. Jan
Engelst adter at The University of Queensland (Bris-
bane, Australia). These projects aim at gaining a better
understanding of how recombination aects adaptation
in microbial populations.
The rst project is theoretical and will involve devel-
oping mathematical models and computer simulations
that investigate the role of various ecological and pop-
ulation genetic factors in bringing about an advantage
of recombination during microbial adaptation. For this
position, strong quantitative skills and a background
in either evolutionary genetics or mathematical mod-
elling are required. Candidates with both biology and
non-biology degrees (mathematics, physics, computer
science) are encouraged to apply.
The second project takes an experimental evolution ap-
proach. Here, bacteria recombining through either plas-
mids or natural transformation are adapted to dierent
environmental conditions and the selective response is
then dissected at the phenotypic and genomic level. For
this position, a strong background in either evolution-
ary biology or microbiology is required.
For both positions, good communication skills, sci-
entic curiosity and enthusiasm for research in evo-
lutionary biology are essential. For more details
about our research and recent publications, see http:/-

in these positions are expected to be eligible for APA
scholarships. For overseas students, funding can be ob-
tained through competitive international PhD scholar-
ship schemes at UQ. For more information about these
schemes and formal requirements for PhD students as
well as about the School of Biological Sciences at UQ,

Interested candidates should send a cover letter describ-
ing their motivation and research interests, CV, copy
of degrees, and contact information for two academic
references to: j.engelstaedter@uq.edu.au. Applications
close on 31 August 2014.
Qualications Applicants require a Bachelor's degree
with Honours, Master of Science, MPhil or equivalent
degrees. Australian and New Zealand applicants must

SpeciationGenomics
Graduate position: U.Southampton/NHM London SpeciationGenomics
Mark Chapman (Centre for Biological Sciences, Univer-
sity of Southampton) and Mark Carine (Department of
Life Sciences, Natural History Museum) are looking for
a PhD student to study speciation genomics in a group
of Macaronesian plants.
The evolutionary outcomes of hybridisation can range
from being of little consequence to the origin of entirely
new species. In some cases, hybridisation is rare, but if
the hybrids exhibit adaptation to a novel habitat they
can be maintained as a new species. These scenarios are
ideal for understanding the intersection between adap-
tation, migration, hybridisation and speciation.
Of particular value to these studies is using Next Gen-
eration Sequencing (NGS) to assay the expressed por-
tion of the genome (the transcriptome), simultaneously
providing gene expression and sequence polymorphism
data for thousands of genes. Firstly, this allows detec-
tion of dierentially expressed loci that underlie adap-
tive divergence between dierentially adapted or inde-
pendently evolved taxa. Secondly, the genetic signa-
tures of sequence-based adaptive divergence can be in-
vestigated by assaying polymorphism and divergence
between species, identifying loci with non-neutral pat-
terns of sequence polymorphism. In the past, such anal-
yses were only possible for model organisms; however
one can now study non-model organisms, in prime eco-
logical and evolutionary scenarios, to investigate the
genetic control of these phenomena.
Isolated oceanic archipelagos are natural laboratories of
evolution, ideally suited for in situ studies of speciation.
The volcanic oceanic archipelagos of Macaronesia (the
Azores, Madeira, Canaries and Cape Verde Islands) are
a notable example, demonstrating a high degree of en-
demism, and spectacular examples of evolutionary radi-
ations with geographic isolation, habitat shifts and hy-
bridisation all contributing to the rapid diversication
of endemic lineages. The endemic genus Argyranthe-
mum (Compositae) provides an excellent example of a
Macaronesian radiation, comprising twenty-four species
that have evolved following a single colonisation of the
region. As with many Macaronesian endemic lineages,September 1, 2014 EvolDir 29
phylogenetic relationships are not fully resolved and
hence any eorts to study speciation processes will re-
quire an accurate phylogenetic and population genetic
understanding of the species involved. Argyranthemum
also provides a rare, well-documented case of homoploid
hybrid speciation with the hybrid species A. sundingii
derived on multiple occasions from A. frutescens and
A. broussonetii. This makes Argyranthemum an ideal
biological scenario to understand multiple evolutionary
phenomena in concert.

SexualSelectionSociality
Can sexual selection drive social evolution? Insights
from male dragons.
While we know that access to mate can lead to the evo-
lution of male coalition and alliances, our understand-
ing of the extent sexual selection can shape social rela-
tionships is still unclear. Systems which exhibit alterna-
tive mating strategies oer great opportunities to gain
greater insights into the ways by which diering mating
strategies may inuences patterns of social interactions
and environment. This phd project will utilize the east-
ern water dragon (Intellagama lesueurii ) as a study sys-
tem to investigate the extent to which sexual selection
can shape social relationships. The project will combine
the elds of genetics and behavioural ecology. Eastern
water dragon is a large social, semi-aquatic and arboreal
agamid lizard (Agamidae), native to Australia. Eastern
water dragons exhibit elaborate social behaviours and
a harem like mating system with males engaging in rit-
ualised combat during the mating season (spring to late
summer). Two types of male mating tactics have been
described to date; males either exhibit strong territorial
or non-territorial satellite behaviour.The study site is found within the Roma Street Park-
land (RSP) (27 27' 46\ S, 153 1' 11" E) located in
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. RSP is a 16 hectare
park and is the world's largest subtropical garden in
a city centre. It is also host to a large population
of Eastern water dragons with a population size esti-
mated to exceed 600 animals (Gardnier et al. PloS
ONE doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096992). Ecological,
behavioural surveys have been conducted on this popu-
lation since October 2010 with morphological and DNA
samples collected from more than 350 animals.
Applicants will need to have an extremely competitive
academic record and obtain an Australian Postgradu-
ate Award or International Research and Fee Remis-
sion Scholarships (for details and scholarship applica-
tion forms http://www.usc.edu.au/research/research-
students/hdr-scholarships). Scholarship round is open
now and will close by October 4th. I would expect
international applicants to hold a master and have at
least one publication. Australian applicants will require
a rst class honours degree.

WageningenU FungalDomestication
Re-domesticating an ancient domesticated fungus
A 4-year PhD position is available in my lab at Wa-
geningen University in The Netherlands, starting fall
2015. This NWO funded project will study adaptations
of the Termitomyces fungi cultivated by fungus-growing
termites to a symbiotic lifestyle. The work will use in
vitro microbial techniques to study life-history traits
(mycelial growth and asexual spore production and de-
tails of enzyme production) of Termitomyces strains,
followed by genetic analyses. We have a collection of30 EvolDir September 1, 2014
more than 100 Termitomyces strains, associated with
the three most common genera of fungus-growing ter-
mites and recently the genome of one strain has been
sequenced. The primary goal of this project is to gain
fundamental insight in functional aspects of coevolution
and mutualistic symbiosis. Ultimately, this knowledge
may be used for the artical cultivation of the highly
valued mushrooms formed by Termitomyces. Attempts
to cultivate this fungus have been unsuccessful, because
essential knowledge of the mutualistic relationship with
termites is still lacking.
Summary
Knowledge of division of labour between interacting
species is required to understand their interdependence
in mutualistic relationships, but also to be able to grow
mutualistic species in isolation. This second aspect is
of applied interest to cultivate organisms that already
have been domesticated by other species. Examples
of 're-domestication' exist in nature, but humans have
not employed this approach yet. A promising possi-
bility for re-domestication is provided by the obligate
mutualistic symbiosis between termites and Termito-
myces fungi. The mushrooms formed by Termitomyces
are the most protein-rich mushrooms known, and highly
appreciated as a wild food source in many African coun-
tries. Unfortunately, attempts to cultivate this fungus
have been unsuccessful, because essential knowledge of
the mutualistic relationship with termites was lacking
until recently. The objectives of this proposal are i)
to establish division of labour in substrate degradation
between termites and Termitomyces; ii) to establish
variation in the growth requirements between Termit-
omyces strains, and, iii) to establish the factors that
initiate mushroom formation. We will use the recently
sequenced genome of Termitomyces for in-depth anal-
ysis of the genes expressed during dierent stages of
the fungal life cycle, screen our culture collection on a
standard set of 35 carbon sources and select strains for
further research. The fundamental knowledge gained
in this project on the evolution of division of labour in
mutualisms will go hand-in-hand with the knowledge
required for articial cultivation of Termitomyces by
humans.

Scientic%20Sta/Duur+Aanen Wageningen Univer-
sity and Research centre (Wageningen UR) is a leading
international organization. Within the eld of healthy
nutrition and living environment we are working on the
quality of life. We are always looking for talented col-
leagues. Professionals with passion who want to work
with us for the world of tomorrow.
The interrelationship between genetics, heredity and
evolution is the focus of research of the Laboratory of
Genetics (LoG). Central is the study of genetic varia-
tion that ranges from the processes that produce it (mu-
tation, recombination), to the factors that have shaped
its architecture in the past, and to the factors and pro-
cesses that determine its fate. Our current research
focus can be captured in the following three themes,
(1) Generating variation; (2) Genetics and levels of se-
lection, and (3) Genetics of adaptations. Within these
themes we can retain and expand on our national and
international reputation as a key research group with
a unique focus on fundamental and applied aspects of
genetics and heredity.
Because evolutionary theory applies to all life forms,
and heredity is a key characteristic of life, the ge-
netic and evolutionary analysis of biodiversity requires
a broad range of model species that span the ma-
jor kingdoms. Therefore, the LoG uses prokaryotes
(bacteria) and eukaryotes from yeast, fungi, to ani-
mals (Drosophila melanogaster) and plants (Arabidop-
sis thaliana). All our systems are characterized by the
ease of laboratory rearing and by the availability of a
plethora of genetic and phenotypic tools for experimen-
tal manipulation.
Our strength is that we study both fundamental mech-
anism of genetics as well as the more inclusive mecha-
nisms of heredity (e.g. cytogenetics, epigenetics, regu-
lation of gene expression) and how this inuences

with multiple PCR rooms, automated sequencers, real-
time PCR machines, etc), and a next-gen sequencing
platform. Research projects are performed at a global
scale. The Northern region of Portugal provides rich
cultural and outdoor activities and Porto is a world-

We are now advertising a 1 year research contract
funded by an FP7 CAPACITIES program (FP7-
REGPOT-CT-2011-286431-CIBIO-New-gen) and ex-
pect to recruit an enthusiastic and highly motivated
researcher in the area of Human Evolutionary Genet-
ics.
The Human and Evolutionary Research Groups inter-
ests cover dierent research topics related to the evolu-
tionary history of human genes and populations, using
genome-wide sequencing and SNP data. A strong focus
will be devoted to the demographic history of African
populations, in particular to southern Angolan groups
that are pivotal to understand the peopling of South-
ern Africa. A particular emphasis will be given to the
analysis of spatial patterns of genetic variation. As anadditional topic, the work on Southern Angola will in-
clude the analysis of the genetic diversity of cattle and
sheep breeds held by peoples relying on farming and
herding to dierent extents.
The candidate is expected to have an interdisciplinary
attitude, rather oriented towards data analysis than to
data generation. Accordingly, s/he will have a sound
knowledge of population genetics theory and master dif-
ferent kinds of data analysis software currently available
to interpret human population genetic data. Additional
computer programing skills will be considered an ad-
vantage. Applicants should have a PhD degree, and
a good publication record in SCI journals. Fluency in
English speaking and writing is required. As the can-
didate will be invited to participate in teaching at the
MSc and PhD levels, teaching experience will be con-
sidered valuable. The selected candidate is expected
to establish solid collaborations and be able to attract
national and international funding.
Salary corresponds approximately to a gross annual in-
come of 45000 euros (before taxes). The selected can-
didate is expected to start in October 1, 2014. Ending
date is September 30, 2015. Another contract maybe
oered depending on performance and availability of
funds.
Applications should be sent to diretor@cibio.up.pt and
include a detailed CV, a letter of motivation and re-
search interests, and the contact of 3 referees. Candi-
dates with outstanding curricula will be invited for a
Skype interview.
Applications will be open until September 15, 2014, but
will be reviewed at an on-going basis until the position
is lled. There is no obligation to hire any of the can-
didates. CIBIO has an equal opportunity policy. We
aim to ensure that no applicant receives less favorable
consideration on the grounds of gender, marital status,
race, age, color, nationality, ethnic origin or religious
belief.

newsdetail.asp?id06 Functional studies of animal be-
haviour traditionally ignore the psychological and phys-
iological mechanisms involved. Yet often, mechanis-
tic details can crucially aect the behaviour we ob-
serve. For a more complete understanding of animal be-
haviour, we need to study the adaptive value of the un-
derlying mechanisms and the constraints on their evo-
lution. This special issue of Current Zoology will show-
case an emerging line of research that directly addresses
the evolution of behavioural mechanisms. How do an-
imals reach adaptive solutions? What information-
processing rules do they use? Why is behaviour some-
times irrational? Why are cognitive systems biased?How do animals deal with uncertainty? When is ex-
ible behaviour favoured over rigid behaviour? These
questions are central to understanding how selection
shapes behaviour. The special issue will cover theo-
retical and empirical research, integrate functional and
mechanistic approaches, and draw on insights from a
range of sub-disciplines to oer a diversity of perspec-
tives on animal behaviour.

Dear EvolDir Community,
We are pleased to announce the RNA-seqlopedia:
http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/ The RNA-seqlopedia is
meant as a resource for researchers trying to utilize
RNA-seq protocols for their research, including de novo
assembly of transcriptomes as well as quantication of
gene expression. The site focuses on multiple aspects of
RNA-seq work including experimental design, molecu-
lar protocols, and bioinformatic analyses.
We realize that the site does not yet cover all aspects of
transcriptomic analysis, and undoubtedly contains er-
rors or dated information that will be modied. We will
continue to update the site and add to its content, par-
ticularly via input from the scientic community, so we
request your input! We hope that the RNA-seqlopedia
will prove to be a useful research resource for those in-
terested in transcriptomic analyses using second (and
third) generation sequencing.
The site was made possible by a grant from the NIH
National Center for Research Resources, and is being
created and maintained by the Cresko Lab at the Uni-

Software TreeVisualization
Scalable visualization of phylogenies and 2D/3D image68 EvolDir September 1, 2014
collections
I have released a new program, \Ceiba" (vers. 1.05),
for visualization and navigation of a large phylogenetic
tree, and (optionally) annotation of that tree with col-
lections of images. It has been tested on trees with
55,000 leaves and the same number of images. Im-
ages can be either 2D digital photographs or 3D sur-
face models such as those obtained from CT scans of
biological specimens. Ceiba is not a program for build-
ing phylogenies or analyzing comparative data. It is
a program for tree visualization, exploration, and edu-
cation. It provides interactive 3D and 2D tree layouts
in a hierarchical display meant to ease navigation in a
potentially very large and complex tree. Some features
are aimed at researchers interested in quickly navigat-
ing across a phylogenetic tree and interacting with its
annotations; others are tailored to more naive users in-
teracting with the tree in an educational setting, such
as an outreach exhibit.
The program reads Nexus and Newick formatted trees,
and can take as input a phylogenetic classication
scheme the user may provide to annotate major clades
in the tree. A manual, data sets, source code (dis-
tributed under a GPL license) and binaries for OS X
are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ceiba.
It has also been compiled successfully on Linux plat-
forms. A brief paper describing the program is available

US pathogen experiments concern
I am writing to ask for the support of evolutionary bi-
ologists on an issue that lies at the intersection of *evo-
lutionary biology, biosafety, and infectious diseases*,
which has become more salient after recent incidents
involving dangerous pathogens { u, anthrax and small-
pox { in federal labs in the US. The issue is the grow-
ing experimental eort to create { mainly through se-
lection of during passage experiments { novel strains
of inuenza that are transmissible in ferrets, the lead-
ing animal model for human u infection. A group of
scientists and other concerned experts is calling for aSeptember 1, 2014 EvolDir 69
curtailment of such experiments until a serious, quanti-
tative, disinterested risk assessment has been performed
to ask whether these experiments oer unique benets,
unattainable by safer means, that justify their unique
risks. We have called for an Asilomar-like meeting to
start such a process, which would include all points of
view under a neutral sponsorship.
These experiments create pathogens which, should an
accidental human infection occur, have the potential to
spread widely and, in the worst case, lead to an un-
controlled pandemic. Recent events in federal labs in
the US show that even in the leading laboratories, hu-
man error leads to the risk of human exposure. This is
not an unusual occurrence; in the period 2004-10 there
were two loss or release events PER WEEK <http://-
www.absa.org/abj/abj/121704FAHenkel.pdf >in bio-
containment labs in the US involving Select Agents.
While the probability of such incidents in any given lab
in a year can be estimated from available data, these
new \gain of function" experiments that deliberately
enhance transmissibility of inuenza viruses present or-
ders of magnitude greater risk than anthrax or wild-
type, poorly contagious avian u strains, because of the
risk of transmission. *This is an issue of population bi-
ology, because the consequences of accident in such an
experiment are to the population through transmission,
not only to the individual researcher.*
*I am writing you to invite you to join the CambridgeWorking Group, www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org, by
supporting our statement that these experiments
should be curtailed until there is a serious, quantita-
tive, risk-benet analysis of what benets are uniquely
obtainable by this exceptionally risky class of experi-
ments, and whether these unique benets justify the
risks involved. Note that we are not calling for a halt
to work on dangerous pathogens in general; our call fo-
cuses on the creation of novel, transmissible dangerous
pathogens, one of many techniques available for study-
ing such organisms but a uniquely dangerous one.*
*The website < http://-
www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org/ >has a link
for you to add your support to that of a growing
number of scientists and others, as well as several
pages of links to relevant articles, press coverage and
the like. A recent op-ed I wrote on the topic is here

Edinburgh HostPathogenEvolEcol
Post Doctoral Research Associate in host-pathogen evo-
lutionary ecology
Vacancy Ref: : 031106 Closing Date : 22-Sep-2014
The Vale Lab at the University of Edinburgh is
looking to recruit a Post-doctoral Research Associate
(PDRA). The Vale lab is closely aliated with the
Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution (http://-
ciie.bio.ed.ac.uk/) and works on the evolutionary ecol-
ogy of infectious disease, focusing on the fruit y
Drosophila as model host of viral infection. The post-
doctoral position will be funded by a Society in Science
- Branco Weiss grant to investigate how individual vari-
ation in resistance and tolerance may inuence disease
spread and pathogen evolution.
The specic focus of the project is exible according
to the interests of the successful candidate, but should
ideally address the genetic basis of variation in host
tolerance to viral infection, or the consequences of this
variation for disease transmission and viral evolution.
This project will take advantage of the vast resources
oered by Drosophila as a model system for the evolu-
tionary ecology and genetics of host-pathogen interac-
tions. Specically, key infection phenotypes pertaining
to resistance and tolerance will be measured on lines
derived from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel
(DGRP). The fully sequenced genomes of these lines al-
low high resolution mapping of phenotypes to genome-
wide SNP data. The emphasis in the lab is to achieve a
multifaceted view of host health, complimenting tradi-
tional measures such as host survival with more subtle
but equally important measures of host morbidity such
as fecundity, activity and sleep cycles, feeding rate, or
foraging and courtship behaviours. Depending on the
candidate's interests and skills, there is therefore scope
to focus on host life-history, physiological health, or
sickness behaviours under infection. We therefore wel-
come applications from candidates with a wide rangeof interests.
We are looking for someone who is self-driven and look-
ing to work independently within a small but dynamic
group. Candidates should have or should shortly ob-
tain a PhD with a strong background in host-pathogen
interactions, evolutionary ecology, evolutionary genet-
ics, or similar eld, with the demonstrated ability to
publish in peer-reviewed journals. The ideal candidate
should have previous experience in designing and ex-
ecuting large experiments with Drosophila, or other
invertebrates. Experience with molecular techniques
(RNA extraction, PCR, qPCR, cell culture) would be
particularly advantageous, as these skills are central to
the project.
The position is initially available for 24 months, with
the possibility of extension. The starting date is exi-
ble, but early (Jan/Feb) 2015 is preferred.
Informal inquiries can be made directly to Dr. Pedro
Vale (pedro.vale@ed.ac.uk), but full applications must
be made by following the link to the University of Ed-
inburgh's recruitment website (or searching the for va-
cancy Ref 031106):

R. Levin, PI Experimental studies of the population
and evolutionary biology of bacteria, antibiotic treat-
ment and antibiotic resistance
Approximately half the time of the successful candi-
date for this position will be devoted to ongoing exper-
imental studies of the pharmacodynamics of antibiotics
and bacteria and the population and evolutionary dy-
namics of antibiotic treatment and resistance. These
experiments will be performed in vitro (in plastico)
with both planktonic and physically structured popu-
lations of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aerug-
inosa, Streptococcus pneumonia, and E. coli with sin-
gle and pairs of antibiotics of dierent classes. The
general goal of these experimental and the associated
mathematical modeling studies is to improve the e-
cacy of antibiotic treatment protocols to clear bacterial
infections whilst minimizing the likelihood of resistance
emerging during the course of therapy. Of particular in-
terest is to develop single and two-drug dosing regimes
to treat infections with bacteria that are moderately
non-susceptible (politically correct for resistant) to the
treating antibiotic(s).
The other half of the time of the successful candidate
will be devoted to independent studies of their own de-
sign on related projects of the population and evolu-
tionary biology of bacteria and their viruses, plasmids
and other accessory genetic elements.
Preference will be given to candidates that are passion-
ate (fanatical) about research and of one of two ilks and
experience: (1) Microbiologists and microbial molecular
geneticists with an interest in and aptitude for quanti-
tative studies of the population and evolutionary dy-
namics of bacteria. (2) Population and evolutionary
biologists and geneticists with the extreme wisdom and
good taste to work with (or want to work with) bacte-
ria.
In addition to the usual CV and statement of research
interest and accomplishments, CANDIDATES WILL
ONLY BE CONSIDERED IF THEY INCLUDE, (i)
a cover letter indicating why and how this laboratory
and these project ts into their career goals and aspi-

Postdoctoral position in Systematics and Evolution
A two-year postdoctoral position in Systematics and
Evolution is available in the Department of Zoology,
Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm.
Project description \Species-level phylogeny and delim-
itation in a biodiversity hotspot"76 EvolDir September 1, 2014
Madagascar is well known for its high level of en-
demism, basically across every organism group. The
combination with severe habitat degradation has \re-
warded" the island with a top placement among biodi-
versity hotspots. The increased evolutionary research
interest last twenty years has focused on vertebrates
and surprisingly little is yet known about the coloniza-
tion and speciation history of most insect groups. Using
Hydradephagan water beetles as model organisms this
project will use dated phylogenetic frameworks to an-
alyze colonization and speciation patterns across repli-
cated endemic radiations and clades with representa-
tives but seemingly without radiations. Intraspecic
genetic variation will be sampled to estimate parame-
ters in the multispecies coalescent model as a window
into the speciation process. The project also includes
evaluation of species delimitation methods on endemic
radiations with non-reciprocally monophyletic species
in gene-trees.
Tasks The position is part of a research
project and group (Bergsten Systematic En-
tomology Lab: http://www.nrm.se/english/-
researchandcollections/researchdivision/entomology/-
sta/johannesbergsten.6881 en.html) at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History on the taxonomy,
faunistics, phylogeny, colonization, speciation and
evolutionary history of Hydradephagan water beetles
on Madagascar. The work includes DNA labwork,
eldwork, data analyses, help with supervision of
student projects, article- and grant writing. The
DNA labwork will be conducted at the Molecular
Systematics Laboratory at the Swedish Museum of
Natural History.
Qualications To be qualied for the postdoctoral posi-
tion the applicant needs to have a PhD degree (or have a
PhD thesis ready with a date xed within 2014 for the-
sis defense) in Systematics/Phylogenetics/Evolutionary
Biology or similar direction of studies. The PhD degree
should have been received no more than six years before
the deadline for applications.
Criteria for selection Among qualied applicants selec-
tion is made according to scientic merits, quality of
the PhD thesis, personal skills, the applicant ^As docu-
mented knowledge in subjects of relevance for the re-
search area, ability to master English language (both
spoken and written), analytical ability, creativity, ini-
tiative, independence, teamwork and ability to co-
operate. Previous experience with molecular (DNA)
lab work and knowledge of relevant theory and meth-
ods (phylogenetic, dating, species delimitation, biogeo-
graphic and diversication rate analyses) weigh heav-
ily. Experience with entomological eldwork, taxo-
nomic work and French language (spoken in Madagas-car) are consider as additional qualications.
Terms of employment The position is for two years full
time. Start of position should be in 2014 but exact
date up to negotiation with the successful candidate.
The position is nanced by a grant from the Swedish

Dear All,
I would like to draw your attention to two exciting new
job openings for a Postdoctoral Fellow and a Bioinfor-
matician to study the genetics of transmissible cancers
in dogs and Tasmanian devils at the University of Cam-
bridge.
The two posts are part of a Wellcome Trust funded
project within Dr Elizabeth Murchison1s research
group at the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the
University of Cambridge. The project will involve ge-
netic analysis of hundreds of dog and Tasmanian devil
tumour samples in order to investigate the evolution
of transmissible cancers. Our analysis may provide in-
sights into how and why transmissible cancers emerge,
with implications for broader understanding of cancer
evolution. These roles provide an exciting opportunity
to combine cancer genomics with conservation biology
and veterinary research to study the emergence, evolu-
tion and spread of transmissible cancers.
We are looking for two highly motivated and enthusi-
astic individuals to ll these roles.

project entitled: /Asexuality and 'immortality', bdel-
loid rotifers as an evolutionary 'scandal' and a model
system in biology. /This project is funded during 5
years and will start in October 2014.
*Project:*
Bdelloid rotifers are micro-organisms (animals) that
have recently attracted much interest in the scientic
community because of their ancient asexuality and their
extreme resistance to stress, such as desiccation and
high doses of ionizing radiation. They are capable
to survive when their genome is shattered into small
fragments and repair the DNA double strands breaks
(DSBs) (see Hespeels et al., 2014). Repeated cycles
of chromosomal repair are thought to promote allelic
recombination and gene conversion in the absence of
meiosis. Moreover desiccation and the induced DNA
DSBs are also thought to provide a unique opportu-
nity to acquire horizontally transferred genes, thereby
contributing to the adaptive success of these organisms.
In this project, the mechanisms that make bdelloid
rotifers unique in terms of evolutionary strategy and
hyper-resistance to stress will be investigated based on
genomic data recently obtained by our consortium for
the bdelloid rotifer /Adenita vaga/ (see Flot et al, 2013,
Nature 500:453-7). Genomic approaches will be used
to study the dynamics of /A. vaga/ genome during
cycles of desiccation/rehydration/radiationand to de-82 EvolDir September 1, 2014
cipher the genetic expression program that governs the
dierent stages of its life-style. Molecular and cellu-
lar approaches will be developed to unveil and charac-
terize the mechanisms that allow /A. vaga/ to repair
its shattered chromosomes and generate genetic diver-
sity,as well as its dependence with respect to oxida-
tive stress response. Finally, conditions for horizontal
gene transfer and RNA interference will be investigated,
opening the way to the development of reverse genetic
strategies. The ultimate prospect of the project is to
establish bdelloid rotifers as a new model system for
the understanding of fundamental biological processes
such as DNA repair, cell survival and senescence.
*PIs of the consortium:*
Prof. Bernard Hallet (ISV, UCL), Prof. Karine Van
Doninck (URBE, UNamur), Dr. Florence Debacq-
Chainiaux (URBC, UNamur)**
The involved consortium brings together experts in the
elds of evolutionary biology and genomics (K. Van
Doninck, URBE, UNamur), DNA recombination and
genome plasticity (B. Hallet, ISV, UC) and oxidative
stress response (F. Debacq-Chainiaux, URBC, UNa-

Position Description
A postdoctoral position is available in the Department
of Entomology at the University of California Riverside
to work on the genetic and molecular basis of insecticide
resistance in glassy winged sharpshooter (GWSS) - the
primary vector of the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa, which
causes Pierce's Disease in grapevines. Recent insectici-
dal control failures and corresponding surges in GWSS
numbers have raised serious concerns about the status
of insecticide susceptibility in Californian populations
of GWSS. The successful candidate will (1) determine
the current resistance status of GWSS in California
agricultural and nursery settings, (2) elucidate the ge-
netic and molecular underpinnings of any resistance,
and (3) design tools and assays for use in an integrated
insecticide resistance management plan. Additionally,
the postdoc is encouraged to develop new lines of work
(e.g. population genomics, ecological modeling, etc.)
on GWSS.
The project, funded by the California Department of
Food and Agriculture, is a collaborative eort headed

of the project, the postdoc will have substantial expe-
rience designing and conducting bioassays, analyzing
next-generation sequencing data, and communicating
policy recommendations to growers. As such, the po-
sition represents an excellent opportunity to acquire a
unique combination of skills that serve as good training
for various positions in academia, industry, and govern-
ment.September 1, 2014 EvolDir 83

lution. The Workshop on Molecular Evolution consists
of a series of lectures, demonstrations and computer
laboratories that cover theoretical and conceptual as-
pects of molecular evolution with a strong emphasis on
data analysis.
The Workshop has a strong focus on molecular phy-
logenetics, and covers all aspects of phylogenetic work-
ows, including marker selection, phylogeny reconstruc-
tion, time-calibration, as well as detection of natural se-
lection, phylogeography, diversication rates, and trait
evolution patterns. A majority of the schedule is ded-
icated to hands-on learning activities designed by fac-
ulty and the workshop team. This interactive experi-
ence provides Workshop participants with the practical
experience required to meet the challenges presented by
modern evolutionary sciences.

MacquarieU ModelSelection
Oct29-30
Macquarie University is hosting a class on model selec-
tion and multimodel inference, to be held at Macquarie
University on October 29th and 30th. The class will
be taught by Prof. David Anderson, who has been in-
strumental in developing these methods and advancing
them in biology. He literally wrote the book on model
selection and multimodel inference ( >23K citations and
counting), and his workshops are very highly rated, so
this is an opportunity to get straight to the cutting edge
of these methods.
The purpose of the course is to walk through the reason-
ing behind information criterion-based model selection
and many of the pitfalls that arise in the application
of those methods. The goal is to give users a deeper
understanding of these methods, rather than to focus
on any particular statistical software package. Course
attendance includes a free copy of Prof. Anderson's
excellent book on model selection.
The cost of attendance will be $300 AUD. We are
taking bookings through Eventbrite, just search for
'model selection' at eventbrite.com.au or visit http:/-

Nov24-Dec12
Course on Programming for Evolutionary Biology
When: November 24th - December 12th 2014
Location: Bogota, Colombia; Universidad Nacional de
Colombia
Application deadline: August 30th 2014
For the rst time, this course is going to take place in
the Americas. It is closely modeled after our success-
fully established course in Leipzig, Germany.
Detailed information about the course content and how
to apply: http://evopco.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/ \Noth-
ing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of
Evolution" (Dobzhansky, 1973). Today, evolution-
ary biology often involves the analysis of an unprece-
dented amount of information and supports many other
disciplines, such as medicine (evolutionary medicine),
behavioral biology (evolutionary psychology), ecology,and information transfer. Scientists have to analyze
large datasets, which requires computational program-
ming skills to design and apply own ideas into cus-
tomized algorithms.
In this intensive 3 weeks course, students will learn how
to survive in a Linux environment, get hands-on expe-
rience in two widely used programming languages (Perl
and R), and statistical data analysis. The classes will be
given by experts in the eld and consist of lectures and
exercises with the computer. The aim of the course is
to provide the students with the necessary background
and skills to perform computational analyses with a fo-
cus on solving research questions related to genomics
and evolution. The philosophy of the course will be
\learning by doing", which means that the computa-
tional skills will be taught using examples and real data
from evolutionary biology for the exercises. During the
course, students will also propose projects of their own
interest and perform them as nal projects in small
groups under the supervision of a teaching assistant.
This summer school is open for students from all coun-
tries and targeted toward PhD students and postdocs
of evolutionary biology or related research elds with
no or little programming experience who want to be-
come procient in computational evolutionary biology
in a couple of weeks.
The course takes place at the Universidad Nacional de
Colombia.

Workshop on Marine Ecological and Evolutionary Ge-
nomics (MEEG 2014), Vigo, Spain, 14-16 October 2014
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce the MEEG 2014 work-
shop which will be held at ECIMAT marine station
and at the University of Vigo, both in Vigo (Spain).September 1, 2014 EvolDir 97
This workshop aims to introduce ecologists, marine bi-
ologists, geneticists and evolutionary biologists into the
use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data for pop-
ulation genetics analyses commonly used in the eld of
ecology and evolution, and also give the attendants a
hands-on experience of such analyses. The workshop
will include 6 talks from the invited speakers and or-
ganisers and 6 practical sessions where the attendants
will be assisted by the invited speakers in the analysis
of dierent datasets.
The practical sessions are of general interest for ecolo-
gist and evolutionary biologists and therefore not only
marine biologists.
Speakers:
Nicolas Bierne, University of Montpellier (France) Juan
Galindo, University of Vigo (Spain) Patrik Nosil, Uni-
versity of Sheeld (UK) Angel Perez-Diz, University
of Vigo (Spain) Victor Soria-Carrasco, University of

Instructions98 EvolDir September 1, 2014
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
