Dear Colleagues, The abstract submission for the
combined meeting of the Botanical Society of
America, the American Bryological and Licheno-
logical Society, the American Society of Plant
Taxonomists, and the American Fern Society is
now open at: www.botanyconference.org <http://-
www.botanyconference.org >
Conference Overview
The annual Botany Conference brings together a broad
spectrum of researchers, professors, educators and mo-
tivated students, all focused on what’s new and vi-
brant in plant biology. Botany 2006 promises to be
the most stimulating to date as we celebrate one hun-
dred years of promoting and advancing the rich and
diverse ﬁelds of plant sciences. This centennial celebra-
tion brings together our four leading professional so-
cieties, namely the Botanical Society of America, the
American Bryological and Lichenological Society, the
American Society of Plant Taxonomists, and the Amer-
ican Fern Society. The meeting will focus on the im-
portant achievements of our members and will highlightprominent botanists whose contributions have shaped
and advanced the varied ﬁelds of plant biology.
An anticipated 1000 participants will present over 700
scientiﬁc contributions including papers, posters, spe-
cial lectures and 15 symposia. A full slate of ﬁeld trips
and scientiﬁc workshops and social events will round
out the program.
Saturday, July 29, will feature the 5th Educational and
Outreach Forum. This successful component of the
Botany conference is designed to draw educators and re-
searchers involved in the teaching of biology and plant
science from kindergarten through college. The day
will include a range of engaging interactive sessions,
a keynote lecture and a concluding reception that will
provide an opportunity for attendees to discuss and net-
work in a social setting. For the ﬁrst time, teachers will
be able to apply for California Continuing Professional
Education Credits to participate in Forum activities.
Sunday, July 30th, will be an active day of scientiﬁc
workshops, and ﬁeldtrips. Sunday evening will open
the scientiﬁc meeting with the conference-wide Plenary
Lecture, followed by an All Society Mixer.
Monday morning, July 31st, kicks oﬀ the scientiﬁc ses-
sions and symposia. Tuesday afternoon, August 1st,
will feature a conference-wide Poster Session, with an
expected 400 posters featuring current research and re-
cent topics. Scientiﬁc Sessions will conclude on Wednes-
day, August 2nd. Participating Societies will also hold
social events and meetings throughout the week.
Botany 2006 is being held on the campus of Chico State
University, Chico, California. Chico State is located 90
miles north of Sacramento and 174 miles northeast of
San Francisco. Conference hosts will make available
special services to ensure that transportation to and
from Sacramento International Airport will be a conve-
nient and enjoyable part of the conference experience.
Air service directly into Chico is available when con-
necting through San Francisco.
Many conference participants will want to drive from
the airport of their choice to Chico to take advantage
of all the beautiful northern California attractions dur-
ing their stay.
Chico is a great location for Botany 2006, just a short
drive from Mt. Lassen Volcanic National Park to the
north and less than three hours away from Lake Tahoe
to the east.

8th CLONAL PLANT WORKSHOP
Generality, speciﬁcity and diversity of clonal growth
http://www.zbi.ee/Est2006/ June 27-30, 2006 P¨ arnu,
Estonia 2nd circular
We are glad to announce that organisation of the 8th
Clonal Plant Workshop has proceeded well.
The main focus of the meeting is on the similarities and
diﬀerences between diﬀerent taxa and diﬀerent ecosys-
tems in respect to clonal growth, its heterogeneity and
homogeneity. This includes the diversity of processes
that regulate clonal growth and serve as factors and
mechanisms of diversiﬁcation or uniﬁcation of the pat-
terns of clonal growth. Generality and speciﬁcity of dif-
ferent clonality related phenomena and functional char-
acteristics of clonal growth will be examined.
The workshop is divided into four sessions as follows:
Evolutionary processes and phylogenetic patterns.
Chairman: dr. Josef Stuefer. Invited plenary lec-
ture: prof. dr. Spencer Barrett (University of Toronto,
Canada.) “Evolution of mating systems and the possi-
ble key-role of plant clonality in this process”.
Genetic variation, plasticity and population dynamics.
Chairman: prof. dr. Michael J. Hutchings Invited ple-
nary lecture: dr. Lonnie Aarssen (Queens University,
Canada.) “Fitness components in clonal plants”.
Regulatory mechanisms of clonal growth. Chairman:
dr. Ariel Novoplansky. Invited plenary lectures: 1)
dr. Lawren Sack (University of Hawaii, Manoa) “Phys-
iological coordination and hydraulics in clonal plant”;
2) prof. dr. Rick Grosberg (University of California
at Davis, USA) “Clonal organization and regulatory
mechanisms in marine invertebrates”.
Biotic interactions and ecosystem function. Chairman:
prof. dr. Tomas Herben. Invited plenary lecture: prof.
dr. Martin Zobel (Tartu University, Estonia) “Small-
scale pattern and dynamics of plant communities - does
clonal growth matter?”
The registration to the conference is open at http:/-/www.zbi.ee/Est2006/register.php . Please sign in (by
doing this fast you help us to organise the meeting) and
distribute the information among your colleagues.
The next good news is that we have connected the
workshop with a doctoral school event (27.06 - 01.07)
and therefore the participation of graduate students on
the workshop is free of the conference fee (meals, coﬀe-
breaks, excursions and materials). The full programme
of the PhD school is available at http://www.zbi.ee/-
Est2006/ . We ask you all to advertise the event among
your students.
We advise you to book your accommodation
through travel agent Karin Tamm in HermannReisid
Karin.Tamm@hermann.ee as quickly as possible. She
can also help you in ﬁnding suitable ﬂights. The
program will start at 10 on June 27.
The conference fee is 180 EUR that covers all meals,
conference dinner, coﬀee breaks, workshop materials,
and two excursions. The deadline for payment is April,
15. For details, please, see the web page.
Abstract submission deadline is March, 1. Abstracts on
one page should be sent electronically to Marek Sammul
marek@zbi.ee. The preferred ﬁle format for abstracts is
rtf. Please indicate on the top of the abstract whether
you want to give an oral presentation or poster presen-
tation.
Thank you for your patience, and we hope that you can
register ﬂuently and arrange your trip without troubles.

The 2006 meeting of evolutionary biologists in the Pa-
ciﬁc Northwest will take place April 21-23, 2006 at Ft.
Warden State Park in Washington. We had about 140
people attend the 2004 meeting and have expanded our
capacity for this year, but please register early to make
sure that we have a slot for you. We have made every
eﬀort to keep costs down (registration covers all hous-
ing and food), and a simple goal of the meeting is to
have a good time with friends, old and new.Registration and general information is available at:
http:// www.zoology.ubc.ca/evo-wibo The meeting
has no concurrent sessions, and talks and posters are
presented by faculty, postdocs and students. The slate
of talks will be chosen by the organizing committee. We
strongly encourage faculty to nominate/encourage out-
standing students and postdocs to give platform talks
(send an email Patrick Phillips, pphil@uoregon.edu,
with suggestions).
n.b. Evo-WIBO stands for Evolutionary Biologists
from Washington, Idaho, British Columbia and Ore-
gon, although we draw much more widely than that,
including California, Alaska, and Montana. As punish-
ment for coming up with this name in the ﬁrst place,
Ray Huey will be giving the plenary talk for the meet-
ing Sunday morning.

Dear Colleagues,
Herewith we would like to invite you to join the
*19^th Annual Meeting of the Plant Population Biol-
ogy Meeting of the Ecological Society of **Germany**,
**Switzerland** and **Austria** (Gf ¨O),*
taking place in Halle from 24 May to 27 May 2006 or-
ganized jointly by the UFZ-Centre for Environmental
Research and the Geobotanical Institute of the Univer-
sity of Halle. Please note that the date diﬀers from
the one given in the GfOe-Letter, the meeting will take
place as always it over the Ascension Day.
The annual meeting is being held in English and usu-
ally attended by more than one hundred people from
all over Europe. Priority is given to young researchers
to present results from their PhD theses. The focus
of the meeting in 2006 is on interactions of plants with
other species, recognizing that plants have to cope with
a large number of competitors, herbivores, pathogens6 EvolDir March 1, 2006
and symbionts. Therefore, to understand the popula-
tion biology of plants, botanist would have to broaden
their scope and incorporate these interactors in their
studies. But presentations from the whole ﬁeld of plant
population biology are welcome.
Halle is a small, medieval town approximately 200 km
south of Berlin that harbors one of the oldest Universi-
ties of Germany. The Institute of Geobotany is one
of the largest ecological institutes in Germany with
a long lasting history in plant ecology (see http://-
www.geobotanik.uni-halle.de/ ). The UFZ-Centre for
Environmental Research was founded 13 years ago as a
competence centre for the heavily contaminated land-
scape of the former German Democratic Republic. Re-
search in the Department of Community Ecology fo-
cuses on biodiversity, population biology of invasive
species, species interactions and ecosystem functioning
(seehttp://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=798 ).

/www.broad.mit.edu/events/hapmapmeeting The
Analysis Committee of the International HapMap
Project organized two previous meetings (April 2004
and March 2005) at which investigators from around
the world reviewed emerging data from the HapMap
Project and related eﬀorts, shared analyses, and
debated directions for future research. Phase I of
HapMap was published in October 2005, and Phase II
is now complete.
This meeting, the third in the series, has as its pri-
mary focus the application of the HapMap resource in
human disease studies, population genetic and evolu-
tionary insights obtained from the data, and emerging
themes that point to new resources (such as knowledge
of structural variants) required to perform human ge-
netic research.
“Beyond Hapmap” is an unequalled opportunity for
a diverse community of investigators-those involved in
the HapMap Project, in population genetic and statis-
tical analysts, and in genetic studies of human diseases-
to come together to deﬁne and discuss a range of issues
related to the use of the HapMap resource, and to iden-
tify paths forward to discover genetic contributions to
human disease.
We invite participation and registration for this meeting
by investigators (both mid-career and trainees) from
these and other related ﬁelds. We strongly encourage
the submission of an abstract from interested scientists,
as more than half of the presentation slots at the meet-
ing are reserved for talks selected from the abstracts.

NewYorkU MolPrimatology Mar2-4March 1, 2006 EvolDir 9
The Center for the Study of Human Origins at New
York University is sponsoring a conference entitled
“Molecular Primatology: Progress and Promise”, to be
held from March 02 to March 04, 2006. The conference
will bringing together a diverse, international group of
leading experts on the application of molecular data in
primatology to explore the breadth of current, cutting-
edge research in primate evolutionary biology, to pro-
vide a prospective view on the ﬁeld’s future promise,
and to forge new collaborative connections among re-
search groups from around the globe.
The conference is organized around four major themes:
Molecular Ecology ? the use of molecular techniques
for examining kinship, behavior, dispersal patterns, and
social organization in wild primates, Conservation Ge-
netics ? the application of molecular techniques to
primate conservation biology, Molecular Diversity and
Adaptation ? the adaptive signiﬁcance of patterns of
molecular diversity within and between primate taxa,
and Behavioral Genetics and Comparative Genomics ?
the genetic underpinnings of inter-individual behavioral
variation and insights from recent genomic studies into
the patterns and functional signiﬁcance of diﬀerences
in genome structure across primate taxa.
On the ﬁrst two days of the conference – which are free
and open to the public – these four central themes will
be the focus of a series of presentations by four to ﬁve
invited speakers, followed by an extended discussion in-
volving the speakers, other invited guests, and confer-
ence attendees. Poster sessions held on the ﬁrst two
days of the conference, which will showcase research
by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in
molecular primatology from the greater New York area
and from the laboratories of the invited speakers. Each
of the ﬁrst two days of the conference will close with an
evening plenary talk exploring the history and future
promise of using molecular data in primate phyloge-
netic studies, a topic that is not covered explictly in
any of the thematic sessions.

Third Intl. Workshop on the Emergence and Evolution
of Linguistic ommunication (EELC III)
http://bdc.brain.riken.go.jp/eelc2006/ Rome, Italy, 30
Sept. - 1 Oct. 2006.
As part of the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB)
conference http://www.sab06.org/ Invited Speakers:
Peter Gardenfors (Lund University, Sweden), Naoto
Iwahashi (ATR, Japan), Elena Lieven (Max Planck
Institute, Germany), E¨ ors Szathm´ ary (E¨ otv¨ os Lor´ and
University, Hungary)
Scope of the Workshop Language is generally consid-
ered as the hallmark of human intelligence. One im-
portant way to study why this is the case, is to inves-
tigate how linguistic communication has evolved. In
the past decade, this research area has received a lot
of attention from the scientiﬁc community and could
be considered as one of the main areas of Artiﬁcial In-
telligence and Cognitive Science. The EELC III work-
shop will focus on empirical and modelling research on
the emergence of symbol grounding and other aspects
of linguistic communication in language evolution and
language acquisition. The key questions relate to how
symbolic communication can emerge from interactions
of individuals with their environment, including other
individuals, and how such communication can become
meaningful to the individual or population. Research
methods that are used to study these issues include ex-
perimental and observational studies on child language
acquisition and animal communication; theoretical and
computational modelling; and (robotic) simulations of
adaptive behaviour. The workshop aims to provide
leading scientists in the interdisciplinary area of lan-
guage evolution and language acquisition a platform to
present their latest results and discuss areas of further
research.
Until about 15 years ago, there was very little pro-
ductive research in the study of language evolution.
However, with the increased advancements of compu-
tational techniques and other empirical methods, the
ﬁeld of language evolution has grown to become one of
the major research areas in cognitive science. While
the ﬁeld is largely interdisciplinary with contributions
from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, biology, an-10 EvolDir March 1, 2006
thropology, philosophy and computer science, the latter
has proven to be among the most inﬂuential disciplines.
A reason for this is that empirical evidence on language
evolution is scarce and computer simulations oﬀer a
good testbed for investigating hypotheses. One of the
major driving forces for language evolution is often con-
sidered to be language acquisition. Language can be
transmitted over subsequent generations if individuals
can learn language. Moreover, it has been claimed that
the stages of children’s language acquisition mirrors the
stages of language evolution. So, the current EELC will
not only look at studies on the evolution of language,
but also at studies on language acquisition.
Although many computer simulations take the emer-
gence of symbol grounding for granted, recently there
has been an increase in studies that focus on issues
relating to the emergence of grounded communication
systems. The EELC III will therefore have ’adaptive
approaches to symbol grounding and beyond’ as its cen-
tral theme, though contributions are not limited to this
theme.
EELC Symposium Series This workshop is the third
edition of the successful workshop on the Emergence
and Evolution of Linguistic Communication. The
ﬁrst one was held in 2004 in Kanazawa (Japan) un-
der the auspices of the Japanese Society for Artiﬁ-
cial Intelligence (JSAI) and the second one in Hatﬁeld
(United Kingdom) under the auspices of the Society
for the Study of Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Simulation
of Behaviour (AISB). Details of the second EELC are
found on http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/comqcln/-
EELC05.html . The Third International Workshop on
the Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communi-
cation will be part of the Simulation of Adaptive Be-
havior conference. The coincidence with SAB permits
a better exchange with other researchers working in the
simulation of adaptive behaviour ﬁeld.

Wageningen LandscapeGenetics
2007 CallForPapers
Dear colleagues,
Landscape genetics is an emerging topic in landscape
ecology. Molecular genetic methods allow us to test
speciﬁc landscape ecological hypotheses concerning the
eﬀects of landscape structure on the actual movement of
organisms, the connectivity of habitats from an organ-
ism’s perspective, or the eﬀect of landscape dynamics
(natural or anthropogenic changes) on metapopulation
dynamics.
At the 2005 US-IALE meeting in Syracuse, we held
a ﬁrst landscape genetics symposium, where primarily
geneticists were invited to provide an introduction to
landscape genetics for a landscape ecological audience.
The collection of papers presented there will be pub-
lished in Landscape Ecology this year.
For the 2007 IALE World congress in Wageningen, we
propose a follow-up symposium, speciﬁcally welcom-
ing any papers that report applications of molecular
methods for testing landscape ecological hypotheses as
outlined above. Typically, we expect these studies to
address landscape eﬀects beyond isolation-by-distance,
e.g. eﬀects of matrix resistance or landscape change on
gene ﬂow and population genetic structure.
If you would like to contribute to the planned sympo-
sium, please send us the following preliminary informa-
tion (all this can be updated later if necessary): - Title -
Author(s) - Tentative abstract or a few lines describing
the study
IMPORTANT DEADLINE: Please contact us with the
above information before Feb 23, as the deadline for
symposia proposals is coming up soon.

Trondheim AvianSocialForaging
Ph.D. Project: ’Social foraging in cooperative birds’
We are seeking a PhD candidate to undertake detailed
behavioural observations and experiments to explore
the foraging strategies of wild cooperative birds, specif-
ically concerning state-dependence, risk-sensitivity and
cooperation. In the past, such experiments have almost
exclusively been conducted on socially isolated birds
held under laboratory conditions. However, habituated
populations of wild Siberian jays (Arvidsjaur, northern
Sweden) and apostlebirds (UNSW Fowlers Gap, Aus-
tralia) make it possible to carry out more appropriate
tests of evolutionary predictions within a natural eco-
logical and social context. The starting point for under-
standing behavioural decision-making in these systems
will be one based around individual ?state? (variation
in body mass). Diurnal and seasonal variation in so-
cial foraging strategies will be explored, including com-
parisons during periods of food-caching and helping-at-
the-nest. Quantitative comparisons will be made be-
tween observational data on natural foraging and the
results of experimental tests using artiﬁcial feeders in
the ﬁeld. This position is fully funded for 4 years,
and includes research expenses. The position carries
a 25% teaching responsibility, contributing toward the
Department’s courses in animal behaviour. Application

UBasel ParentOﬀspring Interaction
Ph.D.-position: Evolution and genetics of parental sup-
ply and oﬀspring demand
We are seeking a motivated Ph.D.-candidate with keen
interest in evolutionary and behavioral ecology, the ge-
netics underlying behaviors, and the performance of ex-
perimental research.
In our group, we are studying the evolution of inter-
actions/communication among family members using
both theoretical and experimental approaches. Of par-
ticular interest are the provisioning of care by parents,
and the demand for care by oﬀspring. Such social inter-
actions can create evolutionary complexities by induc-
ing the potential for conﬂicts of interest (supply and
demand need not coincide) and aﬀecting the genetic
trait architecture due to indirect genetic eﬀects (IGE).
Both factors can have profound eﬀects on the evolu-
tion of interactions and communication among family
members.
A major aim of our research is to experimentally dis-
entangle genetic and environmental components under-
lying parent-oﬀspring interactions and communication
(including behavioral and chemosensory aspects), and
investigate patterns of parent-oﬀspring coadaptation as
test of recent indirect genetic eﬀects models (K¨ olliker
et al. 2005. Am. Nat. 166, 506-516). Our ex-
perimental system is the European earwig (Forﬁcula
auricularia), a sub-social insect species where females
tend eggs, and care for the ﬁrst larval instars by pro-
visioning them with food. We are maintaining a newly
founded lab population of this species. The successful
candidate will carry out breeding experiments and be-
havioral and chemosensory experiments to investigate
the nature, functional signiﬁcance and genetic architec-
ture of maternal and oﬀspring traits (e.g., “solicitation
pheromones”; K¨ olliker et al. 2005. Anim. Behav. 69,
959-966).
Our research group is situated at the Zoological Insti-
tute of the University of Basel, and part of the larger
group in Evolutionary Biology lead by Prof. Dieter
Ebert. Additional groups at the institute and in the
area of evolutionary biology will be established in the
nearby future.
The successful candidate should have a
Diploma/Master degree (or equivalent) in biology/ natural sciences. Statistical skills will be an ad-
vantage, an interest in acquiring advanced statistical
knowledge a prerequisite. Earliest possible starting
date is April 1st, 2006.

UEastAnglia InsectAgeing
HOW DOES AGEING AND INBREEDING INFLU-
ENCE SPERM QUALITY AND MALE FERTILITY
IN INSECTS?
Starting October 2006. Supervised by Matt Gage,
Brent Emerson and Tracey Chapman, School of Bio-
logical Sciences, University of East Anglia, NORWICH
NR47TJ http://www.uea.ac.uk/bio/ Widespread ev-
idence shows that male ageing is associated with de-
clines in sperm quality and fertility. Similarly, re-
productive compromise occurs under inbreeding. This
NERC-funded Ph.D. project ( http://www.nerc.ac.uk/-
funding/students/ ) project will determine how ageing
and inbreeding inﬂuence spermatozoal competence us-
ing insect models. Spermatozoa are generated contin-
uously from dividing stem cells and mutations in the
male germline may accumulate as individuals age or
are inbred, while pathologies in the ageing/inbred testis
may disrupt normal spermatogenesis. The project will
seek to identify whether fertility in old and/or inbred
males is reduced because of haploid damage, or diploid-
derived compromises to sperm form and function.
The research models will be laboratory strains of the
cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, and the ﬂour beetle Tri-
bolium castaneum. Both present excellent attributes
for this work, and are familiar subjects in our labo-
ratory for investigating sperm competition and sexual
selection. Selective breeding can easily generate diﬀer-
ential levels of inbreeding in laboratory strains. Re-
peated measures of either individuals through time (G.18 EvolDir March 1, 2006
bimaculatus), or diﬀerent-aged cohorts (T. castanuem)
will allow direct tests using representative sample sizes.
G. bimaculatus adult males live for ~6 months in the
laboratory. Sperm are transferred via an externally-
attached spermatophore, so that sperm can be recov-
ered from individuals repeatedly through time without
harm to the male. Histological changes in the testis will
also be screened. T. castaneum is exceptionally long-
lived (up to 4 years) for its size and ecotype, allow-
ing measures of Senescence in a domesticated species
with an unnaturally long lifespan. For both species,
females continuously oviposit and egg development can
be tracked to assess fertilization and embryogenesis suc-
cess. Phenotypic and genotypic spermatozoal compro-
mise will be determined by a range of in vitro and in
vivo histological and molecular approaches. In addition
to measuring the consequences for fertility per se, the
inﬂuence of male age and inbreeding in sperm compe-
tition will be measured.
Applicants should have at least a 2:1 degree in bio-
logical sciences and a strong interest in evolutionary
biology. The student will join an active research
group at UEA containing a number of Ph.D. stu-
dents and postdoctoral researchers exploring sexual
selection, sexual conﬂict, reproductive genetics and
speciation. The School of Biological Sciences at UEA
(http://www.uea.ac.uk/bio/ ) provides an excellent

UJena FloralEvoDevo
2 PhD positions or 1 Postdoc position
In our group we have openings for two graduate stu-
dents or one Postdoc with strong interest in the evolu-
tionary developmental biology of plants. The project
focuses on the evolution of the interaction of ﬂoral
homeotic proteins (MADS-domain proteins) by inte-
grating experimental and bioinformatic approaches.
Floral homeotic proteins of higher eudicotyledonous
ﬂowering plants are key determinants of ﬂoral organ
identity. They exert their function by constituting mul-
timeric complexes that bind to cis-regulatory DNA sites
in their target genes. We wonder how this situation
originated during evolution by studying evolutionary
informative taxa such as gymnosperms and basal ﬂow-
ering plants. Given the enormous importance of ﬂoral
homeotic proteins and their interaction behaviour for
ﬂower development in eudicots, unraveling the evolu-
tionary trajectories that led to the present day inter-
action network may help to elucidate the origin of the
angiosperm ﬂower - still on of the most enigmatic ques-
tions in biology.
In the experimental part of the project, interactions
of ﬂoral homeotic proteins are studied by “wet lab
techniques” such as gel retardation assays, the yeast-
2/3/4-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation as-
says. Candidates applying for this part of the project
should have a Diploma or Master degree in Biology,
Biochemistry or related ﬁelds. Experience in the tech-20 EvolDir March 1, 2006
niques mentioned above is of advantage, but not ab-
solutely required. Demonstrable practical experience
in standard molecular biology techniques, including
molecular cloning is essential, however.
In the bioinformatics part of the project, the question
is addressed as to whether protein-protein interactions
aﬀect the rates of protein evolution. Candidates apply-
ing for this part of the project should have a Diploma
or Master degree in Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Bi-
ology or related ﬁelds, and should have demonstrable
experience with methods of phylogeny reconstruction
(e.g. Neighbor Joining, Maximum Likelihood, Maxi-
mum Parsimony) using sequence data, and profound
knowledge of Molecular Evolution methods.
Postdocs applying for the position should be prepared
to work in both parts of the project. Candidates will be
considered on a competitive basis and only applications
containing all the required documents will be reviewed.
Applicants will be considered from 1st of March 2006
until the positions are ﬁlled. Interested candidates
should send the following, preferably as PDF ﬁles via
e-mail:
1. A statement detailing your research experience and
scientiﬁc interests.
2. An updated Curriculum Vitae (including a complete
list of publications).
3. The names and contact information of at least two

ULiverpool Coevolution
Experimental coevolution with multiple parasites
Dr. M.A. Brockhurst
(michael.brockhurst@liverpool.ac.uk),Dr. A. Fen-ton (a.fenton@liverpool.ac.uk)
Antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites,
the reciprocal evolution of host defence and parasite
counter-defence, is ubiquitous and there is a consider-
able body of work exploring this issue in simple one-
host-one-parasite systems (e.g., Sasaki 2000; Restif &
Koella 2003). However, coevolution with multiple par-
asite species is likely to be a major selection pressure
for host organisms in nature ? there may be various
positive and negative interactions, each modifying the
optimal strategies of the component species, aﬀecting
the evolutionary dynamics of the community. While ex-
posure to multiple parasites is likely to have far reach-
ing ecological, evolutionary and health implications no
experimental studies (and few theoretical ones) have
looked at coevolution between a host species and mul-
tiple parasite species.
An experimental evolution approach using populations
of bacteria and their viral parasites (bacteriophage) is
ideal for studying host-parasite coevolution, due to the
rapid generation time of hosts and parasites, and the
ease of experimental manipulation. We have previously
demonstrated rapid coevolution between Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens and phage phi2 (Brockhurst et al. 2003).
This project will extend previous ﬁndings using a mix-
ture of experimentation and theory to investigate the
eﬀect of exposure to multiple parasite species on: i) co-
evolutionary dynamics; ii) resistance evolution includ-
ing costs and epistasis; iii) host and parasite local adap-
tation. As such, this project brings together ideas con-
cerning host-parasite coevolution, the evolution of life
history strategies and community ecology and will ap-
peal to anyone interested in testing evolutionary theory.

UMelbourne SexualSelection
PhD Scholarship opportunity in the Dept of Zoology,
University of Melbourne
An exciting opportunity exists for a student to under-
take a PhD study on Mutual sexual selection and sperm
competition in the Black Swan.
We are seeking a highly motivated student to undertake
a PhD study as part of a research project investigating
pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection in this iconic
bird.
Both male and female black swans have ornamental
wing feathers that have a variety of complex social and
sexual functions. This project will investigate the evo-
lutionary signiﬁcance of these mutual’ ornaments. It
will involve ﬁeld experiments (performed in conjunc-
tion with the deployment of an innovative transponder-
based system to detect and record copulations) as well
as laboratory-based paternity analysis, and participa-
tion in the management of a captive colony of swans.
The prospective student should have, or expect to ob-
tain, a ﬁrst- class or upper second-class honours degree
or equivalent. Field experience, previous experience in
a molecular laboratory, and technical talent with elec-
tronics are not essential but would be an advantage.
Stipend: $22,000 per annum (plus full fee remission for
international students)
Applications close 31 March 2006.

USheﬃeld HumanAging
PhD Studentship
Reproduction, senescence and longevity in humans
Supervisor: Dr Virpi Lummaa ( www.sheﬃeld.ac.uk/-
aps/contacts/acadstaﬀ/lummaa.html )
Department of Animal & Plant Sciences, University of
Sheﬃeld, U.K.
Whereas most animals reproduce until they die, in hu-
mans, females can survive long after being unable to
reproduce themselves. This represents an enigma for
current evolutionary thinking, for there should be no
selection for living beyond one’s reproductive capacity,
but instead surplus resources should be allocated earlierto reproduction to maximise ﬁtness. One explanation
is that, if mothers can increase the reproductive suc-
cess of their adult oﬀspring by helping with childcare,
then a woman with genes for living beyond fertility may
forward more copies of their genes to following gener-
ations than women dying early. Indeed, our previous
research has shown that human females gain signiﬁcant
increments to their ﬁtness by surviving beyond their re-
productive potential, as for every 10 years that women
survived beyond the age 50 in historical Finland, two
extra grandchildren were produced.
That female humans accrue ﬁtness during both repro-
ductive and post-reproductive years indicates that the
reproductive success gained prior to menopause repre-
sents only a fraction of total ﬁtness. This has important
implications for estimates of ﬁtness, life-history trait
optimisation and rates of senescence in humans that
have typically been limited to analyses during reproduc-
tive phases. Consequently, it now appears that invest-
ment during reproduction is likely to trade oﬀ with ﬁt-
ness gains during post-reproduction, and that ﬁtness in
humans is governed by optimisation of trade-oﬀs during
both reproductive and post-reproductive phases. This
leads to the intriguing possibility that humans suﬀer
from both reproductive and post-reproductive senes-
cence, with the relative importance of ﬁtness accrued
during each phase determining the ultimate lifespan.
This PhD project will determine the evolutionary
and ecological causes and consequences of cooperative
breeding and prolonged post-reproductive lifespan in
humans. As the model system, we use extensive pre-
collected, demographic pedigree datasets from several
pre-industrial human populations. The data includes
all basic life-history information as well as a range of
ecological variables (social class, weather, harvest qual-
ity, famine, war, disease). The project will address the
following questions;
1. How does reproductive timing and investment inﬂu-
ence rates of reproductive and post-reproductive senes-
cence? 2. How are rates of senescence inﬂuenced by
interactions between reproductive timing/investment
and maternal characteristics, ecology and demography?
3. How do patterns of ﬁtness acquisition account for
menopause, prolonged post-reproductive lifespan and
ultimately the age of death?
The PhD project will be part of a long-term research
project on life-history strategies in human populations.
The student will join the large and lively Evolution and
Behaviour research group in the Department of Animal
and Plant Sciences in Sheﬃeld. Students with a good
ﬁrst degree or Masters degree in areas such as Evolu-
tion, Behaviour, or Biological Sciences are encouragedMarch 1, 2006 EvolDir 23

PhD Studentship
Genetic Basis of a Sexual Weapon
Supervisor: Dr Jon Slate ( http://www.jon-
slate.staﬀ.shef.ac.uk/ )
Department of Animal & Plant Sciences, University of
Sheﬃeld
The Soay sheep of St Kilda, a remote group of Scottish
Islands, are one of the most-intensively-studied verte-
brate populations in the world. From an evolution-
ary genetic viewpoint the population is interesting be-
cause several phenotypic polymorphisms are present, of
which the most striking is presence/absence of horns.
Males are either normal horned or have scurs (very
small horns, that cannot be used as weapons). Fe-
males are either normal horned, scurred, or polled (a
complete absence of horns). Given that scurred males
cannot win aggressive interactions with normal-horned
males it is surprising that scurred genes persist in the
population. We have recently mapped the horns gene
to sheep chromosome 10, but we do not yet know what
the gene is. In this project the student will attempt to
ﬁne-map and identify the horns locus by studying pedi-
grees of Soay sheep and two domestic breeds - Meri-
nos and Dorsets. The project involves collaboration
with Professor Josephine Pemberton at Edinburgh Uni-versity, and is jointly funded by the BBSRC and an
Edinburgh-based CASE partner, Catapult. CASE stu-
dentships oﬀer an additional £2500 p.a. above stan-
dard studentships. The project will involve visits to
Edinburgh, and possibly New Zealand, as well as an op-
portunity to carry out ﬁeld work on St Kilda. St Kilda
is a world heritage site, and one of the most spectacu-
lar archipelagoes in the UK ( http://www.kilda.org.uk ).
The Department of Animal & Plant Sciences has a dy-
namic and very well equipped Molecular Ecology labo-
ratory and was awarded the maximum possible grade,

cants should have an interest in one or more of the

Two graduate student positions (Masters or Ph.D.
level) at the University of Victoria, British Columbia.
I am seeking graduate students who are interested in
insect evolutionary ecology and/or host-parasite inter-
actions.
One position will be to work on an NSF funded project
in collaboration with Martha Hunter (U. of Arizona)
examining interactions between the reproductive par-
asites Wolbachia and Cardinium and their parasitoid
wasp host Encarsia inaron. Wolbachia and Cardinium
are bacterial endosymbionts of insects that manipulate
host reproduction in diverse ways. In Encarsia inaron,
symbiont infection causes reproductive incompatibili-
ties, such that uninfected female hosts produce virtu-
ally no oﬀspring when mating with infected male hosts.
The goals of this project are to compare the incompat-
ibilities induced by these unrelated symbionts, and toMarch 1, 2006 EvolDir 25
understand how symbionts interact in their shared host,
using diﬀerential antibiotic curing experiments, genetic
crosses, and quantitative PCR measures of symbiont
density. While this project will be based in Victoria,
students will undertake a signiﬁcant portion of the re-
search at the U. of Arizona.
The second position is to work on an NSERC
funded project on evolution and ecology of associa-
tions between Drosophila and their parasitic nema-
todes. Mushroom-breeding Drosophila are commonly
infected with parasitic nematodes with strong eﬀects
on host ﬁtness, including sterility. Possible projects
include examining the role of parasitism in shaping dif-
ferentiation of closely related Drosophila species, and
testing for recent host range expansions using a combi-
nation of phylogeography and experimental infections.
This project will involve laboratory work in Victoria
and ﬁeldwork in western Canada.

There are immediate opportunities for qualiﬁed grad-
uate students (MSc & PhD) to work in Dan Heath?s
Evolutionary & Conservation Genetics lab at the Great
Lakes Institute for Environmental Research (GLIER)
at the University of Windsor (Ontario, Canada). Avail-
able projects include;
1) BC rainbow tout conservation genetics (MSc): The
project will include ﬁeld sampling and molecular ge-
netic lab analysis of the Babine Lake rainbow trout,
one of the few large-body morph populations in British
Columbia, Canada. Working with BC Provincial and
First Nations ﬁsheries technicians, the student will col-
lect DNA samples from adult and juvenile rainbow
trout in Babine Lake as well as from tributary spawning
populations. Microsatellite and mtDNA analysis of thesamples will be performed in the Conservation Genetics
and Environmental Genomics Facilities at the GLIER.
The goal will be to identify the stock composition in
the lake and assign sport and food-ﬁshery captures to
speciﬁc source populations.
2) Feeding ecology of Lake Erie yellow perch preda-
tors (PhD): The project will include developing molec-
ular genetic methods to determine gut contents to
species level, validating the approach with captive
yellow perch predators, and applying the technique
to wild-caught yellow perch predators. The student
will apply quantitative real-time PCR techniques with
species-diagnostic mtDNA fragments to quantitatively
determine the species present in digested gut content
matter taken from ﬁeld-caught piscivorous ﬁsh. The
goal of the project is to determine the relative role of
predation on Lake Erie yellow perch population struc-
ture and dynamics.
3) Mate choice in Chinook salmon: eﬀects on ﬁtness
(PhD): The student will work as part of a team in-
vestigating the relative ﬁtness of artiﬁcially-bred versus
naturally-bred Chinook salmon. Adult Chinook salmon
will be provided with the opportunity for mate choice,
while ﬁsh from the same stock will be bred artiﬁcially
as a control group. Behavioural, immunological, phys-
iological and genetic analyses will be used to partition
diﬀerences in performance of the oﬀspring into additive
genetic, environmental and genotype-by-environmental
interaction components, and ultimately to assess the
economics of the breeding strategies for aquaculture
and conservation production. The student will focus on
using molecular and quantitative genetics to partition
oﬀspring trait variance into genetic, environmental and
interaction components. The student will also have the
to opportunity to assess gene expression patterns using
both Q-RT-PCR and DNA microarray approaches.

PhD position in spatial population ecology I am look-
ing for a PhD-student to participate in the “Spatial
heterogeneity, functional responses and predator-prey
dynamics”, ﬁnancially supported by the Swedish Re-
search Council.
Why are there so many species? This question is moti-
vated by the ﬁnding that simple models and model sys-
tems are fragile - species extinctions are ubiquitous- and
increasing the realism by including more species tend
to make systems even more unstable. Many ecologists
believe that the answer is that spatial heterogeneity sta-
bilizes ecological systems. The objective of the project
is therefore to increase our understanding of how spa-
tial heterogeneity aﬀects predator-prey dynamics. This
is done by applying and developing a new theoretical
tool, moment approximation, which can be used to in-
vestigate how population dynamics are inﬂuenced by
spatial heterogeneity. The project includes testing a
predator-prey model based on moment approximation,
developing empirical models of the relationship between
predator-prey covariance and population densities, and
studying the relationship between covariance and den-
sity dynamics in published models and empirical data
sets. The project has an emphasis on mathematical
and statistical models but will also include predator-
prey experiments in the lab. The project is intellec-
tually challenging but will likely yield publications in
top-ranked journals.

Vacancy number: 1.2005.00247
The department of Animal Ecology, which is part of
the Faculty of Earth and Life Sciences, Vrije Univer-
siteit Amsterdam (The Netherlands), has a vacancy for
a PhD student.
Job description
The student will conduct a research project enti-
tled: Stress-based expression proﬁles in soil arthro-
pods, which is part of the program Assessing the liv-
ing soil. An ecogenomics approach to explore and un-
lock sustainable life support functions of soils. Ge-
nomic tools will be used to characterize and evaluate
biological functions of the living soil. The aim is to
link expression proﬁles with characteristics of the soil,
in particular with the degree and type of pollution.
Eventually this will lead to the development of a rapid
microarray-based method of soil diagnosis. The aim of
this Ph.D. project is to provide an understanding at
the gene expression level of inhibition of Folsomia can-
dida reproduction, growth and survival by soil contam-
inants. Firstly, the invertebrate soil quality chip will
be used to study transcription proﬁles of springtails ex-
posed to clean soils from diﬀerent environments to cre-
ate a normal operating range (NOR) of the F. candida
transcriptome. Subsequently, eﬀects of soil contami-
nants (metals, PAHs, oil) on the F. candida NOR willbe investigated. The data will give more insight in the
molecular consequences of sub lethal eﬀects and will
contribute to the development of a new framework for
the diagnosis of ecological quality of soils.
Requirements
Molecular biologist with an interest in ecotoxicology;
Experience in statistical analysis of gene expression
data is an advantage;
Good social skills necessary for working in the labora-
tory with colleagues.
Particularities

uates
Are you interested in gaining ﬁeld research experi-
ence and learning about the ecology and evolution
of plants and plant-animal interactions in fragmented
prairie? We are looking for ﬁeld assistants (2-4 under-
graduates and one recent grad) for an NSF-funded re-
search project on habitat fragmentation of the tallgrass
prairie. We are investigating how small plant popu-
lation sizes inﬂuence inbreeding, demography, pollina-
tion, and herbivory in the purple coneﬂower (Echinacea
angustifolia).
No experience is necessary, but you must be enthusi-
astic and hard-working. You will survey natural plant
populations, measure ﬁtness and ﬂoral traits in exper-
imental plots, hand-pollinate plants, observe & collect
insects, and assist in all aspects of research. Housing is

LeibnizInst FishPopulations
The Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland
Fisheries (IGB) in Berlin, Germany invites 6 applica-
tions for an interdisciplinary project on understanding
the dynamics of recreational ﬁshing.
The IGB is a member of the Research Society “Wil-
helm Gottfried Leibniz” (WGL) comprising 84 inde-
pendent, non-governmentally based, basic research in-
stitutes. IGB is devoted to study spatio-temporal dy-
namics, structures and functions of freshwater ecosys-
tems. From an applied research perspective, the IGB
has a major commitment to study ﬁsh and ﬁsheries
systems including aquaculture and to develop scien-
tiﬁcally based principles for sustainable management.
Two of the ﬁve departments are exclusively dealing
with ﬁsh and ﬁsheries. The IGB has an annual bud-
get of more than 8 million , hosts 65 full time sci-
entists from various scientiﬁc disciplines such as ﬁsh
ecologists, ﬁsheries scientists, hydrologists, chemists,
microbiologists, limnologists, 20 Ph.D. students de-
pending on external funding and about 60 adminis-
trative and technical employees. Several experimen-
tal lakes, extensive laboratory facilities practicing cut-
ting edge molecular genetics and physiological meth-
ods are available including a brand new wet lab con-
structed in 2005. About 20 earthen ponds and several
tanks and raceways are also available together with a
several ﬁeld stations for aquatic research. The insti-
tute is located in a water-rich landscape in the highly
vibrant German capital Berlin, next to the 700 ha
Lake Mueggelsee, and is in its form unique in central
Europe. The institute has close collaborations with
all three Berlin universities and runs a Masters Pro-
gramme entitled “Fishery Science and Aquaculture” at
Humboldt-University of Berlin ( http://www.agrar.hu-
berlin.de/studium/index sten.html ). Therefore, scien-
tiﬁc work conducted at IGB can be submitted as a
doctoral dissertation to one of the Berlin universities.March 1, 2006 EvolDir 33
Heads of Departments typically are also university pro-
fessors. Within IGB, the research group dealing with
“Sustainable Recreational Fisheries Management” lead
by Dr. Robert Arlinghaus, has recently been awarded
a prestigious grant for the period 2006-2008/2009 en-
titled “Adaptive Dynamics and Management of Cou-
pled Social-Ecological Recreational Fisheries (ADAPT-
FISH)”. Within this program one post doc position and
ﬁve PhD student positions are now open.
6 research positions All positions start as soon as pos-
sible and are limited to three years.
1 Post doc position (Ref. nr. ADAPTFISH-1) Integra-
tive modelling of ﬁsh-angler interactions at the land-
scape level.
1 PhD student position (Ref. nr. ADAPTFISH-2) In-
stitutional conditions for sustainable governance of a
transforming inland ﬁsheries sector.
1 PhD student position (Ref. nr. ADAPTFISH-3) The
complexity of angler behaviour constraint by ﬁshing
quality and ﬁshing regulations.
1 PhD student position (Ref. nr. ADAPTFISH-4)
Modelling the ecological and evolutionary impact of
size-selective recreational ﬁshing.
1 PhD student position (Ref. nr. ADAPTFISH-5) In-
ducing phenotypic and genetic changes in an experi-
mentally harvested ﬁsh stock.
1 PhD student position (Ref. nr. ADAPTFISH-6) Ef-
fects of angling on reproductive output and ﬁtness in
ﬁsh.
ADAPTFISH aims at analysing recreational ﬁsheries
from both a social scientiﬁc and biological perspective
including development of integrative models investigat-
ing the interaction between anglers and the ecological
systems. The ultimate goals of ADAPTFISH are to fa-
cilitate understanding of the complexity of ﬁsh-angler-
interactions, the angler behaviour per se and the poten-
tial biological impacts of angling and to derive manage-
ment implications than can improve ﬁsheries manage-
ment in the future. PhD students and the post doc will
in principle be based in Berlin (Germany). However,
several national and international partners are part of
the program and students and the post doc will be
working closely with these partners in their home insti-
tutes depending on the speciﬁc project’s aims. There-
fore, international applications are highly welcome to
this truly interdisciplinary and international opportu-
nity. This will ensure that the idea of interdisciplinary
and internationality will ﬂourish for the beneﬁts of the
students’ work and the advancement of recreational
ﬁsheries science. It is also possible, depending on thestudent’s background and network, to establish new col-
laborations and host the people at least temporarily
outside Berlin. It is also conceivable that students at-
tend a Ph.D. programme at an international university,
but answer research questions from Germany. In this
case, signiﬁcant travelling will be involved, for which
some funds are available as well. The current partners
of ADAPTFISH that serve as supervisor of the students

CoalescentTheory
DNAPolymorphism
Dear EvolDir Members,
I am analyzing mitochondrial DNA polymorphism in
a bivalve mollusk showing Doubly Uniparental Inher-
itance (i.e. transmission to progeny of two diﬀerent
mtDNAs, one by females and the other by males).
I need to analyze levels of polymorphism within the two
groups (male-type mtDNAs and female-type mtDNAs)
and see if there is any signiﬁcant diﬀerence between thetwo. I made this using a basic ANOVA on p-distances
(and it turned out to be signiﬁcant), but I wonder if
it is possible to apply Coalescent Theory and related
equations to my problem, to incorporate in my tests
stochastic and drift errors.
Does anyone have suggestions on the best statistic ap-
proach should I use? Is any software available for this
sort of analysis. Any help will be super-welcome!
Best wishes,

Control region ampliﬁcation answers
Dear Colleagues,
About 2 weeks ago I sent an email asking for sugges-
tion about how to amplify the diﬃcult control region.
I post the replies here (see below) since many people
sent me emails asking for that. Thanks to all who sent
comments.

Hi,
Try lowering the extension temperature to between 65
C and 68 C and using a high quality polymerase suitable
for long PCR. Many polymerases fall oﬀ after process-
ing just a few dozen residues. To continue extension,
another molecule has to bind. At the typical extension
temperature (72 C) the nascent strand can melt oﬀ the
template before another polymerase molecule can bind.
The long PCR polymerases are less likely to fall oﬀ.
I use a primer in tRNA-Met, TM-N201 5’ ACCTT-
TATAARTGGGGTATGARCC and one in 12S, such as
SR-J14610: 5’ ATAATAGGGTATCTAATCCTAGT44 EvolDir March 1, 2006
These give enough coding sequence to determine
whether you are actually amplifying the control region.
Good luck, Andy Beckenbach
————-
just a few suggestions: - Are you sure that your primers
ﬁt 100%? Do you have already a sequence from your
special beetle or only from related species? Just a few
mismatches in the hypervariable region could stop your
primers work. Don’t feel shy to use degenerate primers
if nothing else works - the control region is extremely
AT rich; not a good place for ampliﬁctions in general.
Try to slow down the reaction to improve conditions for
the Taq (low enzyme concentration, high dNTPs, opti-
mze Mg concentration between 1-10 mM) - check out
the AT content of your amplicon and make a dNTP mix
where A+T are overrepresented in the same relation;
otherwise your mix may depleted on free nucleotides in
the last cycles - make sure that your primers are rather
long ( >22 to 24 nt), with no secondary structures and
try to include a GC clamp at the 3’ end. FastPCR pro-
gram may help to ﬁnd suitable primers - anneal long
at rather low temp - maybe add a bit (1:10 to 1:40) of
a proofreading polymerase (Pwo, Pfu) to the Taq. In
this case use the buﬀer of the proofreading enzyme for
reaction
Good luck, Wolfgang
————
The control region can be very long in beetles (up to
13kb in bark weevils), due in part to the presence of
a highly repetitive region. This may explain the prob-
lems you have to amplify this region. If this is the
problem, you cannot just use a standard PCR proto-
col. You need a PCR protocol designed speciﬁcally to
amplify long fragments. Some kits are available. I have
successfully used the Long Expand PCR system from
Roche to amplify fragments of 5 to 9 kb, including the
control region of some leaf beetles species (see the at-
tached PDF). Note also that the presence of a repetitive
region makes it very diﬃcult to design primers to se-
quence the control region (due to the fact that a primer
designed within this repetitive region will anneal in dif-
ferent places). One way to get around the problem is
described in the attached article.
Patrick Mardulyn
——————
Hello Joan. Just a wild guess (sorry, I know nothing
of beetle genetics), but if your DNA preparation and
primers are both good then you may have a gene re-
arrangement on your hands (control regions sometimes
do this, for example in birds). Try longer PCRs span-ning where you think the control region is, then size the
fragment directly from on agarose gel. If the fragment
is much smaller then expected, your control has likely
migrated somewhere else in the genome. If the size is
what you expected, then I guess your control region
primers are not so good after all. Good luck. Joseph.
——————-
Hi Joan
You say that you have 100% matching, so presumably
you have something sequenced from a clone? I imag-
ine that you are using tRNA primers spanning Dloop,
and that there may have been a rearrangement and/or
inversion of the tRNA genes involved, precluding am-
pliﬁcation. The solution may be as simple as reversing
a primer- you need a map. Alternatively, you could
have large insertions and/or secondary structures that
the polymerase cannot cross.
good luck,
graham
—————-
Are you sure of the gene order for mtDNA in Pimelia?
Generally control region primers are anchored in the
transfer RNA sequences that bracket the control region
- if there’s been a rearrangement those tRNA sequences
may no longer be bracketing the control region as you
expect. If you’re reaasonably conﬁdent of the correct
gene order, you might use primers based on the brack-
eting coding genes such as cyt-b. Just a thought.
-Chris Wilson

Dear Joan I had the same problem with my butterﬂies
because it is an extremely AT rich region in insects.

Fecal DNA extraction kits
Dear EvolDir members,
I am trying to make a list of the “best” fecal DNA
extraction kits and protocols that people use for their
target non-human organisms. While it’s easy to ex-
tract DNA from fresh feces (up to 2 days old), older
feces tend to yield low-quality DNA, which is almost
impossible to amplify in some cases.
I am aware of phenol/CHCl3, Qiagen QIAamp Stool
Kit, and Epicentre ExtractMaster. Is there something
else or a combination/modiﬁcation of kits/methods
people use? For instance, diﬀerent kits/methods may
be suitable for elephant “leafy” dung or lagomorph or
goat dry pellets.
The compiled list will posted on EvolDir ASAP.

NED Dye Substitution answers
Hi, here is the list of all replies I got on my question
about the NED dye substitution. I am truly grateful
for all the answers - they were really helpfull. It seem
that it it possible to substitute NED with some other
dye..I will try it out soon.

...and the answers are:
Hi Tomasz,
The short answer is that the dyes you should choosedepend on what sequencing machine and ﬁlter set you
are using.
The ABI 3730 comes with a pre-installed ﬁlter called
the G5 Filter Set, which is set up for 6FAM (blue),
VIC (green), NED (yellow), PET (red) and LIZ (or-
ange, size standard). The ABI 3100 is similar, but is
set up with the D Filter Set which is FAM (blue), HEX
(green), NED (yellow) and ROX (red, size standard).
The ﬁlter sets are pieces of software that the instru-
ment writes during a calibration process - the emission
spectra of the dyes overlap quite a lot so the 3730 tries
to choose a wavelength to read each dye that minimizes
the ’background’ from the other dyes.
For the G5 ﬁlter set VIC, NED and PET are all pro-
prietary dyes so are only available from ABI (they are
quite expensive). It is possible to substitute VIC with
the much cheaper HEX but if you do this you won’t be
able to use NED. This is because HEX has a slightly
higher max emission than VIC, which causes HEX to
have spectral overlap with NED, so if you run HEX and
NED together with the G5 ﬁlter you will contaminate
your NED signal with signal from HEX - called “spec-
tral bleeding” or “pull-up” (we found this out the hard
way!).
Of course other ﬁlter sets may exist, and it is possible
to make a customized ﬁlter set, i.e. program the se-
quencer to read the diﬀerent dyes (such as what you
suggested, replacing NED with TAMRA - although we
have heard that TAMRA is a particularly bad dye) at
the most appropriate wavelengths for those dyes, which
is something you also could try. In the end, we stuck
with the dyes recommended by ABI for the G5 ﬁlter
set for use on the 3730 for our own AFLP studies. We
would probably recommend you do the same - the ABI
dyes may be more expensive but you could potentially
waste a lot of time and money trying to get the se-
quencer set up with diﬀerent dyes (and ABI warned us
that they might only be able to provide limited support
if we got ourselves into that situation).

Hi Tomasz, we have been dealing with the same is-
sue with a new ABI 3130xl. Several of the dyes we
use on the 310 are not supported by ABI for their
new machines. Their application specialist says that
TAMRA labeled samples should be run separately from
other dyes because of spectral overlap and possible peak
“pull-up” problems. However, we have recently been
running multiple dyes (HEX, 6-FAM, and Promega’s
CRX size standard - similar to ROX) with TAMRA
and have not had any problems. You might just give it
a go and see how the data look. Best regards, Rich

PopGenet PopDynamics
Dear All,
I face to questions which involve population genetics
and population dynamics.
It is assumed that only few migrants per generation
between two populations allow the homogenization of
their genetic pools so that no genetic diﬀerence is re-
vealed.
My questions are:
What these “few migrants” mean from a populationdynamic point of view?
Are they suﬃcient to inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the popu-
lations’ growth rates?
In broader view, is it justiﬁed to consider the deﬁnition
of a population (and so its conservation/management)
only from a genetic point of view?
I am conscious that my question is somewhat wide, but
I failed to ﬁnd relevant articles.
I would appreciate any comments, references, papers,
point of view.
Thanks
Best wishes,
Nicolas

>From Jeﬀ Markert
Dear Nicolas,
I think you ask some excellent questions in your evoldir
post, I’ll ﬁll you in on my conclusions from my struggles
with the same issue. I’m not sure I have a deﬁnite view
yet, and I would be interested to see what you learn
from your evoldir post.
First, the idea about homogenization of is an impor-
tant one. I believe there is a 1980’s paper by Slatkin
that suggests even one migrant every second genera-
tion is suﬃcient to prevent populations from diverging
through genetic drift alone. There are at least two im-
portant caveats:
One is that selection could act diﬀerently in the two
populations, and could lead to divergence in both phe-notypes and marker loci even with low or moderate
levels of gene ﬂow. It’s basically a balancing act be-
tween the homogenizing eﬀects of gene exchange and
the diﬀerentiating eﬀects of selection.
The second is that if two populations start out as
separate gene pools and then for some reason start
exchanging migrants, then they will become homoge-
neous. However the time it takes for them to become
the same (expressed in generations) is proportional to
the number of individuals. For insects or other animals
with very high population sizes, the eﬀects of moder-
ate levels of gene ﬂow can be insigniﬁcant because it
would take so long for homogeneity to be restored that
the biogeographic scenario would often be quite likely
to change over that time period.
The eﬀect of migration on population dynamics is an
important one. A
good place to start exploring this might be a paper
by Westemeier et al (Science 282 pp 1695) on the ge-
netic rescue of some genetically depauperate popula-
tions. We discussed this paper in a course last year,
and I came away wondering whether the “rescue” eﬀect
was entirely due to a change in the genetics, or due to a
change in the demographics because additional individ-
uals were added to the population. It’s likely both, but
since you can’t do controlled experiments on endan-
gered populations it would be diﬃcult to disentangle
the genetic eﬀects from population dynamics outside of
the laboratory. I wonder whether there might be an
experimental conservation genetics literature on this.
The obvious experiment to do would be to set up sev-
eral genetically impoverished populations. To some you
add genetic diversity by putting in an unrelated indi-
vidual and removing one of the individuals from the
impoverished population. You also add impoverished

Tim, I don’t have software or know of anything partic-
ular, though there is probably something in the Eco-
logical arena, where they have the “species richness”
analogue to contend with. There are, as far as I can
see, two aspects to the problem. The ﬁrst is whether
what we see in two samples is comparable or really dif-
ferent. The second is how well the two measures capture
what is really there. The second problem is probably
the more challenging and interesting,
but the ﬁrst is fairly easy to attack. Imagine a pair of
populations of sizes N1 and N2, respectively, preferably
but not necessarily the same. In the ﬁrst population,
allelic richness is K alleles, with counts of n11, n12, .
. . , n1K, summing to N1. In the second population,
we see L alleles, with counts of n21, n22, . . . , n2L,
summing to N2. Now, the question is whether K and L
are really diﬀerent, or whether the apparent diﬀerence
is just a consequence of drawing two samples, of sizes
N1 and N2 from the same “pool”.
If we take the view that “the data are the data, and
anything else is extrapolation,” then we might be in-clined to conduct a resampling exercise, using only the
data at hand, randomly shuﬄing the N = N1 + N2 alle-
les between the two populations, without replacement,
and in numbers N1 and N2 allocated to the two pseudo-
populations, on the null premise that both populations
are drawing from the same pool. We simply count K
and L from the two (constructed) pseudo-populations,
or perhaps (K/N1) and (L/N2), if N1 and N2 are very
diﬀereent, and compute the diﬀerence (or some deriva-
tive translation of that diﬀerence), and tally it. We
then shuﬄe again, record the criterion of interest, and
do it again. With (say) 999 random trials, to which we
add the observed data outcome (on the premise that
it too is the result of a random draw from a common
pool), we have constructed a null distribution of our
chosen criterion, against which to compare the actual
result. The whole thing is conditioned on the data we
actually have, and never mind what we have not seen.
I suspect, on the basis of accumulated experience, that
the common alleles will be recovered in both popula-
tions, and that the precise allocation of the rarer alleles
will be unpredictable. Typical sampling stuﬀ. You may
ﬁnd a program that does this, but my guess would be
that you could set it up as an Excel routine. Many years
ago, the Michigan team published a paper on thousands
of genetic samples from Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
Neel JV, Satoh C, Smouse PE, Asakawa J, Takahashi
N, Goriki K, Fujita M, Kageoka T and Hazama R. 1988.
Protein variants in Hiroshima and Nagasaki: Tales of
two cities. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 43:870-893,
the point of which was not “allelic richness” per se, but
the samples were so large that they were instructive
about the sampling aspects of the problem. The com-
mon alleles were shared, but the really rare alleles, say
those in frequencies <0.001, were virtually unique to
the two cities. Of course, with our more typical sam-
ple sizes of (say) 50-100 individuals, we would never
have seen these alleles at all. When we subsampled,
the relatively common alleles survived, but the really
rare alleles (p <0.001) and most of the unusual alle-
les (say p <0.01) dropped out of the sample. Typical
rarifaction result.
Several years later, working with colleagues on mtDNA
haplotypes from marine ﬁsh, we encountered a simi-
lar problem, but there the sample sizes were (for single
populations) on the order of N = 100 per population,
and the total (N1 + N2 + . . . + N17) was on the
order of 1000 or so. There, haplotypic richness was at
least part of the issue,

and we discovered that by doubling the total sample
size, we added large numbers of rare haplotypes, the
majority of which had not been seen in the previous
sample. The common haplotypes were recovered again,
and in roughly the same frequencies. Some of the un-
common haplotypes, seen perhaps once or twice in the
ﬁrst sample, showed up again (once or twice) in the
second sample.
Today, this is well-traveled territory. There are stan-
dard measures of expected allelic richness, with increas-
ing sample size, but they usually require some way to
determine the parametric frequencies of the

Another reply to my question regarding signiﬁcance
testing of allelic richness:
Doing a straightforward permutation test by randomis-
ing alleles among samples is not useful when you want
to test a diversity index such as the allelic richness.
The reason for that is that the alleles may or may not
be comparable between populations, and this inﬂuences
the test. A test between populations with richnesses 10
and 20 that share a lot of the alleles, will likely give
a diﬀerent result than a test between populations with
richnesses 10 and 20 that have no alleles in common. In
the latter case, the average richnes after randomisation
is likely to be even higher than 20, the maximum of the
two populations.
It is however possible to do a bootstrap test, though
this also has some (smaller) complications. See Thomas
MG, Weale ME, Jones AL, et al. (2002) Founding
mothers of Jewish communities: Geographically sep-
arated Jewish groups were independently founded by
very few female ancestors. American Journal of Hu-
man Genetics 70, 1411-1420.
I wrote a small app (GenoDive) to test for diﬀerences in
diversity between pairs of populations, it does not cal-
culate allelic richness (though that probably depends on
your deﬁnition of allelic richness) but some other indicesof diversity like Nei’s (=Simpson’s) index and the Shan-
non (=Wiener/Weiner) index. The program was not
made for allelic data, but for clonal genotypes, though it
can handle alleles if you just code every allele as a geno-
type (with an added assumption of HW-equilibrium as
that breaks down the conenction between the two alle-
les at a locus).

SSB GraduateStudent
ResearchAwards
Awards for Graduate Student Research
The Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) announces
its ﬁfth annual Graduate Student Research Award com-
petition. The purpose of these awards is to assist stu-
dents in the initiation (ﬁrst two years) of their system-
atics projects and in the collection of preliminary data
needed by them to pursue additional sources of sup-
port (e.g., Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants
from the National Science Foundation) or to enhance
dissertation research (e.g., by visiting additional ﬁeld
collection sites or museums). Applicants may be from
any country, but must be members of SSB, and are ad-
vised to join the Society as soon as possible to facilitate
their applications (to join go to: http://systbiol.org/-
join.html ). Previous awardees may not re-apply, but
previous applicants who were not selected for funding
are encouraged to re-apply. Awards will range between
$1,000 and $2,000 and up to six awards will be made.
All applications materials this year must be in elec-
tronic format. Applicants and their recommenders are
strongly encouraged to use pdf format, rather than56 EvolDir March 1, 2006
Word or some other application, to minimize diﬃculties
in ﬁle transfer. We strongly recommend that applicants
send all materials (except letters of reference) in a sin-
gle pdf ﬁle. Letters of recommendation should be sent
separately by the referees in pdf format or in the text
of an e-mail; please include the full name of applicant
in letters of recommendation.
Applicants must submit 1) a curriculum vitae (one
page) 2) brief research proposal including objectives,
methods, signiﬁcance, and schedule (max. three single-
spaced pages including literature cited and any ﬁgures
and tables) 3) budget and budget justiﬁcation (1 page)
4) and arrange for two letters of recommendation; one
letter must be from the student’s current graduate ad-
visor.
The research proposal must clearly state the current
stage of the proposed research and the current year
and status of the student. Please include e-mail con-
tacts for the applicant in the application itself. Both
Masters and Ph.D. students are eligible. Systematics
is interpreted broadly to include questions below and
above the species level, molecular and morphological
approaches, and issues of pattern and process. Funding
is not limited to any particular aspect of research, but
rather is available for ﬁeld, museum/herbarium, and/or
laboratory work.
Please email all application materials and queries to Dr.
Kelly Zamudio at krz2@cornell.edu
To be considered for this year’s award, application ma-
terials, including letters of recommendation, must be
received electronically no later than March 31, 2006.
To ensure that applications are not lost in electronic
transfer, the awards chair will send each applicant a
conﬁrmation e-mail. If you do not receive this conﬁr-
mation within 3 days of your submission, please contact
the awards chair to arrange for re-submission.

SSB Mini-PEET awardsSociety of Systematic Biologists Mini-PEET awards to
enhance transfer of taxonomic knowledge
SSB is pleased to announce the availability of awards
to enhance the transfer of taxonomic expertise, mod-
eled after the highly successful PEET program at NSF.
Unlike the NSF PEET program, awards will not be lim-
ited to taxonomically understudied taxa; the primary
purpose of this program is to pass on taxonomic exper-
tise in general. The awards are designed to allow SSB
members (students, post-docs, and faculty) to spend
a summer or semester apprenticed to an expert in a
particular taxonomic group. This would support the
PEET goal of passing on taxonomic expertise before it
is lost. Activities can include a trip to the taxonomists’
laboratory, or pay for the taxonomist to visit the ap-
plicants’ laboratory for a period of time. Requests for
support may be in any amount up to $4,000.
Applicants may be from any country, but must be mem-
bers of SSB, and are advised to join the Society as soon
as possible to facilitate their applications (to join go to:
http://systbiol.org/join.html ).
A complete application includes a brief description of
the project, justiﬁcation of the importance of the taxon,
an itemized budget, the applicant’s CV, and a letter of
support from the taxonomic expert. If the applicant
is a student or post-doc, please also include a letter of
recommendation. The total request application should
be no more than two pages long, not including the cur-
riculum vitae and letters of support.
Requests should be sent to Dr. Kelly R. Zamudio, SSB
Award Committee Chair, at krz2@cornell.edu
E-mail submissions are required, and applicants are en-
couraged to use pdf format for all documents.
Application deadline is March 31, 2006.
To ensure that applications are not lost in electronic
transfer, the awards chair will send each applicant a
conﬁrmation e-mail. If you do not receive this conﬁr-
mation within 3 days of your submission, please contact
the awards chair to arrange for re-submission.

SSB TravelAwards IntlScholars
Scholarships and travel awards for scientists from devel-
oping countries to obtain modern systematics training
in the United States
SSB is pleased to announce the availability of schol-
arships for scholars from developing countries to at-
tend workshops and courses in systematics, or to visit
a lab engaged in systematic research for training. The
emphasis of this program is the transfer of knowledge
to the scholar’s home country. Therefore, applicants
should currently be in their home country or have deﬁ-
nite plans to return in the near future. Courses such as
the Molecular Evolution Workshop at Woods Hole and
the applied Systematics Course at Bodega Bay are ex-
amples of courses that are appropriate for this funding,
in addition to other equivalent opportunities. Support
for attending a course will be contingent on admission
to the course through the normal admissions process.
Applicants should submit a CV, and a letter detailing
how the knowledge acquired will be transferred to their
country of origin, a justiﬁcation of the course or lab
visit as providing appropriate training, and one letter
of recommendation from a researcher familiar with the
scholar’s work.
Applications should be sent to Dr. Kelly R. Zamudio,
SSB Award Committee Chair, at krz2@cornell.edu
E-mail submissions are required, and applicants are en-
couraged to use pdf format for all documents.
Application deadline is March 31, 2006
To ensure that applications are not lost in electronic
transfer, the awards chair will send each applicant a

Software Geneious
SOFTWARE: for organizing sequences, alignments,phylogenetics trees and abstracts
We have recently released a new software system
(Geneious version 0.9e) which allows evolutionary biol-
ogists to easily manage their data and access web-based
databases such as NCBI. It also integrates several core
tasks that are essential for evolutionary biologists to
perform quickly, often and easily, including
* phylogenetic reconstruction (NJ with bootstrapping)
* tree viewing * pairwise sequence alignment * multi-
ple sequence alignment * dot plots * sequence viewing,
including sequence annotations from NCBI database *
translating from DNA to amino acids * export to End-
note, Nexus, Newick, Fasta * import trees, sequences
alignments and bibliographies in a variety of formats *
adding user information and notes to sequences, align-
ments and trees
The novel thing about this software is that for the ﬁrst
time these tasks can now be done in an integrated way
using a tool that also allows local database storage
and retrieval of all sequences, proteins, and research
publications in formats including PDF. The result is
that much of the drudgery of downloading, sorting and
analysing sequences is now streamlined, so that you can
spend more time on genuine research. The other major
innovation is that any existing bioinformatics applica-
tions that you are using can be rapidly integrated into
the product so that your workﬂow becomes even faster.
- Signiﬁcantly increases your chance of ﬁnding the re-
search paper you are looking for - in minutes, not hours
- and being automatically told when new ones come
in - Organise, search, and perform non-exact searches
through all PDF- format research publications for key-
words - By creating a well-organised searchable, contin-
uously updating local database of sequences, you can
perform much more complicated searches and analyses
much quicker than if you had to search from scratch on
the whole of NCBI and/or EBI each time
You can download Geneious without charge at
www.geneious.com . Versions for Mac OS X, Windows
and Linux are available.
Geneious will grow as we continue to build new tools
through open- source upgrades and new features. We
will plan to focus special attention on developing analy-
sis tools for sequence alignment and phylogenetics and
welcome any and all feedback on current and future
features in the product.
Biomatters plans to release version 1.0 of Geneious in
Q2 2006.

Software Notung 2 1
Dear Colleagues,
It is our pleasure to announce the release of Notung
2.1, a software tool that provides a uniﬁed framework
for incorporating duplication/loss parsimony in phy-
logenetic tasks. Notung can be obtained at http://-March 1, 2006 EvolDir 59
www.cs.cmu.edu/˜durand/Notung/ Given a gene tree
and a species tree as input, Notung can
- Reconcile a gene tree with a species tree,
- Estimate upper and lower bounds on gene duplication
times in terms of speciation events,
- Root an unrooted tree by minimizing gene duplica-
tions and losses,
- Rearrange regions of a gene tree with weak support
in the sequence data to obtain alternate hypotheses.
The structure of regions with strong support remains
unchanged.
Notung’s graphical user interface supports exploratory
data analysis of very large trees and rapid review of a
large number of alternate hypotheses. Notung also pro-
vides a command-line interface for automated analysis
of many trees in high-throughput genomic studies.
URL: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/˜durand/Notung/ DIS-
TRIBUTION: Notung is freely available and runs on
Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. The distribution in-
cludes the Notung executable, a manual in PDF format
with worked examples, sample gene and species trees,
and sample scripts for automated analysis of trees.
PLATFORMS: Mac OS X 10.3 and above; Windows
2000 and Windows XP; Linux. Java 1.4 or higher must
be installed.
FILE FORMATS: Notung can read and save trees in
Newick, NHX, or Notung ﬁle format. Notung can also
output images in PNG format for use as ﬁgures in pub-
lications.
AUTHORS: Notung was written by Benjamin Vernot,
Aiton Goldman, and Dannie Durand. It uses a novel,
fast algorithm by Durand, Halldorsson, and Vernot [1],
and is based on an approach ﬁrst presented in Chen,
Durand, and Farach-Colton [2]. Notung is implemented
in Java and makes use of the tree visualization library
provided by FORESTER (version 1.92) [3].

Software Selection server
It is our pleasure to announce the release of
version 2.0 of the Selecton server, at http://-
selecton.bioinfo.tau.ac.il .
The Selecton server is a server for the identiﬁcation of
selection forces acting upon proteins [1]. This is done
by estimating the degree of positive Darwinian selec-
tion and purifying selection at each site. Positively se-
lected sites may be interpreted as being a consequence
of molecular adaptation, which confers an evolutionary
advantage to the organism
Given a ﬁle of coding sequences, Selecton can:
- compute Ka/Ks scores - project the score on the lin-
ear sequence. This enables the detection of blocks of
similarly evolving sites - project the scores on the 3-
dimensional structure (if available). This enables the
detection of patches of similarly evolving sites
AVAILABILITY The server is freely available
at http://selecton.bioinfo.tau.ac.il <http://-
selecton.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/ >.
METHOD (in brief): The server implements both a
Bayesian [2] as well as a Maximum likelihood [3] ap-
proach. The user may choose between the two methods.
Both methods explicitly take into account the phyloge-
netic relations among the sequences and the underlying
stochastic process of evolution.
INPUT: (1) The input may consist of a ﬁle of coding se-
quences, either non-aligned, or codon-aligned. (2) PDB
ID or PDB ﬁle (if available)
OUTPUT: (1) Projection of the color-coded Ka/Ks
scores on the linear sequence (and 3D if available) (2)
Actual Ka/Ks scores of each site (3) Amino acid mul-
tiple sequence alignment (4) Codon multiple sequence
alignment (5) Phylogenetic tree

of the American grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis on
the genetic identity of the European squirrel, Sciurus
vulgaris, in Italy, we are looking for samples of S. car-
olinensis from America, and S. vulgaris from European
locations, preferentially from south-eastern Europe.
Hairs with bulbs plucked from the tail and/or dorsal
area and stored in pure ethanol or tissue samples, as
well as museum specimens are welcome. In exchange,
we can provide samples from our geographic area. All
contributors will be acknowledged by name in eventual
outcoming publications of this project.

Storing DNA
Hello,
I have extracted DNA from ﬁshscales using the method
described in Elphinstone et al. (2004) (**and below). I
have encountered a problem where the extracted DNA
(dissolved in water) apparently degrades after being
stored (+4 and -20) for about 12-15 months. I was
wondering if any of you might have good tips and infor-
mation how to prolong the preservation time of DNA.How long can I expect the DNA to preserve in +4, -20
or -80? Should I use buﬀer like 0,2M TE instead of
water to dissolve the DNA in or perhaps some other
buﬀer or concentration?
**The mthod is based on the binding of DNA to sil-
ica beads under chaotropic salt conditions, vacuum is
applied to remove unwanted liquids, few washing steps
with some solvents and ﬁnally the DNA is detached
from silica beads and eluted with water.
Thanks Juha-Pekka

Many of you may know Wikipedia, the free on-line en-
cyclopedia. You may also know that anyone can edit
and add to it.
This is just what a number of us (mostly grad students,
postdocs and assistant professors) have done for a few
months, or in some cases longer. Speciﬁcally, we have
recently created a number of navigation templates that
are like tables of content for mini-textbooks.
The following evolution-related templates are available
so far. The topics are not yet covered exhaustively or
with complete intellectual rigour (if you ﬁnd any lack
of precision or detail, please ﬁx it!), but you may wantMarch 1, 2006 EvolDir 61
to judge for yourselves whether you ﬁnd any of the be-
low useful as supplementary resources for ﬁrst year stu-
dents.

Wikipedia content is a well-studied problem with a few
well-established solutions. Generally, a defacing edit of
a page will not last more than ﬁve minutes - at any
time of day or night, there will be many wikipedians
active in checking any recent changes, and undoing any
changes that seem incorrect.
There are, however, some pages that are so zealously
protected that it is diﬃcult to make a contribution.
A Wikipedia stable version, or Wikipedia 1.0, is also
being prepared. I expect it may get ﬁnished within the
next three years.

oilseed rape (/Brassica napus/, AACC) of which we dis-
pose of newly synthesized amphiploids resulting from
independent AA (/B. rapa/) ×CC (/B. oleracea/)
crosses (INRA Rennes). Comparative proteomics per-
formed on early generations of theses synthetic lines
led to the observation of numerous non-additive pat-
terns. Identiﬁcations of the corresponding proteins are
in progress, using mass spectrometry. The applicant
will have to: 1/ determine, using quantitative PCR,
at which level (during or after transcription) the mod-
iﬁcations of gene expression occur; 2/ study the ori-
gins of various isoforms (gene family products? post-
translational modiﬁcations?); 3/ evaluate the implica-
tion of epigenetic mechanisms (methylation, transpos-

(evolutionary) genomic analyses of interest to the suc-
cessful candidate (negotiable; to be determined). Ap-
plicants must have a Ph.D. (or equivalent), with em-
phasis in genetics, genomics, computational biology, or
related disciplines, and possess strong computational
skills. A background in bioinformatic analysis, evolu-
tionary genomics, molecular evolution, statistical ge-
netics, or functional genomics would be desirable, and
proﬁciency with basic molecular biology/genetics labo-
ratory skills would be a deﬁnite advantage. The project
is centered in the laboratory of Dr. Paul B. Samol-
low, Department to Veterinary Integrative Biosciences,
Texas A&M University (TAMU), with collaborative as-
pects at the University of Pittsburgh (UPG).
RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES:–Speciﬁc objectives
of the supporting grant are to establish an EST
database for use in empirical annotation of the
M. domestica genome sequence, designing of a
set of cDNA-based oligonucleotide microarrays for
expression-proﬁling studies, and using these arrays in
proof-of-principal studies of phenotypes controlled by
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to diet-induced
serum lipoprotein responses in this species. The suc-
cessful candidate will participate in cDNA library de-
sign and construction, and will take a leading role in
EST data analysis and database development, anno-
tation of the M. domestica genome, and comparative
analysis of this genome to those of other vertebrates.
The exact nature of these comparative analyses and the
level of participation in the design of oligonucleotide mi-
croarrays and the expression- proﬁling studies will be
determined largely by the interests of the candidate.
Other research foci in the laboratory include compara-
tive analyses of the structure and functional character-
istics of the marsupial MHC and other immune-related
gene families, and use of linkage and physical genome
data to examine the unusual patterns of meiotic re-
combination seen in M. domestica (strongly reduced
female recombination) as a means to detect molecular
features that inﬂuence the distribution and rates of mei-
otic chromosome exchange in the genomes of M. domes-
tica and other vertebrate species. The successful candi-
date will be welcome to join in these ongoing projects,
or to develop alternative studies in the general area of
vertebrate genomic analysis, according to her/his in-
terests. Opportunities also exist for interaction with
a large group of vertebrate genomicists and quantita-
tive geneticists in the College of Veterinary Medicine
at TAMU, and with collaborators in the Departments
of Human Genetics and Computational Biology at the
UPG, to develop skills in the analysis of quantitative
genetic and gene mapping data.

UAdelaide InterorganellarTransfer
Postdoctoral Position - Interorganellar Transposition of
DNA; University of Adelaide, Australia
A Postdoctoral position is available immediately to
conduct research on the interorganellar transposition
of DNA using the Chlamydomonas and tobacco
systems. The movement of DNA between organelles is
established as a major driving force in eukaryotic evo-
lution. In yeast, about 75% of all nuclear genes derive
from protomitochondria, while 4,500 nuclear genes of
Arabidopsis are plastid derived. Whereas it appears
that DNA transfer per se continues in all higher cells,
in many eukaryotes the functional transfer of genes is
now rare or has stopped, but it continues at a high
rate in higher plants, giving them unique potential
in evolutionary genome studies. We have established
experimentally that DNA moves frequently from the
plastid (chloroplast) genome to the nucleus. The main
aims of this project are to determine the mechanism of
transfer and to measure the frequency of transposition
of DNA from the plastid to the mitochondrion. The
position requires experience in standard molecular
biology techniques and, preferably, experience with
Chlamydomonas culture. The position will be held
in the laboratories of Professor Jeremy Timmis and
Dr. Jack da Silva in the School of Molecular and
Biomedical Science. This research is funded by a grant

Salary £20,044 to £25,565 per annum Ref: RA251
A NERC funded postdoctoral position is available from
March 2006 for a period of three years (the ﬁrst 1.5years based at UEA and the second 1.5 years at Ox-
ford). The goal of the research is to establish the role of
the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in sex-
ual selection in birds, using the red junglefowl, Gallus
gallus, and its domestic subspecies, G. g. domesticus,
as model systems. The researcher will help develop a
molecular protocol to screen for MHC variation and
then use this to; (i) determine the extent to which
sexual selection is MHC-mediated under natural con-
ditions, and, (ii) to experimentally identify the mech-
anisms of pre- and post-insemination sexual selection
through which the MHC inﬂuences variation in pater-
nity.
Applicants must have, or be about to obtain, a PhD
in a relevant discipline such as evolutionary or molec-
ular ecology and have a keen interest in sexual selec-
tion and sperm competition. Practical experience in
modern molecular techniques, such a PCR, cloning and
sequencing, is essential. Field experience/animal han-
dling will also be a beneﬁt.
The project will be undertaken jointly at UEA and
Oxford. At UEA, the researcher will be based with
Dr D.S Richardson in the School of Biological Sciences
(RAE 5-rated), and will be part of the Centre for Ecol-
ogy, Evolution and Conservation (CEEC). The school
and research centre provide excellent research facili-
ties and a stimulating and dynamic research environ-
ment. Further information about the school can be

UJena FloralEvoDevo
2 PhD positions or 1 Postdoc position
In our group we have openings for two graduate stu-
dents or one Postdoc with strong interest in the evolu-
tionary developmental biology of plants. The project
focuses on the evolution of the interaction of ﬂoral
homeotic proteins (MADS-domain proteins) by inte-
grating experimental and bioinformatic approaches.
Floral homeotic proteins of higher eudicotyledonous
ﬂowering plants are key determinants of ﬂoral organ
identity. They exert their function by constituting mul-
timeric complexes that bind to cis-regulatory DNA sites
in their target genes. We wonder how this situation
originated during evolution by studying evolutionary
informative taxa such as gymnosperms and basal ﬂow-
ering plants. Given the enormous importance of ﬂoral
homeotic proteins and their interaction behaviour for
ﬂower development in eudicots, unraveling the evolu-
tionary trajectories that led to the present day inter-
action network may help to elucidate the origin of the
angiosperm ﬂower - still on of the most enigmatic ques-
tions in biology.
In the experimental part of the project, interactions
of ﬂoral homeotic proteins are studied by “wet lab
techniques” such as gel retardation assays, the yeast-
2/3/4-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation as-
says. Candidates applying for this part of the project
should have a Diploma or Master degree in Biology,
Biochemistry or related ﬁelds. Experience in the tech-
niques mentioned above is of advantage, but not ab-
solutely required. Demonstrable practical experience
in standard molecular biology techniques, including
molecular cloning is essential, however.
In the bioinformatics part of the project, the question
is addressed as to whether protein-protein interactions
aﬀect the rates of protein evolution. Candidates apply-ing for this part of the project should have a Diploma
or Master degree in Bioinformatics, Biochemistry, Bi-
ology or related ﬁelds, and should have demonstrable
experience with methods of phylogeny reconstruction
(e.g. Neighbor Joining, Maximum Likelihood, Maxi-
mum Parsimony) using sequence data, and profound
knowledge of Molecular Evolution methods.
Postdocs applying for the position should be prepared
to work in both parts of the project. Candidates will be
considered on a competitive basis and only applications
containing all the required documents will be reviewed.
Applicants will be considered from 1st of March 2006
until the positions are ﬁlled. Interested candidates
should send the following, preferably as PDF ﬁles via
e-mail:
1. A statement detailing your research experience and
scientiﬁc interests.

Post Doctoral position available in the Department of
Genetics, University of Stellenbosch (1 Feb 2006)
A Post Doctoral position in molecular genetics is avail-
able in the Aquaculture Division, Department of Ge-
netics, Stellenbosch University with the project title
“Genetic improvement of the abalone, Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the Western, Southern and Eastern shores of
South Africa and is the only one of the six species that
occurs in South Africa that is commercially exploited.
H. midae displays a very slow growth rate, taking two
to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an obstacle
in the proﬁtable farming and global competitiveness of
this species. In order to increase the productivity and
the proﬁtability of the commercial activity, a research
program has been designed that makes use of the mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. The research program consists of three main
tears: a) establishment of breeding programs with the
assistance of genetic markers, b) generation of linkage
maps and QTL identiﬁcation, c) and the application ofgene transfer technology.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for developing AFLP markers in the abalone species,
Haliotis midae. AFLPs have been developed in only
one other Haliotis species. Together with other genetic
markers such as microsatellites and SNPs, these AFLP
markers will eventually be used to generate the ﬁrst ge-
netic linkage map for Haliotis midae. Candidates must
have a strong background in molecular genetics with
applicable knowledge in the development and analysis
of AFLP markers. Practical experience with the ba-
sic molecular techniques required for AFLP generation
such as DNA isolation, primer-labelling, PCR, poly-
acrylamide gel-electrophoreses and a sound knowledge
of AFLP analysis or related software is a prerequisite.
Experience with radioactive isotope handling and ex-
perience with mapping or linkage analysis software will
be a strong recommendation. The position is available
for 2 years
Interested researchers are requested to send their CV
to Dr. Rouvay Roodt-Wilding at roodt@sun.ac.za

UppsalaU ComparativeGenomics
POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP AT UPPSALA
UNIVERSITY
A postdoctoral fellowship is immediately available to
study Comparative Genomics of Diplomonads at the
Department of Cell and Molecular Biology (ICM), Upp-
sala University, Sweden. The position is within the Pro-
tist Genome Evolution group, and will be in collabora-
tion with Staﬀan Sv¨ ard’s group at ICM, and Bj¨ orn An-
dersson’s group at the Department of Cell and Molec-
ular Biology at Karolinska Institutet.
Diplomonads is a group of heterotrophic, mostly bacte-
riovorous ﬂagellates found in micro-aerophilic environ-
ments, which include human and ﬁsh pathogens (i. e.78 EvolDir March 1, 2006
Giardia lamblia and Spironucleus barkhanus), as well
as free-living and endocommensal species. We have
previously shown that diplomonads have adapted to
their environment by gene acquisitions from prokary-
otes (e.g. Curr Biol 13, 94-104) and identiﬁed diﬀer-
ences in codon usage and mutational patterns within
the group (manuscript in preparation). Our collabora-
tors have interests in diplomonad cell biology (Sv¨ ard),
and genome analysis of parasites (Andersson).
The project will use a comparative genomics approach
to study the cell biology and evolution of diplomonads.
Isolates from diverse environments will be cultivated,
and expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries will be cre-
ated and sequenced randomly. Genomic similarities
and diﬀerences within diplomonads will be identiﬁed
using a variety of bioinformatic approaches, including
phylogenomic analyses. This approach may be comple-
mented with biochemical studies. Particular question
that could be addressed include whether there are dif-
ferences between lineages in the patterns of gene ac-
quisitions from prokaryotes, and if gene exchange with
other eukaryotes occurs.

Students are urged to apply for travel funds from their
home institutions. If such funds are not available, all
travel expenses beyond the ﬁrst $400 will be reimbursed
completely, regardless of the country of origin. Students
are responsible for meal expenses. Additional funding
for students from outside of the United States, Canada,
and Western Europe may be provided. There are no
other charges of any kind, and no other major expenses
are likely.
Participating students should be in the early stages of
their own research in paleontology. They should have
a background in basic statistics, and preferably also
programming. The course is open to all students, but
ﬁrst or second year graduate students are particularly
encouraged to apply, as are international students. Ap-
plications from professionals who have completed their
studies will be considered, but strong preference will be
given to students.
Applications should be submitted in PDF form to John
Alroy (alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu) no later than March 1st.
Applications should consist of a one page statement,
plus a recommendation letter written by the student’s
academic advisor and e-mailed separately. No form
needs to be ﬁlled out. The statement should include
a description of current research plans, a list of rele-
vant classes taken and degrees earned, and an account
of the student’s background in statistics and program-
ming. Applicants are encouraged to explain why the
topics addressed by the course are of special interest to
them, and which of these subjects are taught at their
home institutions.

UEdinburgh QuantGenetics
MSc in QUANTITATIVE GENETICS AND
GENOME ANALYSIS UNIVERSITY OF EDIN-
BURGH http://www.qgen.co.uk This full-time degree
programme (12 months M.Sc./ 9 months Diploma)
starts each September and provides a solid foundation
in population and quantitative genetics together with
experience in relevant statistical methodologies. It
includes options in evolutionary genetics , human
genetics and animal breeding. There is a growing need
for individuals with these combined strengths to apply
quantitative genetics theory to practical problems in
both the biomedical and agricultural industries; and to
undertake research on current problems in population
genetics, genome analysis, and analysis of complex
traits. This Masters course is an excellent platform for
doctoral studies.
The course is based at the Institute of Evolution-
ary Biology http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/-
institutes/evolution/ with substantial input of teach-
ing and research facilities provided by the Roslin Insti-
tute, Scottish Agricultural College, the Medical Genet-ics Section of the Department of Medical Sciences, and
the MRC Human Genetics Unit. These are all interna-
tionally recognised centres for research in quantitative
genomics and research training is an integral part of the
course.
**STUDENTSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR SELECTED
APPLICANTS **
The course has a number of scholarships open to UK ap-
plicants and other EU nationals. Details are at http:/-
/www.qgen.co.uk . Studentships will be awarded on a
competitive basis.
We welcome applications from able graduates (expected
2.1 or higher) in either
1. Biosciences, Genetics, Agricultural Sciences,
Medicine or Veterinary Medicine who have an interest
in, and aptitude for quantitative biology, or
2. Mathematics, Statistics or Physical Sciences who
wish to apply theory to genetic problems.
Closing date for applications 31 March 2006 but earlier
applications welcome.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category84 EvolDir March 1, 2006
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
