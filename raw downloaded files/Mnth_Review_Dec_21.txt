CIGENE AquacultureGenomics
Nov10
Hi all,
We are pleased to introduce the next speaker for
CIGENE seminars: Professor Ross Houston, PersonalChair of Aquaculture Genetics, The Roslin Institute,
University of Edinburgh, will present:
Applications of genomics to expedite genetic improve-
ment in aquaculture species
Abstract: The potential to grow aquaculture produc-
tion via informed use of selective breeding and genomic
technologies is huge, due to the relatively recent do-
mestication and high fecundity of most species. In the
more advanced, high value aquaculture sectors such as
Atlantic salmon, genomic selection is routinely applied
to increase selection accuracy and therefore cumulative
genetic gain. This has been enabled by the develop-
ment of high density SNP arrays and genotyping by
sequencing technologies. To translate these benets to
many other aquaculture species, lower cost solutions are
required, such as combined-purpose low density SNP
panels with genotype imputation.
In parallel, high quality annotated reference genomes
and functional genomic assays to prole transcriptional
regulation can now be utilised to prioritise putative
causative variants in genomic regions associated with
traits of economic interest. Such variants can poten-
tially be harnessed to improve the accuracy of genomic
prediction, and persistency of that accuracy in more
distant relatives. Genome editing (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9)
can be used to demonstrate the causality of these vari-
ants, and also has potential for the 'introgression' of
favourable alleles from other strains or species, or the
informed generation of de novo alleles, including via the
application of genome-wide CRISPR screens.
This presentation will describe some examples of ap-
plied genomic and genome editing research aiming to
take steps towards improvements in aquaculture breed-
ing and production, with a focus on disease resistance.

Online CIGEN HumanMigration
Nov17
Hi all,
We invite you to the next CIGENE seminar. The presen-
ter is Hie Lim Kim, Assistant Professor at Asian School
of the Environment, Nanyang Technological University,
Singapore Title: Human back migration out of Sunda-
land driven by sea-level rise during the last deglaciation
Abstract: The rapid sea-level rise since the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM) ooded Sundaland changed Southeast
Asian coastal landscapes dramatically and impacted
the human demography. We reconstructed sea level
and paleogeography and infer the population history in
Southeast and South Asia since the LGM to present,
using 742 whole-genome sequencing datasets generated
by GenomeAsia 100K. We show that rapid sea-level rise
reduced land area by >50% since the LGM and segre-
gated human populations and drove Southeast Asians to
migrate into South Asia. Time: Wednesday, November

Dear all,
Welcome tothis one-daywebinar on December 3:
Anniversary Symposium
The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex -
150 years of feminist engagement with sexual selection
It is now 150 years since Charles Darwin published
the Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex,
elaborating his theory of sexual selection which aimed
at explaining the evolution of extravagant male sexual
characteristics of for example peacocks. Ever since its
publication, feminists have engaged in sexual selection
theory. First as external commentators to science argu-
ing for sexual selection as an emancipatory alternative
to god-given male supremacy in society, and later as
critics and agents of change within science. This in-
terdisciplinary symposium exhibits work by historians,
philosophers of science and biologists on feminist en-
gagements in sexual selection from 1871 till today.
The Webinar takes place on December 3, 2021. Each
talk takes 40 minutes followed by 10 minutes discussion.
The lectures will be recorded and made available after-
wards.
Participation is free of charge, register here:

Dear EvolDir,
Join us for the rst online and free conference on4 EvolDir December 1, 2021
\Transposable Elements in Human Brain Evolution and
Diseases" hosted by the University of Bologna (https:/-
/transposableelementsbrain.wordpress.com/)
Dec. 3rd, 2021 at 5pm CET
Mounting data suggest that Transposable Elements
(TEs) are a major evolutionary driving force. Indeed,
recent evidence suggests a role of TEs in human brain
evolution and diseases, i.e. neuropsychiatric disorders.
The aim of the conference is to highlight the role of
TEs in aecting brain functionality by bringing together
researches on human stem cells and on vertebrate model
brains. During the course of the conference our speakers
will illustrate the state of the art of TEs in brain evolu-
tion and diseases and describe new perspectives in this
eld. The invited speakers are leading researchers in
the sector: Jose Luis Garcia-Perez, Marie E. J >1
2nnson,
Cedric Feschotte and Fabio Macciardi.
The conference consists of four contributed talks (30 min-
utes) and a round table in breakout rooms and is open
for everyone that wishes to attend. Pre-registration
is required. A schedule for the symposium together
with information about registrations can be found
at, https://transposableelementsbrain.wordpress.com/

Dear all,
Registration for PopGroup55 is now open!
To register and get more information about
the meeting please follow this link:https://-
www.populationgeneticsgroup.org.uk/. Virtual
with twist
Although this year's PopGroup will once againbe virtual,
we have made some changes to try and increase network-
ing opportunities and support early career researchers.
We are encouraging attendees to set up local-meet
ups to watch talks, discuss science and socialise.
These meet-ups could be as simple as a few people
sharing a laptop in an oce, or be a larger gathering
bringing together popgroupers from neighbouring
cities to watch on a big screen. Or anything in
between.Whatever the size of the meet-up, we will be
supporting local-organisers and will provide vouchers
for catering through a food delivery supplier. Theidea is
to get together as safely as possible, talk about science
and get a bit of the of the PopGroup atmosphere.
More information about local-meet ups can be found
here:https://www.populationgeneticsgroup.org.uk/-
local-meet-up-information/ .If you are interested in
coordinating a local meet-up then please emailtrain-
ing@earlham.ac.uk.
Attendees are also more than welcome to attend and
participate in PopGroup55 as an individual and will be
able to join theZoom link from anywhere they wish to.
Talks and Twitter ash presentations Abstract sub-
mission for talks is open and as usual talks will be
allocated on a rst come rst served basis. Instead of
an online poster session, we are inviting attendees to

Dear All,
At the next CIGENE seminar, Anthony Mathelier, Uni-
versity of Oslo, will present: Towards high-quality maps
of TF-DNA interactions Abstract: Transcription Fac-
tors (TFs) are key proteins regulating when and where
genes are expressed through their interaction with the
DNA at specic binding sites. Hence, the identication
of these TF binding sites (TFBSs) is essential to further
our understanding of transcriptional regulation. In this
talk, I will present our recently developed methodol-
ogy to identify high-quality direct TF-DNA interactions
by combining experiment and computational evidence.

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
17TH ANNUAL EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS SYM-
POSIUM
Racial Justice in EEB Research
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
(EEB) at the University of Michigan invites nomina-
tions for the 17th Annual Early Career Scientists Sym-
posium. The symposium will highlight early career re-
searchers transforming our discipline through anti-racist
and justice-centered research that pushes our under-
standing of the links between EEB research and society.
The goal of this symposium is to provide a space for
the EEB community to think imaginatively about the
future of our discipline. With this in mind, we wel-
come nominations of researchers who take anti-racist
and justice-centered approaches to research in any area
of EEB, which could include (but not limited to): Global
Environmental Change, Genomics and Population Ge-
netics, Urban Ecology and Evolution, Environmental
History, Stem Education, Museum Science, Marine Ecol-6 EvolDir December 1, 2021
ogy, Water Security, Theoretical Ecology and Evolution,
Global Food Systems, and Disease Ecology.
The symposium will take place across four consecutive
Fridays from March 19th - April 8th, 2022. Eight early
career scientists will be selected to present their work,
and two keynote speakers will be featured. The sympo-
sium will kick o with an in-person and live-streamed
event on March 19th. The symposium will move to
a virtual format in the following weeks, with two to
three participants presenting each week, followed by a
moderated discussion.
For the symposium, we consider early career scientists
as senior graduate students (who stand to receive their
Ph.D. within two years), postdoctoral researchers, fac-
ulty or sta scientists within their rst or second year,
and researchers at equivalent career stages who are not
aliated with an academic institution. Please contact
the planning committee with questions about eligibility.
Nominations can come from colleagues or advisors. Self-
nominations are also encouraged. Nomination materials
should include: (1) contact information, (2) a brief
description of the nominee's work and proposed presen-
tation, and (3) any other information that may help the
committee review and select participants (for example,
the nominee's curriculum vitae; link to the nominee's
professional website; representative publication, media,
or product that showcases the nominee's work).
Nominations should be sent electronically as a single
PDF le to ecss-2022@umich.edu using the subject line
format, \nominee's Last Name, First Name ECSS 2022

common poster/break areas to enhance interaction.
Keystone Symposia remains committed to in-person
meetings in 2022, requiring all participants to be vac-
cinated. Canada is open to fully vaccinated visitors,
and its current vaccination rate is close to 75%. We
have not yet received permission for livestream and on-
demand options, however in any case the presenters are
expected to attend and present in-person, to ensure ex-
tensive interaction. Travel scholarships are available for
early-career and under-represented scientists. Abstract
is required to qualify for scholarships.
Please forward this information to your colleagues and
trainees who might be interested in attending, and

AmphibianDiseaseEvolution
We are seeking a PhD student to work at the inter-
face of amphibian disease ecology, microbiology, and
evolutionary ecology.
The lab of Dr. Amy Ellison is oering a PhD studentship
to study Chytrid infection dynamics in the poison frog,
Dendrobates tinctorius. This is an exciting opportunity
to work as part of an international team to explore
and develop interests and expertise in the dynamics of
amphibian disease.
Application deadline: 12 Jan 2022Project description: Infectious diseases have long been
known to be inuenced by the biotic, abiotic, and ge-
netic ^ a' under which they occur. Recently, the microbial
community that lives within and on an individual has
been shown to aect susceptibility to disease. However,
because microbiomes are dynamic and aected by both
the ecology and genetics of their host, a central goal in
disease ecology is to understand how the environment
interacts with an organism's ecology and evolutionary
history to aect both their microbiome and disease sus-
ceptibility.
In this project, based at Bangor University and in col-
laboration with the Smithsonian National Zoo and Con-
servation Biology Institute (USA), the student will use
a combination of laboratory animal experiments, eld-
work and molecular approaches to investigate the links
between ecology, evolution, and the microbiome of the
dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) on suscepti-
bility to the fungal skin pathogen Batrachochytrium den-
drobatidis (Bd), considered one of the greatest threats
to vertebrate biodiversity around the world.
The project oers a wealth of opportunities for the
student to gain experience in molecular biology, evo-
lutionary genetics, microbiology, disease ecology and
science communication. The studentship will be based
within the Molecular Ecology and Evolution group
(meeb.bangor.ac.uk), a world leader in the analyses of
molecular data addressing global issues in disease biol-
ogy and evolutionary genomics. It oers a dynamic and
supportive training environment for young scientists.
There will be opportunities for the student to work and
train with US collaborators and perform international
eldwork (South America) during the project.
Location: The studentship will be held at Bangor Uni-
versity, in Northwest Wales, with opportunities to visit
project partners in the USA and conduct eldwork at
locations in South America. The Molecular Ecology
and Evolution group at Bangor (MEEB) is an interna-
tionally leading research group that focuses on under-
standing the diversity and function of both micro- and
macro-organisms, including plants, microorganisms and
animals throughout terrestrial, aquatic and aerobiolog-
ical biomes. A central part of our work involves the
application of genetics, genomics, transcriptomics and
other high-throughput molecular techniques to address
fundamental evolutionary and ecological questions re-
lating to the origins, levels, distribution and ecological
signicance of genetic variation. In MEEB we comple-
ment molecular genetic data with detailed ecological,
behavioural, physiological, microbiological and environ-
mental data to understand the underlying causes of
individual, population or species diversity in time and
space.December 1, 2021 EvolDir 9

I am seeking applicants for a competitively funded
PhD program as part of my new research group
at Bangor University in Wales, UK. The success-
ful applicant will be put forward for funding from
the Envision Doctoral Training Program (NERC-
funded). More details: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/-
lec/research/envision/ *About the Project:* Environ-
mental change is causing temperatures to rise across the
globe - how this will aect the distribution and abun-
dance of species is therefore an important current focus
for ecologists worldwide. An under recognised aspect
of climate change is increased overwinter temperatures.
While research has focused largely on the impacts of
hot periods (i.e. summer) getting hotter, winter tem-
peratures have in fact been rising at a faster rate than
summer temperatures over the last century. Ectother-
mic species such as reptiles are especially vulnerable
to projected thermal shifts given their physiologicalreliance on ambient temperatures. However, reptile re-
sponses to climate shifts have received little attention,
and existing work has been heavily biased towards the
summer active season. Reptiles at temperate latitudes
often rely on a temperature-sensitive winter hibernation
period. Evidence suggests that milder winters could
disrupt hibernation, with lasting carryover eects on
phenology, breeding success, and tolerance to stressors.
Nevertheless, due to the scarcity of data, how reptiles
in temperate regions such as the United Kingdom will
respond to rising winter temperatures remains unknown.
The student will conduct laboratory-based experiments
using an invasive lizard in the UK, the wall lizard (Po-
darcis muralis), in conjunction with wild population
monitoring, and collation and analysis of long-term
data, to investigate: (1) how increased overwinter tem-
peratures aect wall lizard reproductive success, and
hormonal and behavioural responses to stress in captive
and wild populations, and (2) how historical patterns
of winter-warming have inuenced the distribution and
phenology of British reptiles to date. This project will
involve eld and lab-based work, as well as the assembly
of novel and exciting datasets from public records. The
Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust will serve
as a CASE partner and will provide further training
opportunities.
*Eligibility:* Applicants should hold a minimum of a
UK Honours Degree at 2:1 level or equivalent in sub-
jects such as Zoology, Animal Behaviour, Conservation
Science, or Biology. Past eld or laboratory research
experience is an advantage but will not be used as an
exclusion criteria for shortlisting. International appli-
cants welcome - top-up fees will be waived (i.e. funding
will cover all international fees).

Funding Status: Funding is in competition with other
projects and students (NERC DTP)
Project Description The colonisation of land by life is
one of the major evolutionary transitions in the his-
tory of the planet which dramatically shaped modern
terrestrial ecosystems. Despite its key ecological and
evolutionary importance, the genetic and cellular ba-
sis of terrestrialisation and its timing(s) are not well
understood. This project brings together a team of
expert zoologists, palaeontologists, genome biologists,
and developmental biologists. Our main objective is to
apply an integrative approach based on the \from genes
to ecosystems" framework to understand the genetic
and cellular basis, as well as the environmental factor
underpinning the adaptation of animal life on land. We
will use the latest genomic approaches and comparative
methods to disentangle the multiple transitions from
water to land in animals.
Project Aims and Methods Following the \from genes
to ecosystems" integrative philosophy and exploting
available data, we will identify the genome-wide gene
changes, their biological functions, and their mode of
evolution (gene gains, losses, horizontal genetic transfer,
etc) during terrestrialisation, and reconstruct a precise
timescale of the transitions to land to identify the speed
of these transitions as well as their ecoenvironmental
contexts.
We will apply an evolutionary genomics pipeline de-
veloped in the host lab, published in Current Biology,
Nature Communications, and Nature Ecology and Evo-
lution, to infer the node of origin of a gene family. The
biological function of genes of interest (e.g., gained dur-
ing terrestrialisation) will be interrogated via Gene On-
tology. For molecular dating, the gene family members
will be aligned with MAFFT, ambiguous regions will be
trimmed with BMGE, and trees will be inferred with
Phylobayes. Molecular dating of the trees, using fossils
and geological events to dene soft minimum and maxi-
mum constraints, will be done with MCMCTree within
PAML. Environmental conditions for the dierent dates
will be mined from the literature. The student will
contribute to the execution of these analyses and the
overall design of the project, bringing in their own ideas
and informing the research direction.
Candidate requirements The candidate should have a
deep interest in evolutionary biology, and an eager-
ness to learn computational methods and programming.
Knowledge of molecular biology, invertebrate diversity,
or palaeontology would be advantageous but is not re-
quired. We welcome and encourage student applicationsfrom under-represented groups. We value a diverse
research environment.
Project partners This project has an exciting partner
in the Natural History Museum London (NHML). The
NHML is a research institution with international repu-
tation that hosts over 350 scientists. Its researchers hold
unique expertise in evolutionary biology, biodiversity
and phylogenetics, supported by the Museum's core re-
search labs and vast biological collections. An acclaimed
research institution, the NHM publishes over 700 sci-
entic papers a year with international collaborators.
The collections hold 80 million objects that span 4.5
billion years, from the formation of the solar system to
the present day. The student will work closely with Dr
Greg Edgecombe FRS, who will provide opportunities
to access collections and collaborate and network with
other researchers in the NHM.
Training You will be working at the forefront of
an active area of research and will be trained in
phylogenetics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics,
and animal evolution. You will learn how to generate,
analyse, and interpret datasets using cutting edge
sequencing methods and computational techniques.
Finally, you will learn how to present challenging ideas
to the scientic community and the public through
the publication of articles in scientic journals and
presenting your work at international conferences.
All these are extremely valuable transferrable skills,
and you will be fully equipped for a career in both
academia and the private sector. Contact Name Jordi

CLIMATE: THE EVOLUTION OF CAPITAL AND
INCOME BREEDING STRATEGIES IN SEALS

January, 2022 or shortly thereafter
Species in Polar Regions are very sensitive and have
evolved specializations over time to successfully sur-
vive and reproduce in their unique habitats. Ongoing
global climate change is disproportionately aecting po-
lar species, and the question of whether they can cope
and adapt to such changes is urgently pressing. Seals are
often considered icons for how organisms evolve to adapt
to their environment, and they have developed dierent
strategies to successfully produce and raise ospring.
The females of some species, called capital breeders,
build up large fat reserves, allowing them to give birth
and nurse their pups for periods of up to several weeks
without feeding. These females may transfer as much
as 30% of their body mass to their pups, and seal milk
contains the highest levels of fat of any mammal species.
The females of other species, called income breeders,
don't build large fat reserves, and instead regularly leave
their pup to forage. Because income breeding is rela-
tively much more common, it has been hypothesized
that capital breeding may have evolved to deal with lim-
ited or unpredictable food availability. With the global
climate changing rapidly, and industrial shing impact-
ing marine food webs, food resources for seals around
the world are likely changing in both their predictability
and abundance. An understanding of the physiological
basis for reproductive strategies could provide important
insights for understanding the ability of seals to adapt
to environmental changes and for managing healthy seal
populations for the future.
This project will use genome-scale data to address the
following questions:
1) What is the evolutionary history of phocid seals and
what are the phylogenetic relationships between capital
and income breeding species? How has past climate
change inuenced their evolution? 2) Have strictly capi-
tal breeding species evolved specially adapted cellular
pathways to convert energy to fat, store it, and then
mobilize it to produce milk with extremely high fat
content? 3) Does dierential gene expression play a role
in facilitating the use of mixed strategies?

While progress has been made in understanding the ecol-

gaps to ll. For example, the natural predators of adult
mosquitoes are relatively poorly known, as is the role
of these predators in controlling mosquito populations.
Bats especially are known to be voracious predators,
and may be able to consume 600 mosquitoes per hour,
however it remains unclear which species they may be
consuming (disease vectors or those that are relatively
benign). Our DNA sequence data from bird and bat

preferences-of-bumblebees-across-a-range-of-european-
climates/?p137456 Floral preferences of bumblebees
across a range of European climates
Deadline: 7th January 2022
To apply:https://www.iapetus2.ac.uk/how-to-apply/
Background. Bumblebees are agriculturally important
pollinators, but are currently declining in abundance in
the UK and around the world, in part due to climate
change (Soroye et al. 2020). Understanding these de-
clines requires research on the biology and ecology of
these species. Bumblebees are thought to be general-
ists, pollinating a variety of ower species. However,
our preliminary observations conducted in Durham in
summers 2020 and 2021 indicate that dierent bum-
blebee species prefer dierent plants (see also Sikora
et al. 2020). Bumblebees have been a preferred in-
sect model for neuroethology and sensory neuroscience,
and a wealth of earlier work has focussed on the im-
portance of visual cues and nectar/pollen reward for
foraging honeybees and bumblebees (Latty and True-
blood 2020). In contrast, the importance of oral smells
is less well known, although some works report the essen-
tial role of ower volatiles in bumblebees??? oral choice
(Galen and Kevan 1983; Suchet et al. 2011; Haber et
al. 2019). This project will investigate olfactory prefer-
ences of commonly occurring bumblebees (e.g. Bombusterrestris, Bombus pascuorum and Bombus lapidarius)
to naturally-occurring oral volatiles, and how these
preferences are aected by climatic conditions and back-
ground plant communities in Norway (Kl??fta), UK
(Durham and Stirling), Germany (W??rzburg), Italy
(Milan) and Portugal (Braganca). We expect the plants
that the bumblebees forage on to dier between these
location, due to dierent climatic condition. We hypoth-
esise that, despite the dierences in plant species, the
key components of oral bouquets will be very similar
across test locations.
Aims. 1) To identify plants that bumblebees forage
on in the ve countries, to establish plant preferences
for bumblebee species; 2) Collect oral volatiles from
the plants identied in Aim 1, as well as orals that
bumblebees do not forage on, as controls; analyse these
volatiles by GC/MS ; 3) Establish behavioural prefer-
ences of bumblebees in response to full oral bouquets
and components of bouquets, fractions and synthetic
components of that are specic for focal plant species.
Methodology: Bee and plant collections will be con-
ducted in the areas around Durham, Stirling, Kl??fta,
W??rzburg, Milan and Braganca in March-September
during the local bumblebee foraging periods. The stu-
dent will be advised and assisted during eld collection
by OR and local members of the supervisory team. Stu-
dent will be trained to identify plants and bumblebees
via morphological cues and DNA barcoding. Floral
volatiles will be collected at the same time as bum-
blebees by using standard volatiles traps, and will be
analysed by the student via gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry in TS laboratory. Behavioural olfactory
assays on bees will be conducted in the eld or either in
the glasshouse at the Biocentre, University of W??rzburg
or in a glasshouse at Durham Botanical garden. The
bees will be given a choice between 2 stimuli, or stimu-
lus and a control, and their preference for a smell will
be inferred from the tendency of a bee to land at the
stimulus.
Training and skills: The student will receive training: 1)
by supervisors with complementary skills and expertise;
2) by collaborators and postdocs in the seven partic-
ipating institutions; 3) by attending summer courses,
conferences and Durham-run training events; 4) by par-
ticipating in regular public outreach activities; 5) by
helping OR to supervise UG students; 6) by present-
ing their work at lab meetings and conferences. The
student will acquire knowledge and skills in: 1) insect
chemical ecology and neuroethology; 2) gas chromatog-
raphy/mass spectrometry and collection of volatiles; 3)
bumblebee rearing; 4) identication of bumblebees and

A 4-year PhD fellowship is now available in associa-
tion with the funded project \Selection on a tropical
elevational gradient" (PID2020-120115GB-I00). In this
project we use genomics in combination with other tools
such as eld ecology, morphology, and population ge-
netics to study the origin and**maintenance of biodi-
versity in tropical forests. What limits species' distribu-
tions? Which factors determine population structure in
widespread, lowland tropical species? Is selection more
ecient in high or low elevation populations? The study
system involves small mammals in tropical east Asia,
especially Borneo. The project is collaborative and in-
cludes students and researchers in Spain and Malaysia.
The project involves eldwork on the Sunda Shelf (most
likely Borneo). The student is expected, with the sup-
port of the collaboration and the group, to produce
science at an international standard to be published in
international scientic journals. The student is expected
to actively participate as a member of the group. The
student must be eligible to enroll in a Spanish PhD
program (and thus must poses a Masters degree). Cer-
tication in ethical handling of animals and experience
in genetic/genomic analyses will be favorably consid-
ered. >1

PollinatorEvolution
PhD Advert: Arctic plant-pollinator trait responses to
climate change Supervisor: Dr Richard Gill (Imperial
College London, UK)
Our understanding of how plant-pollinator relationships
are being aected by climate change remains in its16 EvolDir December 1, 2021
infancy. Filling this evidence gap requires us to un-
derstand the eco-evolutionary processes by which pop-
ulations of plants and their insect pollinators are dy-
namically responding, and how this translates to plant-
pollinator network evolution under climate change. To
do this, we must integrate plant and pollinator trait
response data with detailed observations of interactions.
Bringing such data together will enable us to investigate
how trait plasticity to environmental variation (and
subsequent changes to functional trait distributions)
mediates co-evolved relationships, and determines both
interaction turnover and co-extinction risks.
This project will involve eldwork studying an Arctic
plant-pollinator community located in Lapland (Sweden)
along an elevational gradient. The student will study
plant-pollinator interactions across an environmental
gradient. Using a space-for-time substitution approach,
the student will investigate responses across a [localised]
climatic range. Through a complement of eld and
lab work, the student will collect data on how plant
and pollinator [bumblebee] traits vary within and be-
tween species, primarily analysing how dierent aspects
of temperature determine this. This interdisciplinary
project will be co-supervised by Prof. Phil Stevenson
(Kew Gardens, UK) & Dr Keith Larson (Umea Univer-
sity, Sweden), and will further benet from collabora-
tors: Dr Jacob Johansson (Lund University, Sweden);
Jason Tylianakis (Canterbury University, NZ) and An-
drew MacDougal (University of Guelph, Canada). The
student will be based at the Silwood Park campus of
Imperial College and hosted by the Gill lab.

AlpineOrchidEvolution
As part of the NERC-funded ARIES doctoral training
programme, we seek a PhD student for the project \Hy-
bridization and climate change in Alpine orchids". This
is a fully funded, 3.5-year PhD project open to both
UK and international students who are holders of a uni-
versity degree (a Masters degree is not required). The
primary supervisor is Dr. Kelsey Byers (John Innes Cen-
tre), with secondary supervisors Dr. C van Oosterhout
(University of East Anglia) and Enrico Coen (John Innes
Centre). The project is hosted at the John Innes Centre
in the Byers Lab and also includes extensive eldwork
in Switzerland and Italy. You can learn more about the
lab here: https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/kelsey-byers/
Hybrid populations of orchids in the European Alps
produce a \natural laboratory" that enables us to study
adaptive evolution in response to rapid environmental
change. Alpine ecosystems are under severe threat of
global warming and environmental change. Meadows
on dierent mountains provide an outstanding study
system to examine response to environmental change in
a naturally replicated design. This allows us to examine
parallel evolution in response to environmental change
across hybrids and their ancestor species.
The goal of this project is to understand how species
persist in fragile habitats despite the challenges of hy-
bridization and climate change. The aims are: (1) deter-
mine ancestry of hybrid orchids; (2) understand barriers
preventing species collapse between parent species from
(1); and (3) understand how these species may be re-
sponding to past and future climate change.
This project combines various techniques, including eld
surveys of orchid populations, sequencing and analysis,
and use of historical records of orchid occurrence and
climate. The student will spend part of each summer in
the European Alps surveying populations for owering
time and climate factors and collecting tissue for DNA
analysis of hybrids and their parent species. Fieldwork
will also include collection of pollinators and fruits to
determine isolating barriers between parent species be-
sides owering time. By combining historical climate
and occurrence/owering time data, the student will
determine the historical eects of climate change on
populations and their potential for hybridization. Using
spatial modeling/GIS, the student will also predict theeects of future climate change.
The student will have the opportunity for eldwork in
the Alps as well as training in methods in both the eld
and lab settings. This includes methods in genetics,
entomology, botany, and bioinformatics. Professional
training in scientic writing and presentation, as well as
development of knowledge in the eld through reading,
are also an integral part of this project.
The ideal student for this project would have a back-
ground in evolution, ecology, and/or genetics. Experi-
ence working with plants and/or insects is a plus. We
seek an enthusiastic, collaborative individual who is
excited by interdisciplinary research!
We particularly encourage applications from individuals
often underrepresented in STEM, including racial and
ethnic minorities, Indigenous, and BAME individuals;
LGBTQIA+ individuals; individuals with disabilities,
Deaf individuals, and those with chronic illness(es); and
women and gender minorities. Dr. Byers is commit-
ted to maintaining a respectful, inclusive, and friendly
working environment for all sta and students, as well
as promoting your personal and career development.

LMU Munich BehaviouralSpeciation
We are looking for a PhD student to investigate the
genes underlying behavioral isolation and speciation in
a recent radiation of *Chorthippus* grasshoppers. The
student will join Dr. Ricardo Pereira's research group
at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at (LMU) Munich, and
will work closely with Dr. Holger Schielzeth at Friedrich
Schiller University (FSU) Jena; both in Germany.18 EvolDir December 1, 2021
The 'omics' era reveals an increasing number of species
that are practically indistinguishable in morphology,
ecology or even in genetics, despite being reproductively
isolated from one another in sympatry. Such species
complexes present valuable study systems for evolu-
tionary biologists because the behavioral traits that
maintain species boundaries can directly be observed.
We will use sympatric grasshopper species of the genus
*Chorthippus* that have radiated under pervasive gene
ow ( https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15695) to: 1) test if
historical periods of allopatry facilitated the evolution
of behavioural isolation; 2) test if a genetic association
between male cues and female preference facilitates be-
havioral isolation in the face of gene ow; 3) test if
gene ow has played a role in generating a new hybrid
species.
This research program will train a PhD student in pop-
ulation genomics, QTL analyses, and behavioral essays.
Therefore, any training in related elds (experimental
hybridization, behavioral experiments, next generation
sequencing, and bioinformatics) is highly desirable. The
successful student will have (or soon have) completed
their Master's degree in a relevant discipline.
The student will be integrated within the Division
of Evolutionary Biology (http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de),
and will be part of vibrant international communities
of scientists working on related elds, such as specia-
tion genomics, behavioral isolation, and comparative
genomics. The working language of the lab and the Di-
vision of Evolutionary Biology is English. The position
is funded by a DFG grant (Porous species: using gene
ow to uncover the genes maintaining behavioral isola-
tion) awarded to Drs. Pereira and Schielzeth. Salary
is paid according to the German salary scheme for the
public sector for doctoral research (65% E13 TV-L)
and is guaranteed for at least 3 years. The success-
ful applicant would start around March 2022 in order
to match the required eld work. Further information
and questions should be directed to Ricardo Pereira

NTNU Norway
EvolutionSocialBehaviour
PhD position on The Evolutionary Ecology of Social
Behaviour, Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD),
NTNU, Trondheim, Norway
General aim of the project: Predicting responses to a
changing environment is currently one of the biggest
challenges in biology. The realization that evolutionary
change can rapidly aect ecological and demographic
processes, and thus determine the ability of populations
to cope with environmental change, has led to a rapid
increase in the number of studies focusing on the feed-
backs between ecology and evolution (eco-evolutionary
dynamics). Surprisingly, even though competition, co-
operation and sexual reproduction are key ecological
processes determining phenotypic evolution and the size
of populations, classic theory on the evolution of so-
cial behaviour has not been fully integrated within the
eco-evolutionary dynamics paradigm. There is thus
a huge gap in our understanding of eco-evolutionary
dynamics, which hinders our ability to predict how pop-
ulations will respond to the rapid environmental change
currently faced by many organisms. This project will
help build this missing bridge between social behaviour
and eco-evolutionary dynamics research using a uni-
ed framework based on behavioural ecology theory on
social traits, quantitative genetic models providing sta-
tistical descriptions of the responses to selection, and
population projection models focusing on stochastic pop-
ulation dynamics. We will focus on a house sparrow
meta-population on Norwegian islands that has been
monitored since the early 90s. The project will involve
analyses of existing data and eldwork.
Accordingly, the main aims of the PhD position are 1) to
quantify how social interactions aect the reproductive
success of individuals; 2) to quantify the spatial and
social structure of house sparrows in dierent island pop-
ulations; and 3) to quantify how the patterns of social
interactions aect population dynamics and how popu-
lation dynamics aect the patterns of social interactions.
These aims will be achieved using an exceptional multi-
year dataset from a house sparrow meta-population in
Norway.
The position will suit a PhD candidate who is keen
to learn advanced statistical methods, and apply themto understand patterns, causes and consequences of
phenotypic variation arising in wild populations. It
will provide complete doctoral education to obtain a
doctoral degree, including primary research training,
PhD-level credit courses, and appropriate teaching expe-
rience. Research training will include data management,
statistical analyses including mixed models and capture-
mark-recapture approaches, experience of eld data col-
lection, and experience of working within a collaborative
research team.
Requirements: The successful candidate should have a
quantitative methods background in evolutionary biol-
ogy and behavioural ecology. The working environment

PennState
InsectPlantTranscriptomics
Seeking PhD student in insect ecology and/or plant
transcriptomics
The Tooker and Renner labs in the Department of En-
tomology at Penn State seek a PhD student to start in
Fall 2022. We seek a highly motivated student with a
record of success to conduct collaborative research on an
NSF-funded project that will explore how plants make
decisions. Previous research in the Tooker lab has de-
termined that goldenrod plants (Solidago altissima) can
detect both herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV)
and the putative sex pheromone of a gall-inducing y
that attacks S. altissima. The new project will determine
how goldenrod plants prioritize their defensive responses
after exposure to these cues and then damage from the
associated herbivore species (the gall-inducing y or a
leaf beetle). The Tooker lab will conduct greenhouse-
and eld-based ecological studies that will be comple-
mented by transcriptomic analyses of plant responses
completed with the Renner lab. Students are strongly
encourage to apply if they have interests in ecological
work and have had some training in molecular skills
generally, and ideally some transcriptomics experience.
Alternatively, we would be happy to have students apply
that are skilled with molecular techniques and would like
to get involved in some ecological work. High-achieving
international students are also encouraged to apply.
Application: Send a letter of interest and curriculum
vitae to Tanya Renner (tur158@psu.edu), Department
of Entomology, The Pennsylvania State University, Uni-
versity Park, PA. Students who apply to our department
by 15 December 2021 and are highly ranked may be
invited to our department's invitation-only Graduate
Student Recruitment event, which will be held virtually
in Jan 2022. Students that enroll will require successful
completion of background check(s) in accordance with
University policies. Penn State is committed to arma-
tive action, equal opportunity and the diversity of its
workforce.

MSc project on bird's bioacoustics in Prague: Geo-
graphic song variation of male Tawny Pipits (Anthus
campestris) in European populations
Dear interested MS students,
Based at Charles University (Prague, Czech Republic),
we are seeking for highly motivated applicants to join our
research group for a master's thesis on the geographic
song variation of a migratory passerine bird.
The focus of the project will be to explore the intraspe-
cic geographic song variation of the Tawny Pipit (An-
thus campestris) in Europe. The selected candidate will
assess the song dierentiation among male individuals
from four dierent populations in the Czech Republic,
Italy, and Spain that dier in population density (high
VS low) and population isolation (isolated VS continu-
ous). However, we might also consider the possibility
of using recordings available in public repositories (e.g.,
Xeno-Canto) to include individuals from some more
distant locations.
This project is data-based, although the prospective stu-
dent might have the chance to spend some time recording
Tawny Pipits in our eld site in the Czech Republic (an
active surface coal mine area, the only Czech locality
with isolated population of Tawny Pipits). Additionally,
it can be discussed further the option of getting some
more eldwork experience by giving a hand in other
projects of this group conducted in dierent eld sites
around the Czech Republic. Experience using bioacous-
tics software is welcome but not essential; if needed, the
student can be trained in the use of specialized software
for bioacoustics studies such as the widely used Avisoft
and Raven and the up-and-coming Luscinia
**IMPORTANT: This project is only oered to master
students (not BSc thesis nor candidates looking for a
PhD project)

Graduate Positions in Ecology and Evolution of Infec-
tious Diseases, Guaranteed TA/RAship for ve years.
The He Lab at Purdue University investigates infectious
disease dynamics by considering antigenic diversication
and epidemiology. Specically, we study how balanc-
ing selection drives eco-evolutionary dynamics of disease
agents, using malaria antigens as a model system. We de-
velop new epidemiological quantities to predict whether
new disease variants would invade local transmissions,
which would help establish new guidelines for interven-
tion in malaria as well as other infectious diseases. We
employ data science and mathematical approaches to the
theory, and verify it via epidemiological and genomic se-
quencing data. Thanks to the collaborative nature of our
work, we have established national and international re-
search partners (University of Chicago, Louisiana State
University, University of Melbourne, and Shaanxi Nor-
mal University). More info: www.qixinhe.net We are
looking for highly motivated students who have acquired
a strong quantitative background or prepare to obtain
rigorous quantitative and computational skills training.
Prior knowledge in molecular biology and genetics is
preferred. Students are also encouraged to develop their
own projects for the thesis, including similar questions
on other disease agents. Students can expect to work
in a lab that is collaborative, diverse, and welcoming.

UCalifornia Davis EvolutionaryBiol
I am recruiting 1-2 new Ph.D. students into my research
group at the University of California Davis for next
academic year (Fall 2022).
If you are interested in studying how species adapt to
human-altered environments, then read on ^A We have a
new grant funded by the NIEHS to explore the genetic
changes that have enabled very rapid adaptive evolution
to extreme environmental change. More specically, we
seek to further our understanding of the genetic basis of
evolved pollution resistance in Atlantic killish. Killish
are marine sh that are abundant in coastal estuaries.
Over the span of just a few decades, populations in
urban estuaries have evolved resistance to extreme pol-
lution, and this resistance has evolved multiple times
independently. This provides a naturally replicated
model system for studying mechanisms that underlie
rapid adaptation to human-altered environments.
You can nd some of our most recent
manuscripts on the subject here: https://-
whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/publications/
E.g., Reid et al 2016, Whitehead et al 2017, Oziolor et
al 2019
The core of the next phase of our research is to apply
quantitative genetics to uncover the genetic underpin-
nings of variation in sensitivity of pollution-induced
developmental deformities (e.g., embryonic cardiac de-
formities, etc). This work would be best suited for stu-
dents interested in Genetics, Evolution, Ecotoxicology,
and Ecophysiology. There is much room for recruited
students to bring their own creativity to bear on re-
lated research topics. And there is much opportunity
to collaborate with colleagues at other universities (e.g.,
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts)
and government agencies (e.g., US EPA in Rhode Is-December 1, 2021 EvolDir 27

context of the Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics.
At the center, diverse scholars from around the world
are revisiting the story of humans and animals more
generally from the \hologenomic perspective," in which
animals and their microbes{be they bacteria, fungi (such
as yeasts) or other taxa{are considered holistically.
Project description In general, the student will con-
sider the evolutionary relationship between humans and
the microbes associated with fermented foods. They
will do so while working in the rapidly growing eld of
human microbiome research at the interfaces of evolu-
tionary biology, genomics, microbiology, biogeography
and history/prehistory. As an example, a project might
be developed as follows ^A Humans are known to have
relied on yeasts, specically strains of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, to make beer and bread for many thousands
of years. Today, these yeasts are found in homes, on
human bodies and in fermented foods around the world.
Historically, it was thought that such yeasts were every-
where and simply colonized fermented foods from theair or the environment more generally. More recently,
it has become clear that these yeasts have traveled the
world with and even on humans. One version of this
PhD project would tell the study the story of these
yeasts, but rather than doing so from the human per-
spective (assuming humans control the yeasts and the
big story), from the yeasts' perspective. After all, the
global populations of yeasts are far larger than global
human populations (they have beneted more from us
than the reverse) and the products produced by yeasts
aect many aspects of human behavior (via their prod-
ucts, such as beer, wine and bread). In this framing, the
story of yeasts is not so unlike, for example, the story
of the Ophiocordyceps fungi that produce compounds
that alter the behavior of ants in ways that benet the
fungi (but not the ants). In this PhD, we propose to
take the perspective of yeasts, and other-fermentation
associated microbes, more seriously.
If focused on yeasts, this project could include at least
three elements. First, the student would work with
our team to develop models (drawing from approaches
used in community ecology and evolutionary theory) of
early interactions between humans and yeasts and those
situations in which yeasts might be expected to benet
more than humans and vise versa. These models could
be fully quantitative or more conceptual (e.g., on the
model of Madden et al), and would undoubtedly draw
on insights from insect-yeast relationships where models
tend to be better developed. Second, the student would
use phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches to con-
sider how and when yeasts spread around the world, and
the extent to which they spread with humans (based on
existing samples, but potentially also new samples and
hence eld work). Third, the student would consider
the scenarios in which humans and particular microbes
relied upon in food fermentation (together as a kind
of \extended hologenome") were more likely to succeed
relative to humans not engaging in interactions with
those same microbes.
During this project, the student has the potential to
solve ancient mysteries while simultaneously learning to
employ cutting edge approaches in, for example, phy-
logenomics/phylogenetics, microbial culturing, metage-
nomics, and biogeography.

1) How does a species' mating system and population-
size history aect the tness of an introduced plant
species? Supervisors: Matthew Harteld, Alex Twyford,
Mario Vallejo-Marin (University of Stirling).
Species that uniparentially reproduce to some degree
(either through self-fertilisation or clonal reproduction)
are more likely to establish themselves in remote ar-
eas, including islands. However, the reproductive mode
also aects how prevalent deleterious mutations are in
a species' genome; it can either reduce them so popula-
tions are more likely to persist, or enhance them due to
relaxed selection, leading to lowered tness. Introduced
populations are also likely to go through a population
bottleneck, which can further alter the prevalence of
deleterious mutations. It is unclear how the mating
system and population history interact to inuence the
long-term tness of new populations, especially with
regards to their deleterious mutation prevalence. The
goal of this project will be to analyse genome data
from Mimulus guttatus to quantify both the extent
of self-fertilisation and clonal reproduction in natural
populations in the UK, and the deleterious mutation
load.

2) New methods for detecting and quantifying genetic
adaptation Supervisors: Matthew Harteld, Konrad
Lohse.
Understanding how populations adapt to their environ-ment is a major focus of evolution research. There has
been great interest in identifying how benecial muta-
tions go to xation in populations; are they instantly
favourable after arising as a new mutation, or are other
mechanisms at play, including recurrent mutation or
selection on existing genetic variation? Despite many
advances in this eld, it has still proved tricky to de-
termine the evolutionary origins of benecial mutations.
This is especially true if we wish to infer the nature of
adaptation in wild populations, especially plants, that
uniparentally reproduce to some degree (that is, via
self-fertilisation and/or clonal reproduction) to test evo-
lutionary theories regarding how species with dierent
reproductive modes adapt to their environment. The
goals of this exciting project is to develop novel meth-
ods for detecting the prevalence of dierent types of
favourable mutations along a genome, and then apply
them to genome data to determine the how adaptation
proceeds in species with dierent reproductive modes.

Biology, University of Edinburgh, UK
Time travel to understand AMR: Metagenomics of an-
timicrobial resistance in wildlife through time and space
Supervisors: Katerina Guschanski, Luke McNally, Mick
Watson
Funding Status: Funding is in competition with otherDecember 1, 2021 EvolDir 29
projects and students through Doctoral Training Pro-
grams (NERC and BBSRC DTP)
Project Description Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is
a major threat for human health worldwide and poses a
signicant nancial burden in treatment costs. AMR is
also a crucial issue in agriculture and livestock health.
In addition, because antimicrobial resistance is a normal
function of natural environments, wild animals carry
resistance bacteria. Mounting evidence exists for the
exchange of resistant bacteria and their genes between
wildlife, livestock, and humans. Yet, due to a number
of key limitations, we know very little about the role of
wild animals in the global dynamic of maintenance and
spread of AMR.
First, because resistance bacteria and their genes are
easily spread even to the most remote regions, we lack
a baseline for AMR that is unaected by human-made
antibiotics. Second, we do not know how AMR load
changed following the advent of industrial-scale antibi-
otic production, which started in the 1940s. We also
lack comparative data to evaluate how local policies may
aect AMR load in wildlife. Finally, we do not have a
good understanding which wild animal species are more
likely to carry a high AMR load. Taken together, we
are missing crucial information for understanding global
AMR dynamics and for devising ecient measure to
reduce AMR spread among humans, environment and
wildlife.
This project will use ancient metagenomics of preserved
host-associated microbiomes to quantify AMR load and
characterize the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes
(ARGs) in wild animals from 100 years ago and until
today. By identifying key ecological characteristics of
wild animals that increase their exposure to antibiotics,
it will propose sentinel species for ecient monitoring
of environmental contamination. Spatial and temporal
comparisons will highlight governmental policies that
are successful in minimising AMR spill-over into the
environment. Going back in time, the project will al-
low the quantication of the impact of recent develop-
ments, both positive (e.g. restrictive use of antibiotics
in medicine) and negative (e.g. spillage of untreated
sewage) on the AMR load.
Methodology This project uses a unique, recently de-
veloped ancient metagenomics approach to study AMR
from dental calculus. Dental calculus is a calcied
host-associated oral microbiome that preserves on mam-
malian teeth, remains virtually unchanged through time,
and can be collected from museum specimens. It thus
represents a microbial fossil that provides a (genomic)
view into the past. With this tool, the project will
study in a comparative manner AMR across dierenthost species from various parts of the world and through
time, going back to before the advent of industrial-scale
antibiotic production.
The project will involve sample collection in natural
history museums, followed by sample processing in ded-
icated ancient DNA laboratories and metagenomic anal-
yses to quantify and characterise ARGs. The student
will have ample freedom to develop own research foci
within the global framework of the project.
Candidate requirements To be eligible for a PhD-student
position the applicant should have at least an upper
2.1 degree in evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, or a
related eld. The technical skills of the candidates will
be evaluated based on the experience with large-scale
sequence analyses and bioinformatics prociency. The
ideal candidate will have a strong interest and docu-
mented knowledge in evolutionary biology, with a drive
to understand processes shaping complex communities.
Perseverance and high intrinsic motivation are required
to work with non-standard samples and data. You will
be highly reliable, driven and well-organised, curious
and willing to think outside the box, with the ability
to quickly acquire new skills. Previous experience in
metagenomics and ancient DNA will be highly advanta-
geous.
The position will begin Fall 2022. Interested stu-
dents should send a current CV and a brief let-

Project 1: Sexual conict in a y with unusual sex
determination In organisms with separate sexes, sex
determination is among the most important early devel-
opmental processes for tness. Despite its importance,
in many groups of organisms sex determination is re-
markably dynamic, with the specic gene, chromosomal
location, and parent of origin of the sex determining
gene showing rapid turnover. This dynamism has been
proposed to reect conict between genes and between
parents.
A clear case of conict occurs in a group of small ies, the
fungus gnats, which exhibit so-called paternal genome
elimination, in which males eliminate the genome they
inherit from their fathers. This system puts extremely
strong selection on fathers to produce daughters, since
sons do not transmit their genes. Theory predicts adap-
tation in both sex determination mechanism and mating
behaviour. Consistent with this, we see frequent tran-
sitions in sex determination mechanism, with dierent
chromosomes determining sex in dierent species. Some
species even exhibiting maternal sex determination, in
which some mothers have only sons, others only daugh-
ters. We also expect behavioural adaptation, since males
are expected to evolve to prefer to mate with mothers
more likely to bear daughters, particularly in the case
of maternal sex determination.
The project involves, bioinformatic, behavioural and
theoretical studies of this group to understand the
causes and consequences of maternal sex determina-
tion and paternal genome elimination. At the bioin-
formatic level, bioinformatic analyses of genomes and
transcriptomes of related species will illucidate the
population-genetic processes driving sex determination
evolution. At the behavioral level, studies of mating
behavior will probe adaptations to maternal sex deter-
mination. At the theoretical level, there are opportu-
nities to develop new models to generate predictions
to regarding the origins and consequences of mater-
nal sex determination and paternal genome elimination.
This project will be co-supervised by Scott Roy (San
Francisco State University and there will be opportu-nities for the candidate to visit his lab. More infor-

Developing an insect model for studying epigenetics and
aging Medical advances have extended lifespan, yet this
has not been matched with prolonged health. A key
challenge is to nd ways to improve health and well-
being in older age. It is therefore vital we understand
the molecular aging process in order to determine how
aging leads to increased disease and ill health. Epige-
netic clocks, and specically DNA methylation clocks,
have recently been identied as important predictors of
biological age and associated morbidity from molecular
data. However, there is currently no tractable insect
model system to explore and manipulate DNA methyla-
tion for aging based research. This PhD project would
begin to establish such as system. Mealybugs (small
plant parasites) provide an ideal system to study epige-
nomic ageing processes. Females live almost double that
of males and our lab has recently shown extreme sex-
specic DNA methylation proles. We have also shown
mealybugs, unlike almost all studied insect species, pos-
sess promotor DNA methylation which is correlated
with lower gene expression. This unique feature means
mealybugs provide the closest insect DNA methylation
prole to that found in mammals. In addition to pro-
viding an excellent system to study epigenomic ageing
processes mealybugs are also invasive agricultural pests
meaning results from this research can be applied across
strategic interests. The project is co-supervised by Dr.
Jenny Regan (Edinburgh). A comprehensive training
programme will be provided comprising both specialist
scientic training and generic transferable and profes-
sional skills. Specically, the student will undertake
training in DNA damage accumulation assays, tness /
life history assays, advanced microscopy, DNA / RNA

award/?idB36 * Project background *
In a world that is changing at an unprecedented rate,
understanding how environmental change shapes the
dynamics of populations is key. Analyses of long-term
data on birds and (non-human) mammals have shown
that evolution can act on relatively short timescales,
and that understanding the origin and maintenance of
biological diversity ultimately requires an evolutionary
(genetic) approach. This contrasts starkly with the state
of research regarding our own species, where the role
of genetic variation, selection and evolution in shaping
individual life-histories is poorly understood, and often
dismissed a priori.
This project applies analytical tools from evolutionary
biology, statistics, and quantitative genetics to a unique
genealogical dataset from central Europe, spanning four
centuries and detailing the lives of tens of thousands
of people. Analyses of individual-based pedigree, life-
history and tness data allows you to:
i) Quantify the relative importance of genes, environ-
ment, and culture in shaping life-histories. ii) Measure
the strength and shape of selection on key life-history
traits during modern history. iii) Infer how human
life-histories have evolved over the course of modern
history, and how these evolutionary trajectories have
been shaped by societal change.

MS on Pollination in Urban Orchards The Muchhala
Lab invites applicants for a Master of Science position in
the Department of Biology at the University of Missouri
- St. Louis. The successful applicant will be funded as a
Research Associate, including stipend and tuition, and
will contribute to a USDA-funded project focused on
pollination services in urban orchards in the St. Louis
region (see summary below). Applicants should have
an undergraduate degree in Biology (or an appropri-
ate subeld) and prior research experience, preferably
involving eldwork, insect identication, and/or pollina-
tion methodology. The project will involve working with
other graduate students and PIs from multiple institu-
tions, and leading a team of undergraduate students,
on experimental and observational research aimed at
quantifying pollination services and fruit yield across
multiple urban orchards.
Review of applicants will begin on November 30th, with
the position preferably beginning in Spring Semester
(January) of 2022. Applications should include a cur-
riculum vitae and a short statement (one to two pages)
on previous experience, research interest, and moti-
vation for applying. Combine materials into a single
PDF or Microsoft Word document and send to much-

recommendation letters sent to the same email.
Project Summary Around the world, it is becoming
increasingly popular to plant orchards within cities
and towns. Fruiting trees can provide an important
local source of high-quality food, particularly in low-
income regions, and reduce the environmental impacts
of long-distance transport of food. However, maintain-
ing orchards in heavily populated areas poses several
challenges. In particular, there needs to be sucient
insect pollinators to ensure fruiting success. We propose
to evaluate pollination in tens of orchards across the
city of St. Louis, examining how factors such as human
population density, socioeconomic status, soil type, and
surrounding vegetation impact insect numbers and fruit
yield. We will then focus on nine of these orchards to
perform detailed experiments to test the eects of in-
creasing pollinator numbers directly, by adding colonies
of native bees, or indirectly, by adding blackberry stems
and commercial bee houses that they can use as nesting34 EvolDir December 1, 2021
sites. This work represents a collaboration between four
local universities, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the
Saint Louis Zoo, and a non-prot organization (Gateway
Greening) established to increase urban agriculture in
St. Louis; we will involve many students in the research,

UMuenster SticklebackTapeworm
The Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity at the Uni-
versity of M >1
2nster, Germany, is seeking to ll the
position of a
Doctoral Student (Ph.D position)
(salary level TV-L E 13)
for the externally funded project SFB/TRR 212 at the
earliest possible date. We are oering a xed-term posi-
tion (65%) for 3 years.
Your tasks:
The position is part of the Collaborative Research Cen-
tre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled: A Novel Synthesis of Indi-
vidualisation across Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution:
Niche Choice, Niche Conformance, Niche Construction
(NC3), as granted by the German Research Foundation
(DFG).
This PhD project deals with the ecological and evolu-
tionary eects of parasite virulence. In this project,
you will investigate the niche construction eects of
a trophically transmitted tapeworm parasite (Schisto-
cephalus solidus) on individual three-spined stickleback
sh. The project aims to show how these eects cascade
from the individual to the ecosystem level and alter
eco-evolutionary dynamics. The successful candidate
will be involved in mesocosm experiments to investi-
gate how parasite virulence aects individual trophic
specialisation of the hosts. We also aim to identify
the physiological and metabolic traits associated withthese individual dierences. The successful candidate
will further take advantage of transcriptomic datasets
to identify the immuno-physiological traits associated
with host niche individualisation, and contribute to the
development of computational models that will bridge
the gap between individual, population, and community
processes.
Our expectations:
Applicants should be highly motivated scientists of any
nationality, who are interested in interdisciplinary work.
They should have the equivalent of a master degree in
biology, preferentially with a focus on evolution and
ecology, or related elds. A background, and ideally
some experience, in any of the following areas will be
useful: sh handling and care, limnology, molecular
skills, individual-based models, as well as a good under-
standing of statistics. Applicants should have excellent
communication skills and be able to work both inde-
pendently and as part of a multidisciplinary team. The
working language of the Institute and the lab is English,
and good prociency in spoken and written English is a
requirement.

UPotsdam AdaptationBruceEect
PhD position at the animal ecology group in Potsdam,
Germany.
Topic: Pregnancy replacement in mammals - all costs
or hidden benets for females?
The adaptive value of many behavioural processes may
relate to very specic biological or social situations. The
Bruce eect reported from dierent mammalian taxa
describes the blocking of an early pregnancy in reac-
tion to the confrontation to a new, unknown male. It
probably has high energetic costs for the female, espe-
cially if a broader, less mechanistic denition of the
pregnancy termination also in later stages of the preg-
nancy is applied. The adaptive value has been debated
as a counterstrategy to potential future infanticide by
the new male (infanticide avoidance hypothesis), but
also lab artefacts were considered since in rodent species
the eect was reported only from laboratory conditions.
We (Eccard et al. 2017) showed in rodents in experi-
mental, near natural conditions that the Bruce eect
was restricted to isolated, breeding pairs and may be
adaptive in uctuation rodent populations during low
density phases. We also found that half of the test
females replaced pregnancies when encountering a newmale while the other half did not, which raised questions
about the adaptive value and biological function of the
process, potentially in mate choice.
In the proposed project we experimentally disentan-
gle potential adaptive and mechanistic explanations for
pregnancy replacements, focussing rather on the replace-
ment than the termination function, using a small rodent
system in near natural, controlled conditions. Low pop-
ulation density forces females to reproduce with their
relatives, but in the event of encountering a migrant
male, pregnancy replacement may allow the female to
increase her genetic dissimilarly to sire (inbreeding avoid-
ance). Further, the process could be a mechanism of
sequential mate choice and should thus depend on the
relative quality of original and replacement male (male
quality). Hypotheses will be tested in near natural con-
ditions, and infanticidal tendencies of each male will also
be monitored. Further, the dynamic interaction of the
animals will be tracked with proximity loggers to reveal
triggers of pregnancy replacement, e.g. mate guard-
ing, harassment, avoidance (behavioural, mechanistic
explanations).
The candidate is expected to run experiments in large
outdoor enclosures with the help of a technician, to breed
and phenotype animals with dierent degrees of related-
ness and male quality (dominance ranks), to collect and
analyse automated tracking and encounter data. Expe-
rience working with small animals, willingness working
outdoors also mornings and evenings (life trapping),
technical abilities while using the customized encounter
logging system (calibrations, soldering, systematic error
searches), fun and experience with R statistics, scientic
writing skills are desired, some of these can be learned.

We are seeking a highly motivated student for a funded
MSc or PhD position in the Schott Lab at York Univer-
sity. The position is part of an NSERC-funded research
program that seeks to understand the evolution of verte-
brate visual systems and how they develop and adapt in
response to dierent sensory environments. This is ac-
complished using an integrative approach that combines
comparative genomics and evolutionary computational
analyses with targeted experiments to provide a com-
prehensive view of visual system evolution and function
at multiple organizational scales. Available projects in-
clude: (1) examination of ontogenetic patterns of visual
gene expression and function in frogs and salamanders
with dierent life histories; (2) investigation of con-
vergent and novel mechanisms of visual evolution and
regression during fossorial adaptation in amphibians
and squamate reptiles; and (3) determination of the
evolutionary and developmental origins of a novel pho-
toreceptor type found in amphibians. These projects
will use approaches such as transcriptome sequencing
and dierential gene expression, whole genome sequenc-ing and genome-wide approaches to estimate relative
evolutionary rates, single-cell RNA-seq, and cellular
imaging. During the graduate program, students are
also encouraged to develop their own research projects
specic to their interests. The successful candidate will
join an open and inclusive research environment and
have the opportunity to interact with an international
group of collaborators.
The ideal candidate will have research experience, inter-
est in molecular evolution and sensory systems, strong
communication skills, and strong performance in science
courses. Experience with -omics research and bioinfor-
matics is preferred, but not required.
The position will begin Fall 2022. Interested students
should send a current C.V. and a brief letter of interest
to Dr. Ryan Schott schott@yorku.ca. More information
about the Schott Lab at YorkU is available at https:/-

Dear All,
At the Department of Animal Ecology (AnE) of the
Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) we are
looking for a population ecologist (tenure-track/senior
researcher) to join our team. Research in AnE centres
around the evolutionary and population ecology of an-
imals, and combines long-term population studies of
birds with experimental work in aviary and waterbird
facilities with the use of avian genomic tools.We are cur-
rently looking for somebody that works at the interface
of individuals and populations, and that is willing to
use our long-term populations studies of hole-breeding
passerines (four populations, 1955-present) and share re-
sponsibility for the data collection in these populations.
We are looking for an enthusiastic scientist with several
years of post-doctoral experience in an international
context, an excellent track record in evolutionary or
population ecology in terms of both publications and
the acquisition of research grants, and experience in su-
pervision of PhD students. The successful candidate will
be expected to develop exciting new research questions
and build a strong research line within the department,
with clear links to the research of the other scientists at
AnE (see https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/department-animal-
ecology) and to play an active role within the Depart-
ment, the NIOO research themes and the institute.
Importantly, the candidate's research will make exten-
sive use of AnE's unique long-term research on pop-
ulations of hole-breeding passerines in the wild (four
populations, 1955-present) focusing on the interface be-
tween individual- and population-level research. With
this appointment, AnE aims to promote diversity and
inclusion. As such, women and people from underrepre-
sented and minority groups are especially encouraged to
apply. Scientists at NIOO have no obligation to teach
at University level, but supervision of external Mas-
ter's and PhD students is expected as part of normal
research activity. Scientic communication is carried
out in English, so knowledge of the Dutch language is
not a prerequisite for this position, but a commitment
to learning the language is expected in longer-term sta.
Appointment The Tenure track/ Senior Researcher posi-
tion will be hosted at NIOO-KNAW, Wageningen. Thefulltime position (1,0 FTE) is for a tenure track or a
senior researcher position. Tenure track appointments
will be on a temporary basis for a maximum of six
years. After three and ve years of employment there
will be an assessment of performance based on criteria
that will be specied at the appointment. Based on
these assessments the researcher may be promoted to
the rank of senior researcher with tenure. Depending on
your experience, the maximum gross salary is euro 5,211
per month (scale 11) in accordance with the Collective
Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities, excluding 8%
vacation allowance and an 8.3% year-end bonus. In-

**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2022 - Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB annually oers mobility grants for young scientists
in his name.
Closing date: FRIDAY, 21 JANUARY 2022.
*Eligibility:*
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and ESEB
members. In addition, applicants will be considered
who are more than 6 years from the start of their PhD
if they have had career breaks, worked part-time, or for
other reasons have not worked continuously. Applicants
who have previously received a Godfrey Hewitt mobility
award are not eligible. The maximum single award will
be 2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or
a period of research at a lab that you have not previ-
ously visited. There is no restriction on the country of
residence or nationality of the applicant.
Due to the COVID-19 situation, and in order to pro-
mote responsible and safe travel without compromising
the quality of research, grantees of the 2022 ESEB God-
frey Hewitt mobility awards will be allowed to travel
within 24 months from the date of announcement of the
winners.
*Application procedure:*
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Moniatte at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from your
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded fromDecember 1, 2021 EvolDir 71
your home institution or your proposed host institution.
Please renew your ESEB membership or join the society
preferably only in January, as ESEB is changing its
membership system at the end of 2021.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Constantino Macias Garcia. The aim will be to an-
nounce decisions before the end of March 2022. The
committee will consider the following key criteria:
1. The value of the proposed mobility in terms of its
expected output and impact on the applicant's career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant's existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant's own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant's career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.
Best wishes, Ute Moniatte, ESEB Oce Manager.

Evry France MasterIntership
StatQuantGenomics
Title: Master internship in statistical modelling for
quantitative genomics
Duration: 6 mois
Location: Evry, France
Internship global context: The global population is es-
timated to reach approximately nine billion people by
2050, thus the demand for animal protein is expected to
increase by 76% [1]. Such an increase questions the sus-
tainability of our conventional food and feed production
systems. At the same time, we also need to reduce the
impact of agriculture on our environment [2]. Today,
insect production is considered a sustainable alternative
for food and feed production for several reasons. First,
the suitable nutritional composition of edible insects [3]
and second, the relatively low environmental impact its
production involves compared to other conventional live-
stock production systems. However, non-conventional
animal breeding raises the problem of adapted statisti-
cal and computational methods for genomic breeding
value prediction due to the nature of the pooled genomic
data and phenotypes estimates from dierent individu-
als while classical approaches use distinct genomic data
and phenotype per each individual.
Internship tasks: 1. Bibliography on state-of-the-art
statistical methods used in Genome Estimated Index
Value (GEBV) such as genomic best linear unbiased pre-
dictor (GBLUP) [4], ridge regression BLUP (rrBLUP)
[5], Bayesian LASSO (BL) [6], and reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS) regression [7]. 2. Testing of sta-
tistical approaches for GEBV with allele frequencies
inferred from pooled sequencing data (Pool-seq). 3. Im-
plementation of the algorithms in R 4. Performance
evaluation of the proposed algorithms on simulated and
real data sets.
Hosting laboratory: The six months internship will
takes place in the \Statistiques et G enome" team of
the Laboratory of Mathematics and Modelisation of
Evry (LaMME) in Evry, France http://www.math-
evry.cnrs.fr/sg/welcome . Supervision: The internship
will be supervised by Pr. Christophe Ambroise, Pro-

INTERNSHIP OFFER: Biodiversity screening-
MarineGEO-Hong Kong: Recording the pulse of the
ocean
Description and scientic objectives of the proposal:
Marine Global Earth Observatory (MarineGEO) is a
global network of partners focused on understanding
how coastal marine ecosystems function, and how to
help conserve biodiversity. We bring together simple
sampling technology (ARMS) and next-generation ge-
netic sequencing to ll the large gaps that still exist
when estimating marine biodiversity.
Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) is
a multi-layered settlement plate that mimic complex
marine substrates. It is designed as a passive and non-
invasive collector of marine understudied fauna, from
algae, corals, crabs, snails and worms, all without caus-
ing damage to the environment. While ARMS has been
deployed worldwide to explore the cryptic fauna, bac-
terial community, which are important component of
reefs ecosystems remain poorly studied.
ARMS are deployed for a period of 6 months to 1 year
in Hong Kong waters. Once retrieved, ARMS are dis-
assembled and photographed. Large specimens >2mm
that reside in the ARMS are collected and sorted into
taxonomic groups. Tissues of the specimens will be
extracted and sequenced for further identication.
The small motile fraction (106mm to 2 mm) is collected
by ltration. After collecting all mobile organisms, the
remaining sessile organisms on the AMRS are scraped o
plates. The DNA of the small motile fraction and sessile
fraction is extracted and amplied for metabarcoding
analysis.
The candidate will be responsible of DNA extraction
and amplication for barcoding analysis and help on the
eld if necessary. The project proposed for this research
internship aims to build an extensive database of marine
fauna in Hong Kong by the sample collecting process
stated above. With the data from dierent sites orga-
nized, we will analyze the impact of human activities
on biodiversity and community composition. Numerous
samples will be collected from the ARMS, therefore the
candidate will need to keep a good record of sample
information, sequences and photos.74 EvolDir December 1, 2021
Your qualications
Candidates should have experience and interest in DNA-
sequencing and ecology, and the skills to read an inter-
pret scientic literature. Experience of data organizing
using R and excel would be appreciated. The success-
ful candidate will have experience in molecular biology
laboratory work. A high level of written and spoken
English prociency is required.
Scientic and technical environment:
The successful candidate will perform the sequencing
and data organizing processes mentioned above. Dr.
Shelby McIlroy and Dr. Guibert Isis will be available
to guide the student through this process, but a level
of independent working is expected. The intern will
participate to all the MarineGEO eld work happening
during his stay.

CallProposals
SMBE SATELLITE, INTERDISCIPLINARY AND RE-
GIONAL MEETINGS - Call for Proposals
Each year, SMBE provides funds in aid for
SMBE SATELLITE, INTERDISCIPLINARY AND RE-
GIONAL MEETINGS.These meetings are organized
and held independent of the SMBE annual meeting.
SMBE is now calling for proposals for meetings and
actions to be held between Jan 2022 and Dec 31st 2022.
Funds will be awarded on a competitive basis to mem-
bers of the molecular evolution research community to
run workshops/meetings on an important, focused, and
timely topic of their choice.The number of awards will
depend on the quality of proposals and total cost. How-
ever, given the paucity of meetings for some time, we
may fund more proposals this year.
*** The deadline for submission of proposals has been
extended to 17th November 2021. ***
SMBE SATELLITE MEETINGS
These are workshops or small, topically focused meetings
with fewer than 100 participants that are organized and
held independent of the SMBE annual meeting. In the
past ve years, SMBE has supported multiple satellite
meetings on diverse topics, a sample of our most recent
Satellite meetings include:
- \Mitochondrial Genomics and Evolution" 2017
- \Evolution of microbes in natural and experimental
populations - synthesis and synergies" 2017
- \Molecular evolution and medicine" 2017
- \Evolution of genome architecture" 2017
- \Molecular evolution and the cell" 2018
- \Genome Evolution in Pathogen Transmission and
Disease" 2018
- \Modern Methods for the study of ancient DNA" 2018
- \Molecular Biology and Evolution of Cancer" 2019
- \Towards an integrated concept of adaptation: uniting
molecular population genetics and quantitative genetics"
2019
Satellite meetings awarded and postponed until further
notice due to COVID crisis:- \Evolution of Reproduction", Portugal.
- \Evolution of Meiosis", USA.
- \Mechanisms of Cellular Evolution", USA.
Please consult our archive for further information
on previous satellite, regional and interdisciplinary
meetings: https://www.smbe.org/smbe/MEETINGS/-
MeetingsArchive.aspx SMBE INTERDISCIPLINARY
AND REGIONAL MEETINGS.
SMBE will promote interdisciplinary research and ex-
tend its actions worldwide by sponsoring (1) joint meet-
ings with meetings of other societies; symposia or ple-
nary lectures on molecular biology and evolution at
meetings whose primary focus is not molecular evolu-
tion; (2) regional meetings outside the US, Europe, and
Japan; (3) small regional meetings in the US, Europe,
or Japan targeted towards PhD students and postdocs
with the purpose of helping them develop their presen-
tation skills and facilitate networking. This year, given
the various international COVID travel restrictions, we
are particularly interested in receiving applications for
regional meetings on any topic that falls within the
research scope represented by our society.
Most recent SMBE Regional and Interdisciplinary meet-
ings were:
- \Israeli Society of Evolutionary Biology inaugural meet-
ing", Israel, December 2019.
- \Evolutionary genomics at the human-environment
interface", Malawi, September 2019 (regional) https://-
smbe-malawi.org/ - \Population Genomics of Mobile
DNA", USA, 2019 (interdisciplinary)
- \Regional workshop on Computational Biology", Mex-
ico, 2019
- \Satellite workshop on Genome Evolution in Pathogen
Transmission and Disease", Japan, 2018
Guidelines for satellite, interdisciplinary and regional
meetings
- SMBE will provide nancial support for up to 80% of
the cost of each satellite meeting, up to a maximum of

SouthAfrica Volunteer
SmallMammalEvol
Volunteers needed January-April 2022
Minimum stay 2 months
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of Small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
(NOTE: This is an unpaid volunteer position)
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
solitary living, and social exibility in bush Karoo rats
and the striped mouse. The focus will be on costs and
benets of solitary living in bush Karoo rats, deter-
mining its social organization and social structure. As
this species is diurnal and the habitat is open, direct
behavioral observations in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Applicants must have
an interest in working in the eld and with animals.
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5:30 and
6 AM), and stops its activity with dusk (7 PM). Workduring nights might also be necessary. Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40?C during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of a
small social group. There is no internet, no telephone,
and no cell-phone reception at the research station.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of small mammals; direct behavioral
observations in the eld. Volunteers are expected to
help with maintenance of the research station (water
pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1900 (around 100 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food in Springbok. Including extras (going out
for dinner; shopping), you should expect costs of about
500 Euros or 600 US $per month. Students can get an
invitation letter to apply for a travel grant at their home
university / home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa close
to Namibia. The vegetation consists of Succulent Ka-
roo, which has been recognized as one of 25 hotspots
of biodiversity. It is a desert to semi-desert with rain
mainly in winter (June to September).
Corona situation: Only vaccinated persons are allowed
to stay at the research station. No visitors are allowed.
Students are not allowed to go on leave during their
stay. We have Corona measures at the station that vary
with the local situation. Travel to and entry into South
Africa is allowed when you have a negative Corona test.
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers for
the period January to April 2022. Volunteers must stay
for a minimum of 2 months.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@iphc.cnrs.fr. There is
no deadline, but applications are continuously reviewed.

UHolar Iceland
BrainGeneExpressionIntership
Hello everyone,
The Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology, H olar
University, Iceland, is looking for an intern student (from
bachelor to masters, or even DUT/BTS, ...) for a project
about brain gene expression related to cognitive abilities
in the Arctic charr. See advert below:
Hosting structure : Department of Aquaculture & sh
Biology, H olar University - Iceland & University of Ice-
land, Reykjav k - Iceland
Dates : 4 to 6 months from June 2022, very exible and
discussable
Gratication : 80 000 ISK per month (around 530 euro
/month)
Context of the study: Comparative studies might give
an insight on how cognition has evolved across taxa. The
evolution of spatial cognition is of a particular interest
because all animals depend on navigational skills to nd
food or mates, retrieve the nest and escape predators.
Hence, spatial cognitive abilities have an impact on indi-
viduals' tness and are consequently subject to natural
selection. In that sense, spatial cognitive abilities in
each population should be locally adapted to its partic-
ular ecological conditions. The Icelandic Arctic charr
(Salvelinus alpinus, AC) is found as several sympatric
morphs thriving in very dierent types of habitats, from
anadromous to benthic and pelagic lake-resident morphs.
We hypothesize cognitive abilities and behavior to be
shaped according to both evolutionary history and cur-
rent ecological factors, implying dierential expression
patterns of genes linked with spatial cognition and neu-
rogenesis between populations. The project is led by
Pr. David Benha m (lead PI, H olar Univ.) in collabo-
ration across H olar Univ. (Pr. Bjarni K. Kristj ansson,
Dr. Camille Leblanc), University of Caen, France (Dr.
Christelle Jozet), IFREMER, France (Dr. Marie-Laure
B egout), INRA, France (Dr. Xavier Cousin) and Uni-
versity of Iceland (Pr. Zophon as J onsson).
Student project: The student will specically identify
molecular clues underpinning behavioral and cognitive
ability dierences between populations, morphs and
environments. This will be done by monitoring genes
expression patterns in several brain structures of o-spring from three wild AC morphs raised under complex
vs. plain conditions, that underwent personality and
spatial learning tests. To do so, the student will perform:
* RNA extractions from several brain regions * Reverse
transcription * qPCR with specially developed PCR
primers for a set of genes involved in neurogenesis, neu-
ral plasticity and stress regulation * DNA extraction,
PCR & gel electrophoreses to genetically sex the test
individuals. * If interested, the student will also analyze
and interpret the data obtained.
This work will be carried out in Reykjav k at the Uni-
versity of Iceland. The student will be working in close
collaboration with a PhD student, Marion Dellinger.
Requirements: The candidates must be enrolled in a de-
gree in the elds of biotechnology or genetics, or relevant
equivalent elds. Meticulousness, experience in labora-
tory manipulation and a solid sense of organization are
required. The ideal candidate has a strong interest in
pluridisciplinary research with an emphasis on neuro-
sciences and is willing to improve lab bench skills. S/he
enjoys working in a dynamic group but should be able
to work independently as well. Statistical skills will be
a plus. Working language will be English.
Organizational details: Iceland is eligible for Erasmus+
grants.
Application: Applicants should send an application let-
ter, with a statement of research interests and relevant
experience and curriculum vitae as a single pdf to both
Pr. David Benha m (benhaim@holar.is) and Marion
Dellinger (marion@holar.is). Requests for further infor-
mation can be sent at the same email addresses.
All the best,

tion Unit, University of California, Davis
We seek a highly motivated candidate with a back-
ground in population genomics and evolution to ll
a postdoctoral researcher position. The objective of
this project is to characterize how genomic variation
among CA populations of mule deer is shaped by ge-
ographic and environmental variation, and how these
factors underlie phenotypic variation and local adapta-
tion. An additional objective is to assess the frequency
and geographic distribution of deleterious alleles clini-
cally relevant to Chronic Wasting Disease (e.g., MHC,
PPN, etc.), the extent of genetic load, and the threat
this pathogen poses to mule deer in California.
Responsibilities: The successful candidate will be re-
sponsible for study design, whole genome resequencing
library construction, bioinformatic processing of Illu-
mina short-read data, and analysis of SNP variants to
determine genomic diversity and adaptive dierentiation
between populations from contrasting natural environ-
ments. The postdoc will have access to a newly gener-
ated Odocoileus hemionus chromosome-level reference
genome assembly along with whole genome resequenc-
ing data for 100's of individuals, as generated under
the California Conservation Genomic Project (https:/-
/www.ccgproject.org/). The postdoctoral scholar will
also be responsible for manuscript preparation as lead
author.

Feeds
The Therkildsen and McIntyre Labs at Cornell Uni-
versity, in partnership with the Environmental Defense
Fund's Oceans Program and WorldFish, are hiring a
postdoc for a project aiming to map out the sources of
sh used to feed the global expansion of aquaculture.
The postdoc position will oer leadership opportunities
in two main areas. First, building on earlier metabar-
coding work, we will explore the potential to leverage
cost-eective shotgun sequencing approaches to examine
the taxonomic composition and relative abundance ofDecember 1, 2021 EvolDir 83
key constituents in aquaculture feeds collected world-
wide. The resulting species lists will be used to assess
the global geography of connections between the harvest
of wild sh and the production of farmed sh. Second,
we will engage with industry and NGOs to pave the way
for integrating metagenomic tools into next-generation
standards for aquaculture sustainability certication.
The ideal candidate will have completed a PhD by
January 2022, have strong skills in molecular ecology
(metabarcoding, metagenomics, and bioinformatics ex-
perience is especially relevant), demonstrated interests
in sheries and sustainable food systems, and a strong
publication record commensurate with career stage. We
will favor applicants with experience and commitment
to outreach eorts that generate real-world impact from
research results. We expect the postdoc to help design
and execute genetic analyses in the lab, and to lead
bioinformatic data processing and biogeographic infer-
ences. Equally important, the postdoc will work directly
with NGO, industry, and trade association partners to
explore the role that DNA-based ingredient tracing can
play in making aquaculture feed supply chains more
sustainable. This project is a collaborative eort and
will require a team-oriented approach, as the postdoc
will work closely with both Cornell PIs, other academic
collaborators, and our NGO partners.
The start-date is exible, but could be as early as Febru-
ary 2022. A competitive salary and benets package will
be provided, and residence in Ithaca, NY is expected.
The postdoc will join a vigorous multidisciplinary com-

of Adaptation and Systems in Evolution (BASE) of the
joint research unit Quantitative Genetics and Evolution
(GQE) - Le Moulon in Gif-sur-Yvette. The project ad-
dresses evolutionary aspects of meiotic recombination
through three main questions: how recombination rate
responds to directional articial selection, what are the
genetic determinants underlying that response, and the
interplay between recombination and the dynamics of
adaptation to stress. Evolution experiments are per-
formed by chaining generations of sexual reproduction
from an initial population with high standing genetic

ExperimentalEvolution
A postdoctoral researcher position is available to in-
vestigate the evolution of evolvability in microalgae.
The project is a collaboration between Tobias Uller
(http://feiner-uller-group.se/) and Charlie Cornwallis
(http://www.charliecornwallis.org/) at the Department
of Biology, Lund University, Sweden. Funding is initially
available for three years.
Summary: Recent theory predicts that the evolution of
plasticity can modify the distribution of phenotypes
accessible through genetic mutation (the 'genotype-
phenotype map'). This, in turn, may inuence the
course of evolution and how organisms adapt to new
challenges. This project aims to put this body of theory
to the test, using a combination of experimental evolu-
tion, phenotypic and genetic engineering, and analyses
of metabolic, transcriptomic and genomic data. The
project is part of an international research programme
(https://www.biologicalpurpose.org/) that provides ex-
cellent opportunities for career development. The pre-
ferred start date is some time during the rst quarter
of 2022, with some exibility.
Your role: You would contribute to the design and run-
ning of selection lines of unicellular algae, carry out
experimental assays, collect and analyse phenotypic,
genetic and transcriptomic data, and disseminate the re-
sults. The position oers opportunities to develop your
own research interests and supervision skills. We encour-
age collaborations within and outside Lund University.
The project is well supported by technical personnel
that assist with the daily running of experiments.
Your qualications: We look for someone with a strong
interest in evolutionary biology, prior experience of ex-perimental evolution and laboratory experiments on
unicellular organisms, and/or working with genomic or
transcriptomic data. You must have a PhD in a rele-
vant area, and should demonstrate a commitment to

Lyon EvolutionaryEcology
Dear colleagues,
Please nd a post-doc position in evolutionary ecology
in Lyon, France. All the informations are below:
A post-doctoral position is available at LBBE, Labora-
toire de Biom etrie et Biologie Evolutive, Lyon, France
(https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/fr) with the CrashPest ANR
project. The candidate will work with Prof Emmanuel
Desouhant (emmanuel.desouhant@univ-lyon1.fr) and Dr
Laurence mouton (laurence.mouton@univ-lyon1.fr), PI
of the project.
The CrashPest project aims at developing a novel
method to control pest populations of insects. This
method takes advantage of intrinsic demographic pro-
cesses: /Wolbachia/-induced cytoplasmic incompatibil-
ity, a form of conditional sterility which allows these
bacteria to spread in host populations, combined with
an Allee eect arising from mating disruption. The
idea is based on a recent theoretical study which hy-
pothesized that the transient decline in population size
caused by a successful invasion of /Wolbachia/ could
drive the population below its Allee threshold, and con-
sequently, to extinction. The species under study is the
pest /Drosophila suzukii/.
Within this general framework we are seeking a post-
doc experienced in behavioural experimental work with
insects, in the theoretical context of sexual selection
and life history evolution. The candidate will explore
the behaviours of males searching females in a con-
text of mating disruption and then test experimentally90 EvolDir December 1, 2021
the eect of conspecic density on the probability of
nding a sexual partner. This experiment will provide
information on the component, mate-nding, Allee ef-
fect underpinning mating disruption. Moreover, the
candidate will investigate the inuence of /Wolbachia
/(presence, density and strain) on sexual selection (/i.e./
mate choice, strength and direction of sexual selection)
with a focus on mate choice that may limit the invasion
of the two exotic /Wolbachia/ strains into the natural
system.
The position (salary: between 2675 et 3805 euro per
month before taxation according to experience)would
be for 18 months. To apply, please prepare a one-page
cover letter explaining your interest, with the names and
email addresses of two people with rst-hand knowledge
of your past research experience. Please, add a curricu-
lum vitae including a publication list (2 pages max.).

NCU Poland InsectPhylogenomics
NCU Poland.Phylogenomics
Apply by: 31th December 2021
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in insects phylogenomics,
Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru n
The research group led by Dr Andrzej Grzywacz at the
Nicolaus Copernicus University (Poland) is looking for
candidates for a postdoc position to work within the
project entitled: \A large-scale phylogeny and evolu-
tion of immature stages in megadiverse family Muscidae
(Diptera)". The position is for a period of 1 year. Start-
ing date no later than 1st March 2022. The purpose of
this project is to use various next generation sequenc-
ing (NGS) approaches to reconstruct a phylogeny of
dipteran family Muscidae and investigate evolutionary
histories of larval morphology and feeding strategies.
Scope of the project: Insects representing more than half
of living species reached astonishing evolutionary success
and an amazing variety of natural histories. Studying
evolutionary histories within certain insect lineages will
allow to understand how the majority of organisms di-
versity on Earth evolved. The evolution of phenotypic
traits depends on many factors. In consequence two op-
posite patterns of rates of morphological diversication
may occur, i.e., rapid phenotypic changes or long-term
phenotypic stasis in evolutionary lineages. On the other
hand, particular habitats may elicit evolution of over-
all similar morphological traits. To overcome the issue
of constraints in trait's ability to change, organisms
may adapt to new local environments by means of in-
troduction of phenotypic innovations. In this project,
using megadiverse dipteran family Muscidae, app. 5 200
species, as a model group we will investigate whether
adaptations to various feeding strategies within certain
lineages of living organisms may lead to certain struc-
tural changes. Since taxonomic relationships within
Muscidae remains questionable, we will use various next
generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to reconstruct
a large-scale phylogeny of Muscidae. Subsequently, we
will identify traits of immature stages morphology con-
served across Muscidae clades and will use them as a
corroboration of certain nodes in phylogenetic tree to
build a new robust classication system. Taking the
advantage of phylogenetic comparative methods, we will
investigate whether certain modications of immature
stages morphology in various Muscidae lineages are cor-related with feeding strategies such that feeding strate-
gies in Muscidae reect certain modications in larval
morphology. Subsequently we will perform a stochastic
mapping to infer the ancestral feeding strategy and an-
cestral traits of larval morphology of Muscidae to explore
their evolutionary histories and investigate mechanisms
involved in adaptations to local environments.
Scope of work: - performing laboratory work, i.e. DNA
extractions, library preparation, enrichment with UCE
baits, sequencing - bioinformatic processing of raw se-
quences for the phylogenomic analysis - participating in
phylogenetic analyses - working closely with other mem-
bers of the group - participating in data analysis and
interpretation of the results - writing publications with
other members of the team - presentation and dissemi-
nation of the obtained results in the form of conference
talks and scientic papers
Requirements: - PhD degree in biological sciences or
a related area, awarded or to be awarded before Jan-
uary 2022, but no earlier than 7 years ago - experience
in the molecular lab work, including NGS techniques
- experience in bioinformatics concerning the analysis
of genomic data for phylogenetic purposes - skills in R,
python or another programming language - theoretical
knowledge on phylogenetics and evolutionary biology -
uency in English - enthusiasm for science - communica-
tion and organizational skills - creativity, ability to work
independently and in collaboration with other scientists
Desired qualications: - record of publishing in peer-
reviewed literature, - awards resulting from scientic
work, scholarships, participation in workshops and sci-
entic projects - experience in working with insects will
be an advantage
We oer: - an employment contract (post-doc po-

Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Quantitative Evolution-
ary Ecology
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher in quanti-
tative evolutionary ecology to ll a three-year position
available at the Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, De-
partment of Biology, NTNU, Norway. Closing date Dec
13th 2021.
The Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD) is a lead-
ing cross-disciplinary Centre of Excellence, with primary
interests in population ecology, evolutionary biology and
community dynamics. CBD works at the interface be-
tween biology and mathematical sciences and strives
to apply cutting-edge theoretical and statistical frame-
works to eld data to resolve key questions in the con-
texts of both fundamental and applied science. Further
information is available at http://www.ntnu.edu/cbd
About the position This postdoctoral position repre-
sents an exciting opportunity to help lead advances at
the interface of evolutionary quantitative genetics and
statistical and movement ecology.
Wild populations experiencing locally deteriorating en-
vironmental conditions can in principle persist through
phenotypic plasticity or micro-evolution, or by moving
elsewhere. While these three mechanisms have each re-
ceived considerable attention, we still know little about
how they can act in combination, for example through
micro-evolution of the degree of plasticity in seasonalmovement.
The primary aims for the postdoctoral position are
to apply advanced quantitative genetic analyses to a
multi-year dataset from a wild bird population to es-
timate forms of plasticity and genetic variation in the
occurrence of seasonal migration versus residence, specif-
ically focusing on early life (i.e. pre-recruitment years).
Achieving these objectives will require linking quantita-
tive genetic animal model analyses with capture-mark-
recapture analyses.
The post will suit a quantitative ecologist, evolutionary
biologist or ecological statistician with interest in apply-
ing advanced statistical methods to quantify patterns,
causes and consequences of phenotypic variation arising
in wild populations. There will be scope for the post
holder to innovate and develop particular aspects of the
work programme.
The post is part of a research project funded by the
Research Council of Norway (RCN). It is a three-year
temporary position, which will advance the post holder's
qualications to work in senior academic positions.
The post holder will work with Professor Jane Reid and
Dr Paul Acker at CBD, NTNU, with further support
from statistician Associate Professor Stefanie Mu. This
team can provide further training and support in the
required analyses. The post holder will also work closely
with a PhD student and three further postdoctoral re-
searchers at CBD, and with the research team of Dr
Francis Daunt, CEH, UK, utilizing the available eld

OxfordU VirusHostGenomics
We are seeking to hire a post-doc to investigate paired
virus and host genomics at Oxford University.
Project description: The aim of the project is to use
paired host-virus genomics to understand why patientsrespond dierently to infections. We are sequencing
host and virus genomes from large patient cohorts in-
fected with HCV, HBV and HIV. These cohorts are
very well characterised and many clinical phenotypes
and biomarkers are measured on all individual. The
aims of this study are (1) to identify host polymorphisms
that drive evolution of the virus, (2) identify host and
virus genetic polymorphisms that drive dierences in
clinical phenotypes and measured biomarkers indepen-
dent of each other and (3) detect interactions between
host and virus genetics that drive the dierences in clin-
ical phenotypes and measured biomarkers. The role can
be focused on dierent aspects of the project depending
on your interest and experience for instance on the host
genomics and GWAS or on virus genomics, evolution
and epidemiology. Depending on your experience you
will be involved in development and implementation
of new statistical approaches to look for interaction
between host and pathogen genetic markers and asso-
ciations (possibly nonlinear) with multivariate clinical
outcomes.
Requirements: A PhD with a strong quantitative com-
ponent, particularly population genetics, bioinformat-
ics, computational biology, statistics or probabilistic
machine learning, computer science or other relevant
elds. Experience of working with large datasets is nec-
essary. Computational skills to include experience of
using statistical packages such as R, MATLAB or oth-
ers. Experience of developing computational pipelines
and analytical strategies for complex data sets, espe-
cially pathogens. Candidates must be able to express
themselves in spoken as well as written English.

to study Cumulative Culture in AI. Our aim is to better
understand the human capacity for cumulative culture
by developing AI that can distill and transmit social
information in a human-like manner. Key ingredients of
human social learning we want to model in AI systems
include: representational exchange between social and
individual learning systems, compositionality of individ-
ual knowledge with social information, and the inference
of causal structure from partial/failed solutions. Just as
the ???cultural explosion??? launched the success of the
human species, a similar capacity for cultural learning
has the potential to unlock more robust, interpretable,
and compositional forms of AI. Note that the exact
topic and subtopics are exible and will depend on the
interests of the candidate. For inquiries, please contact:
charley.wu[at]uni-tuebingen[dot]de

human behavior and social learning (Dr. Charley
Wu; hmc-lab.com), with ground-breaking compara-
tive research into the emergence of culture in hu-
mans, hominins and great apes (Dr. Claudio Tennie;
sites.google.com/view/claudiotennie/home).
The ideal candidate should have a strong computational
and mathematical background, for instance, in machine
learning, reinforcement learning, multi-agent simula-
tions, cognitive modeling, or a related area. This po-
sition is particularly suited for promising researchers
recently nished or about to nish their PhD in a rel-
evant discipline, such as cognitive science, computer
science, psychology, computational neuroscience, statis-
tics, or biology. A PhD must be completed before the
start of the position.
Candidates should have worked in or have a strong pas-
sion for studying cultural evolution, social learning, andcognitive science, with a general interest and capacity
for interdisciplinary research. Please indicate in your
application if you have prior experience with conduct-
ing human experiments, computational modeling, and
machine learning, which are benecial but not required.
Skills in programming languages (e.g., Python, R, Mat-
lab, Javascript, Java, etc.), developing online or VR
experiments, writing (in English), and the ability to
independently manage a project (of any type) should
also be mentioned.
What we oer: The position is funded by the T??bingen
AI Center, which is associated with University of
T??bingen and is the highest ranked academic insti-
tution in articial intelligence in the European Union.
In addition, the position is also embedded in the Ma-
chine Learning excellence cluster and the Department of
Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology. There are no
formal teaching duties, allowing full exibility for con-

UKentucky Phylogenetics
PopulationGenetics
The Weisrock Lab at the University of Kentucky is looking for a postdoc to join the lab and work on research
related to ongoing phylogenetic and/or population genetic projects. Current data-ready research projects include
a phylogenomic investigation of diversication of salamandrid salamanders (i.e., the newts). The hired postdoc
would also have opportunities to participate in the development of new research projects.
The Weisrock Lab research program comprises a broad range of interests, with no one major research focus,
or taxonomic system. Generally, we use DNA sequence data to study patterns of genetic variation within and
between species, and we use these data to learn more about the histories and processes that have shaped these
patterns. This includes very ne-scale studies of variation within species to learn, for example, how changing
environments or human-mediated factors are inuencing populations, to the comparison of genomic data from
divergent species separated by millions of years to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and learn something
about species diversication.
Because Dr. Dave Weisrock is the Chair of UK's Biology Department, postdocs in the lab are relied upon to both
lead a research project, while also working closely with the rest of the lab to facilitate normal operations. This
includes interacting with undergraduate and graduate students and providing general help with lab organization
and activities (e.g., lab meetings). Ideally, the candidate will have experience with computational methods (basic
scripting and running packages in R or Python, and familiarity with common phylogenetic and population genetic
programs) and will have a research publication record that aligns and/or complements the research program of
the Weisrock Lab. The candidate will be comfortable working both independently and as part of a team.
The initial appointment of this position is for one year, with potential reappointment available after a rst-year
review. Salary is competitive and includes benets. The ideal start date is January 2022 but can be exible for
the right candidate.
A Ph.D. in Biology or related eld is required and experience in evolutionary, phylogenetic, and/or population
genetic research is preferred.
The University of Kentucky is a research-intensive (R1) institution located in Lexington, a city with many
opportunities for outdoor adventures, arts, and culture. The University of Kentucky is an excellent place to be a
postdoc, with a favorable cost-of-living:salary ratio, as well as many other labs engaged in exciting evolutionary
research. Our lab is part of a large, diverse Biology Department with ~30 tenure-track faculty, ~12 postdocs,
and~50 graduate students. We expect new postdocs to be active members of this collaborative and supportive
environment.
The Weisrock lab values diversity and is committed to creating a safe, welcoming, and supportive lab environment.
Applications from candidates with related scientic interests who are also passionate about diversity, equity, and
inclusion in STEM are strongly encouraged.
Applicants should submit a cover letter describing your interest and t for this position and a current CV. In
addition, please provide the names and contact information for two references when prompted in the academic
prole. This information may be utilized to solicit recommendation letters from your references within the
employment system.
Applications received by December 17, 2021 will be given full consideration, although all applications will be
considered until the position is lled. If you're interested in the position, please contact Dr. David Weisrock
(david.weisrock@uky.edu) and/or current postdoc Dr. Katie Everson (kathryn.everson@uky.edu) for further
information.
Given the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to protect our university community including our students, sta,
faculty and visitors, the University of Kentucky is requiring COVID-19 vaccination for all new hires prior to
starting employment. Therefore, as of October 18, 2021, all new hires prior to their rst day of employment
must submit appropriate documentation showing, i) completion of the rst vaccination against COVID-19, or ii)
completion of the full vaccination series against COVID-19, or iii) approved exemption (medical contraindications
or a sincerely held religious belief) through the formal exemption process from the COVID-19 vaccination
requirement. For those employees who have completed the rst vaccination against COVID-19 prior to their106 EvolDir December 1, 2021
rst day of employment, the second vaccination (if applicable) must be completed following the vaccination
recommended schedule to be considered fully vaccinated.

AnimalMitochondrialGenomics
We are opening a two year post-doc position at the Universit >1
2de Lyon, France.
The postdoctoral researcher will join the ANR MINIGAN project which aims to study the causes and consequences
of conicts between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes on sexual reproduction in a hermaphroditic gastropod.
Recently, the MINIGAN consortium discovered individuals in the freshwater gastropod Physa acuta with a highly
divergent mitochondrial genome associated with male sterility. These male-sterile individuals constitute, together
with hermaphroditic individuals, natural gynodioecious populations (coexistence of hermaphroditic individuals
and only female individuals). The postdoctoral fellow will be in charge of the acquisition and comparative analysis
of several hundred mitochondrial genomes from natural populations, in order to better understand the diversity,
distribution and evolutionary origin of sterilizing mitochondrial genomes. He/she will also use a transcriptomic
approach to characterize the functional changes associated with male sterility.

FlourBeetleNicheEvolution
The Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity at the University of M >1
2nster, Germany, is seeking to ll the
position of a
Postdoctoral Research Associate
(salary level TV-L E 13, 100%)
from the earliest possible date. The position is within the externally funded project SFB/TRR 212. We are
oering a xed-term full-time position until 31 December 2025 corresponding to the duration of the project.
Your tasks:
The position is part of the Collaborative Research Centre (SFB/TRR 212) entitled: A Novel Synthesis of
Individualisation across Behaviour, Ecology and Evolution: Niche Choice, Niche Conformance, Niche Construction
(NC3), by the German Research Foundation (DFG).
This project focuses on individualised niches in the red our beetle Tribolium castaneum, an upcoming and
genetically tractable insect model species. Flour beetles modify the microbial community of their environment
(the our), which is mediated by chemical secretions from the beetles. The successful candidate will be involved
in an ongoing project that aims to experimentally study, if and how the processes of niche construction and
evolutionary capacitance facilitate evolutionary adaptation. It involves testing the hypotheses that (1) chemical
communication via CHC proles provides the basis for the transfer of individual experience into a group of beetles;
(2) epigenetic processes contribute to the rapid adaptation facilitated by niche construction and evolutionary
capacitance; and (3) rapid adaptation to new temporal niches is facilitated by evolutionary capacitance.
The successful candidate will draw on an ongoing experimental evolution study and existing beetle lines to
identify the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of evolved phenotypes, and study the chemical ecology of
beetle communication and biological rhythms of beetles in relation to cryptic genetic variation that may facilitate
temporal niche adaptation.
Our expectations:
The successful candidate will be a highly motivated scientist, interested in interdisciplinary work. They will have
a doctoral degree (or a comparable qualication) in biology, preferentially with a focus on evolution, behaviour,
ecology, genomics or related elds. They will also have a background, and ideally some postdoctoral experience,
in at least one of the following areas: practical insect work, molecular skills, genomics and bioinformatics, as well
as a good understanding of statistics. They will also have excellent communication skills and be able to work
both independently and as part of a multidisciplinary team. The working language of the Institute and the lab is
English, and good prociency in spoken and written English is a requirement. German language skills are not a
requirement, but a willingness to learn is desirable.
Advantages for you:
The Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity provides a stimulating research environment with a number of scienticDecember 1, 2021 EvolDir 111
groups researching diverse topics centred on dierent aspects of evolution. As a part of the Collaborative Research
Centre SFB/TRR 212 (https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/verbuende/sfb nc3/), the
project will involve intensive collaboration with consortium partners at the Universities of M >1
2nster and Bielefeld.
The town of M >1
2nster itself has many students and presents a dynamic environment with many cultural and
social events throughout the year (http://www.muenster.de/en/).
The University of M >1
2nster is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to increasing the proportion
of women academics. Consequently, we actively encourage applications by women. Female candidates with
equivalent qualications and academic achievements will be preferentially considered within the framework of the
legal possibilities.
The University of M >1
2nster is committed to employing more sta with disabilities. Candidates with recognised
severe disabilities who have equivalent qualications are given preference in hiring decisions.
Positions can generally be lled as part-time positions if there are no compelling work-related reasons against
doing so.
Are you interested?
Then we look forward to receiving your application, written in English, in one single pdf le, by 15 December
2021. Applications should be sent to Prof Joachim Kurtz at: Joachim.Kurtz@uni-muenster.de. Please note that
we cannot consider other le formats. Applications should include 1) a cover letter with a statement of research

Job description Position as post doc available at Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, Department
of Biosciences.
The position is for a period of 3 years. Starting date no later than 01.03.2022
No one can be appointed for more than one Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Oslo.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate for a three-year post doc position as part of this exciting
collaborative research project between the University of Oslo, University of Nottingham (UK) and the Netherlands
Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW). The researcher will help develop our understanding of the evolutionary
origins of human-commensalism in Passer sparrows. The project will focus on two key questions; 1) does human
commensalism have a single origin within the house sparrow? and 2) has adaptation to a human-commensal
niche occurred in parallel in the tree sparrow?
We aim to combine morphological and genomic data from existing datasets, museum samples and ongoing
eldwork to address the core aims of the project. The successful candidate will be allowed to choose aspects of the
larger program as best ts their skills and research interests. They will also be encouraged to develop additional,
complementary avenues of research. The researcher will oversee population-level whole genome resequencing
from the wet-lab to data interrogation and will be expected to be procient in bioinformatics (R/Unix/Python)
with documented skills in genomic analyses. A PhD in population genetics/genomics, evolutionary genomics,
evolutionary biology or a related subject is necessary. Experience with working with birds and bird genomes would
be helpful but is not a requirement. The researcher will be based at the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary
Synthesis at the University of Oslo but will also be expected to visit the University of Nottingham (UK) for
additional training and support with research visits to the Netherlands. There will likely be opportunities for
eldwork in Central and Southern Asia. The working language of the research group is English.
It is becoming exceedingly clear that humans have been, and still are, drastically altering the planet. Although
human activity typically has a negative eect on biodiversity, some species have rapidly adapted to novel niches
opened up by human activity. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a successful human commensal that
thrives in human created niches. It has adapted to urban and agricultural habitats on every continent except
Antarctica. Intriguingly, a number of other Passer sparrows are also human commensals having likely experienced
similar selective pressures; one of the most striking is the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), which is an
obligate commensal across much of East Asia. The overarching aim of this newly funded project (Norwegian
Research Council) is to determine the evolutionary causes and consequences of human commensalism in Passer
sparrows using whole genome resequencing, high resolution phenotyping and extensive eldwork.December 1, 2021 EvolDir 113
The main purpose of a postdoctoral fellowship is to provide the candidates with enhanced skills to pursue a
scientic top position within or beyond academia. To promote a strategic career path, all postdoctoral research
fellows are required to submit a professional development plan no later than one month after commencement of
the postdoctoral period.
Qualication requirements: The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences has a strategic ambition to be
among the leading communities for research, education and innovation in Europe. Candidates for these fellowships
will be selected in accordance with this, and expected to be in the upper segment of their class with respect to
academic credentials.
- Applicants must hold a degree equivalent to a Norwegian doctoral degree in evolutionary biology/genetics/genomics.
Doctoral dissertation must be submitted for evaluation by the closing date. Only applicants with an approved
doctoral thesis and completed defence are eligible for appointment. - Fluent oral and written communication
skills in English is required
Desirable qualications:
- Experience in bioinformatics including in Unix, python and/or R - Experience with population genomic analyses
and reconstructing evolutionary histories - Experience in using high-powered computer clusters and resources - A
demonstrated record of published scientic research in population genomics, evolutionary biology, evolutionary
genetics

Suggested headline: USalford.PrimateGenomics
Dr Robin Beck, Prof Jean Boubli, and Dr Ian Goodhead at the University of Salford, UK, are currently
undertaking a three year (September 2020-August 2023) NERC-funded grant for a project entitled \Rise of the
Continent of the Monkeys". This project aims to reveal the genomic changes underlying phenotypic adaptations,
the major drivers of diversication, the role and relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors, and the
processes that have shaped the adaptive radiation of a highly diverse (170 living species) clade of South American
mammals, the New World primates, since their origin ~35-45 million years ago. As part of this grant, we are
able to a bioinformatics/genomics-focused postdoctoral position for 18 or 19 months, depending on start date
(preferred start date is early January 2022). The purpose of the genomics-focused role is to investigate the
phylogenetic relationships, diversication, and trait evolution of New World primates through time using a range
of genomic/bioinformatic approaches.Specically, the role will comprise the following major research objectives:
Using new whole genomes representing every NWP genus to i) identify positive selection, inactivation and/or
changes in copy number in genes known to be associated with diet, activity pattern and body size in mammals;
ii) reconstruct likely ancestral phenotypes; iii) determine number, direction and timing of transitions between
phenotypic traits Accurate resolution of the number of living NWP species and their phylogeny using coalescence-
based methods for phylogeneticanalysis and species delimitation Production of a total evidence phylogeny that
combines our phylogenomic dataset with an existing morphological dataset that includes both extant and fossil
taxa using \tip-and-node" dating and the Fossilised Birth-Death model Comparative analysis of phylogenies to: i)
identify major shifts in diversication rate through time; iii) determine whether diversication rate shifts are

ModellingEvoTransitions
Postdoctoral Senior Research Fellow in Theoretical Biology/Computer Science (1573721FP)
Project: Connectionist Approaches to Modelling Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality (evo-ego)
Application Deadline: **23rd Nov 2021** Salary: 39,739 to 44,706 GBP*
We welcome applications for a postdoctoral researcher to build computational models of evolutionary processes,
at the lab of Richard Watson at the University of Southampton. The position is available, for a duration of up to
25 mths, starting Jan 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.
About the project:
This project (funded by the John Templeton Foundation) investigates the evolutionary transitions in individuality,
such as the transition from unicellular life to multicellular organisms. The approach will build on recent
developments unifying evolutionary theory with learning theory (Watson & Szathmary, 2016, TREE, 31(2),
147-157). This work converts (connectionist) models of distributed learning and cognition, already well-developed
in computer science/neural networks/machine learning, to deepen and expand our understanding of natural
evolution. The candidate will use computational modelling to explore the evolution of network structure and its
eect on ecological/developmental organisation and evolutionary capabilities. This will characterise the type of
relationships and organisation that is needed to convert a collection of (previously) independent evolutionary
individuals into a new level of organisation that functions and evolves at a new, higher level of individuality. In
particular, we will explore the hypothesis that the conditions that enable evolution to exhibit a transition in
individuality are predicted by the conditions that enable learning systems to induce and exploit deep models,
a.k.a. deep learning.
The successful candidate, based in Southampton, will also work with co-investigators Chris Buckley (University
of Sussex, UK.) and Mike Levin (Tufts University, USA). As a part of this team, the candidate will also work
closely with PhDs and another post-doc dedicated to this project and on related projects.
The candidate:
Appropriate skill sets include computational modelling of gene-regulation networks, ecological dynamics/community
network modelling, theoretical population genetics, mathematical modelling of biological evolution, social evolu-
tion theory, adaptive dynamics, evolutionary game theory, computational individual-based modelling, complex
adaptive systems, algorithmic/functional modelling of evolutionary adaptation.
Applicants must be capable of building bridges that link between evolutionary biology and computer science and
have a PhD or equivalent professional qualications and experience in either evolutionary theory (e.g. adaptation,
selection, evolutionary systems biology, mathematical biology, social evolution theory), with strong mathematical
skills and experience in simulation modelling/programming, OR |a PhD in computer science/maths/physics
(e.g. algorithms, machine learning, complex systems/dynamical systems modelling, optimisation) with strong
knowledge/experience of working on applications in theoretical evolutionary biology.
Applications must include a CV, publications list, the names of three referees and a covering letter explaining
your current interests and relevant background.
Equality, diversity and Inclusion is central to the ethos in the School of Electronics and Computer Science. We
particularly encourage women, Black, Asian and minority ethnic, LGBT and disabled applicants to apply for this
position. We are committed to improving equality for women in science and have been successful in achieving

Dqqmy5-RxGg/project-details/10275367), and an anticipated R01 to start in early 2022. Broad descriptions of
the projects include:
* The R01 focuses on investigating the demographic history, genetics of metabolic traits, transferability of risk
stratication models, and community outreach in Pacic Island populations (Native Hawaiians, Samoans). *
The R35 broadly investigates the consequence of natural selection on present day human phenotypes, including
method developments infusing principles of population genetics into statistical genetic applications (for example,
see our latest preprint: Fan et al. bioRixv, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.18.456747v1 and
Chen et al. AJHG, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929720301610).
It is also possible to fund the postdoc position partly with unrestricted funds such as start-ups, and therefore
there is room for postdocs to explore research topic broadly consistent with the research direction of the lab. For
example, we have access to Taiwan Biobank genetic and phenotypic data, as well as whole genome sequencing
data from Saudi populations, that we can freely explore.
The position is for at least 2 years, starting at scale 5 of the NIH postdoc scale at minimum ( ~$62K USD per
year), and further scale with relevant experience. Because of the various ways the position can be funded, start
date is exible. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in genetics, computer science, bioinformatics, computational
biology, or a related eld. Prociency in one or more programming languages (e.g. python, perl, C++, R, etc.)
and in Unix-based computing environment is essential. Experience in conducting human genetics or population
genetics research and analyzing large genetic datasets is a plus, but not required. Applications will be reviewed

YaleU HumanEvolutionaryGenomics
The Reilly Lab in the Genetics Department of the Yale School of Medicine is seeking postdoctoral researchers for
funded projects to understand how genetic variants impact human health, evolution, and disease. We seek to
answer a fundamental question remaining in biology: \how do genetic changes lead to functional changes at the
molecular, cellular, and phenotypic level?"
We're especially interested in understanding the role of non-coding, cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the genome,
with a focus on variation within them. Genome-wide association studies have identied hundreds of thousands of
genetic variants associated with human health and disease, but mechanistic traction has been limited. Similarly,
natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation between populations and may still impact modern
traits or disease (e.g. height, sickle cell anemia).126 EvolDir December 1, 2021
The lab has three main foci: - Developing new, large-scale experimental screens to perturb CREs, and new
computational tools to model their function - Identifying evolutionary adaptive alleles likely impacting modern
human phenotypes - Applying these functional genomic tools to phenotypically interesting loci important for
human disease and evolution.
We're looking for inquisitive, creative, and passionate researchers to join our team. We're a multi-disciplinary
group with a variety of backgrounds including genomics, math, biochemistry, machine-learning, and population
genetics. Similar backgrounds are a good t, but many PhD or MDs interested in human evolution, building new
genomic tools, or analyzing complex data would nd a project in our lab. The lab prides itself on building an
inclusive, supportive, and collaborative environment, deeply committed to the tailored professional development
of all of the lab's trainees.
Find the job posting here: https://www.reilly-lab.com/news/hiring-postdoc-positions. Interested applicants
should email Steve (contact info: reilly-lab.com), briey describing your scientic interests, how they intersect
with our lab's interests, and include your CV. Post-doctoral applicants should also submit a Diversity, Equity,

Course overview:In this ve day course, we provide an introduction to
eco-phylogenetics and comparativeanalyses using R. We
begin by providing an overview on the use of phylogenies
as a tool forevolutionary biologists and modern tech-
niques to deal with large phylogenies and to incorporate
phylogenetic uncertainty in the analyses (day 1). We
then cover some of themost relevant eco-phylogenetic
analyses and provide examples from the community to
the macro-ecological scale (day 2-3). Finally, we in-
troduce a diversity of classic and modern phylogenetic
comparative methods to consider the historical relation-
ship of lineages ineco-evolutionary research, including
models of trait evolution, analysis of cladediversication
and the use of phylogenies in spatial distribution models
among others (day 4-5).

Feb7-10
Dear all,
we still have a few places left on the Physalia course
\Getting the most out of R", which will be held online
in February (7th-10th).
Many scientists start using R for very specic purposes
with little training in computer science, data organiza-
tion, and software development. Even advanced users
may bypass important tools and abstractions which can
ultimately lead to bad habits and wasting time. Get the
most of R by exploring topics that usually fall outside
of data analysis and visualization curricula. This course
will cover blind spots in existing materials by working
through the intermediate steps in various pairs of prob-
lems and solutions that often get overlooked because of
assumed knowledge.
R users in scientic elds with a moderate amount of R
and RStudio experience, for the most part self-taught,
overwhelmed by the amount of resources, and interested
in becoming more ecient.

phylogenies/ Course Overview Phylogenetic trees have
changed the way we study and understand life on Earth.
Taking phylogenetic information into account in our
analyses is critical to account for the non-independence
of biological data. Also, phylogenies allow us to get
a deep-time perspective of the processes that have
shaped the evolutionary history of groups, including
diversication and trait evolution. This course will
introduce participants to the use, modication and
representation of phylogenetic trees. Also, we will focus
on the use of phylogenetic information to reconstruct
ancestral characters and biogeographic histories, using
dierent phylogenetic comparative methods. This
course will also tackle trait evolution modelling and
the assessment of phylogenetic signal. Finally, we will
learn about the shape of phylogenetic trees and its
evolutionary causes, and how to estimate the rates
of diversication throughout the history of groups.
Participants are encouraged to bring their data sets
to use in the practical classes. The course includes an
optional rst introductory day to basic R. Important
note: Please bear in mind that this course is not about
reconstructing (building) phylogenetic trees. Software:

Course description This course on Landscape Genetics
provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary train-
ing and provides an overview of the eld of landscape
genetics. The course caters to students in basic and
applied ecology, conservation and population genetics,
landscape ecology, evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion biology. A key objective of landscape genetics is to
study how landscape modication and habitat fragmen-
tation aect organism dispersal and gene ow across
the landscape. Landscape genetics requires highly in-
terdisciplinary specialized skills making intensive use of
technical population genetic skills and spatial analysis
tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools and remote sensing).
Even when students receive disciplinary training in these
areas, educational programs often lack the necessary
linkage and synthesis among disciplines. This linkage
can only be accomplished after experts from each dis-
cipline work together to develop guiding principles for
this new research area.
Landscape Genetics will be concurrently oered at mul-
tiple universities across the globe, giving students the
opportunity to learn from international experts and
work with peers from outside institutions. For students
who are not members of the participating institutions,
we are oering a web-based online course to reach a
broader audience. Each course meeting will start with
a live web-cast lecture (no special software required) by
an expert on the topic that introduces foundations and
methods and highlights points for discussion in local
seminar groups. After breaking out into local course
group discussion (including a discussion group for on-
line course students), a web-based discussion across
campuses will wrap up the weekly topic. Students whoare unable to make it to live-cast of lectures can view
taped lectures. In addition, students can choose to
participate in an optional lab section using R and/or
interdisciplinary group term projects with web-based
collaboration across institutions. The nal two options
are provided to help students develop analytical skills in
Landscape Genetics. Students who participate in group
projects will have the option of applying to attend a
project synthesis meeting in Idaho in mid to late May.

Faculty who would like to add a local section of the
course at their university can register as a group or
multiple students at one institution can register as a
group. For faculty who set up local sections, we would
expect you to set up course credit at your institution,
participate in the course with the students and grade
assignments (we provide answer keys for assignments).
For individual students or students in small groups (
<4) without a local instructor who need course credit,
you can have your advisor set up an independent study
course at your home institution and turn in specic
assignments during the semester that will be evaluated
by our online instruction team. This can be set up as
pass/fail or grading on A-F scale. It is easiest for us if
you pick the pass/fail option. In the US system, this
would count as a 2 credit course for the lecture portion,
and students who choose to do all labs or participate in
a group project would receive an additional credit.
You will be invoiced for the course in early January and
can pay by credit card or check.

Online MetaAnalysisInR Mar7-10
Dear all,
registrations are now open for our course \Meta-analysis
in R".
Dates: online, 7-10 March
Course website:https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/metain-r/ We begin with an
overview of the systematic review and meta-analysis
process, including problem specication, search
methods, data extraction, quality evaluation, sta-
tistical analysis, model interpretation, and critique,
and results. Next, we will examine the parameter
estimation approach to statistical analysis (eect sizes,
condence/uncertainty intervals) and explore how
this approach can be used to quantify the results of
individual studies and the whole literature. Next, we
will explore how statistical artifacts, such as sampling
error, measurement error, and bias, can create the
illusion of inconsistency in ndings across studies.
Following these basic principles, we will explore methods
for statistically cumulating ndings across studies to
reduce biases using random-eects meta-analysis and
meta-regression. We will examine methods for mod-
erator analysis (stratied subgroups, meta-regression),
interpretation of average eects and heterogeneity, and
corrections for numerous statistical artifacts (sampling
error, measurement error, range restriction, and selec-
tion eects). Throughout, we will consider examples for
how to interpret results and present them using tables
and data visualization.
Next, we will examine methods for model diagnostics
and sensitivity analyses related to outliers and publica-
tion bias. We will explore modern methods for detection
and quantication of publication bias, as well as consid-
eration of problems associated with older approaches.
Finally, we discuss meta-analysis as part of the broader
systematic review process and introduce principles for

You will need your own laptop to use, have a recent
version of R, RStudio installed, and some other ap-
plications. We will send you details of software and
installation instructions with your registration acknowl-
edgement email.
Can I bring my own data?
We will provide experimental datasets for use during
the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop mov-
ing. There will be time, however, to discuss your own
datasets and how you might work with them outside of
the workshop.

GenomeAssemblyAnnotation
May23-25
Basic Assembly and Annotation of Genomes workshop
for May 2022.
This workshop is designed for individuals who would like
to learn how to use DNA sequence data to generate an
annotated genome. We invite post-baccalaureates, post-
doctoral students, other academics and non-academic-
track individuals. We anticipate that students from a
broad array of disciplines will participate. This includes,
conservation biologists, phylogeneticists, evolutionary
biologists, human and plant pathologists, participants
in many health professions.
This workshop will be largely hands on training with
Teaching Assistants working with you in small groups.
There will be 4 sessions, each preceded by a few short
lectures by experts in the eld. Tuition and boarding
fees are not yet set but it will be aordable. You may

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
