Granada FloralEvolution Mar14-16
Dear all,
>From EvoFlor (evoor.org) we are pleased to invite
you to the 16th Annual Meeting of the Spanish Group
for Floral Ecology EcoFlor2019 . This year the meeting
will take place in Granada (Spain) from Thursday 14
to Saturday 16 of March of 2019. The University of
Granada and its Faculty of Sciences allow us the space
to hold the meeting in the center of the city.
This year and continuing with the tradition in EcoFlor
we will have *plenary talk sessions* and the classic talks
and discussions. However, we have some novelties for
this year. We decided to include *poster contibutions*
that will be exposed during all the meeting to promote
the questions and discussion on them. To open EcoFlor
to non-Spanish speakers, *this year any communication
presented must be in English*. Probably the relaxed
atmosphere will allow some discussions to start in En-
glish and end in Spanish and vice versa. The beers will
denitely help with this. This year we also want to con-
tinue with one of the original ideas of EcoFLor meetings,
picked up last year by the organizers of the EcoFlor in
Mallorca, organising a couple of *round table discussion*
on some topics of general interest in order to generate
discussions in the audience. In addition, we will also
have a couple of *workshops* for the day before: rst
on *creativity in science* organised by *Isabel Reche*
and *Francisco Perfectti *and a second on *i**ntegral
projection models *organized by *Maria Paniw* and
*Irene Mart n*. The number of participants in both
workshops are limited and it will be decided by strict
registration/application order.
Plenary speakers and talks (so far):
*Dr. Mar a Clara Castellanos* University of Sussex.
United Kingdom
Talk title: *Selection and heritability in the wild: un-
derstanding oral trait stasis and evolvability*4 EvolDir November 1, 2018
*Prof. Gonzalo Nieto-Feliner* Real Jard n Bot anico de
Madrid. Spain
Talk title: *The role of hybridization in evolution. Hy-
brid speciation, adaptive introgression and no man's
land in between?*
The registration is now open till January 15th.
You can nd the form for registration and abstract
submission in the EcoFlor2019 website: https://-
ecoor2019.weebly.com/. You can also contact me for
further questions.
We would really appreciate if you help us to disseminate
this information to everyone interested.
Thank you and all the best,
Moha

This will be an interdisciplinary meeting to explore the
use of single cell technologies to understand the function,
diversity and interactions of microbes. This meeting
aims to bring together physicists, microbiologists and
genomicists, and evolutionary biologists who are trying
to sample microbes and understand where they branch
on the tree of life. There will be an opportunity to
present a poster in the poster session. The deadline to
submit a poster abstract is Monday 22 October.
More information on how to submit a poster, view the
programme of talks and how to register can be found

20th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
#2018YSF
Date: Friday, 23 November 2018, 9:30 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre,
Natural History Museum, London, UK
http://systass.org/young-systematists-forum/ The an-
nual Young Systematists' Forum represents an exciting
setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoctoral re-
searchers to present their data, often for the rst time,
to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy, system-
atics and phylogenetics. This well-established eventNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 7
provides an important opportunity for budding system-
atists to discuss their research in front of their peers
within a supportive environment. Supervisors and other
established systematists are also encouraged to attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE.
Send applications by e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com , supply-
ing your name, contact address and stating whether
or not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English and in
Word format no later than Friday 26 October 2018. The
body text should not exceed 150 words in length. Ti-
tle, authors, and their professional aliations/addresses
should be included with the abstracts. If the presen-
tation is co-authored, the actual speaker (oral) or pre-
senter (poster) must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
The le should be in editable format (.doc or .odt, not
pdf) and titled Surname First-name YSF2018.doc, for
example Doe Jane YSF2018.doc.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further infor-
mation about the meeting, including abstracts, by
e-mail one week in advance. This information will
also be displayed on the Systematics Association web-
site (http://systass.org/young-systematists-forum/ <
http://www.systass.org/ >).

of the Society for the Study of Evolution, the American
Society of Naturalists, and the Society of Systematic
Biologists, to be held June 21-25, 2019, in Providence,
RI.
Proposed symposium topics should support the Soci-
etys goal to advance the conceptual unication of the
biological sciences and further knowledge in evolution,
ecology, behavior, and organismal biology. Proposals
should be synthetic and interdisciplinary, and address
important emerging issues in evolution, ecology, or be-
havior. A budget of $8,000 for travel, registration, and
accommodation is provided to help defray expenses.
Proposals should include (1) a title; (2) a description of
the symposium topic (one page); (3) a list of six speak-
ers, including institutional aliations, who have agreed
to participate in the symposium; (4) a justication for
the symposium explaining why the topic and speakers
are appropriate for a Society-sponsored symposium (up
to one page).

as a single pdf attachment, under subject heading: ASN
Symposium Proposal: Evolution 2019. Proposals that
include women, young investigators, and individuals
from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged.
The Societys selection committee will evaluate proposals
based on the signicance and timeliness of the topic,

UMiami EvolutionaryDemography
Jan10-12
Announcing the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Evolution-
ary Demography Society to be held January 10-12 in
Miami, FL at the University of Miami, Coral Gables.
The Evolutionary Demography Society, founded in 2013,
is focused on conceptual integration across disciplines,
most notably human demography and evolutionary bi-
ology (but also ecology, sociology, anthropology, epi-
demiology, public health). Both demography and evolu-
tionary biology are quantitative studies of population
processes. Human populations are currently undergo-
ing profound changes in age-structure, age-patterns of
mortality and life expectancy with signicant societal
and public health consequences.
We are dedicated to hosting a mix of early/late career
participants and to providing novel organizational tech-
niques to promote scientic interactions at our confer-
ences across a breadth of elds. The meetings alternate
between Europe and North America. Our rst annual
meeting, in 2013 at the University of Southern Denmark
in Odense, Denmark, hosted by Jim Vaupel, attracted
more than one hundred participants and subsequent
meetings have been of similar size. They were held
at Stanford University, Stanford, CA; Lunteren, the
Netherlands; the University of Virginia, Charlottesville;
and the Domaine Saint Joseph at Sainte-Foy Les Lyon,
Lyon, France. Our goal at the meetings is to maximize
participation and interactions among researchers.
We do not have concurrent sessions, we have one session
with short presentations: Keynote Speakers give 20 min
talks (with 5 additional min for questions) and lightning
speakers give 5 min \lightning" talks (with 3 min for
questions). Posters may be submitted in conjunction
with talks or on their own. We have long coee breaks
and ample time for informal interactions. Usually the
afternoon of the last day is devoted to Workshops.
You are invited to: (a) pre-register on our meeting in-November 1, 2018 EvolDir 9

AMNH NewYork
ComparativeBiology
American Museum of Natural History Richard Gilder
Graduate School Comparative Biology Ph.D. Program
and Graduate Fellowships Program
The AMNH RGGS Ph.D. Program in Comparative Biol-
ogy is training the next generation of biologists through
an integrative approach that focuses on the history, evo-
lutionary relationships, and interactions among species.
It utilizes the Museum's strength and experience in
research and training to educate a new generation of
scientists and industry leaders. The AMNH provides ex-
ceptional support facilities for student research, with col-
lections of more than 33 million specimens and artifacts.
Training and research opportunities exist across a wide
array of disciplines in comparative biology, incorporating
research in systematic and evolutionary biology, pale-
ontology, conservation biology, comparative genomics,
computational biology, Earth history, anthropology, and
biological and cultural diversity. Global eldwork, with
AMNH faculty, student-led or in partnership with others,
provides exceptional research opportunities for students.
RGGS students may take advantage of RGGS course
cross-enrollment agreements with partner universities
Columbia and the City University of New York. Armed
with a Gilder School education, graduates will not only
understand the history and diversity of life on Earth, but
may contribute to advances in human health, biodiver-
sity conservation, and other related biological research
elds as well.
This is an accelerated program, designed for students
to complete their degrees in four years. Students will
earn a minimum of 62 credits through a combination of
coursework, teaching assistantships, and individual dis-
sertation research. The Richard Gilder Graduate School
will typically provide full nancial support to students
matriculating in the Comparative Biology Ph.D. Pro-
gram.
We also oer Graduate Fellowships for students inter-
ested in earning a Ph.D. at one of our partner institu-
tions (Columbia University, CUNY, NYU, Stony Brook
and Cornell University), when they are advised by an
AMNH curator.
The AMNH Graduate Student Fellowship Program is
an educational partnership with selected universities,
dedicated to the training of Ph.D. candidates in those
scientic disciplines practiced at the Museum. Our
current collaborations are with Columbia University,City University of New York (CUNY), Cornell Univer-
sity, Stony Brook University, and New York University
(NYU). The host university in which the student en-
rolls exercises educational jurisdiction over the students
and formally awards the degree. In these partnership
programs, at least one Museum curator must serve as a
graduate advisor, co-major professor or major professor,
and adjunct university faculty member. Each student
benets by having the sta and facilities of both the
university and the Museum to support his/her training
and research. To be eligible for the AMNH Graduate
Fellowship, students must apply to both the host Uni-
versity's Ph.D. program and to the AMNH Graduate
Student Fellowships Program. Students already matric-
ulated in a Ph.D. program are not eligible to apply; only
new, rst-time Ph.D. applicants will be considered.

AuburnU BiologyEducationResearch
The Biology Education Research lab at Auburn Univer-
sity is looking for graduate students with an interest in
Biology Education Research (BER) and STEM equity
to begin in Fall 2019.
The Ballen lab conducts investigations into the causes
and consequences of gaps in science literacy, and how
educators can design their courses to minimize barriers
to success. By developing an integrated experimen-
tal and theoretical research program we explore how12 EvolDir November 1, 2018
classroom and social inuences shape student learning,
personal and professional development, and educational
and career trajectories.
Here is our website: https://balle027.wixsite.com/-
cjballen Here are some examples of broad questions we
are addressing in the lab: What geographic, cultural,
or institutional barriers predict patterns of attrition
among historically underserved students in STEM at
the undergraduate level? What types of scalable teach-
ing strategies can instructors employ to reduce gaps
in performance and participation? How do research
experiences impact developing scientists' personal and
professional development and career trajectories? How
can we use measures of physiological reactivity to study
engagement in an undergraduate STEM classroom set-
ting?
Auburn supports a large community in our Department
of Biological Sciences ( http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/-
departments/biology/index.htm). Students can apply
at the M.Sc. and Ph.D. level. While a background and
course work in statistics is preferred, it is not required.
Applicants should have a strong biology and analyti-
cal background, as demonstrated through transcripts,
recommendation letters, or publication record.
Several of the DBS faculty are interested in a co-
mentoring model where part of the dissertation would be
focused on biology education research and part would
be focused on a biology laboratory or eld research
question. If you are interested in this approach, please
contact me and let me know which additional mentors
are of interest to you.
Auburn is a fantastic, aordable college town, and DBS
is a vibrant and collaborative setting for discipline-based
education research. We have great resources here to
study education, oering a wide range of opportunities
for expanding your skill set.
Application for admission to the DBS graduate pro-
gram can be found here: http://www.auburn.edu/-
cosam/departments/biology/grad/index.htm. Materials
include a CV, personal statement, ocial transcripts,
three letters of recommendation and ocial GRE score.
If you are interested in joining the lab as a graduate
student, send me an email at mjb0100(at)auburn.edu

We are looking for a MSc students for the following
position:
Functional dierences in southern right whale genomes
linked to population structure and foraging traditions
Principal supervisor: Dr Emma Carroll ^ a e\
e.carroll@auckland.ac.nz, University of Auckland
Co-supervisors: Assoc. Prof. Rochelle Constantine,
Prof. Oscar Gaggiotti (University of St Andrews), Dr
Alana Alexander (University of Otago)
Funding: This MSc is fully funded for one year of re-
search, covering both domestic (New Zealand) student
fees and a stipend of $NZ17,000 for one year.
Description: Southern right whales are a large baleen
whale species that have undergone a dramatic popula-
tion bottleneck due to historical whaling and are now
recovering in parts of their historical range. The species
shows typical baleen whale migratory patterns, moving
between winter breeding and socialising grounds and
summer feeding grounds. There is genetic and stable
isotope evidence that this migratory delity shapes pop-
ulation structure across the species distribution. In
particular, this behavioural mechanism, in combination
with historical environmental processes, is hypothesised
to have led to signicant genetic dierentiation between
recovering wintering grounds. Here we seek a MSc stu-
dent to undertake the rst survey of genomic data to
look for functional genetic dierences between southern
right whale wintering grounds and between foraging
ground traditions. The research project will be based
on the analysis of already-generated, ddRAD and whole
genome data and will use genome scan methods to de-
tect regions of the genome that show dierences. There
is no eldwork component to this project.
Aims: What are the functional dierences at the genome
level between southern right whales (1) in dierent pop-
ulations and (2) that forage on dierent prey species or
regions?
Candidate Requirements: We seek an enthusiastic, moti-
vated candidate with a genetic/genomic, bioinformatics
or molecular ecology background and knowledge of pop-
ulation genetic theory. The ideal candidate would alsoNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 13
have experience with coding, or otherwise being willing
to learn, for example, python, R, and/or bash scripting.
We especially encourage students from under-
represented groups in STEM (e.g. M Aori, Pasika,
lower socio-economic status students, rst generation
university students, women).
Entry requirements are either BSC(Hons) with a GPA
of at least 4 or a PGDipSci in Biological Sciences (for
specic PGDipSci requirements please email).
Further information: Prospective applicants are encour-
aged to contact Emma Carroll e.carroll@auckland.ac.nz
to discuss the project. Starting date either 1 December
2018 or 1 March 2019.

We are looking for a PhD student for a project on sex-
ual networks and alternative mating tactics in the rock
hyrax. The student will be supervised by Drs. Amiyaal
Ilany and Lee Koren.
The project involves extensive eldwork 6 months a year
in the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, Israel.
The ideal applicant has a strong background in behav-
ioral ecology, eld experience handling wildlife, and data
analysis skills.
For more information, please contact Dr. Amiyaal Ilany

(USC) are seeking graduate student (PhD) applicants to
Georgetown University to work on a study of maternal
eects in wild bottlenose dolphins, funded by the
National Science Foundation. Competitive applicants
should have a strong quantitative and theoretical
background in genetics and behavioral ecology. Refer

for additional information. Deadline is December 1.
General Project Description: While several studies link
sociality to tness in long-lived mammals, maternal
inuence on inter- and intra-individual variation in so-
ciality (e.g. dynamic social patterns) and tness out-
comes is relatively unexplored. Recent computational
advances allow this project to incorporate multi-level,
dynamic variation to advance understanding of how so-
ciality evolved, i.e., transmission pathways. This study
system, a 35-year longitudinal study of wild bottlenosedolphins, provides a unique opportunity to address these
questions because of species characteristics, and the size,
detail, and long-term nature of the dataset. This project
will use: (1) novel quantitative genetics methodologies
to unravel the importance of maternal eects on so-
cial behavior while accounting for both additive genetic
variation and the mothers' social environment; (2) next-
generation sequencing combined with demographic data
to construct accurate pedigree information from high-
density single nucleotide polymorphisms; (3) dynamic
social network modeling (social association/interaction
matrices) to account for changing social attributes of
individuals rather than just static traits. As such, this
study will be a comprehensive exploration of how ma-
ternal eects impact social traits over the lifespan and
across more than one generation within an evolutionary
framework. In addition, this is the rst study to do so
in wild long-lived mammal with extensive maternal so-
cial transmission, while accounting for additive genetic
variation. The results will provide signicant advances
by extending our study of the genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms of inheritance, which play critical roles in
evolution and responses to environmental change.

IndianaStateU EvoDevo CichlidFish
Graduate student (PhD) positions in eco-evo-devo of
African cichlid shes
The Gante Lab (https://www.indstate.edu/cas/-
biology/people/dr-hugo-gante) in the Department
of Biology and The Center for Genomic Advocacy
at Indiana State University has openings for highly
motivated, talented and passionate graduate students.
We use integrated genetic, genomic and computational
approaches to study color pattern development and
evolution, and the genomics of adaptation. We use
freshwater sh as our main model systems, particularly
African cichlids, to disentangle the molecular and
developmental mechanisms underlying adaptation and
speciation. Prospective research projects for incoming
graduate students include:
- Color pattern development and evolution. Color pat-
terns are important for mediating social communication,
sexual selection and to escape predation. To under-
stand how color patterns develop and evolve in the color
pattern-rich African cichlids of the genus Neolampro-
logus, we are combining analyses of dierential gene
expression between phenotypes, comparative genomics
across species and populations along a continuum of
genetic and phenotypic divergence, with developmental
analyses of pattern formation, including chromatophore
cell-cell interactions. We are interested in examining
the functions and regulation of candidate color pattern
genes in great detail.
- Mechanisms mediating adaptation to extreme environ-
ments. Adaptation to new, often extreme environments
oers an excellent opportunity to understand the molec-
ular basis of evolutionary (adaptive) phenotypic changes.
We are looking at how genomic dierences between di-
vergent populations and species translate to dierences
in phenotypes (e.g., life history, morphology, behavior).
We are interested in examining the functions and regu-
lation of genes involved in adaptation in further detail.Financial support for graduate students is available
through research assistantships, teaching assistantships,
and fellowships.
Job Requirements:
The applicant should have a BA or BS degree, taken the
GRE, and possess a strong undergraduate knowledge of
genetics, bioinformatics, and/or developmental biology
with relevant lab experience. Possession of a Masters
degree or previous research experience, particularly with
zebrash or stickleback, is considered a plus.
How to Apply:
Contact Dr. Hugo Gante directly at

interest, a CV, unocial transcripts, GRE scores, and
names and contact information for three references.

We are seeking one MSc student to join the Centre for
Evolutionary Ecology and Ethical Conservation (http:/-
/ceeec.wordpress.com) at Laurentian University to be
part of the recovery strategy for the Northern Leopard
Frog in Western Canada in partnership with the Calgary
Zoo.
This species is currently part of a conservation breeding
and recolonization program. To determine the likelihood
of success, the student will assess two key characteris-
tics. First, considering that the captive bred frogs should
show similar genetic diversity to the wild populations,
what is the genetic composition of the remaining Leop-
ard frogs and is a rescue needed to increase genetic
diversity? Second, given that the captive bred frogs
must have adequate disease resistance, which in the case
of the common chytrid infection is conveyed principally
through the skin microbiome, what are the eects of18 EvolDir November 1, 2018
captivity on the microbiome of the Leopard frog?
In this context, the student will work by combining
eldwork, population genetics analyses and experiments
depending on his/her interests. Good aptitude for eld-
work, molecular ecology skills and some herpetological
knowledge are expected as well as good communication
skills.
Starting date: Candidates are expected to commence
their studies between January and March 2019.
Funding: Full funding of approximately $25,000/year is
guaranteed for 2 years through a combination of TAships
and RAships. Additional scholarships will be available
by competition.
How to apply: Interested students should contact us via
email, including a cover letter describing background
and interests (including specic interests in my lab), cv,
transcripts (unocial is ne).

only (no classes and teaching required). The position
should start on 1 January 2018 or as soon as possible
thereafter.
My group is broadly working on theory and compu-
tational methods for Bayesian inference of phylogeny
(http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna). The
research directions include phylogeny inference, diver-
gence time estimation, diversication rate estimation
and model testing. All of our methods are imple-

www.RevBayes.com) which is the successor software of
the popular program MrBayes. The successful applicant
will be part of our vibrant RevBayes group and will con-
tribute to further development of the program. There
will be opportunities for the successful applicant to work
with and visit the research groups of my collaborators
in Europe and the USA. Furthermore, I expect the can-
didate to become actively involved in our RevBayes
workshops and hackathons.
I have recently been awarded an Emmy Noether grant
from the DFG (German Science Foundation) which will
fund at least 3 positions over the next 5 years. This
advertisement is for one of these positions and the appli-
cant will start in a young, dynamic and rapidly growing
group. My group will be moving to the GeoBio-Center
of the LMU Munich, one of Germany's and Europe's
top Universities (#32 world-wide; #8 in Europe; #1

distance to the historic city center (Marienplatz) andNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 19
English Garden (city park with 3.75 km ^A2area). The
GeoBio-Center is highly interdisciplinary and consists
of researchers from dierent departments including pa-
leontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, zoology
and botany.
The main research topic for the PhD project is robust es-
timation of gene trees. Today we have several databases
with whole genomes which we would like to use to build
phylogenetic trees. However, dierent genes have dif-
ferent evolutionary histories. To be able to understand
why gene trees are discordant, we have to be able to
estimate gene trees correctly in the rst place. Thus,
we need to develop realistic models of the substitution
process for each gene. For example, we need to develop
and test time-reversible and non-reversible substitution
processes, lineage-heterogeneous substitution processes,
etc. The foundation of these models is already imple-
mented in RevBayes. The PhD student will apply and
explore dierent substitution models and, depending on
the results, develop the next steps for robust gene tree
inference.
Applicants should have a Master's degree, completed or
completion imminent, in evolutionary biology, computer
science, mathematics, statistics, or a related eld. Some
knowledge and experience in programming (C++, Java,
Python or R), phylogenetic inference as well as Bayesian
statistics is benecial. Training in these skills will be
provided depending on need. The thesis will be written
in English. No knowledge of German is required but
some basic knowledge will be helpful outside of work.
Enthusiasm, determination and the capacity to work
independently are essential. Own ideas complementing
the current research direction are highly appreciated.
The position will be compensated according to the stan-

PhD Position in Evolutionary Behavioral Ecology
At the Behavioural Ecology group of the Ludwig Max-
imilians University of Munich we are seeking a PhD
student who is eager to study reproductive trait evo-
lution in eld crickets. The project specically aims
at understanding the role of pre- and post-mating sex-
ual selection in shaping male traits, from ejaculates
to behavior. The position is funded by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and will run for 3 years,
starting from January 2019.
Description: The project will make use of the eld
cricket Gryllus bimaculatus as an insect model system
to understand how sexual selection shapes complex male
phenotypes by quantifying the relative contribution of
pre- and post-mating selection to male reproductive
tness and key reproductive traits (behaviour, morphol-
ogy, and ejaculates) across changing social environments.
The use of experimental evolution lines will be core to
the study, involving multiple approaches and covering
a diverse array of techniques such as behavior assays,
sperm trait analyses, and molecular paternity assign-
ment. The work will be entirely lab based with yearly
eld trips to collect animals.
Requirements: The candidate should have a Masters
degree. Students with various skill sets are encouraged
to apply but a background in behavioral ecology and
evolutionary biology is essential. Experience with molec-
ular tools is desirable, as well as experimental work with
arthropods. We are seeking for a student willing to work
independently and keen to join a highly international
work group.
Application (in English): The candidates should provide
- CV - Motivation letter with brief description of experi-
ences relevant to the research project - Relevant study
certicates and record of exams - 2 letters of recommen-
dation (preferably from Bsc and Msc supervisors)

AlternativeSplicingEvolution
We oer a highly collaborative PhD project between
three research groups (Haerty: bioinformatics, Wheeler:
cell and developmental biology, Edwards: developmental
and molecular biology) combining computational biology
and experimental developmental biology to investigate
the diversity and functional during Vertebrate devel-
opment of alternatively spliced transcripts originating
from genes of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metallo-
proteinase with /thrombospondin type I motifs) family.
The PhD student will gain expertise in computational
biology, large datasets analysis, transcriptomics, arising
long read sequencing technologies, genetics, microscopy
and developmental biology gaining highly transferable
skills.
Nearly all the genes in human undergo alternative splic-
ing, the process through which dierent transcripts are
generated from a single gene. Despite the observation
of the universality of alternative splicing in Eukary-
otes, tissue and developmental stage specic regulation
of splicing, and the importance of this mechanism in
fundamental biological processes, much remain to be
discovered regarding the function of alternatively spliced
transcripts.
The aim of the project is to provide a novel under-
standing of the importance and regulation of alternative
splicing in the ADAMTS gene family during develop-
ment. ADAMTS are secreted enzymes with roles in
tissue morphogenesis and patho-physiological remod-
elling. The student will apply combined computational
and experimental approaches to annotate and function-
ally characterize transcripts through in-situ expression
assays and gene manipulations in Xenopus.
This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Nor-
wich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NR-
PDTP). Shortlisted applicants will be interviewed as
part of the studentship competition. Candidates will be
interviewed on either the 8th, 9th or 10th January 2019.
The NRP DTP oers postgraduates the opportunity toundertake a 4-year research project whilst enhancing
professional development and research skills through
a comprehensive training programme. You will join a
vibrant community of world-leading researchers. All NR-

internship (PIPS) during their study. The internship
oers exciting and invaluable work experience designed
to enhance professional development. Full support and
advice will be provided by our Professional Internship

NematodeMitonuclearEvolution
Available at Portland State University, Portland, Ore-
gon: We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusias-
tic MS or PhD student to work on a National Science
Foundation-funded project that uses experimental ge-
nomics in *C. elegans* nematodes to study mitonuclear
evolution and the impact of sexual system on mitonu-
clear adaptation.
*Planned start date:* September 2019.
*Project Description: *Energy metabolism in nearly all
eukaryotic life forms relies on coordinated interactions
among gene products encoded by both mitochondrial
and nuclear genomes, and thus depends upon inter-
genomic coevolution. Neither the processes maintaining
this coevolution nor its downstream evolutionary conse-
quences are well understood. These consequences were
recently hypothesized to include the evolution and main-
tenance of sexual reproduction. This project leverages
the expertise and resources of three research groups
to provide the direct, non-retrospective tests of major
hypotheses to explain mitonuclear genome coevolution.
These hypotheses predict that integration of the two
genomes is achieved primarily by xation of nuclear
mutations that compensate for the deleterious eects
of previously acquired mitochondrial mutations, and
that this process will favor sexual recombination among
nuclear chromosomes. We will apply experimental ge-
nomics with *Caenorhabditis elegans* nematodes to
study evolutionary process within the context of the mi-
tochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the proper
functioning of which relies on the maintenance of fa-November 1, 2018 EvolDir 25
vorable mitonuclear epistatic interactions. The project
will take full advantage of the powerful *C. elegans*
system to: 1) Determine the impact of sexual system on
the tempo and patterns of mitonuclear adaptation. *C.
elegans* strains containing deleterious mitochondrial-
and nuclear-encoded ETC mutations will undergo labo-
ratory adaptation in replicate populations experiencing
obligate selng, facultative outcrossing, or obligate out-
crossing. This design also permits examination of how
rates of sexual outcrossing evolve in response to these
conditions. 2) Determine the evolutionary dynamics,
functional characteristics and sex-specic eects of indi-
vidual mitonuclear mutations. Genomic, bioinformatic
and phenotypic analyses will determine the molecular
bases and functional underpinnings of mitochondrial
and nuclear mutations available to mask the eects of
deleterious ETC mutations, and reveal the relationship
between rates of outcrossing and mitonuclear adapta-
tion.
*Location*: This project will be conducted under the
direct supervision of Dr. Suzanne Estes with informal co-
supervision from Drs. Vaishali Katju and Ulfar Bergth-
orsson (Texas A&M University). The work is based at
the Department of Biology at Portland State Univer-
sity, located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon.
The PSU Biology Department <https://www.pdx.edu/-
biology/ >, which houses the Center for Life in Ex-
treme Environments (CLEE) <https://www.pdx.edu/-
extreme-environments/ >, has 21 research faculty and
over 65 graduate students. Our faculty strive to take an
integrative approach to biology, encompassing all levels
of biological organization from molecules to ecosystems.
We collaborate and share facilities with other science de-
partments and with research faculty at Oregon Health &
Science University, a medical school and teaching hospi-
tal located adjacent to PSU. This close proximity helps
to foster interdisciplinary research and creates a vibrant
research culture that ensures support and training for
the next generation of evolutionary biologist.
*Requirements:* We are looking for a biology graduate
who has a strong interest in evolutionary and molec-
ular biology. Some practical experience in molecular,
bioinformatic and/or *C. elegans* husbandry techniques
is highly desired, but additional training will be pro-
vided. The successful candidate will be enthusiastic,
highly motivated, independent, and have a relevant
bachelors degree. The applicant must meet standard
Portland State University graduate admissions and
language requirements, details of which can be found
here: https://www.pdx.edu/graduate-admissions/apply.
Note: ONLY US citizen or permanent resident appli-
cants are eligible for this studentship.
*Funding Notes: *The successful candidate will receivea full studentship including tuition, fees and an annual
living stipend of $24,000 for up to 4 years for PhD stu-
dents. Funds will also be available for research expenses
and conference travel. Support beyond this time period
may be available through a PSU departmental Teaching
Assistantship.
*Deadlines and Contact: *The deadline for application
is *February 1, 2019*. Please contact Dr. Suzanne Estes
at estess@pdx.edu prior to this with informal enquiries.

EvolutionGutMicrobiomes
A funded PhD project is available in the Creevey group
at Queen's University Belfast, UK on the microbial ecol-
ogy of vertebrate gut microbiomes. Open to students
with biology/computer/bioinformatic backgrounds.
Project Title: What are the key ecological prin-
ciples underlying vertebrate gut microbiomes?
Apply here: https://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID 106 Deadline: Monday 5th
November 2018.
Project Description Gut microbiomes are complex
ecosystems that, when stable, promote disease resis-
tance and productivity in the host. While much of the
recent research in gut microbiomes has focused on the
changes that occur in gut microbial communities in re-sponse to uctuations in the environment or caused by
disease, little is known about the factors that promote
stability in healthy microbiomes.
This project will initially use the rumen microbiome to
investigate this phenomenon. Found in the rst stom-
ach chamber of ruminants such as cattle and sheep,
this highly complex microbial community is essential
to the survival of its host as it breaks down complex
carbohydrates into nutrients vital for the host's survival.
We will use computational approaches to investigate
how ecological and evolutionary principles developed
for understanding macro-communities can further our
understanding of stability in microbial communities in
the rumen. This will then be extended to other gut
ecosystems to investigate whether the same principles
apply across other vertebrates.
This is a computational project and is suitable both for
biologists keen to learn bioinformatics or computational
students keen to work with biological data. Successful
applicants will join the Ecological and Evolutionary Ge-
nomics group under the supervision of Professor Chris
Creevey (http://www.creeveylab.org).
Research aims: To understand the ecological princi-
ples underlying gut microbiome homeostasis we need to
know:
^A How responses of the gut microbiome to external
perturbations cause variable degrees of deviation from
homeostasis.
^A Which homeostatic responses may be competitively
advantageous for transient perturbations.
^A How functional (genes) and compositional (species)
factors drive retention and recuperation of homeostasis.
^A Whether the host exerts sucient inuence to pro-
mote homeostasis in the gut microbiome and which
factors in the microbiome are most associated.

StAndrews SocialEvolutionTheory
Natural selection explains the appearance of design in
the living world. But at what level is this design ex-
pected to manifest 'V gene, individual, society 'V and
what is its function? Social evolution provides a win-
dow on this problem, by pitting the interests of genes,
individuals and societies against each other.
I invite applications for a fully-funded 3.5 year PhD
studentship in my research group at the School of Bi-
ology, University of St Andrews, UK. I' ^Am looking for
a biology graduate who has a strong interest in social
evolution theory, or an economics / mathematics / phi-
losophy / physics graduate with a strong interest in
social behaviour.
Current research in my lab involves development of
general theory 'V using kin selection, multilevel selec-
tion, game theory and theoretical population genetics
approaches 'V and application of mathematical and
simulation models that are tailored to the biology of
real organisms, from microbes to insects to humans (see
http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/gardner/ for more de-
tails). To this end, I strongly encourage interactions
within the wider grouping of theoretical and empirical
biologists in St Andrews, as well as with collaborators
further aeld.
If social evolution really fascinates you, and you are
a careful thinker, then you will ourish in the type of
project that I enjoy supervising.

Graduate position/PhD position in Plant Systematics
at Stockholm University
Closing date: 5 November 2018.
We have an opening for a highly motivated graduate fel-
low to work on the research project \Genome evolution
in parasitic plants" in the group of Dr. Gitte Petersen
at Stockholm University.
The complete ad with information on how to ap-
ply is available on the Stockholm University web-
page: https://www.su.se/english/about/working-at-su/-
phd?cache=1%27 Project description: The Department
of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences invites
applications for a four-year PhD position part of the
project Genome evolution in parasitic plants. Plant
parasitism, where one plant obtains some or all of its
nutrients and water from a host plant, has evolved mul-
tiple times within angiosperms. One of the goals of
the current project is to compare organelle genomes
across the diversity of parasitic angiosperms to uncover
patterns potentially related to a parasitic lifestyle. Ex-
isting research has shown large changes in the chloro-
plast genomes of parasitic and mycoheterotrophic plants,
likely as a result of the decreased need for photosynthe-
sis in the parasite. An outstanding question surrounds
whether there are shared patterns of evolution in the
mitochondria of parasites. One clade of interest, the
Santalales, have shown substantial reductions in mito-
chondrial gene content (specically within mistletoe,
Viscum spp.), and the successful applicant would be
tasked with tracing the evolution of this and other mito-
chondrial patterns through the Santalales. The position
would involve de novo assembly of mitochondrial (and
potentially chloroplast) genomes, targeted sequencing
of mitochondrial genes, and comparative analyses in a
phylogenetic context.
Qualication requirements: In order to meet the general
entry requirements, the applicant must have completed
a second cycle degree, completed courses equivalent to
at least 240 higher education credits, of which 60 credits
must be in the second cycle, or have otherwise acquired
equivalent knowledge in Sweden or elsewhere.
In order to meet the specic entry requirements, the
general syllabus for doctoral studies in the eld of Plant
Systematics stipulates that applicants must have com-November 1, 2018 EvolDir 29

PlantSystematicsBiogeography
PhD and MS graduate positions in Plant Systematics
and Biogeography
Multiple PhD and MS graduate student positions are
available in the Spalink Lab at Texas A&M University
beginning in Fall 2019. Lab research concentrates on
the intersection of evolution, ecology, and geography
with an emphasis on modeling the roles of time, space,
and form in the diversication and maintenance of life.
The lab's ultimate goal is to merge our understanding ofthe evolutionary history of plant lineages with observed
patterns of biodiversity within and across landscapes.
In observing diversity around the world in the context
of global change, we ask: What is here? Why is it
here? Where is it going? Projects in the Spalink Lab
range from analyzing the dynamics of genetic diversity
within species to the evolution of entire orders, and
from regional patterns of community assembly to the
global structure of phylogenetic, functional, and mor-
phological diversity. Students with interests in a wide
variety of taxonomic groups and geographic localities
are welcomed to apply.
Students with interests or skills in any of the following
are encouraged to apply:
- Plant systematics - Biogeography - Community or
spatial ecology - Community assembly - Population ge-
netics - Species distribution modeling - Evolutionary
morphometrics - Spatial phylogenetics - Bioinformatics -
Conservation biology - Genomics and genome evolution
- Impacts of global change on species and communities
Graduate students in the Spalink Lab have full access
to the S.M. Tracy Herbarium, a vibrant and rapidly ex-
panding collection of over 350,000 specimens. Resources
for learning or improving bioinformatics skills abound at
Texas A&M University. We have multiple core genomics
facilities, high-throughput and high-performance com-
puter clusters, growth chambers, greenhouses, and eld
research sites throughout Texas. Students in the Spalink
Lab can opt for degrees in Ecosystem Science and Man-
agement (https://essm.tamu.edu), Dr. Spalink's home
department, or the cross-departmental EEB program
(https://eeb.tamu.edu), of which he is a core faculty
member.
Texas is a fantastic location for botanists. With over
5600 species, Texas is the second most diverse state in
the U.S. With a strong longitudinal precipitation and
elevation gradient, latitudinal temperature gradient, dy-
namic volcanic history, exposed bedrock dating back
a billion years, and an extensive coastline, Texas has
tremendous edaphic and climatic heterogeneity. This
results in everything from extremely arid deserts to wet
conifer forests, and from montane prairies to coastal
plains, all converging in Texas.
Interested applicants should contact Dr. Daniel Spalink
(dspalink@tamu.edu) and provide a description of your
research interests and a CV/resume. Initial screening of
students will begin immediately. For full consideration,
applications are due February 15. However, we
strongly recommend applying by December 15 to
ensure full consideration for departmental and college
fellowship opportunities. The Department of Ecosystem
Sciences and Management, EEB, and the College of32 EvolDir November 1, 2018

InsectInteractionNetworks
Temporal dynamics of insect assemblages and interac-
tions in oilseed rape crops
Background:
Among the potential solutions for a sustainable agricul-
ture, the concept of ecological intensication is particu-
larly promising. It hinges on the hypothesis that by act-
ing on populations and diversity of service providers, it is
possible to increase the multi-functionality of ecosystems.
To fully deploy an ecological intensication strategy and
ensure optimum delivery of ecosystem services, a better
understanding of the underpinning mechanisms shap-
ing not only biodiversity but also interaction networks
and their associated services is needed. In agroecosys-
tems, regulatory services such as animal pollination and
biological control of pests are particularly important
because they have the potential to maintain or increase
crop production while reducing chemical inputs. These
services are based not only on key species but also on
their trophic interactions.
The aim of this internship is to describe of the tem-
poral dynamics of species assemblages and interaction
networks involving key species of regulatory services in
oilseed rape (OSR) crops.
Tasks:
The research will involve monthly collection of sam-
ples in the eld (carabids, aphid mummies and possi-
bly pollen pellets from beehives) between March andNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 33
July, specimen identication and preparation those sam-
ples for next generation sequencing (illumina platform).
Fieldwork will be take place in Chize (Centre d'etude
Biologique de Chize). Laboratory work including insect
identication, dissection of carabids, DNA extraction,
DNA amplication and DNA purication, will take
place in Tours (Institute de Recherche sur la biologie de
l'Insecte). After preparation, the samples will be sent to
an external platform for high-throughput DNA sequenc-
ing. If the sequencing data are obtained before the end
of the internship, the student will have the opportunity
to perform basic bioinformatic analyses to reconstruct
trophic interactions networks.
Requirements:
- The student will be comfortable in the eld and in a
molecular laboratory
- Basic knowledge about insect taxonomy and utilisation
of identication keys
- Driving licence + personal vehicle
- Experience in DNA extraction and PCR would be
appreciated
Skills to be learned:
The student will learn about eld experimental design,
eld-collection of invertebrates and the dierent steps
required for the preparation of samples prior to high-
throughput DNA sequencing. Depending on the time
required to obtain sequencing data, the student may also
have the opportunity to learn some basic bioinformatic
skills.
Additional information
This internship is part of the ANR-funded project
IMAgHO (Increasing the Multifunctionality of Agroe-
cosystems by Harnessing fOod webs) and may be fol-

TrentU InvasiveSpeciesEvolution
Graduate student research into hybridization, inbreed-
ing, and invasive species
Surprisingly little is known about the extent to which in-
breeding depression impacts wild populations, although
we do know that stress typically increases the negative
eects of inbreeding. Rapidly changing environments,
including novel competition from alien invasive species,
provide potential stressors to plant species that regu-
larly inbreed and may have not previously experienced
ill eects from this inbreeding. Cattails (Typha spp.) in
eastern North America include native and introduced
species, but the most invasive taxon is the hybrid T.
x glauca. The parental species (T. latifolia and T. an-
gustifolia) have the potential to inbreed, but we don't
know how common inbreeding is, or whether it leads
to a reduction in tness. Hybrids, on the other hand,
have very high levels of genetic diversity and even when
inbred should be less likely to experience inbreeding
depression, at least in the F1 generation.
Using a combination of eld work, experimental gardens,
and genetic work, up to two grad students (MSc or PhD)
will investigate the eects of inbreeding and outbreeding
in natural populations of T. latifolia, T. angustifolia, and
T. x glauca and test a number of hypotheses that can
help to explain the dominance and invasion of southern
Ontario wetlands by hybrid cattails. There is the option
here to also include aspects of community and ecosys-
tem diversity and genetics. For more information see

environment. Working with insects, our approaches
commonly involve a combination of eld observation,
experimentation in controlled environments, and bioin-
formatics. Projects on speciation use hybridizing pop-
ulations to understand the genetic basis and evolution
of biological timing (seasonal and daily) and mating
behavior. Current work on climate adaptation focuses
on seasonal timing, its genetic repeatability, and its
inuence on tness and population persistence.
An undergraduate background in molecular genetics,
genomics, evolution, or ecology is preferred, as is prior
research experience. Highly relevant experience includes
application of molecular genetic techniques or analysis
of genome data. Students must also have the ability to
work with others and a sense of humor, both of which
are needed to make science fun and worthwhile.

UBern GrasslandBiodiversity
1 PhD position for conservation biologist/restoration
ecologist at the University of Bern, Switzerland.
Restoring grassland biodiversity: from degraded, species-
poor to integral stable-state ecosystems
There have been rapid changes in land-use in the past
decades in mountain agro-ecosystems, and they are still
ongoing. Where land is accessible to farming machinery,
grassland management has been massively intensied,
causing a dramatic collapse of biodiversity. This projet
will experimentally investigate - full-block design with
random allocation of treatment to eld - the resilience
of grassland to a relaxation of management intensity,
i.e. how they progressively return to biodiversity-richer
stable states. More specically, we shall compare the
biodiversity resilience of intensied grasslands situated
in landscapes dominated either by high-intensity grass-
lands or by low-intensity grasslands. In particular, we
expect the former to be much more dicult to restore
than the latter and will look for tipping points that may
guide future restoration projects.
The PhD candidate will collect baseline data (before in-
terventions) and monitor subsequent biotic and abiotic
environmental changes (following experimental manip-
ulation) using a series of biodiversity metrics such as
plant and invertebrate species richness, diversity indices,
functional traits, community composition, in parallel to
agricultural output metrics such as hay productivity and
quality. The reliance on a full block design will enable
avoiding the caveats and biases typically encountered
in mere observational studies, notably those caused by
unavoidable confounding environmental factors such as
landscape naturalness. The ultimate objective of this
research is to provide end-users, notably farmers and
authorities, with easily implementable, evidence-based
recommendations for future grassland restoration strate-
gies that maximize the return on investment of the
agricultural subsidies targeting biodiversity. The exper-
iment will start in 2019 and is foreseen to run 3-7 years,
with the PhD candidate engaged in its rst phase.
The candidate must hold a MSc degree, show a strong
interest in agro-ecology and master modern analytical
techniques and statistical software. Knowledge of grass-
land indicator taxa would be advantageous though not
prerequisite. English literacy is important, while knowl-
edge of German and French would represent a real asset,notably for dealing with farmers.
Start: January or February 2019; duration: 3 years.
Salary according to SNSF rules. Note that the PhD
student will be hosted in Sion during the eld season
(May to August) and that a driving licence is compul-
sory. Email your letter of motivation with CV, list of
publications, summary of MSc thesis, as well as two ref-

UCalgary ExptlMicrobialEvolution
Jeremy Fox and Peter Duneld have a joint opening
for an MSc student starting in Sept. 2019 to work on
experimental evolution of facultative methanotrophy
in microbes. Most bacterial species are either obligate
methanotrophs, or cannot use methane as a C source
at all, suggest a strong evolutionary trade-o between
methanotrophy and use of other C sources. The exis-
tence of facultative methanotrophs thus represents an
evolutionary puzzle.
The Fox lab pursues fundamental research in ecology
and evolution, using microbial microcosms as model
systems.| The Duneld lab has discovered several new
methanotrophic species and developed culture protocols
for methanotrophs, and whole genome sequences are now
available. This provides the foundation for long-term
experimental evolution of methanotrophs in controlled
environments with dierent C sources, to test for the
hypothesized trade-o and identify conditions under
which facultative methanotrophy would be favored by
selection.
Guaranteed nancial support (minimum $23,00038 EvolDir November 1, 2018
CAD/year) is available, in addition to nancial sup-
port for research, conference travel, etc.

an interest in evolutionary questions. All interested
candidates will be considered.

PhD position in Avian Evolutionary and Conservation
Genomics
Inquiry deadline: November 30, 2018
Application deadline: January 15, 2019
The Homan and Savage labs invite applications for a
joint PhD position working on a funded project focused
on genomics and conservation of endangered Florida
scrub jays.
Starting date: August 2019
Duration: 4-6 years
Compensation: Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA)
stipend during Fall and Spring semesters; Graduate Re-
search Assistantship (GRA) stipend for at least the rst
two summers.
Project Overview:
Construction and other causes of habitat loss have led
to destruction and fragmentation of suitable habitat for
Aphelocoma coerulescens, the Florida scrub-jay (FSJ).
In the past, translocation has been used as a manage-
ment strategy for mitigating negative impacts to many
wildlife populations, including FSJ populations. How-
ever, translocation may not be the ideal solution given
that translocation itself can have negative impacts, par-
ticularly for FSJs which exhibit complex social behavior
that may cause diculty in surviving and reproducing
at the site of translocation. An alternative approach
could be to passively manage FSJs following habitat
loss, assess whether they relocate on their own, and if
so, determine whether their survival and reproduction is
based on genomic compatibility with resident birds. We
are conducting a systematic analysis of the benets of
these two strategies - passive management versus active
translocation - by conducting four years of monitoring
and banding FSJs and collecting a variety of samplesfor genetic, genomic, immunity, and health assessments.
Ultimately, we will incorporate functional and popula-
tion genomics, measures of immunity and disease, and
survival/recruitment parameters to integrate structured
decision making (SDM) to assess the long-term feasi-
bility of passive compared to active translocation when
FSJs suer habitat loss.
Dissertation topics and required skills:
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to fo-
cus on whole genome resequencing and bioinformatics
of FSJs, including birds impacted by habitat loss and
birds that do not face direct habitat threats. A Master's
degree is not required. However, we will give priority
to candidates with extensive bioinformatics experience
working with whole genome or genome-scale datasets in
non-model organisms. The student will have access to
and be a member of UCF's interdisciplinary Genomics
and Bioinformatics Cluster, including computational
and benchtop resources (Savage and Homan both hold
cluster appointments). Dissertation focus will be exi-
ble, at the discretion of the student, within the broader
context of conservation genomics, population genomics,
and evolutionary genomics using FSJs as the focal taxon.
Inquiries should be directed to Anna Sav-
age (anna.savage@ucf.edu) and Eric Homan

departmental strengths in behavioral, spatial, and mi-
crobial ecology, evolutionary and comparative genomics,
and developmental biology. The following labs are ac-
tively recruiting in evolutionary and ecological disci-
plines, though opportunities may be available across the
department.
Brian Buma - The Buma lab is interested in ecosystem
change from local to global scales. We study how dis-
turbances and climate change (think wildre, wind, and
snow loss) impacts ecosystem resilience, composition,
functioning, and distributions. Current work runs
from the boreal forest of northern Alaska through the
high mountains of Colorado to southern Chile, and
focuses on carbon cycling, species distributions, and
conservation questions. Methods include both eld and
lab work, and then scaling those ndings to broader
scales via statistical modeling and remote sensing/GIS.
Website: www.brianbuma.com . Mike Greene - My
research group studies the mechanisms behind the
collective-organization of ant societies. The ant colony
is a distributed system and thus we are interested in the
mechanisms by which individual ants make behavioral
decisions, such as to ght an opponent, and how the
many decisions by worker ants lead to the emergence of
changes in colony behavior, such distributing foragersto a preferred food source. We study brain mechanisms
including the roles of monoamine neurotransmitters
in aecting decisions, the roles of chemical cues used
to communicate information, and the patterns by
which workers behavior. Our main system is the
collective-organization of pavement ant (Tetramor-
ium caespitum) wars between neighboring colonies.

and computational approaches to study microbial
communities, with an emphasis on the microbial
ecology of methane-emitting freshwater wetlands and
the genomic diversity and evolution of archaea. For

Greg Ragland - We study the genetic mechanisms
controlling complex trait adaptation and speciation,
evolution of climatic adaptation, and mechanisms

UEdinburgh
HostParasiteInteractions
PhD available at the University of Edinburgh,
UK: The evolutionary ecology of disease transmis-
sion: how are vector control programmes chang-
ing parasite life histories? In the lab of Sarah
Reece. http://www.reecelab.science Application in-
structions are here: https://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID1553 Project Description Par-
asites live in inside the bodies of others, with whom they
are engaged in a life-and-death struggle. The Reece lab
uncovers the strategies parasites have evolved to cope
with the challenges and opportunities of their lifestyle by
asking 'what makes a successful parasite and what are
the evolutionary limits to their success?'. Specically,
we investigate how parasites maximise \survival" and
\reproduction". These tness components underpin the
symptoms and transmission of diseases.
Most disease research focuses on interactions between
parasites and their hosts. Analogous studies of interac-
tions between parasites and vectors have been largely
neglected, despite the fact that vectors are responsible
for spreading disease. Clearly, to fully understand the
evolution of vector-born parasites it is necessary to ask
how they solve the challenges of living in hosts and in vec-
tors. This is especially important for malaria parasites
whose vectors are changing in response to vector-control
programs (e.g., bed nets, insecticides). Whilst the evo-
lutionary responses of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes
to vector-control are being monitored, the knock-on con-
sequences for parasite evolution have been overlooked.
Just like drugs or vaccines administered to hosts, vector-
control represents an ecological perturbation aimed at
reducing parasite tness. History clearly illustrates that
attempts to reduce the survival and/or transmission of
malaria parasites is usually met with counter-evolution(e.g., drug resistance mutations and phenotypic toler-
ance). Parasite counter evolution to vector-control may
be constrained or facilitated, depending on the amount
of genetic variation and plasticity underpinning parasite
phenotypes. Anticipating parasite evolution will inform
monitoring strategies for current control programs as
well as uncovering novel new vector-control strategies.
Malaria is transmitted by Anopheline mosquitoes and
their control centres on long-lasting insecticide treated
bed nets and indoor residual spraying. Insecticides are
implicated in causing: the evolution of resistance mu-
tations to target sites and detoxication mechanisms,
shifts in feeding schedule and location, altered host
preference, changes in the relative importance of dier-
ent mosquito species as vectors, and shorter lifespan.
Predicting how parasites will respond to such changes
in vector populations requires knowledge of: (a) The
impacts of interventions on parasites directly (e.g. do
insecticides kill parasites?). (b) How parasite tness is
aected by changes in vector genotypes and phenotypes
(e.g. insecticide resistance, biting time-of-day, lifespan,
vector species). (c) How much plasticity and genetic vari-
ation exist in parasite populations for heritable traits,
including tness, that are aected by vector-control.
(d) Whether parasite traits aected by vector-control
are governed by trade-os or co-variances that aect
responses to selection.
This PhD will open the black box of what life inside
mosquito vectors is like and develop a novel eld by re-
vealing the genetic and environmental drivers of parasite
transmission to, and from, the vector. This project will
use malaria parasites of rodents and mosquitoes to inte-
grate developments from dierent biological disciplines
into an evolutionary framework. Malaria parasites are
an ideal model system because well-controlled laboratory
experiments that perturb the environments parasites
experience within mosquito vectors can easily be car-
ried out. The experiments will reveal the genetic and
environmental drivers of parasite transmission to, and
from, the vector.
The PhD student will be joining a well-resourced lab
with a technician, graduate research assistant and lab
manager, 3 other PhD students, and 3 postdocs. Thus,
the student will receive considerable intellectual and
practical support to develop their research project. Our
work to date suggests there are multiple novel and
tractable directions for this PhD project to take and
the student will be encouraged to decide which lines
of enquiry to follow and to develop their own interests
during the PhD.

UEdinburgh PopulationGenomics
PhD studentship in population genomics at Roslin In-
stitute (University of Edinburgh, UK)
Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the most
important farmed food sh in the developing world.
Selective breeding of tilapia is a key component of sus-
tainable production, contributing to improvements in
sh growth and resilience. However, the consequences of
selective breeding on the genetic makeup of the farmed
tilapia strains is unknown. This project aims to use
modern genomics tools to identify \signatures" (specic
regions of the genome) associated with both selective
breeding and adaptation to particular farmed environ-
ments. Knowledge of these key genomic regions will help
inform future tilapia breeding and ultimately contribute
to increased tilapia production.
To achieve this aim, whole-genome sequences of farmed
tilapia from several tropical countries will be used to
identify selection signatures. Comparisons of these
signatures between populations will allow separation
of the consequences of selection for fast growth from
those associated with sh adapting to particular environ-
ments. Identication of environment-specic genomic
signatures, and subsequently genes and functions asso-
ciated with these, will reveal functional changes specic
to adaptation to the particular environments in which
these sh are kept. These genomic regions and func-
tional elements can be utilised for genetic improvement
to optimise tilapia production. This project involves a
collaboration between the Roslin Institute (University of
Edinburgh), the University of Aberdeen and WorldFish,
an international, non-prot research organization that
works to reduce hunger and poverty across the world by
improving sheries and aquaculture. The project will
provide an exciting opportunity for a keen student toreceive training in cutting-edge genetics and genomics
techniques at a world-class research institute while also
contributing to improvement of food security in the
developing world.
Training: The studentship will provide extensive train-
ing in transferable skills and techniques in quantitative
and population genetics, statistics, bioinformatics and
genomic analysis, including analysis of whole genome
sequence data. The University of Edinburgh oers a
number of valuable taught courses that may benet
the student. The student will also attend a variety of
seminars, journal clubs and local meetings and there
will be opportunities for attendance at national and
international conferences.
Eligibility: All candidates should have or expect to
have a minimum of an appropriate upper 2nd class
degree in a related eld and possess strong computa-
tional/quantitative skills. To qualify for full funding,
students must be UK or EU citizens who have been
resident in the UK for 3 years prior to commencement.

Lake Constance, one of the best- studied lakes in the

eutrophication, climate change, neobiota) within the last
century. Eutrophication, the stressor of main concern

but its immediate and long-term consequences for the
ecosystem, as well as the mechanisms inducing changes,
are not well understood. Within the Research Train-

1) Spatiotemporal patterns of resilience and reversibility
in relation to functional, taxonomic and phylogenetic
diversity in plankton populations This study will investi-
gate changes in functional, taxonomic and phylogenetic
diversity in relation to trophic changes through time and
at dierent sites, using environmental DNA extracted
from sediment cores spanning the last century. DNA will
be extracted from sediment cores, amplied with specic
assays and amplicons sequenced using high-throughput
technology. By targeting highly variable markers, dier-
ent species or genotypes of key plankton species can be
tracked and their response to abiotic changes, as well
as community turnovers, can be analyzed. For more
information on this project contact Prof. Dr. Laura
Epp, Junior Professor for Environmental Genomics in
Aquatic Systems
2) Relative role of viruses for phytoplankton control
This project will test the relative role of aquatic virusesand zooplankton for controlling phytoplankton changes
under dierent nutrient regimes and whether and how
evolutionary changes modify coexistence and responses
to shifts in the nutrient level. Using microcosm ex-
periments in combination with modelling, we aim to
study the importance of rapid evolutionary changes and
eco-evolutionary dynamics for the resilience of consumer-
resource systems to eutrophication as well as the con-
sequences for the reversibility of the system during re-
oligotrophication. For more information on this project

ULiverpool HostParasiteInteractions
Project Description
The bumblebee Bombus terrestris has become a key
ecological and evolutionary model of host parasite inter-
actions. This bumblebee is commonly infected with a
Trypanosomatid gut parasite, Crithidia bombi, which
has dramatic eects on host tness. Among the features
of this interaction is a dramatic degree of specicity.
That is, that some bumblebee genotypes are infected50 EvolDir November 1, 2018
with certain parasite genotypes, but not others. This
specicity is the result of both host, parasite, and bac-
terial microbiota characteristics that are as yet poorly
understood.
With the recent sequencing of both the host and parasite
genomes, and the advent of genome editing technologies
that can be applied in the host, parasite, and microbiota,
we are now in a position to tease apart the mechanisms
that determine infection in a key ecological and evolu-
tionary model system.
This project will target candidate genes in the para-
site and the host and use CRISPR/Cas9 editing and
RNA interference to assess their functional importance
to disease outcome. The results of this work will have
direct implications for key global issues, including pro-
tecting pollinators, which is crucial for food security,
and insect-trypanosome interactions, many of which
cause devastating human and livestock diseases.
The ideal student for this project would be one who
wishes to apply their molecular biology skills to a novel
model system to understand host-parasite interaction.
This project will suit a student with interests in evolu-
tionary ecology, microbiology, parasitology, genetics, or
molecular biology. Existing skills in any of those areas
would be helpful but independence, curiosity, a healthy
sense of humor, and a certain amount of grit are usually
more important.
The successful student will develop skills in evolutionary
ecology, host-parasite interaction, immunology, molec-
ular biology, genome editing, and genomics. These
skills will be highly marketable both in industry and
in academia. The Institute of Integrative Biology at
the University of Liverpool and the Liverpool School
of Tropical Medicine oer a vibrant and world-leading
community of researchers to interact with, providing
many opportunities for collaboration.
This project is looking for a student with good up-
per second or rst class degree in biological or life sci-
ences, biomedical, evolutionary biology, microbiology,
molecular biology, parasitology, or other relevant elds.
If interested please contact me by email if you have

focus areas: 1) Genetic underpinnings of nesting adap-
tations and links between nesting traits, including the
timing of nest initiation, candidate genes for circadian
rhythms, and reproductive tness across sparrow species;
2) Parallel evolution - this student will investigate broad-
scale genotype-phenotype and genotype-environment re-
lationships in relation to tidal marsh adaptations for six
sparrow species sampled across an environmental and
geographic gradient; and 3) Diet and eco-evolutionary
feedbacks - this student will study variation in sparrow
diets using meta-barcoding of fecal samples and the link-
ages with tness and the trophic impacts on the marsh;
this student will also work closely with Drs. Serita Frey
(UNH) and Mike Kinnison (UMaine). To apply, or for
more information, contact adrienne.kovach@unh.edu.

UWuerzburg ClimateAdaptation
Modeling adjustment to new climate conditions in a
landscape context: identication of risk zones and man-
agement options
In a joint and highly integrated study design the Land-
Klif Network investigates the biodiversity and multi-
functionality of semi-natural, agricultural and urban
landscape areas in dierent climate zones of Bavaria, in
order to answer these questions and to develop options
for the mitigation of climate change as well as the adap-
tation to changing climatic conditions. See homepage
https://www.bayklif.de/verbundprojekte/landklif/ for
more details on overall aims and particular sub-projects.
Here we are seeking a PhD candidate for TP6.
The task for the PhD candidate will be developing and
analyzing of spatially explicit| simulations of communi-
ties' responses to changes in climate (mean and variabil-ity). The focus of analysis will be on understanding the
importance of the landscape context for the ability of lo-
cal communities to adapt to changing climatic regimes,
maintain ecosystem services, and on dening strate-
gies that may help to mitigate negative eects of such
changes. Project aims for providing general (theoretical)
results and - in cooperation with project partners -|
principles as well as recommendations with regard to
particular empirical systems. We are seeking highly
motivated PhD candidates with strong interest and ex-
pertise in developing suitable spatially explicit models
and a tting MSc degree (landscape ecology, evolution).
Scientic writing and communication skills in English
are required. The candidates are expected to work both
individually and in team and to be able to integrate
into an interdisciplinary, ambitious project. Candidate
should have a background in modeling, e.g. in R, Pascal,
Julia. Competence in working with GIS based maps

PlantEvolutionaryGenetics
Funded PhD Opportunity \Evolution of the S-locus
supergene in Primula and related Taxa" - \ESPriT
Project" This project is funded by: University of Zurich
(Switzerland), Fondazione Edmund Mach (Italy)
Subject: Evolutionary genetics
Summary Heterostyly is a genetic polymorphism in
which plant populations consist of two (distyly) oral
morphs that dier reciprocally in the heights of stigmas
and anthers. In the plant genus Primula (primrose), dis-
tyly is inherited as a simple Mendelian trait controlled
by ve genes organized in a single linkage group, termed
heterostyly supergene. While the causal involvement of
two of the genes, GLO2 and CYP734A50, in the onset of
heterostyly has been recently established, the functions
of the other three genes in the heterostyly supergene
have been inferred only through sequence homology and
await experimental conrmation. The project has four
major objectives: 1. The functional characterization
of the genes at the heterostyly locus in primroses 2.
The comparative determination of the relative evolu-
tionary pressures acting on each of them and on the
locus as a whole 3. The dissection of natural genetic
variation underlying heterostyly loss 4. The elucidation
of how hybridization aects the evolutionary fate of the
heterostyly locus
This project, pending nal approval by both partner
institutions, will require the candidate to spend
half of the time at Zurich University (Elena Conti's
lab: https://www.systbot.uzh.ch/de/Personen/-
ProfessorenundDozenten/ElenaConti.html) and half
at FEM laboratories (Claudio Varotto's lab: https:/-
/www.fmach.it/eng/CRI/general-info/organisation/-
Chief-scientic-oce/Biodiversity-molecular-ecology/-
Ecogenomics). It will provide state-of-the-art training
in functional and evolutionary approaches at both
the inter- and intra-specic levels. This project will
constitute a unique opportunity to identify the molecu-
lar bases of one of the most relevant polymorphisms
responsible for both reproductive and evolutionary
mechanisms in wild plants.
The selected student will be included in a Ph.D. program
through the University of Zurich and will comply with
the coursework, teaching, and research requirements ofthat University.

BioinformaticsSoftwareDevelopment
Hi EvolDir,
We are developing a platform to integrate data on ge-
netic and agricultural diversity into CONABIO's biodi-
versity information system. This type of data is normally
published as les with arbitrary formats that are dicult
to relate to each other and that become obsolete with
the passage of time. This restricts the usefulness of data
to generate knowledge beyond the immediate project for
which they were generated. There are public databases
specialized in this type of data (e.g., NCBI, EBI, TAIR),
but they do not store all the information of interest
for CONABIO and are separated from other useful in-
formation (e.g. geolocation, environmental variables,
phenotypic measurements).
The goal of CONABIO is to provide a standardized
and modular platform that allows to store, manage and
retrieve data easily and quickly. For this, data models
that can cover complex data belonging to the same con-
cept will be dened and repeated within the projects.
The platform is being implemented using GraphQL
accessible via HTTP and a graphical interface. The
programming language is NodeJS.
We have software developer open position to join a
Mexican-German team working in the project mentioned
above. The job is based at Mexico City, but there is
exibility for remote working. Understanding of written
Spanish is required. The call for applications is directed

use data and samples collected by the long-term study
of Soay sheep on the remote St Kilda archipelago: we
will be regularly collecting faecal samples from known
individual sheep, DNA will be extracted from these sam-
ples and meta-barcoding approaches applied to quantify
the community structure of bacteria, nematodes and
protozoans present in the gut.
This job will involve setting up and managing the ex-
traction and PCR of samples collected on St Kilda for
sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. You will
be part of a large, dynamic research team, involving
12 investigators from 6 dierent institutions and up to
8 project sta. You will represent a pivotal part of
this team, responsible for ensuring that high quality se-

ESEB HewittMobilityAward
DeadlineJan14
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2018 'V Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility grants for
young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Monday 14 January 2019, 12.00 GMT.
*Eligibility: *
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. In addition, applicants will be consid-
ered who are more than 6 years from the start of their
PhD if they have had career breaks, worked part-time,
or for other reasons have not worked continuously. The
maximum single award will be 2000 Euros. It must be
used to support eldwork or a period of research at a
lab that you have not previously visited. There is no
restriction on the country of residence or nationality of
the applicant. A report will be required by 30 April
2020, by which time the funds must have been used.
*Application procedure: *
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Moniatte at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from your
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded from
your home institution or your proposed host institution.Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Roger Butlin. The aim will be to announce deci-
sions before the end of March 2019. In previous rounds,
success rates have been between 20 and 40%.
The committee will consider the following key criteria:
1.The value of the proposed mobility in terms of its
expected output and impact on the applicant' ^As career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant' ^As existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant' ^As own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant' ^As career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.

learnPopGen Rpackage
Dear colleagues.
I'm very pleased to announce the ocial release of a
new R package called learnPopGen that has been de-
signed primarily for the purposes of teaching evolu-
tionary biology, population genetics, and evolutionary
theory. Functions of the package can be used to conduct
simulations and numerical analyses of a wide range of
evolutionary phenomena that would typically be cov-
ered in advanced undergraduate through graduate-levelcurricula in population genetics or evolution. For in-
stance, learnPopGen functions can be used to visualize
gene frequency changes through time under multiple
deterministic and stochastic processes, to compute and
animate the changes in phenotypic trait values or distri-
butions under natural selection, to numerically analyze
and graph the outcome of simple game theory models,
and to plot coalescence within a population experiencing
genetic drift, along with a number of other things. As
much as possible, I have attempted to design functions
of the package to be maximally didactic, for instance
by using animated visualizations. For instructor use
within lecture materials, it is also straightforward to
export plots and animations from R in the form of at
or animated graphics, or as videos.
Instructors interested in using functions of learnPopGen
for teaching have two options. For maximum exibility,
students working with the package can be guided to run
functions directly in R. However, under many circum-
stances (for instance, if learning to run the package in R
would be a distraction in realizing the pedagogical ob-
jectives of the segment) instructors may instead choose
to guide students to one of various web interfaces that I
have built for a number of the functions of the package
using the shiny web application framework. These web
interfaces are already available for public use online.
learnPopGen can be installed locally from CRAN
(https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=learnPopGen)
or from its webpage (https://github.com/liamrevell/-
learnPopGen) and run from any computer than has
R.
All currently built web interfaces are available on
the learnPopGen web interfaces page: http://-
www.phytools.org/PopGen/ . I encourage package &
learnPopGen web interface users to register their use
of the package and to provide positive feedback & con-
structive criticism on the learnPopGen feedback page:
http://www.phytools.org/PopGen/feedback.html. Con-
structive criticism will help me improve the learnPopGen
package & these apps. Perhaps more importantly, pos-
itive feedback will help me to justify their continued
development & maintenance.
Thanks!

LightPollution Survey
Anthropogenic night light and noise pollution are glob-
ally pervasive forms of environmental pollution. They
are increasingly changing ecosystems with important
implications for biodiversity. Please help us understand
how these sensory stimuli aect wildlife by participating
in this survey.
This survey is a crucial part of a NASA-funded project
led by Boise State University, and your input will help
us inform conservation decision-making by understand-
ing how select biological traits aect vertebrate species'
vulnerability to anthropogenic night light and noise. All
responses are anonymous.
Potential participants include those with backgrounds
in animal behavior, animal physiology, wildlife ecol-
ogy, or sensory ecology or those with ~3 or more
years of study/experience with a particular vertebrate
species/genus/taxon. As examples, a PhD candidate
studying sea turtle nesting success, a biologist working
in Everglades National Park for ten years, or an assis-
tant professor of wildlife ecology would all potentially
be suitable for this survey. We are looking for a diverse
range of participants from academia, non-governmental
agencies, nonprots, and etc. studying or working with
vertebrates from across the globe to complete this sur-
vey.
We estimate the survey will take between 10-15 min-
utes to complete. To participate, please follow this

Madagascar Sample Exportation
Hi all,
We would greatly appreciate if someone had suggestions
for exportation of lemur samples (fecal, blood, tissue,and serum) from Madagascar to the US. Fecal samples
stored in RNAlater, blood samples in a room tempera-
ture blood preservative solution (0.1M Tris base, 0.1 M
Sodium EDTA, and 2% SDS), and tissue samples in a
room temperature tissue preservative solution (250 mM
Sodium EDTA pH 7.5, 20% DMSO, 0.2% glutaralde-
hyde, and saturated sodium chloride).
Previously our sta has been able to hand carry samples,
but due to CDC permit restrictions, it sounds like we
must send them by air. DHL and Fedex have said they
cannot help, so we are trying to use a US based logistics
company to help but they have not been able to get us a
quote in over a month due to limitations from Malagasy
logistics agents and from the airlines. We have all the
necessary permits on both sides.
If someone has been able to air export samples from
Madagascar previously, we would love any input or sug-
gestions!
Many thanks!

Seeking volunteer research assistants for 3 month cohort
in Kianjavato, Madagascar
Aliated with the Omaha' ^As Henry Doorly Zoo and
Aquarium's Conservation Genetics Department
About us: The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership is
a Malagasy NGO founded and piloted by Dr. Edward
Louis Jr., Director of the Conservation Genetics Depart-
ment at OHDZA in Omaha, Nebraska. Together they
work to protect and restore Madagascar's remaining
forests and diverse wildlife.
Project Overview: During a 12-week tenure, volunteer
cohorts will spend half their time monitoring lemurs and
half their time participating in the community-based
reforestation eort.
Lemur Monitoring (5 weeks): Volunteers will follow
social groups of either the greater bamboo lemur (Pro-114 EvolDir November 1, 2018
lemur simus) or the black-and-white rued lemur (Vare-
cia variegata) within the mountainous terrain of the
Kianjavato-Vatovavy landscape. The longterm goal of
this project is to oer protection for these two Criti-
cally Endangered species while gathering information
on habitat usage, population dynamics, and territorial
range.
Reforestation Project (5 weeks): This grassroots refor-
estation eort reconnects and expands natural habi-
tats over the mountainous terrain around Kianjavato
while sustainably beneting the 14,000 area residents.
Through this project we have planted over 1.8 million
trees in Madagascar. The overall goal of this project is
to restore habitats for wildlife and alternative resources
for the local community.
Qualications/Experience: We want volunteers who are
going to be 100% dedicated to the projects and go above
and beyond to contribute to the NGO. We prefer vol-
unteers with at least a BA or BS in the biological or
environmental sciences, and tropical restoration or for-
est management experience is a plus. Some independent
research experience will be an advantage, as will work
or travel experience in tropical countries. A willingness
to work in isolated conditions, the ability to solve prob-
lems independently, and dedication to a positive and
respectful working environment is vital.
2019 Volunteer Cohort Schedule:
* January Cohort (January 15 'V 17 arrival in Madagas-
car; April 9 'V 11 departure from Madagascar) * March
Cohort (March 19 'V 21 arrival in Madagascar; June
11 'V 13 departure from Madagascar) * May Cohort
(May 21 'V 23 arrival in Madagascar; August 13 'V 15
departure from Madagascar) * July Cohort (July 23 'V
July 25 arrival in Madagascar; October 15 'V 17 depar-
ture from Madagascar) * September Cohort (Sept 24-26
arrival in Madagascar; December 17 'V 19 departure
from Madagascar)
2019 costs for participating in the MBP Volunteer pro-
gram:
* $250 USD non-refundable deposit (to secure your place-
ment with the program) * $750 USD accommodation
fees (includes airport assistance, travel costs to/from
eld station, tent site rental, and food) * 55USD/50Euro
90 day tourist Visa (payable at the airport upon your
arrival)

Paris AppleDomestication
Internship
Title: Reconstructing apple tree domestication using
coalescent-based based approaches combined with Ap-
proximate Bayesian computation
*Summary*
The role of gene ow during adaptation still remains
little understood. Domestication is a relevant model
for investigating such question because of the weak re-
productive barriers that imply recurrent crop-wild gene
ow. Our recent results showed an initial domestica-
tion of the cultivated apple from the Central Asian wild
apple (*Malus sieversii*) followed by a substantial con-
tribution of the European wild apple (*M. sylvestris*)
to the cultivated apple genome (Cornille et al. 2012 Plos
Genetics) by recent wild-to-crop introgressions. Yet, the
contribution of other wild apple species (Caucasian and
Central Asian) present along the Silk Roads has been
suggested (Cornille et al. 2014 Trends in Genetics). The
student will use a unique collection of 3,000 wild and
cultivated apple samples genotyped for 26 microsatellite
markers to quantify the contribution of additional wild
species present along the Silk Routes and the extent of
wild-to-crop gene ow in the apple system. This unique
collection of samples including additional wild species
and local cultivars along the Silk Routes compared to
our previous work (Cornille et al. 2012 PloS Genetics),
that will make it possible to reconstruct the full domes-
tication history of the apple and will bring new insights
into domestication of perennials (Cornille et al. 2014
Trends in Genetics).
The Master 2 student will have the opportunity to pur-
sue a PhD project starting in fall 2019 on the adaptive
genomics of apple domestication, using whole genomes.
This ambitious project will yield unprecedented insights
into the genomic process of adaptation, introducing to
the international research community the apple tree as
a unique model, with a recent history of gene ow and
selection triggered by humans, with fundamental and
applied consequences of the ndings.
*Duration* : 6 months, january/feb 2019 ' june/july2019 , starting dates are exible, contact Amandine
CORNILLE for further discussions. Monthly gratica-
tion: 500 euros/month.
Methodology: population genetic analyses (genetic di-
versity, population structure and demographic inferences
using approximate Bayesian Computation).
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-
date will have skills in genetics/genomics and evolution
and at least will show strong interest in these elds.
He/she will not necessarily be familiar with apple mod-
els. The Master project will be proposed to the Doc-
toral School \Science du V eg etal" (Paris-Sud Doctoral
School) for a PhD project on the genomic basis of apple
adaptation during domestication in june 2019.

The role of model t in resolving the Tree of Life Jeremy
Brown (LSU) Wednesday, October 24, 2018, 9:00 PM
PDT
More data alone will not resolve the Tree of Life. That
statement encapsulates perhaps the most striking les-
son of phylogenomics. While genome sequences provide
us with an invaluably rich source of information about
evolutionary history, our ability to properly interpret
this information is sometimes awed, which has led to
protracted debates about some of the most interesting
and enigmatic relationships across the Tree. However,
phylogenetic inference now has a robust grounding in
statistical inference. This grounding gives us tools to
at least recognize the existence, and hopefully resolve
the source, of errors when they occur. These tools are
important and broadly applied in other areas of sta-
tistical inference, but have been slow to be adopted in
phylogenetics. In this talk, I will cover some of the
strategies that have been proposed for assessing model
t, some of the reasons for the slow adoption, and the
challenges that remain. Andy Magee UW Biology

Sycamore maple RequestForSamples
Hello,
We need samples (leaf or seed) of sycamore maple (/Acer
pseudoplatanus/). The sampling protocol is described
below.
*Leaf sampling design of sycamore maple (Acer pseu-
doplatanus L.), at spring* Leaf samplings are carried
out in natural populations of sycamore maple (i.e. in
naturally regenerated stands, i.e. a public forest ' no
park, no private garden).
For each sample considered as a population ex-nihilo (i.e.
forest), 2 fresh leaves ( ~20 cm2 leaf blade) are collected
on 20 adult trees according to the wood patch area (pair-
wise distance between individuals ~30 m) and stored in
a paper bag (or in between journal paper sheet). We
recommend using separate paper envelopes to store the
2 leaves of a given individual tree. Label each enve-
lope/sample with: - | | |the 2-digits country code
(https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/ctycodes.htm) - |
| |the rst 3 letters of the sampled forest or the closest
town/city near the sampled patch (i.e. the population)
- | | |2 digits corresponding to the iterative number
of the individual sampled ' if each individual is located
by GPS (e.g. FR ' HIR ' 01 = rst individual collected
in Hirson forest, France). /Optional/: when possible,
locate the sampled trees with a GPS, coordinates areNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 117
to be sent with the samples. The 20 (optimally) enve-
lope/samples collected in one forest patch or population
are pooled in one larger envelope labeled with: - | |
|the name of the sampler and/or his/her e-mail (e.g.
thomas.kichey@u-picardie.fr) - | | |the sampling
state (e.g. France ' FR) - | | |the population id
(e.g. Hirson - HIR) - | | |GPS population location
(e.g 49 ^Ao57'4.54\N; 4 ^Ao8'9.28"E - could be extracted
from GoogleEarth)
* **Seed sampling design of sycamore maple (Acer pseu-
doplatanus L.), at Fall* Seed samplings are carried out
in natural populations of sycamore maple (i.e. in natu-
rally regenerated stands, i.e. a public forest ' no park, no
private garden). For each population, about 100 mature
seeds are collected on the ground below an adult tree (or
in the branch of the adult tree) located in the middle of
the stand and stored (dry) in an envelope or paper bags
(one bag per stand). Optional: when possible, locate
the sampled tree with a GPS. The samples collected in
one tree are labeled with: - | | |the name of the
sampler and/or his/her e-mail (e.g. thomas.kichey@u-
picardie.fr) - | | |the sampling state (e.g. France '

Postdoc in Discipline-Based Education Research, De-
partment of Biological Sciences, Ballen Lab
A postdoctoral position is available in the lab of Cissy
Ballen at Auburn University to study biology education.
Our focus is STEM equity, and we conduct investiga-
tions of the causes and consequences of gaps in science
literacy, and how educators can design their courses to
minimize barriers to success. By developing an inte-
grated experimental and theoretical research program
we explore how classroom and social inuences shape
student learning, personal and professional development,
and educational and career trajectories.
Here is our website: https://balle027.wixsite.com/-cjballen Here are some examples of broad questions we
are addressing in the lab: What geographic, cultural,
or institutional barriers predict patterns of attrition
among historically underserved students in STEM at
the undergraduate level? What types of scalable teach-
ing strategies can instructors employ to reduce gaps
in performance and participation? How do research
experiences impact developing scientists' personal and
professional development and career trajectories? How
can we use measures of physiological reactivity to study
engagement in an undergraduate STEM classroom set-
ting?
Auburn is a fantastic, aordable college town, and DBS
is a vibrant and collaborative setting for discipline-based
education research. We have great resources here to
study education, oering a wide range of opportunities
for expanding your skill set.
Postdoc applicants should have a PhD in any area of
biology, biology education, statistics, or other related
eld. To apply, please send me (mjb0100(at)auburn.edu)
a cover letter detailing your interest in biology educa-
tion research, CV, and the names of three references.
The position is for 1 year with the option to extend for
another year. Although funding from the lab itself is
available, I will be particularly interested in applicants
interested in seeking external funding. I will continue
to accept applications until the position is lled.

The Plant Repro Evo lab (http://-
plantreproevo.natur.cuni.cz) is searching for a
motivated postdoc researcher to study the speciation
dynamics and the evolution of hybridization barriers
across the Arabidopsis genus. The project will aim
at understanding how pre- and postzygotic barriers
and their interplay shape within and between species
divergence. In particular, part of the project will
elucidate the genetic basis of specic barriers and the
evolution of underlying loci will be surveyed across
the Arabidopsis genus. Finally, how sexual selection
inuences the emergence of hybridization barriers will
be tested, working in collaboration with a PhD student
focused on sexual selection in plants.
The project will use developmental biology, genetics
and population genomics approaches. The successful
candidate will thus have experience with at least plant
reproduction biology, plant evolution, population genet-
ics or bioinformatics, or ideally several of them.
The Plant Repro Evo lab is hosted by the De-
partment of Botany of Charles University (https://-

Schiedea (carnation family, Caryophyllaceae): rapid
radiation of an endemic plant genus in the Hawaiian
Islands'. This project integrates eld work, genome
sequencing, phylogenomics, and population genetics
to reconstruct the evolution of breeding system diver-
sity in the Hawaiian Islands endemic genus Schiedea.
This project is a collaboration between Norman Wick-
ett (Chicago Botanic Garden), Ann Sakai and Steve
Weller (UC Irvine), Michael Moore (Oberlin), and War-
ren Wagner (National Tropical Botanical Garden and
Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History). The
postdoc will be based at the Chicago Botanic Garden,
where the genome sequencing eorts and, along with
Oberlin, the phylogenomic analyses will be based.
The postdoc will be responsible for coordinating and
conducting the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of
three Schiedea genomes. The position includes the anal-
ysis of genome content and structure association with
the diversication of the genus, with an emphasis on
the phylogenetic reconstruction of species and breeding
system diversity and the history of hybridization. We
expect that the postdoc will contribute to the prepara-
tion of numerous publications, many of which will be
rst-authored. Field work in the Hawaiian Islands will
occur in each year, and we will encourage the postdoc
to participate for several weeks per year. This eld
work may involve hiking in steep mountains in dicult
conditions.Teaching and curriculum development oppor-

Vincent Richards??? lab in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Clemson University is accepting applications
for a post-doctoral position.
The postdoc will join a ve-year NIH/R01 funded
project to investigate the inuence that childhood HIV
infection has on the dental microbiome and tooth decay
(caries). Childhood caries is a serious public health
problem aecting the immediate and long-term qual-
ity of life of both the child and its family, and recent
studies have shown an increased prevalence of caries in
HIV-infected children. Making use of a large cohort of
HIV+ children in Nigeria, the project will utilize multi-124 EvolDir November 1, 2018
ple omic approaches to determine the interplay between
the dental microbiome, adaptive immunity, and the de-
velopment of caries. Ultimately, the knowledge gained
will translate into improved prevention and intervention
strategies that could potentially mitigate an increased
risk of caries and hopefully provide an improved quality
of life for children suering with HIV infection.
Beyond publications generated from the HIV project,
many additional projects focusing on the oral micro-
biome and how it pertains to oral health are possi-
ble. The postdoc will be free to explore and lead such
projects. The postdoc will take a senior position within
the laboratory and contribute to the mentoring of grad-

Cornell EcolEvolutionaryGenomics
**** Postdoc in ecological genomics of balanced poly-
morphisms ****
The Hare Lab at Cornell University is recruiting a post-
doc with diverse skills to lead genomic aspects of a
collaborative NSF-funded project to identify and spa-
tially map balanced polymorphisms underlying oyster
tolerance to low salinity. We are testing the hypothesis
that short-term adaptive responses to environmentalstress can involve distinct genetic architectures across a
habitat gradient, even at spatial scales with high gene
ow. These predictions are for the eastern oyster, a
species in which high standing genetic variation and
low linkage disequilibrium facilitate testing for poly-
genic architectures. A rst goal for this study is to
identify candidate genes for tolerance to low-salinity
using whole-genome resequencing of experimental chal-
lenge before/after samples, supported by an available
chromosome-level reference genome. Results will in-
form models of evolutionary response to environmental
change as well as articial selection strategies in breeding
for aquaculture traits.
In general, this study is motivated by the expectation
that dispersing genotypes in high fecundity species will
have phenotype - environment mismatches resulting
in strong viability selection. As a result, functional
genetic dierentiation is generated across small-scale
habitat heterogeneities within each cohort. A second
goal of this project is to measure candidate gene vari-
ation along the estuarine salinity gradient and test for
associations with salinity variation. Field sampling of
Delaware Bay eastern oysters will target larvae, newly-
settled juveniles and adults to measure the extent and
spatial/temporal pattern of recurrent within-generation
selection. Environmental data will provide estimates
of lifetime salinity exposures for oysters from dierent
locations within the estuary, informing two replicate
years of genetic-environment spatial correlation testing.
In addition to collection and analysis of genomic data
at Cornell, this position will include relocation to the
Haskin Shellsh Lab in southern New Jersey during each
summer to lead experimental challenge experiments.
The ideal candidate will have experimental design expe-
rience that informs these experiments. The candidate
also will be encouraged to develop a related, independent
project according to their interests.
Qualications: A PhD in ecological genetics, population
genetics or related eld is required. We are looking for
a creative and productive scientist with strong compu-
tational and bioinformatic skills, good communication
abilities, and a publication record commensurate with
career stage. The ideal candidate will have previous
experience with experimental design generally, or specif-
ically with challenge and/or evolve and resequence ex-
perimental designs. Programming abilities are highly
desirable.
Funding is available for at least 2.5 years, with renewal
after one year contingent on satisfactory performance.

AquaticModelling
Dear Colleagues,
We are looking to ll a 3-year postdoc position in
ecosystem theory, focusing on the eects of chemi-
cal perturbations on ecosystem functioning. We are
particularly looking for individuals in knowledge of
dynamical systems / control theory and a strong
Maths/Physics/Computing/Engineering background.
This position is a key component of a large, multi-
institutional, interdisciplinary UK NERC funded project
(2.4M FEC) led by Professor Guy Woodward at
Imperial, within the new NERC Emerging Chemi-
cals Risks Programme (https://nerc.ukri.org/press/-
releases/2018/30-chemicals/). We will use a novel com-
bination of mathematical theory, ecoinformatics (e.g.,
including analysis of a global traits database), lab ex-
periments and mesocosm experiments to understand
alterations and recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem
functioning following exposure to chemical (and climatic)
stressors.
The ultimate aim of the project is to provide freshwater
bioscientists a new framework for predicting the impacts
of chemical stressors in ecosystems. To develop such
a framework in the context of rapidly changing envi-
ronments we need to move beyond the current relianceon static diversity indices and single-species lab 'ecotox'
models towards a general functional and trait-based
approach that can be used as an integrated diagnostic
tool in any ecosystem.
Akey theoretical challenge will be modelling the micro-
bial component of freshwater aquatic ecosystems.

Lab Institut Pasteur, Paris, France
The huge amount of molecular data available nowa-
days can help addressing new and essential questions in
evolution. However, reconstructing evolution requires
models, algorithms, and statistical and computational
methods of ever increasing complexity. Our Evolution-
ary Bioinformatics Lab aims at developing new methods
and algorithms that are able to tackle eciently the
ever increasing amount of sequence data, in the elds of
phylogenetics and molecular epidemiology. Most of our
phylogenetic methods and software apply to a broad
spectrum of questions, species and sequence, from mam-
mals to viruses, DNA to proteins, and genes to complete
genomes. This results in a strong impact of some of our
papers (e.g. PhyML, Syst Biol 2003 & 2010, ~20,000
citations). We recently published a new version of the
phylogenetic bootstrap (Nature 2018). Our second aim
is to apply these tools (and others) to pathogens, mostly
viruses, and especially HIV. The goals are multiple:
understand their evolution (e.g. the emergence andtransmission of drug resistance mutations, AIDS 2015
& 2016), decipher their genome (e.g. to conrm the
existence of the 10th gene of HIV, PNAS 2016), and
design surveillance tools to control outbreaks. Most
of the current methods to tackle these questions are
based on Bayesian approaches, which are computation-
ally heavy and not able to process the large datasets
available nowadays. Developing methods that scale with
the \deluge" of data is a real challenge, in terms of al-
gorithmics but also modeling. Our LSD software using
quadratic programming for dating molecular phyloge-
nies, is a good example of such an approach. LSD is not
only very fast but also fairly accurate (Syst Biol 2015).
In this context we search for skilled postdocs (18 months
renewable contracts), with strong background in phylo-
genetics, algorithmics, statistical modeling and learning,
and/or molecular epidemiology. Their research projects
will be discussed during application, to t the applicant
ability and vision, and the global strategy of the Lab.
To apply send a unique pdf document containing: a
short CV (1 page); a motivation letter (1 page); your
publication list; three references with contact details, to
support your application.

Postdoc Position: Developing methods and models for
gene-tree species-tree estimation
### Final week for applications ###
I invite applications for a postdoctoral research posi-
tion to develop new methods and models for gene-tree
species-tree estimation in my research group at the
GeoBio-Center of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit at
(LMU), M unchen. The position is funded by the DFG
Emmy Noether program, and is initially available for 2
years, with a further 2 years of funding available depend-
ing on progress and interests. The position should start
on 1 January 2019 or as soon as possible thereafter.
My group is broadly working on theory and compu-
tational methods for Bayesian inference of phylogeny
(http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna). The
research directions include phylogeny inference, diver-
gence time estimation, diversication rate estimation
and model testing. All of our methods are imple-
mented in the open-source program RevBayes ( http://-
www.RevBayes.com) which is the successor software of
the popular program MrBayes. The successful applicant
will be part of our vibrant RevBayes group and will con-
tribute to further development of the program. There
will be opportunities for the successful applicant to work
with and visit the research groups of my collaborators
in Europe and the USA. Furthermore, I expect the can-
didate to become actively involved in our RevBayes
workshops and hackathons.
I have recently been awarded an Emmy Noether grantfrom the DFG (German Science Foundation) which
will fund at least 3 positions over the next 5 years.
This advertisement is for one of these positions and
the applicant will join a young, dynamic and rapidly
growing group. My group will be moving to the GeoBio-
Center of the LMU Munich, one of Europe's top Uni-
versities (#32 world-wide; #8 in Europe; #1 in Ger-
many; https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-
university-rankings/lmu-munich). The GeoBio-Center
is located at the K onigsplatz which is in walking distance
to the historic city center (Marienplatz) and English
Garden (city park with 3.75 km' area). The GeoBio-
Center is highly interdisciplinary and consists of re-
searchers from dierent departments including paleon-
tology, molecular and evolutionary biology, zoology and
botany.
The main question the postdoctoral researcher will work
on is how to model biological processes that explain
gene tree incongruence by developing models for gene-
tree species-tree inference using genomic data. The
process should model incomplete lineage sorting due to
the multi-species coalescent, migration/hybridization
between closely related species, and gene duplication
and loss events. The models should be implemented in
our software RevBayes using C++ for computational
eciency. Additionally, the postdoctoral researcher
should perform simulation studies of the new models,
apply them to empirical data, and lead the writing of
manuscripts describing the work.
Applicants must have completed their PhD by the posi-
tion start date, with degrees in in evolutionary biology,
computer science, mathematics, statistics, or a related
eld. The candidate must be enthusiastic and capable
of working independently. Additionally, prociency in
programming and C++ and experience in phylogenetic
methods development as well as Bayesian statistics are
preferred skills. There will also be opportunities for the
postdoc to develop their own, independent research ideas
that are complementary to the goals of this project.
The position will be compensated according to the stan-
dard DFG salary scheme (TVL-E13 to E14 based on
prior experience). The salary is very competitive and
includes benets such as health care, pension, unem-
ployment insurance and child support (if applicable).
Further information can be found at http://-
www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/hoehna, and questions
should be directed to Sebastian H ohna (phylomat-
ics@gmail.com). Applications, including a current CV,
letter of motivation (1 page) and names and contact de-
tails of two referees should be sent to Sebastian H ohna
before the deadline of 31 October 2018. The review
process will begin on November 1st and applications132 EvolDir November 1, 2018
will be considered until the position is lled.

GeneDrivePopulationGenetics
Postdoc: Population Genetics of Gene Drive and Insec-
ticide Resistance in Mosquitoes
OVERVIEW: We recently received funding from NIH
for a project titled 'Combining Aedes aegypti genomics
and modeling to improve gene drive strategies and our
understanding of insecticide resistance evolution'. Aedes
aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, Zika, chikun-
gunya, and urban yellow-fever. This project will fund
two postdocs; one who will do the genomics and bioin-
formatics (individual already identied), and a second
to work on the mathematical modeling aspects (this
position).
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Although the idea of us-
ing selsh genetic elements to drive specic transgenes
into populations was proposed over 40 years ago, it is
only recently with the advent of CRISPR-based gene
editing technology that this approach has gained broad
attention from researchers and the news media.
The most straightforward approaches for building gene
drives using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are theoreti-
cally expected to result in spread of the gene drive to
individuals in all populations that are connected by even
minimal gene ow. These approaches are appropriate in
some cases but in others there are concerns about spread
into non-target areas. Detailed mathematical models
are needed to understand the dynamics of spread and
the potential for resistance evolving to these gene drive
mechanisms. More complex approaches have been pro-
posed for developing gene drives that are spatial and/or
temporally limited. More novel molecular approaches ac-
companied by population genetics modeling are needed
for development of these restricted gene drives.
We aim at building mathematical models for assisting
the design and deployment of gene drives for suppressing
or altering the characteristics of Aedes aegypti, the main
vector of dengue virus that impacts over 100 million
people a year. Ae. aegypti has substantial ne scale
population structure but detailed parameter estimates
are lacking. Other work within the project is focused on
accurately estimating these parameters through genomic
approaches.
Ae. aegypti has rapidly evolved resistance to insecticides.
We have a large number of samples of adult mosquitoesNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 135
(>20,000) over a 17-year period during which a number
of resistance mechanisms have evolved. We will use ge-
nomics data and modeling to determine the population
structure of the mosquitoes so we can test a number of
hypotheses about the dynamics of resistance evolution.
JOB DESCRIPTION: The postdoc in this position will
lead modeling eorts to achieve both of the project
goals|understanding the dynamics of insecticide resis-
tance and developing and assessing novel gene drive
approaches. General and more detailed models will be
developed and explored. Our project is strengthened
by collaborations with a number of labs in the US and
in Peru. The postdoc will interact with members of
these other research groups. There will be an opportu-
nity for some work in Peru. The initial appointment is
for two-years with funding for extension beyond that
period.
QUALIFICATIONS: We are looking for a postdoc with
a solid background in population biology and popula-
tion genetics who has experience with modeling and
who wants to do applied research. Experience with
C++ or related languages is desirable. Ability to work
independently and as a member of a team is essential.

*Sabanc ~A\^AUniversity Post Doc/Graduate Student
positions are open in the Mayack Lab*
A master's student and postdoc position funded by
a Turkey TUBITAK grant is available in Christopher
Mayack's lab at Sabanc ~A"^AUniversity located in
Istanbul, Turkey. Interested students in becoming a
PhD student are welcome to apply as well. The post
doc, PhD, and Master's position can begin as early as
February 11th, 2019, although the start date is nego-
tiable. Full research scholarship funding is available for
the Master's and post doc position for two years. Full
TAship support is available for four years for interested
students in pursuing a PhD.
The project is entitled \Regulation of honey bee appetite
independent of the glucose insulin signaling pathway".This project will be carried out in collaboration with
neighboring Batu Erman's lab at Sabanc ~A\^AUni-
versity but be led by the Mayack lab. The goal of the
project is to determine if appetite levels are linked to
uctuating trehalose levels in the bee hemolymph and
to see if this is mediated by octopomine release in the
brain. Overall, the project seeks to develop a general
theory for how the honey bee forager is able to rapidly
and precisely control its appetite with large uctuating
demands in energy consumption. A mechanism inde-
pendent of the glucose-signaling pathway, which more
directly links the energetic state of the individual to
appetite levels may play a major role in the rapid and
precise regulation of appetite. Students will be involved
in measuring honey bee appetite using the Proboscis
Extension Assay, injecting sugars and pharmacological
reagents into honey bees, quantifying neurotransmitters
using HPLC and qPCR, using immunohistochemistry
to map octopamine subtype receptors in the bee brain,
and CRISPR-CAS-9 techniques for octopamine receptor
knockdown.
For the post doc position, the successful candidate will
have completed or be near completion of a PhD degree in
the area of the neurobiology, insect physiology, or related
areas. Experience in conducting brain micro-injections,
CRISPR-CAS 9, HPLC, qPCR, and immunohistochem-
istry for brain mapping is desired. Managing or working
with honey bees in the eld or lab is considered a plus.
The ideal candidate will also have experience in statistics
and systems biology for involvement with other ongoing
projects.

Postdoctoral Research Associate
Speciation Genomics
Delmore Lab, Texas A&M University

Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed
us to answer questions in the speciation literature we
couldn't even begin to approach before. These advances
have also resulted in the generation of new exciting
questions in speciation genomics. We are searching for
a Postdoctoral Research Associate to lead a project on
this topic.
One example of a research avenue we are interested in is
the observation that estimates dierentiation between
closely related populations and across the genome are
often highly variable. Divergent selection at \speciation
genes" and gene ow were initially proposed to explain
these patterns but the importance of linked selection
has recently been highlighted. Linked selection itself
could result from positive or negative selection which
may or may not carry over from past speciation events.
Take a look at the publications below to see the kind of142 EvolDir November 1, 2018
work we have already done on this topic. We encourage
applicants to bring their own ideas as well and are open
to work on dierent aspects of speciation genomics.

the conifer foliage microbiome.
The successful candidate will contribute to ongoing re-

with foliage of western high elevation conifers.
The specic research focus involves characterizing the
taxa responsible for nitrogen xation in conifer foliage.
Recent ndings suggest that both evergreen and decid-
uous trees have the potential to directly access atmo-
spheric N via N2-xing bacteria in the foliage. These
ndings are important to our understanding of how
plants in N-limited ecosystems meet their N demand,
and to balancing ecosystem N budgets. Illumina se-
quencing of the 16S rRNA gene has shown that the
conifer microbiome is largely consistent across species
and geographic sites, with several potential N2-xing
uncultured taxa dominating the community.
The successful candidate will use a combination of en-
richment of bacterial cells and DNA; metagenomics and
single cell genome (SAG) sequencing; amplication of
nitrogenase (nif) genes using PNA PCR blockers to
exclude conifer nif homologs; designing and using nif
primers for specic groups of bacteria; and bioinformat-

research-fellow Deep homology of spiral cleavage in
lophotrochozoan embryology:
Comparative single cell sequencing of early embryonic
stages of spirally cleaving animals. Lophotrochozoan an-
imal phyla (including molluscs, annelids and atworms)
diverged in the Cambrian. Despite this great evolution-
ary distance, these animals share a unique pattern of
early cell divisions called spiral cleavage.
Professor Max Telford's research group want to test
whether this extraordinary phenotypic conservation is
underpinned by comparable genetic conservation and
are wishing to appoint a postdoctoral research associate
to work on this project.
The three year project, funded by the Leverhulme trust,
aims to read the genes expressed in individual early blas-
tomeres of dierent spirally cleaving spiralian embryos
and to compare the genetic programmes of this process
across phyla.
Using newly-developed single cell sequencing technology,
we will sequence mRNAs of equivalent blastomeres from
dierent phyla to establish the degree to which devel-
opmental deployment of gene expression is conserved
across Lophotrochozoa. Ultimately we aim to under-
stand the genetic basis of the extraordinary conservation
of this developmental process.

GutEcosystemDynamics
Postdoc - University of Edinburgh - The ecology and
evolution of gut ecosystems in a wild mammal
Applications are invited for a full-time Post-doctoral Re-
search Associate position to work as part of a recently
awarded large NERC grant, entitled: \The Ecology
Within: The impact of gut ecosystem dynamics on
host tness in the wild." This is a multi-disciplinary,
multi-institution award, which will use repeat sampling,
meta-barcoding and meta-genomics techniques to ex-
plore the causes and consequences of gut community
structure in wild sheep. While there is growing appre-
ciation for the role that our gut \microbiota" plays in
human health and nutrition, we know surprisingly little
about the drivers of variation in gut community struc-
ture and how gut community dynamics impact host
health and tness in the wild. This project will address
these questions using data collected by the long-term
study of Soay Sheep on the remote St Kilda archipelago.
Over the next four years, we will be regularly collecting
faecal samples from known individual sheep in our study
population on St Kilda. These samples will be used to
assess the community structure of bacteria, nematodes
and protozoans present, and to assess the plant species
composition to assess diet.
The post-holder will develop and use novel statistical
methods to assess the roles of environment, diet, and
host genetics in driving the composition of the gut mi-
crobiota, and assess the eects of the gut microbiota on
host survival and reproduction. You will be part of a
large, dynamic research team, involving 12 investigators
from 6 dierent institutions and up to 8 project sta.
You will be a key part of this team, and there will be
opportunities to collaborate with other team members
on these other aspects of the project. The job will based
in Luke McNally's laboratory in the Institute of Evolu-
tionary Biology, also working closely with Andrew Free's
laboratory in the Institute of Quantitative Biology, Bio-
chemistry and Biotechnology, as well as collaboration
with other collaborators from ecology, parasitology, and
genetics backgrounds.
The post is full time and available from 1st March 2019
for 36 months.
Applicants should have (or be near completion of) a PhDin an appropriate biological science, computer science,
statistics, or related subjects. The candidate should
also have excellent coding ability in R or similar pro-
gramming language, and experience in either microbial
bioinformatics or quantitative genetics.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COMPARATIVE
TRANSCRIPTOMICS: POSITION NUMBER 26426
DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, UNI-
VERSITY OF MANITOBA, CANADA POSITION
START DATE: January 1, 2019 or as soon afterwards
as possible. CLOSING DATE FOR APPLICATIONS:
November 1, 2018, or until the position is lled. RANK:
Postdoc SALARY RANGE: $45,000 per year (plus ben-
ets) for 2 years.
PROJECT OVERVIEW: The compound 3-
triuoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) has been
used as a lampricide in the Great Lakes of North
America for more than 50 years. TFM is highly toxic
to lampreys relative to non-target shes that are able
to detoxify TFM. In contrast, niclosamide, also used
as a lampricide, is highly toxic to lampreys and other
shes. A mixture of TFM + 1-2% niclosamide enhances
TFM toxicity; however, the mechanisms involved in the
interaction of TFM and niclosamide are unknown. This
work will use a comparative transcriptomics approach
to characterize the complex cellular responses in the
gill and liver of sea lamprey relative to a non-target
TFM-tolerant teleost sh, the bluegill, after exposure to
TFM, niclosamide, and a TFM and niclosamide mixture.
Dierentially expressed genes and cellular pathways
aected by exposure will be identied and physiological
biomarkers of TFM or niclosamide exposure will be
measured to link changes in gene expression with
established physiological endpoints.
The project objectives are to identify genes involved
in the larval sea lamprey's response to TFM and
niclosamide on their own and in a mixture and to com-
pare these responses with those of the bluegill to identify
lamprey-specic responses to lampricide treatments to
aid in future sea lamprey control in the Great Lakes.
The successful applicant will a join a collaborative team
that involves researchers at the University of Manitoba
(Drs. Ken Jeries, Margaret Docker, Colin Garroway),
Wilfrid Laurier University (Drs. Mike Wilkie, Jonathan
Wilson) and the University of Regina (Dr. Richard
Manzon).
JOB DESCRIPTION: The primary task of this positionNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 153
will be to perform the transcriptome assemblies and
the dierential expression analyses on tissues from the
lampricide exposure studies. However, the postdoc will
also have the opportunity to pursue their own research
questions as well as contribute to other projects.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
* To conduct research on the transcriptomic eects of
lampricide exposure in sea lamprey and bluegill. To
contribute signicantly to experimental design, data in-
terpretation and statistical analysis. Potentially to assist
with the lampricide exposures. * Disseminate research
through publications in peer reviewed journals, presenta-
tions at conferences, and assisting with the preparation
of progress and nal reports. * To attend and contribute
to research seminars, lab and departmental meetings. *
Assist other researchers with analyses and research.
QUALIFICATIONS:
* PhD in toxicogenomics, ecological genomics, or bioin-
formatics. * Proven ability to process, analyse and
interpret RNA- sequencing data. * Prociency with
analysis software and programming languages, as well
as ability to write or adapt scripts for dierential ex-
pression analysis. * Highly independent, however with
the ability to work collaboratively as part of a team.
* Well-developed leadership, management and student
mentoring skills.

tions for speciation and regional community structure.
For applicants with interests in herpetology, the project
is an opportunity to engage in exciting and broadly
comparative studies across dozens or hundreds of taxa,
focusing on two of the world's most iconic hotspots for
squamate biodiversity. Rabosky and collaborators on
this project have active eld research programs on rep-
tile ecology & biodiversity in Australia and throughout
the neotropics, and the position oers opportunities for
eldwork in these regions. The project oers additional
potential for collections-based research on reptiles and
the successful applicant will be part of a dynamic group
of researchers aliated with the U-M Museum of Zool-
ogy, one of the world's largest herpetological research

The work will focus on improving and applying methods
for testing the inuence of traits on lineage diversica-
tion. One line of attack is developing new model-based
phylogenetic comparative methods, targeting known
weaknesses in existing approaches. The other is cre-
ating tools for more robust use of existing and future
methods, including designing benchmark test suites and
tests of model adequacy. Empirical work will make
use of extensive datasets on plant reproductive systems
and chromosome counts, and it has the potential to
make one of the strongest cases yet for the importance
of species selection. The postdoc will also contribute
to new workshops teaching phylogenetic comparative
methods, to be held in the Midwest US and in Israel.

ments, population genomics, and mathematical model-
ing to investigate the evolution of character displacement
and reinforcement between incipient species of Clarkia
xantiana, an annual plant with a long history of research
in evolutionary biology.
Some of the major goals of the project are to (1) ex-
amine the role of natural selection in the evolution of
reproductive character displacement using a combina-
tion of mathematical models and eld experiments, (2)
quantify the ecological and genetic costs of hybrid for-
mation using eld experiments and genomic analysis,
and (3) assess the consequences of pre- and post-zygotic
isolating mechanisms for genome-wide patterns of in-
trogression. As a part of the broader project, we are
sequencing and assembling the genome of C. xantiana.
For the initial postdoc hire, we are particularly inter-
ested in a candidate with interests in mathematical
modeling and genomic analysis. The ideal candidate
has expertise in one of these areas along with serious
interest in developing skills in another aspect of the
project. The postdoc would be expected to contribute
primarily to this funded project, but would also have

A second postdoc hire will be made in the near future.
For that position, we are particularly interested in can-
didates with expertise in ecological genetics and eld
experimentation, along with interests in developing skills
in genomic analysis. We would be happy to discuss this
position and timing if interested.

UVermont EvolutionOfEpigenetics
Post-doctoral Research Associate - Epigenetics of ther-
mal plasticity in Drosophila
A post-doctoral position is available in the Helms Ca-
han lab at the University of Vermont to join a new
NSF/EPSCoR-funded project on epigenetic regulation
of thermal plasticity in Drosophila. The overarching
goals of the project are to characterize and test molec-
ular mechanisms driving plastic adjustment of upper
and lower thermal limits occurring across a range of
timescales, from developmental acclimation to rapid
hardening, and role of shifts in epigenetic drivers in the
process of thermal adaptation within and among species
across the genus. The post-doctoral associate will use
cutting-edge approaches in high-throughput sequencing
and bioinformatic network analysis to identify putative
epigenetic regulators in D. melanogaster and experimen-
tally test their roles using functional genetic techniques.
The successful candidate will join a multi-investigator
collaborative team with complementary expertise in
epigenomics and systems biology (Seth Frietze, UVM),
biochemical adaptation and thermal physiology (Nick
Teets, UKY and Brent Lockwood, UVM), insect respira-164 EvolDir November 1, 2018
tory physiology (James Waters, Providence College) and
phylogeography (Heather Axen, Salve Regina Univ.).
There will be plenty of opportunities for additional self-
designed projects in the candidate's area of interest.
The Biology Department at the University of Vermont
is a research-intensive integrative department, with
internationally-recognized faculty conducting both the-
oretical and empirical research in disciplines from cells
to ecosystems. The department has a vibrant PhD
program and is dedicated to a teacher-scholar model
of engaging undergraduates in the research enterprise.
Founded in 1791, UVM is consistently ranked as one of
the top public universities in the United States. The
University is located in Burlington, Vermont, a vibrant
and environmentally-minded small city rich in cultural
and recreational activities for graduate students and

Applicants for the position should have a strong inter-
est in evolutionary genetics and a PhD in a relevant
discipline. Familiarity with high-throughput genomics
benchwork and/or bioinformatics, and prior experience
working with Drosophila or other insects, are desir-
able. The position is available beginning January 1 for
two years, with the possibility of renewal. Our team

UZurich EvolutionaryEcol
Postdoc position in Evolutionary Ecology
On: Theory of sexual and asexual reproduction in the
context of ontogeny and senescenceat the University of Zurich, Switzerland
A postdoctoral position in evolutionary ecology, of
36 months duration, is available at the University of
Zurich working with Prof Hanna Kokko and her interna-
tional team www.kokkonuts.org. This position is funded
through the Swiss National Science Foundation.
We are a team that places a lot of emphasis on creat-
ing theoretical work that integrates well with empirical
ndings. We work on life history theory (and data),
interpreted in a very broad sense: examples include
life histories of modular organisms, facultative sex, spa-
tial evolution, and sexual dimorphism in a broad sense
(including e.g. dispersal polymorphisms). The most
up to date version of our current interests can be best
described by the list of journal club articles that we
discuss each week (www.kokkonuts.org, click on journal
club'). This implicitly denes our current interests, and
applicants will quickly notice that they are broad. In-
deed, this matches the breadth of the advertised topic:
within it, the applicant could emphasize either genetic or
demographic factors, or unicellular/multicellular angles
to understand questions such as 'when does life choose
mitosis, when on the other hand is meiosis the way
to go, and what are the implications for the evolution
of generation time?' There is great exibility within
this broad framework to identify the most interesting
questions.
The working language in the group is English (German
skills are not essential). The position is available from
January 1st, 2019 onwards. The evaluation of applica-
tions begins on November 1st, 2018, and will continue
until a suitable candidate has been found.
Applicants should send a cover letter with a
- Statement of their research interests, in relation to the
topic (and potentially journal club articles as mentioned
above)
- C.V. (including publication list), and
- The names and contact details of at least one referee.
Applications should form a single pdf le and this should
be sent to: hanna.kokko@ieu.uzh.ch

When: 1-5 April 2019
Where: Botanisches Museum, Konigin-Luise-Strae 6-8,
Berlin (Germany)
Instructors:
Dr. Antti Karkman (University of Gothenburg, Sweden)
Dr. Anna Sandionigi (University of Milan Bicocca,
Italy)
Dr. Bruno Fosso (Institute of Biomem-
brane,Bioenergetics and Molecular Biotechnologies,
CNR, Italy)
Overview
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
application of metabarcoding techniques in microbial
ecology. The topics covered by the course range from
bioinformatic processing of next-generation sequencing
data to the most important approaches in multivariate
statistics. Using a combination of theoretical lectures
and hands-on exercises, the participants will learn the
most important computational steps of a metabarcoding
study from the processing of raw sequencing reads down
to the nal statistical evaluations. After completing
the course, the participants should be able to under-
stand the potential and limitations of metabarcoding
techniques as well as to process their own datasets to
answer the questions under investigation.
Format
This course is designed for researchers and students with
strong interests in applying novel high-throughput DNA
sequencing technologies to answer questions in the area
of community ecology and biodiversity. The course will
mainly focus on the analysis of phylogenetic markers
to study bacterial, archaeal and fungal assemblages in
the environment, but the theoretical concepts and com-
putational procedures can be equally applied to anytaxonomic group or gene of interest.
Assumed Background
The participants should have some basic background
in biology and understand the central role of DNA for
biodiversity studies. No programming or scripting ex-
pertise is required and some basic introduction to UNIX-
based command line applications will be provided on
the rst day. However, some basic experience with using
command line and/or R is clearly an advantage as not
all the basics can be thoroughly covered in that short
amount of time. All hands-on exercises will be run in
UNIX-environments (Linux, Mac) on remote servers.
Statistical analyses will be run in R using RStudio.
Learning Outcomes
1) Understanding the concept, potential and limitation
of microbial metabarcoding techniques.
2) Learning how to process raw sequencing reads to
obtain meaningful information.
3) Obtaining experience on how to statistically evaluate
and visualize your data.
4) Being able to make informed decisions on best prac-
tices for your own data.

course4/ Berlin, 4-8 March 2019, Berlin (Germany)
Instructors:
Dr. Vasco Elbrecht (University of Guelph, Canada)
Dr. Owen S. Wangensteen (University of Tromso, Nor-
way)
Course Overview
Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic
tools for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing bio-
diversity of natural communities. Their potential appli-
cations include (but are not limited to) accurate water
quality, soil diversity assessment, trophic analyses of
digestive contents, diagnosis of health status of sh-
eries, early detection of non-indigenous species, studies
of global ecological patterns and biomonitoring of an-
thropogenic impacts. This workshop gives an overview
of metabarcoding procedures with an emphasis on prac-
tical problem-solving and hands-on work using analysis
pipelines on real datasets. After completing the work-
shop, students should be in a position to (1) understand
the potential and capabilities of metabarcoding, (2) run
complete analyses of metabarcoding pipelines and obtain
diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable data
from raw next-generation sequence data and (3) design
their own metabarcoding projects, including bioinfor-
matic data analysis and planning of laboratory work. All
course materials (including copies of presentations, prac-
tical exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared
by the instructing team) will be provided electronically
to participants.
Intended audience
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research and at researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing com-
munity of metabarcoders worldwide. This workshopwill review mostly techniques and software useful for
eukaryotic metabarcoding. Other workshops focused on
procedures currently used in microbial metabarcoding
will be available from Physalia-courses.
Teaching format
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours
of practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's
discretion.
Assumed background
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run either in Linux or Mac environments, with some
ssh connections to remote servers. For Windows users,
a virtual box running Linux under Windows and/or
the installation of an ssh client (e.g. PuTTY) will be
needed. For MacOSX systems, installation of some ad-
ditional Python packages might be needed for running
the OBITools software suite. The syllabus has been
planned for people which have some previous experience
running simple commands from a terminal in Linux or
Mac and using the R environment (preferently RStudio)
for performing basic plots and statistical procedures.
You will need to have a laptop with Python 2.7 installed
for running OBITools, but no experience with Python
is necessary.

Berlin GeneSetPathwayAnalysisInR
Mar11-15
Dear all,
we will run the third edition of our Workshop \SqueezingNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 171
biology out of statistics: Gene set and pathway analysis
in HT data" from the 11th to the 15th of March 2019.
Our instructor for this course is Dr. January Weiner
(Sta Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Infection
Biology, Germany).
This course oers computational techniques that go
beyond a simple technical or statistical analysis. It cov-
ers techniques for the analysis of gene set enrichments,
pathway analysis, gene ontologies, functional analysis
of metabolomic proling and making use of correlations
and coexpression networks. A prominent part of the
course will be devoted to data visualization and visual
data exploration.
The students will gain the ability to independently pro-
cess and analyse HT data sets, select the appropriate
tools, functionally interpret the results as well as learn
the paradigms of computational biology and statistics
which will allow them to eciently communicate with
computational biologists.
As an incentive, each student will receive a set of gene
expression proles for a dierent organism, and during
the course they will use these to generate species-specic
gene expression modules and test their utility. If we are
successfull, we will attempt a joint publication.

Berlin GeometricMorphometrics
Mar18-22
Dear all,
registration is now open for our second edition of the
course \Geometric Morphometrics"!Where: Berlin (Germany)
When: 18th-22nd March 2019
Instructor: Dr. Carmelo Fruciano (ENS, Paris (France))
http://bit.ly/2rxQVFC Overview
Geometric morphometrics has become a standard in
biological research because it combines statistical rigour
and ease of interpretation. Through geometric morpho-
metrics, biological form is quantied, analysed and the
results are expressed as easily interpretable and visually
impactful shape changes. This course covers the main
common practices of modern geometric morphometrics,
including: acquiring data, analysing it, visualizing and
interpreting the results.
Format
The course will be delivered over ve days and will
comprise both lectures and hands-on sessions. The
lectures will cover both basic theoretical aspects and
their practical implementation in research practice and
software. During the hands-on sessions, the attendees
will have the chance of both using example datasets
and applying the knowledge acquired to their own data.
The course will be focused mainly on 2D data and on
easy-to-use software with graphical user interface to
maximize the ability to understand concepts and apply
them. However, some information on 3D data and on
R implementations will be provided, as appropriate.
Assumed Background
This course is aimed at beginners and intermediate users.
In other words, it is aimed at researchers who intend
to use geometric morphometrics or who have started
performing geometric morphometric analyses but feel
they need a more structured background.
Requirements
Attendees should have a background in biology and a
basic understanding of statistical concepts.

Berlin PythonDataVisualization
Dec10-14
Course: Data Manipulation and Visualization with
Python
Berlin, 10th-14th December 2018
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course38/ )
INSTRUCTOR:
DR. Martin Jones (founder, Python for biologists: (
https://bit.ly/2ycQ25u ) )
This course focusses on using Python's scientic soft-
ware libraries to manipulate and visualise large datasets.It's intended for researchers with a basic knowledge of
Python who need to explore large datasets and quickly
visualise patterns and relationships.
This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers
with a background in biology and a basic knowledge of
Python (if you've taken the Introductory Python course
then you have the Python knowledge; if you're not sure
whether you know enough Python to benet from this
course then just drop us an email).
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the example datasets. They
should also have some basic Python experience (the
Introduction to Python course will fulll these require-
ments). Students should be familiar with the use of
lists, loops, functions and conditions in Python and
have written at least a few small programs from scratch.
Students will require the scientic Python stack to be
installed on their laptops before attending; instructions
for this will be sent out prior to the course.
Detailed syllabus
1. Introduction and datasets
Jupyter (formerly iPython) is a programming environ-
ment that is rapidly becoming the de facto standard for
scientic data analysis. In this session we'll learn why
Jupyter is so useful, covering its ability to mix notes and
code, to render inline plots, charts and tables, to use
custom styles and to create polished web pages. We'll
also take a look at the datasets that we'll be investigat-
ing during the course and discuss the dierent types of
data we encounter in bioinformatics work.
2. Introduction to pandas
In this session we introduce the rst part of the scientic
Python stack: the pandas data manipulation package.
We'll learn about Dataframes 'X the core data struc-
ture that much of the rest of the course will rely on 'X
and how they allow us to quickly select, sort, lter and
summarize large datasets. We'll also see how to extend
existing Dataframes by writing functions to create new
columns, as well as how to deal with common problems
like missing or inconsistent values in datasets. We'll
get our rst look at data visualisation by using pandas'
built in plotting ability to investigate basic properties
of our datasets.
3. Grouping and pivoting with pandas
This session continues our look at pandas with advanced
uses of Dataframes that allow us to answer more com-
plicated questions. We'll look two very powerful tools:
grouping, which allows us to aggregate information in
datasets, and pivoting/stacking, which allows us to ex-
ibly rearrange data (a key step in preparing datasetsNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 173
for visualisation). In this session we'll also go into more
detail about pandas indexing system.
4. Advanced manipulation with pandas
In this nal session on the pandas library we'll look at a
few common types of data manipulation 'X binning data
(very useful for working with time series), carrying out
principal component analysis, and creating networks.
We'll also cover some features of pandas designed for
working with specic types of data like timestamps and
ordered categories.
5. Introduction to seaborn
This session introduces the seaborn charting library by
showing how we can use it to investigate relationships
between dierent variables in our datasets. Initially we
concentrate on showing distributions with histograms,
scatter plots and regressions, as well as a few more ex-
otic chart types like hexbins and KDE plots. We also
cover heatmaps, in particular looking at how they lend
themselves to displaying the type of aggregate data that
we can generate with pandas.
6. Categories in seaborn
This session is devoted to seaborn's primary use case:
visualising relationships across multiple categories in
complex datasets. We see how we can use colour and
shape to distinguish categories in single plots, and how
these features work together with the pandas tools we
have already seen to allow us to very quickly explore a
dataset. We continue by using seaborn to build small
multiple or facet plots, separating categories by rows
and columns. Finally, we look at chart types that are
designed to show distributions across categories: box
and violin plots, and the more exotic swarm and strip
plots.
7. Customisation with seaborn
For the nal session on seaborn, we go over some com-
mon types of customisation that can be tricky. To
achieve very ne control over the style and layout of our
plots, we'll learn how to work directly with axes and
chart objects to implement things like custom heatmap
labels,

Dear all, the registration deadline is soon approaching
(4th Nov) and we still have the last 3 places available
for our Speciation Genomics course.
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course37/ )
Where: Berlin, BGBM/FU University
When: 03-07 December 2018
Instructors: Dr. Mark Ravinet (CEES, Univeristy of
Oslo, Norway) Dr. Joana I. Meier (University of Cam-
bridge, UK)
This course will provide a thorough introduction to the
growing eld of speciation genomics. The course aims
to take students from the initial steps required for han-
dling raw sequencing data to demographic modelling
and inference of genome-wide signatures of selection
and introgression. Through a combination of lectures
covering key theoretical and conceptual topics, along-
side hands-on exercises, participants will learn the most
important computational approaches used in speciation
genomics. This will include a heavy emphasis on data
visualization and intepretation. After completing of
the course, the participants should be able to begin
using NGS data to shed light on the genomic aspects of
speciation in their study system of choice.

ICS at Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay, Cali-
fornia
May 25-June 2, 2019
Sponsored by the University of California, Davis and
Bodega Marine Laboratory
website: http://treethinkers.org/ Introduction Phyloge-
netic methods have revolutionized modern systematics
and become indispensable tools in evolution, ecology
and comparative biology, playing an increasingly impor-
tant role in analyses of biological data at all levels of
organization ranging from molecules to ecological com-
munities. The estimation of phylogenetic trees is now a
formalized statistical problem with general agreement
on the central issues and questions. A nearly standard
set of topics is now taught as part of the curriculum
at many colleges and universities. On the other hand,
application of phylogenetic methods to novel problems
outside systematics is an area of special excitement, in-
novation, and controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
This Spring, for the eighteenth year, we will teach a
workshop for graduate students interested in applying
phylogenetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The
8-day course is an intensive exploration of problems to
which modern phylogenetic approaches are being applied
and the most current statistical tools and methods that
are used to solve those problems. We cover a wide range
of topics in comparative statistical phylogenetics. The
course starts with recent advances in phylogenetic infer-
ence, and then focuses on methods for making inferences
from phylogenies.
The course will be held at the Bodega Marine Laboratory
on the beautiful Northern California coast, which has
on-site housing. The course format will involve equal
parts of lecture and hands-on software training with
an emphasis on performing analyses using RevBayes:
http://revbayes.github.io, with instruction in other in-
ference software (MrBayes, BEAST, etc.) based on
student interest. One afternoon during the week will be
left free for eld trips to local natural areas.
Topics Covered * Estimating, evaluating and interpret-
ing phylogenetic trees * Recent advances in Bayesian
inference of phylogeny * Model specication: model se-lection, adequacy and uncertainty * Diagnosing MCMC

Introduction to bioinformatics for DNA and RNA se-quence analysis (IBDR01)
Delivered by Dr. Malachi Grith
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-bioinformatics-for -dna-and-rna-sequence-analysis-
ibdr01/
Course Overview:
Analysis of high throughput genome and transcriptome
data is major component of many research projects rang-
ing from large-scale precision medicine eorts to focused
investigations in model systems. This analysis involves
the identication of specic genome or transcriptome
features that predispose individuals to disease, predict
response to therapies, inuence diagnosis/prognosis, or
provide mechanistic insights into disease models. During
this course (IBDR01), students will perform an example
end-to-end bioinformatics analysis of genome (WGS and
Exome) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. Students
will start with raw sequence data for a hypothetical case,
learn to install and use the tools needed to analyze this
data on the cloud, and visualize and interpret results.
After completing the course, students should be in a po-
sition to (1) understand raw sequence data formats, (2)
perform bioinformatics analyses on the cloud, (3) run
complete analysis pipelines for alignment, variant call-
ing, annotation, and RNA-seq (transcriptome analysis
approaches will be a major component of the workshop),
(4) visualize and interpret whole genome, exome and

The assembly workshop was developed by Dr. Stefan
Prost and has been taught numerous times at Univer-
sities such as Stanford, Ohio State, UC Berkeley and
also at international conferences and the Smithsonian
institute in Washington DC. In this workshop Dr. Prost
will cover the basics of genome assembly up through
downstream analyses. Topic coverage will include:
The various sequencing platforms available for genome
assembly (Illumina -MiSeq and HiSeq-, IonTorrent, ABI
Solid, PacBio, Nanopore and the BGIseq-500). The pros
and cons of preparation methods such as pair-end, mate
pair and 10X genomics linked long-reads, and other
strategies such as Dovetail Genomics' Chicago and the
Hi-C library method. Raw read data processing.De-
Novo assembly strategies and tools.Assessment of
genome assembly quality and improving assembly
through the bioinformatic tools used.Guidance on the
need for a nished vs. a draft genome assembly, what
factors to consider when choosing which approach for
the particular research question.
Please note the level of this workshop is intended for
advanced undergrads, graduate students, post-docs, and
biologists with a background in genetics.
Short-course: Genome Assembly for Biologists
Tentative schedule Basics and A-priori Knowledge of
the Genome to be Sequenced
Prior knowledge about the genome that will be se-
quenced can help in choosing the appropriate sequencing
and assembly strategy. Here, I will cover some basicsand then discuss dierent genome characteristics that
strongly inuence whether a genome will be easy or
dicult to sequence and assemble successfully.
Sequencing Platforms
I will outline dierent 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation
sequencing strategies. The sequencing platforms I
will cover in this section include Illumina (MiSeq and
HiSeq), IonTorrent, ABI Solid, PacBio, Nanopore and
the BGIseq-500.
Sequencing Library Setup
I will discuss the dierences (including pros and cons)
of Illumina library preparation methods, such as paired-
end (PE), mate pair (MP) and 10X genomics Linked
Long-Reads. I will also outline other strategies such as
BAC or fosmid based sequencing and chromosome fold-
ing based long-range linkage methods such as Dovetail
Genomics' Chicago and dierent HiC library methods.
Raw Read Data Processing
In this section, I will talk about tools used to assess, as
well as, improve sequencing read quality.
De-Novo Assembly Strategies and Tools
To make the workshop more useful, I will outline the
dierent popular assembly tools (for assembly of large
genomes) and briey discuss the underlying algorithms.
By doing so, I will also explain terms commonly used
in genome assembly ( e.g. kmer, N50, etc).
Assembly Quality Assessment
A critical step after assembling a genome is assessing
the quality of the resulting sequence. In cases where
dierent assemblers or dierent kmer sizes are used,
tools are needed to decide which of the assemblies is the
best. Bioinformatic Assembly Improvement
There are dierent tools that can be used to improve the
genome sequence after the initial assembly, either by ll-
ing gap regions or nding and resolving mis-assembled
regions. Furthermore, genome assemblies can be merged
to improve quality. Lab-based Assembly Improvement
In this section, I will briey discuss the pros and cons
of Physical and Optical Mapping methods (such as Bio-
Nano's Iryis platform). Draft vs. Finished Assembly
A crucial decision in genomics is whether a genome as-
sembly is good enough to address the desired research
questions. Here, I will explain the dierences between
nished and draft genome assemblies, and give some
guidance on deciding if further sequencing is needed or
not. Downstream Analyses
To conclude the workshop, I will briey outline subse-
quent downstream processing and analyses steps, suchNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 179
as repeat and gene annotation, or how to get a hap-
loid genome sequence into a diploid genome mapping
framework.

Jan28-Feb1
Many of the questions concerning the elds of ecology
and evolution are better represented by multivariate
datasets. The complex relationships observed across an
ecological community, the association among dierent
sets of phenotypic traits and the interaction between
the phenotype and its environment are all fundamental
questions in evolutionary ecology. The description and
comprehension of complex traits is often better achieved
through the quantication and analysis of multiple, fre-
quently interdependent, phenotypic and ecological vari-
ables. The R-language for statistical computing has
been increasingly used by evolutionary ecologists for
statistical inference and hypothesis testing. Being a
comprehensive statistical package with excellent graphi-
cal capabilities and freely available, it has become an
indispensable tool in ecological and evolutionary studies:
many new statistical methods have been developed in
recent years using R and numerous top-rank journals
nowadays favor its use for the publication of scientic
results.
This course is directed towards PhD students interested
in exploring the potential of R language for multivari-
ate analyses in ecology and evolution. The course will
provide a general presentation of major statistical tools
for multivariate analyses, including e.g. exploratory
methods, multivariate GLM, methods for controlling for
evolutionary and ecological non-independence, and it
will provide the participants with the skills for imple-
menting these tools using R.
A good knowledge of basic operations in R (le import,
handling objects, using functions, getting help) is re-
quired and assumed to be able to adequately follow this
course. BIODIV students are encouraged to take the

With the rise of the NGS technologies it is easier every-
day to sequence whole genomes at an aordable price
since the costs have been reduced dramatically. Any re-
search group has the possibility of getting the sequence
of its interest species without being necessary the col-
laboration of big consortium and external sponsors.
This fact makes essential a proper identication and an-
notation of the gene structures for further analysis. Both
eukaryotes and prokaryotes have genes hidden across
their genomes in a dierent way but the procedure to
identify them is quite similar although the eectiveness
diers quite a lot.
In this practical course the students will learn the partic-
ularities of the gene identication in bacteria as well as
in higher organisms. For a better understanding on the
gene function the course will include methodologies for
a good annotation on the identied genes, description
of the annotation terms and databases for retrieving
high quality annotations about functions, metabolic
pathways and protein domains.

FINAL CALL FOR Introduction to bioinformatics
for DNA and RNA sequence analysis (IBDR01)
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-bioinformatics-for-dna-and-rna-sequence-analysis-
ibdr01/ This course will be delivered by Dr. Malachi
Grith in Glasgow city centre from the 29 October-
2 November 2018 Course Overview: Analysis of
high throughput genome and transcriptome data is
major component of many research projects ranging
from large-scale precision medicine eorts to focused
investigations in model systems. This analysis involves186 EvolDir November 1, 2018
the identication of specic genome or transcriptome
features that predispose individuals to disease, predict
response to therapies, inuence diagnosis/prognosis,
or provide mechanistic insights into disease models.
During this course (IBDR01), students will perform an
example end-to-end bioinformatics analysis of genome
(WGS and Exome) and transcriptome (RNA-seq)
data. Students will start with raw sequence data for
a hypothetical case, learn to install and use the tools
needed to analyze this data on the cloud, and visualize
and interpret results. After completing the course,
students should be in a position to (1) understand
raw sequence data formats, (2) perform bioinformatics
analyses on the cloud, (3) run complete analysis
pipelines for alignment, variant calling, annotation, and
RNA-seq (transcriptome analysis approaches will be
a major component of the workshop), (4) visualize
and interpret whole genome, exome and RNA-seq
results, (5) leverage the identication of passenger
variants for immunotherapy applications, and (6) begin
to place these results in a clinical context by use of
variant knowledgebases. The data, tools, and analysis
will be most directly relevant to human genomics and
bioinformatics research. However, many of the skills
and concepts covered will be applicable to other human
diseases and model organisms.
Furthermore, many analysis concepts covered during
the workshop will be broadly applicable to other \big
data" research problems. All course materials (including
copies of presentations, practical exercises, data les,
and example scripts prepared by the instructing team)
will be provided electronically to participants.
Monday 29th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Session 1.
Introduction to genomics and bioinformatics.
In this session, students will be introduced to key con-
cepts of genomics and their application to genomics
research and precision medicine in cancer. An intro-
duction to next-generation sequencing platforms and
related bioinformatics approaches will also be provided.
Core concepts and tools introduced: fundamentals of
genome and transcriptome analysis, next- generation
sequencing, precision/personalized medicine approaches
(using cancer as an exemplar disease).
Session 2. Introduction to genomics data, le formats,
QC, and cloud analysis.
In this session, students will be introduced to a hypo-
thetical patient case and related samples to be analyzed
throughout the course. Students will be provided with
an introduction to the whole genome, exome, transcrip-
tome and other data sets we have generated for this
test case. Information on where to get the raw data
and how to access it (and other test data) will be pro-vided. Using this data as an example, the students will
learn fundamentals of next generation sequence (NGS)
data formats. The students will also be introduced to
accessory les needed for analysis including reference
genomes, reference transcriptomes, and annotation les.
Tools for QC analysis of raw data will be demonstrated.
Since most analysis will be performed on the cloud,
each student will learn how to launch and log into their
own cloud compute environment. Students will learn
how to install bioinformatics tools and learn to use
some of the most broadly useful tool kits for NGS data.
Core concepts and tools introduced: le formats (Fasta,
FastQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF, GTF), bedtools, Pi-
card, samtools, fastQC, cloud computing (AWS, EC2).
Tuesday 30th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30 Session 3.
Primary genome data analysis (sequence alignment and
visualization).
In this session, we will start to complete analysis of
NGS data at the command line. Students will log into
the cloud, and starting with their own copy of the raw
data will align the whole genome and exome data to a
reference genome. Following alignment, students will
conduct a second quality analysis of the data and learn
to visualize alignments in IGV.
Core concepts and tools introduced: alignment algo-
rithms, reference indexes, BWA, BWA-mem, alignment
indexes, alignment ags, genome browsers, duplicate
marking, alignment merging and sorting, IGV.
Session 4. Whole genome and exome variant calling and
annotation.
In this session, we will introduce dierent algorithms
for identifying

FINAL CALL FOR Structural Equation Modelling for
Ecologists and Evolutionary Biologists (SEMR02)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/structural-
equation-modelling-for-ecologists-and-evolutionary-
biologists-semr02/ This course will be delivered by JonNovember 1, 2018 EvolDir 187
Lefcheck (author of the Piecewise package) from the 19
- 23 November 2018.
Final few places available!
Course Overview:
The course is a primer on structural equation modelling
(SEM) and conrmatory path analysis, with an em-
phasis on practical skills and applications to real-world
data. Structural equation modelling is a rapidly growing
technique in ecology and evolution that unites multiple
hypotheses in a single causal network. It provides an
intuitive graphical representation of relationships among
variables, underpinned by well-described mathematical
estimation procedures. Several advances in SEM over
the past few years have expanded its utility for typical
ecological datasets, which include count data, missing
observations, and nested or hierarchical designs.
We will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide
approachable mathematical explanations of the tech-
niques, and cover recent extensions to mixed eects
models and non-normal distributions. Along the way,
we will work through many examples from the primary
literature using the open-source statistical software R
(www.r-project.org). We will draw on two popular R
packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan and
piecewiseSEM.

4bs19-41 . Course description:
Understanding organismal development and its evolu-
tion has been one of the biggest challenges for biology
since its earliest beginnings. It is the central aim of
developmental biology to elucidate the mechanisms un-
derlying pattern formation and morphogenesis. By ex-
tension, evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo)
is also considered a \mechanistic science." But what ex-
actly is meant by \mechanism" in these contexts? Whatis a developmental mechanism? What is a \mechanism"
in developmental evolution? How do these \mechanisms"
contribute to evolutionary change? The answer to these
fundamental questions is far from clear. And yet, clarity
on this foundational conceptual issue is essential for re-
search progress, not only in development and evolution
but far beyond, as the nature of the term \mechanism"
determines the questions we ask and the explanations
that are accepted as valid in disciplines across the life
and cognitive sciences.
We have gathered a select group of world-leading em-
pirical investigators and theoreticians from the eld
of developmental biology and evo-devo together with
modelers and philosophers of biology to discuss what
\mechanism" means, and what kind of properties the
concept should incorporate to guide productive new re-
search and the integration of developmental biology and
evolutionary theory. This integration lies at the very
heart of modern biology. Its relevance transcends the
scope of evo-devo, since an understanding of the map-
ping from genotype to phenotype through metabolism,
physiology, and development is also crucial in other
elds, such as the genetic study of complex disease, or
organismal behaviour.
This course is mainly aimed at early-stage (PhD or post-
doc) empirical and theoretical researchers with a general
background and interest in developmental and/or evolu-
tionary biology. More senior investigators are welcome
to apply as well. Exceptions can be made for motivated
masters students. Participants of previous Venice Sum-
mer Schools in Evo-Devo are expressly encouraged to
reapply as this course has an entirely dierent topic.
The course will equip participants with the conceptual
tools to engage in a productive discussion of the notion
of \mechanism" and to relate this notion to their own
research questions and explanations.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
