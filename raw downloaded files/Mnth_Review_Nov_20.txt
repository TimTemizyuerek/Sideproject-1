Dear colleagues,
We would like to remind you about the upcoming dead-
lines for abstract submission and registration for the
First Italian Congress on Marine Evolution (Primo Con-
gresso Italiano di Evoluzione Marina), EVOLMAR2020.
The conference is organized by the Zoological Station
Anton Dohrn, Naples (SZN) and the Italian Society
for Evolutionary Biology (SIBE-ISEB), and will take
place in an entirely virtual format on the 23rd-25th of
November 2020.
The meeting will feature a combination of invited
keynotes, contributed talks and posters around 4 the-
matic areas: macroevolution, populations and species,
adaptation, biodiversity.
We strongly encourage participation by students and
junior researchers, who are invited to apply for a num-
ber of prizes and awards. There will also be a photo
contest with prizes for the best photos depicting aspects
of marine evolution.
Conference talks can be in English or Italian (English
strongly encouraged), posters have to be prepared in
English.
Deadline for abstract submission is October 4th, for
registration October 30th. In order to encourage partic-
ipation, and thanks to the support of many dedicated
sponsors, we have been able to keep the registration fee
to a minimum (only 10 euros).

Sophie is a multidisciplinary researcher intrigued by the
eects of pollution on marine environments and the
industries that rely on them. She uses analytical chem-

for plastics to be a vector for chemical pollution, and to
better understand the impacts of plastic pollution on
our marine environments.

Donana AvianEvolution
We are looking for candidates for a 4y PhD student con-
tract to be associated with the project \Chromosomal
inversions as a mechanism for sympatric dierentiation
in quails" (PID2019-108163GB-I00)
Recent genomic studies have shown that chromosomal
inversions may play an important role in adaptation,
diversication and speciation. Chromosomal inversions
protect co-adapted alleles from recombination with mal-
adaptive ones, resulting in combinations of traits that
are inherited together, as a single unit, called supergenes.
Although theoretical studies suggest that this may be
common across the tree of life, extensive genomic data
is still scarce for most non-model organisms and it is
not clear how often intra-population polymorphisms
could be due to genomic inversions. Preliminary data
from our research group suggests that one very large
chromosomal inversion may be aecting the genome of
common quails in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula
and that this could be associated with dierences in pig-
mentation, size and wing shape. The PhD student will
study if there is assortative mating between the types
that could lead to pre-zygotic isolation, and if there is
decreased survival of chromosomal heterozygotes (het-
erokaryotypes). Further, the student will investigate if
dierences in phenology or in migratory behavior could
contribute to a relative isolation of the chromosomal
types.
The PhD student will be part of the Conservation and
Evolutionary Genetics group at the Estaci on Biol ogica
de Do nana (http://www.consevol.org/) in Seville. The
members of this group use genomic tools and eld ecol-
ogy methods to study the origin and evolution of ver-
tebrate biodiversity at intra- and inter-specic levels,
studying species in Europe, Africa, America and Asia.
The group has an international spirit and the PhD stu-
dent will collaborate with researchers at the University
of Barcelona and at international institutions. The
project will involve the analysis of genomic data using
diverse bioinformatic approaches and eld surveys and
monitoring of quails. Consequently, expertise in theseareas will be valued. A Masters degree or equivalent is
required.

Durham Endosymbiosis
PhD Opportunity:
Summary: Endosymbiosis is recognised as a funda-
mental evolutionary innovation that underpins the ori-
gins of many unicellular and all multicellular lifeforms
(Chomicki et al., 2019). Understanding the biology of
such phenomena can shed light on key drivers of inter-
species cooperation and provide an important window
into early origins of cellular life on the planet. The PhD
student will link to a recently funded project to deploy
new tools: single cell genomics and transcriptomics, as
well as metabolomics; to explore a unique and poorly
understood endosymbiosis involving an emergent dis-
ease agent of major economic importance. Supported
by a world class supervisory team (Prof. Mike Barrett,
Dr. Martin Llewellyn, Wellcome Trust Centre for Inte-
grative Parasitology, Glasgow; Dr. Guillame Chimocki,
Life Sciences, Durham) and a range in international col-
laborators (Prof. John Archibald, Dalhousie University,
Canada; Dr. Neil Ruane, Marine Institute, Ireland),
the student will have the opportunity to develop skills
at the cutting edge of genomics and molecular biology,
undertake training at international centres of excellence
in parasitology and evolutionary biology in the UK and
North America, and engage in marine biological eld-
work on the west coast of Ireland and Scotland. Finally,
this project has strong links with aquaculture indus-
try via project partners Scottish Sea Farms (SSF, Dr.
Ralph Bickerdike) and the student will also get valuable
experience working alongside industry.
Secondary endosymbiosis: The phenomenon in which
eukaryotic organisms engulf other eukaryotes is termed
'secondary endosymbiosis'. Secondary endosymbiosis
underpins the evolution of many eukaryotic phototrophs
and is thought to have involved the engulfment of an
ancestral eukaryotic rhodophyte (Oborn k 2018). The
number of times this has occurred in evolutionary history
is a moot point. However, it is clear that rhodophyte-
origin plastids play a key role in their host cell's biology.November 1, 2020 EvolDir 11
In some cases, the symbiont has lost the ability to photo-
synthesize, which leaves them a relic non-photosynthetic
plastid in a secondarily heterotrophic cell. This is the
case for the apicomplexans, which include the causative
agents of toxoplasmosis and malaria. The basis of ongo-
ing metabolic dependency is not always clear, however
some conserved functions across plastids belonging to
dierent apicomplexan lineages include isoprenoid (IPP
and DMAPP), tetrapyrrole, and fatty acid biosynthesis
(Janou ^Akovec et al. 2015).
The study system: Paramoeba perurans causes amoebic
gill disease (AGD) and is a major pathogen in salmonid
aquaculture, causing 400 million in losses per annum
world-wide. There are currently no drugs available to
treat AGD. P. perurans has a unique cellular biology
that can be readily exploited given the right tools. En-
closed within its cytoplasm is a bizarre endosymbiont
- Perkinsela. Genomic sequence data suggest that the
basic physiology of this endosymbiont has many of the
same biochemical features as found in kinetoplastid
pathogens of man and domestic livestock (e.g. Sleeping
sickness, Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease).
The endosymbiosis between P. perurans and Perkinsela
is unique among eukaryotes because it does not involve
an originally photosynthetic symbiont. Prior investiga-
tions have established interdependence between the kine-
toplasitid and amoeba based on predicted gene content
and ontogeny in the related Parameoba pemaquidensis
(Tanifuji et al. 2017).
This studentship has three major aims:
Aim 1: Understand the molecular basis of the obligate
dependence between P. perurans and Perkinsela. The
student will use genome sequencing (long read tech-
nologies jointly with illumina short reads for polishing),
single-cell transcriptomics as well as metabolomics to
dissect the molecular basis of the symbiosis. Specic
drug knock outs jointly with transcriptomic analysis
will allow to functionally test metabolic dependences.
Aim 2: Undertake rational Amoebic gill disease (AGD)
drug discovery. A detailed understanding of depen-
dences in the between P. perurans and Perkinsela sym-
biosis will provide a window to test drugs ecient on
AGD. In collaboration with the Wellcome Trust Cen-
tre for Intergrative Parasitology, the student will test
drugs targeting metabolic dependences of P. perurans.
Ultimately trials will be performed in sh farms with
SSF.
Aim 3: Trace the evolution of this unique endosymbiosis.
Using a recent approach (Kwong et al., 2019), we will
reconstruct the phylogenetic histories of both the host
P. perurans and the Perkinsela symbiont clades, relyingon a range of archival environmental samples as well as
new marine collections. Using targeted sequence enrich-
ment, we will sequence the genomic regions of the host
identied as driving the obligate dependence (Aim 1),
and analyses of substitution rates (dn/ds) will inform
of their

PHD OPPORTUNITY Sustainable palm agriculture
and biodiversity in Africa: from genomics to economics
Supervisors: Professor Vincent Savolainen
(v.savolainen@imperial.ac.uk) https://-
www.imperial.ac.uk/people/v.savolainen; Dr C
M (Tilly) Collins, Centre for Environmental Policy
Department: Department of Life Sciences, Imperial Col-
lege London Palm agriculture has received criticism
due to its link with deforestation, especially in Asia.
Savolainen and Collins (supervisors), together with 16
partners across Africa propose that there is an opportu-November 1, 2020 EvolDir 13
nity for sustainable palm futures on the continent (Curr.
Res. Environ. Sust. 1:31-34, 2020). Applying inter-
disciplinary systems thinking and circular production
models, food and economic security can be achieved sus-
tainably by (i) increasing resilience and productivity of
crop palms in the harsh tropical climates of sub-Saharan
Africa; (ii) promoting integrated production of nutri-
tionally valuable insect and fungal protein using palm
crop waste; and (iii) promoting the development of palm
plantations as biodiverse agroforestry ecosystems.
This PhD project will address components of these ideas
and will align with a major collaboration grant to super-
visor Savolainen in partnership with the Marc Delorme
Coconut Research Station (MDCRS), the world's largest
collection of Coconut palm ecotypes and varieties, lo-
cated in Cote d'Ivoire. This grant addresses (i) above,
has a focus on disentangling the genetic architecture
underpinning drought tolerance in Coconut palms and
is linked to previous work by supervisor Savolainen who
identied genes for stress tolerance in Australian island
Howea palms. The established partnership with MD-
CRS now provides substantial opportunity for work to
expand our understanding of (ii) and (iii).
The PhD proposal here is to use the yield-focussed,
experimental planting arrays (variation in genetic back-
ground, management regime, plant spacing) already held
by the MDCRS to explore the eects of these variables
on plantation biodiversity.
The student will design and conduct above-ground (ora
& arthropod) and soil (metagenomics with a focus on
mycorrhizae) biodiversity surveys and thus evaluate
these alternative plantation models from a dierent per-
spective, that of intrinsic diversity and its contribution
to resilience. This will underpin impactful advice for
both intercrop diversity and natural vegetation diversity
in palm plantation systems (e.g. Savolainen showed that
soil microbes were key to adaptation and coexistence of
Howea palms).
This will link to development of a model of circular
economy for Coconut palms, quantifying the benets
of intercropping and insect and fungal farming from
Coconut waste. These latter generate protein and soil
conditioning co-products which support local enterprise
and economy. This repurposing of 'waste' builds on pre-
vious work by co-supervisor Collins and we anticipate
to support model parametrisation through MSc project
work locally.
The student will thus contribute to a roadmap towards
a sustainable palm future and create opportunity to
improve palm farming in Africa by explicit inclusion
of biodiversity and human benets to this cropping cy-
cle. This adds to economic and social gain and reducesenvironmental destruction while enhancing gross land
productivity.

Project summary Understanding the extent of local
adaptation in natural populations and the mechanisms
enabling individuals to adapt to their native environ-
ment is a major avenue in evolutionary ecology research.
Host-pathogen coevolution is widely seen as a major14 EvolDir November 1, 2020
driver of local adaptation and has therefore been a
study model to dissect the evolutionary processes at
work during local adaptation. However, the relative
contributions of species interactions (i.e. biotic factor)
and abiotic factors to local adaptation are still unclear.
Addressing these issues is more than a simple academic
exercise. Understanding of local adaptation processes in
host-parasite interactions will also help tackling pressing
issues, such as the ways in which environmental change
alters the emergence of pathogens leading to host extinc-
tions, how to promote sustainability of agroecosystems
in the face of emerging crop diseases or in guiding for
public health practices as more human pathogens and
their vectors expand their ranges.
In this project, we investigate whether local adaptation
occurred during the recent rapid colonization of culti-
vated apple by Dysaphis plantaginea, the major aphid
pest of cultivated apple orchards, in Europe. We will
carry out in April 2020 experimental tests for D. plan-
taginea tness dierences across environments (i.e. host
and climate) to investigate whether the aphid is locally
adapted to its host and/or climate. This project will
generate original results adding to our understanding
of how species interactions and abiotic conditions can
shape local adaptation.
Master project The project involves the transplant of
Belgian, French and Spanish aphid genotypes on Belgian,
French and Spanish apple varieties in three locations
(Belgian, France and Spain). The candidate will be
involved in the assessment of the adaptive capacities
at the ecological level of the rosy apple aphid at the
SPAIN site located at SERIDA (Villaviciosa, Spain).
The project can last two (Bachelor) to three months
(Master), and will consist in participating in aphid in-
festations and rearing on the eld, tree measurement,
associated statistical analyses, and nal report writing.
1) The candidate will participate in the launching of the
experiment there during Spring 2021 by transplanting
aphids on several apple cultivars and will measure sev-
eral phenotypic traits. The growth rate of each colony
will be measured after 12 days of infestation. Various
functional traits which are proxies of the condition of
the plant (i.e. chlorophyll content, carbon/nitrogen bal-
ance, and avonol and anthocyanin content measured
with the Dualex?? pincel) will also be measured.
2) If wanted, He/She will analyze the dataset that will
be generated.
Methodology: Statistical analyses (linear and mixed
models, R), ecophysiology, phenotypic measurement,
rearing, insect biology, eld experiment.
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-date will have skills in ecology and evolution or at least
will show strong interest in these elds. He/She will
have to be highly motivated about eld experiment, as
this one will be intense the rst two months. He/she will
not necessarily be familiar with apple or aphid model.

ment is a major avenue in evolutionary ecology research.
Host-pathogen coevolution is widely seen as a majorNovember 1, 2020 EvolDir 15
driver of local adaptation and has therefore been a
study model to dissect the evolutionary processes at
work during local adaptation. However, the relative
contributions of species interactions (i.e. biotic factor)
and abiotic factors to local adaptation are still unclear.
Addressing these issues is more than a simple academic
exercise. Understanding of local adaptation processes in
host-parasite interactions will also help tackling pressing
issues, such as the ways in which environmental change
alters the emergence of pathogens leading to host extinc-
tions, how to promote sustainability of agroecosystems
in the face of emerging crop diseases or in guiding for
public health practices as more human pathogens and
their vectors expand their ranges.
In this project, we investigate whether local adaptation
occurred during the recent rapid colonization of culti-
vated apple by Dysaphis plantaginea, the major aphid
pest of cultivated apple orchards, in Europe. We will
carry out in April 2020 experimental tests for D. plan-
taginea tness dierences across environments (i.e. host
and climate) to investigate whether the aphid is locally
adapted to its host and/or climate. This project will
generate original results adding to our understanding
of how species interactions and abiotic conditions can
shape local adaptation.
Master project The project involves the transplant of
Belgian, French and Spanish aphid genotypes on Belgian,
French and Spanish apple varieties in three locations
(Belgian, France and Spain). The candidate will be in-
volved in the assessment of the adaptive capacities at the
ecological level of the rosy apple aphid at the BELGIAN
site located at PCFruit (Sint-Truiden, Belgium). The
project can last four (Bachelor) to six months (Master),
and will consist in participating in aphid infestations
and rearing on the eld, tree measurement, associated
statistical analyses, and nal report writing.
1) The candidate will lead the launching of the experi-
ment there during Spring 2021 by transplanting aphids
on several apple cultivars and will measure several phe-
notypic traits. The growth rate of each colony will be
measured after 12 days of infestation. Various functional
traits which are proxies of the condition of the plant
(i.e. chlorophyll content, carbon/nitrogen balance, and
avonol and anthocyanin content measured with the
Dualex ?? pincel) will also be measured.
2) If wanted, He/She will analyze the dataset that will
be generated.
Methodology: Statistical analyses (linear and mixed
models, R), ecophysiology, phenotypic measurement,
rearing, insect biology, eld experiment.
Prole preferred for the candidate: Ideally, the candi-date will have skills in ecology and evolution or at least
will show strong interest in these elds. He/She will
have to be highly motivated about eld experiment, as
this one will be intense the rst two months. He/she will
not necessarily be familiar with apple or aphid model.
Deadline for submission: Mid-november.

JagiellonianU ThermalAdaptation
We are seeking for a PhD student for a project: When
temperature makes them to panic? - the eect of opti-
mal vs. stressful thermal conditions on the repeatability
of the performance tests in ectotherms
to be realized in the Institute of Environmental Sci-
ences, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland (http:/-
/www.eko.uj.edu.pl/en GB/ ).
Principal Investigator: Aleksandra Walczy nska aleksan-
dra.walczynska@uj.edu.pl
Financial conditions: A National Science Centre stipend
(4000 PLN/month gross) is available for one student
for 2 years, followed by 2 years of the stipend oered
through the regular PhD program of the Jagiellonian
University.
Requirements:
1) Formal conditions:
* MSc degree in a relevant eld of life science, such as
biology, biotechnology, biological sciences, achieved by16 EvolDir November 1, 2020
the time of enrollment.
* Admission to the \PhD Biology program" in the PhD
School at Jagiellonian University, eective on 3.11.2020
(https://science.phd.uj.edu.pl/).
2) Specic merit requirements for the project include:
* strong English language; * experience with the lab-
oratory studies in ecology or physiology; * experience
with data processing and statistical analyses; * scien-
tic achievements such as publications or attendance in
conferences are considered advantageous.
Scope of work: The PhD student will be involved in a
three-stage study in which the mechanisms of response
to optimal and stressful thermo-oxygenic conditions will
be examined at the organismal and mitochondrial lev-
els. The study will be conducted in the Institute of
Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian University, with
Lecane inermis rotifer as a model organism. The project
includes a three-month visit of a PhD student at the Uni-
versity of Rostock where a student will get acquainted
with the cutting-edge methodology of assessing the mito-
chondrial eciency under stress, supervised by Professor
Inna Sokolova.
The research description: The study focuses on the
mechanisms and the evolutionary causes of existence
of the temperature-size rule (TSR). According to this
very common rule in nature, organisms grow smaller
at higher (more favorable) temperature, than in lower
(less favorable) temperature. This pattern is puzzling
from the evolutionary point of view, because one should
expect that in more favorable conditions organisms will
grow larger to have more progeny. Unless there is an-
other, accompanying factor, driving the TSR. Currently,
it is suggested that the most promising candidate for
this factor is oxygen availability. It naturally decreases
with increasing temperature, lowering the eciency of
oxygen transport into the mitochondria. Body size is
supposed to be a simple consequence of decreasing of
cell size; the simplest solution enhancing this eective-
ness. We will look for the repeated patterns of response,
as those of adaptive signicance, in opposition to re-
sponse variable among individuals, informing about the
mismatch between stressful conditions and organismal
response to them.
The formal application should be sent to aleksan-
dra.walczynska@uj.edu.pl by 24 October 2020 and
should include: 1) A scan of MSc diploma in biology,
biotechnology or other relevant; 2) A reference letter

MichiganStateU FishEvoDevoGeno
PhD Positions in Fish Evolutionary Developmental Ge-
nomics The Fish Evo Devo Geno Lab (PI: Ingo Braasch)
at Michigan State University is recruiting highly moti-
vated PhD students interested in working on the genomic
basis of vertebrate evolution and development to start
in Summer/Fall 2021.
The Braasch Lab focuses on genomic and developmental
changes that contribute to major transitions during the
course of vertebrate evolution and studies evolutionary
novelties at the levels of genome structure, gene family
evolution, and gene regulation. We combine sequencing
and comparative analyses of sh genomes with analy-
ses of molecular evolution and functional genetic and
developmental approaches (CRISPR genome editing,
transgenics, gene expression analyses, epigenomic pro-
ling) in a variety of model species (zebrash, spotted
gar, medaka, killish, and others). Graduate projectsfall within the following broader research areas of the
group: 1. Genomic and morphological evolution of shes:
How do morphological dierences among sh and other
vertebrate lineages arise from diversication of gene
repertoires? What is the role of gen(om)e duplications
and gene losses in generating phenotypic diversity? How
do changes in gene regulation contribute to evolutionary
novelties and key innovations? We study a number of
gene families that are of particular importance for the
evolution of the vertebrate body plan, e. g. genes in-
volved in development of the vertebrate-specic neural
crest cells.
2. Conquest of land and 'sh-out-of-water': We are
studying genomic changes and their functional conse-
quences leading to the evolution of tetrapods from shes
and other 'sh-out-of-water' scenarios, including the evo-
lutionary loss of genes at the water-to-land transition
and the gene regulatory basis of hatching. 3. Evolution-
ary genomic analyses of zebrash and other biomedical
sh models: Combining genomic sequence comparisons,
gene expression analyses and epigenomic proling, we
aim to improve connectivity of teleost biomedical sh
models such as zebrash, medaka, killishes, etc. to
human biology and disease.
We are highly committed to diversity and equity and to
foster an inclusive and accessible work environment.
Qualications: Applicants should hold a bachelor's de-
gree in biology, genetics, genomics, molecular biology,
bioinformatics, developmental biology, zoology or re-
lated elds. Suitable candidates should be enthusiastic
about working in an interdisciplinary manner and have
a passion for sh/vertebrate biology and evolution. Pre-
vious research experience in a relevant area is desired,
but not required.
Admission: Students will be admitted through the MSU
IBIO Graduate Program and the MSU Ecology, Evolu-
tion, and Behavior (EEB) Program. Another possible
route of admission is through the MSU Genetics and
Genome Sciences Graduate Program within the MSU
BioMolecular Science Gateway.
Application deadlines for the MSU IBIO and Genetics
Graduate Programs are December 1, 2020. Note that
GRE scores are not required for application.
Funding: Financial support is provided through research
and teaching assistantships and the PI's external fund-
ing from NSF and NIH. Competitive applicants will
be eligible for university fellowships and supported in
applying for graduate fellowships from NSF, NIH, and
other agencies.

PhD studentship: Protamines - Evolution and role in
sperm formation and function. Location: National Mu-
seum of Natural Sciences, Spanish Research Council

A 4-year PhD studentship position is available to join
the group led by Eduardo Roldan at the Reproductive
Biology and Evolution Group, of the Spanish National
Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid, to work in the
project \Protamines: Evolution and role in the pro-
tection of sperm DNA, sperm head shaping and cell
performance" (ref. PID2019-108649GB-I00).
The student will participate in an eort aimed at in-
vestigating the role of protamines in sperm formation
and function. Protamines protect DNA from damage,
silence genes, participate in paternal imprinting, carry
epigenetic information and, by condensing chromatin,
inuence sperm head shape and overall sperm hydrody-
namic eciency and, in turn, sperm motion. Defects in
protamine function associate with sperm abnormalities,
fertilization failure, embryonic death and onset of genetic
disease in ospring. We are interested in protamine evo-
lution and how chromatin compaction inuences sperm
head formation during spermiogenesis. An in vitro sys-
tem of somatic cells expressing protamines will be used
to understand nuclear remodelling and shaping. By
using sperm sorting systems, based on microuidics and
response to chemoattractants, relationships between per-
formance, head shape and sperm DNA compaction by
protamines will be examined. Results will allow us to
gain a thorough and deeper understanding of factors de-
termining sperm structure and function that are crucial
for male fertility.
The project will be developed in collaboration with
groups at the University of Bonn, Virginia Common-
wealth University (Richmond, VA), Universit ^A^A di Ter-
amo and Universidad Maim ^A^Anides (Buenos Aires) so
opportunities exist for international travel and exchange.
Requirements: -Any nationality. -Graduate in Biomedi-

be mandatory by day of appointment. -An academic
record above 7.0 (scale 0-10) is desirable. -Experience

Nearly all human genes undergo alternative splicing, the

function of alternatively spliced transcripts. We know
it^A^As a universal phenomenon in eukaryotes, regulation
of splicing is tissue and developmental stage-specic,
and it plays an important part in fundamental biologi-

ClimateAdaptation
PhD student positions in the ecological genomics of
adaptation to climate change and ecological speciation.
The Powell Lab (www.powellevolab.com) at Bingham-
ton University (SUNY) is focused on understanding how
ecological processes, physiological systems, genetic vari-
ation, and genome structure interact during adaptation
to novel niches and changing environments. The lab is
currently seeking 1-2 PhD students to begin in the Fall
of 2021. Graduate students in my lab have opportunities
to address these questions from a range of approaches,
from eld work and physiological assays to transcrip-
tomics and population genomics, and I am specically
looking for students who are interested in engaging in
integrative work, combining approaches across levels of
biological organization. Work in the lab spans a num-
ber of study systems including: the classic ecological
speciation system of the apple maggot y, Rhagoletis
pomonella, and the adaptation radiation of its broader
species complex, gall formers and their associated par-
asitoids, and a species complex of ants in the genus
Aphaenogaster. Major themes of our current research
program include understanding how standing genetic
variation that allows for rapid evolutionary responses
to environmental change and incipient speciation in re-
sponse to novel niches is maintained in species across
latitude, elevation, and heterogeneous biotic interactions
as well as experimental approaches to identifying risk
of maladaptive responses to climate change in insect
communities.
We are seeking highly motivated students interested in
the ecological genetics and evolutionary ecology of theorigin and maintenance of biodiversity. Students with
a BS or MS in Biology (or other relevant disciplines),
with research experience and a solid background in labo-
ratory bench work, who are comfortable with eld work,
have proven writing and communication skills, and who
are self-motivated and independent will be the most
competitive. Other desirable qualications include a
strong grasp on statistics, experience in computational
methods, or strong background in insect biology.
Binghamton University is the top-ranked institution in
the SUNY system and is consistently rated as one of
the premier public universities in the Northeast. Our
campus is located in the Southern Tier of New York,
between the Catskills and Finger Lakes, about a 3 hour
drive from NYC. The region features abundant oppor-
tunities for outdoor recreation and a very reasonable
cost of living. Our setting on the Allegheny Plateau
isn't just aesthetically pleasant, it also happens to be an
excellent geographic location for our lab's study systems.

approaches to address consequential ecological questions.
In this the project we will apply an ecogenomic approach,
by analysis of genome diversity and gene expression, as-
sessing the association of genetic variants to population
cycling or intermediate phenotypes of rock ptarmigan.
Within the frame of the recently completed comprehen-
sive project, \Rock ptarmigan health and population
change" spanning the years 2006-2018, a unique tissue
and dataset have been created by the annual collection
from this wild bird population. We aim to explore the
impact of trophic interactions such as diversity of the
gut microbial community, plant-herbivore interactions,
and role of toxins. The health parameters and tissue
collection of Icelandic rock ptarmigan are unique with
no such comparable dataset available elsewhere The
ecogenomic approach will involve generating genomes,transcriptomes, and miRNAomes from the rock ptarmi-
gan followed by comparative genomics and tissue-specic
expression analysis with the goal to map and character-
ize genomic regions involved in selection/adaption and
to examine how genes are involved in various biological
processes such as abiotic and biotic stress responses.
The main supervisor of the Ph.D. student is Pro-
fessor Kristinn P etur Magn ~Aosson at the Faculty of
Natural Resource Sciences, University of Akureyri
(UNAK,www.unak.is), and Icelandic Institute of Natu-

ulation genetics, or molecular genetics. The applicant
will furthermore have a genuine, interest in science, as
well as a willingness to learn new methods of research
and excellent interpersonal and collaborative skills. Doc-
umented reading, writing, and communication skills in
English are an absolute must.
The application deadline is Ocober 20th, 2020. The
applicant should be able to commence employment in

Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) in cold-adapted diatoms -
implications for survival under freezing temperatures
MOCK U21DTP
PhD Position at the UEA: Applications are invited for
a PhD candidate to join the group of Thomas Mock
(Marine Microbiology, University of East Anglia) in a
collaborative project with Cock van Oosterhout (Evolu-
tionary Genetics, University of East Anglia) to conduct
research on an UKRI-BBSRC funded project studying
a ubiquitous family of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that
helps cold-adapted organisms to survive at extreme low
temperatures.
Background:
The ocean harbours the largest untapped resource for
novel products used in biotechnology, agriculture and
medicine. Many valuable products with great potential
have been isolated from cold-adapted marine microbes
as they occupy extreme environments, which require pro-
teins to function at low temperatures. The ubiquitous
family of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) helps cold-adapted
organisms to survive at lower temperatures by reduc-
ing ice-crystal formation, and in case of microbes by
reshaping their icy surroundings. Potential applications
include controlling ice-crystal formation in food, grow-
ing frost-resistant crops and improving preservation of
cells and tissues for medical applications. However, as
IBPs are diverse, the function of dierent isoforms needs
to be determined, which will dene their applications
in biotechnology.
PhD studentship:
This PhD studentship will determine the function of
representative IBPs in the cold-adapted model diatom-
Fragilariopsis cylindrusthrough reverse genetics and bio-
chemical characterisation. The genome of this prolic
diatom encodes several IBP genes, which are dieren-
tially expressed, and preliminary data based on targetingsignals imply that their proteins are localised in dier-
ent parts of the cell, which suggests that they perform
dierent roles. The student will uorescently tag IBPs
for their subcellular localisation and assess their eects
on growth and ice-structure. Furthermore, genome edit-
ing will be used to remove IBP genes from the genome
ofF. cylindrusfor their characterisation through loss of
function. Thus, data from this project will lay the
foundation for a biotechnology platform to characterise
cold-adapted proteins for providing new insights into
the biology of polar organisms and to test and produce
novel cold-adapted proteins.
The ideal candidate:
Candidates for academic admission to a doctoral de-
gree at UEA and for entry to the Norwich Research
Park Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NR-
PDTP) programme must have obtained (or be about
to obtain), a First or Upper Second-class UK Honours
degree in evolution, genetics, biotechnology, or a related
eld. Students with qualications gained outside the
UK that are considered to be equivalent are eligible as
well. Applicants with a Lower Second-class degree will
be considered if they also have a Masters degree, or have
signicant research or non-academic experience relevant
to the proposed eld of research. Studentships awarded
based on predicted grades will be conditional upon nal
results.
Funding:
The NRPDTP funding is provided by UKRI-BBSRC
and its Partners and supports, for a maximum of 4 years,
to successful eligible candidates:
- UEA tuition fees paid directly to the University
- A student stipend to cover living expenses for each year

Evidence is accumulating that a father's condition can
be transferred non-genetically to the next generation and
aect ospring development, performance and health.
To date, the mechanisms underlying such paternal con-
dition transfer eects remain poorly understood and
their evolutionary consequences are largely unexplored.
In this project you will use a Japanese quail (Coturnix
japonica) model system, in which paternal condition
transfer eects on ospring reproductive performance
have previously been demonstrated, to identify the ori-
gin, function and evolutionary consequences of non-
genetic paternal eects using a highly multidisciplinary
and integrative approach.
Using in vivo experiments combined with state-of-the-
art -omics techniques you will test how favourable or
harsh early life conditions experienced by males aect
their sperm and seminal uid composition, and how
dierent components of the male's ejaculate mediate
inter-generational eects on the daughters' reproductive
performance and health.
Experimental in vivo and molecular work will be com-
plemented by evolutionary modelling to quantify the
role of paternal condition-transfer eects in altering the
response to selection, as well as the potential of experi-
mental interventions to modify evolutionary trajectories
of reproductive traits under selection through paternal
eects.
The project will provide fundamental novel insights into
the mechanisms underlying paternal condition transfer
eects across generations and the potential of early life
interventions to alter evolutionary trajectories, both
directly relevant to the management of animal health
and performance as well as our understanding of the
reproductive lives of birds.
The studentship is funded for 4 years. During the

https://panorama-dtp.ac.uk/how-to-apply/ Funding:
UK (NERC, Competition-funded)
A fully funded PhD position is now open for applications
at the Universities of Hull and Leeds, UK, via NERC's
Panorama Doctoral Tranining Partnership programme.
Bees, our foremost pollinators, are vital for ecosystem
stability and global food security 'V providing polli-
nation services worth hundreds of billions of pounds
annually. The UK is home to ~245 species of wild
bees which collectively perform more pollination than
managed honeybees and bumblebees. Unfortunately,
wild bee populations are declining, under pressure from
multiple causes 'V one key factor being nutrition.
All bees feed ospring with pollen gathered from the
landscape. But human inuences such as agricultural
intensication are altering nutritional landscapes for
bees [3,4], and fundamentally aecting gene expression,
growth and reproduction. Most of what we know about
bee nutrition comes from studies in social bees like hon-
eybees or bumblebees [5,6], where nutrition inuences
caste determination, development, pathogen resistance
and others. However, the nutritional ecology of other
bees, particularly solitary bees, is largely unstudied.
Human activity is also changing climates and raising
average temperatures. Temperature aects animals' ^A
metabolic rate, physiology, digestion, and nutrient as-
similation, as well as gene expression. Dr Gilbert' ^As
recent work [7] has identied the need to store enough
carbohydrate and fat to survive the winter as potentially
critical for solitary bees' ^A nutritional ecology. But we
know little about how this is regulated, how climatechange will aect bees, and how bees will deal with
changing nutritional landscapes in a future lled with
uncertainty.
We are now, for the rst time, in a position to under-
stand not just whether but also how dierent nutritional
landscapes and climates aect bees. This exciting cross-
institutional project combines eld ecology with cutting
edge molecular approaches to address a crucial knowl-
edge gap about how bees are being aected by human-
altered nutritional landscapes. This project addresses
issues relevant for pure ecological science, conservation
biology, agriculture and crop science.
At Hull, Dr Gilbert' ^As lab has pioneered rearing pro-
tocols for the economically and ecologically important
solitary bee, Osmia bicornis. This work is providing an
unprecedented window onto bee nutritional ecology. At
Leeds, Dr Duncan' ^As lab uses a variety of cutting-edge
molecular tools to understand how bees are inuenced
by their environment. Dr Duncan has conducted ground-
breaking work on how nutrition aects gene expression
in developing bees, as well as recent work on the en-
vironmental and molecular control of reproduction in
O. bicornis. The student will capitalise on this timely
opportunity to synthesize the research interests of these
two research groups and create collaborative links be-
tween institutions. The candidate will be integrated into
both lab groups and will benet from the infrastructure
and connections at both universities.
Using careful manipulations within controlled labora-
tory environments, the student will rst establish how
dietary macronutrients aect the tness of solitary bee
larvae in response to changes in rearing temperature.
Then, they will use high-throughput sequencing tech-
nology to examine genome-wide expression proles of
larvae receiving dierent diet and temperature treat-
ments, to understand the molecular and physiological
mechanisms underlying bees' ^A responses to landscape
and climate change. Nutritional cues are known to alter
gene expression [8], but to date studies have focussed
largely on a few genes, and only in honeybees. The
student will compare larvae receiving dierent treat-
ments in (1) choices larvae make about which nutrients
to consume, (2) correlates of tness such as body size
and overwinter survival, and (3) expression of growth-
versus diapause-related genes.
Outcomes: The ndings will, rstly, shed light on the
optimal nutrition for bees 'V both currently, and in a
warmer future. They will help inform active measures
such as wildower strips to conserve and promote these
vital pollinators as the climate changes. Secondly, re-
sults will also show the physiological eects of dierent

Ph.D. Positions in Comparative Genomics
The Jones Lab at the University of Idaho is recruiting
at least two Ph.D. students to study the comparative
genomics of seahorses, pipeshes and seadragons (to
start Fall 2021). The students will participate in two
major NSF-funded research initiatives. The rst is to
use comparative genomics and population genomics to
investigate genome-level eects of sexual selection. The
second is to investigate the evolutionary developmental
biology of the male's brood pouch and how its evolu-
tion shapes the male-pregnancy microbiome. This latter
project is a collaboration between the Jones Lab and the
Cresko Lab at the University of Oregon. Both projects
will involve international eld work, molecular bench
work, and bioinformatics.
The University of Idaho is particularly strong in evo-
lutionary biology and bioinformatics. In addition, it
is located less than ten miles from Washington State
University, which is home to another excellent group of
evolutionary biologists. Scientists from the two univer-
sities collaborate and interact extensively.
The University of Idaho is located in Moscow, Idaho,
which is a small college town situated in the Palouse
region of Washington and Idaho. Moscow is known for
its quaint downtown and its summer farmer's market.
Thanks to its compact size, everything in Moscow is
within walking or biking distance. In addition, Moscow's
location on the Idaho-Washington border puts it within
easy reach of abundant outdoor recreational opportuni-

to the next can be tracked. Further, the opportunity for
manipulative experiments is provided (e.g., provisioning
of selected microbes to assess probiotic eects, eect of
additional stressor, etc.). The project aims to measure
genotype/allele frequencies using whole genome pool se-

PredatorPreyCoevolution
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic
PhD student to work on predator-prey coevolution in
microbial communities.|
Project Description: Reciprocal evolutionary changes
of interacting species are major drivers for diversica-
tion and speciation and have mainly been studied in
host-parasite systems and for mutualistic interactions.
Although predator-prey interactions are commonplace
and characterized by strong selection from both sides,
predator-prey coevolution and its consequences on di-
versication are less well understood. In this project
we plan to combine a long-term experimental evolution
study of dierent microbial predator-prey systems with
whole genome sequencing over time. The experimental
design allows us to compare evolutionary changes within
replicates of the same species as well as across species,
giving us the opportunity to assess the repeatability
of evolutionary change in terms of phenotypic changes,
mutations arsing and their trajectories. We further aimto study how the coevolutionary past of predator and
prey (changed baseline) determines the resilience of the
predator-prey interaction to disturbances. This project
is in collaboration with colleagues form the University
Turku (Teppo Hiltunen) and Helsinki (Johannes Cairns,
Ville Mustonen) and some of the experimental work will
be done at the University of Turku.
Highly motivated candidates with a master's degree in
microbiology, evolutionary biology or ecology are wel-
come to apply. Applicants should have a background in
evolutionary theory or population dynamics and show
an enthusiasm for basic research and ideally experience
in working with microbial systems. The successful can-
didate should be able to communicate eectively with
individuals from a wide range of disciplines.
Location: The Aquatic Ecology and Evolution group
is part of the Limnological Institute at the University
Konstanz. The collaborative research environment in
the lab is highly integrative, international, and oper-
ates in English. Therefore, the ability to speak German
would be a plus, but is not essential. Further infor-
mation on researchers and research in the Becks lab
can be obtained here: |https://www.limnologie.uni-
konstanz.de/en/ag-becks/ or by contacting Lutz Becks
(lutz.becks@uni-konstanz.de).

Andy Rominger <ajrominger@gmail.com >UMunich EvolutionaryEpigenetics
A PhD position investigating the relevance of epigenetic
variation in natural populations to evolution is available
in the research group of Jochen Wolf at Munich Uni-
versity, Germany This project is part of a collaborative
eort involving several avian research groups in Europe.
Background
Since the merger of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian
hereditary principles at the onset of the 20th century,
genetic variation has been at the core of evolutionary
research. Genome-wide scrutiny of genetic variation
segregating in natural populations has provided funda-
mental insights into the evolutionary processes under-
lying adaptation and speciation. Yet, calls for incorpo-
rating epigenetic modications of the DNA blueprint
into an extended evolutionary synthesis have repeatedly
been made. And indeed, epigenetic variation consti-
tutes an important modier of phenotypic variation and
may promote plastic responses allowing populations to
explore novel niche space. Evolutionary relevance of
epigenetic modication, however, will depend on the re-
lationship between environmental inducibility and trans-
generational stability independent of the underlying
genetic variation. Comprehensive data on both of these
aspects are scarce.
The Project
The research program run by the successful candidate
proposes to ll this knowledge gap using a broad geo-
graphic sampling regime of several thousand individu-
als from pedigree-informed natural populations of two
avian species as a model: the great tit, Parus major,
and the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus. Specically, we
will use this setup to characterize the intrinsic and exter-
nal forces shaping diversity in 5mC DNA methylation
across various scales of integration. First, we will quan-
tify the inheritance patterns of these epigenetic marks
within families (broods) leveraging additional power
from extra pair young. Second, we will determine the
extent of population-level epigenetic variability across
diverse environments. Third, by adding populations
of the European crow, Corvus (corone) spp. there is
the additional possibility of assessing the degree of ge-
netic and epigenetic divergence across 44 million years
of evolution.
Qualications The successful applicant holds a mas-November 1, 2020 EvolDir 37
ter degree in a relevant subject and is skilled in bioin-
formatic analyses with large genome-wide data sets.
Previous experience with epigenetic work, quantitative
genetics and/or statistical modelling (e.g. linear mixed
models) is a clear asset.
Research environment of the host lab The Wolf lab
applies an integrative approach to explore micro-
evolutionary processes and genetic mechanisms underly-
ing species divergence, adaptation and genome evolution
(1, 2). Using large-scale genomic approaches combined
with eld based experiments, we characterize genetic
diversity within and between populations and assess
its relationship to phenotypic divergence (3-6) - some-
times interpreting the data under a conservation angle
(7, 8). In addition, we explore methodological aspects
of data analyses (9, 10) and engage in comparative ap-
proaches to study evolution across larger timescales (11,
12). Empirical systems currently include natural pop-
ulations of birds (swallows, cuckoos and corvids (4-6,
13, 14)), marine mammals (pinnipeds and killer whales)
(15, 16) and recently added ssion yeast (17, 18). More
information on the research activities in the lab can be
found at http://www.evol.bio.lmu.de/research/j wolf/-
index.html . The University of Munich is consistently
ranked among the top Universities worldwide, in par-
ticular the life science branch with its newly inaugu-
rated campus oering excellent technical facilities and
many interaction possibilities including the gene cen-
ter, several Max-Planck-Institutes and the Helmholtz
Centre (http://www.campusmartinsried.de/en/336-2/-
#). With the highest concentration of supercomputing
in Germany the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre and
its local partners provide access to state-of-the art com-
puting facilities (https://www.lrz.de/english/). Munich,
Bavaria's capital, is a vibrant, yet relaxed city with
many traditions still alive, a high quality of living and
the Alps nearby.
How to apply Applications including a CV, a state-
ment of motivation and the contact details of at least
two references in a single .pdf should be sent to evolu-
tion@bio.lmu.de with subject header 'epigenetic posi-
tion'. The position remains open until lled, starting

PhD position in Plant Evolutionary Biology, University

RESEARCH PROJECT: The relative contribution of
genetic and epigenetic variability to adaptation.
Genetic variation in form of de novo mutations or stand-
ing genetic variation is the major source of variation
in complex traits that can enable adaptation through
the process of selection. This is a fundamental tenet
of the modern evolutionary synthesis that combines
Darwin`s ideas with that of Mendelian genetics. Never-
theless, in recent years, the assumption that only the
genetic code can contribute to inheritance of biolog-
ical traits has been challenged with the discovery of
trans-generational epigenetic inheritance. Phenotypes
induced by environmental factors can be passed on over
multiple generations owing to relatively stable, long
terms changes in gene expression. It is known that some
types of epigenetic marks behave like genetic mutations
(epimutations), they are variable in natural populations,
and are heritable to the next generation with consid-
erable inuence on the phenotype. Owing to these
reasons, it has been put forward that epigenetic vari-
ation may have the ability to inuence the heritable
variation of complex traits and thus can potentially
contribute to adaptation. Nevertheless, the respective
role of epigenetic and genetic variation in the process
of adaptation is presently not well understood. Fur-
thermore, the relative and quantitative contribution of
epigenetic and genetic variability to adaptive processes
is not known. In this project we will use plant model
systems (the moss Physcomitrella patens and the liver-
wort Marchantia polymorpha) in experimental evolution
experiments coupled with high-throughput sequencing
to address this fundamental issue in detail. During
the experimental evolution experiments, we will record
and quantify phenotypic changes and their overall rel-
ative contribution to adaptation in epigenetically and
genetically diverse populations. We will also carry out
whole-genome bisulte sequencing, gene expression pro-
ling, and DNA re-sequencing experiments on a subsetof individuals to investigate the genomic basis of pheno-
typic change. Finally, we will test the stability of the
acquired phenotypic traits. This research will be carried
out in a collaboration between two groups of the URPP
\Evolution in Action" by combining their complemen-
tary expertise on the model system and experimental
evolution.
This project is founded by the University of Zurich`s
Research Priority Program (URPP) \Evolution in Ac-
tion: from Genomes to Ecosystems" to Peter Szovenyi
and Ueli Grossniklaus (https://www.evolution.uzh.ch/-

organization bringing together evolutionary research
across many departments and topics ranging from lin-
guistics to molecular biology. It consists of professors,
PhD students, and postdoctoral fellows with the goal
to facilitate interdisciplinary research and create new
ideas. The PhD position is fully funded for four years
including retreats, courses, and bioinformatics support
by the URPP.
The Dept. of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany hosts
research groups working on the evolutionary and eco-
logical drivers of biodiversity, on the macroevolution of
plants, on plant-insect interactions/pollination, on the
evolution of mating systems, hybridization and specia-
tion. The Dept. of Plant and Microbial Biology hosts
many groups working on plant molecular and develop-
mental biology, epigenetics, molecular evolution, com-
munity genomics, plant defence and plant adaptation.
Both institutes are housed in the beautiful Botanical
Gardens and host a diverse community of researchers
in plant biology.
Ideal candidates will have an MSc in biology with a
specialization in evolution, genetics, and/or bioinfor-
matics. This position primarily involves experimental
evolutionary research, bioinformatic work, and requires
advanced skills in handling, analyzing, and interpret-
ing high-throughput next-generation sequencing data.
Nevertheless, in the second phase of the PhD, reverse
genetic experiments are planned and thus good skills in
making constructs, carrying out genetic transformation,
and microscopy are also required. In case not all these
skills are covered, the willingness to quickly acquire
them is absolutely necessary. Students should be willing
to work both in the wet lab and in the oce doing com-
putational work. The position is for four years. Selected
candidates will enroll in the PhD Program Evolutionary

The Metazoa Phylogenomics Lab at the Institute of Evo-
lutionary Biology (IBE) is seeking to hire a Research
Assistant.
About IBE:
The Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE) was founded
in 2008 as a joint Institute of the Spanish National Re-
search Council (CSIC) and the Pompeu Fabra University
(UPF). It is located in Barcelona (Spain), in front of
the Mediterranean.
The mission of the IBE is to address biodiversity studies
describing functional and evolutionary genomics at all
levels of observation: molecular, biochemical, physiolog-
ical, and morphological. The IBE is the only research
center in Catalonia and Spain which completely devotes
its research to evolutionary biology, and it is currently a
reference in Southern Europe. Nowadays, IBE activity
involves more than 130 people and 23 research groups
distributed in 5 scientic programs related to Evolu-
tionary Biology research. Our employees enjoy access
to state-of-the-art technology and a diverse range of
specialist training opportunities, including support for
leadership and management.
About the Metazoa Phylogenomics Lab:
The overarching goal of the lab is to understand how
animals reshape their genomes to generate their vast
diversity and to adapt to the dierent environments.
For that, we generate and interrogate genomic and tran-
scriptomic data through the lens of phylogenomics and
comparative genomics. Our favorite creatures are arthro-
pods and annelids, but our interest often transcends the
level of phylum to understand animal genome evolution
at a macroevolutionary scale. We are committed to
maintaining a respectful, inclusive, and friendly work-
ing environment for all sta and students, as well aspromoting your personal and career development.
Rosa Fern ^A'ndez joined IBE as a Group Leader in
January 2020, so this is a chance to help build a lab
from the ground up and contribute your knowledge and
passion to the group and its culture. The lab is a part
of the Animal Biodiversity and Evolution Program at
IBE. We are currently funded by the Spanish Ministry
of Science and by an ERC Starting Grant to understand
the genomic basis of terrestrialization across animals.
About the role:
As a Research Assistant, your role will be to manage
the lab's day to day aairs, including managing a wet
molecular lab. You will be in charge of the wet lab orga-
nization and experiments, which will include DNA/RNA
extractions, library preparation and sequencing (Illu-
mina and Nanopore), and managing bacterial cultures
(for the protein engineering experiments). You will be
in charge of contacting vendors and placing orders and
help the PI with grant administration (ie, help process
invoices, etc.). You may be asked to supervise and
mentor others in the lab with experiments and tasks,
including postdoctoral researchers and PhD students.
Depending on your project involvement, you may also
be asked to help prepare or edit manuscripts (for which
you would receive authorship credit where appropriate)
and talks for presentations.
The ideal candidate:
The ideal candidate will have at least a BSc (under-
graduate) degree in life sciences with wet lab experi-
ence. A Master's or PhD in life sciences or equiva-
lent experience is desirable. You will have experience
with molecular biology and genetics techniques (ideally
including DNA and RNA extraction, library prepara-
tion for genome/transcriptome sequencing, Nanopore se-
quencing, and bacterial cultures), strong record-keeping
skills (e.g. lab notebook, collections maintenance, data
storage and organisation) and a strong command of
written and spoken English. You'll also be comfortable
maintaining the lab on a day to day basis, including
developing standard operating procedures, ordering and
maintaining laboratory supplies, managing and dispos-
ing of chemical inventory safely.
You will be comfortable working both independently
and as a member of a larger team, as well as having
good time management, attention to detail, and priori-
tisation skills. You'll be comfortable collaborating with
international and local colleagues from diverse cultures
and backgrounds. You will be able to travel locally and
internationally for e.g. collaborations or meetings.

Job summary
Applications are invited for a COVID-19 laboratory tech-
nician to join our recently awarded NERC grant \Map-
ping the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and envi-
ronmental samples", led by Professor Vincent Savolainen
and in collaboration with several groups at Imperial Col-
lege (Ransome, Bell, Woodward, Jones).
Mapping the prevalence of COVID-19 cases is essential
for designing and tracking the ecacy of control poli-
cies, such as social distancing and isolation. Community-
level estimates of disease prevalence should be sucient
to develop these mitigation strategies 'V especially when
the disease is widespread and infection is driven by com-
munity transmission. Given that there is now good
evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in faeces
for prolonged periods (even for otherwise asymptomatic
individuals), it may be possible to map the prevalence ofCOVID-19 using sewage samples. You will be part of a
multidisciplinary team of ecologists, virologists and mod-
ellers, who are testing sewage and connected freshwater
bodies for SARS-CoV-2 across the UK.
Your main role will be to help run high-throughput
robotically automated RT-PCR assays to quantify the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in sewage and
its derivatives across the UK. This will allow us to make
reliable inferences about the population-level prevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 by modelling RNA degradation from toi-
let to sample. The potential for sewage outows in the
environment to contribute to transmission to humans
and wildlife will also be investigated by assessing viral
infectivity from environmental samples. You will help to
run SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays, alongside our Post-
doctoral Researcher, in our dedicated containment level
3 (CL3) laboratory at Imperial College. You will also
help coordinate the collection and delivery of sewage and
environmental samples from across the UK. Please see
our website https://envirology.github.io/research.html
for more information about our team and the project.
Duties and responsibilities
To engage in research quantifying the presence and infec-
tivity of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, connected freshwater
bodies and animal faeces.
To carry out RNA extractions and RT-PCR assays using
robotic automation.
To culture cell lines for viral controls and infectivity
assays.
To complete viral infectivity assays in our dedicated
CL3 facility.
To manage the shipment of samples by partners across
the UK.
To work alongside our Postdoctoral Researcher to collect
environmental samples in London and SW England
Essential requirements:
- A science degree (BSc, MSC, or equivalent) - Rele-
vant technical or scientic role in Higher Education or
Industry laboratories - A track record of working in lab-
oratories (CL2 and/or CL3) - Experience in at least one

(CESAB<https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/-
about-the-foundation/le-cesab/ >) of the French Foun-
dation for Biodiversity Research is opening a call for re-
search projects, to fund at least three innovative projects
relating to the synthesis of ideas and concepts and/or
the analysis of existing data. The main aim of these
projects should be to improve scientic knowledge of
biodiversity and demonstrate how we can use this knowl-
edge to better protect it. The submitted projects can
deal with any topic related to biodiversity, in the elds
of natural sciences or human and social sciences.The selected projects will be funded for a period of three
years, including: the recruitment of a post-doctoral stu-
dent for two years, the organization of six meetings of
the working group at CESAB and the promotion and
publication of the results. The CESAB will also provide
logistical, technical and administrative support.
Members of CESAB projects share their scientic exper-
tise, available data and modeling tools to answer a wide
range of biodiversity questions at all spatial and tempo-
ral scales. Composed of a maximum of 14 experts, each
selected project must be coordinated by a recognized
scientist attached to a French research organization.

Grenoble Internship Biodiversity
WHAT : Internship \Biodiversity and emerging diseases:
a study of evolutionary biology using computer simula-
tions." WHERE : Grenoble, France
* Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has revived a de-
bate on the eect of biodiversity decline on the increase
in the frequency of zoonoses such as the one that gave
rise to the ongoing pandemic. Two mechanisms are
generally invoked to explain the negative correlation
between biodiversity and the frequency of zoonoses: the
rst implies that some of the human activities that de-
stroy biodiversity induce contact between it and humans
and thus increase the risk of zoonosis. The second cor-
responds to the dilution eect which invokes various
community ecology processes to explain the fact that
in areas with low biodiversity, the abundance of para-
sites is often greater, thus increasing the risk of zoonosis.
Although, from the parasite's point of view, the change
of host -a zoonosis- represents a major evolutionary leap,
the negative correlation between biodiversity and the
frequency of zoonoses has hardly ever been studied from
anevolutionary ecology perspective. This is the aim
of this internship.
* Aim of the internship: This course aims to study the
interactive eects between the 6th mass extinction of
living organisms and phenotypic stochasticity on the
frequency of zoonoses using simulations of host-parasite64 EvolDir November 1, 2020
co-evolutions. A mathematical and computer model to
simulate host-parasite co-evolution and changes in host
species has been developed. It allows studying the eect
of host population size on the risk of zoonosis. The aim
of this internship is to extend this model to include phe-
notypic stochasticity and to study the interaction eect
between this and the host population size on the risk
of zoonosis. The model is programmed in Julia[https:/-
/fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia %28langage%29]. This in-
ternship will require a good knowledge of evolutionary
biology, a certain ability for probabilistic calculation,
and a strong ability for programming or at least a good
control of computer tools and a very strong motiva-
tion to learn programming. Depending on the progress
of the student, this question *might* also be studied
at the genomic level using the model Aevol[http://-
www.aevol.fr/] developed by a team from Lyon with
whose we collaborate.
* Geographical situation and conditions of the intern-
ship: The internship will take place in the GEM team,
headed by Dominique Schneider, in the research unit
TIMC-IMAG (https://www-timc.imag.fr/) at Univer-
sity Grenoble Alps. As this internship does not require
any experimentation, a possible re-connement will only
have a moderate impact. The remuneration will be as
usual 620 euro /per month.

of motivation to Hugo Math e-Hubert hugo.mathe-

We do not understand what we see but see what we

Thoughts appear from doubts and die in convictions.
Therefore, doubts are an indication of strength and con-
victions an indication of weakness. Yet, most people
believe the opposite.
In their wide majority, civilisations are believing or have
believed in a religion. Moreover, stories that are told
by these religions are mutually incompatibles with each
other, and thus *at least* all but one are wrong. Humans

OriginOfTheEukaryoticCell
Two postdoc positions are available as part of a Si-
mons/Moore Foundation-funded project on the origin
of the eukaryotic cell.
We are searching for postdocs to develop and apply new
phylogenomic methods (particularly gene tree-species
tree reconciliation methods) to work on the timing of
eukaryotic origins and the nature of the genetic contri-
butions from archaeal host, bacterial endosymbiont, and
other possible sources.
We oer a chance to make progress on fundamental evo-
lutionary questions, and, as part of a broader initiative,
to interact with leading thinkers in the eld.
One of the positions (2.5 years) is in the Paleobiol-
ogy and Biodiversity Research Group at Bristol (witha supervisory team consisting of Tom Williams, Da-
vide Pisani, and Phil Donoghue), and one in the lab of
Gergely Sz oll ~Asi at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
(2 years).
The Bristol post is aimed at a \biologist who can use
a computer" (applying methods to new datasets is the
#1 task), while the Budapest post is aimed at someone
with an interest in algorithms and method development
(#1 task is extending existing methods, e.g. ALE, and
developing new ones).
The boundaries between the two aims, however, overlap
and the postdocs will, we hope, work closely together.
Given the challenges of the ongoing pandemic, we're
open to exible/remote arrangements.

Gothenburg TreeOfLife
Join us in building the Tree of Life for all plants! In
this 2-year postdoc project you'll work with a strong
international team to push the frontiers in molecular
phylogenetics. Based in Gothenburg, Sweden.
Project description The rapid increase in publicly avail-
able DNA sequence data now oers exciting opportu-
nities for building the 'Tree of Life' (phylogenies) that
establishes the relationships and temporal origins of all
living organisms. Although several attempts are being
made to build comprehensive molecular phylogenies, a
major challenge remains in how to eectively add newly
generated sequences to such trees without the need to
start from scratch every time. This project -\Online
phylogenetics"- will explore emerging Sequential Monte
Carlo techniques to add new sequences to existing trees
under a fully Bayesian framework. It will then validate
the method by building a continuously updating phy-
logenetic tree for all plant species sequenced to date.
Alternative approaches for building large trees, which
integrate genomic-wide and single-gene data, may be ex-
plored if necessary. The project is a collaboration among
internationally leading researchers at the University of
Gothenburg (Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre),
the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the Swedish Museum
of Natural History, the University of Stockholm, the
Royal Institute of Technology, Aarhus University and
the University of Michigan. Funding is provided through
a competitive grant from the Swedish Research Council.
Job assignments This employment includes the following
tasks: further development and/or testing of software
for phylogenetic analysis; responsibility for managing
own workload; production of scientic articles; eective
communication across the team and beyond; among
other assignments depending on the candidate's skills
and interests in relation to the project's objectives. El-
igibility The applicant must hold a PhD degree in an
area relevant for the tasks at hand (e.g., computational
biology, molecular phylogenetics, bioinformatics) or a
foreign exam substantially equivalent to a PhD degree
in a relevant subject. Preference will be given to candi-
dates who have been awarded the degree no more than
three years before the application deadline. Applicants
with a degree awarded earlier may also be preferred
if specic reasons exist. Such specic reasons may be
a leave due to illness, parental leave or other similarcircumstances.

2 year Postdoc, Link oping University, Sweden
Title: Quantitative genetics of gene expression regula-
tion using single cell technologies.
For this position we are looking for a candidate with a
strong background in single cell sequencing, quantitative
genetics and bioinformatics. The project will involve a
large amount of single cell Sequencing data (including
both ss RNAseq and ss ATACseq data). The project
will require a combination of expression and ATAC seq
QTL analysis using the data generated by this single
cell sequence data. The candidate should therefore be
either procient in all of these techniques or have spe-cialisation in at least one (with single cell seq data a
particular benet). The project itself is funded by an
ERC consolidator grant and is aiming to use a series
of dierent populations of feralised chickens (domestic
birds that have escaped and are now living wild through-
out the Hawaiian Island chain), in combination with
a wild x domestic chicken intercross to map the genes
and polymorphisms underlying their rapid responses
to newly imposed selective forces. In this instance the
combination of integrating both ss eQTL and ssATAC-
seq QTL will enable the identication of the genetic
basis of transcriptomic regulation occurring between
wild and domestic chickens down to the specic cell
type, whilst the simultaneous mapping of epigenomic
and transcriptomic data from the same nucleus should
also enable the identication of both the causal ele-
ments and causal genes for the regulatory machine in
the chicken hypothalamus. Representative papers for
the intercross and the feral birds can be found in the fol-

PhD POSITION IN PLANT EVOLUTIONARY GE-
NOMICS
Applications are invited for a PhD position in the
research group of prof. Martin Lysak (CEITEC,
Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; http://-
www.plantcytogenomics.org) to join project investigat-
ing the structure and evolution of Biscutella genomes
(Brassicaceae). The project aims to establish high-
quality chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of sev-
eral genomes and analyze the process of post-polyploid
diploidization and chromosomal rearrangements. This
is a collaborative project between the Lysak group
and group of prof. Christian Parisod (University Bern,
Switzerland).
Project outline: Genome divergence is usually associ-
ated with chromosomal changes that mostly results from
short indels, gene loss and duplication, chromosome
rearrangements (CRs) and activity of transposable ele-
ments (TEs). Molecular events such as CRs, promoting
the reduction of genome size and chromosome num-
bers (i.e. descending dysploidy), appear decisive for the
evolution of plants undergoing recurrent whole-genome76 EvolDir November 1, 2020
duplications. Genomic underpinnings and evolutionary
signicance of chromosomal restructuring however re-
main underexplored. We aim to sequence, analyze and
compare genomes of nine Biscutella species (Buckler
Mustards; Brassicaceae) diering by genome sizes (0.7
to 1.2 Gbp) and chromosome numbers (x = 6, 8, 9).
We will combine genome sequence data with long-range
scaolding and molecular cytogenetics to obtain accu-
rate chromosome-scale assemblies and annotate them
using transcriptomics data. Comparative genomics will
then quantify small- vs large-scale restructuring events
and how much they aect coding vs non-coding regions
of chromosomes. This will not only identify underly-
ing molecular mechanisms, but will further address the
impact of gain vs loss of gene and TE sequences on
genome size evolution and dysploid CRs during species
diversication. Providing an unprecedented structural
framework for comparative genomics, this work will oer
concrete methodological advances and bring fresh con-
clusions of general interest for molecular plant breeders
and evolutionary biologists regarding mechanisms and
processes driving the evolution of chromosome number
and genome size in land plants.
Requirements:
Candidates should have strong theoretical background
in comparative genomics, bioinformatics and experience
with analyzing next-generation sequence data. We are
looking for highly motivated individual open to frequent
interactions with other lab members and members of
our Czech-Swiss multi-disciplinary team.

Overview: Our project aims to design, pilot, and test a
set of interactive and integrative instructional materials
for introductory biology courses. The materials will
be focused on the evolutionary basis of human medi-
cal conditions. These materials will facilitate student
understanding of human evolution, by exploring health
conditions. Many, if not most, students are introduced
to evolution in an introductory biology course where
the topic is studied in isolation from other content for
a very short period of time. Instruction is often based
broadly on \natural selection and adaptation", with con-
nections rarely made to the molecular and/or cellular
events involved in evolutionary processes. Unfortunately,
this type of treatment is some students' sole experience
studying evolution. As a result, many students do not
acquire a solid foundation in basic evolutionary concepts,
let alone the tools or examples needed to understand
how evolution is applicable to humans. In this project
we will build, pilot, and disseminate curricular materials
that clarify the evolutionary underpinnings of several
human diseases and health conditions. The integrative
case curriculum by the Evo-Ed project (www.evo-ed.org)
provides a backdrop for the type of curriculum develop-
ment and integrated nature of the curricular materials
we plan to design, pilot, and test here. We intend to ex-
plore how engaging in evolutionary medicine curriculum,
with ties to the relevant social and cultural contexts,
helps students develop a better understanding of both
evolution and human medicine.

A postdoc position is available to work on historical
DNA from bird sub-fossils, museum skin specimens and
fresh samples to develop a novel real-time assessment of
genetic response to anthropogenic environmental change
across multiple bird species following rst human arrival
in a pristine environment. The time series is designed to
examine the long-term processes leading to variation in
extinction risk between closely related species, compar-
ing dierences in demographic and selective responses
to common environmental changes.
The position is part of a project funded by the French
National Research Agency (ANR), that links compe-

Evolutionary history is expected to play a major role
in determining which species decline in population size
to extinction in response to environmental change, but
the processes by which this comes about are poorly un-
derstood. Although population genetic studies provide
much promise to understand the microevolutionary pro-
cesses behind macroevolutionary patterns of extinction
risk, inferences can be limited by our condence in the
timescales inferred, and by the scale of such studies,
which frequently include only one lineage. As a key-
player in project ANR Suscept-Ext, the postdoc will
tackle both of these issues, applying ancient DNA meth-
ods to museum (historical & subfossil) samples to obtain
a genome-wide time series for multiple Mascarene island
bird lineages that dier in abundance and other biologi-
cal traits. Islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Mau-
ritius & R eunion), Indian Ocean, are unusual among
sizable and biologically diverse landmasses worldwide,
in that they had no human population until European
arrival 400 years ago. Therefore, there exist museum
samples and subfossils spanning the full duration of an-
thropogenic environmental change, allowing a real-time
assessment of genetic response to environmental changes
of known timing and across multiple species following
rst human presence.
Major goals for the postdoc include: 1) as a top priority,
developing a working protocol and obtaining reliable
genome-wide data from a variety of bird historical DNA
samples, including museum skins (toe-pads), and sub-
fossils up to 12,000 YBP from a variety of preserva-
tional environments including limestone and volcanic
rock caves (essential), as well as attempting those of
anoxic marshes;
2) playing a key role in DNA extraction and interac-
tion with external genomics companies in order to ob-
tain both de novo reference genomes and re-sequenced
genomes from fresh samples;
3) analysing the resulting genetic time series (modern
and historical genome-wide data of varying complete-
ness) to track temporal changes in demography and
selection since rst human arrival in the Mascarenes ~
400 generations ago.
Funding has also been obtained for a PhD student to
work alongside the postdoc in data analysis, the ancient
DNA lab and/or method development, beginning by
Year 2 at the latest.
Candidates are expected to have proven experience ingenerating and analysing genome-wide ancient or his-
torical DNA data, and should ideally:
- have a strong interest in the broad theme of the study
- understanding the role of evolutionary history in de-
termining which species decline towards extinction in
response to environmental change - be interested in rel-
evant population genomic methods - show willingness,
if needed, to play a key role in training a PhD student

spatio-temporal dynamics of Marantaceae forests, a
presumably stable state of degraded forests in central
Africa.
The will be based at the main AMAP headquarter in
Montpellier, France, but will work in close collabora-
tion with the Forest and Society <https://ur-forets-
societes.cirad.fr/en >lab, also in Montpellier. She/He
will have the opportunity to conduct eldwork in the
north of the Republic of Congo.
The contract will start on 01/12/2020, with a duration
of 12 months. The salary depends on the experience
of the postdoctoral researcher (gross monthly salary
of 2150 ' ~A for juniors ( <2 years after phD) and 2500
'~A for seniors (2-5 years after phD)). Candidates with
experience >5 years after phD cannot apply.
#### Context
The spatio-temporal dynamics of forest degradation is
poorly known in the tropics, despite its importance for
understanding global biogeochemical cycles or for the
implementation of carbon mitigation strategies. For-
est degradation in the tropics has so far been mostly
studied from an ecological succession perspective, where
successional processes drive the system into a suppos-
edly stable and \mature" state. However, disturbances
may also produce deep and lasting modications of the
forest dynamics, pushing the system to bifurcate to an
alternative stable state or to an arrested succession.
Our project focuses on a system that probably corre-
sponds to such a stable degraded forest state in central
Africa, the Marantaceae forests. These forests exhibit
a very low tree density, almost no tree regeneration, avery low oristic diversity and an impenetrable dense
understory composed of giant herbs ( >2 m) mostly
belonging to the Marantaceae (arrowroot) and Zingib-
eraceae (ginger) families. They currently cover very
large areas in central Africa where they have been lit-
tle explored, though representing a critical issue for
forest managers. Some previous unpublished works sug-
gest that these forests are extremely stable in time,
some likely resulting from anthropogenic disturbances
dated from more than 1000 years BP. Besides human
disturbances, some Marantaceae forests established fol-
lowing extreme dry events. Thus, under the on-going
conjunction of climate change and increasing anthro-
pogenic disturbances, Marantaceae forests are expected
to expand at the expense of dense mature forests with
important consequences for forest biodiversity, carbon
sequestration and other ecosystem services.
#### Job description
The main objective of this postdoctoral project is
to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of the central
African Marantaceae forests in order to assess their
long-term stability and dynamics. Our overall approach
consists in combining local eld experiments, remote
sensing analyses and historical ecology approaches. The
post-doctoral fellow is intended to conduct an original
study from already available data including i) eld inven-
tories; ii) old (1950s) aerial photographs; iii) very high
resolution satelitte images and; iv) multiple UAV acqui-
sitions with passive images and LiDAR measurements.
The main idea is to use time series of remote sensing data
and multiple eld censuses to test whether Marantaceae
forests naturally increase in undisturbed (protected ar-
eas) and in disturbed (logged) forests and to assess
whether they constitute stable systems (i.e. whether
shifts from Marantaceae forests to closed-canopy forests
can be observed or not).
The expected results will both bring new insights on
the conditions of stability of coexisting forest states,
which so far have remained elusive, and have strong
implications for forest management and conservation in
central Africa.
#### The team
Our group is composed of c. 10 permanent researchers
and PhD students working in tropical
forest ecology and having extended eld experience in
Central African forests
(see http://amap.cirad.fr/en/th11.php and http://-
amap.cirad.fr/en/th9.php). The team also have a strong
experience in remote sensing of forest structure, includ-
ing passive and active sensors. We have our own inte-
grated UAV systems with multispectral cameras and80 EvolDir November 1, 2020

#### Qualications

searcher in remote sensing, with a background on forest
systems. The postdoc should have strong data analysis

Postdoctoral Opportunity to work on molecular mecha-
nisms of dengue virus transmission.
We are currently recruiting a post-doc to work with
Dr. Julien Pompon in the MIVEGEC unit at IRD,
Montpellier, France (https://www.mivegec.ird.fr/en/-
207-english/equipes-en-gb-8/see/1218-tve-uk?Itemid=-
523& ; https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-
wRQf0q8AAAAJ&hl=en). The group studies the
molecular mechanisms of arbovirus transmission by
mosquitoes to unravel novel intervention strategies.
The group is located in a dynamic and well-equipped
environment, with access to BSL2 and BSL3 wet
laboratories and BSL2 and BSL3 insectaries and
multiple omics platforms.
Julien was recently awarded an ANR grant (VirSalivaEn-
hancer) to study transmission enhancers in mosquito
saliva. At the interphase between human, mosquito and
virus, the saliva and its components determines infection
onset in the skin during biting, and thus transmission.
We recently discovered a new saliva enhancer that we
want to characterize.
In this stimulating environment, the post doc fellow will
characterize the new saliva enhancer by using molecular
entomology, cell biology, a range of omics (RNAseq,
proteomics, metabolomics), single-cell RNA sequencing,
animal model and entomology. This multidisciplinary
project will reveal a new player in mosquito transmission
and determine its mechanism of action. Eventually, theproject should end up identifying a vaccine candidate
active against multiple arboviruses.
The ideal candidate will have experience in molecular
biology and cell biology and an excellent track-record of
publications. The candidate should have a high level of
intellectual engagement and excellent problem-solving
skills. The ability to work independently and generate
hypotheses is essential.
Montpellier is a sunny and culturally lively environ-
ment located between the Mediterranean Sea and the
Cevennes mountains. The local research community
is very active in medical biology. We propose a two-
year contract and expect the candidate to seek its own
fellowship. Salary is attractive and will depend upon
experience. Only selected candidates will be invited for
interview.

SussexU EvolTransposableElements
Applications are invited for the post of Research Assis-
tant in Molecular Biology/Genetics based in the School
of Life Sciences at the University of Sussex; one of theUK's most prestigious universities.
Undertaking research in a vibrant, inter-disciplinary
research environment with an excellent international
reputation, you will work as a key member of a research
team investigating the function and evolution of plant
genomes with a particular emphasis on transposable
elements (TEs).
TEs represent the majority of eukaryotic DNA, for ex-
ample they occupy ~50% of the human genome and up
to 80-90% of the genomes of some plants. Our lab is in-
terested in understanding the interactions between TEs
and their host genomes by focusing both on mechanistic
and evolutionary perspectives.
We are seeking for a skilled molecular biologist to work
on a project trying to elucidate how the 3D organi-
sation of chromosomes within the nucleus aects the
integration of new TE copies in the genome.
When TEs are active, new copies are generated that
integrate in various chromosomal locations. Integration
of new TE copies in the genome is a process that is
modulated on several molecular levels. One such level,
the folding and positioning of chromosomes inside the
nucleus, has only recently been recognised as a poten-
tially important parameter, but so far has only rarely
been integrated in experimental studies or accounted for
in modelling. By using Arabidopsis thaliana lines with
active TEs and by testing various tissues, you will i) iden-
tify TE families that are actively transposing, ii) identify
the chromosomal integration loci of the new TE copies,
and iii) produce and analyze whole-genome methylation
data. The ultimate aim of the project is to combine
analyses of TE, epigenetic, chromosome conformation
capture (Hi-C) and modelling data to characterize the
epigenetic and 3D structure of the host cells where the
new TE copies have inserted.
This is an excellent opportunity for a molecular biologist
wishing to apply their skills to an innovative area of sci-
ence. The position is supported by a grant of the Royal
Society and is associated with generous research funds.
Funding may be available after the completion of the
Royal Society support. The candidate will collaborate
with colleagues in UK (Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Nuetzmann,
Dr. Davide Michieletto) and US (Prof. Keith Slotkin).

*Postdoc Positions in Plant Evolutionary Genomics*
Two postdoctoral fellowships in evolutionary genomics
are available in the research group of Christian Parisod
at the University of Bern. We investigate interactions
between transposable elements and duplicated genes
following whole-genome duplication (WGD).
*Tasks*: Successful applicants will generate
chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of multiple
genomes across diploid Biscutella species (Brassicaceae)
diering in genome size and chromosomal structure
following an ancient WGD event. We also focus on
variation within the Biscutella laevigata species that
recently colonized the Alps following an additional
WGD event (autopolyploidy). Comparative genomics,
combined with population genomics and expression data
sets will address the process of genome restructuring
and evolutionary diversication during post-polyploid
diploidization. The two postdocs will collaborate on
either within vs among species analyses or according
to their specic interests. Part of the work is a
collaborative project with the Lysak group (CEITEC,
Brno; http://www.plantcytogenomics.org). Further
synergies are expected with other group members
addressing complementary questions, using natural and
experimental populations of B. laevigata.
*Requirements*: We are looking for candidates who
have obtained a PhD degree within the last ve years
and show excellent background in comparative genomics
and bioinformatics. Experience with either chromosome-
scale genome assembly and annotation, analysis of trans-
posable elements or duplicated genes and willingness
to develop complementary expertise is welcomed. Suc-
cessful applicants will be highly motivated to address
evolutionary genomic questions and able to work inde-
pendently yet open to frequent interactions with other
members of our Swiss-Czech multi-disciplinary team.
*We oer*: Positions are available form 01. 01. 2021
(or upon agreement) and come with a highly competi-tive salary for up to three years on annually renewable
contracts. We oer a stimulating and supportive en-
vironment fostering collaborations with international
research teams. The working language in our Institute
of Plant Sciences is English. The group, nested within
the Department of Biology, is located in the Botani-
cal Garden of the central city of Bern and is therefore
close to other major research centers in Switzerland and
beyond.
*Application*: To ensure full consideration, applica-
tions must be sent to christian.parisod@ips.unibe.ch as
a single (!) PDF le including a cover letter describing
research interests and achievements, a CV including

HostParasiteCoevolution
University of Connecticut: Postdoctoral researcher in
the genetics of host-parasite coevolution
A postdoctoral research position is available in
Dr. Daniel Bolnick's research group (https://-
bolnicklab.wordpress.com), in the Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolution at the University of Connecticut. The
postdoc will join an ongoing NIH-funded project to use
CRISPR/cas9 gene editing of threespine stickleback to
evaluate the phenotypic eect of candidate genes on host
immune phenotypes and resistance to cestode infection.
The postdoc may also begin work on a related question
of how cestode genotype aects infection outcome.
Tasks: The postdoctoral researcher will combine ex-
perimental genetics with immune challenges to iden-
tify the genetic and immunological basis of rapidly-
evolved population dierences in stickleback immu-
nity to a cestode parasite, and associated costly im-
munopathology. The Bolnick lab has identied natu-
rally evolved heritable dierences in stickleback shes'
ability to resist infection, and suppress growth of es-tablished cestodes. This resistance entails a recently-
evolved brosis immune response that can be experi-
mentally studied using an articial vaccination strat-
egy (see https://bolnicklab.wordpress.com/2015/10/-
12/bolnick-lab-publications/ for recent publications con-
cerning evolution of cestode resistance and brosis).
Using QTL mapping, GWAS, population genomic diver-
gence, and transcriptomics we have identied promising
candidate genes potentially underlying these immuno-
logical dierences. With funding from NIH, we have
successfully implemented CRISPR/cas9 gene editing of
some candidate genes. The postdoc hired for this po-
sition will extend this gene editing work to encompass
more replicates, more candidate genes, and evaluate
the phenotypic eect of these transgenic manipulations
using experimental infections and articial vaccination
assays. The work will be based at the University of
Connecticut, though some eld work may be necessary,
such as to breed sh for lab work or to obtain cestodes.
The postdoc will be responsible for conducting lab and
eld work, co-supervising laboratory technicians and
students, data analysis and publication. Opportunities
exist to pursue side-projects along with the core project
task.
Duration: The position is available for up to two years,
subject to annual review of performance. The position
could extend longer, contingent on availability of ad-
ditional grant funds. The postdoc should be able to
start in spring or summer of 2021, exact dates to be
negotiated with the PI.
Compensation: Starting salary will be $52,850, plus
health benets. Qualications: Applicants must have a
PhD in evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, or
a closely related eld. Prior experience with molecular
genetics or immunology is essential (preferably both).
Expertise in CRISPR/cas9 gene editing is strongly pre-
ferred. Previous research experience and publications
should demonstrate a commitment to basic research,
good work ethic, lab skills, organizational ability, and
publication productivity. Applications should electroni-
cally submit a single pdf le containing the following,

UEdinburgh QuantitativeGenetics
Open position for a postdoctoral research fellow at the
Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, on
project on genomics and gene editing in pigs.
Please forward to those who might be interested!
https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin/work-study/-
opportunities/vacancies/research-fellow To analyse
sequence data on a huge pig data set. Closing: 15
October
The Roslin Institute is a world-class centre for research
on the quantitative genetics of populations, particularly
in managed populations such as livestock, companion
animals, forests and crops. We have a vacancy for a post-
doctoral researcher in quantitative genetics/genome-
editing, to work on a project, led by Prof. Richard
Mellanby in collaboration with our industrial partners
PIC (part of Genus plc). In the past three years the
project has generated one of the largest and most pow-
erful livestock genetics data sets globally with accurate
whole genome sequence information and phenotypes on
hundreds and thousands of individuals. Plans are in
place to utilise/interrogate this data to develop an Allele
Testing platform, a large scale genome-wide experimen-
tal and computational framework, for identication of
causal variants in livestock.This project has four aims: (1). Develop an \Allele
Testing" framework using genomics analyses, grounded
in quantitative genetics, population genetics and bioin-
formatics, to generate a ranked list of causal genomic
variants from whole genome sequence data; (2). Use
genome-editing to introduce putative causal genomic
variants into an in vitro cell system for phenotypic inter-
rogation; (3). Undertake such analyses in a very large
dataset encapsulating phenotype and sequence data in
pigs to make novel discoveries about animal genomics
(4). Deploy this knowledge to develop novel strategies
to apply genomic information in breeding.
Successful applicant will become part of a large team
of computational biologists, animal and plant breeders,
quantitative geneticists, computer scientists and bio-
physicists. You will actively contribute to biological
discovery in huge livestock datasets, their validation by
genome-editing in vitro, and be supported to create new
breeding program designs and strategies to accelerate
genetic improvement in livestock.
Given the diverse challenges of this post, the successful
applicant may have (or be close to having) a PhD from
a diverse set of areas. Applicants with a background
in Animal Breeding, Quantitative Genetics, Bioinfor-
matics with experience in Cell and Molecular biology,
and Gene-Editing technologies are strongly encouraged
to apply. Key is the ability to work within the group
and to contribute to the project goals. The ideal candi-
date will have experience in research and development
activities. The post-holder will join the Genetics and Ge-
nomics department at the Institute which comprises 18
group leaders, both desk based and lab based scientists.
The department benets from synergies arising from
academic backgrounds including DNA-chemistry, statis-
tics, mathematics and theoretical physics in addition to
genetics.
This is a xed term post until 31st December, 2022
Informal enquires can be made to Richard Mellanby
(Richard.Mellanby@ed.ac.uk) or Melissa Jungnickel
(melissa.jungnickel@roslin.ed.ac.uk), while formal ap-
plications should be submitted through The University

*** Full time 2-year postdoc position in biodiversity
science and macroecology ***
I oer a 2-year full-time postdoctoral position in macroe-
cology, ecological statistics, biogeography, and spatial
ecology. The candidate will join the small team of Dr.
Petr Keil (https://petrkeil.github.io/website/) at the
Dpt. of Applied Geography and Spatial Planning at the
Faculty of Environmental Sciences of Czech University
of Life Sciences in Prague, Czech Republic (https://-
www.fzp.czu.cz/en/).
The postdoctoral project will be related to biodiversity
and its patterns in space and time, and across spa-
tial scales. The position is thematically exible; in an
ideal case we will nd a topic that reects both the
candidate's and my interests, and that ts the depart-
ment. I am interested in how biodiversity (and its facets)
changes in time, which includes extinctions and inva-sions, their spatial and temporal scaling, and drivers of
the change - check my website for more details. I have
a broad taxonomic focus, we can work on terrestrial
taxa (plants, vertebrates, insects), as well as freshwater,
marine, or microbial groups. Elements of evolutionary
biology, historical biogeography, or applied conservation
issues are also attractive, and particularly welcome is
a drive to cross discipline boundaries. Purely method-
ological and statistical topics are also great. Work done
in my lab will be mostly computational, with emphasis
on statistics and simulations (in R, Python, or similar)
and geographic information systems (GIS). However,
I am open to ideas for experiments and eldwork. I
value originality, independence, and initiative, and I en-
courage applicants to propose their own research ideas.
During the 2 years, the postdoc will have my support
to work on their own grant or fellowship applications.
Apart from dissemination of scientic results via journal
publications and conferences, I expect the postdoc to
participate on workshops and training, and there will
also be teaching opportunities.
Requirements
- PhD in ecology, geography, zoology, botany, bioinfor-
matics, biostatistics, environmental sciences, or related
eld. PhDs in mathematics, physics, or statistics are
also interesting. - Ability to publish in peer-reviewed
journals. - Experience with spatial/geographical data. -
Experience with statistical analyses and simulations in
R, Python, or similar environment. - I aim to increase
the diversity of my team, and I welcome applicants of
all genders, cultures, backgrounds, ages, or countries.
I believe that a diverse team will broaden perspective
and enhance creativity.
We oer
- Gross salary of 50,000 CZK/month (1,886 EUR as of
9/9/2020), which is ca 36,500 CZK/month net, but the
latter varies depending on family situation and other
circumstances. Median salary in the Czech Republic
at the end of 2019 was ca 31,000 CZK/month gross.
Living costs are generally lower than in Western Europe
(see https://www.sreality.cz/en for costs of accommo-

USDA CornellU GWAS
The position is with the USDA-ARS Plant Soil and
Nutrition Research Unit and our lab is co-located in the
Plant Breeding and Genetics Section at Cornell Univer-
sity. Our lab maintains the largest publicly available
data resource on eld and genotyping trials for wheat,
barley, and oat: the Triticeae Toolbox (T3, triticeaetool-
box.org). The postdoc will leverage de novo assembled
genomes in these species to create an imputation en-
gine, which, combined with T3 data, will enable more
powerful association analyses than ever before in these
species
The USDA-ARS Plant Soil and Nutrition Research Unit
and the Cornell Plant Breeding & Genetics Section
train interdisciplinary scientists in the elaboration of
new breeding methods, the discovery of genetic mecha-
nisms important for economically important traits, and
the creation of genetic stocks, germplasm, and varieties.
We promote a collaborative and interactive workspace to
improve learning, cross connectivity, and mutual support
between basic and applied researchers. We are world
leaders in innovative plant breeding research, teaching,
and extension, and we collaborate globally.
The Jannink lab works with several crop species (wheat,
oat, barley, cassava, and the brown algae sugar kelp) to
develop genomic prediction methods and integrate them
optimally into breeding schemes. We work together to
discover, build on, and share new ideas and tools from
across computational disciplines that lead to successful
applied breeding outcomes. The valuable phenotypic
data resource that we have compiled over more than ten
years in T3 contains lines that have been genotyped on
a number of dierent platforms, preventing a powerful
joint analysis. Recent decreases in the cost of long-read sequencing have facilitated the de novo assembly
of small but diverse panels in our target species. These
panels sample a high percentage of the haplotypes seg-
regating across the genome in domesticated populations
and thus enable whole-genome sequence imputation for
any line that is genotyped at sucient density. Imputa-
tion, in turn, creates a uniform, high density marker set
across lines as needed by many genotype-to-phenotype
mapping analyses. The postdoc will work in this com-
putational genetics space and collaborate with software
developers to make analyses available to public-sector
breeders globally.
We seek a candidate with computational biology exper-
tise and interest in large-scale genotype-to-phenotype
analyses as well as in software development. Primary
tools for the analyses exist. The postdoc will imple-
ment them in robust code deployable in the cloud or
local servers, apply them to data in T3, and publish
methodology and discovery articles. In addition to
T3, the campus hosts much relevant software devel-
opment: Breedbase (breedbase.org), GOBii (gobiipro-
ject.org), Breeding Insight ( breedinginsight.org), and
BrAPI (brapi.org). The postdoc will collaborate when-
ever fruitful with these eorts to extend functionality
to broader audiences.

PopulationGenomics
The research group of John Pool at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison invites applications for a postdoc-
toral research position. There are multiple potential
project areas, with an overarching theme of addressing
big questions in population/evolutionary genetics. I'd
like to give the successful candidate for this position a
strong voice in shaping their research direction in the
lab.
The Pool Lab has a longstanding emphasis on the Ge-
netic Architecture of Adaptive Evolution and an emerg-
ing focus on the Genetic Architecture of Early Stage
Reproductive Isolation. While the range of potential
projects is fairly broad, I am especially interested in
prospective postdocs who might like to establish new
research directions in one of the following areas:
* Estimating Adaptive Potential from Genomic Varia-
tion It is widely recognized that genetic diversity is a
primary determinant of whether populations can rapidly
adapt to new challenges. Yet despite its relevance to
basic evolutionary biology and conservation, our under-
standing of adaptive potential is still quite lacking. Our
lab is interested in which types of genetic diversity are
most important for adaptive potential (e.g. neutral vs.
adaptive variation) and how best to estimate adaptive
potential within and among populations.
* Fundamental Population Genetic Inference from Pop-
ulation Dierentiation We are interested in leverag-
ing large data sets (such the >1000 genomes from our
Drosophila Genome Nexus) to ask foundational popula-
tion genetic questions. Most relevant studies have only
considered data from a single population, whereas we areespecially interested in utilizing genetic dierentiation
between populations to address classic but unresolved
questions about the inuence of natural selection on
genomic diversity, such as the relative importance of
selective sweeps and background selection.
Our research group was founded 9 years ago and cur-
rently includes 1 postdoc and 6 graduate students. I
have also advised 5 former postdocs, and the publi-
cation records of Amir Yassin and Justin Lack show
what a productive environment our lab can be. I also
welcome postdocs taking important components of our
research with them when they found their own labs. Fur-
ther lab info: http://www.johnpool.net UW-Madison
oers a superb scientic environment with a support-
ive, collaborative, and egalitarian culture. Many labs
focus on population genetics, evolutionary genomics,
and Drosophila research: https://evolution.wisc.edu/-
people/faculty/ https://genetics.wisc.edu/drosophila-
and-other-insects/ Madison oers an exceptional quality
of life in a beautiful landscape, and has been ranked as
the best US city for young adults. Downtown and cam-
pus are bordered by lakes, and Madison features diverse
art, music, cultural, and culinary oerings. http://-
www.visitmadison.com/media/rankings/ I am highly
interested in adding to the diversity of our lab in a broad
sense, including gender balance, cultural perspectives,
and intellectual backgrounds and skill sets.
To apply, send a statement of research interests (up to
1 page) addressing the intersection between your own
scientic interests and the Pool lab's research in terms
of potential projects, along with a CV and contact info
for 3 references.
Start dates are exible. Salary follows the NIH scale.
Individual or family health insurance is oered. Appli-
cants outside the US may be able to start remotely for
the initial months of the postdoc.
Applications are due December 1. However, earlier ap-
plications are welcome, and later applications may still
be considered. Informal pre-application inquiries (e.g.
to discuss potential research topics) are also welcome at
any time.

PathogenEvolution
Postdoc in Molecular Ecology of Vector-Borne
Pathogens
We are looking for a postdoctoral scholar who will be
a part of an interdisciplinary team focused on evolu-
tionary ecology and molecular ecology of insect vectors
and insect-borne pathogens of vegetable and seed crops
in the Pacic Northwest USA. Crops throughout this
region, including potatoes, beets, carrots, radish, onions,
and seed crops are threatened by vector-borne pathogens
transmitted by aphids, leafhoppers, and psyllids (among
others). Many of these insect pests use both crop and
non-crop hosts in the landscape, and transmission of
pathogens depends on movement within and between
dierent habitat patches. Pathogens carried by insect
vectors can also aect relationships between vectors and
hosts, and co-evolution between vectors, pathogens, and
their hosts can strongly inuence pathogen dynamics
over long time scales. However, we currently have only
a limited understanding of insect feeding behavior and
host use and the evolutionary ecology of vectors and
their hosts. The postdoctoral associate will work within
the broader team to evaluate the sources of vector-
borne pathogens into crops by conducting molecular
'gut-content analysis' of insect vectors to assess host
use. In addition, the postdoc will be given considerable
exibility to develop additional lines of inquiry based on
their own expertise, particularly in the realm of molec-
ular plant-insect-pathogen interactions. The position
will involve collaborative research with a broad team of
researchers in Washington and Oregon and will involve
both eld and laboratory research. Given the need for
a person to conduct laboratory work, unfortunately we
cannot accept applications from postdocs who wish to
work remotely, although we understand the challengesof moving in the current climate.
Salary for the position will be $49,500 per year. The po-
sition oers full benets including health insurance, life
insurance, and retirement benets. Salary support has
been obtained for at least two years, with possibility of
extension for multiple additional years pending success-
ful performance evaluations and continued availability
of funding.
To apply: Please send a cover letter detailing interest
in the position, a current CV, and a list of 3 profes-
sional references to Dave Crowder (dcrowder@wsu.edu).
Applications will be reviewed as they are received.
Anticipated Start Date: Position available immediately,
although we are hoping to have someone in place no
later than 1/01/2021.
Required Qualications: PhD in Plant Pathology, Molec-
ular Biology, Entomology, or related scientic elds
obtained within 5 years of the start date. Strong demon-
strated background in molecular biology and/or insect
vector biology.

DEADLINE OCTOBER 15TH REGISTER NOW!
Gutenberg Workshops presents: Aging in Social Insects
25 - 28 November 2020 jIngelheim, near Mainz (Ger-
many)
Hybrid workshop format
A characteristic of social insects is reproductive divi-
sion of labor, which led to the evolution of disparate
phenotypes or castes, which dier not only in behavior
and reproduction, but also in lifespan. Indeed, social
insect queens can live for many years (up to several
decades), whereas their workers are much shorter lived.
In most social insects, female eggs are totipotent and
can develop into either queens or workers, in response
to conditions experienced during larval development.
Recent advances in molecular biology allow the eld
of social insect biology to investigate the genes, path-
ways and gene regulatory mechanisms that control caste
dierences. It is of great interest beyond social insect re-
search to determine which molecular mechanisms allow
social insect queens to live so long.
ThisGutenberg Workshop on Aging in Social Insectswill
bring together researchers investigating the evolution
and molecular basis of lifespan in social insects with
researchers working on longevity in other model organ-
isms to understand how social evolution led to shifts in
the molecular regulation of aging.

Online BigDataBiogeography Feb1-5
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 2nd ONLINE edi-
tion of the Physalia course on Big data Biogeography -
Species occurrences through space and time.
When: 1-5 February 2021
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course48/ )
Instructors: Dr. Alex Zizka (German Centre for Integra-
tive Biodiversity Research (iDiv) in Leipzig, Germany)
and Dr. Daniele Silvestre ( University of Lausanne,
Switzerland)
The public availability of large-scale species distribution
data has increased drastically over the last ten years.
In particular, due to the aggregation of records from
museums and herbaria, and citizen science in public
databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility (GBIF). This is leading to a 'big data' revolu-
tion in biogeography, which holds an enormous but still
poorly explored potential for understanding large scale
patterns and drivers of biodiversity in space and time.
After this course, students will be able to:
Obtain and prepare large scale species occurrence
records from public databases in R (including data min-
ing, data cleaning and exploration)
Apply novel methods for handling and processing 'big
data' in biogeographic research, including area classi-
cation, bioregionalization and automated conservation
assessments
Reconstruct species ancestral ranges based on species
occurrences and phylogenetic trees, using dierent evo-
lutionary models
Understand the potential and caveats of fossil based
biogeography, and be familiar with novel methods to
estimate ancestral ranges and evolutionary rates from
ranges of extinct and extant taxa

Dear all, registrations are now open for our 2 ONLINE
courses:
1) Genome Assembly and Annotation (15-19 February)
with Dr. Thomas Otto (University of Glasgow) and Mr.
Max Driller (Begendiv, Berlin).
This course will introduce biologists and bioinformati-
cians to the concepts of de novo assembly and anno-
tation. Dierent technologies, from Illumina, PacBio,
Oxford Nanopore and maybe 10X will be used mixed
with dierent approaches like correction, HiC scaolding
to generate good draft assemblies. Particular attention
will be given to the quality control of the assemblies
and to the understanding how errors occur. Further,
annotation tools using RNA-Seq data will be introduced.
An outlook of potential analysis is given. In the end of
the course the students should be able to understand
what is needed to generate a good annotated genome.

2) GENOME ASSEMBLY USING OXFORD
NANOPORE SEQUENCING (22-26 February)
with Dr. Robert Vaser and Mr. Josip Maric (University
of Zagreb) .
This course will introduce the audience with a spectre
of methods which are present in a usual assembly work-
ow, starting from raw data and nishing with a fully
assembled genome. We will see how to obtain nucleotide
sequences from raw signals, dive deeper into the most
used assembly paradigm for long fragments, try out and
compare several state-of-the-art assemblers, and at last,
assess the quality of the obtained assembly with and
without a reference genome.

Online MetabarcodingBiodiversity
Jan7-13
*Theory and practice in metabarcoding for biodiversity*
*FREE online workshop*
7th-13th January 2021
www.metagenecol.eu Workshop overview:
Metagenomic methods continue to transform the anal-
ysis of biodiversity and provide exciting possibilities
for studying the vast proportion of 'hidden diversity'
of species hardly known to science. Massive amplicon
datasets can be generated from complex specimen mix-
tures, and simplify studies of the ecology, evolution
and conservation for ever more populations and species
with high accuracy. However, data processing and inter-
pretation require careful application of bioinformatics
pipelines, to generate 'clean' data that reect the true
genetic variants required for use in evolutionary and
ecological modelling. The course will teach the required
bioinformatics and data handling skills, with focus on
the potential of metabarcode sequences as a resource
in biodiversity studies, taxonomy and population ge-
netics. The course will take place fully online using a
exible model of both synchronous and asynchronous
teaching. The course will comprise talks on the theory
of metabarcoding and phylogenetics for metabarcoding,
guided discussion sessions and detailed practical bioin-
formatics training. Synchronous sessions will take place
on the dates 7-8th and 11-12-13th of January 2021 be-
tween 8am and 11am UTC, with support for the guided
practicals available 11am to 5pm UTC.
Instructors:106 EvolDir November 1, 2020
Prof. Alfried P. Vogler (Imperial College London and
the Natural History Museum,UK)
Dr. Thomas J. Creedy (Natural History Museum, UK)
Applications:
The course is aimed at graduate students and early-
career researchers interested in applying accurate
metabarcoding methods to questions about biodiver-
sity and ecology. The course focuses on bioinformatic
methods, so some prior experience with the linux com-
mand line is preferred, although pre-course online study
materials will be available to all attendees to ensure
a common starting point. An understanding of phylo-
genetics would be useful to get the most out of some
sessions. For applications please send a single-page Cur-
riculum Vitae and a short motivation letter (maximum
300 words) to ibiogen.project@gmail.com until the 20th
of November 2020.
This workshop is organised by the iBioGen project <
https://www.ibiogen.eu >funded under the Horizon
2020 Twinning scheme, so participation is completely
free (there are no fees).

This course is structured over 5 days of theoretical and
hands-on training and covers the majority of the con-
cepts and challenges commonly faced when analysing
direct RNA-Seq data. It will start from common tasks
such as data QC and gene expression quantication and
then move on to more advanced topics such as transcrip-
tome assembly, polyA-tail length measurements and
RNA modications detection.
This course is intended for an audience of researchers
with a certain degree of familiarity with RNA sequencing
concepts. While not exclusively directed to attendeeswith bioinformatics training, the majority of the prac-
ticals will make use of command-line tools. Therefore
some experience with a *nix environment (e.g. Linux or
MacOS) and the shell (e.g. Bash) are highly desirable.
Some familiarity with R will also be an advantage.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subjectNovember 1, 2020 EvolDir 109
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
