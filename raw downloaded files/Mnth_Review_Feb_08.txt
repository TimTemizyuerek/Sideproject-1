Website: www.unil.ch/silene The genus Silene is
emerging as a study case for plant evolutionary ecol-
ogy, with current research questions covering among
others local adaptation, sex determination, sex ratio
variation, sexual dimorphism, mating systems, popula-
tion genetics, the epidemiology of fungal diseases and
nursery pollination. The aim of the workshop is to bring
together scientists working on various aspects of the bi-
ology of the genus Silene (and of interacting agents such
as pathogenic fungi and herbivores) for an exchange of
experiences and to initiate and continue collaborativeprojects. The meeting will include invited and con-
tributed talks as well as posters and discussions. The
conference is open to researchers working on Silene,
Mycrobotryum, Hadena, but *we welcome anyone in-
terested in the system, working with related or similar

CALL FOR MENTORS-SMBE UNDERGRADUATE
DIVERSITY MENTORING PROGRAM AWARDS
2008 Annual Meeting of the Society for Molecular Bi-
ology and Evolution June 5-8, Barcelona, Spain http:/-
/www.smbe2008.com PROGRAM OUTLINE
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution
(SMBE) is oﬀering 10 awards to undergraduate stu-
dents from underrepresented groups to participate in
a Diversity Mentoring Program. The goals of this pro-
gram are: (1) to promote diversity at the SMBE annual
meeting, (2) to provide students with the opportunityFebruary 1, 2008 EvolDir 3
to experience the excitement of attending and present-
ing at an international scientiﬁc conference, and (3) to
foster enthusiasm for molecular biology and evolution
as well as a possible career in this ﬁeld.
To achieve these goals, each recipient of an SMBE Un-
dergraduate Diversity Mentoring Program Award will
be paired with two mentors, one a senior graduate stu-
dent and the other a postdoctoral fellow or faculty
member (who may or may not be the student’s cur-
rent advisor). WE ARE SEEKING INDIVIDUALS
INTERESTED IN BEING A MENTOR. Speciﬁc ac-
tivities will include:
. Attending conference sessions with the student, an-
swering questions about the basic concepts being pre-
sented, and, more generally, explaining the ’goings-on’
at a multi-day scientiﬁc conference.
. Interacting with the student during some mealtimes,
coﬀee breaks and other social gatherings.
. Introducing the student to other undergraduates,
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty
members as a way of facilitating connections with po-
tential future graduate supervisors and colleagues.
. Attending the poster session and SBME Undergrad-
uate Diversity Program Award reception with the stu-
dent in order to minimize/overcome the anxiety often
felt by ﬁrst-time conference attendees.
. Serving as a contact point for the student to help
resolve any issues surrounding conference registration,
travel and accommodation.
CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION
In addition to the activities outlined above, mentors
will be invited to attend a special reception / poster
session on Friday June 6, along with undergraduates,
supervisors and other interested conference attendees.
If you are interested in mentoring an undergradu-
ate at this year’s SMBE meeting please email Laura
Katz (Lkatz[at]email.smith.edu) and John Archibald
(john.archibald[at]dal.ca).

Hello!
We are pleased to announce a special session on Evolu-
tion at this year’s C. elegans topic meeting 11-15 June
2008 in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. This symposium will
provide an exceptional opportunity to exchange ideas
and to present current research on the evolutionary
analysis of C. elegans and its congeners, and of com-
parative work with other model nematodes (e.g. Pris-
tionchus, Oscheius, Heterorhabditis). The session is a
sequel to the 2006 C. elegans Evolution Workshop held
in Oeiras, Portugal, that was organized by Henrique
Teotonio, Marie-Anne F´ elix, Patrick Phillips, and Ri-
cardo Azevedo. We are also proud to have Scott Em-
mons as the keynote speaker for the Evolution topic
session.
The session on evolution will cover diverse ﬁelds within
evolutionary biology, including: * comparative evolu-
tionary genetics and genomics * experimental evolu-
tion * ecologically important traits (chemotaxis, learn-
ing, resistance, etc.) * genetic variation: population
and quantitative genetics, gene family evolution * re-
productive biology and sexual selection
In addition, the meeting will also host a Workshop on
Caenorhabditis Evolution with the aim of facilitating
discussion of salient problems in evolutionary biology
through use of C. elegans and its relatives. We intend
the workshop to focus on 3 themes: 1. Understand-
ing diversity in Caenorhabditis: variation in morphol-
ogy, behavior, and sequences 2. Fundamental prob-
lems in evolution to which C. elegans can be applied
3. Synergism and resources for studying evolution in
Caenorhabditis
Other sessions in this year?s C. elegans Development
& Evolution topic meeting will provide a rich comple-
ment of talks relating development and evolution, and
the meeting features an outstanding line-up of keynote
speakers.
Deadline for abstract submission is 7 April 2008 (on-
line registration will commence shortly). For fur-
ther details, see the conference website: http://-
www.union.wisc.edu/celegans/ Best wishes and hope
to see you in Madison!

The rapid growth of genetic sequence data has pro-
vided much-needed power for resolving controversial
species relationships and studying the evolutionary
process, but has also posed many statistical and
computational challenges to the ﬁeld. This meeting
will bring together scientists with a diverse range of
backgrounds, and in particular researchers actively
developing statistical methods and computational
algorithms used in modern phylogenetics software.
Statistical and computational challenges facing the ﬁeld
will be discussed in the meeting, for example, eﬃcient
tree search algorithms under likelihood, Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian phylogenetics, es-
timation of species divergence dates by incorporating
uncertainties in the fossil record and statistical tests of
phylogenies.

Seattle EarlyCareer Female
EvolutionaryBiologists Oct19-22
Dear Colleagues,
We are writing to introduce you to WEBS (Women
Evolving Biological Sciences), an annual three-day sym-
posium aimed at addressing the retention of female sci-
entists and issues related to the transition of women
from early career stages to tenure track positions and
leadership roles in academic and research settings. The
inaugural WEBS symposium in October 2007 was a
huge success. Early career participants as well as our
senior scientist panelists reported feeling inspired and
equipped with new connections and tools that they ex-
pect will help them in their career in the years to come.
WEBS targets early career women in the Biological Sci-February 1, 2008 EvolDir 9
ences with an emphasis on ecology and evolutionary
biology. In particular, it focuses on women who have
earned their doctoral degrees within the past two to
eight years and who do not have tenure in order to ad-
dress the critical transition period from graduate stud-
ies and post-doctoral positions to permanent research
and teaching positions. The symposia provide a forum
for professional development, including awareness and
improvement of academic leadership skills; opportuni-
ties to establish mentoring relationships; and resources
for developing professional networks. The 2008 sympo-
sium will be held at the Pack Forest Conference center
near Seattle, WA from October 19-22, 2008.
Please visit our website ( http://-
www.webs.washington.edu ) for details and appli-
cation materials. Feel free to contact us with any
questions you might have (webs@u.washington.edu).
Applications will be due April 15, 2008.

Slovakia PlantSystematics July
Following a really successful meeting of the In-
ternational Organisation of Plant Biosystematists
(IOPB, now interest group of the International
Association for Plant Taxonomy) in Valencia in
2004 ( www.jardibotanic.org/iopb.html ) the next IOPB
meeting in July 2008 will be held in the Vysoke Tatry
Mts. in Slovakia. The meeting will be devoted to the
Evolution of Plants in Mountainous and Alpine Habi-
tats. We would like to cover a wide span of topics
ranging from the traditional biosystematic studies to
the application of the most advanced molecular tech-
niques addressing evolutionary, phylogenetic, phylogeo-
graphic, ecological and other questions. The idea is to
present the results of studies of the mountain and alpine
ﬂora from diﬀerent parts of the world.
Following the symposium there will be a possibility to
stay for few days in the Vysoke Tatry Mts. and visit
some interesting localities of the mountain and alpine
ﬂora in the Tatry National Park.
The 2008 symposium in the Vysoke Tatry Mts. is
organised by the Institute of Botany of the SlovakAcademy of Sciences, Slovak National Taxonomic Facil-
ity, and the Department of Botany, Charles University
in Prague in cooperation with the International Asso-
ciation for Plant Taxonomy and International Organi-
sation of Plant Biosystematists.
We invite you to take part at this meeting, which will be
an excellent opportunity to become aware of the most
recent developments in the study of the high moun-
tain ﬂora, but also to see interesting examples of the
Carpathian ﬂora just few metres from the symposium
venue.

Winchester ArtiﬁcialLife and
Evolution Aug5-8
Dear Brian,February 1, 2008 EvolDir 11
Presumably you get a lot of this sort of request, but was
wondering whether you would allow us to announce an
upcoming conference on the Evolution Directory? The
conference is ALIFE XI, the 11th International Confer-
ence on Artiﬁcial Life, which some colleagues and I are
organizing for this summer.
As you may know, Artiﬁcial Life investigates the funda-
mental properties of living systems through simulating
and synthesizing biological entities and processes in ar-
tiﬁcial media. As such it engages with many interesting
questions in theoretical biology, evolutionary biology,
ecology, synthetic biology, computational biology, etc.
A general call for participation follows, but some points
of note are:
The conference has some great keynote speak-
ers: Stuart Kauﬀman, Eva Jablonka, Peter Schuster,
Takashi Ikegami and Andrew Ellington, see http://-
www.alifexi.org/keynotes/ It allows for abstract as
well as full paper submission, but with no distinction
in presentation time at the conference (details below).
The organisers are committed to keeping the costs
of registration and accommodation as low as pos-
sible. Details will be available shortly at http://-
www.alifexi.org/registration/ The event will perhaps
be especially beneﬁcial to PhD students who would ben-
eﬁt from exposure to a wider range of biological ideas.
Several themed sessions on biological issues are sched-
uled: microbial systems, major transitions, synthetic
biology, cell signalling, etc. (more details below).
If you see this as an appropriate meeting to be an-
nounced on EvolDir, we’d be very grateful for the help
in publicizing it.
Thanks very much for your time, Jason Noble.

OVERVIEW Artiﬁcial life investigates the fundamen-
tal properties of living systems through simulating and
synthesizing biological entities and processes in artiﬁ-
cial media. Summer 2008 will see the international Alife
conference hosted by the University of Southampton,
UK, bringing the meeting to Europe for the ﬁrst time
in its 21-year history. Over the last two decades, some
of the highly speculative ideas that were discussed at
the ﬁeld’s inception have matured to the extent that
new conferences and journals devoted to them are be-
ing established: synthesising artiﬁcial cells, simulating
massive biological networks, exploiting biological sub-
strates for computation and control, and deploying bio-
inspired engineering are all now cutting-edge practice.
The ALIFE XI conference provides an opportunity for
those working across these topics to get together and
exchange ideas and results. To this end, the confer-
ence will present a selection of the best current work in
the ﬁeld, highlight new directions for investigation, and
present high-proﬁle keynote speakers.
Papers are welcome in all areas of the ﬁeld, including:
* Synthesis and origin of life, self-organization, self-
replication, artiﬁcial chemistries * Evolution and adap-
tation, evolutionary dynamics, evolutionary games, co-
evolution, major evolutionary transitions, levels of se-
lection, ecosystems * Development, diﬀerentiation, and
regulation; generative representations * Synthetic biol-
ogy * Self-organizing technology, self-* computing and
computational ecosystems * Unconventional and bio-
logically inspired computing * Bio-inspired robots and
embodied cognition, autonomous agents, evolutionary
robotics * Collective behaviour, communication, coop-
eration * Artiﬁcial consciousness; the relationship be-
tween life and mind * Philosophical, ethical, and cul-
tural implications * Mathematical and philosophical
foundations of Alife, new and creative syntheses
All authors are encouraged to explain how their work
sheds light on the fundamental properties of living sys-
tems and makes progress on the important open ques-
tions identiﬁed at previous meetings.
Several artiﬁcial life themes have been proposed as live
research

ColoradoStateU SexualSelection
* PhD Student in Evolutionary Sexual Selection *
A graduate student position is available in the lab of
Lisa Angeloni in the Biology Department at Colorado
State University. Motivated students who are inter-
ested in working on mating behavior and sexual selec-
tion in Trinidadian guppies are encouraged to apply.
Guppy populations experience diﬀerent levels of pre-
dation pressure in their natural habitats, which aﬀects
male color patterns, life history strategies and female
preferences for male traits. In collaboration with Dr.
Cameron Ghalambor, we will investigate how repro-
ductive behavior depends on several factors, including
the history of predation in the natural population, the
presence of predator cues during development and the
presence of predator cues during mating. There are
many possible questions to ask with this system, and
the graduate student will have the opportunity to de-
termine the scope of the project.
Graduate students will have the opportunity to partici-pate in the interdisciplinary Graduate Degree Program
in Ecology at CSU. Please send a statement of interest
and a CV or resume including GPA and GRE scores, re-
search experience and research interests by February 11,
2008 to Lisa Angeloni (angeloni@lamar.colostate.edu).
Reference letters for top candidates will be solicited at
a later date. Applications will be reviewed as they come
in and may also be reviewed after the target date if the
position has not been ﬁlled.

HostParasiteInteractions
Eawag is the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science
and Technology, a Swiss-based and internationally op-
erating aquatic research institute within the ETH do-
main.
The Department Aquatic Ecology (groups of Piet
Spaak, respectively Bas Ibelings) seeks for
2 PhD students in evolution of host-parasite interac-
tions
The PhD students will participate in a collabora-
tive research project GEDIHAP with host-parasite re-
searchers from the ETH Z¨ urich and the Swiss Fed-
eral Institute for Forest Snow and Landscape Research,
WSL, to study the inﬂuence of environmental factors
(natural and human induced) on host - parasite inter-
actions. In the ﬁrst project a hybrid Daphnia species
complex and its parasites are studied. We are interested
in the population genetics of the host as well as of the
parasite. Experimentally genotype (host) x genotype
(parasite) x environment interactions will be studied.
In the second project the impact of 2 environmental
stress factors (climate change and water pollution) on
the co-evolution of the diatom Asterionella formosa and
parasitic chytrid fungi is studied.
For this, from CCESS (Competence Center Environ-
ment and Sustainability of the ETH Domain) ﬁnanced
project, we are looking for 2 highly motivated candi-
dates with interests in evolutionary biology, population
genetics and host-parasite interactions. Although ﬁeld
work is also involved, most of the work will be done
in the lab (conducting experiments and screening hosts
and parasites using molecular tools). Some of the work
will be done in Germany (Daphnia) and the Nether-
lands (Asterionella).
We oﬀer a stimulating research environment in a lively
and social institute in D¨ ubendorf (near Z¨ urich). In a
department with several other evolutionary and eco-
logical research groups with a focus on host parasite
interaction. Both PhD candidates will be actively in-
volved in workshops and courses organized within the
GEDIHAP framework. The position will be for a pe-
riod of three years, and should start as soon as possible
(April 2008 or soon thereafter). The ideal candidate
has both experimental as well as molecular skills (PCR,sequencing, genotyping). A Diploma or Master degree
(or equivalent) in biology or related subject is neces-
sary for admission. The working language in the group
is English.
Applications should include a letter of interest with a
description of pertinent experience, curriculum vitae,
a list of publications (if any), the names (with e-mail
address) of two potential reviewers, and copies of the
certiﬁcates of academic qualiﬁcations.

temperature in turtles with alternative sex determin-
ing mechanisms. The position is part of an NSF-funded
project in the laboratory of Nicole Valenzuela, Depart-
ment of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology,
Iowa State University. The project calls for ﬁeld and
laboratory developmental experiments to help elucidate
the eﬀect that naturally-ﬂuctuating temperature has on
the expression of genes involved in gonadal formation
in turtles with temperature-dependent and genotypic
sex determination, and how males and females are pro-
duced in nature. For additional information concern-
ing this and other research projects, please refer to the

Evolution of Sex Diﬀerences in Recombination Rates
One doctoral student position is available for a moti-
vated individual to study the evolution of behavior in
the Biological Sciences Department at Kent State Uni-
versity in Ohio.
The project will focus on the evolution of sex-diﬀerences
in recombination rates on autosomes using Drosophila
ananassae as a model system (see my web page for back-
ground) and will involve lab work (including molecular
genetics and immunostain-based cytology) and some
theory: - Quantitative PCR will be used to measure
sex-diﬀerences in expression of genes known to aﬀect
recombination in females. - This will involve primer de-
sign for candidate genes. - Immunostaining techniques
will be developed to show the centromere, synaptone-
mal complex and cross-over events in D. ananassae mei-
otic cells. - Models for how sex diﬀerences in recombi-
nation rates can evolve will be developed. - Predic-
tions from several hypotheses will be tested including
the hypothesis that sexual selection causes the observed
sex-diﬀerences in recombination rates.
Previous experience in animal behavior, with
Drosophila, and/or with molecular techniques or
immunostaining would be an asset; a strong interest in
evolution and behavior is required.
Position will remain open until ﬁlled.

the pathogens are still largely unknown. The student
will work in the context of host-parasite co-evolution
by combining ﬁeld work and experiments depending on
his/her interests. The candidate is encouraged to cre-
ate and develop his/her own project in the mentioned
area. Good aptitude for ﬁeldwork, molecular ecology
skills and especially population genetics basics are ex-

Graduate Assistantships (M.Sc. or Ph.D.) are avail-
able in the labs of Iliana Baums and Todd LaJeunesse
at the Pennsylvania State University in the areas of
marine ecology and evolution. Prospective candidates
should have strong academic records and some research
experience is preferred. In addition to laboratory bench
work, periodic ﬁeld expeditions are an important part
of our research and involve collecting and experimental
work using SCUBA often in remote locations. Motiva-
tion, self-discipline, creativity, and good interpersonal
skills are essential.
Baums and her students work on dispersal, connectiv-
ity and reproductive biology of marine organisms, with
a focus on tropical corals. Molecular tools are used
to address ecological and evolutionary questions with
conservation applications. Currently, we are studying
the eﬀects of climate change on dispersal in corals and
other reef taxa. Research on conservation genetics of
elkhorn corals in the Caribbean includes quantiﬁca-
tion of heritable genetic variation and the role of asex-
ual reproduction. ( http://www.bio.psu.edu/people/-
faculty/baums/Index.htm .)
LaJeunesse and his students work primarily on the ecol-
ogy and evolution of endosymbiotic microbes. Research
is currently focused on a diverse group of photosyn-
thetic dinoﬂagellates that live in the tissues of corals
and related taxa. Molecular approaches are utilized to
investigate the biodiversity, host-symbiont speciﬁcity,
and geographic distributions in order to address ques-
tions related to co- evolutionary processes and to learn
how these systems respond to severe environmental
change.

Studentship in Systems Biology
Gene and protein networks related to breast cancer
Systems biology is a growing area, combining modelling
and computational analysis with biological experimen-
tation. It enables us to understand biological processes
on a broad-scale like never before: for example, in-
stead of analysing a gene or its protein in isolation, we
now analyse entire networks. Such systems level under-
standing impacts research in multiple areas, including
cancer biology.February 1, 2008 EvolDir 17
In this studentship, you will examine gene and protein
regulatory networks related to breast cancer. You will
both build computational models and perform biolog-
ical experiments. The project will lever two systems
biology methods-dynamical systems modelling (DSM)
of large cellular networks and Bayesian network (BN)
inference of network structure-to produce data-driven
models of gene and protein regulation networks rel-
evant to breast cancer. DSM handles well the spar-
sity of data; however, networks are manually described
and uniqueness is diﬃcult to verify. BNs complement
this by recovering network structure de novo from data
and predicting several alternative structures; however,
they have high data demands. You will use these two
complementary methods to suggest structures consis-
tent with the data and to identify the key experiments
required to discriminate between alternative solutions.
You will be based at St Andrews University and jointly
supervised by Dr V Anne Smith (St Andrews), Prof
John W Crawford (Abertay), and Prof David J Har-
rison (Edinburgh). Dr Smith will provide expertise
on BNs; Prof Crawford and Prof Harrsion will pro-
vide expertise on DSM and biological experimenta-
tion respectively. As a SULSA Student, you will
also have the opportunity to engage in the SULSA
(Scottish Universities Life Science Alliance) commu-
nity across Scotland, including meetings with other
SULSA Students. For more details, please contact

Conservation/Landscape Genetics of North American
Carnivores
I will have positions available for MSc and/or PhD can-
didates to investigate the conservation/landscape ge-
netics of North American carnivores, primarily focusing
on North American black bears, but with opportunities
to investigate other species.18 EvolDir February 1, 2008
Resolving the underlying factors inﬂuencing the move-
ment of animals and genetic variation across complex
landscapes is critical to understanding their ecology,
evolution, eﬀective conservation and management. Us-
ing a landscape genetics approach, correlations between
genetic discontinuities (gene ﬂow or local adaptation)
with landscape and environmental features (mountains,
lakes, road systems) can be revealed. New statisti-
cal and analytical tools are now emerging to enhance
our understanding of the distribution of genetic vari-
ation on ﬁner scales and statistically test hypotheses
(e.g. quantify barrier eﬀects of roads/unsuitable habi-
tat and certain forestry practices) using detailed GIS-
based geographical and environmental data, along with
high-resolution molecular markers. Black bears are har-
vested for sport, food, fur, and other derivatives (bones,
urine, and gall for traditional medicines). It is not al-
ways clear how many animals, and from what popula-
tions, we can harvest in a sustainable manner. This
project involves using DNA proﬁling to deﬁne popula-
tions and non-invasively census black bears using baited
hair-traps. These same data will be applied to further
our understanding of black bear ecology through land-
scape genetics and enhance DNA databanks to enforce
wildlife laws in illegal harvest and trade.

Coevolutionary Mechanisms in Pathogen/Vector Com-
plexes
I will have positions available for MSc and/or PhD can-
didates to investigate coevolutionary mechanisms using
the raccoon rabies virus and its vectors as a model sys-
tem.
The dynamic interaction between species and their
pathogens plays a pivotal role in their adaptation, evo-
lution, and persistence. Conventional belief suggests
that rabies is a lethal disease with no potential for evo-
lution within its hosts. Disease challenge and vacci-
nation experiments, however, indicate that variability
exists in the immune response of raccoons to rabies.
This project will involve an investigation of selective
responses of raccoons to rabies via genes that are in-
timately associated with the initiation of an immune
response and studied in relation to the absence, pres-
ence and duration of rabies exposure. These data will
be used to empirically test theories of balancing selec-
tion, frequency-based selection, the geographic mosaic
theory of co-evolution, and contribute to our under-
standing of mechanisms involved in disease spread and
maintenance.

UBath BacterialORFans
Bioinformatics PhD available on bacterial “ORFans”
This is a collaborative project supervised jointly by Dr
Edward Feil (University of Bath, UK), and Dr Dawn
Field (University of Oxford, UK).
Our collection of genomes and metagenomes continues
to grow at an increasing pace. These data provide great
potential for understanding both evolutionary and eco-
logical processes, but new software tools and statistical
approaches are required to manage and to fully exploit
the datasets. Each newly sequenced genome reveals
a number of previously unkown genes ( ?ORFans?).
These genes are likely to be of central importance to
bacterial adaptation, yet they remain largely under-
studied. You will join the microbial adaptation group
led by Dr Ed Feil at the University of Bath, and the
evolutionary bioinformatics group at CEH Oxford led
by Dawn Field, to further develop comparative genomic
software to understand the evolutionary signiﬁcance of
newly identiﬁed hypothetical gene sequences. It is in-
visaged that most of your time will be spent in Oxford.
You will use your programming and database skills to
extend the current infrastructure, including the provi-
sion of a public web server from cached and uploaded
data sets.In addition to gaining extensive bioinformat-
ics expertise, the project will also involve a strong ap-
preciation of bacterial population biology and micro-
evolution. In undertaking these studies you will work
with a range of existing collaborators in the USA and
Europe and build new suitable collaborations in the
course of your PhD research.20 EvolDir February 1, 2008
This project has funding associatated with it. It is a
4-year studentship. Eligible candidates are UK or EU
applicants, who have been resident in the UK for at
least the 3 years prior to the start of the research pro-
gramme.
It is envisaged that this studentship will start in early
2008.

UFlorida LifeHistoryEvolution
Are you interested in understanding the mechanisms
underlying adaptive life history evolution and pheno-
typic plasticity? I am currently seeking graduate stu-
dents to join our research group at the University of
Florida. We take an integrative approach to under-
standing life history plasticity and life cycle evolution
in insects that includes combining analyses of costs and
beneﬁts, organismal and cellular physiology, molecular
genetics, and population genetics. Examples of possible
projects include:
1) Mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in insect hiber-
nation/diapause (combining organismal biology, physi-
ology, microarray genomics, and high-throughput pro-
teomics)
2) Consequences of body size and nutrient storage on
the costs and beneﬁts of diapause.
3) Physiology of reproductive plasticity including iden-
tifying and testing candidate molecules and pathways
for the control of reproductive timing and allotment
and diapause.
4) Evolution of diapause strategies and the role of dia-
pause strategies in diversiﬁcation and speciation.
A possible project would be to study the physiologi-
cal basis of adaptive shifts in life history timing in the
apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella R. pomonella is a
model system for studying the evolution of insect-host
plant associations and sympatric speciation. (yes, the
one from all the textbooks!) Historically, R. pomonella
larvae fed on the fruits of hawthorns (Crataegus sp.)
but radiated onto domesticated apple (Malus pumila)
after its introduction to North America. In areas where
both hosts occur, apple and hawthorn populations form
genetically distinguishable host races. The timing anddepth of diapause (overwintering dormancy) are criti-
cal life-history traits diﬀerentially adapting apple and
hawthorn-infesting populations of R. pomonella to dif-
ferences in the fruiting times of their respective hosts,
generating reproductive isolation in the process. Phys-
iological traits such as nutrient storage and metabolic
rate aﬀect diapause length and timing in other insects.
We will test the hypothesis that adaptive diﬀerences in
diapause length between the apple and hawthorn host
races are mediated by energetics, particularly the ac-
cumulation of metabolic fuel prior to diapause and its
utilization during diapause.
We will determine the functional importance of nutrient
storage and metabolism to diapause length and timing
for apple and hawthorn host races of R. pomonella in
the ﬁeld and lab; and then equate any observed dif-
ference in fuel storage, body size, and metabolic rate
with allelic variation at loci that have diverged between
the host races. Linking allele frequencies to diapause-
associated nutrient storage and metabolism will provide
the basis for our ultimate goal of identifying the speciﬁc
physiological, biochemical, and genetic alterations un-
derlying adaptive host plant-mediated life history evo-
lution in the two R. pomonella host races.
Additional projects could include addressing similar
questions about plasticity in diapause responses and the
physiological basis of costs of diapause on reproduction
and dispersal in ﬂesh ﬂies.
The student would join Dan Hahn’s group in the De-
partment of Entomology and Nematology at the Uni-
versity of Florida ( http://danhahn.ifas.uﬂ.edu/ ) and
will have signiﬁcant interactions with Jeﬀ Feder’s group
in the Department of Biological Sciences at Notre Dame

ments in the medical school, and more. Tuition, health

DNA to start in May or September 2008. Some ex-
perience in the use of molecular techniques is desir-
able. Interested students should contact Teresa Crease
at tcrease@uoguelph.ca. Additional information about
the Zoology graduate program at the University of
Guelph can be found at http://www.uoguelph.ca/ib/-
graduate zoology2.shtml . A description of my research
interests is provided below.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is an important multigene
family that codes for the structural RNA molecules
that make up ribosomes. One unit of rDNA consists
of 3 genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA) separated
by intergenic spacers. The spacers contain sequences
that control the expression of the rRNA genes. Some
regions of these genes evolve very slowly while other re-
gions, known as expansion segments, and the intergenic
spacers evolve very rapidly. Despite this rapid evolution
in their sequence, they still maintain their function. In
addition, it has been observed that sequence similar-
ity among the members of this multigene family is high
within species relative to similarity between copies from
diﬀerent species. This phenomenon is known as CON-
CERTED EVOLUTION.
Due to variation in the rate of evolution in diﬀerent
parts of the same repeat unit, rDNA is an excellent
model system with which to study the interaction be-
tween the molecular processes that cause concerted evo-
lution, and natural selection to maintain the structure
and function of the molecule. I use freshwater crus-
taceans in the genus Daphnia as a model organism
for this work as they contain unusually long expansion
segments, and show variation in breeding system with
some populations reproducing by cyclical and others by
obligate parthenogenesis.
The current goals of my research program are to:
1) identify proteins that bind to the ribosomal inter-
genic spacer, and determine the impact of intra- and
interspeciﬁc variation on the interaction between this
sequence and these proteins
2) determine the impact of breeding system and ge-
nomic location on the evolution of a Daphnia transpo-
son, Pokey, that is found both inside and outside of therDNA.
3) test the hypothesis that rates of recombination and
rDNA copy number diﬀer between Daphnia species,
and thus cause diﬀerences in their rates of concerted
evolution
4) test the hypothesis that natural selection is acting on
rRNA gene expansion segment length variation within
species

ULausanne EvolutionSymbiosis
PhD studentships in Lausanne: Evolution & Symbiosis
We are seeking several highly motivated students with
an interest in molecular biology and/or evolutionary
ecology to join our group working on symbiotic my-
corrhizal fungi. These important fungi form mutu-
alistic symbioses with most plants, improving plant
growth and inﬂuencing diversity of ecosystems. Al-
though the fungi grow clonally, they have a highly un-
usual genome organization, harbouring genetically dif-
ferent nuclei that are passed from one generation to the
next (see Hijri & Sanders, Nature 2005; Kuhn, Hijri &
Sanders, Nature 2001). The main goals of our research
are to understand how selection, drift, genetic exchange
and recombination act on these fungi and how this can
be used to create more beneﬁcial strains of the fungi
for use in sustainable agriculture.
A selection of possible projects include: - Stabil-
ity/heritability of fungal traits associated with im-
proved growth of rice - Population genetics of mycor-
rhizal fungi in natural or agricultural systems - Linking
quantitative changes in genetically diﬀerent nuclei with
important phenotypic traits - Exploring natural varia-
tion in mycorrhizal fungal populations for improvement
of plant growth
The candidate should be familiar with molecular biol-
ogy and have an interest in applying this knowledge
to evolutionary & ecological questions. He/she should
also be willing to interact with the other group mem-
bers working on evolution and population biology of
mycorrhizal fungi (see list of recent papers on our web
site).The successful candidate must have a Masters degree
(MSc) in order to qualify for our PhD program. We are
located in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at
the University of Lausanne (Switzerland). The Dept.
of Ecology and Evolution in Lausanne is situated on the
shores of Lake Geneva and provides a pleasant & excit-
ing research environment and a strong PhD program.
It is also one of the largest institutions in Europe for
research in ecology and evolutionary biology, compris-
ing 17 diﬀerent research groups. A genomics research
centre also exists at the same site.
The studentships are for a period of 3 years. Start-
ing date ideally by late spring 2008 but this date can
be extended for exceptional candidates. Closing date
for application is 28 February 2008. To apply, appli-
cants should send a CV plus a letter of motivation
by EMAIL to Ian Sanders, Dept of Ecology and Evo-
lution, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Email:

UNottingham SticklebackSpeciation
Speciation in three-spined sticklebacks.
Funding may be available, on a within department com-
petitive basis, for a PhD studentship to investigate the
relative importance of diﬀerent ecological factors in the
divergence and speciation of three-spined sticklebacks.
Speciation can be viewed as the evolution of reproduc-
tive isolation between related taxa. Recent research
has begun to investigate the ecological conditions that
favour selection for reproductive isolation as well its
genetic basis. This project will investigate the relative
importance of diﬀerent sources of reproductive isolation
in speciation in three-spined sticklebacks.
On the island of North Uist in the Scottish Outer
Hebrides three-spined sticklebacks occur as isolated
freshwater populations, freshwater populations that hy-
bridise with marine three spined sticklebacks in deﬁned
hybrid zones, sympatric, isolated population pairs of
marine and freshwater ’species’ and collapsed ’hybrid
swarms’. This project will use this natural variation
and combine ﬁeld work, lab based mate choice tests and
molecular genetics to explore the relative importance
of diﬀerent pre- and post-mating isolating mechanisms
during stickleback divergence and speciation.
Applicants should have a good degree in a relevant sub-February 1, 2008 EvolDir 25
ject, and an interest and enthusiasm for evolutionary
ecology. Previous ﬁeld work experience and a full driv-
ing licence would be beneﬁcial but are not required.
Prospective students should, as soon as pos-
sible, send a CV and a one page outline of
how they would tackle the project to Andrew

PHD STUDENTSHIP (with funding for EU citizens)
SOCIAL EVOLUTION AND VIRULENCE Supervi-
sors: Sam Brown and Angus Buckling, Oxford Univer-
sity
Here’s the advertisement (to appear in New Sci-
entist, and available at http://www.ﬁndaphd.com/-
search/showproject.asp?projectid=16130 ). If you’re
interested, please ﬁrst get in touch with me
(sam.brown@zoo.ox.ac.uk) as soon as possible. I’m
happy to discuss any questions about possible research
topics and the application process.
Simultaneous selection on multiple microbial social
traits and the evolution of virulence
Microbes have complex social lives, both cooperating
and acting spitefully. For example, bacteria produce
numerous “public goods” (shared resources that are re-
leased into the environment), such as iron-scavenging
siderophores and glue that coats surface dwelling bac-
teria to form a resistant “bioﬁlm”; as well as produc-
ing anti-competitor toxins (bacteriocins). Recent the-
oretical and empirical studies have provided key in-
sights into the ecological conditions under which diﬀer-
ent social behaviours evolve, and how these behaviours
may aﬀect the severity of microbial infections. Despite
this progress, our understanding of microbial social be-26 EvolDir February 1, 2008
haviours has to date been limited by the study of single
social traits in isolation. Microbes, however, typically
perform multiple social behaviours simultaneously. For
example, a cooperative behaviour may be directed to-
wards some individuals, whereas a spiteful behaviour
may be simultaneously directed towards others.
Here we propose to theoretically address how natural
selection acts on multiple social traits simultaneously,
and the consequences of this for disease virulence (the
damage caused to hosts by pathogens). The theory will
be developed in close conjunction with an experimen-
tal program led by Angus Buckling, using the highly
social, opportunistic animal and plant pathogen, Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa, as a study organism.

ConsGenet
Field technicians needed from approximately mid-
March to late June 2008 (dates somewhat ﬂexible; to-
tal position duration about 16 weeks) to participate in
a stress ecophysiology project on two federally endan-
gered species, the Black-capped Vireo and the Golden-
Cheeked Warbler. The research is a collaboration
among investigators at Princeton University, Tufts Uni-
versity, and University of Illinois. The Princeton group
uses heart rate telemetry to study the metabolic de-
mands of stress induced by human and military activ-
ity. The Tufts group studies the hormonal response
to short- and long-term exposure to disturbance. Work
takes place at Fort Hood, a beautiful 88,000-ha military
installation adjacent to the city of Killeen, Texas. And,
yes! It is beautiful! The base is home to many endemic
insects, and also to bobcats and mountain lions not to
mention tons of birds. Primary tasks of crew mem-
bers will be to locate adult birds on their territories,
map territories, ﬁnd nests, and assist in targeted mist-
netting, transmitter mounting, blood sampling, nest
monitoring, behavioral observations, and various other
activities related to ﬁeld experiments on birds. Crew
members will be responsible for keeping extensive, de-
tailed ﬁeld notes. Pay is approximately $2,100/month
and workers must provide their own housing and trans-
portation to work (vehicle provided for ﬁeld work). Ap-
plicants must be at least 21 years old by date of hire,
have a valid driver’s license, and a good driving record.
Applicants must have good hearing, be able to see the
full spectrum of colors, and be in suﬃcient physical
condition to carry gear long-distances, cross-country,
in hot and humid weather. Although Fort Hood oﬀers
a great wildlife experience, crews will start work be-
fore sunrise, walk many kilometers, and endure harsh
ﬁeld conditions including exposure to intense sun, heat,
chiggers, ﬁre ants, cactus, snakes, and abundant poison
ivy. Preferred qualiﬁcations are: (1) a 4-year degree in a
life science, or equivalent experience (2) ﬁeld experience
in ﬁnding nests, determining color band combinations
from a distance, identifying birds by sight and sound,
and mist-netting (experience with our study species not
especially important) (3) self-motivation and ability to
work independently and a willingness to learn new skills
(4) ﬂexibility to daily changes in activities and assign-
ments as experiments progress (5) ability to navigate30 EvolDir February 1, 2008

BehaviouralEvolution
Field assistants in Behavioural Evolution
Four ﬁeld assistant positions are available in an inter-
national research project on communication and be-
havioural evolution in nightingales (Luscinia megarhyn-
chos).
Fieldwork will be done in April and May 2008 at the
Research Station Petite Camargue Alsacienne in France
(www.camargue.unibas.ch ). The project is run by Dr.
Valentin Amrhein (University of Basel, Switzerland)
and Prof. Dr. Marc Naguib (Centre for Terrestrial
Evolution, Heteren, Netherlands).
To investigate vocal communication strategies of
nightingales, we record songs (including nocturnal
song) and conduct playback experiments. The ﬁeld as-
sistants will also participate in systematic surveys of
territory settlement and singing activity, and assist in
capturing and banding the birds.
The ﬁeld site is situated at the Petite Camargue Alsa-
cienne in France, about 10 km north of Basel (Switzer-
land). We cannot cover travel expenses, but we oﬀer
free accommodation and use of the infrastructure at
the research station. Field assistants will receive 400
Euros to cover living expenses.
Field assistants are expected to stay for the entire ﬁeld
season from 7 April to the end of May 2008. Field work
will be demanding, and we will use bicycles to visit ev-
ery nightingale territory on two extensive census roundsper day at midnight and at dawn, respectively. Field as-
sistants are expected to work on their own at night and
thus should love working in dark and lonesome places
only accompanied by singing nightingales.
The language at the research station will be English.
Please send applications by email to the following ad-
dress:
pca.recherche@orange.fr
Applications should be in English and should include,
in one single pdf or word ﬁle, a curriculum vitae and
a letter of motivation. Please give names and email
addresses of two persons who are willing to write a let-
ter of recommendation. Applications received before 15
February 2008 will be given full consideration.

Dear colleagues, A call is open until March 20th, for
a position of researcher in Ecosur, southern Mexico.
The research topics are the *population genetics and
molecular phylogeny of tropical bees*. Please ﬁnd a
short description below, and for the complete call, re-
fer to the following web page: - in English: http:/-
/www.ecosur.mx/convocatorias/bees.html - in Span-
ish:http://www.ecosur.mx/convocatorias/abejas.html
I would appreciate your help in forwarding this infor-
mation to potentially interested persons - and I am
sorry if you receive this information through diﬀerent
distribution lists. Best to all, Remy Vandame (rvan-
dame@ecosur.mx) Bee research line El Colegio de la
Frontera Sur—–
Southern Mexico and Central America is a particularly
interesting region for tropical bee research. This region
has been invaded by Africanized bees and possesses a
great natural diversity of bees, in particular stingless
and bumble bees. Despite this high diversity, few stud-
ies have been conducted to determine the existing ge-
netic diversity, the evolutionary pathways followed by
bees and the development of sociality. The conservation
biology of endemic species also remains poorly studied.
The present call is published with the aim of hiring a
researcher with a strong background in population ge-
netics and social insects biology, who will seek among
other objectives, to: - describe and explain the biodi-
versity of tropical bees, with ﬁeld based methodology
as well as laboratory methods, in particular based on
population genetic approaches; - conduct research on
the phylogeny of bees, in particular of groups like stin-
gless and bumble bees; - use such data to explain the
evolution of sociality and behavior such as communica-
tion; - establish and participate in the implementation
of protection strategies for endemic species threatened
with extinction, possibly based on an agroecological ap-
proaches.

I am seeking enthusiastic volunteers interested in as-
sisting a ﬁeld study in Bern, Switzerland. The research
aims to study the eﬀects of diﬀerent avian predators
on life-history traits of Great tits, and the interactions
they might have with ectoparasites of the tits. The tits
are a good system to examine the eﬀects of diﬀerent
predators and ectoparasites since, being hole nesting
birds, the risks the birds face as nestlings are diﬀerent
than those they face once they ﬂedge. I will require 2
ﬁeld assistants that will help with all the aspects of the
work, including ringing the birds, simulating predators,
conducting behavioral observations and recordings, and
more. The study will take place in the forest near Bern
starting roughly at the end of March 2008 and running
until about the end of May 2008. Applicants with a
BSc/Msc in Biology/Ecology and with bird handling
experience would have an advantage. However, moti-
vation will play a key role: the work is hard and de-
manding, may take place in changing weather and re-
quires long hours at times. Motivated applicants could
develop their own individual research on a topic re-
lated to the program and their own interests, and if
particularly motivated could be involved in the pub-
lications. Accommodation and transportation within
Europe may be provided. Some ﬁnancial assistance
may also be available to cover living expenses on a

tion in Human Population Genetics
A programmer analyst position is available in a human
population genetics laboratory aﬃliated with the De-
partments of Genetics and Biology at the University
of Pennsylvania. Projects in the lab focus on a unique
resource of DNA samples and phenotype data from eth-
nically and geographically diverse African populations.
These samples are being used for genome-level analyses
of diversity at both coding and non-coding loci (includ-
ing high throughput resequencing, CNV analyses, and
whole genome SNP genotyping). For many of these
samples we also have phenotype data for a number of
traits that are likely important in adaptation and dis-
ease. We are using these data (1) to infer population
structure and demographic history and to test models
of modern human evolution (2) to identify regions of the
genome that are targets of selection (3) to identify func-
tionally signiﬁcant variants using genotype/phenotype
association studies as well as gene expression analy-
ses (4) to study genetic and phenotypic variation at
loci that inﬂuence drug metabolism and (5) to study
the genetic basis of resistance against infectious dis-
ease (with a focus on malaria) and co-evolution of the
human and Plasmodium falciparum genomes. Collabo-
rators on these projects include Philip Awadalla, Car-
los Bustamante, Junhyong Kim, Gil McVean, Joshua
Plotkin, Jonathan Pritchard, Anna Tramontano, and
Greg Wray. Additional information about the Tishkoﬀ

I hope that everyone is oﬀ to a great start in this new

with the deepest understanding of evolution by natural
selection (though Darwin’s political clout was certainly
essential to the acceptance of their theory).
All the best. Cam

Bovine semen DNA
Dear EvolDirs,
I am going to extract and purify DNA from Bovine se-
men (e.g sperm) preserved at -20C in a well-composed
suspending medium (named mestruum). The number
of samples I need for the experiments is more than 1800,
so in order to save time, money and work, I’m looking
for a DNA extraction kit in 96-wells plates instead of a
single columns one. I have already tested the following
commercial kit, but with NO appreciable results (none
or very, very low amount of DNA!!!!!):
-NucleoSpin Blood Quick Pure (manufacturer:
Macherey Nagel).
-NucleoSpin Tissue (protocol modiﬁed for semen as sug-
gested by the manufacturer: Macherey Nagel).
-BioFab research blood extraction kit.
I did not consider to use Qiagen, because the proto-
col requires the use of an expensive centrifuge from the
manufacturer.
The minimum amount of DNA I need to get from any
sample is 5 microgram in 50 or 100 microliters of elution
buﬀer.
I guess the problem (low or none DNA yield) could be in
the suspending medium (mestruum) in general a high
concentrated solution of polysaccharides that could in-
terfere with some steps in the extraction protocol (e.g.
DNA binding to the column). I even tried to centrifuge
the sample before starting the puriﬁcation in order to
separate the medium (surnatant) from the semen (pel-
let), but it didn’t work!
Do anyone experienced the same problems?
Do anyone have any idea of a good commercial kit
useful for my purposes (96-wells plates, minimum of
5 microgram, getting rid of suspending medium inter-
ference.)?
Any suggestion is appreciated!
Thanks a lot

Drosophila MortalityProblems
Dear all,
I’d like to call for advice or suggestions from people of
the Evoldir community who have encountered mortality
issues in Drosophila lines.
Six months ago, the Drosophila pseudoobscura popula-
tions raised in my lab have suddenly shown high levels
of mortality (80-90%), when the ﬂies are 5-6 day old,
particularly males. The ﬂies that are still alive in the
bottles look normal and have subsequent normal sur-
vival, although they seem to be a bit less productive.
The problem has persisted despite trying several diﬀer-
ent procedures:
1) The room where the ﬂies are handled was thoroughly
cleaned (with dilute bleach and 90% ethanol) several
days in succession and much of our equipment (plas-
ticware, yeast etc.) was replaced.
2) An experiment was carried out to determine if the
food was hosting some microorganism that could be the
cause of the infection. This involved raising males and
females separately on 3 diﬀerent types of food medium;
normal (cornmeal molasses medium), sugar agar or a
potato based medium. Flies were transferred to fresh
vials of the appropriate medium every day for around
10-14 days. The vials were then observed to see if any-
thing grew on these substrates; it was assumed we could
detect any microorganism present in the food. There
was no obvious presence of a microorganism growing on
any substrate and the survival of the ﬂies did not diﬀer
according to which substrate they were kept on.3) Finally, an antibiotic treatment (0.025% tetracy-
cline) was introduced to the food. Flies cultured on this
substrate were less productive and pupated faster than
those on normal food. The oﬀspring of the treated gen-
eration survived normally for one generation. Unfor-
tunately, the following generation again displayed the
same symptoms of mass mortality at 5 days old. I have
contacted companies that can identify microorganisms
and suggest treatments but they were not able to re-
spond our queries.
I would be really grateful if anyone has any suggestions
on other procedures that I could undertake or who to
contact who would be able to suggest solutions to de-
termine the problem. Thanks!

Fs Batch Software
Dear Colleagues,
I am looking for software that will calculate Fu’s Fs
statistic, and that can be run in batch mode (making it
possible to analyze many simulated data sets without
need for user input). Ideally, I would like something
that runs in UNIX and will accept Phylip, Nexus, or
FASTA formatted data ﬁles. Any suggestions would be
most appreciated.
Best regards,
Chris Smith.

F statistic sample size answers
Thanks to everyone who responded to my question
“Sample size calculation for ’F’ statistics”.
For your interest, I append the original question and
copies of all responses.
***** original question *****
I want to look at parasites in a number of separate hosts
to check for non-random breeding within hosts. Ob-
viously there will be diﬀerences in genotypes between
hosts (Fst) and non-random mating would show up as
a signiﬁcant Fis value. The problem is what sample size
would I need to detect a given value of Fis? It looks
like most people avoid the issue of sample size or power
calculations when doing F statistics. The best recent
one I could come up with is
N. Patterson, A. L. Price, and D. Reich. Population
structure and eigenanalysis. Plos Genetics 2 (12):2074-
2093, 2006.
They present calculations for Fst between two popu-
lations and state that the minimum Fst that can be
reasonable detected is 1/sqrt(nm) where n is no of indi-
viduals and m is no. of molecular markers. Would it be
outrageous to extrapolate this to Fis so that, for exam-
ple, examining parasites from 100 animals would have
power to detect a minimum Fis of 1/sqrt(100)=0.1?
*****
Responses (in chronological order of receipt) were as
follows:
*****
>From Adam Porter
The thing about power in F-statistical analyses is that
the error variance depends on allele frequencies, in ad-
dition to the number of loci and populations (& scoring
error). Frequencies near 1/2 give the highest power; if
you’re dealing with rare alleles, you need a lot more in-
dividuals to get the same insight. So, you have to make
assumptions about the distribution of allele frequencies,
which entails accounting for multiple and varying num-
bers of alleles at diﬀerent loci. Another potential source
of variation, in host-parasite cases with few founders
and very high rates of increase: you might get stochas-
ticity in mating patterns that could produce transient
inbreeding or outbreeding patterns within a single host;this would be problematic only if you measure the oﬀ-
spring from the ﬁrst generation, but it would require
sampling from more hosts regardless of numbers of in-
dividuals or loci.
Given the array of variance sources, personally I would
try to simulate the process, varying the true inbreeding
parameter and sampling regime, to see what variance I
got. The simulation is pretty straightforward, since you
can calculate the expected genotype frequencies as de-
viations from Hardy-Weinberg, then sample from those
and recalculate the statistic. It should be possible to
get a decent idea using a spreadsheet.
*****
>From Peter Smouse, (I can forward the pdfs on
request- Ian)
this is the sort of question people asked of breeding
designs in Quantitative Genetics. I am attaching two
*.pdf of our own papers. The equation (in the ﬁrst
TwoGener paper) you want to look at is # (10), and
the translation would be Phi-ft becomes Fst. In the
second paper, we pick the argument apart a bit more,
because there are design issues. You should look at
Falconer, re the variance of an intra-class correlation,
and you should track it back to its original source. Try
Falconer and Mackay (the most up to date version of
the book), and in a pinch, get in touch with Trudy
Mackay. She’ll be able to guide your eﬀorts. Note that
the number of loci does not (for that treatment) come
into the argument, but then Falconer was talking about
pedigree relationships and groupings, where we are av-
eraging over a very large number of loci, not assaying
particular groups of convenient genetic marker loci. Fst
and Fis are going to be a little trickier, because there
is extra replication involved. Good luck with it. PS,
John Nason recently asked me a similar question, so he
is probably working on it as well.
*****>From Rodney J. Dyer.
In a perfect world the assumptions behind the
1/sqrt {nm}would hold up, but unfortunately, we do
not live in such a world. As a result, IMHO the best ap-
proach would be to subsample your data set as you go to
ﬁnd out when the variance of your estimator stabilizes.
We did this in Dyer, RJ and VL Sork. 2001. Pollen
Pool Heterogeneity in Shortleaf Pine, /Pinus echinata/
Mill. /Molecular Ecology/ 10: 859-866. It will work
the same for you for Fis. You may also want to think
about the Ayers&Balding estimators for the distribu-
tion of inbreeding rather than point estimates (Fis is in
general non-symmetric).

>From Bruce Weir:
If it is Fis you want, then the easiest thing is to recog-
nize that the chis-square goodness-of-ﬁt test for Hardy-
Weinberg is n (m-1) f ^2 where n is the sample size, m
is the number of alleles at the locus and f is the ssam-
ple value of Fis. If f is replaced by the parametic value
then n(m01)f ^2 is the noncentrality parameter for the
noncenral chi-square distribution.
e.g. For a two-allele locus, the noncentrality is nf ^2 and

Nb estimation using linkage answers
Here is my original question:
Dear EvolDir folks,
I have a sample from a single cohort of juvenile frogs
and am wondering if I can apply the linkage disequi-
librium method (as implemented in the NeEstimator46 EvolDir February 1, 2008
program) to this sample to get an estimate of the ef-
fective number of the parents ( *N*b) that produced
the juvenile cohort. Can anyone verify or refute this?
I have microsatellite genotype data for the juveniles as
well as the adults, so I will have an *N*b estimate from
the temporal method as well. I am hoping to use the
LD method to get an additional estimate of *N*b.
Any of your comments on this issue will be greatly ap-
preciated!
Thank you,
Ivan
———–
And here are the answers I received:
Yes, you certainly can get an estimate of parental Nb
from your samples of juvenile frogs (you can also get
another estimate from your sample of adults). You can
get such an estimate from NeEstimator, but you might
want to consider as an alternative a program (LDNe)
we wrote and have described in a paper in press at
Mol. Ecol. Notes. LDNe has a couple of advantages
over other methods based on linkage disequilibrium: *
it implements the bias correction described in Waples
2006 (Con. Genetics 7:167-184.) * It provides sepa-
rate estimates based on diﬀerent user-speciﬁed criteria
for excluding rare alleles. this facilitates evaluation of
potential biases from use of microsat data.
it is easy to use and reads standard input ﬁles (FSTAT,
GenePop). you can access the program, user’s manual,
and related ﬁles at http://ﬁsh.washington.edu/xfer/-
LDNE/ you might also consider using OneSamp (re-
cently described in an online early paper by Tallmon
et al. in Mol. Ecol. Notes). this program uses ap-
proximate Bayesian computation methods to derive an
estimate of eﬀective size based on a single sample.
for your temporal estimate, if you have sampled the
adults non-lethally you have Plan I samples and you
should make sure you use an estimator that accounts
for the correlation in allele frequencies between parents
and oﬀspring. this requires an estimate of N, the total
number of adults your initial sample was (presumably
randomly) sampled from.
best wishes, and let me know if you have any questions.
Robin Waples

First of all I suspect you already have the references on
this method? Here are some - there may be more:

on variation in linkage disequilibrium. Genetics, 95,
477-488.
I’ve used Ne estimator to estimate the number of breed-
ers from a single cohort of amphibian progeny as you
outline. With my dataset (40 tadpoles per population
and 9 microsatellite markers), I deﬁnitely received es-
timates within a plausible range, when applying this
method. Not knowing the actual number of breeders
in the various populations, I had no way of testing
the reliability however. I can only say that in gen-
eral the results appeared in the range we expected, and
that large populations yielded a larger Ne-estimate than
small populations.
Nonetheless, I think you should be very careful to use
any of the Ne methods isolated, and the results should
always be interpreted with caution. To employ sev-
eral methods in combination and use a large number of
polymorphic markers would of course be preferable.
I would be very keen to see the answers you get, so
please post them, if you receive anything useful. Also,
I would appreciate to learn your opinion and experi-
ences with the method once/if you chose to apply it to
your data.

NTSYS analysis choice
Hi,
I am currently working on a population genetics
project, trying to ﬁnd out within and among population
dis/similarities. We ampliﬁed the ISSR region, scored
bands, and generated a band present/absent table for
each individual. We have 8 populations and an average
of 30 individuals per population and we have data from
9 primers for each of these individuals. We have scored
around 1200 plus across individuals and across loci.
Our ﬁrst choice was to use NTSYS to calculate dis-
tances and further generate a dendrogram. I am sure
many out there have experience working with NTSYS.
Here are my questions:
1. First of all is this the correct choice for my kind of
data? If not then what?
2. If using NTSYS, what will be the sequence of oper-
ations that I should perform? Ultimately I need within
and among population comparisons. What is the way
of arranging data in order to obtain among population
comparisons? Or do I have to ﬁrst carry out within pop-
ulation comparisons and then is there some way of av-
eraging out distances obtained from such comparisons
to further use for among population comparisons?
3. Is it relevant to obtain comparisons across popula-
tions for each primer?
Thanks,

Dear All,
We are struggling with FIS and Relatedness results ob-
tained for several populations of tilapia - a cichlid ﬁsh
with complex mating behaviors.
We have found 2 diﬀerent cases: - 3 population FIS
>0 ***= >Relatedness(non-signiﬁcant) - 4 population
FIS>0*** = >Relatedness*** Just by curiosity we
have run Relatedness as well on populations showing
FIS=0 and found X population with FIS=0 = >Relat-
edness***(?).
Positive Fis values are generally regarded as departure
to HWE due to heterozygote deﬁcit. Among the dif-
ferent factors that may explain we ﬁnd: 1. Techni-
cal artefacts (null alleles, allele stutter = >most of the
time, tested using Microcheker or a similar method)
2. Sub-structure (tested with Stucture, PartitionML
or AMOVA approach) 3. Inbreeding - due to poten-
tial mating among relatives (tested using Relatedness
or Identix for instance).
The impact of the two ﬁrst ones have been tested and
ruled out as potential factors causing Fis >0 on our
populations. Identix and relatedness have been run to
check whether the presence of related individuals in our
samples may explain these results.
Question: Would it be posssible that heterozygotes
deﬁcits -revealed by FIS- do not reﬂect exactly the
same thing than the results of Relatedness (excluding
cases of technical artifact & sub-structure) = >for in-
stance diﬀerent degree of kinship (recent and remote
common ancestors)? Or could it be just an eﬀect due
to the calculation method of associated probabilities for
these diﬀerent estimators (Fis & R), eventually aﬀected
diferently by the stochasticity of sampling (e.g. more
sensitivity to detect departure from H0 for Fis than R
estimators)? Does anybody know a paper about this
subject?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot
for your time and expertise.

Social learning evolution
tournament
Tournament: The evolution of social learning strate-
gies: 10,000 euro prize
Dear all.
This email is to provide information about a tourna-
ment that might be of interest to evolution researchers.
The tournament has a cash prize of 10,000 euro:
We have received funding from the European Com-
mission to organize a major international multi-
disciplinary tournament on the evolution of social learn-ing, inspired by Robert Axelrod’s famous Prisoner’s
Dilemma tournaments on the evolution of cooperation.
In recent years there has been a lot of interest (span-
ning several research ﬁelds, but especially economics,
anthropology, and biology) in the problem of how best
to acquire valuable information from others. Mathe-
matical and computational solutions to this problem
are starting to emerge, often using game-theoretical ap-
proaches. We feel the time is right for such a tour-
nament, a sentiment shared by leading researchers in
the ﬁeld who are enthusiastic about this project. We
have set up a committee of world-leading scientists as
experts to help us design the tournament (Rob Boyd,
Marc Feldman, Magnus Enquist, Kimmo Erikkson) and
other leading authorities in this area of science, includ-
ing Axelrod, have been advising us.
In the competition, entrants will submit behavioural
strategies detailing how to respond to the problem of
resource gain in a complex, variable environment in
terms of combinations of individual and social learn-
ing. Where social learning is involved, entrants will be
required to specify eﬀective rules (e.g. conform, imi-
tate the most successful individual, copy in proportion
to each demonstrator’s payoﬀ, copy when dissatisﬁed,
etc). Entered strategies will be evaluated in two stages,
with good performers in pair-wise contests going for-
ward to an all-against-all melee. The author(s) of the
strategy that performs best overall will be presented
with a cash prize of 10,000 euros at the European Hu-
man Behaviour and Evolution Society meeting, in St.
Andrews, U.K. in April 2009.
The competition is now running, and has a closing
date of June 30 2008 and active website: http://-
www.intercult.su.se/cultaptation/tournament.php .
On behalf of ourselves and the committee we would
like to encourage you, the members of your laborato-
ries, and your colleagues and collaborators, to partici-
pate in this competition. Please forward this message
to anyone you think might be interested. We hope that
the social learning strategies tournament will increase
understanding of, and stimulate research on, the evo-
lution of learning, as Axelrod’s tournament did for the
evolution of cooperation.

Software MultiDivTime Helper
Dear Evoldir folks,
We would like to thank all users for the feedback we
have received. Based on these suggestions we have de-
veloped a new version of the script, which incorporates
most of the requests made. The two most important
improvements are:
1.- The alignment ﬁle must be in FASTA format, the
script will now take care of the format conversion au-
tomatically.
2.- The script now creates a ﬁle containing tree(s) with
branch lengths that can be used to estimate the root
to tip distances in TreeStat ( http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/-
software/treestat/ ). There is a tree per partition, and
it should be ready to be loaded into TreeStat for the
root to tip calculations.
This script can be obtained at www.biokubuntu.com
(click in enlaces). If you ﬁnd any problems please let
us know.

Software Phobos
TandemRepeatDetection
Dear Community,
Phobos is a new and highly accurate search tool for tan-
dem repeats (microsatellites, minisatellites, and satel-
lites) in complete genomes.
Some of the most important features are:
- search modes for perfect and imperfect tandem re-
peats.
- perfect repeats can be detected in the pattern size
range from 1 to 5000 bp (and more) in complete
genomesFebruary 1, 2008 EvolDir 51
- imperfect repeats for which two successive units are
identical can be detected in the pattern size range from
1 to 5000 bp (and more) in complete genomes
- imperfect repeats for which no two units must be iden-
tical can be detected in the pattern size range from 1
to 50 bp (and more) in complete genomes.
- Phobos searches for overlapping repeats and for re-
peats hidden within other repeats.
- Phobos searches for alternative alignments.
Example: Let us consider the following simple target
sequence AT(ATATAG)x10 with 10 repetitions of the
main pattern. Using a mismatch penalty of -4, most
microsatellite search tools detect in this sequence only
the imperfect repeat with repeat pattern (AT). In con-
trast, Phobos detects the perfect repeat with pattern
(ATATAG) and (if requested by the user) also the im-
perfect repeat with lower score and pattern (AT).
- Phobos uses an exact, in particular non-probabilistic
search algorithm.
- Phobos is fast. Detecting imperfect microsatellites
(1-6bp) takes, with a mismatch and gap penalty of -6,
about 30 minutes on a modern computer.
- The main feature of Phobos is the high precision with
which it ﬁnds tandem repeats. This makes Phobos an
ideal tool also for a statistical analysis of tandem re-
peats in genomic libraries and complete genomes.
- Phobos comes as a version with GUI and a command-
line version.
Download: http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/-
spezzoo/cm/cm phobos.htm Project status: (cuurent
Phobos version 3.2.6) ————— Phobos is still in
development. It has been released for public use a
while ago since we believe that in its current state it
is already one of the leading tools in its discipline.
Its high accuracy is a major advantage over all other
tandem repeat detection tools that are currently
available.
The following features are currently under development
and should become available this year:
- More ﬁlter options shall be given to the user concern-
ing which and how many alternative alignments should
be reported. (Currently: Report only best alignment
or report all alternative alignments Phobos has found.)
- Detection of compound tandem repeats
- A statistical analysis tool (ﬁnished except for the
GUI).
- I still see the potential of signiﬁcantly reducing the
run time of Phobos especially for long repeat patterns.Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Software RAxML-7 0
Dear Community,
RAxML has recently been updated and is now avail-
able for download as RAxML-7.0.0 at ic www.epﬂ.ch/-
˜stamatak/ (software frame) together with the Manual
(v7.0.0).
Some of the most important new features are:
- A rapid Bootstrapping algorithm, that is on average
15 times faster than the current RAxML Bootstrap-
ping algorithm, while yielding qualitatively compara-
ble results. - A novel, more eﬃcient, ﬁne-grained paral-
lelization that is based on Pthreads instead of OpenMP.
It is also easier to compile and intended for use on
shared-memory machines and multi-core architectures.
- RAxML can now analyze heterogeneous datasets that
comprise concatenated sequences of DNA and AA data.
- Option to perform a per-partition optimization of
branch lengths.
In addition, there are many more less important
new options that are listed at http://icwww.epﬂ.ch/-
˜stamatak/index-Dateien/Page443.htm and on the ﬁrst
page of the Manual.
Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Software TreeFinder-BugFixes
Sorry folks,
the November 2007 TREEFINDER was unstable in
some cases and should no longer be used. There is
now a repaired version available at:
www.treeﬁnder.de The good news is that the insta-
bilities all produced error messages, so if you have
not seen any message, your results are OK. The new
TREEFINDER is now more stable, more accurate,
more eﬃcient, more thoroughly tested than ever before.
TREEFINDER is a software to compute phylogenetic
trees from molecular sequences.
New features are:
- model proposer for DNA, Proteins, RNA - sequence
simulation dialog - improved tree search algorithm -
several bugﬁxes
The model proposer can generate partitioned models.
Please note that I am still not being paid for my work
and that I had no income for years. I wonder if some-
body ﬁnds TREEFINDER worth oﬀering me a com-
pensation, a wage, a position, a perspective.

Software TreeSnatcher
we have developed a JAVA application,
“TreeSnatcher”, that might be of interest for re-
searchers in the ﬁeld of Phylogenetics. Please kindly
refer to our website: http://www.cibiv.at/software/-
treesnatcher/ Abstract: “TreeSnatcher is a GUI-driven
Java application for the semi-automatic recognition of
multifurcating phylogenetic trees in pixel images. The
program accepts an image ﬁle as input and analyzesthe topology and the metrics of a tree depicted with
user assistance. The analysis is carried out in a
multiple-stage process using basic algorithms from the
ﬁeld of image analysis. It yields a Newick expression
that represents the tree structure optionally including
branch lengths. TreeSnatcher can process trees with
more than 100 leaves or more in a few seconds.”
The JAVA source code will be made available upon re-
quest. It is our hope that someone will build a better
user interface, improve the concept or write a similar
program.
We welcome any suggestions

SouthAfrica FieldAssistVolunteers
Volunteer needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Evolution of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
>From April 2008 onwards
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-
tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Whereas the research is
mainly non-invasive, this is no job for extreme animal
right persons (we take tissue and blood samples). Hard
working conditions will await applicants, as the study
species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock),
and stops its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
ﬁeld will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of miceFebruary 1, 2008 EvolDir 53
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
750 (around 80 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
200 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 350 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: Currently we are looking for a vol-
unteer from April 2008. Field assistants are expected
to stay at least 2 months, but longer periods of up to
6months are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your
CV via email to carsten.schradin@zool.uzh.ch.

AvianReproductionTiming
FIELD ASSISTANTS needed for a ﬁeld study in the
Black Hills National Forest of South Dakota starting
roughly at the beginning of April and running through
the end of July 2008 (dates somewhat ﬂexible). The re-
search aims to study the eﬀects of environmental cues
on the endocrinology and reproductive timing of Dark-
eyed juncos. I will require three ﬁeld assistants that will
help with all the aspects of the work, including locating
birds on their territories, ﬁnding nests, targeted and
passive mist-netting, bird measuring and blood sam-
pling, nest monitoring, behavioral observations, and
various other activities related to ﬁeld experiments on
birds. Crew members will be also be responsible for
keeping detailed ﬁeld notes, as well as completing some
lab work and data entry associated with progress in the
ﬁeld. Applicants with a degree or progress toward a de-
gree in the life sciences will have an advantage, as well
as those with ﬁeld experience in ﬁnding nests, mist-
netting, and bird handling. However, motivation is a
primary consideration: the work is hard and demand-
ing, may take place in changing weather and requires
long hours at times. Field assistants will be expected to
work 6 days per week, have the ability to work both in-
dependently and cooperatively, be self-motivated and
demonstrate a willingness to learn new skills, and be
willing to do minor manipulative research with animals.
The work is very rewarding if you are interested in an-
imal behavior and like to be outdoors. Housing will be
provided, and ﬁnancial assistance will be available to
cover some living expenses as well as transportation to
the study site. Write to Christy Bergeon, Department
of Biology, Indiana University, 1001 E. 3rd St., Bloom-
ington, IN, 47405 or email (preferred) cbergeon AT in-
diana.edu. Please include a summary of your back-
ground and your reasons for applying for this position,
as well as the names and email addresses of 3 people
who might evaluate your work or potential. REVIEW
OF APPLICATIONS WILL BEGIN 15 FEB 2008, but
applications will be accepted until positions are ﬁlled.

Tardigrade samples
Hello members of Evoldir.
My name is Søren Faurby I am a danish Ph.D. stu-
dent working on the biogeography of tidal tardigrades,
which usually are found in rather high densities associ-
ated with barnacles and ocationally other substrates.
My traveling funds are unfortunately extremely limited
and I would therefore greatly appreciate if some of you
could send samples of dried barnacles (50-100 individ-
uals).
Samples from the southern hemisphere are especially
interesting but collections from almost evrywhere would
be greatly appreciated. I would be happy to collect ma-
terial for you in Denmark in exchange if you are inter-
ested.

Tetraploid microsatellites software
Dear Evoldir I have a question about tetraploid mi-
crosatellites from plants: How to build a Minimum
Spanning Network of haplotypes? or other kind of
graphic representation that give me an ideia of genetic
relatedness
1)The topic was already discussed in 2004 at least but
I can not now get the complete answers (these were
truncated in the month review of September and July
2004). If you could provide me the complete replies to
Madhav Pandey who posted the question in July 2004
that could help also.
2) Anyway that was in 2004, we are in 2008 is there
now any way to treat tetraploid microsatellites without
knowing the allele dosage. I understood in 2004 Ruz-
ica used Arlequin to make a MSN with diﬀerent ploidylevels including tetraploids so that should be possible
(paper in Moleular Ecology 2004, 13:2101-2103). Do
anyone knows hot to put the data into Arlequin? : as
Haplotypic or Genotypic data? If haplotypic data, how
will be the 2 or 3 allele samples interpreted by Arlequin
(as missing data or what)?
EXAMPLE OF MY DATA: Locus 1
Plant 1 112
Plant 2 112 114 118 120
Plant 3 114 118
Plant 4 118
Plant 5 114 118 120
3) Is there NOW any other beter program to treat
tetraploid microsatellites?
Thank You very much for you help

aims to study the eﬀects of carotenoids and oxidative
stress on sperm quality in a passerine bird, the great tit.
The tits are a good system to examine such questions
as they are hole nesting birds and can then be easyly

help with all the aspects of the work, including check-
ing nests, ringing the birds, catching adults, making
treatments, and more. Applicants with a Msc in Biol-
ogy/Ecology and with bird handling experience would
have an advantage. Supervising for potential Msc anal-
ysis and report would be assured by PhD and post-
doc people from the lab. Motivation will play a key
role: the work is hard and demanding, may take place

PlanktonCommunityEvolution
Eawag is the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science
and Technology, a Swiss-based and internationally op-
erating aquatic research institute within the ETH do-
main.
The Department Aquatic Ecology (group of Bas Ibel-
ings) seeks for a
Postdoc in plankton community evolution
The Postdoc will work on a 3 year project in which long
term continuous data on phytoplankton abundance and
diversity are collected in lake ecosystems (using in situ
scanning ﬂowcytometry) and studied for patterns in
community assembly. The role of ecological assortment
and trait evolution on phylogenetic clustering / overdis-
persion will be studied. The study forms a basis for
better understanding the impact of climate change on
lakes in (pre)Alpine regions.
For this, directly from Eawag ﬁnanced project, we are
looking for a highly motivated candidate. The ideal
candidate has modeling and good statistical skills and
a demonstrable interest in plankton ecology and evolu-
tion.58 EvolDir February 1, 2008
We oﬀer a stimulating research environment in a lively
and social institute in Kastanienbaum (near Luzern),
where several other evolutionary and ecologically ori-
ented aquatic research groups are based. The position
will be for a period of three years, and may start from
May 2008 onwards. A PhD degree in biology or re-
lated subject is necessary for admission. The working
language in the group is English.
The project is a collaborative eﬀort between diﬀerent
departments in Eawag. Amongst others a close collab-
oration with the group of Prof. Reichert (Department
of System Analysis, Integrated Assessment and Mod-
eling) on further development of biogeochemical lake
models is foreseen. Part of the work will be done in the
Netherlands (Group of Prof. Jef Huisman) where the
phytoplankton ﬁeld dataset will be analyzed for chaotic
patterns. Transfer of the knowledge (e.g. on innovative
monitoring techniques) to stakeholders like the Swiss
Cantons is a relevant part of the ﬁnal stages of the
project.
Applications should include a letter of interest with a
description of pertinent experience, curriculum vitae, a
list of publications, the names (with e-mail address) of
two potential reviewers, and copies of the certiﬁcates of

Pattern of nucleotide diversity in candidate genes for
wood chemical properties in eucalyptus and pine
Discipline(s) scientiﬁque(s) : Genetique des popula-
tions, genetique moleculaire, Genomique / Population
genetics, Molecular genetics, Genomics This project is
driven by our desire to understand the genetic basis of
wood formation, a unique feature of trees, and by our
ambition to exploit this knowledge to accelerate and
improve tree breeding for wood and end-use proper-
ties. There is a great need to accelerate breeding inforest trees because of their long generation times and
the projected demand for increased production of good
quality ﬁbres. However, ecological concerns and mar-
ket acceptability require knowledge-based, non-GMO
tree improvement. In this context, our goal will be to
identify genes and nucleotide polymorphisms that gov-
ern naturally occurring phenotypic variation of wood
and end-use properties in breeding populations of Pi-
nus pinaster and Eucalyptus urophylla, two species be-
longing to the main forest tree genera used in industrial
plantations.
Rational/Backgroung : During the past 40 years, op-
timisation of sylvicultural practices combined with the
introduction of improved varieties have contributed to
increase the productivity of our forest in temperate and
tropical regions. Gains in productivity have often been
followed by a reduction in harvest age which has led to a
greater proportion of lower quality juvenile wood being
harvested. In order to maintain the utility of planta-
tion grown wood, there is now a critical need to focus
breeding eﬀorts on the improvement of wood quality.
INRA and CIRAD have developed multidisciplinary re-
searches in order to study whether these traits are vari-
able and heritable and whether simple and early selec-
tion criteria can be deﬁned. In addition, QTL analysis
and the tool kits of genomics have been used in con-
cert in order to identify the genes putatively involved
in wood properties.
Objectives : The main objective of this project is to
study the landscape of nucleotide variation of candi-
date genes for wood chemical composition, as a pre-
requesite toward the application of gene assisted selec-
tion. First, the level and structuration of the diversity
will be described in the genetic pool from which the
breeding populations were derived. Second and keep-
ing in mind the potential adaptive value of wood, we
will test whether the pattern of nucleotide diversity is
compatible or not with the eﬀect of natural selection.
Methodology, Partner, and Schedule: Re-sequencing
and cloning will be used to describe nucleotide diver-
sity in a discovery panel of 20-40 genotypes. In Euca-
lyptus, emphasis will be made on cellulose biosynthesis
related genes. The study will be carried out in Mont-
pellier for one year, within the forest genetics unit of
CIRAD ( http://www.cirad.fr/ur/genetique forestiere ).
In pine, 2000 amplicons are being re-sequenced in USA
(NSF project coordinated by D Neale), and will be used
in association study for several wood properties includ-
ing chemical composition. Genes for which SNPs will
be signiﬁcantly associated with trait variation will be
selected for full length resequencing. The study will be
carried out in Bordeaux for one year, within the BIO-
GECO research unit ( http://www.pierroton.inra.fr/-February 1, 2008 EvolDir 61
biogeco/ ). Nucleotide and haplotype diversity, extent
of linkage disequilibrium, departure from the neutral
model of evolution will be the main outputs of this
study. In perspectives, relevant polymorphisms will be
selected for association mapping in both species.

Montpellier MolEvol
A 18-month post-doc position is available in Montpel-
lier, France, to be started before May 2008.
Project: Molecular evolution of the mitochondrial mu-
tation rate
The evolution of mitochondrial DNA is of particular
interest given its importance as a marker of biodiver-
sity, and its implication in fundamental processes of life.
The mtDNA mutation rate is very high in animals, and
varies by several orders of magnitude across lineages.
These variations have been linked to species metabolic
rate, body mass, and longevity. Taking mammals as
a model taxon, and making use of the extensive ge-
nomic resources available in this group, this project
aims at analysing the evolution of candidate genes po-
tentially controlling the mutation rate of the mitochon-
drial genome.
Salary: 2500 euros per month
Requirements: This is in the ﬁrst place a bioinfor-
matic project, although switching to an experimental
stage at some point is conceivable. Skills in molecular
phylogeny, evolutionary/population genomics, bioinfor-
matics, statistics and programming will be appreciated.
Context: Montpellier is a dynamic city of southern
France hosting a strong community of evolutionary bi-
ologists. The post-doc will be part of the Molecular
Phylogeny group (E. Douzery, N. Galtier, F. Delsuc, S.
Glemin, V. Ranwez, F. Catzeﬂis, among others). We
deal with a variety of questions about molecular phy-logeny, systematics, and genome evolution.

Summary of the project
The study of patterns and processes underlying agingdepends on two crucial questions addressed at two dif-
ferent levels. The ﬁrst one investigates how natural se-
lection shapes the pattern of aging currently observed.
The second one focuses on the proximal physiologi-
cal and molecular mechanisms that determine the ﬁt-
ness reduction with age. Among the proximal factors,
the deleterious eﬀects of internal damages caused by
free radicals have received much attention. This idea
is based on the observation that mitochondrial respi-
ration produces harmful molecules called oxygen free
radicals, or reactive oxygen species. Free radicals are
very unstable molecules that are prone to react with
other molecules, resulting in an oxidative chain reac-
tion. They can cause deleterious eﬀects on cellular
integrity by damaging cellular membranes, peroxidiz-
ing lipids, oxidizing proteins or damaging DNA. Be-
cause free radical-induced damages accumulate during
the lifespan, they have been suggested to be one of the
major proximate causes of the age-associated decline
in ﬁtness. Birds are particularly interesting species for
the study of aging. Indeed, they show particularly low
aging rates and extended lifespan compared to mam-
mals of similar size. This is puzzling, because birds
have higher metabolic rates, internal temperatures, en-
ergy expenditure and circulating plasmatic glucose lev-
els than mammals of similar size. To temper the neg-
ative eﬀects of ROS, aerobic organisms have evolved a
sophisticated antioxidant system relying on an arsenal
of compounds which scavenge and quench free radicals.
Therefore, the particularly high longevity of birds may
be due to a low production of free radicals or to a high
level of antioxidant defences, or both. This proposal
attempts to merge the expertise of two disciplines: evo-
lutionary biology and energetic.

2 POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS: VISUAL
TARGET DETECTION IN HAWAIIAN DAM-
SELFLIES and WING VEIN EVOLUTION IN
FLYING INSECTS
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII. I am seeking two highly
motivated postdocs to work on:
Visual target detection behavior, morphology, and vi-
sual performance in damselﬂies: The Hawaiian dam-
selﬂy genus Megalagrion is an endemic adaptive radia-
tion with extensive color variation and extreme ecolog-
ical diversiﬁcation in terms of breeding habitat (light
environment). Vision is important for foraging (identi-
fying insect prey), identifying sexual partners (females
are often cryptic), as well as avoiding predators. Thus,
learning the fundamental mechanisms by which these
animals with simple visual systems accomplish very dif-
ﬁcult visual tasks may have broad implications for their
ecology and evolution, in addition to possible practicalapplications.
Wing Vein Evolution in Flying Insects: The material
properties of insect wings are widely believe to be con-
ferred by the structure and organization of wing veins.
We will conduct a broad-based comparative study to
quantify wing vein diversity, model how the morpho-
logical features of the veins contribute to the material
properties of the wing, and how this in turn aﬀects the
aerodynamic performance of the wing in ﬂight. Data
collected will include confocal microscopy, SEM, and
estimates of ﬂuid ﬂow via light microscopy. Morpholog-
ical data will be used to inform computational models
using genetic algorithms to “evolve” wing vein patterns
subject to “ﬁtness” imposed by aerodynamics. Models
will be validated by ﬁeld tests of wing damage and ﬂight
performance.
Candidates should have the following: Drive and mo-
tivation to solve diﬃcult scientiﬁc problems. Good
communication/interpersonal skills, good experimental
skills and experience in either animal behavior, visual
or neurophysiology, or kinematic analysis using high-
speed video for postdoc 1 and candidates for postdoc
2 should have good experimental skills and experience
with microscopy, kinematic analysis using high-speed
video, or morphometrics with experience with image
analysis. Demonstrated ability to do ﬁeld and lab work.
Self-starter and creative problem-solver. Both post-
docs must have some familiarity with scientiﬁc com-
puter programming and excellent quantitative skills.
Desirable qualiﬁcations: Candidates experienced in the
R programming language and with solid data analysis
skills are preferred. Candidates interested in extending
the project to address major questions in behavior, sen-
sory physiology, or evolutionary ecology are particularly
welcome. Fabrication skills. Experience with insects a
plus.
Candidates interested in extending the project to ad-
dress major questions in behavior, sensory physiology,
or evolutionary ecology are particularly welcome.
The Butler lab is in the Department of Zoology at the
University of Hawaii, studies the evolution of morphol-
ogy from functional, structural, and adaptive (evolu-
tionary) perspectives. Other projects in the lab include:
the evolution of sexual dimorphism in lizards and dam-
selﬂies, locomotor biomechanics and the physical eﬀects
of pregnancy in lizards, opsin evolution in damselﬂies,
and direct modeling approaches to phylogenetic com-
parative methods.

HumanEvolGenomics
University of Pennsylvania: Postdoctoral Positions in
Human Evolutionary Genomics
Postdoctoral positions are available in a human popu-
lation genetics laboratory aﬃliated with the Depart-
ments of Genetics and Biology at the University of
Pennsylvania. Projects in the lab focus on a unique
resource of DNA samples and phenotype data from eth-
nically and geographically diverse African populations.
These samples are being used for genome-level anal-
yses of diversity at both coding and non-coding loci
(including high throughput resequencing, CNV analy-
ses, and whole genome SNP genotyping). For many
of these samples we also have phenotype data for a
number of traits that are likely important in adapta-
tion and disease. We are using these data (1) to infer
population structure and demographic history and to
test models of modern human evolution (2) to iden-
tify regions of the genome that are targets of selec-
tion (3) to identify functionally signiﬁcant variants us-
ing genotype/phenotype association studies as well as
gene expression analyses (4) to study genetic and phe-
notypic variation at loci that inﬂuence drug metabolism
and (5) to study the genetic basis of resistance against
infectious disease (with a focus on malaria) and co-
evolution of the human and Plasmodium falciparum
genomes. Collaborators on these projects include
Philip Awadalla, Carlos Bustamante, Junhyong Kim,
Gil McVean, Joshua Plotkin, Jonathan Pritchard, Anna
Tramontano, and Greg Wray. Independent and cre-
ative postdoctoral research projects will be encour-
aged. Additional information about the Tishkoﬀ
lab can be found at http://www.med.upenn.edu/-

Uppsala ComputationalGenetics
We are seeking researchers interested in joining our
Computational Genetics program in Uppsala, Sweden.
We are interested in understanding the genetics under-
lying complex traits using a computational approach.
Projects are often, but do not necessarily have to be,
inspired by problems or opportunities that advent from
experimental data. We encourage scientists to form
and develop their projects to suit their interests and
abilities within the framework of existing funding. We
also support grant proposals from individuals that wish
to pursue individual projects. The project portfolio
in the group will thus vary, but we usually have on-
going projects in the ﬁeld of statistical and compu-
tational methods in genetics, genetic modeling, ex-
ploratory analyses of experimental datasets and exper-
iments to validate interesting biological ﬁndings.
A common theme in our research is epistasis. We are ac-
tively developing models, algorithms and tools for large
scale screening and interpretation of the genetic eﬀects
of epistatic QTL in regulating complex trait expression.
Our tools have mostly been used to study the impor-
tance of epistasis in phenotypic evolution using data
from divergent crosses between domesticated animals.
If you have an interest in or ideas for projects in this
ﬁeld or an interest in working with i) explorations of the
role of of epistasis in ecological and population genet-
ics, ii) how data from large-scale genome resequencing
can be utilized in genetic mapping or iii) development
of new methods for genetic mapping of complex traits,
we look forward to hear from you!We aim to integrate researchers with diﬀerent back-
grounds both within and across traditional scientiﬁc
disciplines. We do, however, foresee that you have a
relevant scientiﬁc education (Ph.D. degree or similar)
and an interest in Quantitative-, Population- and Evo-
lutionary Genetics. A strong mathematical / statistical
background and programming experience is an advan-
tage
If you want to learn more about us, please visit http:/-
/www.computationalgenetics.se or contact ¨Orjan Carl-
borg (orjan.carlborg@hgen.slu.se). If you are interested
in working with us, please send us a CV, list of pub-
lications and a short description of what interests you
in the ﬁeld of complex trait genetics and what you can
contribute to in an interdisciplinary group working on
this topic. We look forward to hear from you!
Salary and conditions of future employment(s) are un-
der the terms of the current agreement for academic sci-
entists employed in the public sector. We are looking
for several candidates and positions will remain open
until suitable candidates have been found. Positions
can start 1 Feb, 2008 at the earliest.

Introduction. Phylogenetic methods have revolution-
ized modern systematics and become indispensable
tools in evolution, ecology and comparative biology,
playing an increasingly important role in analyses of
biological data at levels of organization ranging from
molecules to ecological communities. The construction
of phylogenetic trees is becoming a methodology that is
well-deﬁned, with broad agreement on the central issues
and questions. A nearly standard set of topics is now
taught as part of the curriculum at many colleges and
universities. On the other hand, application of phylo-
genetic methods to interesting problems outside of sys-
tematics is an area of special excitement, innovation,
and controversy, and perspectives vary widely.
In March, 2008, for the ninth year, we will teach a work-
shop for graduate students interested in applying phy-
logenetic methods to diverse topics in biology. The one-
week course will be an intensive exploration of problems
to which modern phylogenetic tools are being applied.
We cover a range of topics in biogeography, ecology,
conservation biology, phylogenomics, functional mor-phology, macroevolution, speciation, and character evo-
lution. The course starts with recent advances in phylo-
genetic methodology, and then focuses on methods and
tools that can be brought to bear on these “applied”
issues in the context of a given phylogeny.
The course will be held entirely at the Bodega Marine
Lab on the Northern California coast, which has ex-
tensive computing resources and on-site housing. The
course format will involve equal parts of lecture, discus-
sion, and training in software and internet tools. One
afternoon during the week will be left free for ﬁeld trips
to local natural areas.
Speciﬁc Topics to be Covered
* Finding, evaluating and interpreting phylogenetic
trees; phylogenetic databases * Recent advances in
tree reconstruction: Bayesian inference; stochastic opti-
mization strategies; divide-and-conquer methods; Garli
& other approaches * Analysis of character evolution–
theory: parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian approaches;
null models and statistical testing * Analysis of char-
acter evolution–form and function of complex charac-
ter systems * Phylogeography; coalescent methods for
inferring migration rates and patterns * Phylogenetic
comparative methods * Phylogenetic perspectives on
biodiversity and conservation biology * Data mining of
sequence databases for phylogenetic analysis * Estima-
tion of divergence times from sequence data * Species
delimitation and phylogenetic taxonomy
Instructors for the main workshop.
* H. Bradley Shaﬀer * Peter Wainwright * Kevin de
Queiroz * Tom Near * Rich Glor * Phil Spinks * Justen
Whittall * Brian O’Meara * Alan Lemmon * Emily Mo-
riarty Lemmon * Robert Thomson * Bruce Rannala
plus guest lecturers!!
Prerequisites. Students should have some familiarity76 EvolDir February 1, 2008
with phylogenetic methods through previous course-
work. Some experience with PAUP, PHYLIP, or other
programs for phylogeny reconstruction will be assumed.
Admission and Fees. Students will be admitted based
on academic qualiﬁcations and appropriateness of re-
search interests. The course fee is $450. This includes
room and board at BML for duration of the course (ar-
riving March 8, leaving March 15) and transportation
from Davis to BML.
Application Deadline. Applications are due by Jan-
uary 15, 2008. Please send a completed applica-
tion form (available at http://www.eve.ucdavis.edu/-
bodega/bodega08app.doc ) and one letter of recommen-
dation from your major advisor. Applications should
be sent via email as PDFs to pqspinks@ucdavis.edu.

INRA. RIVAGE gratefully acknowledges the ﬁnancial
support of the Conseil Regional Ile de France and INRA
for this event.
In a completely innovative form, this event will bring
together top scientists and young researchers to addressFebruary 1, 2008 EvolDir 77
cutting-edge scientiﬁc topics, and use it as case-studies
for transdisciplinary analysis, practice project building,
and work out their careers plan.
Context and issues Facing the challenges of the post-
genomic era implies a change of scale for which re-
searchers have to be prepared. In response to these ma-
jor scientiﬁc and economical issues, initiatives in system
biology and epigenomics are teeming. The programme
of this research school aims to facilitate the identiﬁ-
cation of coherent strategies for research prospects as
well as training (initial and life-long) and careers. This
change of scale implies the defragmentation of research
activities, disciplinary barriers, applied and fundamen-
tal frontiers. Consequently, the programme is built
around three main sequences: a science update, project
building and trans-disciplinary processes. We mix in a
very innovative way scientiﬁc conferences on key topics,
technical lectures on project building, interdisciplinar-
ity and careers, and workshops where attendees will
practice project building in transdisciplinary interac-
tions. This training should guide each participant to
deﬁne his(her) role in creating the best research envi-
ronment (institutional and business) to tackle the com-
plexity of the post-genomic challenges.
Public Senior, experienced and young researchers
(PhDs) from the public or private sectors working in
animal genetics & physiology or mathematics, partic-
ularly those who use generic data, and who wish to
clarify their position, and career prospects through a
coherent strategy regarding the development of animal
post-genomics. In particular, we hope to have the joint
participation of supervisors with trainees.
Participation to the school (registration, accomodation)
is free, only the travel is at the expense of the partic-
ipant (though support for travel might also be consid-
ered depending on particular situations, please contact

ber of participants is limited to 60. Candidates must ﬁll
in a questionnaire, and might be selected by the advi-
sory and organising committees according to the ﬁeld of
experience, interest and motivation to participate to the

The main objective of the School is to provide train-
ing in rapidly developing disciplines that are becoming
increasingly important in health sciences. It includes
genetic epidemiology and human evolutionary genet-
ics, population genomics and bioinformatics, integrat-
ing tools of formal analysis with data retrieval and ex-
tensive use of internet resources. The training will be
based on real-data examples from the research of the
instructors’ laboratories. In one module we will also
present genealogical resources speciﬁc to Quebec and
introduce informatics methods for their use in popula-
tion analysis and epidemiology. The School consists of
four days of workshops: genetic epidemiology including
biostatistics (2 days), population genomics (1.5 days),
and Quebec population resources (0.5 days).
The School, organized by Dr Damian Labuda from

GRAND CHALLENGES IN COMPUTATIONAL BI-
OLOGY New developments for solving the unsolved
problems of Computational Biology
University of Bologna, Giorgio Prodi Hall, Piazza San
Giovanni in Monte Bologna (Italy)
Feb 11-15, 2008
In our century grand challenges are at hand in Science.
Great expectations have been generated in diﬀerent
ﬁelds by the increasing role and impact of computing
and computer science in processing terabytes of data.
In our era the ’computational thinking’ of computer
science meets the empirical and theoretical methods
of Natural Sciences, from Physics to Biology with an
un-precedent eﬀort of accelerating breakthroughs and
beneﬁts to society. Ongoing projects aim at under-
standing the universe and the origin of life for better
helping to preserve and protect our planet. Simulation
and modeling go global and the novelty is that this is
so also in Biology, where Bioinformatics and Computa-February 1, 2008 EvolDir 79
tional Biology help in understanding basic mechanisms
from molecular biology to systems/organismic biology
in order to revolutionizing medicine and healthcare.
Data acquired at molecular level from diﬀerent species
and/or individuals need to be analyzed at large and in-
tegrated in order to investigate our common origins and
how we diﬀerentiated from each others, also in relation
to environmental factors. Worldwide-integrated plat-
forms for scientiﬁc computing, implementing also new
mathematical and statistical approaches, and based on
new computing paradigms need to be implemented for
real time processing of the enormous amount of ex-
perimental data, produced at hyperbolic rate by ge-
nomics and proteomics eﬀorts. New ideas and/or re-
organization of scientiﬁc eﬀorts with a better collabo-
ration among researchers in theoretical, computational,
experimental areas of investigation are urgently needed.
In the 9th edition of the Bologna Winter School in
Bioinformatics, we will then ask the question of what
grand challenges Computational Biology and Bioinfor-
matics will explore in the next decade. Diﬀerent sub-
jects focusing as a test case on the human genome,
including genome annotation, biodiversity, alternative
splicing and its regulation, epigenetics, information
transfer from 1D to 3D genetic code, cellular function
and simulation, genomic medicine, SNPs and maladies
will be reviewed to highlight present results and future
perspectives to cope with the requirement of integrating
computation with molecular description to understand
basic principles of Biology.

Michael P. Cummings, Director
The Workshop on Molecular Evolution has been the
ﬁnest course in the subject since it was started in
1988. The Workshop consists of a series of lectures,
demonstrations and computer laboratories that cover
various aspects of molecular evolution. A distinguish-
ing feature of the Workshop is a well-equipped com-
puter laboratory with Apple Macintosh computers and
servers for comparative analysis of molecular data. Au-
thors and experts in the use of computer programs
and packages such as BEAST, Clustal W and Clustal
X, FASTA, GARLI, LAMARC, MAFFT, MrBayes,
PAML, PAUP*, and PHYLIP provide demonstrations
and consultations. This two-week program is designed
for established investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and
advanced graduate students with prior experience in
molecular evolution and comparative genomics. Sci-
entists with a strong interest in molecular evolution,
systematics, and population genetics are encouraged to
apply. Enrollment is limited to 60 students, and 15
students will be admitted to an extended topics session
for the purpose of analyzing their research data sets.
Many participants ﬁnd the extended topics session to
be especially useful.82 EvolDir February 1, 2008
Topics to be covered include:
* Databases and sequence matching: database search-
ing: protein sequence versus protein structure; homol-
ogy; mathematical, statistical, and theoretical aspects
of sequence database searches * Phylogenetic analysis:
theoretical, mathematical and statistical bases; sam-
pling properties of sequence data; Bayesian analysis;
hypothesis testing * Maximum likelihood theory and
practice in phylogenetics and population genetics: coa-
lescent theory; maximum likelihood estimation of pop-
ulation genetic parameters * Molecular evolution inte-
grated at organism and higher levels: population bi-
ology; biogeography; ecology; systematics and conser-
vation * Molecular evolution and development: gene
duplication and divergence; gene family organization;
coordinated expression in evolution * Comparative ge-nomics: genome content; genome structure; genome
evolution * Molecular evolution integrated at lower lev-
els: biochemistry; cell biology; physiology; relationship
of genotype to phenotype
2008 Fees: $2400 (room and board at no additional
charge), plus an additional $850 for the extended top-
ics session.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
AfterwardFebruary 1, 2008 EvolDir 83
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
