The Gordon Conference on Ecological and Evolution-
ary Genomics is fast approaching! There is still time
to register! We have a few slots remaining if you would
like to attend.
The 2011 conference will present cutting-edge research
on using genomics approaches to study adaptation of
organisms to changing environments, genome evolution
and population genetics, as well as the evolution of
complex phenotypes. A diversity of sessions will high-
light recent results from natural as well as experimen-
tal populations, and will cover both non-model and
model species. There will be an exciting balance be-
tween ecologists using genomics to study adaptation in
rapidly evolving systems, as well as genomicists using
large-scale sequence, expression and functional assays
to study variation among populations and species.
We have a great slate of speakers.ˆ aˆ aFor more

Dear colleagues,
We would like to draw your attention to the mini-
symposium “Genomic approaches to coral reef biol-
ogy” at the 2012 International Coral Reef Symposium,
which will take place in Cairns in July 2012 ( http://-
www.icrs2012.com ). The abstract is below.
We very much look forward to your contribution and to
eventually seeing you in Cairns! If you have any ques-
tions with respect to this mini-symposium, please do
not hesitate to contact any of us!
With best regards,

MINI-SYPOSIUM ABSTRACT:
Coral reefs are disturbed on a global scale by means of
human-induced environmental changes including global
warming and progressive rise of sea surface tempera-
tures as well as increases in carbon dioxide that lead to
ocean acidiﬁcation. Although the last decade has seen
a lot of progress in our understanding of the responses
and adaptation of the coral and its symbionts to these
environmental changes, still little is known about the
molecular mechanisms that underlie these responses.
Mostly, because to date there have been only few eﬀorts
to apply systems biology and genomic approaches to the
holistic understanding of the biology of coral reefs.
An important goal for the mini-symposium is to pro-
vide crash course introductions to some of the latest
achievements in coral genomics and systems biology ap-
proaches to coral reef biology. Another purpose is toJuly 1, 2011 EvolDir 5
promote research in this direction and to promote in-
teraction between coral reef researchers from diﬀerent
areas. The speakers will present both the wide scope
of the topic and important new results. The mini-
symposium will be an excellent opportunity to shed
light on this new systems biology and genomics era for
coral reef biology.

for submission of abstracts and early registration is
*July 1st, 2011*.
The third EMBO conference on host genetic control
of infectious diseases will be held on September 28-30,
2011 at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. Advances in hy-
giene and medical care in parallel with the develop-
ment of antibiotics and mass vaccination in the second
half of the 20th century created the belief that human-
ity will soon overcome the death-causing burden of in-
fectious diseases both in developed and in developing
countries. This was however an illusion. The outburst
of the HIV pandemics, the spread of antibiotics resis-
tant strains of many common infectious bacteria, the
high rate of acquired infections in hospitals, the burst
or re-appearance of viral epidemics, such as Inﬂuenza or
SARS, the appearance of drug resistant parasitic infec-
tions etc, demonstrate that infectious diseases remain
and even are ampliﬁed as a major health problem for
humanity.
The subjects will be include:
*- Primary immune-deﬁciencies - **Host control of
viruses and prions infections - **Host control of bac-
terial infections - Fungi and parasites - Model systems

Symposium ˆ aInsect Flightˆ a, 29-30th August 2011 in
Lund, Sweden
Deadline approaching! Please register by July 15th
Animal ﬂight has evolved only four times in history, in
pterosaurs, birds, bats and insects. To date, insects
constitute a majority of the worldˆ as life forms, and
ﬂight appears to have contributed to this inordinate
evolutionary success story.
Because ﬂight links a series of fundamental processes
within both the physical and biological sciences we
aim to provide a plenum for scientists from various
ﬁelds (evolutionary ecology, morphology, physiology,
behaviour, biomechanics) to present insight into the
diﬀerent aspects and implications of insect ﬂight and
to combine aspects from biology and engineering to an
integrated view on insect ﬂight.
Information about CAnMove and the preliminary pro-
gramme can be found at our homepage: http://-
canmove.lu.se/node/715 Registration: Attendance of
the symposium is free, if you want to attend, please
register by ﬁlling in our online-registration form. The
deadline for applications is July 15th
We especially encourage Ph.D. students to present and
discuss their work here. Should you have any questions
regarding the symposium please do not hesitate to con-
tact Sophia Engel (sophia.engel@biol.lu.se).

BirdsOfAFeather
In anticipation of the 2011 conference on Informatics
for Phylogenetics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvo-
Bio), we solicit all attendees to propose and discuss
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings. See below for details.
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings (BoFs) are informal, ad-
hoc, focused face-to-face discussion groups that form
around a shared interest. BoFs can also take the form
of a hands-on software tutorial on using a tool, or on
programming an API. BoFs have a leader (usually, but
not necessarily, the proposer) who initiates or mod-
erates the discussion. The topics of BoFs can range
widely, including general cultural or computational in-
frastructure issues, or narrower questions such as how
to make the best use of a particular software tool or
how to solve a particular computational challenge.
Anyone willing to lead such a group can propose a BoF.
iEvoBio will provide space that can accommodate up
to 8-10 BoFs. Sign-up sheets will be provided on-site
on the ﬁrst day of the conference where attendees can
propose a BoF or sign up for one proposed by someone
else. BoFs will be about 1-1.5 hours in duration and
take place in the afternoon of the second day of the
conference.
In line with their informal nature, there is no oﬃcial
prior call for or submission of BoFs. However, we en-
courage those intending to propose one to sound out
or rally potential attendees ahead of time. We suggest
to employ Twitter ( http://twitter.com ) for this, using
the #ievobioBof tag to mark BoF proposals and com-
ments. Similarly, users interested in seeing a hands-on
tutorial BoF about their favorite tool are encouraged
to use similar means to give tool developers a sense of
the community interest in a tutorial BoF, and what
common usage (or programming) questions are.
Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings are only 1 of 5 kinds of
contributed content that iEvoBio will feature. The
other 4 are: 1) Full talks (closed), 2) Lightning talks,
3) Challenge entries, and 4) Software Bazaar entries.
All Calls except for Full Talks remain open (see http:/-/ievobio.org/ocs/index.php/ievobio/2011/ ) .
More details about the program and guidelines for con-
tributing content are available at http://ievobio.org .
You can also ﬁnd continuous updates on the confer-
ence’s Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/iEvoBio .
iEvoBio is sponsored by the US National Evolutionary
Synthesis Center (NESCent) in partnership with the

ety of Systematic Biologists (SSB). Additional support
has been provided by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL).

DeadlineExtended
The deadline for submitting entries to the Challenge
held by conference on Informatics for Phylogenetics,
Evolution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio) has been ex-
tended by one week to June 20, 2011.
The iEvoBio Challenge is a competition to create a new
software tool, or add a new feature or features to an
existing platform. Entries to the Challenge need to
respond to its theme, which for 2011 is “Data Integra-
tion”.
Further information on the nature of challenge entries
and how to submit them can be found on the iEvo-
Bio website at http://ievobio.org/challenge.html . Se-
lected candidates will make short oral presentations to
demonstrate their work in a “Challenge session” at the
conference, and if suitable will automatically be entered
into the Software Bazaar track of the conference. The
winning entries will be selected by a vote of the iEvoBio
meeting participants, and will be awarded cash prizes.
Challenge entries are only 1 of 5 kinds of contributed
content that iEvoBio will feature. The other 4 are:
1) Full talks (closed), 2) Lightning talks, 3) Software
Bazaar entries, and 4) Birds-of-a-Feather gatherings.

want strong students who are interested in sexual se-lection, the evolution of acoustic mate attraction sig-
naling, the evolution of mate choice, quantitative ge-
netics of sexually selected traits, or quantifying mating
preference functions within and across species. My lab-
oratory works with ﬁeld crickets as model organisms.
Details of some of the ongoing research in my lab can
be found at www.carleton.ca/ ˜ sbertram . Please con-
tact me directly prior to applying to Carleton’s PhD

“Biodiversity in Tropical Areas and its conservation” is
a one-year MSc program (75 ECTS) oﬀered jointly by
the International University Menendez Pelayo (UIMP,
Ministry of Education, Spain) and the Spanish National
Research Council (CSIC, Ministry of Science, Spain).
The program is fully funded by the CSIC, with a strong14 EvolDir July 1, 2011
emphasis on fellowships for Latinamerican students; the
title is an oﬃcial European MSc degree conceded by the
UIMP. The program will be taught in Ecuador, with an
emphasis on practical studies in natural reserves. The
program is international, with a minimum of 15 and a
maximum of 30 students.
ROUTE TO PhD DEGREE.- Qualiﬁed graduates from
the MBATC program have the possibility to continue
their PhD studies in CSIC Departments (Real Jardin
Botanico, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, etc.)
through separate application calls opened each year.
They can also apply to other programs in the Spanish
science system, or to any European or American uni-
versity, as this MSc title is an oﬃcial European degree.
WHAT DO I NEED TO APPLY TO THE
PROGRAM?.- You are eligible to apply to the program
if you hold a Bachelor’s degree in any suitable ﬁeld, es-
pecially on biosciences: biology, forestry, or agriculture,
but also in geography or economics for example.
You must be proﬁcient in Spanish language.
FINANCIAL SUPPORT.- The CSIC oﬀers 5 scholar-
ships covering registration fees (1300 euros/student).
Independently, the program funds at least 13 additional
full scholarships for Latin American applicants.
HOW TO APPLY?.- The application period for studies
starting in October 2011 is now open until 9-July-2011.

EMBL Cambridge
MolecularPhylogeneticsPHD FELLOWSHIP IN MOLECULAR PHYLOGE-
NETICS
Description: A PhD fellowship is available in Nick
Goldman’s research group ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/-
goldman ) at the EMBL-European Bioinformatics
Institute. The fellowship is within the Euro-
pean Molecular Biology Laboratory’s International
PhD Programme ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/-
Studentships/phd.html; http://www.embl.org/-
training/phdprogramme/index.html ) and the success-
ful applicant will be registered at the University of
Cambridge.
PhD projects can be in any area of the Group’s in-
terests, which concentrate on methods of data analy-
sis that use evolutionary information in sequence data
and phylogenies to infer the history of living organisms,
to describe and understand processes of evolution, and
to use this information to make predictions about the
function of genomic sequence. We are particularly in-
terested in exploiting next-generation sequencing data
and have also worked on applied evolutionary studies
and algorithms in sequence analysis and conservation
biology. We also hope to initiate a project on large-scale
phylogenies (the “Million Protein, Thousand Species
Tree of Life”).
PhD candidates will typically have degree-level back-
grounds in one or more of mathematics, statistics, com-
puter science, molecular biology or similar areas. Lack
of experience in some of these areas is not considered
a problem, so long as candidates demonstrate aptitude
and enthusiasm to learn.
Further details on application procedures etc. are avail-
able at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/Studentships/-
phd/howtoapply.html . Please note that candidates
must register with the online application system by 30
June 2011 and must complete their applications by 11
July 2011. The PhD fellowship may start in October
2011, or as soon afterwards as the successful candidate

tive research institute that is committed to the eco-
logical, economical and social management of water.
The Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) in Munich
is among the top one hundred universities in the world,
and part of the German Excellence Initiative. These
institutions share common goals towards education, re-
search and technology transfer at the highest interna-

Two PhD students in Evolutionary Biology
Project title: Hostˆ aparasite interactions in hybridizingJuly 1, 2011 EvolDir 17
Daphnia, the role of variable environments
Both PhD students will participate in a collaborative
research project with Dr. Justyna Wolinska (LMU) and
PD Dr. Piet Spaak (Eawag) to study the role of vari-
able environments on hostˆ aparasite interactions in hy-
brid systems and on hybridization success per se, us-
ing Daphnia (waterﬂeas), which are a well-established
model in both host-parasite and hybridization research.
Speciﬁcally, we will study changes in parasite preva-
lence as well as changes in host and parasite popula-
tion structure, by using collections of zooplankton sam-
ples dating back to the beginning of the last century.
Then we will relate the observed patterns to experi-
enced changes in environmental conditions (like water
temperature or trophy level). Finally, by using the
ˆ aresurrection ecologyˆ a approach (i.e. hatching Daphnia
clones of known age from diapausing eggs preserved in
lake sediments) we will test for adaptations of old and
recent clones to certain environmental conditions.
Both students will use molecular techniques and con-
duct laboratory experiments. However, the position at
LMU focuses on host-parasite interactions. The main
methods will be qPCR, cloning, sequencing, microscopy
and modeling. The position at Eawag focuses on in-
terspeciﬁc hybridization. Here the main methods are:
microsatellites, sequencing, experiments and ﬁeld work.
Although the students will be primarily hosted at their
given institution, the German student will spend a cou-
ple of weeks working in Switzerland and vice versa.
Moreover, the external collaborators on this project are
hosted in Konstanz (DE) and in Sheﬃeld (UK), and
students will have the opportunity to visit these exter-
nal labs as well. The students will take part in the
organized PhD programs (including attending various
skills courses) of their respective organization.
For this project, ﬁnanced by the Swiss and German
Science Foundations (SNF & DFG), we are looking for
highly motivated candidates with interests in the evo-
lutionary ecology of host parasite interactions.
We oﬀer a stimulating research environment in lively
and social institutes in D¨ ubendorf (near Z¨ urich) and
in Munich. At both localities, the departments host
other research groups in ecology and evolution. The
position will be for a period of three years, and should
start as soon as possible (September 2011 or soon there-
after). The Eawag PhD student will be enrolled at the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z¨ urich
the German PhD student at LMU. The ideal candi-
date should have good molecular skills and/or a strong
background in evolutionary biology or population ge-
netics. Excellent communicational and writing skills in
English, good work ethics, and creative thinking aredesired. A Diploma or Masters degree (or equivalent)
in biology or related subject is necessary for admission.
The working language in the groups is English.
Applications should include 1) a letter of interest with
a description of pertinent experience (it should be spec-
iﬁed which position, LMU or Eawag, would be the ﬁrst
choice, 2) curriculum vitae, 3) abstract of the mas-
ter/diploma thesis, 4) a list of publications (if any),
5) the names (with e-mail addresses) of three potential

We invite applications for the above full-time study
opportunity at the FitzPatrick Institute, a world-
renowned, national Centre of Excellence (CoE) in or-
nithological research with a strong emphasis on post-
graduate studies.
The MSc student will integrate an international group
of researchers investigating cooperation in sociable
weavers /Philetairus socius/ near Kimberley, South
Africa.20 EvolDir July 1, 2011
Sociable weaver individuals cooperate to build a mas-
sive communal nest structure and to raise young. How
is this cooperation achieved and how do individuals de-
cide whether to cooperate or to defect? One explana-
tion for cooperation is kin selection, but this unlikely
explains the maintenance of ’public goods’ that concern
a whole group rather than just kin.
This study will investigate the role of dominance and
sexual selection in cooperation and conﬂict resolution in
the sociable weaver. We will examine two behaviours:
cooperative nest building and cooperative breeding.
The study will involve extensive behavioural observa-
tions to establish dominance hierarchies and whether
there is social segregation or competition for access to
speciﬁc communal tasks (such as helping at the nest or
nest-building activities). In addition, we will investi-
gate the role of melanin-based plumage signals in both
males and females.
The successful applicant will have a BSc Honours or
equivalent, relevant ornithological ﬁeld experience and
a demonstrated ability to work independently.The stu-
dent should have a strong interest in pursuing theoreti-

UExeter ModellingEvolution
Fully funded PhD position: Modelling evolutionary and
ecological processes in the marine microbial ecosystem
http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/-
?id=3D821 A PhD position is available with Dr
Hywel Williams in Biosciences, College of Life and
Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter
(Streatham Campus, Exeter) to commence October
2011. The studentship will cover UK/EU tuition fees
for three years, plus an annual stipend of £13,590pa
for three years.
Microbes (prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes)
play a central role in the marine carbon cycle, which
is of key importance for global climate change. New
data from genomics are linking microbial genes to en-
vironmental functions, showing that microbial ecology
and evolution are tightly linked to ecosystem processes.
This understanding should enable better prediction of
how marine ecosystems will respond to global change.
However, new approaches to modelling marine ecosys-
tems are needed to take advantage of these insights.
We have pioneered an agent-based approach that mod-
els the marine microbial food web as a complex adaptive
system in which evolutionary, ecological and environ-
mental processes can be studied simultaneously. This
method is currently being used to understand selection
pressures on microbial growth in diﬀerent environmen-
tal conditions, the evolutionary formation of nutrient
recycling loops, and how coevolutionary dynamics of
bacteria and bacteriophage aﬀect ecosystem dynamics.
The student will join our modelling team to further de-
velop this approach. The choice of research topic will bedeveloped in discussion between the supervisor and the
student, within the broad overall theme of the marine
microbial ecosystem. The student will join an active
and rapidly growing research group at the University of
Exeter. The project will require a strong background
in mathematics, computer science, physics, or another
numerical discipline. Additional background in molec-
ular biology, microbiology, ecology, evolution, or envi-
ronmental science would be an advantage, but is not
essential.
We welcome informal enquiries from prospective appli-
cants (contact Dr Hywel Williams, University of Exeter:
h.t.p.williams@exeter.ac.uk).
The closing date for applications is Thursday 30 June
2011 and we expect to hold interviews towards the end
of July.

UGuelph MarineInvertBiodiversity
Graduate Position in Marine Barcoding - University of
Guelph & Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada
We are seeking an enthusiastic Ph.D. student with an
interest in applied evolutionary genetics and taxonomy
to conduct a DNA barcoding study on marine inver-
tebrates as part of a large multi-disciplinary network
conducting studies on aquatic invasive species (Cana-
dian Aquatic Invasive Species Network, CAISN). This
barcoding project is a collaborative one, involving re-
searchers at the University of Guelph, Fisheries and
Oceans Canada, and University of Windsor. Excel-
lent MSc candidates with undergraduate research ex-
perience will also be considered.
Many global invaders are marine invertebrates such as
crustaceans, molluscs, and ascidians that often present
taxonomic challenges, especially in early life history
stages. DNA barcoding has been identiﬁed as a robust,
widely applicable method that could serve as an inter-
national standard for the identiﬁcation of aquatic inva-
sive species on a global scale as it has practical advan-
tages over classical taxonomic methods. However, its
utility for this purpose needs to be validated-especially
when invaders and co-occurring native species are very
similar-and its usefulness is a function of the availability
of validated DNA barcoding datasets.
The successful candidate will apply DNA barcoding22 EvolDir July 1, 2011
methods to generate essential baseline data on inverte-
brate biodiversity in Canada’s coastal waters and will
then evaluate the utility of this approach for invasive
species identiﬁcation and detection. This project may
also involve generating molecular phylogenies based
on multiple nuclear markers where needed to resolve
taxonomic uncertainties of important marine invaders.
Species identiﬁcations will be obtained in collaboration
with taxonomic experts, and the relationship between
cryptic species diversity and body size will be explored
using the resulting datasets.
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate who
is interested in playing a substantial role in develop-
ing novel research directions for this project, using the
sequence data to address exciting questions in ecology
and/or evolution. Potential research topics include in-
vestigating the phylogenetic distribution of “invasive-
ness”; analyzing molecular evolutionary rates across
diﬀerent taxa; or comparing patterns of genetic diver-
sity, species diversity, species complementarity, and in-
vasive species prevalence among regions.
The student will be co-advised by Dr. Sarah Adamow-
icz (University of Guelph) and Dr. Cathryn Abbott
(Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and will
also collaborate with other DFO and university re-
searchers. The successful candidate will be based at the
Paciﬁc Biological Station in Nanaimo, B.C. for a por-
tion of the studentship. This position provides the op-
portunity to conduct novel research in invasion biology,
ecology, and evolution and will serve as an outstanding
training ground for those interested in governmental,
academic, or private-sector careers in biology and envi-
ronmental science.
Stipend funding is available at NSERC network rates.
Canadian citizens and permanent residents are pre-
ferred as there are no project funds for international
student fees. The project start date is to be be-
tween May 2011 and January 2012. To be consid-

2 PhD positions: Evolution, Symbiosis and Population
Genomics: Lausanne, Switzerland
We are seeking 2 highly motivated students with an in-
terest in molecular biology, genomics and/or evolution-
ary ecology to join our group working on symbiotic my-
corrhizal fungi. These important fungi form mutualis-
tic symbioses with most plants, improving plant growth
and inﬂuencing diversity of ecosystems. The fungi have
a highly unusual genome organization, harbouring ge-
netically diﬀerent nuclei that are passed from one gen-
eration to the next (Hijri & Sanders, Nature 2005) and
this has important consequences on plant growth (See
Angelard et al. 2010 in Current Biology). The main
goals of our research are to understand how the genet-
ics and multiple genomes act on these fungi and how24 EvolDir July 1, 2011
this can be used to create more beneﬁcial strains of the
fungi for use in sustainable agriculture and the environ-
ment.
A selection of possible projects include:
- Stability/heritability of fungal traits associated with
improved growth of rice and cassava - Evolutionary ge-
nomics and population genomics / transcriptomics of
the mycorrhizal symbiosis - Population genetics of my-
corrhizal fungi in natural or agricultural systems - Link-
ing quantitative changes in genetically diﬀerent nuclei
with important plant phenotypic traits
The candidate should be familiar with ecology and evo-
lution or molecular biology or genomics/bioinformatics
and have an interest in applying this knowledge to evo-
lutionary & ecological questions. He/she should also be
willing to interact with the other group members work-
ing on evolution and population biology of mycorrhizal
fungi (see list of recent publications on our web site).
The successful candidate must have a Masters degree
(MSc) or equivalent in order to qualify for our PhD
program. We are located in the Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolution (DEE) at the University of Lau-
sanne (Switzerland). The Department is situated on
the shores of Lake Geneva and provides a pleasant &
exciting research environment and a strong PhD pro-
gram. It is also one of the largest institutions in Eu-
rope for research in ecology and evolutionary biology,
comprising 17 diﬀerent research groups. A genomics
research centre also exists at the same site.
Ability to speak and write English is essential.

PhD fellowship in evolutionary genomics
A PhD fellowship is available with Dr Benedicte Lafay
(www.ampere-lyon.fr/spip.php?article351 ) to study the
evolution of multipartite genome in procaryotes em-
ploying the tools of bioinformatics. The primary ob-
jective of the project is to investigate the setting up of
coordinated processes implicated in the transmission of
genetic information (multiple chromosome replication,
partition and segregation), using comparative genomics
and complete genome sequences available from public
databases. A further objective is to build a generalized
molecular model of these processes to help in the nu-
merical modeling of these phenomena. This project of-
fers the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team
including evolutionary biologists, molecular microbiol-
ogists, mathematicians and complex systems engineers.
Applications are sought from suitably qualiﬁed candi-
dates to undertake doctoral research at the University
of Lyon, France (lyon-university.org). The ideal candi-
date will have a strong background in genetics, molecu-
lar biology, bio-mathematics, bioinformatics or similar
areas, as well as a keen interest in evolutionary biology
and molecular evolution. Lack of experience in some of
these areas is not considered a problem, so long as can-
didates demonstrate aptitude and enthusiasm to learn.
Knowledge of microbiology may help but is not neces-
sary.
No nationality restriction applies to this fellowship.
Please note that applications must be received by 25
June 2011.

Subject: Canalisation, which allows the maintenance
of a phenotype despite genetic or environmental vari-
ability, inﬂuences the emergence of evolutionary inno-
vations. On the physiological level, homeostasis may
be seen as a form of canalisation that depends on ex-
ternally induced signals that circulate inside the in-
ternal milieu and regulate target genes. In animals,
nuclear receptors are major actors of this regulation,
being both ligand receptors and transcription factors.
The function of a nuclear receptor is determined by al-
losteric changes of the structure, which can be induced
by DNA binding, ligand binding, phosphorylation or
interactions with other proteins. The aim of this PhD
project is to understand the constraints that determine
plasticity and robustness of nuclear receptors during the
evolution of animals. The three main questions are: 1)
Molecular dynamic and evolutionary dynamic: Is there
a link between the structural constraints and the evo-
lutionary constraints that act on nuclear receptor? 2)
Geometry of ligand-binding pocket: Is it possible to
deﬁne a speciﬁc morphology for the pocket of the four
diﬀerent types of nuclear receptors: hormone receptors,
nutritional sensors, receptors with a constitutive activ-
ity and true orphans? 3) Evolution of DNA-binding:
What is the origin and evolution of DNA-binding do-
mains and response elements of nuclear receptors?

UNebraska PlantInsectInteractions
I am seeking a student interested in studying the adap-
tations that enable herbivorous insects to cope withthe defenses mounted by their host plants. In the lab
we mostly focus on leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) as a
study system but research need not be limited to this
group. There will be opportunities to work with high
throughput sequencing, proteomics and RNA interfer-
ence to characterize the genes and gene products that
contribute to the insect’s counter-defenses. A long term
aim of this research is to understand the degree to which
herbivorous insects are able to optimize their counter-
defense strategies, particularly when comparing species
with generalist versus specialist feeding habits.
Support is available in the form of a graduate assis-
tantship that provides a stipend, tuition and partial
funding of health insurance. The assistantship is open
to individuals wishing to pursue a PhD. or Masters de-
gree. Priority will be given to candidates with prior
research experience.

USussex SocialBees
NERC/School of Life Sciences-funded PhD studentship
at Sussex University
Environmental and genetic components of a major evo-
lutionary transition
We seek a student interested in understanding the
transition to sociality, one of the central problems
in evolutionary biology. Functional (adaptive) ques-
tions about sociality have been well-studied, but much
less is known about underlying mechanisms. Sweat
bees (Halictinae) are unusually valuable for elucidat-
ing social transitions. Unlike other hymenopteran lin-
eages, which comprise entirely social taxa (e.g. hon-
eybees, paper wasps), there are closely related non-
social as well as social sweat bees, and a well-resolved
phylogeny suggests that there have been many tran-
sitions in both directions between sociality and non-
sociality(1). Of special interest are socially polymor-
phic taxa such as Halictus rubicundus, where females26 EvolDir July 1, 2011
in warmer environments form small social groups while
those in cooler environments are non-social. Such
taxa provide ideal material to investigate the under-
lying basis of sociality. In a recent study, we di-
rectly induced transitions between sociality and non-
sociality by transplanting H. rubicundus reciprocally
between UK populations that normally express alterna-
tive phenotypes(2) (see also http://www.sussex.ac.uk/-
newsandevents/index?id=3D5828, which includes a
short video of H. rubicundus). In addition to these com-
mon garden experiments in the ﬁeld(2), we are develop-
ing a method for rearing sweat bees in a controlled en-
vironment. The studentship would use these and other
techniques to investigate how general social plasticity is
in sweat bees, and to test potential environmental cues
that determine social phenotype. Note that these are
small ( <1cm) bees that do not sting humans and live
in colonies of <10 individuals. See our website ( http:/-
/www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/ﬁeldlab/ ) for more details of
the research group. Possible foci for the research in-
clude:
(1) Social plasticity in UK sweat bees. Our previ-
ous ﬁndings(2) suggest that instead of representing re-
peated evolutionary gains and losses of the traits un-
derpinning sociality, transitions between sociality and
non-sociality might represent plasticity. The ability
to express either sociality or non-sociality in response
to environmental conditions might then be cryptic but
widespread. This could be tested by carrying out com-
mon garden experiments with other UK sweat bees.
(2) Test for plasticity in North American populations
of H. rubicundus. H. rubicundus has a holarctic distri-
bution. There is signiﬁcant mitochondrial diﬀerentia-
tion between US populations expressing the two social
phenotypes(3), whereas there is no such diﬀerentiation
among British and Irish populations(4). This suggests
that in the US, social phenotype might be genetically
ﬁxed rather than ﬂexible. These and other diﬀerences
between US and UK bees could also be examined.
(3) Environmental cues that sweat bees use to deter-
mine which social phenotype to express are currently
unknown. The eﬀect of cues such as daylength, tem-
perature and mating status(5) could be investigated.
The balance between these aims will depend on initial
results and the developing interests of the student. My
group is collaborating with that of Prof Rob Paxton, a
molecular ecologist at University of Halle in Germany.
Prof Paxton’s group is currently annotating the tran-
scriptome of H. rubicundus. Although it would not be
the main focus, it is possible that towards the end of
the study, the PhD student could be involved in RNA
expression work using H. rubicundus samples collectedduring the studentship.

UZurich MaternalEﬀects
PhD Position in Evolutionary Ecology University of
Zurich, Switzerland
A fully-funded 3-year PhD position is available in Bar-
bara Tschirren’s group at the University of Zurich,
Switzerland, to work on the genetic and epigenetic basis
of maternal investment in birds.
The environment a mother provides for her oﬀspring
before birth can have signiﬁcant and long-lasting conse-
quences for her oﬀspring’s morphology, physiology and
behaviour later in life. Prenatal maternal eﬀects are
therefore considered to be an important mediator of
phenotypic plasticity and a major source of variation
in evolutionary ﬁtness. Yet, we still know very little
about why mothers diﬀer in the quality and quantity
of resources they provide to their young and how dif-
ferent maternal investment strategies evolve.
In this project, we will establish breeding lines with
Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) and use molecular
techniques to tackle the genetic basis of maternal in-
vestment. Furthermore, by manipulating environmen-
tal conditions experienced by mothers before reproduc-
tion, we will measure long-term consequences of envi-
ronmental maternal eﬀects on the reproductive invest-
ment of the subsequent generations (i.e. daughters and
grand-daughters). The studies on captive quails will be
complemented by work on wild-living passerines that
takes place in our group. The project is funded by the
Swiss National Science Foundation.The ideal candidate for this project is fascinated by
evolutionary questions, highly motivated, independent
and creative. She / he has a background in evolution-
ary biology, behavioural ecology, (epi-)genetics or ani-
mal breeding (or a related ﬁeld). Previous experience
with molecular techniques, experimental design, and /
or statistics is a plus. A MSc (or equivalent) in Biology
is required. The starting date is January 1 2012.
The successful applicant will be based at the Institute
of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of
the University of Zurich, providing ample opportuni-
ties for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary ﬁelds ( http://-
www.ieu.uzh.ch/index.html ). The research groups are
very international and the working language is English.
Zurich is a beautiful city that consistently ranks
amongst the cities with the highest quality of life.
While it oﬀers all the pleasures of living in a bigger
city, thanks to it’s central location and excellent public
transport connections, it is very easy to get out of the
city and head for the mountains for outdoor activities
such as hiking, climbing or skiing.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlin-
ing your motivation to work on this project as well as
relevant experience, 2) a detailed curriculum vitae, 3)
copies of academic qualiﬁcations, 4) the contact details
of two academic referees, and 5) a 1-page description of
your MSc project. Send the above as a single .pdf ﬁle
to barbara.tschirren@ieu.uzh.ch
Review of applications will start on August 1 2011, but
candidates will be considered until the position is ﬁlled.

Position description: Work full time (40 hours/week)
as a teaching assistant and laboratory prep assistant
in the introductory biology program for the 2011-2012
academic year. The position has two main components,
teaching and behind-the-scenes laboratory preparation.
Teaching component: The primary teaching responsi-
bility of the position is to lead laboratory sections of up
to 16 students in the Duke University Biology Depart-
ment’s new genetics and evolution Gateway course, Bi-
ology102L. Each Biology 102L section meets weekly for
2.5 hours for a combined hands-on laboratory/problem-
based learning session. Additional teaching responsibil-
ities include (a) attending and taking notes at all course
lectures including the weekly large discussion section,
(b) grading weekly student written assignments and oc-
casional oral presentations, (c) helping with the prepa-
ration and grading of mid-semester hourly and ﬁnal ex-
ams, and (d) assisting students during oﬃce hours and
otherwise mentoring students as beginning biologists.
Teaching assistants should plan to come to Durham
early the week of August 22, 2011, and are expected
to participate in a teacher-training workshop before the
fall semester begins. TAs also attend weekly prep ses-
sions during the semester on Mondays.
Prep component: The second set of duties associated
with the position is to assist in the prep. work for the
teaching labs in Biology 101L, 102L, and the labora-
tory diversity course, Biology 106L, as determined by
the Lab Administrator. Responsibilities include setting32 EvolDir July 1, 2011
up and putting away equipment and specimens for lab-
oratory exercises, maintaining supplies in lab rooms be-
tween sections, cleaning glassware, assisting with ﬁeld
collection of live specimens, and helping to care for a
diverse collection of invertebrate animals in salt-water
aquaria. The lab prep workload is likely to require oc-
casional evening (until 10 PM) and/or early morning
(8 AM) work.
Salary: The projected salary for the position is $18,000
for 8.5 months. Employment begins on August 22, 2011

Potential research projects are: (i) develop-
ment/analysis of phylogenetic alignment methods
eﬃciently using current computer hardware and
strategies for their use on large datasets; (ii) develop-
ment/analysis of phylogenetic alignment methods to
account for uncertainties in the homology inference;
(iii) development of methods for comparative analyses
of next-generation sequencing data; (iv) evolutionary
analyses of non-model organisms using next-generation
sequencing data. A candidate’s own project matching
group’s other interests can also be considered.

keep the research on ecological interactions and ecolog-
ical genetics at world class by increasing the focus of
animal physiology and cell biology of animals towards
environmental and ecotoxicological questions. Notably
teaching and research on disturbances of animal func-
tion (ecotoxicological teaching and research) requires
detailed understanding of normal functions of animals
(ecophysiology). Thus, combination of the two in the
applicants knowhow is sought . It helps in understand-
ing environmental adaptation and combining genetic
and ecological approaches to environmental biology.

Zambia FieldAssist CichlidBreeding
Field assistant to study behaviour of cooperative breed-
ing African cichlids, Lake Tanganyika (Zambia)
The project investigates the inﬂuences of helping be-
havior on ﬁtness prospects and life-history in the highly
social, cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus
pulcher (diving depth: 8-12m). It is part of a long
term project which has been launched in 2009 attempt-
ing to follow permanently marked individuals over sev-
eral years. The ﬁeld assistant will carry out behavioral
observations under water using Psion PDAs and Ob-
server software of marked ﬁsh in their natural group.
We search a ﬁeld assistant for a diving expedition of the
University of Bern in autumn 2009. The ﬁeld work will
last 3 months and takes place near Mpulungu, Zam-
bia, starting end of August. Candidates must hold a
SCUBA diving certiﬁcate (PADI Open Water Diver or
equivalent), should have diving experience and need to
have experience in behavioral observations. Experience
with ﬁsh is considered an asset and a high degree of
motivation is needed as ﬁeld assistants will be working
independently. The ﬁeld team will have 7 members and
support from local authorities.
Accommodation at the ﬁeld site is remote and very ba-
sic, but beautifully located on the shore of Lake Tan-
ganyika. Fieldwork and diving is physically demanding.
All expenses for travel, accommodation and medical
precaution are covered, but no salary can be paid.
Candidates send a statement of scientiﬁc interests

AFLP troubleshooting
Dear EvolDir members,
Recently we started to experience a drop in the number
of high molecular weight bands in the AFLP proﬁles of
our study systems (diverse alpine plants). The selec-
tive seems to work, just 20-30% of the bands are lost.
This happens to fragments over 200-300 bp, and to all
samples within our lab, but despite changing reagent
stocks, the problem persisted. We have tried also dif-
ferent dillutions of res-lig and preselective reactions, but
without success.
Any comments would be highly appreciated!

EvolutionRateEstimation
Hello,
I am trying to estimate evolutionary transition rates for
a multistate, non-ordinal trait that is polymorphic for
several taxa (i.e., several taxa have more than one trait
state).
I have a two questions about estimating these transition
rates.
First, when I use either ML or MCMC in BayesTraits,
for any given transition, I am encountering a wide range
of rate variation across analyzes even when using the
same data and the same tree. For instance, when I run
a ML analysis 100 times on the same tree, for a single
transition, I’ll get a range of rate values from 0-33. In-
terestingly, I do not see a similar degree of variation in
the ancestral state reconstruction.
I imagine the multistate, polymorphic nature of the44 EvolDir July 1, 2011
trait plays a role in the variation I am observing, but
it is still surprising. Is there any way I can reduce the
uncertainty around these rate estimates?
Second, I am would also like to tally up the number
of transitions estimated from a parsimony analysis. I
can estimate ancestral states using parsimony easily
enough in Mesquite. However, there are too MPRs to
use the ’summarize state changes’ function in Mesquite
to count transitions. So I was wondering if there is a
function or package in R (or elsewhere) to count state
transitions across a phylogeny, given that I already have
the estimated node values.
Any advice on either of these issues would be much
appreciated!

Biogeography teaching exercises
Dear Evoldir,
I am designing a new course in biogeography, aimed at
upper-division undergraduates. As part of the course
I would like to include some simple exercises in GIS,
phylogeny reconstruction, and/or phylogeography. If
anybody has already developed exercises in these area
and would be willing to share them with me, I would
greatly appreciate it.
I am happy to post a summary of any replies I receive.

Detecting population subdivision
Dear colleagues,
I am trying to detect population subdivision of metage-
nomic sequences. Below I described the type of data I
have. I am seeking for a program / method which can
measure population subdivision for my data.
This dataset is from marine metagenomics study. Basi-
cally, seawater was sampled and bacteria were ﬁltered.
Then DNA was directly sequenced from the bacterial
community without culturing the bacteria. So it is diﬃ-
cult to trace the source organisms for the metagenomic
sequences. Due to the nature of high biological diver-
sity in the ocean ecosystem and sequencing depth cover-
age, the compiled sequence alignment datasets, each of
which contains closely related homologous genes from
a dominant bacterial population, are essentially from
diﬀerent but closely related organisms/lineages. For
example, if there are 6 sequences in one alignment, and
8 sequences in another alignment, those 14 sequences in
total are most likely from 14 individual closely related
organisms/lineages.
I would greatly appreciate if you could provide some
clues. Thanks!

Hi Evoldir,
I’m interested to know of diﬀerent strategies people
use to manage their routine molecular systematics
data, namely, accessions, DNA extractions, PCRs at-
tempted/successful, sequences, etc. I’ve always used
Microsoft Access, which is ﬁne for me. But it has a
steep learning curve, making it hard to teach to stu-
dents in the lab, and it’s not available on a Mac. I
know a lot of people keep everything in a Big Excel
Spreadsheet, but that is not as versatile if one is ac-
customed to being able to run queries, etc. on a large
dataset.
Perhaps there is another solution that combines ease-of-
use & versatility that I’m not aware of? I will be happy
to post a summary of the community’s suggestions.
Cheers, Norm Douglas

Lab management strategies answers
Many thanks to those who replied to my query about
managing lab workﬂows.
It seems that most respondents are currently using the
Big Excel Spreadsheet method, with some groups hav-
ing the spreadsheet stored “in the cloud” i.e. as a
Google Doc for safety and accessibility.
Many respondents suggested using FileMaker Pro,
which is a relational database (like Microsoft Access)
that is a native Mac OS application. I had looked at
this, and also at OpenOﬃce.org’s Base program, which
is cross-platform and open-source. Other relational
databases suggested were Bento (not familiar with it,
but it is made by the same company as FileMaker Pro,
and seems like it might be a “lite” version) and Visual
Fox Pro.48 EvolDir July 1, 2011
Finally, a couple of dedicated solutions were suggested
(and I’m not reviewing these- just ﬁrst impressions):
Lablife seems to be a web-based service with a free aca-
demic license. It seems like a very general assistant lab
manager, supporting inventory, ordering, etc. with a
few biology-speciﬁc features and cloning tools.
EarthCape ( http://www.earthcape.com <
http://www.earthcape.com/ >) seems like will be
primarily a collection/accesssion management tool
and not speciﬁcally oriented toward dealing with
genetic data and workﬂows, though it may have some
functionality for this.
Finally, the Moorea Biocode LIMS /(Laboratory
Information Management)/ Software ( http://-
software.mooreabiocode.org ) is an add-on to the
Geneious program which tracks samples and sequenc-
ing experiments within Geneious.
None of our students have had any experience with re-
lational databases, and while some of these programs
may be easier to learn & use than MS Access, it is a
lot to ask of students when they are also trying to learn
PCR & sequencing, etc. The Biocode LIMS looks very
slick, and may be exactly what we need since our lab
uses Geneious anyway.
Thanks again to all who responded! Norm

PCR problems
Hello, a colleague gave me the link to your website and
maybe you could help me.
For my Bachelor Thesis I work with blood samples
(with EDTA) of Asian Elephants (kept in zoos) to anal-
yse microsatellite locis. But the PCR shows no results.
I tried Gradient PCR to ﬁnd out the right Annealing-
Temperature, but just with low success. I isolated the
DNA from the samples a second time also with low
results at the PCR. I also changed the conc. of the
template DNA (from 0,5 to 3 µl) with no success. The
analysis of mtDNA showed good results.
Ingrdients for one sample: 12,175 µl H20 3,75 µl Buﬀer
(Mg 7,5 mM) 0,75 µl dNTPs (2 mM each) 0,5 µl Primer
(10 mM) 0,075 µl Taq (5u/ µl) 1µl template DNA
I use the following Primers: La02; La03; La05; FH60;
FH94; FH102; EMX02; EMX03; LafMS02; LafMS03;
LafMS05.
I hope somebody who worked with EDTA blood sam-
ples and may had to do with similar problems could
give me help or a hint to get some results from the
samples.
with best regards,

PCR products remain in wells
Dear all,
I have a PCR phenomenon that I can ﬁnd no answer
to, and would like to know if anyone has an expla-
nation. Over the course of many years (maybe too
many!) of PCR reactions, typically amplifying prod-
ucts of between 700 - 2kb, occasionally, but only very
infrequently, I have experienced samples that present
what appears to be the product of the PCR reaction
that has failed to migrate from the well, instead ﬂuo-
rescing brightly within the well. The low frequency oc-
currence of these events have meant that I have thoughtthem to be curious, but largely ignored them. Looking
around on various discussion threads it seems this is
a phenomenon others have experienced, and there are
diﬀering opinions about what the cause is, summarized
here:
1) An excessive amount of the target amplicon has been
produced, and somehow this has limited its ability to
migrate through the gel.
2) Too much template in the reaction.
3) The reaction failed, and what is observed in the well
is the genomic template.
4) An issue related to reaction eﬃciency - e.g. primers
are problematic.
We have a reaction where “the blob” in the well is a
real issue, and we can rule out all of the above, leav-
ing me with the question of what is actually going on?
We are amplifying a 10kb mtDNA fragment in beetles.
Some beetles amplify well for the fragment, while oth-
ers give no band, but a blob in the well, and others may
present both a faint band, and a blob in the well. So
whatever is happening, the blob would seem to be the
result of a reaction that is outcompeting the target am-
plicon for the primers and nucleotides in the reaction
mix. The genomic DNA for all samples is ﬁne, we’ve
run it out to check the integrity. The primers are ﬁne,
as they work for the same set of samples (i.e. those that
give the expected 10kb product, and those that yield
the blob) in conjunction with other primers to amplify
smaller amplicons. We’ve tried diﬀerent template con-
centrations, and that has not solved the problem. Ad-
ditionally, we can rule out that the blob is in any way
related to the target amplicon, as we’ve tried sequenc-
ing the blob with a series of internal primers of known
functionality, and these yield no sequences (not a trace
- i.e. ﬂat chromatagrams). Curiously, successful PCR
or blobbing seems to be sample speciﬁc - i.e. samples
seem to consistently amplify, or consistently blob.
All things PCR have an explanation, but this is one
that I am completely at a loss to explain. Can anyone
out there provide an explanation? I’m oﬀering a pint
of beer to the ﬁrst person who can*.
I hope I’ve been clear, if anyone would like further de-
tails, just ask.

Phyloseminar JStajich Jun29
Next up at phyloseminar.org:
Jason Stajich speaks Wednesday, June 29th at noon
PST on “Fungal phylogenomics: Getting lost in the
moldy forest.”
Abstract: Fungi occupy diverse ecological niches in
roles from nutrient cycling in rainforest ﬂoors to ag-
gressive plant and animal pathogens. Molecular phylo-
genetics has helped resolve many of branches on the
Fungal tree of life and enabling studies of evolution
across this diverse kingdom. The genome sequences
from hundreds of fungi now permit the study of change
in genes and gene content in this phylogenetic context
and to connect molecular evolution with adaptation to
ecological niches or changes in lifestyles. I will describe
our work in studies contrasting pathogenic and non-
pathogenic fungi and eﬀorts to unravel the evolution
of multicellularity in fungi comparing unicellular basal
fungi with multicellular mushrooms and molds.
The development of tools for data mining and use of
fungal genomics is also driving the pace of molecular
biology and genetics of fungi. I will highlight new ap-
proaches to make this easier and the ways data inte-
gration can inform and transform studies of functional
biology of fungi.

Software ChromatoGate
The program is called ChromatoGate. It performs 4
basic operations:
1. Calculation of consensus sequences (when both for-
ward and reverse primers have worked well) 2. Gener-
ation of preliminary ﬁles (I will explain this in a while)
3. Detection of Ambiguous Characters in a multiple
alignment calculated from the preliminary ﬁle 4. De-
tection of all polymorphic sites in a multiple alignment
calculated from the preliminary ﬁle
The aim of the program is to allow for easy detection
of sequencing errors in a multiple alignment.
The generation of preliminary ﬁles is basically a gath-
ering of all the sequences generated by a sequencer into
a FASTA ﬁle. Possible edge trimming according to the
user’s request is performed and also the reversed com-
plement of the sequences that have been assembled with
a reverse primer is calculated. This step is essential in
order for the tool to remember what changes have been
applied on each sequence after is was produced by the
sequencer.
During the 1 and 2 operations the program stores all
the information needed so that, in the 3rd and 4th op-
erations to be able to give the exact chromatogram po-
sitions of the nucleotides responsible for polymorphisms
or ambiguous characters.
The goal is to provide an alignment to chromatogram
mapping in order for the user to easily check the chro-
matograms in order to verify whether a polymorphic
site in an alignment is actually polymorphic or it is
because of a sequencing error.
This is the underlying idea of the program and a paper
presenting ChromatoGate and the complete framework
is going to be submitted soon.

Software IMgc revised
Hi,
IMgc reads recombination-rich multiple sequence align-
ments, and returns the largest block containing no four-
gamete violations. This software was originally written
to generate input datasets for the IM family of pro-
grams, a demographic inference package developed by
Jody Hey. However, IMgc is useful for other purposes
as well X such a creating input ﬁles for Bob Griﬃths’
demographic inference software, Genetree.
A software notice for IMgc was published in Bioinfor-
matics in 2007:
Woerner, A. E., M. P. Cox, and M. F. Hammer. 2007.
Recombination-ﬁltered genomic datasets by informa-
tion maximization. Bioinformatics 23:1851-1853.
IMgc is written in Perl, and the original version re-
quired a working installation of BioPerl. Over the
years, this dependency has been a limiting factor for
many users.
The authors announce that the BioPerl dependency of
IMgc has now been removed. The new version of IMgc
can be run anywhere with a basic, functioning installa-
tion of Perl. In other words, it will run as-is on OS X
and most UNIX platforms, as well as under ActivePerl
for Windows.The revised code is available here:

sion of IMgc is hosted here:

Software MacClade free
MacClade free MacClade is now free to download at
http://macclade.org/download.html .MacClade’s PDF
manual is included in the download. As we have shifted
our programming eﬀorts to Mesquite, we will only be
providing limited support for MacClade.
MacClade will not work under MacOS X Lion Mac-
Clade is a program built for the older PowerPC com-
pilers, and has been able to run on the newest Mac com-
puters because of Apple’s Rosetta, which allows Pow-
erPC applications to run on Intel processors. However,
Rosetta will no longer be included in the new version
of MacOS X, 10.7 (Lion), to be released soon. For this
reason, we expect that MacClade will no longer func-
tion. This will be true of all other PowerPC programs,
too. Thus, if you wish to still use MacClade, you should
keep a Mac running MacOS X 10.6 or before.
Open Source? We are considering opening up the
source of MacClade; if you are interested in this, for
example to convert it to run on the newer operating
systems, please contact us. It is written primarily in
Pascal.

Software MetaPIGA
Dear all,
We are glad to announce a major release (version 2.1) of
MetaPIGA now implementing PROTEIN models and
multiple new features (see below). The software and its
new manual are freely available at www.metapiga.org .
If you own a previous version of MetaPIGA2, it will be
automatically updated through the internet next time
you launch the program, and the new manual will be
available in the MetaPIGA -help’ menu.
MetaPIGA 2.1 (BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11: 379) is a
robust implementation of the Metapopulation Genetic
Algorithm (metaGA; PNAS, 99: 10516-10521 (2002))
and additional stochastic heuristics for large phylogeny
inference under Maximum Likelihood. It implements
complex substitution models (for protein and DNA
data), discrete Gamma rate heterogeneity, the possi-
bility to partition data, and model testing (LRT, AIC,
AICc, BIC) for the selection of the model that best ﬁts
your data.
The major additional new features in version 2.1 are:
Faster processing, reduced memory requirements; Pro-
tein models (GTR20, Poisson and empirical mod-
els such as WAG, JTT, DAYHOFF, VT, BLO-
SUM62, CPREV, MTREV, RTREV and MTMAM);
AIC (+AICc) and BIC model testing for protein data
(model testing was already available for DNA data);
Standard binary dataset support (GTR2: 2 states
model : 0,1); Ancestral-state reconstruction using con-
ditional likelihood values; New meta-heuristic (random-
restart hill climbing); Dataset quality control for iden-
tical sequences, and for excessively divergent and/or
ambiguous sequences; The possibility for automated
alignment trimming using the trimAl algorithm ( http:/-
/trimal.cgenomics.org’ Capella-Gutierrez et al., Bioin-
formatics 2009 25: 1972-1973): removal of excessively
gapped and/or divergent columns; Many new function-
alities (multiple ﬁles -drag and drop’, possibility to
use FASTA ﬁles, choice of the models to compare in
AIC and BIC model testing, suﬃcient and necessary
stop conditions, extended and improved functions in
the TreeViewer, ...); SourceForge support (general sup-
port, forum, bug reports, feature requests trackers, and
a mailing list). Bug corrections are: Resolved “freez-
ing” issues that could happen with multi-processors
analyses; Improved consensus-tree generation; Resolvedmemory leak problems during model testing; Many oth-
ers. Please check the -Change Log’ (in the help menu)
for a full list of changes.
Importantly, MetaPIGA-2.1 will make you happy if
you like using a graphical user interface (GUI) BUT
it should also make you happy if you hate using a GUI.
Indeed, MetaPIGA provides BOTH: An extensive GUI
for parameters setting, following run progress, and ma-
nipulating result trees, and High customization through
manual batch ﬁles and command line processing. Fur-
thermore, if you need to use batch ﬁles (for example,
to run them on a distant server) but hate to type the
commands yourself, MetaPIGA2 allows you to generate
batch ﬁles through the GUI.
MetaPIGA2 uses standard formats for data sets and
trees, is platform independent (Mac, Windows, and
Linux), runs in 32 and 64-bits systems, and takes ad-
vantage of multiprocessor and multicore computers.
MetaPIGA2 is described in: Helaers & Milinkovitch;
BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11: 379.
The metaGA algorithm is described in: Lemmon &
Milinkovitch; PNAS, 99: 10516-10521 (2002).
We hope you’ll enjoy MetaPIGA-2.1 !

Software optiFLPJuly 1, 2011 EvolDir 53
We are happy to announce optiFLP, a new member of
our family of AFLP analysis software.
When using automated AFLP scoring software, having
good scoring parameters is the key to achieving good
binary proﬁles from a raw set of data. Using our earlier
published tinyFLP software, it became obvious that it
is not enough to test a few diﬀerent parameter sets in
the hope that the best one will be among them. There
are thousands of possible sets, and an automated solu-
tion is needed to check all of them and identify promis-
ing parameterisations. This is the major intention of
optiFLP: the user may deﬁne intervals and stepwidths
for all scoring parameters, and the software will search
this parameter space and perform Analysis of Ranked
Similarities (ANOSIM) in order to ﬁnd settings which
maximise the contrast between groups of proﬁles.
optiFLP supports a supervised mode when it is feasible
and desirable to use information on sample grouping,
such as place of collection or population assignment,
but also a novel unsupervised mode where no a priori
information about the genetic structure of a sample has
to be provided.
optiFLP will return the best parameter settings identi-
ﬁed, a tree, results of pairwise tests between all groups
of samples to identify each group’s contribution to the
detected signal, and outﬁles that can be readily used
as input for as broad range of population and phyloge-
netic software like MrBayes, Structure and GenAlEx.
The program can be used via an interactive menu or in
command line mode.
optiFLP v1.31 is available at http://sourceforge.net/-
projects/optiﬂp/ The original paper describing the
software is Arthofer W., Schlick-Steiner B.C. and
Steiner F.M. (2011) optiFLP: software for automated
optimization of ampliﬁed fragment length polymor-
phism scoring parameters. Molecular Ecology Re-

Software SuiteMSA
Hi, everybody.
We are announcing our new software: SuiteMSA, a
java-based application that provides unique multiple
alignment (MSA) viewers. With SuiteMSA, users can
directly compare multiple MSAs and evaluate where
the MSAs agree (are consistent) or disagree (are incon-
sistent). SuiteMSA also provides a GUI for a sequence
evolution simulator (indel-seq-gen version 2, iSGv2) as
well as a graphical phylogeny editor/viewer.
Six main tools of SuiteMSA are: ˆ a MSA Viewer: a sin-
gle MSA viewer with secondary structure and trans-
membrane prediction displays. ˆ a MSA Comparator:
pairwise MSA comparison viewer. It also calculates
statistics (e.g., sum of pair scores and column scores).
ˆ a Pixel Plot: multiple MSA comparison using pixel
plots showing gap patterns ˆ a iSG Simulation: sequence
simulation by iSGv2 ˆ a Phylogeny Viewer: a graphic
phylogeny viewer/editor ˆ a MSA reconstruction: Mus-
cle and ClustalW2 GUI (more methods will be added
soon).
SuiteMSA is available from: http://-
bioinfolab.unl.edu/ ˜ canderson/SuiteMSA/ BMC
Bioinformatics paper on SuiteMSA has been also
just published: http://www.biomedcentral.com/-
1471-2105/12/184 If anybody is at Evolution 2011
meeting at Norman, Oklahoma, we will be doing the
demonstration of SuiteMSA during iEvoBio on June
21st: Lightning Talk (short introduction) at 2:45 pm
and Software Bazaar (demo) at 3:30 pm. Please stop
by. We would like to answer any questions and discuss
future development personally.54 EvolDir July 1, 2011

SpeciationResearch TravelGrants
Dear colleagues,
The European Research Networking Programme “Fron-
tiers of Speciation Research”, supported by 18 National
Funding Organizations in member countries of the Eu-
ropean Science Foundation, is inviting applications for
travel grants intended to foster collaborations between
European researchers working on topics related to the
Programme.
Support is available for short visits (up to 2 weeks)
and exchange grants (up to 3 months), with preference
given to junior researchers at a graduate or postdoc-
toral level. Applicants will want to keep in mind that,
owing to the diﬀerence in costs, applications for short
visits are more likely to be successful than applications
for exchange grants.
Applications are reviewed quarterly after a submis-
sion deadline of 24:00 CET on 15 March, 15 June, 15
September, and 15 December. About 4-6 weeks after
each deadline, the ESF will inform applicants about the
outcome of evaluations.

TalkOrigins asks for donations
The TalkOrigins Archive Foundation (TOAF), a Texas
501(c)3 non-proﬁt organization, supports keeping evo-
lutionary science in public school science classrooms
and keeping religious antievolution out. Speciﬁ-
cally, the TOAF supports the online outreach of the
TalkOrigins Archive ( http://talkorigins.org ), TalkDe-
sign (http://talkdesign.org), and the Panda’s Thumb
weblog ( http://pandasthumb.org ).
In 2008, a antievolution propaganda ﬁlm starring Ben
Stein was released. “Expelled: No Intelligence Al-
lowed” from the production company Premise Media
was widely distributed. Since then, its claims have
been critiqued in prose and in video rebuttals. Recently,
Premise Media went bankrupt. The ﬁlm, “Expelled”,
and all the production materials are now up for auction.
The auction is being held online by Rosen Systems and
ends on Tuesday, June 28th.
The TOAF will undertake to bid on “Expelled”. We
hope to serve as a way for many individuals to col-
laborate in this eﬀort. If successful, we aim to give
as wide and as open a release of materials from “Ex-
pelled” as will be consistent with existing contractual
agreements (especially a distribution agreement in force
with Vivendi) and with the aim of making the pro-
paganda materials as little use as possible for the re-
ligious antievolutionists. We believe that the various
duplicitous strategems employed by Premise Media in
production of “Expelled” will be best rebutted in this
fashion. While there is no guarantee that the surviving
production materials will include statements linking re-
ligious motivations to the “academic freedom” label ap-
plied to the usual antievolution arguments, we believe
that it is our responsibility to make an eﬀort to obtain,
archive, and publish (within the constraints outlined
above) these materials. If such can be found within the
“Expelled” corpus, it would link many of the prominent
“intelligent design” advocates with a religious motiva-
tion in promoting their version of “academic freedom”
and could be as pivotal in future court cases as the Dis-
covery Institute’s “Wedge Document” was in the 2005
Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case.
In order to permit the TOAF to make as large a bid
as possible, we have been soliciting donations via Pay-56 EvolDir July 1, 2011
Pal. Because of delays in transfers, the TOAF can only
commit to bid funds available on hand as of Monday,
June 27th. Given the short time frame, we have not
been able to seek guidance on whether donations could
be refunded in the event that we are not able to make
a successful high bid. Thus, we want to be clear that
as things stand, donations should *not* be considered
refundable, and if we do not succeed in the auction
for “Expelled”, the funds would be used for the activ-
ities within the mission of the TOAF. For citizens of
the USA, donations to the TOAF are tax-deductible.
Again, the way I view this is to allow as many individ-
uals as possible to band together to participate in this
auction and, hopefully, preserve and expose its materi-
als to public scrutiny.
A more complete discussion of the policy on donations
to the TOAF is given by TOAF Treasurer Ken Fair
athttp://tinyurl.com/6aqgrqz . I have a blog post on
the topic at http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/-
06/help-talkorigin.html . Since announcing our intent
to bid late on June 23rd, people have donated several
thousand dollars to the TOAF. (I am not giving precise
ﬁgures at the moment since that would give competing
bidders too much information.) I concur with Ken Fair
when he says,
“I wanted to be clear about this because I do not want
anyone to donate to the Foundation if they feel uncom-
fortable doing so in any way. I certainly do not want
anyone contributing if they feel ﬁnancially strapped, or
they worry about what we will do with the funds. I do
recognize that people are putting their faith in us on
this matter - I take that very seriously, and I deeply
appreciate the response we have received thus far.”
I believe that we have an unprecedented opportunity
to investigate and document a signiﬁcant propaganda
eﬀort out of the religious antievolution community. I
hope that you will consider supporting the TOAF in
this endeavor.

Testing phylogeographical
hypotheses using coalescent
simulations
Dear all,I am attempting to use coalescent simulations to in-
fer recolonization scenarios for three-spine stickleback
in Britain and Ireland. To do so I am using a similar
approach to that suggested by Knowles & Maddison
(2002) Mol Ecol implemented in Mesquite.
Therefore I am modelling genealogies constrained
within hypothesis trees and then attempting to create
distributions of discordance statistics between a null
and an alternative hypothesis. I understand the the-
ory, but I am having some practical problems.
Essentially I am keen to make sure I am actually con-
ducting the coalescent analyses correctly. The bundled
tutorials are useful but do not quite go far enough
on testing biogeographical scenarios. I would be es-
pecially interested in any guidelines used for teaching
statistical phylogeography. Does anyone have a tuto-
rial/practical/protocol for using Mesquite in this way?
Many thanks in advance for any assistance

Thailand NatlParks
Hi all,
My name is Alyssa Stewart and I am a graduate stu-
dent at UMD, studying the evolutionary ecology of Old
World fruit bats. I am currently in southern Thailand
to conduct a pilot study for my dissertation research,
and was wondering if anyone has information, insights
or connections to any national parks in the area. I
am particularly interested in Thaleban National Park
and Ton Nga Chang Wildlife Sanctuary. Additionally,
any information about acquiring permits to conduct re-
search in Thai national parks, or export permits to take
plant samples out of Thailand, would be greatly appre-
ciated.
Many thanks in advance, Alyssa

ArabidopsisGenomeEvolution
Hi All,
The following postdoc ad outlines a position that would
be suitable for people interested in evolution of Ara-
bidopsis genomes and interested in mentoring UG re-
search in evolution/ecology.
thanks, Allan
We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher/teacher toﬁll a central role in the NSF-supported Undergraduate
Phenotyping of Arabidopsis Knowledgebase (UnPAK;
see description below) project.
The successful candidate will possess a PhD in the
biological sciences, have skills in database design and
maintenance, be enthusiastic about teaching part-time
in the College of Charleston Biology Department’s
ecology/evolution course sequence (details below) and
mentoring undergraduate researchers. An ideal candi-
date will also possess additional technical skills includ-
ing PCR-based methods, experience with plant growth
chamber or greenhouse growing methods (ideally in
Arabidopsis), and cyberinfrastructure/bioinformatics
capabilities.58 EvolDir July 1, 2011
This position oﬀers substantial opportunities in both
research and education, and would be ideal for an indi-
vidual who aspires to an academic career at an institu-
tion that embraces the teacher-scholar model. Individ-
uals who are most successful at these institutions often
bring experience in high-impact teaching and cutting-
edge scholarship with them when they apply - exactly
the experiences that will result from tenure as a UnPAK
postdoctoral researcher.
The UnPAK postdoc will have the ﬁrst chance to syn-
thesize genetic and phenotypic data as it is collected
and will be encouraged to pursue independent projects
within the context of the overall research program (use
of phenotypic eﬀects of T-DNA insertion mutants in
Arabidopsis to answer fundamental questions about
Arabidopsis genome structure and function across en-
vironments). There will be extensive opportunities
for professional networking during interactions among
partner institutions involved in the project (includ-
ing Barnard College, Hampden-Sydney, and U. Geor-
gia). In addition to Arabidopsis research opportuni-
ties, the UnPAK postdoc can be involved in collabo-
rative eﬀorts in building educational resources. This
postdoc will also have opportunities to learn about ed-
ucational research, as the UnPAK network will serve as
a context for understanding the impacts on undergrad-
uates of participating in a research network Initially,
teaching would be within the College of Charleston
course BIOL211, see http://catalogs.cofc.edu/pdf/-
Undergraduate Catalog 2011-2012.pdf, page 148. In-
quiries about this position can be sent to Matt
Rutter (rutterm@cofc.edu), Courtney Murren (mur-
renc@cofc.ed) or Allan Strand (stranda@cofc.edu). Ap-
plications should include a CV, a cover letter, and con-
tact information for 3 references and can be sent as
PDF ﬁles directly to Allan Strand (stranda@cofc.edu).
Review of applications will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is ﬁlled. The College of
Charleston is an Equal Opportunity/Aﬃrmative Ac-
tion Employer and encourages applications from women
and minorities.
A short overview of UnPAK The research community
has generated a set of T-DNA insertion lines aimed at
elucidating the functions of the ~27,000 genes in Ara-
bidopsis thaliana. These lines are thought to represent
“knockouts” of most A. thaliana genes, yet the vast ma-
jority display subtle if any morphological phenotypes.
This “absence of phenotype” phenomenon has been ob-
served in other model systems. In yeast, researchers
have turned their focus to characterizing performance
attributes of knockouts, such as population growth rate
and ﬁtness as well as the plasticity of these traits across
environments. This strategy has succeeded in ﬁndingphenotypic diﬀerences where none had been previously
observed. Given this proof of principle and its util-
ity for answering questions about genetic redundancy
and genomic evolution, we are applying a similar ap-
proach to the study of A. thaliana as a multicellular
and autotrophic model. We are doing so through col-
laboration among primarily undergraduate institutions
(PUIs), thus training future researchers in the process
of building a body of published work in genomics and
applied ecology and a network of collaborators.

Drosophila Genetics Postdoctoral Position Emory Uni-
versity, Atlanta, GA USA Laboratory of Dr. Todd
Schlenke
We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral re-
searcher to work on the genetics of Drosophila resis-
tance against parasitic wasps. Drosophila are a model
system for study of innate immunity, and wasps are
one of the most common pathogens of fruitﬂies in na-
ture. It is the interaction between the innate immune
response of the ﬂies and the venom of the wasps that
determines the outcome of any infection. We currently
have funding to use a combination of candidate gene
approaches, QTL mapping, and association mapping to
identify ﬂy loci that control resistance. The resistance
genes we identify will be functionally characterized us-
ing a variety of cell and molecular biology techniques,
and any history of adaptive evolution at such loci will
be determined with population genetic and molecular
evolution analyses. Applicants will preferably have a
background in some combination of Drosophila biology,
host-pathogen interactions, population genetics, genet-
ics, and molecular biology.
The Schlenke lab ( http://www.biology.emory.edu/-
research/schlenke/ ) is part of Emory’s Biology Depart-
ment ( http://www.biology.emory.edu/ ) and is aﬃliated
with the Genetics and Molecular Biology (GMB) and
Population Biology, Ecology and Evolution (PBEE)
graduate programs. These groups have a strong empha-
sis on host-pathogen interactions, Drosophila molecular
genetics, and bioinformatics, and we regularly collabo-
rate with multiple labs across campus. Atlanta is also
a great place to live.
Interested candidates should send a CV, along with
a brief statement of interests and experiences in the
above-mentioned areas, to Todd Schlenke by June 25th,
2011. Candidates can start any time between now and
January 2012.

Dear EvolDir community–
We have an opening for a postdoc to come work on
methods and applications in Bayesian phylogenetics.
This is an opportunity for you to bring your indepen-
dent research program to bear on novel data sets with
real-world consequences.
So far we have been working on methods to detect su-
perinfection in HIV with Julie Overbaugh’s group, and
evolutionary history of newly discovered heterochro-
matin genes in Drosophila with Harmit Malik’s group.
But there are a number of projects here that are cur-
rently waiting for a champion, such as:
* inference of “founder” sequences for SIV/HIV infec-
tion * high-throughput Bayesian phylogenomics meth-
ods for environmental sequence data * phylogeography
of cancer-causing viruses
We will provide you with a solid salary, computational
support, and a long list of interesting questions and

enzymes are critical component of the chemical de-
fensome and are highly expressed in liver. We have
heterologously expressed CYP1A, CYP1B1, CYP1C1,
CYP1C2, CYP1D1 and CYP3A65 from zebraﬁsh and
begun to characterize their function (Scornaienchi et
al 2010 Arch Biochem Biophys and Scornaienchi et al
2010 J Endocrinol). The expressed proteins will be ex-
amined in a high throughput screening laboratory to
identify possible substrates in a small molecule library.
Functional characterization of the CYP1 or CYP3 fam-July 1, 2011 EvolDir 63
ilies will lead to an understanding of structure-activity
relationships for these enzymes as well as evolution of
function within protein families. This research inter-
sects protein family evolution, molecular biology, bio-
chemistry and toxicology.
The successful candidate(s) will have a strong back-
ground in at least one of the key areas (evolution,
molecular biology, biochemistry and toxicology) and a
strong interest in interdisciplinary research. The suc-
cessful candidate should have strong research skills, ex-
perience in a molecular biology laboratory, be highly
motivated, and can work independently.

Department of Anthropology
Post-doctoral opportunities:
The complex genomic architecture of biological traits
and their evolution, with application to craniofacial de-
velopment and evolution
The Penn State Department of Anthropology involves
a widely recognized research program in developmen-
tal and evolutionary genetics. We collaborate with
local bioinformatics, computational biology, genomics,
and neuroscience centers. We are searching for post-
doctoral research scientists in three areas. The posi-
tions will integrate biological insight and analysis in-
volving existing software and programming of new ap-
plications (Linux & MacOS):
1. Evolutionary simulation and analysis of complex ge-
netic architecture. This project involves the use of a
forward evolutionary simulation package (ForSim) that
we have developed to simulate the genomic architecture
and evolution of complex traits such as neurologic dis-
ease and the morphogenesis of craniometric traits. How
well can this architecture be inferred by current meth-
ods such as whole-genome sequence or marker-based
GWAS or family data? Are there better criteria than
statistical signiﬁcance for understanding complex ge-
nomic causation? Script writing is essential, C++ pro-
gramming desirable.
2. Simulation of quantitative developmental morpho-
genesis. We are developing morphometric simulations
of the intercellular signaling interaction interactions
among tissues in craniofacial development and its evo-
lution. The goal is to generate &#8216;movies’ of
simulated tissue interactions and their resulting over-
all shape, that can be compared to morphometric data
from high-resolution MRI and CT imaging of normalJuly 1, 2011 EvolDir 65
and transgenic mouse models generated in our labo-
ratories. This position involves programming (current
modeling is in C++).
3. Bioinformatics/Genomic data analysis and mod-
eling. We are doing genomewide mapping on nor-
mal craniofacial variation in mouse and baboon mod-
els. This project involves the dissection of implicated
genome regions by integrating results from diﬀerent
species and other sources of externally derived infor-
mation such as regulatory networks and genomic se-
quence conservation. We relate these results to our
other work in neurologic and craniofacial dysgenesis
(Down syndrome, craniosynostosis). Ability to use
genome database and other bioinformatics resources is
required.
These integrated research projects have existing NSF
and NIH funding. We will be ﬁlling 1-year appoint-
ments, that can be extended to 2 or more years. Salary
will be NIH/NSF post-doctoral levels based on experi-
ence, and starting date can be any time. Penn State
is committed to aﬃrmative action, equal opportunity
and the diversity of its workforce and our group is al-
ready an appealing and successful mixture of diﬀerent
but collaborative people of various genders and cultural
backgrounds. Contact Ken Weiss (kenweiss@psu.edu)
or Joan Richtsmeier (jta10@psu.edu) for information,
or to apply submit CV and names of 3 potential per-
sons we could contact as references.

RibonucleotideReductaseEvol
Post-doctor in Astrobiology “Evolutionary and envi-
ronmental studies of the ribonucleotide reductase en-
zyme family” at the Department of Molecular Biology
and Functional Genomics/Astrobiology Centre. Ref-
erence number SU 619-1676-11. Deadline for applica-
tions: August 1, 2011.
At the Astrobiology Centre participates research groups
from the Departments of Geological Sciences, Molecular
Biology and Functional Genomics, Astronomy, Physics,
and Nordita at Stockholm University.
Project: Organisms store their genetic information in
the form of DNA. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) cat-
alyzes the sole de novo pathway that provides building
blocks for the DNA biosynthesis. RNR is an essential
enzyme in all free-living organisms and was a prereq-
uisite for DNA-based life on Earth. Diﬀerent classes
of RNR have diﬀerent oxygen requirements, and the
repertoire of RNR classes in an organism is therefore
likely to limit its ecological reach. The project involves
studies on the types and occurrences of RNR genes in
contemporary organisms and metagenomes to further
our understanding of the evolution of the RNR genes,
and the inﬂuence that environmental factors have on
their current distributions, e.g. via horizontal gene
transfer events.
Qualiﬁcations: PhD in molecular biologi with speciﬁc
emphases on microbiology and enzymology, and bioin-
formatic experience.
Terms of employment: The employment is fulltime
’post-doctoral researcher’ for one year and may be ex-tended for one additional year. Salaries at Stockholm
University are individually negotiated.
The Stockholm University is an equal opportunity em-
ployer.

Research and training post-doctoral position in malaria
vector ecology, Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania &
University of Glasgow, UK Ref: M00269
We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral re-
searcher who is committed to applying their expertise
in cutting-edge ecology and quantitative analyses to-
wards improving the prediction and control of malaria
vectors within the African settings where they impose
the greatest health burden.
This post has been generated through a new collabo-July 1, 2011 EvolDir 67
ration between the University of Glasgow, the Ifakara
Health Institute, Tanzania and the University of Cal-
ifornia, Davis. This individual will join a dynamic
team of mosquito vector biologists based at the Ifakara
Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania, an international
leader in the ﬁeld of malaria research. At the IHI, s/he
will lead the National Institute of Health, USA funded
project Ecological and genetic determinants of malaria
transmitting behaviours in the African vector Anophe-
les arabiensis.
The primary objective of this 5-year initiative is to iden-
tify the contribution of environmental and mosquito
genetic factors to variation in the mosquito feeding
and resting behaviours that determine their transmis-
sion ability and susceptibility to control measures. A
further objective is to assess the phenotypic and ge-
netic response of vector populations to the up-scaling of
control measures that target speciﬁc vector behaviours
(e.g. Insecticide-Treated Nets, targeting mosquitoes
that bite indoors at night) and evaluate evidence for
mosquito behavioural shifts in response to their use.
These issues will be investigated by the establishment
of longitudinal ﬁeld studies of mosquito vector behav-
ior, demography and transmission intensity within sev-
eral populations of the Kilombero Valley of Tanzania,
where the coverage of indoor-based mosquito control
measures is anticipated to signiﬁcantly rise throughout
the duration of the study.
In concert with directing the research activities of this
project, this individual will be responsible for leading
the development of research capacity in disease ecol-
ogy at the Ifakara Health Institute, through provision
of onsite supervision and training to high quality Tan-
zanian postgraduate students pursuing research associ-
ated with this project. By facilitating the transition of
these students to independent scientists through publi-
cation and presentation of their results, the candidate
will have opportunity to make a substantial contribu-
tion towards improving research capacity in malaria
vector management in Tanzania.

HumanEvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral position in Human Molecular Genetics
A postdoctoral position (two years at least) is available
in Connie Mulligan’s lab at the University of Florida.
Two NSF/NIH/UF-funded projects are currently
ongoing and the successful candidate can work on oneor both: 1) Examination of DNA methylation pat-
terns in mothers and newborns from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) to test whether epigenetic
alterations mediate the eﬀects of maternal exposure
to stressors on fetal development and neonatal health.
Speciﬁcally, we are testing if epigenetic modiﬁcations
may mediate changes in gene expression in infants
that result from maternal trauma and material de-
privation associated with the war in the DRC. More
broadly, we are interested in the idea that behavior
and complex phenotypes may be shaped by early
life experiences that alter gene expression through
epigenetic alterations. 2) Investigation of the genetic
and cultural underpinnings of complex diseases that
exhibit racial inequalities, using hypertension in
African-Americans as a model phenotype. We are
combining the analysis of genome-wide SNPs, genetic
ancestry estimates, and epigenetic variation with so-
ciocultural data including experience of discrimination
and social network analysis. By combining genetic
and socio-cultural data, our goal is a more compre-
hensive investigation of complex disease and racial
disparities than is possible with only one type of data.
See related study - http://www.plosone.org/article/-
info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006821
Qualiﬁcations: A PhD and a strong background in
generation of genetic data (DNA sequencing, SNP
detection, microarray analysis, etc.) and data analysis
(gene association analysis, regression analysis, genetic
ancestry estimation, etc) are essential. Experience gen-
erating methylation data or additional computational
experience (e.g. computer programming, simulation
analysis, etc) is a plus. In addition to the projects
listed above, there are excellent opportunities for the
successful candidate to develop new lines of research
as well as productive collaborations outside the lab.

UHawaii EvolutionGenetics
HawaiianDrosophila
Postdoctoral position: Evolutionary genetics, adapta-
tion and speciation in Hawaiian Drosophila.
A two-year postdoc position is available focusing on
genome level technology, (genome sequences, transcrip-
tome, QTLs, etc.) to study speciation and adaptation
in the planitibia group of Hawaiian Drosophila, particu-
larly the D. heteroneura D. silvestris ethological species
pair. Starting time is ﬂexible, between August 2011 to
February 2012.
Tropical Hawai’i is an unparalleled setting for the study
of terrestrial evolution. A perfect example of this is the
drosophilid species radiation. At least a third of the
2,000+ species in the world occur in Hawai’i, originat-
ing from a single introduction, the vast majority are
endemic to parts of the archipelago and contain some
of the most morphologically diverse Drosophila in the
world. The Hawaiian Drosophila are used as a prime
example in Dobzhansky’s famous essay “Nothing in Bi-
ology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution.”
I am looking for someone with a Ph.D. or equivalent
degree, with a high degree of familiarity in standard
molecular genetics laboratory experience (DNA extrac-
tion, quantiﬁcation, PCR, RT-PCR, cloning, trans-
formation, sequencing). Experience in working with
Drosophila is not essential and I would encourage appli-
cations from interested people in any relevant molecularbiology ﬁeld. Familiarity with population/evolutionary
genetics is a plus. Programming, simulation, analysis
experience with PERL, C, R and/or Mathematica is
a plus. Database experience, e.g. MySQL, is a plus.
This will be a ﬁrst position in a new group being es-
tablished by Floyd Reed, who is beginning in August
2011 (and to eventually move to a shared space that is
currently under renovation) in The Dept. of Zoology
(to merge and become The Dept. of Biology). I am
looking for someone that I and others can learn from
(e.g. microbiology techniques) as much as training in
population genetics. There will also be opportunity to
contribute to other planned projects, part of which will
be focused on genetically modifying wild populations,
with collaborative pilot experiments being planned in
Culex mosquitoes and avian malaria, other possible pi-
lot projects include DNA barcoding of Hawaiian diver-
sity, and the detection and analysis of demographic his-
tory and forms of positive selection in various species
using ABC approaches.
I do not discourage anyone from applying based on age,
sex, race, political views, nationality, etc. Applicants
will be selected based on scientiﬁc merit, e.g. a record
of publication, experience, etc.
The University of Hawai’i, Manoa is the main campus of
the Hawaiian state university system in the capital city

to parasitism in the relationship. The postdoctoral
researcher will investigate how antagonism can evolve
from cooperation when resource availability changes.
Tasks: Daily tasks will involve work in greenhouses,
laboratories and with fungal culturing. Researcher
must have an excellent knowledge of spoken/written
English. No prior knowledge of Dutch is required. Our
group is a multidisciplinary, international team of ecol-
ogists, evolutionary biologists and plant physiologists.
Requirements: Candidates should have a PhD in Bi-
ology, Ecology & Evolution, Microbiology, or related
ﬁelds, and a strong publication record. Experience in
molecular biology, evolutionary game theory, isotope la-
belling, rhizosphere studies and/or plant physiology is

Genomic approaches for aquatic species How can new
technologies help to improve breeding and sustainabil-
ity of farm aquatic resources? October 5, 2011 La
Rochelle
Context: Biotechnology evolves quickly oﬀering new
tools to researchers and producers to advance in the
knowledge of ﬁsh and molluscs’ genomics with applica-
tion in both ecology and production. AQUAGENET
is a cooperation project funded by INTERREG IVB
SUDOE program. Its main objective is to promoteJuly 1, 2011 EvolDir 85
the interaction between scientists and aquaculture sec-
tor in the SUDOE area to apply the new biotechnolo-
gies to the sector. This synergistic cooperation implies
an unique opportunity to join eﬀorts to improve the
competitiveness and development of aquaculture in this
area.
Topic of the workshop: Due to the recent domestication
history of aquatic species, the availability of applicable
genomic tools is still scarce, especially for some species
cultivated in the SUDOE area. Second generation se-
quencing technologies provide the means to rapidly in-
crease the availability of such tools. This workshop
will form a unique opportunity to gather researchers
from various ﬁelds and stakeholders around the com-
mon theme of applied next generation sequencing in
order to improve breeding and sustainability of farmed
aquatic species.
Provisional program: One day workshop divided in four
sessions, one dedicated to NGS technologies followed by
three sessions dedicated to their use in ﬁsh, molluscs
and their pathogens. Language of the workshop will be
English.
Registration will be free of charge; ﬁrst come ﬁrst
serve basis up to 100 participants. By e-mail only:
aquagenet.workshop@ifremer.fr , providing name and
aﬃliation, and whether you wish to propose a com-
munication. More information about AQUAGENET

Dear all,
it is my pleasure to announce to you that the following
RSEE course is now open for registration for all who
are interested:
Life History Theory (25 - 30 September 2011, Schier-
monnikoog, NL)
Organizers: Prof. Joost Tinbergen (RUG), Prof.
Jacques van Alphen (Emeritus RUL) Aim of the course
Life History Theory deals with species-speciﬁc adaptive
schemes of the distribution of the reproductive eﬀort
over the life of an organism. The general theoretical
problem is to predict which combination of traits will
evolve under speciﬁc conditions. The concepts used are
also relevant to study within species variation in life
history traits. The one week course aims at giving an
overview of the ﬁeld and will discuss methodology and
recent developments.
Contents & Structure The subject will be worked out
on the basis of lectures, case histories, discussion and
literature. Attention will be paid to various groups of
organisms such as birds, ﬁshes, insects and plants. The
contact with current research projects is guaranteed as
concrete examples will be treated by scientists working86 EvolDir July 1, 2011
in the ﬁeld. In poster sessions work and/or plans of the
participating students will be discussed with the whole
group and we will use computer practicals to illustrate
some of the concepts.

SocialComplexity Feb6-8
The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological
Synthesis (NIMBioS) is now accepting applications for
its Investigative Workshop, “Modeling Social Complex-
ity,”* *to be held February 6-8, 2012, at NIMBioS. The
workshop is co-sponsored by the National Evolutionary
Synthesis Center.
Objectives:* * The great majority of humans today live
in complex societies, which can exist only on a basis of
extensive cooperation among large numbers of individ-
uals. Ultrasociality, the ability of humans to cooper-
ate in large groups of genetically unrelated individuals,
presents a puzzle to both evolutionary and social the-
ory. The workshop aims to bring together a diverse
group of modelers with anthropologists, archaeologists
and other social scientists to synthesize the state of
knowledge in formal models of the evolution of socialcomplexity, to identify unresolved issues, and to set an
agenda for future collaborative work. The workshop
will be organized around the following general themes:
What theories and data are available? What are the
empirical patterns that cannot be explained by the ex-
isting theories and data? How can we adapt existing
models to make full use of the available data? What
kinds of data are needed to better inform the models?
What new modeling techniques and methods need to
be developed? In so doing, we aim to achieve a true
dialogue between modelers and empiricists.
Location:* *NIMBioS at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville
Co-Organizers:* * Peter Turchin (Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology, Univ. of Connecticut, Storrs);

Trento, Italy.
REGISTRATION AND ABSTRACT SUBMISSION
WILL CLOSE JUNE 30th
All relevant information, including registration and
abstract forms, can be found at: http://pgac3.fem-
environment.eu/ Brief description The Third edition
of the workshop will be focussed on a well-recognized,
yet unsolved issue in conservation genetics: how to
bridge the gap between scientists and end-users, i.e.
non-scientists such as policymakers, administrators, or
park rangers that are directly involved in animal con-
servation and would like to design, implement and/or
apply management and conservation plans using the
most modern strategies and tools
Therefore, this workshop intends addressing this gap by
focussing on ﬁve main themes identiﬁed as top priori-
ties during a recent survey conducted by the European
consortium ConGRESS of 100 end-users from across
Europe:
1) Identifying units for conservation 2) Population con-
nectivity and isolation 3) Reconstructing past popula-
tion dynamics 4) Detecting and planning translocations
and reintroductions 5) Genetic diversity and adapta-
tion Each theme will be tackled in one 2-hour session(with lectures from invited speakers and contributions
from attendees) with ﬁnal-day round tables discussions
where scientists and end-user will have the opportunity
to examine, vis-a-vis, unresolved issues and possible so-
lutions.
PGAC III hopes to bring together researchers from dif-
ferent ﬁelds (e.g. population genetics, ecology, conser-
vation biology and related) and end-users with basic
scientiﬁc knowledge and a strong desire to know more
about applying population genetics tools to their par-
ticular conservation problem. The major aim will be
to promote an eﬀective interaction, using a common
language, to fully exploit the potential of population
genetics as applied to animal conservation.

Lammi Biological Station, University of Helsinki, Fin-
land
REGISTRATION WILL CLOSE NEXT WEEK
(JUNE 30TH)
Short description: Advancing our understanding how
organisms adapt to environmental variation lies at the
core of ecology and evolutionary biology, and has be-
come especially relevant in the light of current human-
induced environmental change as a major threat to
global biodiversity. When predicting species’ responses
to climate change, including range shifts and adapta-
tion, it is crucial to take into account spatial patterns
of local adaptation and population dynamics at the re-
gional and geographical scale.
We organize a conference ( ~60 participants) with a pri-
mary focus on adaptation to environmental variation,
in particular climatic and thermal adaptation, from
a spatial perspective at the regional and geographic
level. We intend to bring together current high-quality
research at multiple levels of investigation, includingJuly 1, 2011 EvolDir 89
ecology, evolutionary genetics, physiology, theory and
conservation. We aim to combine studies including a
broad range of organisms, including plants, vertebrates
and aquatic organisms, but with a main focus on ec-
totherms.
The conference will be organised around three main
sessions: - Latitudinal and altitudinal clinal variation
- Landscape/metapopulation approaches to ecological
and evolutionary dynamics - Ecological and evolution-
ary dynamics at the range margins
Keynote speakers: - Dr. Jon Bridle (University of Bris-
tol, UK) - Prof. Klaus Fischer (Greifswald University,

*Background and aims* Plants are intimately associ-
ated with both microbes and insects. This gives rise
to three-way interactions that have far-reaching con-
sequences for the functioning and evolution of the or-
ganisms involved. After the initial disparate develop-
ment of the ﬁelds of plant pathology and entomology,
the past decades have brought fascinating insights as
researchers started to address questions like: how do
microbial symbionts/antagonists aﬀect interactions be-
tween plants and herbivorous insects and vice versa ?
To what extent are the patterns of activation of defense
signalling pathways shared between diﬀerent guilds of
microorganisms and insects ? Are there predictable
patterns in synergistic and antagonistic interactions be-
tween these players ? What are the consequences of
alterations of herbivorous insect behaviour by their en-
dosymbionts/pathogens ? We think the current chal-
lenge is to understand the ecological relevance of these
interactions and their role in the functioning of plants
in their multitrophic environment.
The aim is to bring together molecular and ecological
researchers from this emerging ﬁeld to give impetus to
research on ecological and evolutionary implications of
such three-way interactions and stimulate cross-talk be-
tween experts from the diﬀerent subdisciplines of my-
corrhiza, rhizobia, endophyte, viral/ fungal/ bacterial
pathogen eﬀects on insects and vice versa.
The workshop will be a ﬁrst step towards starting up a
European research network, and facilitate participants
to explore new research areas and future collaborations,
develop research plans to be submitted to the EU and
other funding agencies, and explore potential topics for
joint review papers.
*Participants* We aim at a group of circa 20-25 work-
shop participants. Eighteen invited participants origi-nate from NL, DK, UK, GER, SP, CH, FIN. This call
is for the remaining ca. 5 seats. We encourage appli-
cation by participants from EU countries not yet cov-
ered above, working in the ﬁelds of plant-endophyte,
-rhizobium, -pathogen, -mycorrhiza, and -insect inter-
actions, and across the research disciplines of ecology,

for Haemosporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates1
**The workshop is likely to be of interest to evolution-
ary biologists as it will center around the systematics
of a very successful and diverse group of parasites of
natural vertebrate populations and include laboratory
exercises involving phylogenetic analysis of parasite lin-
eages and readings and discussions on the evolutionary
history of the parasites including cospeciation of hosts
and parasites as well as the evolution of virulence.
Dear Colleagues,
The NSF-sponsored Research Coordination Network
for Haemosporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (Malari-
aRCN) is pleased to announce our ﬁrst annual work-
shop on the malaria parasites and closely related
haemosporidians of natural populations of vertebrates.
The four day workshop will include both ﬁeld and lab-
oratory exercises as well as lectures and discussions led
by RCN members2.
Topics to be covered through the workshops exer-
cises include vertebrate and invertebrate ﬁeld capture
techniques, blood sampling and preparation of blood
smears, vector identiﬁcation and salivary gland prepa-
ration, sample vouchering and cryopreservation, light
microscopy for parasite species identiﬁcation and para-
site and cell counts, DNA extraction and PCR screen-
ing of parasites, sequence data analysis including phy-July 1, 2011 EvolDir 91
logenetics, and databasing. Discussion topics will in-
clude, but are not limited to, the basic biology, phylo-
genetics and systematics of Haemosporida, community
ecology of parasites, coevolution ofparasites and hosts,
the evolution of virulence, and conservation and dis-
ease.

tion Training Center in Shepherdstown, West Virginia,
a site easily accessible through Washington, D.C., area
airports.
The workshop is geared towards graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, and other investigators new
to the ﬁeld of wildlife haemosporidians. We are cur-
rently accepting applications and encourage individu-
als from outside the United States, particularly from
developing countries. Funding is available to cover the
workshop cost, accommodation at the Shepherdstown
facility, transportation from the Washington Dulles In-
ternational airport (IAD), and meals for all partici-
pants. Additional funds may be available to help with
travel costs. Application forms can be requested fromthe workshop organizers (email: MalariaRCNWork-
shop@gmail.com). Additional information on the work-
shop including an overview of the four days of events
will soon be made available on the oﬃcial workshop
website ( http://malariarcn.org/ ). Decisions on partic-
ipation will begin on Monday May 30th and continue
until the workshop is ﬁlled. If interested, you are en-
couraged to apply for the workshop as soon as possible.
1 The Research Coordination Network for Haemo-
sporida of Terrestrial Vertebrates (RCN), sponsored
by the U. S. National Science Foundation and funded
through 2015 at the University of Missouri-St. Louis,
was established to promote communication among re-
searchers working on the ecology and evolution of
haemosporidian parasites of vertebrate wildlife popu-
lations.
2 Workshop organizers include Ellen Martinsen (Smith-
sonian Institution), Staﬀan Bensch (Lund University),
Ravinder Sehgal (San Francisco State University),
Carter Atkinson (USGS), and Gediminas Valkiunas
(Nature Research Center, Vilnius). Other members of
this RCN include Robert Ricklefs and Patricia Parker
(University of Missouri V St. Louis), Robert Fleischer
(Smithsonian Institution), Susan Perkins (American
Museum of Natural History), Tom Smith(University of
California, Los Angeles), and Robert Adlard (Queens-
land Museum).

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category92 EvolDir July 1, 2011
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
