POPULATION GENOMICS OF FUNGAL AND
OOMYCETE PATHOGENS OF ANIMALS AND

Monte Verita Conference Center, Ascona, Switzerland
Conference website: http://www.path.ethz.ch/-
education/population-genomics-of-fungal-and-oom
ycete-diseases-of-animals-a.html
Conference email inquiries to: ascona 2017@usys.ethz.chCONFERENCE OVERVIEW:
The population genomics of fungal and oomycete
pathogens is a rapidly growing area of research. New
datasets, new sequencing methodologies and new an-
alytical methods are enabling a deeper understanding
of the evolutionary processes driving the emergence of
fungal and oomycete pathogens. This conference aims
to enrich our understanding of the processes driving the
evolution of plant, animal and human pathogens, with
an over-riding goal of identifying the genomic changes
responsible for adaptation to novel hosts and environ-
ments. A secondary goal will be to determine how the
relevant genes (and their underlying functions) vary
along ecological/agronomic gradients associated with
host specialization, including quantitative adaptation to
host resistance. The conference will be oriented around
genome-based approaches, including; 1) using popula-
tion genomics to understand pathogen emergence and
host specialization, 2) using genome-wide association
studies to identify key genes and genomic regions associ-
ated with pathogen local adaptation, 3) using populationOctober 1, 2016 EvolDir 3
genomics to understand pathogen divergence/speciation,
4) developing new analytical methods for population
genomic analyses.

Lisbon Portugal EvoDevo Nov9-11
It is our pleasure to invite you to the Neptune Evo
Devo Symposium, which will take place on 9th-11th
November 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal.
The Neptune Evo Devo Symposium is organized by the
Neptune Network students, a Marie Curie-funded Euro-
pean project with focus on evo devo and neurobiology
of marine animal models.
Speakers will cover topics including evolution of the
nervous system and evolution of body plans. In line
with Neptune's core interest, emphasis will be put on
marine organisms, though not exclusively, and on recent
technologies which are becoming increasingly suitable
for use in non-model organisms, e.g. CRISPR genome
editing and Light Sheet Microscopy, enabling broader
comparative studies.
This symposium aims to attract enthusiastic, interna-
tional scientists, as well as to foster interactions between
communities. It will be a friendly event, in which par-
ticipants will be able to present their work (short talks
or poster sessions) and to exchange with leading re-
searchers.

*GENETICS OF MIGRATION* Tuesday 4th April -
Friday 7th April 2017 Venue: Max Planck Institute of
Evolutionary Biology, Pl on, Germany
We are pleased to announce that a symposium on the
Genetics of Migration will be held at the Max Planck
Institute of Evolutionary Biology (Pl on, Germany) in
spring 2017 (April 4th-7th).
The aim of the symposium is to bring together a multi-
disciplinary group of scientists working on the ecology,
genomics, epigenetics, evolutionary theory and biostatis-
tics of animal migration. The development of next
generation sequencing technology and improvements in
tracking the movement of migratory species is certain
to advance this eld of science in the coming years so
now is an excellent time to synthesize what we currently
understand about the genetic basis of migration as well
as highlight future avenues of research. The symposium
will be based on a series of talks, posters, workshops
and discussions and will encompass a wide range of
migratory taxa including birds, sh and insects.

event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE.
Send applications by e-mail to
(YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com), sup-
plying your name, contact address and stating whether
or not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than Friday 28 October 2016. The body text
should not exceed 150 words in length. Title, authors,
and their professional aliations should be included
with the abstracts. If the presentation is co-authored,
the actual speaker (oral) or presenter (poster) must be
clearly indicated in BOLD text. If you have presented a
talk at the YSF before, we ask that you submit only for
a poster presentation, as speaker slots are limited and
we want to give as many people a chance as possible.
Similarly, if you are presenting at both the YSF and
MF, we ask that you not apply for speaking slots in
both (or let us know so we can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

Nov7-8 RegistrationOpen
Dear all,
Registration is now open for the Symposium on the
\Origins and Natural History of the Scandinavian Biota"
taking place 7-8 November 2016, at the Swedish Museum
of Natural History in Stockholm.
The deadline for registration is on October 16th.
Scandinavia was covered by a large ice sheet during the
last glacial maximum, which means most modern-day
animals, plants and humans have a recent origin in the
region. But their origins and subsequent history have
until recently remained unresolved.
The Swedish Museum of Natural History invites you
to a symposium where some of the world's leading
researchers in genetics, paleobiology and archaeology
present the latest research results on the origins and
natural history of the Scandinavian biota.
The following speakers will present their research: Inger

Call for Abstracts Species in the Age of Discordance
University of Utah Department of Philosophy Annual
Conference Series March 23rd - 25th 2017 Salt Lake
City, Utah
The University of Utah Department of Philosophy cor-
dially invites submissions of abstracts or prospecti (up to
1000 words) for paper and poster presentations at our up-
coming conference ?Species in the Age of Discordance?.12 EvolDir October 1, 2016
Submissions should be prepared for blind review and
uploaded at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=-
3Dsitaod2017. Please be sure to indicate whether your
submission is for a paper or a poster. The submission
deadline is Nov. 15, 2016.
Biological lineages move through time, space, and each
other. As they do, they diversify, diverge, and grade
away from and into one another. One result of this is
genealogical discordance, i.e., the lineages of a biologi-
cal entity may have dierent histories. We see this on
numerous levels, from microbial networks, to holobionts,
to population-level lineages.
The focus of this project is whether and how genealogi-
cal and other sorts of biological discordance impact our
views on species. Other kinds of relevant discordance
might include geographic discordance due to habitat
fragmentation and human mediated dispersal of species
in new environments, discordant government policies
which aect populations that straddle or migrate across
international borders, and discordant use of language
or theoretical terms between researchers in dierent
disciplines.
To promote a cross-disciplinary examination of this ques-
tion, investigators from a variety of elds will participate
in a series of interdisciplinary meetings. This includes
researchers working on phylogenetics, microbiology, sym-
biosis, population genetics, taxonomy, philosophy, and
history.
The Utah meeting is the rst of three meetings on this
topic. Follow up sessions are tentatively planned for
the 2017 Evolution Meeting (Portland, OR) and the
2017 ISHPSSB Meeting (Sao Paulo, Brazil). The Utah
meeting will be a mix of invited and refereed papers
and posters.

tions, please contact dan.molter@utah.ed or

and Time".
This conference will cover a wide range of topics at
the crossroads of conservation biology, biogeography,
macroecology, evolution and global change. Suitable
presentations may include various approaches and an-
alytical methods that explain patterns of abundance,
distribution and diversity from genes to ecosystems,
and ecosystem services. We particularly encourage the
submissions of interdisciplinary studies (including socio-
ecological studies and studies on historical (palaeonto-
logical) biodiversity), submissions that propose novel
approaches, and submissions that advance or test recent
concepts and theories.
We especially encourage young and early career re-
searchers to submit their abstracts. Submission dead-
line is the 1st December 2016. For more informa-
tion and updates please check out the website http://-

of Natural History.
The Global Biodiversity Genomics Conference will bring
together thought leaders, researchers, and academics
who are leading the charge in applying genomic tech-
nologies to understand all of life. The conference will be
one of the rst to address the transition from a scientic
emphasis on human genomics to one on global biodiver-
sity genomics, as investigations in this arena are rapidly
on the increase. The meeting will also focus on inter-
actions and synergies among biodiversity researchers,
computational scientists, sequencing technologists, and
software developers.
The conference will have sessions that cover a broad
array of relevant topics, including specic evolutionary
and ecological questions and the genomics of broad tax-
onomic groups (e.g. plants, vertebrates, invertebrates,
and microbes) as well as critical technological and ana-
lytical tools.
The conference is being planned in conjunction with
major genomics initiatives, such as G10K (https://-
genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/), GIGA (http://giga-cos.org/-
), i5K (http://arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/i5K), and
the Global Genome Initiative (http://ggi.si.edu/). Pre14 EvolDir October 1, 2016

33. Ancient DNA for understanding past biodiver-
sity, human history, and drivers of ecosystem changes:
achievements, limits and perspectives Co-conveners:
Charline Giguet-Covex (University of York), Laura Epp
(Alfred Wegener Institute), Isabelle Domaizon (Institut
National de la Recherche Agronomique) and Inger Greve
Alsos (Troms University Museum)
Use of ancient DNA (aDNA) has made a major con-
tribution to our understanding of past ecosystems and
human history. Recent studies have for instance ad-
dressed ecosystem and population changes both in rela-
tion to climatic and anthropogenic factors, as well as the
history of agro-pastoral activities. However, compared
with other proxies, it is still in its infancy in particular
for its application to continuous sedimentary records.
Hence, whereas, in theory, it can oer to directly iden-
tify organisms living in the surrounding of the archive
down to species level, and even capture intraspecic
or morphologically cryptic variants, we still know little
about to what extent the biota is actually represented
in the DNA records. Especially, biases or imprecisions
related to both taphonomic processes and analytical
procedures are not yet fully understood.
In this session, we will bring together specialists using
aDNA applied to sediments and bones to study the his-
tory of ecosystems and populations in dierent contexts
(e.g. ecology, genetics, archaeology). In particular, we
welcome contributions showcasing methodological devel-
opments of aDNA analyses, to understand and account
for taphonomic processes and biases. Contributions
integrating dierent kinds of data and considering the
dierent spatial and/or temporal scales of these analyses
are also highly appreciated.

1. Studying the eect of fear on social networks in a
wild rock hyrax population. The goal of this project is
to learn how social networks change in response to per-
ceived elevation in predation risk. We will use a range
of methods to simulate high predation risk, and will
record the eect on the social network using proximity
sensors.
Requirements: - Behavioral ecology background. - Ex-
perience in eldwork, preferably with mammals in warm
climate. - Willingness to spend 5 months every yearin a eld station in Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, Israel. -
Excellent data analysis skills, preferably using R.
2. Fitness consequences of social network dynamics.
This is a theoretical project that is aimed at extend-
ing previous work (http://www.nature.com/articles/-
ncomms12084) on the fundamental structure of social
networks. We will simulate social network dynamics
to identify how several factors such as environmental
eects and individual traits aect social structure; and
how in turn the social structure contributes to variation
in survival and reproductive success.
Requirements: - Background in computational biology.
- Prociency in at least one programming language.

CornellU FisheriesGenomics
The lab of Nina Overgaard Therkildsen in the Depart-
ment of Natural Resources at Cornell University is look-
ing for a highly motivated PhD student to start in the
fall of 2017.
Research in the lab focuses on how contemporary en-
vironmental change and human impacts shape demo-
graphic, ecological, and microevolutionary processes
within marine species. We are particularly interested in
how human activities cause rapid evolution in many wild
populations and in the roles that ongoing genetic adap-
tation and geographic distribution shifts will play for
species persistence in our rapidly changing world. Our
core tools to address these questions are high-throughput
DNA sequencing methods that are opening completely
new opportunities for population genomic studies of
non-model organisms. A cornerstone of our research is
to analyze time series of genomic data, which allow for
direct tracking of changes over known time scales and
therefore provide a unique opportunity to observe recent
dynamics and microevolution in retrospective real time.October 1, 2016 EvolDir 17
Insights gained through this approach can also be impor-
tant for characterizing population structure in exploited
species, and we are working actively to develop ways to
use genomic analysis for improving marine conservation
and sheries management.|
PhD students will have the opportunity to develop their
own project that aligns with the overarching lab interests
or to join ongoing projects relating to sheries-induced
and climate-driven adaptation (based on experimen-
tal data and historical samples collected from wild sh
stocks), harnessing genomic data for better delineation
of biologically relevant units for sheries management,
and estimation of contemporary connectivity between
populations.
Applicants should have a strong background and interest
in evolutionary biology, sheries, population genetics,
bioinformatics or a related eld. Familiarity with molec-
ular laboratory techniques, computational skills and
previous experience working with large genomic data
sets will be advantageous. However, the most important
qualications are enthusiasm, drive, excellent written
and oral communication skills, and demonstrated ability
to work independently as well as in collaborative teams.
Interested candidates should send an email describ-
ing their motivation and research interests along with
a CV, GPA, GRE scores (if available), and names
of three references to Nina Overgaard Therkildsen
(nt246@cornell.edu). Qualied candidates will be con-
tacted to apply for sponsored admission through the
Cornell Graduate Field of Natural Resources by De-
cember 1, 2016. Funding for the position is available
through research assistantships, teaching assistantships,
and university fellowships, but candidates will also be
encouraged to apply for external fellowships (in-progess
fellowship applications will be viewed very favorably).
The Natural Resources Graduate Program oers an ex-
citing inter-disciplinary environment for graduate train-
ing with ample opportunity for interaction with the
vibrant and diverse research community across the Cor-
nell campus.|

SharkPopulationGenomics
PhD Scholarship in Population Genomics of tiger sharks
A PhD Scholarship in Population Genomics of tiger
sharks is available at the National Institute of Aquatic
Resources (DTU Aqua) with starting time December
2015. The project will be carried out in aliation to the
Section for Marine Living Resources' population genet-
ics research group in Silkeborg, Denmark. DTU Aqua
is an institute at the Technical University of Denmark.
The purpose of DTU Aqua is to provide research, advice
and education at the highest international level within
the sustainable exploitation of living marine and fresh-
water resources, the biology of aquatic organisms and
the development of ecosystems as well as their integra-
tion in ecosystem-based management. The institute has
an international research sta comprising approx. 120
academic employees.
Project description Knowledge of species responses to
past environmental changes is vital for understanding
current patterns of biodiversity. In this context, col-
lections of archived specimens in museums and other
repositories represent exclusive DNA \log-books" for cli-
mate change research. Virtually nothing is known about
the genetic impact of past environmental changes and ex-
ploitation on sharks and other elasmobranchs, which are
keystone species for healthy marine ecosystems. Shark
jaws are abundant in museums and as trophies with
recreational anglers constituting one of the world's most
abundant sources of DNA for retrospective genetic analy-
sis. However, until now the potential of genomic analysis
of these unique samples remain largely unexplored. The
aim of this project is to apply cutting edge genomic tools
to abundant samples of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier)
in order to describe historical changes in population
distribution, abundance and evolutionary response to
global change and exploitation. The project will com-
prise sample collection of archived tiger and possibly
white sharks in Australia. The majority of molecular
genomic work, bioinformatics and population genomics
analyses will be conducted at DTU Aqua in Denmark,
in tight collaboration with researchers at University
of Queensland, Australia. Accordingly, the applicant
should have an interest in working in an international
atmosphere in the interphase between basic and applied
research.18 EvolDir October 1, 2016
Qualications We are looking for a candidate who has:
* Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Aquatic Science
& Technology or similar
* Experience in population genetics/genomics
* Experience with bioinformatics will be advantageous
* Prociency in written and spoken English
* Keen interest in research within a eld combining

graduate students in Fall 2017. The lab is broadly
interested in evolutionary, ecological and behavioral
genetics and genomics. Our goal is to understand
how natural selection, mediated by the physical,
biological, and social environment, interacts with other
evolutionary processes to maintain genetic diversity in
ecologically important traits. We want to know how
much of the ubiquitous genetic diversity in natural
populations is adaptive and how much is non-adaptive,
and we are interested in the consequences of both kinds
of variation for individuals, populations, and species.
We work mainly with natural populations of poeciliid
sh and fruit ies, but are open to students who wish
to study other organisms. We use techniques that
include eld studies, lab and eld experiments, and
genetic, genomic and behavioral analysis. Students
are encouraged to develop their own projects within
this broad framework. Current student projects
include investigating the interaction of inheritance
and social environment in determining alternative
male life histories in mollies, the genetic and genomic
consequences of sexual selection and mate preference
in guppies; genetic, social, and physiological modiers
of aggression and dominance in mosquitosh, and the
genetics and evolution of immunity and aging in fruit
ies.

LobsterPopulationGenetics
PhD project opportunity: Population connectivity,
adaptation and dispersal in rock lobsters (PhD top up
scholarship available) (James Cook University, Queens-
land, Australia)
Spiny rock lobsters are commercially important species
with extremely long larval dispersal phases (up to 24months). Because there are no obvious barriers to dis-
persal within the world's oceans, species with extremely
long larval durations would be expected to have sin-
gle, large open' (or panmictic) populations. Surpris-
ingly, recent studies have detected signicant population
structure in this species however the processes under-
pinning this unexpected population genetic structure
and allopatric species distributions are unknown. Local
adaptation and self-recruitment are likely to play an
important role in shaping the demography of marine
lobsters because they can counteract the impact of an
extremely long larval duration.
This PhD project will employ population genomic se-
quencing technologies with unparalleled spatial and tem-
poral sampling to identify the factors shaping genetic
structure in the commercially important spiny rock lob-
sters. This project will seek to:
- discover the factors causing ne-scale population dif-
ferentiation within these species by examining the con-
tribution of a) sweepstake reproduction, b) larval cohe-
siveness, c) self- recruitment and d) selection
- detect local adaptation by identifying signatures of
adaptive genetic diversity a) within disjunct populations
and b) at range margins, comparing these to central
parts of the distribution
The PhD project will be co-supervised by Assoc. Prof.
Jan Strugnell (James Cook University) and Dr Nick
Murphy (La Trobe University).
Requirements: The successful applicant will have a First
Class Honours (or equivalent) in biological science or a
related eld and will pick up extra points in the scoring
system if they have a rst authored paper. Applicants
must be eligible for an Australian Postgraduate Award
(APA). Preference will be given to those applicants with
previous experience in genetics and/or evidence of strong
technical and laboratory skills. Journal publications in
these elds are desirable but not essential. A top-up
( $5,190) per year for three years are available for this
project.

demonstrate genome-wide consequences. Anticipated
outcomes include innovative genetic rescue protocols and
a framework for genetic rescue, with excellent science
and leading-edge conservation training. The expected
benets will be increased persistence of species that
are otherwise unresponsive to management, and aims
to provide a new path to saving endangered species.

The project will be conducted under the umbrella of an
Australian Research Council Linkage project for 2017-20
(LP160100482 Sunnucks P, Morgan J, Lintermans M,
Magrath M, Sinclair S, Coates D, Young A, Kilian A,
Beitzel M. Genetic rescue of Australian wildlife). In this
project, three universities (Monash University, La Trobe
University and University of Canberra) have teamed up
with nationwide partners with a wide range of skills
and responsibilities for wildlife, including Victorian De-
partment of Environment, Land, Water and Planning
(DELWP), Diversity Arrays Technology, Zoos Victoria,
Environment and Planning Directorate (ACT Govern-
ment), Department of Parks and Wildlife (WA) and
CSIRO.
The PhD candidate will work in this multidisciplinary
team investigating the genetic rescue of threatened
species. The projects will involve biology, genomic anal-
ysis and conservation planning. The candidates will con-
duct excellent science publishable in top journals while
engaging with hands-on conservation actions with lead-
ing institutions. There will be opportunity to develop
independent questions within the major goals of the
program - to conduct and monitor experimental genetic
rescue and develop protocols for it within a framework of
long-term species management. The project is expected
to yield improved potential of threatened populations
to persist and adapt to changing environments, and will
provide novel insights into how genetic rescue works in
populations and the genomes of individuals.

MonashU 2 EvolutionBehaviour
PhD scholarships to study free-living tropical fairy-
wrens At the Behavioural and Evolutionary Ecology
of Birds Group at Monash University, Melbourne, Aus-
tralia, two PhD positions are available. Both projects
will use our fully colour-banded known-age population
with a wealth of information on life-history of individ-
ual birds. Field work takes place at AWC MorningtonWildlife Sanctuary in the Kimberley, a beautiful region
in the monsoonal tropics of north-west Australia.
Project 1. \Genetic and environmental eects on suc-
cess and aging" This project will use quantitative ge-
netics models combined with our 7 generation pedigree
and available data and existing samples to disentan-
gle environmental and genetic eects on components
of life-history and tness. This student will investigate
how performance in purple-crowned fairy-wrens changes
with age and senescence (using telomere length as an
indicator of remaining life-span), and how this relates
to their genetic background, early-life and environmen-
tal conditions. For this project, strong interest in, and
talent for, quantitative analyses are a must.
Project 2. \The function of female ornamental breed-
ing plumage" This project will investigate the function
of the female seasonal breeding plumage. Female or-
namental plumages are fairly common, although they
are less well understood than male ornaments. Female
purple-crowned fairy-wrens are highly unusual in that
they develop a distinctive seasonal breeding plumage.
The student will test hypotheses of sexual and social
selection against the background of what we know about
seasonal plumages in male fairy-wrens. The student will
analyse existing and to-be-collected data on plumage
development, plumage reectance (colour) and repro-
ductive success, and use recently developed 3D models
to experimentally test predictions.
Requirements and further information Students must
have self-motivation, enthusiasm, a background in ecol-
ogy and evolutionary theory, a passion for studying wild
animals in their natural environment, a strong work
ethic, experience with (tropical) eldwork and/or bird
handling and/or relevant quantitative skills. The stu-
dent will have considerable exibility in developing the
project.
In order to be eligible, students must have four-year
degree with relevant research experience, outstanding
grades, and excellent English. Successful students will be
oered a scholarship (and fee-waiver in the case of inter-
national students) of approximately AU $ $26,000 AUD,
tax-free for 3.5 years, for full time research. Expenses
for research, coursework, and conference attendance are
covered.
Starting date is negotiable, between Jan and June 2017.

PlantConservationGenetics
A MSc position in evolutionary and ecological conserva-
tion genetics is available to study local adaptation of the
perennial native prairie plant, Prairie Smoke with Jill
Hamilton at North Dakota State University in Fargo,
North Dakota.
Identifying the appropriate seed sources for restoration
eorts can be challenging, particularly for geographi-
cally isolated populations where historical isolation or
contemporary fragmentation may have contributed to
dierentiation in adaptive traits across a species range.
In this project we are investigating the genetic basis
of adaptation in Prairie Smoke (Geum triorum) plant
populations. Prairie Smoke is an herbaceous perennial
that has a wide geographic distribution spanning muchof contemporarily fragmented midwestern prairies, but
it is also common to disjunct alvar habitats around the
Great Lakes region. Alvar habitats are characterized
by thin layers of soil over limestone that harbor unique
assemblages of plants that are largely isolated from the
core of their continuous range.
The ideal MS student will be prepared to conduct eld-
based research in a common garden experiment that
has been established in Minnesota, with an opportunity
to expand locations. There is plenty of room to pursue
particular interests in adaptive trait variation depending
on the interest and experience of the candidate. The
student will also be involved in outreach activities asso-
ciated with the project engaging local state and NGO
stakeholders in applied research.
For more information on the Hamilton Lab please
visit the lab website at: http://www.jillahamilton.com
and more information on the Department of Biological
Sciences at NDSU at https://www.ndsu.edu/biology/.
Fargo is the largest city in the northern Midwest and as
'Gateway to the West' is a vibrant, growing community
that has access to numerous outdoor opportunities for
all seasons.
Interested students are encouraged to contact Dr. Hamil-
ton (jill.hamilton@ndsu.edu). Please include a brief de-
scription of your research interests and experience and
a CV in your email. Funding options are available for
both US students and international students.

Hello,
Please nd below the description of a doctoral position
(PhD) to search for unknown environmental sequences
of medical/biological interest using large sequence simi-
larity networks.
We are oering a 3 year doctoral position, starting asap,
ideally on october the 15th 2016.
Summary of the project:
Our knowledge on the evolution of important gene fam-
ilies etc. have so far largely relied on the comparative
analysis of sequences from cultured microbial organisms
and their MGE, both from a medical and from a more
fundamental perspective. For example, the drug resis-
tance genes we know, or the DNA and RNA polymerases,
or ribosomal subunits we know, were mostly studied
in organisms with cultured genomes, which represent
a fraction of Life on Earth. The conservation, rate of
transfer, mutation or recombination rates, and Ka/Ks
ratio of these sequences have notably been investigated,
suggesting which gene families are more conserved, and
which ones are more evolvable. Importantly, the growing
amount of molecular data from environmental samples
or single cells (with the current development of single cell
metagenomics) is now providing important additional
data to test whether genetic diversity in environmental
sequences is signicantly larger than genetic diversity
in the gene families of cultured organisms (and their
MGE). A positive answer, indicating a potential greater
evolvability of environmental gene families than cur-
rently known, would thus challenge much of our current
biological inferences, because it would show to which ex-
tent the complexity of genes and genomes evolutionary
history had been underestimated.
Sequence similarity networks oer a promising comple-mentary approach to phylogenetics to analyze metage-
nomic and genomic data and to investigate highly diver-
gent gene forms and relationships of distant homology.
These graphs allow for mathematical analyses of ge-
netic diversity and similarities over dozens of millions of
sequences, providing a powerful framework to address
the evolution of composite genes and genomes. Our
lab is now looking for a PhD student in evolutionary
bio-informatics, who will be funded for three years by
an ERC grant (for a salary of 104 650 euro over 3 years,
amounting to 1935 euro /month before taxes).
The candidate will take advantage of graph properties
and algorithms from the graph theory, inspired from
the study of social, regulatory, and interaction networks,
and apply them on publically available and original en-
vironmental data to address questions such as: - Can we
detect new forms of polymerases/restriction enzymes in
temperate or cold environments ? - Can we detect highly
divergent drug resistance genes in the environment? -
Can we identify divergent environmental homologs of
usually strongly conserved gene families in each/all do-
main(s) of life (such as ribosomal protein coding genes)?
The observation of conserved divergent groups of envi-
ronmental sequences may suggest the existence of still
undetected deep-branching microbial lineages in nature
He/she will also identify environments rich in divergent
gene forms and design original primers to look for mi-
crobes with highly unusual genes through single cell
genomic studies.
The candidate will work within a consortium of friendly
bioinformaticians (Philippe Lopez, Eduardo Corel), evo-
lutionary biologists (Eric Bapteste), and graph theorists
(Michel Habib), and be hosted in the University Pierre
and Marie Curie in the center of Paris, France. Ideally,
the candidate should have a strong interest for evolution-
ary biology, microbial evolution and a good background
in bio-informatics, or graph theory. Interested candi-
dates are invited to apply immediately.
Applicants are requested to send a detailed resume,
a motivation letter, a pdf copy of their master the-
sis, and the names of two scientic referees to :
eric.bapteste[at]snv.jussieu.fr
The rst round of applications will be closed September
the 15th, 2016.

*** PhD position available***
The role of benecial microbes in insect adaptation
Background
It is only in the last few years that we have begun to
uncover the full importance of microbial symbionts for
their hosts, and the diverse nature of their benets: in
insects for example, they range from protection from
natural enemies to assisting in plant feeding and even
resistance to insecticides. More fundamentally these
benecial microbes may represent a novel evolutionary
resource - a ^ agene pool', a reservoir of adaptations that
insects can draw from when they adapt to new environ-
ments. If this interpretation is accurate, it would have
important implications for the sharing of adaptive traits
between species that could allow for rapid evolution to
new environments.
o In this project you would rigorously test this interpre-
tation using aphids and their symbionts as a model.
o You would have access to a large genetic database
and insect collection, as well as in-house live organ-
isms and cutting-edge research facilitates to fuel your
investigation.
o You would gain experience of experimental manipula-
tions, molecular techniques, bioinformatics, and statis-
tics (e.g. comparative phylogenetics).
o You will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and
hypotheses.
The studentship is fully funded and available to inter-
national, EU and UK citizens. It will cover tuition
fees as well as provide an annual tax-free maintenance
allowance for 3 years at Research Councils UK rates
(^A £16,057 in 2015-16).
Skills preferred
In a multidisciplinary project such as this, candidates
are unlikely to have a background in all disciplines in-
volved. The most important qualication is motivation
and that the project appeals to you. We can envis-
age strong candidates coming through various routes
including:
- practical molecular biology
- evolutionary theory- biological statistics
Applicants must have an excellent academic track record,
with a bachelor's degree (UK 1 ^st or high 2.1) in a rele-
vant degree. A MSc in ecology, evolutionary biology or
bioinformatics is also highly desirable.

ProtistBiodiversity
The Katz Lab at Smith College is seeking a PhD stu-
dent to join our marine microbe project starting in
the fall of 2017. The goals of the project include
elucidating patterns of diversity of ciliates and other
protists in near-shore environments and exploring the
ecological processes that underlie this diversity. The
project is collaborative between Laura Katz at Smith
College (http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/-
Biology/lkatz/) and marine ecologist George Mc-
Manus at the University of Connecticut (http://-
microzooplankton.uconn.edu/). Work on the project
combines eld work, high-throughput sequencing, mi-30 EvolDir October 1, 2016
crocosm analyses, and both light and uorescence mi-
croscopy. Hence, applicants should have a desire to
improve skills in microbiology, molecular biology and
bioinformatics.
Research in the Katz lab aims to elucidate principles of
the evolution in eukaryotes through analyses of micro-
bial groups, and to assess how these principles apply (or
fail to apply) to other organisms. Currently we focus
on three interrelated areas: (1) Characterizing evolu-
tionary relationships among eukaryotes; (2) Exploring
the evolution of ciliate genomes; and (3) Describing the
phylogeography of coastal marine ciliates.
Smith College is a member of the Five College Consor-
tium with Amherst, Hampshire, and Mount Holyoke
Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Smith College is an equal opportunity employer en-
couraging excellence through diversity. Hence, Ph.D.
students in my lab join through the Organismic and Evo-
lutionary Biology (OEB; http://www.bio.umass.edu/-

StockholmU SexualSelection
PhD position in Ethology
at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University,
Sweden
Deadline for application: November 1, 2016.
A PhD position focused on sexual selection is available
in John Fitzpatrick's research group in the Department
of Zoology at Stockholm University. The aim of this
project is to generate an integrated understanding of
how sexual selection operates, both before and after
mating. To achieve this aim, the project will focus on
halfbeak shes (Dermogenys pusilla and Nomorham-
phus liemi), small tropical freshwater sh that oer the
rare opportunity to study both sexual weapons (their
elongated beak used in male-male competition) and sex-
ual ornaments (their orange colouration used to display
to females) in the same individual. The project will
evaluate how investment in weapons and ornaments in-
uences male reproductive success, identify responsesin sexual behaviours and traits following experimental
evolution in male sexual weapons, assess trade-os in
male sexual investment, and determine which sexual
behaviours and traits are preferred by females. This
project will generate an integrated understanding of
how sexual selection shapes male tness.
The work will be lab-oriented, taking advantage of the
brand new tropical freshwater sh labs in the Depart-
ment of Zoology, with room for over 6,000 aquaria and
several experimental rooms. The Department of Zool-
ogy is already home to state-of- the-art facilities to as-
sess behaviour and sexually selected traits (e.g. unique
2D and 3D behavioural tracking software, computer-
assisted sperm analysis software (similar to what is used
in human fertility clinics), an aquatic respirometer, high-
speed cameras, spectrophotometers for colour analyses).
Depending on the student's interest the project can be
extended to incorporate phylogenetic, genomic, quanti-
tative genetic and multivariate selection approaches to
develop an integrated view of sexual selection. The suc-
cessful candidate will join a rapidly growing sexual selec-
tion group in the Department and will be provided with
excellent opportunities for personal and professional
development towards a successful academic career.
Qualication requirements
To be qualied for research studies in the program, the
applicant must have completed a Master degree (or
equivalent) or have passed at least 120 hp (2 years)
of biological studies, including an approved indepen-
dent project of at least 30 hp at advanced level within
Ethology, Zoology, Behavioural Ecology, Evolutionary
Biology or a related subject. Applicants who have in
principle acquired the corresponding competence in Swe-
den or in another country are also qualied. Therefore,
overseas applications are encouraged. \We are looking
in particular for candidates with a strong interest in
sexual selection, with excellent analytical ability and
experience with quantitative analyses of behaviour and
other traits of interest. Experience in working with
aquatic animals in the lab is especially meriting."

UAberdeen MicrobialEvolution
Funded PhD studentship in microbial ecology and/or
microbial evolution at the University of Aberdeen (UK).
A 3-year PhD studentship in microbial ecology and/or
microbial evolution, starting in January 2017 at the
earliest, is now open for application at the University
of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The deadline for applica-
tions is November 4th 2016 and there is no restriction
regarding the nationality of the applicants.
The project will be designed with the PhD supervisors
depending on the interest of the applicant, including on
microbial ecology, evolution, physiology and/or bioin-
formatics. The PhD project will target key scientic
questions with a special focus on Thaumarchaeota to
align with the research thematic of the University of
Aberdeen Nitrication Group.
Thaumarchaeota form an abundant and ubiquitous phy-
lum of archaea on Earth. They perform a critical ecosys-
tem function, ammonia oxidation to nitrite, which is
subsequently oxidised to nitrate in the process of ni-
trication. Ammonia oxidisers limit nitrication, and
thereby play a central role in the global N cycle. In
soil, they lead to considerable loss of N fertiliser, nitrate
leaching into groundwaters and production of green-
house gases. Thaumarchaeotal cultivation is in its in-
fancy, especially that of soil Thaumarchaeota, but is
currently being achieved employing a combination of
DNA-SIP soil incubations, innovative cultivation ap-
proaches and single-cell genomics and metagenomics.
These approaches are being applied in the University of
Aberdeen Nitrication Group to study environmental
adaptation of these microbes in soil. In recent years,
our research has demonstrated that pH is a key factor
controlling the composition of the soil Thaumarchaeota
community, which plays an important role in nitrica-
tion in acidic soils. In addition to inuencing extant
thaumarchaeotal niche specialisation, pH has also inu-
enced their diversication and patterns of lineage for-
mation through deep evolutionary time. The existence
of several ecologically coherent dominant phylogenetic
lineages ( 'pH-adapted lineages') has also been demon-
strated and several mechanisms of specialisation for
acidophilic growth have been suggested for the thaumar-
chaeotal strains acquired in the laboratory. Finally, our
research expands to other Thaumarchaeota that do not
perform ammonia oxidation in order to understand theevolution of these physiological metabolisms. The Uni-
versity of Aberdeen Nitrication Group, headed by Prof.
James Prosser (https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/people/-
proles/j.prosser) and Dr Cecile Gubry-Rangin (https:/-
/www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/people/proles/c.rangin), is a
well-established group with world-wide recognised rep-
utation in microbial ecology and a high-impact track
record.
The PhD student will join a dynamic team of researchers
within the Institute of Biological and Environmental Sci-
ences (https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/) and the School
of Biological Sciences (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbs/).
The University of Aberdeen (UoA) was ranked 1st in
the UK by the 'Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Sci-
ence' REF2014 exercise and provides an excellent sci-
entic environment. In addition, the University of Ab-
erdeen provides state-of-the-art technological support
facilities with a unique single-cell genomics platform,
highly-specialised cytometry and genomic platforms, an
exclusive thaumarchaeotal culture collection, molecular

De Bekker Lab in the Biology Department at the Univer-
sity of Central Florida (UCF) is recruiting Master's and
PhD students to start in Fall 2017. We are looking for
self-motivated, inventive and pro-active students who
seek to work within an interdisciplinary environment.
The general interest of the lab is elucidating how fungi
of the genus Ophiocordyceps are able to precisely change
the behavior of their ant hosts. We combine behavioral
ecology and eld studies with molecular microbiology
and genetics, genomics and transcriptomics, and chrono-
biology. Your personal interests could therefore range
from genetic regulation of ant behavior, to fungal genet-
ics and genomics, to chronobiology of infectious diseases.
Recent studies have provided us with invaluable genome
and transcriptome data, tools to infect ants and study
parasitic manipulation of behavior in detail, and the rst
candidate genes, compounds and mechanisms that might
be involved in establishing manipulation. It is expected
that projects will be in line with previous and current
work, but students are also strongly encouraged to de-
velop their own research lines within the scope of the
lab.<>Students are supported by UCF's Department
of Biology with teaching and research assistantships,
tuition waivers, and health insurance. Other opportuni-
ties, in the form of fellowships and summer supplements,
are also available. In addition, students are expected
to apply for external funding to both supplement these
funds, as well as gain valuable grant writing experi-
ence. Moreover, interaction with both scientists and
non-scientists through publications, conference atten-
dance, collaborations, outreach events, online media etc.
are highly encouraged.
UCF, located in Orlando, is an emerging preeminent
research institution and America's Partnership Univer-
sity. Major investments in research are being made
by hiring many new faculty and increasing graduate
program enrollment. UCF is a modern R1 university

SawyEvolutionaryHistory
Early Stage Researcher (PhD student) position in Eco-
logical genomics of rapid radiations in plant-feeding
insects
University of Eastern Finland, Department of Environ-
mental and Biological Sciences (Joensuu campus)
JOB DESCRIPTION
We are looking for a highly motivated person to perform
research on the evolutionary history of young but species-
rich groups of sawies (order Hymenoptera). The focus
will be on ecologically diverse groups containing nu-
merous closely-related species that cannot be separated
using standard morphological and population-genetic
methods. New population-genomic approaches based on
genotyping by next-generation sequencing (NGS) pro-
vide a means for studying the species status of closely-
related lineages feeding on dierent host plants, and to
estimate the level of gene ow across species boundaries.
The work will be performed mainly in the Joensuu
Molecular Ecology Group (www.jmeg.), which is led
by Associate Professor Tommi Nyman, and operates at
the Department of Environmental and Biological Sci-
ences of the University of Eastern Finland (www.uef./-
en/envbio). In addition to Tommi Nyman, the work
will be supervised by Senior Curator Marko Mutanen
(University of Oulu, Finland; www.researchgate.net/-
prole/Marko Mutanen) and Curator Stefan Schmidt
(Zoologische Staatssammlung M??nchen, Germany;
www.zsm.mwn.de/hym/e/stefanschmidt.htm). Part of
the laboratory work will be done during extended visits
to the laboratories of the external co-supervisors. The
project, which is funded by the Academy of Finland, also
includes extensive collaboration with an international
network of experts on sawy taxonomy, biogeography,
and ecology.
REQUIREMENTS
The main duties of the PhD student will be to reneexisting protocols for genotyping sawy specimens us-
ing reduced-representation NGS methods (including
ddRADseq), and to apply the methods for research
on several taxonomically complex but evolutionarily
highly interesting sawy groups. The work will require
very diverse skills, including eld sampling, laboratory
work, use of bioinformatic pipelines, population-genetic
analyses, and writing research papers. Many of these
skills will be learned during the project, but applicants
should have a strong background in population genetics
or related elds.
The PhD student positions may be applied for by per-
sons who according to the Universities Act of Finland
(558/2009, Chapter 5, Section 37) are eligible for stud-
ies leading to a scientic postgraduate degree. Persons
graduating in the near future are also encouraged to
apply. However, they are expected to hold a relevant
MSc degree (or equivalent) by the starting date of the
Early Stage Researcher position.
BENEFITS
The position will rst be lled for 24 months, with a
possibility for prolongation for six months. The contin-
uation of the position will be agreed separately. The
current funding covers the rst 2.5 years of the PhD
project, but the chances of obtaining further funding
should be good if things proceed as planned. The start
date of the position is 1 January 2017 or as agreed.
Positions of early stage researchers shall always be lled
for a xed term (UEF Administrative Regulations, Sec-
tion 30). A probationary period is applied to all new
members of the sta.
The salary of the position is determined in accordance
with the salary system of Finnish universities and is
based on levels 2-4 of the job requirement level chart for
teaching and research sta ( euro 1,985.85 - 2,475.31/
month). In addition to the job requirement component,
the salary includes a personal performance component,
which may be a maximum of 46.3% of the job require-
ment component. In practice, the salary will be circa
euro 2,320 /month at the start of the project.

ChemosensoryEvolution
MSc by Research project on canine olfactory perception
abilities
Position Description: An exciting opportunity has arisen
for a funded MSc by Research studentship in canine
olfaction for a UK/EU student.
We are looking for a qualied and motivated studentto work on a project on canine olfactory perception
abilities. The project will run at the University of Lin-
coln (UK) under supervision of Dr Malgorzata Pilot
and Prof. Daniel Mills. This project will address a
fundamental question in chemosensory system evolu-
tion concerning the trade-o between olfaction (sense
of smell) and vomeronasal sensing (detection of emo-
tionally salient chemosignals), and at the same time
potentially contribute to improving eciency of selec-
tion of dogs for detection work (e.g. explosives, drugs).
Olfactory receptors (OR) and vomeronasal receptors
(V1R) provide systems to detect molecules of odorants
and chemicals that mediate pheromone perception, re-
spectively. There is growing evidence of functional and
evolutionary interactions between these two systems.
The aim of this MSc project is to compare olfactory and
pheromonal perception abilities in dierent groups of
dogs, including breeds currently used for scent detec-
tion and breeds considered poor sniers, free-ranging
dogs and dogs' wild ancestors, grey wolves. This will be
achieved via behavioural experiments to test olfactory
perception performance. The student must be able to
travel abroad to undertake experimental work as part of
the programme. The successful candidate will enrol on
our MSc by Research programme in the School of Life
Sciences, starting as soon as possible and lasting one
year. The student will be responsible for carrying out
behavioural experiments, data analysis, and writing up
their MSc thesis. The student will have the opportunity
to join a multi-cultural and inter-disciplinary research-
oriented environment at the School of Life Sciences,
including Animal Behaviour, Cognition & Welfare, and
Evolution & Ecology research groups. This position
is an excellent opportunity to gain research experience
before enrolling on a PhD programme.
Qualications/Experience: We welcome applications
from candidates with background in Animal Behaviour,
Veterinary Science, Zoology, or related elds. Priority
will be given to applicants who have experience in study-
ing animal behaviour and experience with handling dogs.
Good spoken and written English is an essential require-
ment for this position. Knowledge of other languages
may be considered as an advantage.
Funding: Tuition fees will be met by the University in
the case of UK or EU candidates. Non-EU candidates
will receive a partial fee waiver equivalent to home/EU
student fees ( £4500). In addition, the student will re-
ceive a stipend of £10,000 per year (paid monthly) to
cover their living expenses. The costs of project con-
sumables are fully covered by the funder.
Term of Appointment: Starting date should be Novem-
ber 2016 or as soon as possible after. The project has
to be completed with the thesis submission within one40 EvolDir October 1, 2016
year. The student is expected to be based in Lincoln
but able to travel for periods abroad.
Application Deadline: 21st October 2016. Successful
candidates will be invited for interview by w/c 23th
October and interviews are anticipated to take place on
2nd November.
How to apply: In order to apply please email a short
cover letter (1 A4 page maximum) explaining previous
experience, interest and suitability for the position along
with a CV and the contact details of two referees to
Dr Malgorzata Pilot (mpilot@lincoln.ac.uk). Referees
should be former supervisors/ tutors and should be able

PHD FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITY
\Genetic diversity of multi-drug resistant Teladorsagia
circumcincta" Walsh Fellowship Ref Number 2016110
Background Grazing sheep are naturally exposed to
gastrointestinal nematodes which can result in ill-thrift,
decreased production of meat and wool and in some
severe cases may result in death. Nematode control is
highly dependent on the availability of ecacious an-
thelmintics, however the intensive use of these drugs
has quickly led to the development of anthelmintic re-
sistant nematodes. In temperate regions of the world
resistance has occurred almost exclusively in one species,
Teladorsagia circumcincta. In addition, simultaneous
resistance to multiple drugs has been described for this
species in Ireland, New Zealand and other countries. Re-
cently there have been reports of the rapid development
of resistance to a new anthelmintic class, and this has
always occurred in multi-drug resistant worm popula-tions. This project tests the hypothesis that multi-drug
resistant T. circumcincta are more genetically adaptable
in their responses to stress than susceptible nematodes
i.e. they are more genetically diverse with higher mu-
tation/recombination rates and that selection for drug
resistance leaves a genomic signature. Anthelmintic re-
sistant populations of T. circumcincta from Ireland and
New Zealand will be identied, isolated and subjected to
genome sequencing in order to compare with susceptible
isolates.
Requirements Applicants should have a primary degree
(First Class or Second Class First Division Honours) or
M.Sc. in an appropriate discipline (Biology, Agricul-
tural Science, Zoology, Molecular Biology or a related
subject). The successful candidate should be highly self-
motivated and be prepared for eld work, laboratory
work and bioinformatics/analysis. A full driving licence
is also required.
Award The PhD Fellowship is a joint research project
between AgResearch, the University of Otago and Tea-
gasc, the Irish Food and Agriculture Development Au-
thority. The student will spend periods of time in
both New Zealand and Ireland and will be registered
at the University of Otago, under the supervision of
Prof. Robert Poulin (see http://www.otago.ac.nz/-

PhD position in Ethology
at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University,
Sweden Ref. nr. SU FV-2501-16 Deadline for applica-
tion: October 1, 2016.
The link between intrinsic cognitive ability, learning
behavior and patterns of generalization. The aim of
this project is to disentangle the intrinsic and extrinsic
factors that can explain variation in how individuals
respond to and learn to associate with dierent stim-
uli in their environment. This variation in behavioral
responses leads to variation in how the individuals in-
teract with their environment, and will ultimately have
signicant intra- and interspecic evolutionary conse-
quences (e.g. in signal evolution, mate choice and prey
defenses). We aim for a mainly experimental approach,
studying preferences, learning and discrimination behav-
ior and generalization behavior in subjects that vary in
cognitive ability, experience, and/or rearing conditions.
The main subject species for the project will be the
guppy (Poecilia reticulata). We already have existing
selection lines of large- and small-brained guppies, with
associated dierences in cognitive ability. These lines
provide a unique opportunity to study eects of intrinsic
cognitive ability on learning behavior. The majority of
the project will be undertaken in the brand new tropical
freshwater sh labs in the Department of Zoology with
room for over 6,000 aquaria and several separate experi-
ment rooms. However, depending on the preferences of
the recruited PhD student and the development of the
project, there are possibilities to extend the scope of the
project. For instance, we have substantial experience in
studying learning and cognition in birds (wild-caught
blue and great tits and domestic chickens) and compara-
tive analyses across cartilaginous sh is another possible
route. Generally, the project will mostly be lab-oriented
and involve quite time consuming experimental work.
At the same time, the position will provide excellent
opportunities for personal initiatives and development
towards a successful academic career.
Qualication requirements To be qualied for research
studies in the program, the applicant must have com-
pleted a Master degree (or equivalent) or have passed
at least 120 hp (2 years) of biological studies, including
an approved independent project of at least 30 hp at
advanced level within Ethology, Zoology, BehavioralEcology, Evolutionary Biology or a related subject. Ap-
plicants who have in principle acquired the correspond-
ing competence in Sweden or in another country are
also qualied.
We are looking in particular for candidates with a strong
interest in animal learning and cognition, with excellent
analytical ability and experience from studying behavior
and other traits of interest. Experience in working with
aquatic animals in the lab is also meriting.

EucalyptusDierentiation
PhD Opportunity: The genetics of species dierenti-
ation and hybridisation in Eucalyptus (University of
Tasmania, Hobart)
An exciting opportunity is available for a highly mo-
tivated student to join the Eucalypt Genetics Group
at UTAS (www.eucalyptgenetics.com) in a new project
that uses state-of-the-art genomic technologies to char-
acterise genomic regions important for speciation and
adaptation in Australia's iconic eucalypts. The project
will investigate the importance of hybridisation between
species, especially during range expansion and contrac-
tion. Up to $30,000 in running costs will be funded by a
recently awarded Australian Research Council Discovery
Grant.
A major international eort has recently seen a eucalypt
become the second forest tree genome sequenced. The
PhD project links the expanding international knowl-
edge on the eucalypt genome to the evolutionary dynam-
ics of wild populations in Australia to provide insights
into the nature of species and processes which have
shaped their evolution. These insights can inform their
breeding as well as their conservation and management
in Australia.
The project will be embedded in the Eucalypt Genetics
Group at UTAS (www.eucalyptgenetics.com) (led by
Profs Brad Potts and Ren e Vaillancourt) which has a
world-class interdisciplinary research programme that
investigates the evolutionary and ecological forces that
shape diversity in Eucalyptus. The project is based in
Hobart which oers an excellent lifestyle with stunning
wilderness areas nearby, a vibrant arts and boutique
food culture and aordable living expenses compared
with other Australian capital cities.
To apply, please email a brief summary of research inter-
ests along with a CV and the contact details for at least
two referees. Applications will be assessed on an ongoing
basis. Students with an excellent academic background
and enthusiasm will be invited to apply to UTAS for
a competitive APA Scholarship (open until 16 October
2016). International students will need to apply for a
UTAS International Scholarship, or through another
program (e.g. Endeavour, or a scheme in the applicant's
home country). To rank highly in these scholarshiprounds, students will need to have completed a Mas-
ters by Research (or international equivalent) or rst

UValencia RotiferAdaptation
Adaptation of rotifers to impredictable habitats
PhD fellowship position (ICBiBE, University of Valen-
cia, Spain)
The Evolutionary Ecology laboratory at the Cavanilles
Institute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology
(ICBiBE; (ecoloevol@ICBiBE) investigates on zooplank-
ters in uctuating environments. The Spanish Ministry
of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) has open
a call to grant a fellowship associated to the ongoing
project 'Environmental unpredictability and counteract-
ing eects on sex response in rotifers (CGL2015-65422-
P)', leaded by Mar ~Aa Jose Carmona (carmona@uv.es)
and Manuel Serra (serram@uv.es ).
Bet hedging (i.e. risk-spreading strategies) is one of the
expected adaptive responses when uctuations are un-
predictable. However, by hedging their bets, organisms
incurs in important costs. The project uses a set of
rotifer (Brachionus plicatilis) populations whose habi-
tats embraces a range of environmental unpredictability.
The project aims to test whether populations adapt
locally to the level of environmental unpredictability by
evolving diverging strategies for sexual reproduction. A
negative relationship between sexual reproduction ratio
and environmental unpredictability is hypothesized andOctober 1, 2016 EvolDir 47
will be tested. Additionally, successful sex in facultative
sexuals needs population synchronization, which can be
improved by quorum sensing. We will test hypotheses
on the mechanisms of quorum sensing. As sex synchro-
nization opposes to bet hedging, we will test whether
a negative relationship between quorum sensing and
environmental unpredictability exists. It is known that
some facultative sexual rotifers do not respond to sex in-
duction during a few generations after leaving diapause.
This feature is regarded as adaptive for a clone prolif-
eration. We will investigate if such sex-blocking eect
occurs in B. plicatilis. However, sex-blocking eect may
cause fail to produce diapausing stages if the growing
season ends shortly after leaving diapause, a likely event
if the growing season length varies much and cannot
be predicted. Accordingly, we will test the expectation
that sex-blocking eect decreases with environmental
unpredictability. Additionally, we hypothesize that an
increase in the responsiveness to sex induction after leav-
ing diapause is correlated with the expression of genes
associated to meiosis and meiosis regulation, and we
will investigate this correlation using transcriptomics.
The fellowship covers up to four years. Candidates on
performing a Ph. D. thesis associated to the ongoing
project must have a strong background in population
ecology and evolutionary biology. Skills in statistics,
population genetics, molecular biology and computer
programming are welcome.
Eligible applicants must have been admitted in the Doc-
toral Program in Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Valencia for 2016-17 academic year

ESR5: \EFFICIENT CAPTURING AND THIRD-
GENERATION SEQUENCING OF COMPLEX GE-
NOMIC REGIONS".
PhD position for 36 month
Summary: Sequencing of complex genomic regions can
be achieved by direct sequencing of long single molecules
via third-generation sequencing. Targeted sequencing of
long DNA stretches of interest is challenging. Current
capturing methods are inecient and too expensive to
be used in every-day research. Nevertheless, multiple
biological traits of both fundamental and commercial
interest are determined by complex genomic regions (su-
pergenes), whose functional analysis is hindered because
their genomic sequence remains unknown. We aim to
establish a protocol allowing us to specically capture
very long DNA stretches that could be directly funneled
into commercially available third-generation sequencers
(Pacic Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore). We will
use this methodology to reveal the full sequence of the
S-locus in Primula veris and to study its evolution and
molecular genetics in a wide range of primrose species.
Job Description: The goal of this project is to develop
a new methodology for capturing and sequencing com-
plex genomic regions in a targeted way. Therefore, this
position involves molecular laboratory work to develop
and optimize capturing and sequencing protocols; bioin-
formatics work to analyse and interpret next-generation
sequencing data; and evolutionary and functional ge-
netic analyses of the S-locus (heterostyly supergene)
in primroses. Building on published work by ElenaConti and Michael Lenhard, the project uses state-of-
the-art third generation sequencing technology to gen-
erate long sequencing reads, coupled with custom made
bioinformatics pipelines to assemble and annotate these
sequences. Recent development by Oxford Nanopore
technology in combination with the methodology we will
develop in this project may be used for future in-eld
screening applications. This project is aimed at address-
ing one of the fundamental questions of evolutionary
biology, namely, the genetic makeup of the S-locus in
primroses, via developing a new cutting-edge method
for third-generation sequencing. This PhD position of-
fers a unique opportunity to combine the experience
of working for a market-leading private company that
provides solutions for life sciences (BaseClear VB) with
an academic research environment at the University of
Zurich, oering world leading expertise in evolution-
ary biology research and cutting-edge improvements of
technological advances in genomic sequencing.

Vienna CichlidMating
We are searching for highly motivated students who
would like to join our current project on mating systems
and parental care behavior of two closely related cichlid
species Neolamprologus caudopunctatus and Neolam-
prologus pulcher.
Master theses could address several dierent questions:
- Female preference for male partners that invest more
in nest defense
- Parental care, egg cannibalism and hormones
- Intra- and interspecic competition for breeding sites
- Social assays with both species
We are looking forward to hosting master students with
a keen interest in scientic questions and behavioral
sh biology and are able to work independently as well
as within a team. A Bachelor's degree preferably in
Behavioral Ecology/Ethology or a related discipline is
needed. Experience with sh is benecial but not re-
quired. The project should be started ASAP (ideally
October/November 2016). No funding is available, but
we will provide support and assist the candidate if he
or she wishes to apply for a grant.
Our daily communication is mainly in English.

VirginiaCommonwealthU Genomics
The Eckert laboratory (http://eckertlab.blogspot.com/)
at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Depart-
ment of Biology (http://biology.vcu.edu/), is recruiting
graduate students to start in the Fall semester of 2017.
My preference is for students interested in developing
a doctoral thesis as part of the VCU Integrative Life
Sciences Ph.D. program, but the Department of Biol-
ogy also has a strong M.S. program that is well funded.
Students will have the opportunity to work on a variety
of projects funded by the National Science Foundation
and the United States Department of Agriculture, as
well as be encouraged to develop their own projects
nested within the larger research goals of the labora-
tory. Almost all projects in the laboratory utilize high-
throughput DNA sequencing in combination with com-
putational and statistical tools to test hypotheses about
the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Typically,
we work with populations of trees, including projects
involving multiple species, but have expanded into the
world of invasive insect species. The Department of Biol-
ogy also has a vibrant group of evolutionary researchers
working on molecular evolution, phylogeography, micro-
biome evolution, and the evolutionary consequences of
gene ow.
If you have an interest in graduate school and
a passion for evolutionary biology, please take a
moment to check out my research interests (on
my laboratory webpage), mentoring philosophy
(http://mentoringphilosophyaje.blogspot.com/) and
the graduate programs at VCU (Ph.D.: http:/-
/lifesciences.vcu.edu/academic-programs/phd-in-
integrative-life-sciences/; M.S.: http://biology.vcu.edu/-
graduate-program/ms-program-in-biology/). Deadlines
to apply are January 10th for the Ph.D. program
and January 15th for the M.S. program. Funding in
both programs is in the form of competitive teaching50 EvolDir October 1, 2016
and/or research assistantships. For the Ph.D. program,
students in good standing with coursework and research,
which are evaluated annually, receive support through
stipends and tuition/fee waivers provided in the form
of either graduate research assistantships (GRAs) or
graduate teaching assistantships (GTAs). The M.S.
program works similarly, but funding is only in the
form of GTAs. For students in the Ph.D. program,
funding is guaranteed for ve years. For students
in the M.S. program, funding is guaranteed for two
years. If these programs seem to be a good t to your
plans for graduate school, please do not hesitate to
contact me via e-mail (aeckert2@vcu.edu) or phone
(+1-804-828-0800). If you contact me via e-mail, please
include information about your research interests
and career goals, previous schooling (e.g. unocial
transcripts), GRE scores, and, if possible, a sample of
writing (e.g. a college term paper or publication).
As far as locality, VCU is located in downtown Rich-
mond, Virginia. Richmond is a dynamic city with strong
art and food scenes. The James River runs through
downtown and provides opportunities for hiking, raft-
ing, and kayaking. For example, my daily commute
to work includes a three mile walk or bike ride mostly
through the riparian forests of the James River where
ospreys and bald eagles nest.

EvolutionPlantMicrobes
The Porter lab at Washington State University, Vancou-
ver, is recruiting graduate students for fall 2017. Our
lab explores the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of
plants and their microbial symbionts to test fundamen-tal theory about cooperative interactions. We focus on
environmentally acquired symbioses between plants and
microbial mutualists such as nitrogen-xing rhizobium
bacteria. Our research projects range from the eld, to
the lab to the greenhouse and integrate approaches from
quantitative genetics, ecological genetics and genomics.
Graduate students will have the opportunity to partici-
pate in a collaborative multi-year NSF-funded project
with the Friesen lab at Michigan State University to
investigate evolutionary and ecological shifts in plant-
symbiont mutualism during plant invasions from Eu-
rope into North America. Students are also welcome
to develop a research program aligned with their own
interests and expertise on related topics in plant or mi-
crobial evolutionary ecology. The lab currently supports
diverse projects ranging from examining how plant-soil-
microbial feedbacks impact succession post-eruption
on Mount Saint Helens, to testing the importance of
microbes to plant adaptation to heavy metals, to quan-
tifying natural selection on cheating strategies in mu-
tualism. Visit our research page to read more about
the lab: https://labs.wsu.edu/stephanie-porter/ Grad-
uate students will be supported through a combination
of research assistantship in the Porter lab and TAship
(5 years for PhD, 2 for MS) with the opportunity for
summer funding. The PI will work with students to de-
velop competitive applications for independent graduate
funding. WSUV is a vibrant, rapidly growing insti-
tution located within the greater Portland/Vancouver
metropolitan area, near the Columbia River, Cascade
Mountains and coastal ocean, and as such oers an
exceptional quality of life.
Interested students should send a copy of their CV, de-
scription of research interests, and unocial copy of
transcripts to stephanie.porter@wsu.edu.

environment. The Department has an interdisciplinary
approach to education and research that is deeply rooted
in environmental and evolutionary biology as important
links between the dierent sub-disciplines (cell- and
molecular biology, systems biology, physiology, ethology,
ecology, population genetics, marine biology, aquacul-
ture, biodiversity and environmental toxicology).
The Department of Biology is the host of the Centre62 EvolDir October 1, 2016
for Biodiversity Dynamics (CBD), which is a National
Centre of Excellence funded by the Research Council of
Norway and NTNU.
The Department has at present 23 professors, 11 asso-
ciate professors, 5 adjunct professors, 20 researchers and

Postdocs in Evolutionary Bioinformatics and Molecular
Epidemiology, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.
Postdoc positions are available in the new Evolutionary
Bioinformatics research unit (Head Olivier Gascuel) of
the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France. The huge amount
of molecular data available nowadays can help address-
ing new and essential questions in evolution. However,
reconstructing evolution requires models, algorithms,
and statistical and computational methods of ever in-
creasing complexity. Out unit aims at developing new
approaches that are able to tackle eciently the ever
increasing amount of sequence data, in the eld of evo-
lution and molecular phylogeny. The preferred applica-
tions relate to the evolution of viruses (notably HIV)
and other pathogens, with the aim of correlating their
evolutionary history to epidemiological data. Designing
algorithms able to help in the surveillance of epidemics
is one of our main goals. We recently published papers
on these topics in Systematic Biology, Molecular Biology
and Evolution, PNAS and AIDS. We also investigated
theoretical questions, with publications in Algorithmica,
Journal of Theoretical Biology and Mathematical Bio-
sciences.We are looking for postdocs to tackle large scale prob-
lems, related to ancestral reconstructions, phylogeog-
raphy, dating, selection pressure measurements, and
molecular epidemiology in general. One of the projects
is to conceive a fast, probabilistic version of PhyloType
(Chevenet et al, Bioinformatics 2013), within the H2020
European Project VIROGENESIS, and compare the re-
sults with those of Bayesian approaches. Other subjects
will be discussed with the applicants.
Successful applicants will have high motivations for phy-
logenetics and/or molecular epidemiology, and good pub-
lication records. We'll also consider candidates having a
solid experience in mathematical modeling of dierent
biological data and questions. Strong skills in program-
ming are required, along with a taste for collaborations
and the ability to discuss with a variety of researchers,
ranging from mathematics to experimental biology.
To apply please send to me in a single pdf document:
a CV ( ~2 pages, with publication list), a cover letter
explaining your research interests and your motivations
to join us ( ~1 page), and three references who we'll
contact to obtain advices on your application.

Job description: The Hispaniolan Woodpecker (Melan-
erpes striatus) nests colonially, ranging from 2 to as
many as 20+ simultaneously active nests in the same
tree, making it very unique among woodpeckers (only
one other picid species of the more than 200 is known
to nest in such dense aggregations). Additionally, theHispaniolan Woodpecker is the most sexually size di-
morphic of Melanerpes woodpeckers. Since 2012, I have
been color-banding and observing these woodpeckers
to better understand the social organization of colonies.
Fieldwork in the 2017 eld season will focus on further
studying social organization of colonies, attempting to
answer such questions as:
1) How do nesting substrate (live vs. dead trees) and
its availability inuence colony size and structure?
2) What information do prospecting birds utilize to \de-
cide" where to nest, and how does this information use
inuence variation in colony size?
More generally, we will collect data to help test hypothe-
ses regarding the costs, benets, and consequences of
group living, the operation of sexual selection in coop-
erative societies, and the evolutionary factors driving
the woodpecker's exceptional size dimorphism. An im-
portant objective of our work also includes studying
how parasitic y larvae in the genus Philornis impact
nesting success. A new component in the 2017 season
will involve initiating a next-box experiment. We will

Field research assistants will participate in data col-

include (but are not limited to) nest monitoring, focal
behavioral observations (including nest watches, dom-
inance watches, and foraging records), assisting with
tree-climbing, color-band reading, nest-searching, assist-
ing with bird capture and processing (including metal-
and color-banding), and data management and entry.
All volunteers will have the opportunity to learn various
tree-climbing techniques. Assistants will be trained to
set up, operate, and take down a unique elevated mist-
net system developed specically for this project but
with applications to other ornithological studies.
Days will be long and the work will be physically and
mentally demanding, but for those seeking to gain ex-
perience in eld research, you won't be disappointed.
The workweek will typically be 6 days long in humid,
mosquito-lled elds and forests, involving hiking some-
times muddy, steep hills, climbing barbed-wire fences,
and avoiding bulls; this work will leave you exhausted
at the end of the day! Assistants will be involved in
all aspects of the project, including discussions of the
conceptual framework of the project.

Funding Turtle Conservation
Genomics
Dear colleagues:
Apologies for cross-posting - we are trying to get the
word out as widely as possible.
My colleagues and I recently launched a crowdfund-
ing eort for a turtle conservation genomics study
(available here: https://experiment.com/turtle-climate-change-genes). As next-generation sequencing technolo-
gies become more aordable, we can now begin to answer
challenging ecological questions about the role of adap-
tive genetic variation in shaping species' responses to
environmental change. With that in mind, our goal is
to use next-generation sequencing to quantify adaptive
genetic variation in two species of turtles in Wisconsin
(the Blanding's Turtle and Snapping Turtle).
This work could have real conservation implications for
these two species, and can be accomplished fairly in-
expensively. However, we rst need to raise the funds
necessary to do this work, which can be challenging as
funding sources become more scarce.
We feel that crowdfunding could really bridge this gap,
and we have already raised over 10% of our funding goal
in the past several days. However, we need to raise the
remaining funds in 24 days - otherwise we do not get
any of the funds at all!
If you can, we would appreciate your support for this
work. If you are unable to donate, sharing helps too -
so please consider spreading the word about this eort!

best,

Our next freely-viewable seminar:
Combating phylogenetic artefacts by modeling site-
specic substitution processes with mixture models and
approximations
Andrew Roger Dalhousie University Friday, October 7,
2016, 10:00 AM PDT
The most widely used phylogenetic models of amino
acid substitution involve a single reversible empirical
substitution matrix (e.g. LG, WAG, JTT etc.) and a
mixture model of rate heterogeneity cross sites, such
as a discretized gamma distribution. However, these
models fail to capture important constraints on protein
sequence evolution, heterogeneity in the substitution
process across the tree, and heterogeneity across multi-
ple proteins in a concatenated data matrix. Failure to
model these features of the data can lead to artefacts in
phylogenetic reconstructions, especially for \deep" phy-
logenetic problems. Here I focus on the importance of
modeling site-specic heterogeneity in the substitution
process.
The structural and functional roles of residues in pro-
teins lead to constraints on the kinds of amino acids
that may be substituted at positions over time, a fea-
ture that is not captured by the single-matrix models.
Site-heterogeneous mixture models have been developed
to address this issue. For example, the \CAT" mixture
models (CAT-Poisson or CAT-GTR), implemented in
the Phylobayes program, have been shown to success-
fully avoid long branch attraction problems associated
with single-matrix analyses in a number of published102 EvolDir October 1, 2016
cases. However, the utility of these and other mixture
models is severely limited for very large phylogenomic
analyses because of their computational time cost and
memory usage. I will discuss several simple rapid and
ecient approximations to these full prole mixture
models. Our simulation and empirical data analyses
demonstrate that these approximations ameliorate long
branch attraction artefacts and, in several cases, provide
more accurate estimates of phylogenies than the mixture
models from which they derive.

Python for Biologists
Q&A: Dr. Martin Jones helps us understand the impor-
tance of learning Linux and Python.
Posted on 05 September, 2016 by Carlo Pecoraro
The need for Bioinformatics skills has increased and
become unconditionally fundamental for experimental-
ists to acquire at least basic skills to enquiry, retrieve
and handle the biological information that is regularly
accumulating in various databases.
Most of the time, PhD students and post-doctoral re-
searchers with backgrounds in Biochemistry, Biology,
Genetics, Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering have
met the need for Bioinformatics skills later in their
careers with all the issues related to. So there is an
increasing need to attend Bioinformatics courses with
highly qualied instructors in order to ll the gap and
to gain more independence when doing the analyses.
Here we have the possibility to interview Dr Martin
Jones, who is a bioinformatics expert and founder of
Python for Biologists (http://pythonforbiologists.com/).
Martin started his bioinformatics career with Perl and
Linux during the course of his PhD in evolutionary biol-
ogy, and started teaching other people soon after. Since
then he has taught programming and bioinformatics
skills to hundreds of biologists, from undergraduates
to PIs, and has maintained a philosophy that courses
must be friendly, approachable, and practical. In his
academic career, Martin mixed research and teaching
at the University of Edinburgh, culminating in a two
year stint as Lecturer in Bioinformatics. He now runsprogramming and bioinformatics courses for biological
researchers as a full time freelancer.
Martin is the instructor for our rst courses during the
Autumn season.
Can you briey describe why it is so important to learn
Linux for doing Bioinformatics analysis?
The design of Linux is very well suited to the types of
analyses we do in modern data-driven biological science.
The command line tools are designed to be composable
small programs which work together in a pipeline to
do more complex things which mirrors the way that we
work in bioinformatics. Also, the Linux environment
has tools for automation built in, which allows us to be
very productive when working with large datasets. And
of course, many of the pieces of software we want to
use (particularly those that deal with next-gen sequence
data) only run on Linux, and most of the powerful com-
pute clusters that we want to use have Linux as their
operating system.
Which are the main benets from learning Linux in
depth?
Learning to use Linux in depth as opposed to just learn-
ing which commands to copy and paste in order to run
our analysis program allows us to really take advantage
of its ability to automate analyses and create repeat-
able, scalable pipelines. For example, we can write a
shell script that combines general command line data
processing tools and bioinformatics specic programs to
run a complete next-generation sequence analysis work-
ow. This will then make it easy to repeat the same
analysis on many samples, and also provide an easy way
of reproducing the analysis. Being familiar with the
Linux environment is also hugely helpful when working
remotely on powerful servers and compute clusters.
What is the story behind the \project" Python for biol-
ogists?
As a lecturer at Edinburgh University I'd been running
Python courses as part of the Bioinformatics MSc pro-
gramme, and over time more and more PhD students
and postdocs wanted to take the course as well. To cope
with the demand I started running week long intensive
courses for anybody who wanted to attend. After doing
this for a couple of years I decided to make it a full time

How interested users can improve their analysis learning
Python?October 1, 2016 EvolDir 103
Python can t into our research toolkit in a number
of dierent ways. It's a great tool for data manipula-
tion, and we often use it to automate data cleaning and
housekeeping jobs that would otherwise take up a lot of
time. It also has really powerful libraries for numerical
processing, which means we can develop new methods
for data analysis and have them run on genome scale
datasets. When it comes time to explore large datasets
and make gures for publication we can use the Sci-
entic Python stack of libraries. In general, knowing
any programming language changes the way we look at
computing: if a tool doesn't already exist to carry out
the analysis we want to do, we have the means to build
it ourselves.
What are the main advantages of programming in
Python comparing to other programming languages
(i.e. Perl)?
I don't generally get involved in language wars :-) I
have done a lot of work in Perl and still regard it as a
perfectly ne language for many

Dear Community,
We would like to announce the release of libpll - a new
library that facilitates phylogenetic analyses.
Libpll is a low-level re-design of PLL (see http://-
sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/2/356.short), that
oers unprecedented exibility when implementing new
models, testing hypotheses and/or developing new tools,
methods or pipelines.
Apart from the highly-optimized phylogenetic likelihood
function, libpll oers the following functionality:
- parsing of alignment le formats (FASTA/PHYLIP)
- parsing of tree le formats (binary rooted, unrooted,
n-ary trees) - exibility in dening custom models of dna
evolution - support for heterotachous and mixture mod-
els - support for models with arbitrary number of states
- parsimony functions - support for arbitrary number of
rate heterogeneity categories - functions for weighted
parsimony - methods for ascertainment bias correction -
tree visualization
Libpll is highly optimized and can make use of the
SSE3/AVX/AVX-2 instruction sets.
It is available for download at: https://github.com/-
xouris/libpll under the Aero GPL 3 License.

MARAIS GABRIEL <Gabriel.Marais@univ-lyon1.fr >Software Transformer4 2 0 2
Dear EvolDir members:
We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.0.2
of the software Transformer-4, which includes its own
Java Runtime Environment.
As its preceeding versions, this software boosts the anal-
ysis of genotype matrices of any size in PC, Mac or
Linux. It admits data coding formats compatible with
all the molecular techniques used in the investigation
of biodiversity, either codominant (allozymes, nuclear
microsatellites, SNP coded with two letters per geno-
type), or dominant (chloroplast microsatellites, AFLPs,
RFLPs, ISSR or any other molecular technique that can
be binary-coded).
Most matrices resident in T4's matrix explorer can be
transformed easily, swiftly and simultaneously into the
input formats of one or several of the 38 most commonly
used population genetic software (and for any possi-
ble combination of the populations that each matrix
contains).
T4-2.0.2 also allows the users to quickly publish \genetic
diversity digests" in the Demiurge information system.
Such digests are peer-reviewed and made up by a geo-
referenced T4 genotype matrix plus any ancillary infor-
mation relevant to its interpretation that the authors
see t to include (see an example of a published digest in
http://www.demiurge-project.org/matrix digests/14).
The Demiurge website (http://www.demiurge-
project.org/) and the following paper contain more
detailed explanations of T4's capabilities: Caujap e-
Castells J et al. (2013) Molecular Ecology Resources
13: 484-493.

Transcriptomics
Dear Evoldir community,
Has anyone experience with transcriptomics of sh
spleen? I have two treatments and I can't see any
dierential response although I expect it.
I hypothesize that the sh were not doing well and that
actually the spleen response may suggest a possible infec-
tion ongoing instead of their response to the treatment
stress. But I don't know exactely how to prove/test
this.
I have just begun working on this and I would be glad
to get hints or suggestions related to your experience
with spleen transcriptomics.
Many thansk in advance Chiara

New class: using Twitter to advance your career
Twitter can be a powerful tool for scientists, alt-ac
researchers, and academics generally. When used eec-
tively, Twitter can advance research careers, improve
productivity, and further outreach goals. Unfortunately,
very few researchers receive any training on how to use
Twitter for professional purposes.
That's where SciFund Challenge, an outreach-focused
nonprot, comes in with our new class: Using Twitter
to Advance Your Research Career. Over three weeks,
you'll learn the basics of Twitter, how to avoid social
media pitfalls, and how to use Twitter to advance your
goals. Even better, by the end of the class, you'll have
created a personal Twitter plan to further your research
career or outreach.
The class will be running for three weeks, from Septem-
ber 18-October 8, 2016. The class is intended for aca-
demics that are new to Twitter, but would like to get
started with it. The class is open to academics at any
level, in any discipline. The class will be online, so all
countries are welcome.
The deadline to apply is September 17th, but our classes
usually ll up early. Act soon if you are interested!

The Lab. Of Wildlife Diseases (ICIVET-Litoral, UNL-
CONICET) is recruiting volunteers for the upcoming
eld season (sep. 2016 - march 2017) to work on the
study of a host-parasite system in Argentina.
The genus Philornis comprises approximately 50 species106 EvolDir October 1, 2016
of parasitic ies with neotropical distribution This
group has special interest because their larvae parasitize
nestlings and reduce markedly chick survival. Since
these are generalist parasites and several species of this
genus are threatening endangered birds species (i.e.:
Darwin nches in Galapagos), proposed studies are of
importance for the conservation of neotropical birds.
The questions we want to assess this year are: * Mico-
environmental characteristics of birds' nests species and
its role on the prevalence and intensity of parasitism of
Philornis torquans. * How does parental feeding rates
may help to tolerate P. torquans parasitism? * Cues
used by P. torquans to select its hosts. * Humoral im-
mune response and its relationship with the parasitism
of P. torquans.
Activities mainly involve eld (6-8 hrs day/3 daysper week) and lab work (rest of week days) at Es-
peranza city (Santa Fe, Argentina). Weekends are
mostly free. This schedule is specially designed for
volunteers to travel and know the local culture dur-
ing weekends. For more info on the city and nearby
area please visit http://www.esperanza.tur.ar/sitio or
www.santafeturismo.gov.ar . We expect foreign candi-
dates to spend, at least, one month working with our
group. No previous experience is required. Further-
more, those topics and other that may arise may be
used for volunteers for their own undergrad thesis (we
will be happy to mentor/co-mentor students). If inter-
ested please send your CV and a presentation letter

Florida State University.Eco-evoSpeciesCoexistence
Post-doc, for up to three years: We seek a post-doc to
participate in a US National Science Foundation sup-114 EvolDir October 1, 2016
ported project entitled \The Paradox of Coexistence:
The Evolution of Ontogenetic Interactions". This re-
search is a continuation of an ongoing experimental
study of the interactions between ecology and evolution
in natural streams in the Northern Range Mountains
on the island of Trinidad. Our project is built around
four experimental introductions of guppies into previ-
ously guppy-free tributaries that contained only one
other sh species - the killish Rivulus hartii. Our prior
research has characterized how each of these species
evolves in response to the other and to the way the
ecosystem changes after the guppy introduction. One
discovery is that their interactions include bi-directional
intra-guild predation. Theory predicts that such an
interaction is very unlikely to be stable, yet it proves
to be reliably stable in all four introductions and in all
natural streams where these sh coexist. This appar-
ent anomaly is the basis for an exploration of factors
not included in theory that could lend to this stability,
including the contemporary evolution of both participat-
ing species and how these interactions change with the
age and size of individuals in both species. Our project
is an integration of the development of new theory, new
experiments to be performed in natural and articial
streams in Trinidad and the continued study of the four
introductions in natural streams. The post-doc's home
base will be with Joseph Travis (PI) at Florida State
University but will include extensive periods of time
in Trinidad, where he/she will execute experiments in
natural and articial streams. The successful applicant
must have a completed PhD, publication record and

is to identify dierentially expressed genes and genetic
variability linked to precocious male maturation in At-
lantic salmon by analysing available RNAseq data to
better understand functional aspect of this intriguing
alternative mating tactics. The second objective is to
use RADseq methods in brown trout to estimate popu-
lations divergence and demographic parameter in the
context of a species impacted by human exploitation
and management. The candidate will be involved in
bioinformatics data analyses from raw sequence to more
advanced data analyses including functional annotation,
dierential gene expression statistics, variant detection
and in population genetics data analysis including de-
mographic scenario reconstruction.

the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in
Plon and the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel in
the North of Germany. The position is funded by the
German Research Foundation, DFG, in the framework
of the Priority Program \Rapid Evolutionary Adapta-
tion Potentials and Constraints". The project will be
conducted in close collaboration with Prof. Wolfgang
Stephan, Museum f ur Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany.
Background
In this project we aim to investigate the role of recombi-
nation in rapid adaptation of two closely related fungal
plant pathogens Zymoseptoria tritici and Zymoseptoria
ardabiliae. Comparing patterns of genome evolution in
the two species will allow us to address the impact of
ecological constraints on evolution of pathogens. We
have used a population genomic approach to infer the
genomic recombination landscape in the two species and
show the presence of dynamic recombination hot spots
in coding sequences in both species. In this next step
we aim to identify signatures of positive selection in
the genomes of Z. tritici and Z. ardabiliae using com-
posite likelihood ratio (CLR) statistics and modeling.
A particular goal is to infer the genome-wide distribu-
tion of selective sweeps accounting for demography in
the two species and we will correlate this information
with recombination maps to assess the importance of
recombination to adaptive evolution. The development
and application of appropriate models will be conducted
with Prof. Wolfgang Stephan.

The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) in Troms, Norway
invites applications for a postdoctoral research fellow
position in Southern Ocean molecular ecology, which
includes studies of the molecular ecology of two krill-
predators in the Southern Ocean, Antarctic fur seals
and macaroni penguins. The position is supported by
the Norwegian Antarctic Research Expedition (NARE)
project entitled \Population structure and contempo-
rary gene ow in two sympatrically-breeding Southern
Ocean predators with contrasting demographics".
The work will be conducted in our Research Depart-118 EvolDir October 1, 2016
ment, Section of Biodiversity, in collaboration with the
national Antarctic programs of Australia, Chile, France,
South Africa, the United Kingdom and Germany. The
position of postdoctoral research fellow is a xed-term
position for a period of 2 years with a possible extension,
depending on funding.
Work Content
The aims of the project are three-fold: 1) to provide a
comprehensive description of contemporary, circumpolar
gene ow of two sympatrically-breeding species, used
by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic
Living Marine Resources (CCAMLR), to monitor the
ecological state of the Southern Ocean, 2) to charac-
terise the demographic histories of each species in terms
of bottlenecks, founder eects and expansion events and
3) to characterise patterns of selective pressure in each
species across regional scales using genome scans.
The work will require nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
to be extracted and prepared from blood and other tis-
sue samples taken from each species (already collected),
at each of nine sub-Antarctic island locations. Analyses
to achieve the project aims will then require the appro-
priate application of markers that are either selectively
neutral (e.g. species-specic microsatellites and mtDNA)
or under active selection (ddRAD-TAG sequenced Sin-
gle Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and subsequent analyses
using bioinformatic tools.

Post-doctoral fellowship 1 (Statistical genetics)
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is now a
reference method for the reconstruction of the routes
of invasions. Among other methods the dedicated soft-
ware DIYABC has facilitated the use of ABC for purely
sexual species. Yet, among particularly devastating
pathogens of plants, animal and humans, some species
present frequent sexual reproduction in their native area
and clonal reproduction in invaded areas. This is for
instance the case of the fungal plant pathogen responsi-
ble for the rice blast disease, of several aphid species as
well as Plasmodium species. Such geographic variability
in mating system (and thus in the coalescence process)
cannot yet be easily accounted for in available ABC soft-
ware. We propose to extend the scope of DIYABC to
allow the analysis of the routes of emergence of species
comprising both sexual and asexual populations. To do
so, we look for a young talented post-doctoral fellow
who would be in charge of modifying the code, testing
the robustness of the modied program on simulated
data sets and applying it to already available datasets.
The research will mainly be conducted at PVBMT
(Saint-Pierre, R eunion Island) under the supervision
of Virginie Ravign e and in tight collaboration with Pr.
Pierre Pudlo (University of Marseille, France) who is
much involved in DIYABC programming. The post-
doctoral fellow will be encouraged to visit specialists
of the evolutionary ecology of the fungus M. oryzae
(Pierre Gladieux, Elisabeth Fournier and Didier Thar-
reau) at laboratory BGPI (Montpellier, France) for the
application of the modied method to their dataset.
For informal queries on the role and/or appli-
cation, please contact Virginie Ravign e: Vir-
ginie.Ravigne@cirad.fr
Post-doctoral fellowship 2 (Phylogenomics)
Deciphering the history of propagation of plant
pathogens is one important component of epidemio-
surveillance surveys. To this aim, Bayesian phylogeny-
based methods (e.g., BEAST) have proven particularly
powerful. However, various factors such as signicant
amount of recombination, incomplete temporal signal,
scarce historical record or also large eective population
sizes may aect the accuracy of such inferences. Concur-
rently, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has
emerged as an alternative of phylogeny-based methods
for the inference of species invasion history. In an eort
to compare those two approaches, we seek a young tal-
ented post-doctoral fellow with attested skills in either
(or both) methodologies. The hired person will rst be
in charge of testing the relative robustness of existingmethods depending on dataset features (such as data
type, temporal/spatial depth, completion of sampling,
diversity level, degree of recombination and eective
population size). Besides identifying forces and weak-
nesses of each method, this will be the opportunity to
statistically assess the inuence of the sampling over
the inference. We then propose to produce a pipeline to
apply methods of reconstruction to species with distinct
life history traits and compare the power and robust-
ness of Bayesian phylogeny-based and ABC procedures
on simulated datasets. Finally, the post-doctoral fel-
low will be given the opportunity to apply one or the
two methods to a number of already available datasets
of emerging plant pests (including bacteria, fungi and
viruses).
The research will mainly be conducted at PVBMT
(Saint-Pierre, R eunion Island) under the supervision
of Pierre Lefeuvre and Adrien Rieux and in

ConservationGenomics
Postdoctoral fellow opportunity to perform research on
contemporary evolution in amphibians in response to
rapid changes in selective pressures - Trent University
Infectious diseases play major roles in species adapta-
tion, evolution, and persistence. The selective pressures
imposed by pathogens are predicted to increase dueto habitat modications and climate changes altering
disease dynamics by promoting the invasion of emerg-
ing diseases and disease vectors. With amphibians un-
der threat globally due to a combination of pathogens,
habitat alteration, and changing environmental condi-
tions, it is unclear what capacity amphibians have to
adapt to rapid changes in pathogen-mediated selection
that threaten their persistence. One approach for un-
derstanding adaptation to disease is to examine the
correlation between the geographic distribution of host
immunogenetic variation and of disease variants, with
these correlations interpreted relative to demographic
parameters such as gene ow that also inuence the
distribution of adaptive and non-adaptive genetic varia-
tion. We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow to take both
a metabarcoding approach to identify genetic variation
of key pathogens and an adaptive landscape genomics
approach to investigate contemporary evolution and
demographic constraints on local adaptation among co-
evolved and na ve disease vectors. These questions are
of practical relevance given the pronounced climatic
changes associated with changing infectious disease dy-
namics and northward movements of both pathogens
and invasive species.
This work will take place with a large collaborative
group as part of a NSERC Strategic Grant to inves-
tigate amphibian declines. The successful candidate
will also be encouraged to develop/explore independent
research within the framework of existing funding. This
research will be conducted with a collaborative team
that includes the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources
and Forestry researchers within the Natural Resources
DNA Proling and Forensic Centre (www.nrdpfc.ca).
Applicants would ideally hold a PhD in a relevant eld
such as Landscape or Population Genetics / Genomics
/ Metabarcoding / Bioinformatics, and have experience
processing large data sets from massively parallel se-
quencing platforms. The position will commence as
soon as possible, ideally Jan 2017, but no later than
May 2017. Applications will be accepted until a suitable
candidate has been found.

October 2016
Grade 7: 30,738 - 37,768 p.a.
We are seeking an evolutionary biology postdoctoral
scientist to work on an established experimental popula-
tion of blue tits (http://jarrod.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html).
The post provides an opportunity to join a new NERC-
funded project investigating the quantitative genetics of
family interactions and the selective forces they create.
The post will involve experimental eld manipulations,
development and application of new statistical tech-
niques to long-term data and some theory.
In this post, you will perform large-scale eld exper-
iments in blue tits in order to obtain experimentally
veried measures of selection on parental care. This
will involve managing a team of 3-4 eld workers from
mid-April to the end of June. These experiments will be
complemented by a series of analyses of long term data
(10,000 birds from 1000 partially cross-fostered nests)
exploring the genetic basis of parental care and sibling
competition. There will be opportunities to develop
bespoke statistical methods to analyse the data and to
use theoretical tools to place the results in context. You
can expect to obtain some of the rst estimates/tests
of key evolutionary parameters and to be trained in
cutting-edge statistical/computational methodology.
You will hold a PhD in evolutionary biology and will
have experience in quantitative genetic or mixed model
analysis. You will also have experience with program-
ming, including familiarity with statistical packages such
as R. Some experience with C/C++ would be helpful, as

*POSTDOC position: Sexual selection and sensory ex-
ploitation in jumping spiders*
I am currently seeking a postdoctoral researcher to study
sensory exploitation and the evolution of male courtship
colors in jumping spiders. This NSF-funded project inte-
grates ideas from across three areas of animal behavior
(sensory traps, sexual imprinting, and cross-contextual
learning) to ask how a female's experiences with color-
ful (and sometimes aposematic) prey will inuence her
responses to the same colors in a male's courtship dis-
play. The rst phase of the project will involve extensive
experiments with two target species, while the second
phase of the project will use a comparative approach
to test ideas about why elaborate/colorful ornamenta-
tion has evolved in some jumping spider taxa, but not
others. The position is based in Gainesville, FL with
opportunities for eldwork in Arizona and Kenya. Fur-
ther information about current work in the Taylor lab

tential has not been reached yet. In particular, applying
novel data exploration techniques to visualize mutation
maps should help us improve our understanding of the
ne scale mechanisms governing molecular evolution.
The postdoc candidate will thus develop original infor-
mation visualization methods that will provide relevant
summaries of the mutational process. The proposed
techniques will also detect episodes of evolution that are
not well predicted by our Markov models of evolution.130 EvolDir October 1, 2016
Applications of these new visualization techniques are
manifold. Adaptive evolution and biased gene conver-
sion are associated with peculiar substitution patterns
that mutation maps could potentially help identify. Sim-
ilarly, errors in sequence alignment and/or improper or-
thology relationships are expected to generate atypical
maps. Lastly, preliminary analyses of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis genomes demonstrated how mutation maps
can help recover the series of mutations leading to an-
tibiotic resistance. The successful candidate will further
develop one or several of these research leads.
The ideal candidate for the proposed project will have
a PhD in statistical phylogenetics or population ge-
netics, although pure statisticians and physicists with
strong interest in molecular evolution should also apply.
Good skills in data analysis with modern tools and pro-
gramming languages (R and/or Python and/or Java or
C/C++) are essential.

AvianEvolutionaryGenomics
Post doc position in avian evolutionary genomics A re-
search position funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (ERC-Starting Grant) is available at the research
group of Jochen Wolf at the Division of Evolutionary
Biology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Ger-
many. The position is initially limited to two years with
the possibility of extension for another two years afterevaluation.
{Background{ Recombination is a central biological pro-
cess with important implications for adaptation, speci-
ation and, more generally, genome evolution. Theory
predicts that recombination modulates the ecacy of
selection and will impact the distribution of genetic di-
versity and divergence across the genome. This project
will utilize state of the art sequencing technology to
leverage information from population-scale processes
bearing on linkage disequilibrium and meiosis at the
level of individuals to infer ne-scale (recombination)
genetic maps in several avian species. Our primary fo-
cus lies on the genus Corvus where we have access to
several high-quality genome assemblies. The integration
of recombination information with extensive population
re-sequencing data (1, 2) and transcriptome data (3)
will help elucidate the evolutionary processes acting dur-
ing early and later stages of species diversication. In
addition, comparative genomic analyses extending the
framework beyond the level of the genus have the poten-
tial to disclose the contribution of recombination to the
remarkable syntenic conservation of avian genome. In
that, the project will contribute to our understanding
of how population-level processes may translate into
long-term evolution.
{Qualications{ The successful applicant holds a PhD
degree, has an excellent track record with a thorough
background in population genetics and/or comparative
genomics, and is skilled in analyzing large genome-wide
data sets.
{Research environment{ In our research group we apply
an integrative approach to explore micro-evolutionary
processes and genetic mechanisms underlying species
divergence, adaptation and genome evolution. Using
large-scale genetic approaches, as well as eld based
experiments, we characterize genomic divergence across
populations and (sub-)species and assess its relationship
to phenotypic divergence (4)- sometimes with an ap-
plied angle (5, 6). In addition, we engage in comparative
approaches to study evolution across larger timescales
(7). Empirical systems include natural populations of
birds (swallows (8) and corvids (1-3)), marine mam-
mals (pinnipeds and killer whales) (9, 10) and, recently
added, the European hemiclonal water frog system and
ssion yeast. The group is currently transitioning from
Uppsala University to the University of Munich. In-
formation on our activities can be found at http://-
www.ieg.uu.se/evolutionary-biology/wolf/ (Munich site

Candidates for two postdoctoral research positions are
sought for the Perkins Lab at the University of Notre
Dame. These positions are supported by two new, feder-
ally funded projects on the spatial dynamics of chikun-
gunya and Zika virus transmission and control.
Project 1 has a focus on spatial dynamics of chikungunya
virus transmission and control at geographic scales and
will be conducted in close collaboration with the Insti-
tute for Disease Modeling (http://idmod.org). Project
2 has a focus on spatial dynamics of the invasion of
Zika virus into the city of Iquitos, Peru, as well as

Post-doctoral research position in Computational Evo-
lutionary Biology
University of Zurich, Switzerland University Research
Priority Program \Evolution in Action" 2-year position
available starting January 2017
Deadline for application: Tuesday 1st November 2016
A post-doctoral position is available to work with Prof
Frederic Guillaume, Department of Evolutionary Biol-
ogy and Environmental Studies, and Dr Peter Szoevenyi,
Department of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany,
at the University of Zurich, in collaboration with Dr
Katalin Csillery, ETH Zurich - Adaptation to Changing
Environment (ACE) centre.
The position is funded for two years (100% equivalent)
by the URPP Evolution in Action at UZH (http://-
www.evolution.uzh.ch/en.html). The program brings
together evolutionary and molecular biologists with a
research focus on diversication and adaptation, foster-
ing integrative approaches using genomic tools in model
and non-model species. The program provides excellent
opportunities to mix with the community of evolution-
ary biologists in Zurich through formal and informal
gatherings.
The project will centre on the genetics of polygenicadaptation, divided between a modelling part and data
analysis of genomic data in Sphagnum magellanicum.
-Modelling: you will develop a computational model to
evaluate methods for the detection of signature of selec-
tion at multiple loci. Such methods require information
on LD or functional relationship among loci contributing
to a (quantitative) trait. The genomic computational
model will require the implementation of such elements
(including epistasis). You will implement it in Nemo, our
in-house forward-time individual-based simulation soft-
ware (http://nemo2.sourceforge.net/). Nemo is coded
in C++. This part will be led by Fred Guillaume.
-Data analysis: you will use the tested methods with a
genomic dataset in Sphagnum magellanicum to detect
signals of selection at multiple loci. Genomic data (rese-
quencing and ddRAD) for several populations spanning
a large European latitudinal and three Alpine altitu-
dinal transects are available. This part will be led by
P eter Sz ov enyi.
To successfully apply, you will have: - a PhD in Com-
putational Sciences or Evolutionary Biology, or relevant

Job: Ancient Metagenomics Research Fellow (AMRF)
for Ancient Pathogen DNA and Medium Throughput
Genomics of Modern Salmonella
Salary: up to FA-6 (28,982 - 37,768 pa.)
This ve year fellowship is associated with a 2.2M Well-
come Trust Investigator award to Professor Mark Acht-
man to determine How old are bacterial pathogens, and
what evolutionary steps have they undergone? The re-
search fellow will play a key role in the sequencing and
analysis of modern bacterial genomes and metagenomes
from ancient DNA, with a focus on Salmonella enterica.
Ancient DNA has huge potential to shed light on the evo-
lution of pathogens. We have already demonstrated that
an ancient S. enterica genome can be reconstructed from
a thousand year old human tooth, providing unique in-
sights into evolutionary history of these bacteria. During
the course of the project we will be generating hundreds
of ancient DNA metagenomes from ancient human and
human associated remains and sequencing ten thousand
modern pathogen genomes. This unique data set will
allow us to paint a historical picture of the evolution of
this important vertebrate pathogen.
Generating this data will be the responsibility of the
Ancient Metagenomics rESEARCH Fellow (AMrF). The
AMrF will be responsible for manual extraction of
DNA from 100s of archaeological samples in a dedi-
cated aDNA laboratory, and their sequencing (IlluminaNextSeq). Secondly, the AMrF will be responsible for
supervising a dedicated technical assistant, and running
a medium throughput, robotically assisted pipeline for
isolating bacterial DNA from 10,000 bacterial isolates,
and normalizing their concentrations, prior to exter-
nal sequencing. Finally, the AMRF will be responsible
for processing sequence reads through existing software
pipelines, ensuring that the data are uploaded to existing
databases, and collaborating with experienced bioinfor-
maticians in the population genetic and evolutionary
analyses of these data.
The ideal candidate will have a background in ancient
DNA analyses with an interest in bioinformatics and/or
population genetics. The candidate should have a rst
degree in natural sciences or engineering, and hold a
PhD in a relevant eld. Expertise in the evaluation
of genomic sequences is desired, as evidenced by high
quality publications in this area. The ideal candidate
will also integrate tightly into an existing group of bioin-
formaticians and population geneticists.
If you have not yet been awarded your PhD but are
near submission or have recently submitted your PhD
thesis, any oer of employment made to you will be an
under-appointment to the post of Research Assistant at
Level 5 in the University's grade structure, and with a
salary of 28,143. Once your PhD has been awarded and
we have evidence of this from you, you will be appointed
to the substantive post of Research Fellow at Level 6,
with a salary within the annual salary range of
28,982 - 37,768. The projected start date is as soon
as possible. Enquiries should be sent to Prof. Mark
Achtman (m.achtman@warwick.ac.uk).

Overview:
Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic
tools for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing bio-
diversity of natural communities. Their potential appli-
cations include (but are not limited to) accurate water
quality, soil diversity assessment, trophic analyses of
digestive contents, diagnosis of health status of sh-
eries, early detection of non-indigenous species, studies
of global ecological patterns and biomonitoring of an-
thropogenic impacts. This workshop gives an overview
of metabarcoding procedures with an emphasis on prac-
tical problem-solving and hands-on work using analysis
pipelines on real datasets. After completing the work-
shop, students should be in a position to (1) understand
the potential and capabilities of metabarcoding, (2) run
complete analyses of metabarcoding pipelines and ob-October 1, 2016 EvolDir 143
tain diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable
data from raw next-generation sequence data and (3)
design their own metabarcoding projects, using bespoke
primer sets and custom reference databases. All course
materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared by
the instructing team) will be provided electronically to
participants.
Intended audience:
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research and at researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing com-
munity of metabarcoders worldwide. This workshop
will review mostly techniques and software useful for eu-
karyotic metabarcoding. Another workshop focused on
procedures currently used in microbial metabarcoding
will be available from Physalia-courses.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours
of practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's
discretion.
Assumed background:
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run in a Linux environment. Thus, either a Linux PC
or a virtual box running Linux under Windows or Mac
environment will be needed. MacOSX systems might
be OK, although installation of some additional Python
packages might be needed in that case. The syllabus
has been planned for people which have some previ-
ous experience running simple commands in Linux and
using the R environment (preferently RStudio) for per-
forming basic plots and statistical procedures. You will
need to have a laptop with Python 2.7 installed for
running OBITools, the main metabarcoding software
package we will be using during the course, but no ex-
perience with Python is necessary. If in doubt, take a
look at the detailed session content below or send Owen
S. Wangensteen an email (owenwangensteen@gmail.com

Course programme:
Monday 20th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1. Introduction to metabarcoding procedures.
The metabarcoding pipeline.
In this session students will be introduced to the key con-
cepts of metabarcoding and the dierent next-generation
sequencing platforms currently available for implement-
ing this technology. The kind of results that we may
obtain from metabarcoding projects is explained using
examples from real life. I will outline the dierent steps
of a typical metabarcoding pipeline which will be further
reviewed along the course. I will also explain the format
of the course. In this session, we will check that the com-
puting infrastructure for the rest of the course is in place
and all the needed software is installed. Core concepts
introduced: next-generation sequencer, multiplexing,
NGS library, metabarcoding pipeline, metabarcoding
marker, clustering algorithms, molecular operational
taxonomic unit (MOTU), taxonomic assignment.
Session 2. Metabarcoding markers. Primer design. PCR
and library preparation protocols.
In this session students will learn about the various
molecular markers that can be used for metabarcoding
dierent kinds of samples and the quality of the infor-
mation which can be retrieved from them. They will
know about the most commonly used primer sets for
each target

\Advanced Python for biologists"
http://prstatistics.com/course/advanced-python-for-
biologists-apyb/ This course is being delivered by Dr
Martin Jones, an expert in Python and author of two
text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Python-Biologists-complete-programming-beginners/-
dp/1492346136/] Advanced Python for Biologists
[http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python-Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/] . This course will run
from 6th - 10th February 2017 at Flatford Mill eld
centre, Suolk, England
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a basic knowl-
edge of Python.
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at
the organizer's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
A description of the sessions can be found under pro-
gramme.
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein ac-
cession number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence
is).Curriculum:
Day 1:
Session 1 - Data structures in Python In this session we
will briey recap Python's basic data structures, before
looking at a couple of new data types tuples and sets
and discussing where each should be used. We will then
see how we can combine these basic types to make more
complex data structures for solving specic problems.
We'll nish our discussion by looking at specialized data
types that are found in the Python core library. This
session will also be our rst introduction to benchmark-
ing as we talk about the relative performance of dierent
data types. In the practical session we'll learn how to
parse an input le into a complex data structure which
we can then use to rapidly query the data. Core concepts
introduced: tuples, sets, higher-order data structures,
default dicts, Counters, big-O notation.
Session 2 - Recursion and trees In this session we will
cover two very closely related concepts: trees (i.e. the
various ways that we can store hierarchical data) and
recursive functions (the best way to operate on treelike
data). As recursion is inherently confusing, we'll start
with a gentle introduction using biological examples
before moving on to consider a number of core tree
algorithms concerning parents, children, and common
ancestors. In the practical session we'll look in detail
at one particular way of identifying the last common
ancestor of a group of nodes, which will give us an op-
portunity to explore the role of recursion. Core concepts
introduced: nested lists, storing hierarchical data, re-
cursive functions, relationship between recursion and
iteration.
Day 2:
Session 3 - Classes and objects In this session we will
introduce the core concepts of object-oriented program-
ming, and see how the data types that we use all the time
in Python are actually examples of classes. We'll take a
very simple example and use it to examine how we can
construct our own classes, moving from an imperative
style of programming to an object-oriented style. As we
do so, we'll discuss where and when object-orientation
is a good idea. In the practical we will practise writing
classes to solve simple biological problems and famil-
iarize ourselves with the division of code into library
and client that object-oriented programming demands.
Core concepts introduced: classes, instances, methods
vs. functions, self, constructors, magic methods.
Session 4 - Object-oriented programming Following on
from the previous session, we will go over some advanced
ideas that are common to most object-oriented program-
ming languages. For each idea we'll discuss the basicOctober 1, 2016 EvolDir 147
concept, the scenarios in which it's useful, and the de-
tails of how it works in Python. This overview will also
allow us to consider the challenges involved in designing
object-oriented code. In the practical we will work on
a simulation which will involve multiple classes work-
ing together. Core concepts introduced: inheritance
and class hierarchies, method overriding, superclasses
and subclasses, polymorphism, composition, multiple
inheritance.
Day 3:
Session 5 - Functional programming in Python This ses-
sion will start with a look at a few dierent concepts that
are important in functional programming, culminating
in a discussion of the idea of state and its role in pro-
gram design. We will see how functional programming
is, in many ways, the complement of object-oriented

EMBO Practical Course: http://events.embo.org/17-
phylogenetics Tree building: Advanced concepts and
practice of phylogenetic analysis
24 - 29 April 2017, Faro, Portugal
*About the practical course*
The use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of molecular sequences is a vital
part of biological research. These methods underpin
studies on the evolution and epidemiology of plant and
animal parasites and disease-causing organisms, and
more generally they allow an objective analysis of the
patterns and processes generating biological diversity.
To carry out phylogenetic analysis properly, it is neces-
sary to have a good understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the key methods and approaches. This
EMBO Practical Course has been designed to provide
the theoretical and practical skills needed to carry out
state-of-the-art phylogenetic analyses.
The past few years have seen have an explosion in
new methods of analysis including the application ofBayesian analysis methods in phylogeny reconstruction,
the development of improved non-homogeneous models
that much better represent the dynamics of sequence
evolution, and the development of methods for high-
throughput genome-wide analyses. This EMBO Practi-
cal Course has been designed to cater for these newest
of methods and for understanding how they relate to
the more traditional methods. Our goal is to teach
technical sophistication without losing sight of the need
for a critical attitude to data and analyses.

edit?usp=sharing Background:
The diversity of life is shaped by the action of evolu-
tionary forces such as mutation, recombination, and
natural selection. While each of these forces is well
understood in isolation, it is dicult to predict how
they work in combination to shape the evolution of
populations and communities. The ecological richness
of natural habitats, which typically involve numerous
interacting species, present further obstacles to detailed
investigations of their evolutionary dynamics. Similar
complications are present even in simple laboratory sys-
tems, where initially clonal populations often quickly
diversify. Ecological feedback is thus an essential el-
ement of evolutionary dynamics in both natural and
laboratory settings, while interactions within complex
communities are themselves substrates of evolutionary
change.
Technological advances have made the eld ripe for
exploring new ways to reconstitute eco-evolutionary dy-
namics in laboratory models, and for connecting the
insights gained from the lab to observations of diversity
in natural communities. Most strikingly, inexpensive
genome sequencing now makes it possible to character-
ize evolutionary dynamics and patterns of diversity in
unprecedented detail. This has in turn led to new theo-
retical challenges as we attempt to interpret sequence150 EvolDir October 1, 2016
data in the context of population genetics. The purpose
of this program is to bring together perspectives from
dierent disciplines to forge a new understanding of
eco-evolutionary dynamics in natural and laboratory
communities.
Key questions include:
- How does the interplay between organismic changes
and ecological interactions drive evolution of diversity?
And how does this diversity scale with the physical
and biological complexities of the environment? - How
does eco-evolutionary dynamics lead to stable versus
unstable and chaotic communities? How repeatable are
the dynamics, and predictable the stable patterns, of
community assembly across replicate systems? - How
does genetic exchange (e.g. horizontal transmission and
migration) shape the genomic and ecological structure
of a community? And what are the roles of selection
acting on genes, organisms, and communities? - How
does evolution in sexual organisms (such as *Drosophila*
and *C. elegans*) fueled by standing genetic variation
dier from adaptation based on new mutations in largely
asexual populations of microbes and viruses?
A closely linked Santa Barbara Advanced School of
Quantitative Biology Summer Course will take place
from July 24-August 25, 2017.

Course overview: Python is a dynamic, readable lan-
guage that is a popular platform for all types of bioin-
formatics work, from simple one-o scripts to large,
complex software projects. This workshop is aimed at
complete beginners and assumes no prior programming
experience. It gives an overview of the language with an
emphasis on practical problem-solving, using examples
and exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinfor-
matics work. After completing the workshop, students
should be in a position to (1) apply the skills they have
learned to tackle problems in their own research and (2)
continue their Python education in a self-directed way.
Intended audience:
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. Teaching
format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.
Curriculum: Day 1: Module 1 - Introduction Module 2
- Output and text manipulation
Day 2: Module 3 - File IO and user interfaces Module 4- Flow control 1: loops
Day 3: Module 5 - Flow control 2: conditionals Module

The rst Galaxy Admin Training workshop will be held
November 7-11 in Salt Lake City, Utah (the week be-
fore Supercomputing'16 also meets in Salt Lake). The
workshop oers Basic and Advanced sessions.
Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical
data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large
and small organizations around the world and used in a
broad range of biomedical research domains, and across
the tree of life. Galaxy enables life science researchers to
perform their own data analysis without having to learn
command line interfaces or Linux package management.
Galaxy transparently records all analysis steps and eases
workow reuse and sharing. If your organization is look-
ing for how to empower your researchers, then please
consider attending one or both sessions.
Participants will learn how to install, congure, cus-
tomize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics
include tool conguration, authentication and user man-
agement, using heterogeneous storage and compute ser-
vices, and many other topics that will enable you to
get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing
well, and used by your community.
Registration is now open, but space is limited. Early
registration ends September 19. Participants can regis-
ter for one or both sessions. Please review each session's
prerequisites before registering.
Galaxy Admin Training 2016 is hosted by the Univer-
sity of Utah Center for High Performance Computing
(CHPC), USTAR Center for Genetic Discovery (UCGD),

lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at
the organiser's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
A description of the sessions can be found at the bottom
of this page.
WHO SHOULD ATTEND
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology who want to
learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. If in doubt,
take a look at the detailed session content below or drop
Martin Jones or Bert Overduinan email.
REQUIREMENTS
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein acces-
sion number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence is).
No previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary.
SESSION CONTENT
1. Introduction
In this session I introduce the students to Python and
explain what we expect them to get out of it and how
learning to program can benet their research. I explain
the format of the course and take care of any housekeep-
ing details (like coee breaks and catering arrangements).
I outline the edit-run-x cycle of software development
and talk about how to avoid common text editing er-
rors. In this session, we also check that the computingOctober 1, 2016 EvolDir 157
infrastructure for the rest of the course is in place (e.g.
making sure that everybody has an appropriate version
of Python installed). Core concepts introduced: source
code, text editors, whitespace, syntax and syntax errors,
Python versions
2. Manipulating text
In this session students learn to write very simple pro-
grams that produce output to the terminal, and in doing
so become comfortable with editing and running Python
code. This session also introduces many of the techni-
cal terms that we'll rely on in future sessions. I run
through some examples of tools for working with text
and show how they work in the context of biological
sequence manipulation. We also cover dierent types of
errors and error messages, and learn how to go about
xing them methodically. Core concepts introduced:
terminals, standard output, variables and naming,

4. Course content This course aims at detailed under-
standing and hands-on experience of using state of the
art bioinformatics pipelines for one\s own biological
research questions. An important aspect of the course
is to show how genomic data can be applied to address
and answer research questions in the elds of genet-
ics, ecology, population biology, biodiversity monitoring
and conservation. The students will be trained in the
latest bioinformatic methods to analyze high through-
put sequencing data, which is present in many research
projects. The course will cover basic computing tools
required to run command line applications, processing
high throughput sequencing data of the CO1 gene from
environmental samples to reveal biodiversity and anal-
ysis of sequencing data from whole genome scans for
population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general comput-
ing tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line
environment, bash commands, data formatting using
regular expressions and basic scripting in the unix shell
with a series of examples and exercises. The course
introduces bioinformatics software for analysis of se-
quence data from metagenetics (The high-throughput
sequencing of a molecular marker from an ecosystem or
a community of organisms, used for large-scale analyses158 EvolDir October 1, 2016
of biodiversity), through a series of live demonstrations
(AmpliconNoise, TaxAssign, QIIME). The course also
introduces basic and advanced concepts of population
genomics data analysis such as genome/transcriptome
assembly, annotation (BLAST), alignment/mapping, dif-
ferential Gene expression, functional enrichment tests,
SNP genotyping, PCA, outlier tests.
The course corresponds to 1 week of full time studies
and and is composed of lectures, demonstrations and
computer labs.
5. Outcomes 1. Knowledge and understanding
1a. Demonstrate advanced knowledge of experimen-
tal strategies, applications and tools of DNA barcod-
ing/metabarcoding and population genomics.

UManchester Morphometrics
Nov7-Dec16 Online
Dear colleagues
This is a reminder that the registration for this year's
morphometrics course from the University of Manchester
is open (deadline: 21 October 2016).
This year's course will run via the web in the six weeks
from 7 November to 16 December 2016.Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Denitions
of size and shape * Geometric methods to characterise
shape from a conguration of landmark points (Pro-
crustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation, scat-
ter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal com-
ponent analysis * Measurement error and outliers *
Shape transformations and 'warping' { the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing
between groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) *
Allometry and size correction * Inuence of external
factors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response studies)
* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics
of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives,
QTL analyses. * Phylogeny: examining the history of
evolutionary changes of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This activity
stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of
the broad range of questions that can be addressed with
morphometric methods.

-AIMS and OBJECTIVES
The goal of our 5-days workshop is to bring together
an outstanding group of experts that develop concep-
tual, theoretical and experimental approaches to study
the ecological genomics of coevolutionary interactions.
These instructors will introduce workshop participants
to modern concepts, models and methods that are widely
being used or are currently being developed. The rst
four days of the workshop will consist of lectures and
practical demonstrations given by the instructors, fol-
lowed by hands-on exercises performed by the partici-
pants under guided supervision. The lectures will focus
on current topics and latest developments relevant for
investigating ecogenomics of coevolutionary interactions
(see program: inferring co-demographic histories and
testing for co-adaptation). Participants will focus on
datasets provided by the instructors in the light of new
developments. On the fth day, thematic talk sessions
with presentations from invited speakers and selected
participants will illustrate current research on the eco-
logical genomics of coevolution. In order to enhance
discussions during the ve-day workshop, we will also
ask participants to present a poster of their own work on
the rst day to introduce themselves and their research
topic.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the162 EvolDir October 1, 2016
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
