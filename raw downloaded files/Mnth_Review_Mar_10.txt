Electronic conference announcement: “Evolution and
Biodiversity: The evolutionary basis of biodiversity and
its potential for adaptation to global change” http:/-
/www.nbu.ac.uk/biota/e-conference.htm 1st - 19th
March 2010 The organisers of the Spanish meeting of
the European Platform for Biodiversity Research Strat-
egy (EPBRS) and the BioStrat project coordinators
invite you to participate in the electronic conference
“Evolution and Biodiversity: The evolutionary basis of
biodiversity and its potential for adaptation to global
change”. The results of the e-conference will be pre-
sented and discussed at the EPBRS delegates meeting
in Mallorca, Spain on the 12th - 15th April 2010.
Evolutionary processes are ultimately responsible for
the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. How-
ever, they are rarely considered in management actions
and policies aimed at preserving it and making use of
the resources and services it provides. Forthcoming
policies aimed at reducing the current loss of biodiver-
sity and facing the challenges posed by its interaction
with climate change, food security or health security
would beneﬁt considerably from an explicit incorpora-
tion of current knowledge on evolutionary processes.
From a proactive stand, the identiﬁcation of existing
knowledge gaps and sources of uncertainty that limit
the incorporation of evolutionary knowledge to biodi-
versity and global change policies, and addressing them
through targeted research programs, would enhance the
potential success of such policies.
This carbon dioxide-neutral e-conference will address
three topics, one per week of the conference:
1. The evolutionary basis of biodiversity: strategies to
manage and preserve evolutionary processes, and their
likely impact on biodiversity
2. Evolutionary responses to anthropogenic pressures,
including global change
3. Evolution in complex systems and co-evolutionary
networks: managing complexity in the face of uncer-
tainty
Keynote contributors include Andrew Hendry (McGill
Univ.), Joop Ouborg (Radboud Univ.), Michael
Hochberg (Univ. Montpellier II), John N Thompson
(Univ. California), Rick Shine (Univ. Sydney), PedroJordano (CSIC), etc.

tronic conference by ﬁlling in the subscription

Hilo Hawaii ConservationGenomics
Jul26-28
The American Genetics Association (publisher of the
Journal of Heredity) will hold its annual meeting in
Hilo, Hawaii from 26-28 July, 2010.
AGA meetings focus on a single topic and last for 2.5
days. This year’s topic is Conservation Genomics, and
will include talks by a series of genomicists and conser-
vation biologists, including those who are already shap-
ing this emerging discipline. Our goal is to provide a
focused forum for discussion, brainstorming, and devel-
opment of collaborative eﬀorts that leverage emerging
genomic resources for applications in conservation biol-
ogy.
The full speaker list is being completed. Currently, the
list includes:
* Mark Schwartz * David Haussler * Stephen O’Brien *
Scott Edwards * Brad Shaﬀer * Fred Allendorf * Brian
Bowen
To encourage broad attendance, we have kept registra-
tion low ($150), which includes an opening mixer and
evening luau. We have negotiated very reasonable hotel
accommodation in Hilo as well as dormitory space at
UH. Funds will be available, on a competitive basis, to
help defray costs of student attendance.
More details and registration are available at the meet-
ing website: http://www.theaga.org/2010 Please join
us- Hilo is an amazing setting, and we look forward to
an engaging, enlightening three days.

Maynooth) and Brian Moore (UC Davis); the sympo-
sium was convened by Dan Condon, Phil Donoghue,
Kevin Peterson and Davide Pisani.
The aim of the symposium is to address the challenges
of integrating evolutionary and geological timescales in
attempts to establish an integrated understanding of
the evolutionary history of Earth and Life. Focal issues
include the development of molecular clock methodol-
ogy, the reﬁnement of the geological timescale, and the
development of methods for assessing the correlation
between biological events such as lineage divergence,
the establishment of key innovations, shifts in diversity,
and extrinsic environmental events.
We invite you to submit a contribution for considera-
tion within this symposium. Please pass this e-mail on
to those who you feel might be interested. The deadline
for both abstract submission and early bird registration
is 28th February 2010.

ference on Informatics for Phylogenetics, Evo-
lution, and Biodiversity (iEvoBio), at http://-
www.evolutionsociety.org/SSE2010/Register.html .
iEvoBio aims to bring together biologists working in
evolution, systematics, and biodiversity, with software
developers, and mathematicians, both to develop new
tools, and to increase awareness of existing technolo-
gies (ranging from standards and reusable toolkits to
mega-scale data analysis to rich visualization).
The 2-day meeting will take place June 29-30, 2010,
in Portland, OR, jointly with the Evolution Meetings
as a satellite conference. The event will feature tra-
ditional elements, including a keynote presentation at
the beginning of each day and contributed talks, as
well as more dynamic and interactive elements, includ-
ing a challenge, lightning talk-style sessions, a software
bazaar, and Birds-of-a- Feather gatherings.
Attendees can register jointly for Evolution and iEvo-
Bio at a discount, or only for the iEvoBio conference.

SilwoodPark Populations under
Pressure Jun9-11
Dear colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that the Populations under
Pressure symposium will run again between June 9th-
11th at Imperial College London, Silwood Park, UK.
The symposium is aimed at convening PhD students
and early stage post-docs for interdisciplinary discus-
sions within the broad ﬁeld of applied population bi-
ology and conservation. This year’s themes are Range
Limits and Global Change and Uncertainty in Models.
Participants will gather in a friendly setting where they
will have the opportunity to present their own work and
participate in workshops with an international group
of researchers from diﬀerent backgrounds. The work-
shops will be complemented by plenary presentations
from leading researchers in applied population biology
and a number of transferrable skills sessions, alongside
evening social events.
We ask you to forward this invitation to students and
collegues in your lab and department as well as other
interested parties.

UBath SexualSelection Sep
Dear Friends and colleagues
Conference announcement: New directions in sexual se-
lection research: unifying behavioural and genomic ap-
proaches.
Conference aims: Sexual selection is a central theme for
contemporary evolutionary and behavioural research.
Work in this area is focused either on: (i) whole-
organism behavioural, life history and physiological
studies, or (ii) the use of genomic techniques to under-
stand drivers and mechanisms. These two approaches
reﬂect a paradigm split across the discipline. The aim of
the conference is to develop a ’conceptual framework’
to demonstrate how the two approaches can be used
together, and identify priorities and opportunities for
future research.
Venue and date: the conference will take place at theUniversity of Bath (southwest England) in September
2010.
I would be extremely grateful if you could display the
attached conference poster within your department,
and forward this message to colleagues who you think
might be interested in attending.
Further information can be found on the con-
ference website: http://www.ert-conservation.co.uk/-
Conference home.htm We very much hope you will be
able to join us in September and look forward to wel-
coming you to Bath.
With best wishes

Genomes, development and the evolution of animal
form
In the past 25 years, there have been astounding ad-
vances in our understanding of the genes involved in
developmental processes across the animal kingdom. In
many cases, the functions of these genes are conserved
over vast evolutionary distances and are therefore likely
to reﬂect an ancient function in the ancestor of all com-
plex animals. This ﬁnding has been at the heart of
the ﬁeld of evolutionary developmental biology (“Evo-
Devo”) since its earliest days in the 1980 ˆA’s. More re-
cently however, attention has turned away from studies
of laboratory-derived variation towards the eﬀects ofthe environment on animal development and evolution-
ary adaptation. This has resulted in the creation of a
new ﬁeld of research, working towards a uniﬁcation of
natural selection, ecological genetics, evolutionary biol-
ogy and developmental biology “Eco-Devo”. The PhD
student will be able to develop a research project in this
ﬁeld, incorporating elements of genome biology, evolu-
tionary biology and development.

FucusAdaptation
PhD in Molecular Ecology / Ecological Genomics -
Bodø University College (Norway)
The Faculty of Bioscience and Aquaculture at the Bodø
University College (Norway) seeks applicants for a PhD
position in Molecular Ecology / Ecological genomics.
The position is a three year employment. The candi-
date will be a member of our Marine Ecology Research
group, and the candidates work will be attached to the
NFR project, Ecological & Evolutionary responses to
global warming in the seaweed Fucus serratus.
Bodø University College (BUC) is the main institution
for higher education and research in Nordland County
(Norway). BUC is a medium-sized institution and the
academic proﬁle of BUC is organised into four faculties;
School of Business, School of Professional Studies, Fac-
ulty of Social Sciences, and Faculty of Bioscience andAquaculture. The Faculty of Bioscience and Aquacul-
ture areas of expertise include marine ecology, molec-
ular ecology, molecular biology and genomics, repro-
ductive and developmental biology, nutrition, cell bi-
ology, immunology, pathology. The Faculty has excel-
lent facilities and the molecular laboratory has been
recently upgraded (qPCR, Solid, capillary sequencer
etc). For more information check our website http://-
www.hibo.no/fba english The main goal of the project
is to address how the fucoid Fucus serratus, an im-
portant intertidal ecosystem engineer in the North At-
lantic, responds to global warming through its ability
to: 1) move, 2) be plastic, or 3) evolve. The approach
will integrate spatial modeling (Ecological Niche Mod-
eling), transcriptomics (qPCR) and genomics (genome
scans, AFLPs & microsatellites) to disentangle the eco-
logical (range shift and phenotypic plasticity or modu-
lating gene expression) and evolutionary response (se-
lection for the most adaptive genotypes).
The project will be run in collaboration with the Uni-
versities of Bergen, Groningen (NL) and Gent (BE).
We search for a motivated, systematic and indepen-
dent candidate with an MSc (or equivalent) in molec-
ular ecology, ecological genomics, population genetics
or related disciplines. Applicants with practical experi-
ence in molecular biology and population genetics will
be preferred. Knowledge and experience in algal DNA
and/or GIS is desirable but not required
The candidate also must be accepted into an accredited
Phd program at Bodø University College, or in special
cases, at a partner institution. The ﬁnal plan for the
doctoral work shall be formally accepted no later than
3 months after entry into the position. Termination of
the contract can be considered if the candidate is not
accepted into an accredited PhD program within the
stated deadline, fails to produce mandatory progress
reports, does not display suﬃcient progress, and fails
to perform mandatory duties.
The application must include a cover letter, a com-
plete CV including a listing of educational background
and all scientiﬁc works accomplished, and names and
e-mail addresses of two references. Other activi-
ties relevant for the position should be documented
(e.g., ﬁeld work experience, etc). Applications are
to be submitted electronically ( http://www.hibo.no/-
index.php?ID=3D14308 ) (the position will be on the
website in the coming days).
The salary is regulated through governmental stan-
dards, Lpl 17.515, code 1017, wage level 45 (355.600
NOK, circa 38 500 EUR per annum before taxes).
A legally established deposit to The Norwegian Pub-
lic Service Pension is automatically deducted from theMarch 1, 2010 EvolDir 17
salary. The successful candidate must follow all legisla-
tions, agreements, and directives of the position at any
time.
Based on the institutions goals for our employment poli-
cies, our staﬀ should reﬂect the population in general,
both based on gender and cultural diversity. We there-
fore appeal women and candidates with minority back-
ground to apply for the position.

A Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)PhD studentship is available to investigate distributions
of modern and (where possible) ancient domestic (pigs,
dogs, chickens, etc.) and selected commensal animals
(e.g. geckos) to infer ancient patterns of human seafar-
ing, trade, migration and colonization.
Despite the fact that linguistic and archaeological ev-
idence supports a colonization of Madagascar about
1,500 years ago by Austronesians travelled west from
Island Southeast Asia, comparatively little is known
about the links between Southeast Asia and East
Africa. This project seeks to ﬁll the gaps across the
Indian Ocean by using a phylogeographic approach, a
methodology that uses molecular (DNA sequence) anal-
ysis of modern and (where possible) ancient domestic
and selected commensal animals to infer ancient pat-
terns of human seafaring, trade, migration and colo-
nization. The student will collect samples from mu-
seums, ﬁeld trips, and from other collaborators and
compare the patterns of genetic variability across the
region. By analysing the patterns of each animal, and
by comparing them in a larger framework, the timing
and direction of human colonisation can be inferred and
layered on top of evidence from other disciplines.
This studentship forms a part of much larger series of
projects including SEALINKS hosted at Oxford Uni-
versity and funded by the ERC, Crossing the Green
Sea, a project based at ANU, Australia and funded
by the ARC, and a newly emerging project on the
same theme based in Aberdeen University. All three of
these projects are undertaking multi-disciplinary stud-
ies on the prehistoric emergence of long-distance mar-
itime voyaging across the Indian Ocean, and the stu-
dent will work closely with these collaborators.
The project will be based in the newly launched DNA
labs in the department of archaeology at Durham Uni-
versity (UK) and the student will work alongside other
PhD and Post Docs, including those employed as part
of a recently awarded NERC funded project entitled:
Reconsidering Austronesian Homeland and Dispersal
Models using Genetic and Morphological Signatures of
Domestic Animals (Studentship B).
Applicants are expected to hold a good ﬁrst degree and
an MSc or MA in Bioarchaeology, Anatomy, Biological
Anthropology, Bioengineering, Zoology or other rele-
vant subject, and ideally, to have experience of generic
biological lab techniques such as PCR. Although train-
ing and hands-on supervision will be provided, it is es-
sential that the candidate can operate independently
and take initiative to direct the research. The student
will be primarily supervised by Dr. Greger Larson.
The studentship will cover the full cost of tuition fees for
UK students, and will pay an annual tax-free stipend18 EvolDir March 1, 2010
ofˆA£13,490 for three years. There are additional funds
available for related laboratory consumables and travel

This PhD studentship forms part of a Natural Envi-
ronment Research Council (NERC) funded project en-
titled: Reconsidering Austronesian Homeland and Dis-
persal Models using Genetic and Morphological Sig-
natures of Domestic Animals. The project includes a
Post Doc and a PhD studentship and will be based inthe newly launched DNA labs in the department of ar-
chaeology at Durham University (UK). The PhD and
Post Doc will work within a larger team that includes
the department of anthropology at Durham, Aberdeen
University, and the CNRS in Paris, along with collab-
orators based in many other international colleagues
and universities. The project itself is the most recent
within a broad collaborative and multi-disciplinary re-
search eﬀort at Durham University (funded by the Lev-
erhulme Trust, and NERC), which uses a wide variety
of archaeological, anthropological, and genetic methods
to understand the origins and spread of early farmers
around the world.
The PhD studentship will be focused primarily (though
not exclusively) on the extraction and ampliﬁcation of
DNA from modern and ancient chickens and dogs in
Island Southeast Asia. Animal distributions make an
excellent proxy for human movement and by employ-
ing them here, this project seeks to better understand
when, and along what routes early migrating farmers
travelled to eventually reach the remote Paciﬁc. The
chicken and dog results will be combined with similar
data generated from pig samples, and with morpholog-
ical shape analyses on the bones themselves.
Applicants are expected to hold a good ﬁrst degree and
an MSc or MA in Bioarchaeology, Anatomy, Biological
Anthropology, Bioengineering, Zoology or other rele-
vant subject, and ideally, to have experience of generic
biological lab techniques such as PCR. Although train-
ing and hands-on supervision will be provided, it is es-
sential that the candidate can operate independently
and take initiative to direct the research. The student
will be primarily supervised by Dr. Greger Larson, and
the chosen candidate will work closely with Dr Anna
Linderholm, the projects postdoctoral researcher.

UK students, and will pay an annual tax-free stipend of
13,490 for three years. There are additional funds avail-
able for related laboratory consumables and travel for

EcolInteractionsCoevolution
A NERC funded PhD studentship is available to study
the eﬀects of environmental change on ecological and
evolutionary interactions using a bird-moth-tree sys-
tem at Imperial College London, in the Ecology and
Evolution group at Silwood Park.
Project: Eﬀect of climate change on ecological networks
Supervisor: Professor Ian Owens
Project:
It has been predicted that environmental change will
lead to the collapse of ecological networks because of
its idiosyncratic eﬀects on the phenology of diﬀerent
species. There is, however, little detailed information
on the eﬀect on mis-matches in phenology among in-
teraction species on the ﬁtness of those species, or the
way in which they interact. The project aims to address
this shortfall using a combination of experiments on an
established ﬁeld system based on a bird-moth-tree net-
work and comparative analyses on long-term data on
changes in ecological phenologies.
The speciﬁc aims of this project are likely to include:
(i) Quantifying the eﬀect of mist-matches in phenology
on each species in a network;
(ii) Estimating the extent of local co-adaptation be-
tween the diﬀerent species involved in a network
(iii) Predicting the extent to which phenotypic plastic-
ity and evolutionary change can prevent disruption of
ecological networks.
The project would suit either an ecologist or evolution-
ary biology with good ﬁeld skills and an interest in the
eﬀects of climate change. The student will receive train-
ing in ﬁeld ecology, molecular methods and statistical
analysis.
Applications:
This fully funded studentship is available to home’
(UK) and EU students with the appropriate residence
qualiﬁcations. Applicants should normally have at least
an upper second class (2i) honours degree or its equiv-
alent, and have, or be in the process of obtaining, a
Masters degree in an appropriate discipline.

PhylogeneticsCommunityRotifers
A Ph.D. studentship is available to study phylogenetic
structuring of communities in rotifers, at Imperial Col-
lege London, Silwood Park Campus, in the laboratory
of Diego Fontaneto. The scholarship will cover tuition
fees, and provide a monthly stipend for the duration of
the PhD (3.5 years).
Deadline: February 19th Interview: February 22nd and
23rd
Studentships open to UK citizens and EU citizens who
meet eligibility criteria. Please note applicants for PhD
positions should normally have at least an upper second
class (2i) honours degree or its equivalent (for four-year
programmes), AND have, or be in the process of obtain-
ing, a MRes or MSc degree in an appropriate discipline
for three-year programmes.
Aims of the project:
How can similar species survive together? Which are
the forces driving and allowing species coexistence?
Only recently, phylogenetic investigations of commu-
nity structure have become possible, testing the eﬀect
of potential drivers, like competition between speciesor habitat ﬁltering. The aim of the project is to get
a better understanding of the forces driving species as-
semblages in nature, using an unusual but very suitable
model: rotifers. They are tiny common animals living
in any wet habitat, where they can be very rich and
abundant. Such high diversity will enhance the power
of the tests. The project will involve sampling diﬀerent
communities in diﬀerent habitats in diﬀerent countries,
obtaining a molecular phylogeny directly from the an-
imals sampled in the ﬁeld, and performing analyses of
community structure.

InstZoology London AntEvolution
PhD on the Evolution and Diversiﬁcation of Ants
Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are amongst the
most ecologically successful organisms with over 11,000
known species in 20 subfamilies originating 115-170 mil-
lion years ago. Recent work has advanced our under-
standing of the evolutionary relationships of this group,
giving us a greater appreciation of the evolution of ant
social structures, life histories and threats. Despite this
research, fundamental questions about ant evolution re-
main.
The aim of this NERC CASE PhD studentship is to
use phylogenetic comparative methods to address fun-
damental macroevolutionary and macroecological ques-
tions within this group. The student will collate data
on ant phylogenetic histories to produce the ﬁrst ant
’supertree’, along with data on social structures, life
histories, geographic distributions and threats. These
data will be used to reconstruct diversiﬁcation patterns,
to determine the factors responsible for diversiﬁcation
shifts (e.g. caste diﬀerentiation), and to identify deter-
minants of ant spatial biodiversity with a view to priori-
tizing conservation. The student will therefore receive a
broad training in phylogenetic comparative techniques,
eusocial evolution, ant ecology and conservation.March 1, 2010 EvolDir 21
The PhD studentship is for 3 years starting in October
2010, based jointly at the Institute of Zoology, Zoolog-

PhD position: nematode evolutionary ecology in Kiel
Topic: Natural ecology and evolution of the nematode
C. elegans
The PhD project aims at a characterization of the evo-
lutionary ecology of the nematode Caenorhabditis ele-
gans. This nematode is one of the best studied organ-
isms under laboratory conditions; yet we still lack un-
derstanding of the conditions under which it lives in na-
ture. Such information is essential for full understand-
ing of the biology of this organism, including the exact
function of its generally well characterized genes. The
project is part of the European ESF Eurocores initiative
on Ecological and Evolutionary Functional Genomics
and it involves direct collaboration with research groupsin The Netherlands, Belgium, and France.
This speciﬁc PhD position (payment through the DFG
according to 13 TV-L/2) will be based in the recently
founded Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Ge-
netics at the University of Kiel (Northern Germany),
headed by Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schulenburg. The depart-
ment itself provides an international and interactive at-
mosphere, while Kiel University and connected insti-
tutes (e.g., Max Planck Institute in Ploen) oﬀer a stim-
ulating research environment with a particular focus on
evolutionary biology and also C. elegans genetics. The
city of Kiel is a medium-sized pleasant town located at
the coast of the Baltic Sea. It is the capital of the most
Northern state of Germany, Schleswig-Holstein. It of-
fers many opportunities for leisure activities, including
theatres, an opera, the Schleswig-Holstein classical mu-
sic festival, the heavy metal festival in Wacken, sailing,
surﬁng, cycling, and the famous festivities of the “Kieler
Woche” V one of the largest sailing events in Europe.
Requirements for the position: Master or Diploma

We are working on a research project examining the
evolution of life history traits and ﬂower production
in the Japanese morning glory, Ipomoea nil. I. nil is a
morning glory common in Mexico and adjoining regions
and has spread via anthropogenic dispersal throughout
the world. It is a highly variable species and exhibits
interesting patterns of variation in life history traits.
We are carrying out greenhouse experiments to evalu-
ate variation among these traits and evaluate hypothe-
ses related to why these traits vary. We are inviting
a graduate student to join our lab to participate in
these investigations, working towards a masters degree
in plant evolutionary ecology. Teaching assistantships
in our graduate program are available for support.
Other ongoing research in our lab includes the system-
atics of morning glories and the evolution of regulatory
genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Our
lab includes masters students, but also active groups of
undergraduate research assistants.
Hammond is located (on solid ground) about 50 miles
north of New Orleans and east of Baton Rouge. South-
eastern is primarily an undergraduate institution, but
the Department of Biological Sciences has a strong
group of research-oriented faculty. Our master’s degree
is an excellent stepping stone towards a Ph.D. or also
is a good terminal degree, depending on your career
considerations.

StockholmU FucusSpeciation
PhD position/scholarship in Plant Ecology
Ecological mechanisms behind speciation, adaptation
and distribution patterns in Fucus radicans and its an-
cestral species F. vesiculosus in the Baltic Sea.
at the Department of Botany, Stockholm University,March 1, 2010 EvolDir 23
ref. no. 3/2010
Project description: A recent and very rapid speciation
event inside the Baltic Sea oﬀers an outstanding occa-
sion to study speciation mechanisms, dispersal and es-
tablishment processes in a changing environment. The
new macroalgae, Fucus radicans was formed from popu-
lations of F. vesiculosus inside the Baltic Sea a few thou-
sand years ago. Both species are biotope-forming with
partly overlapping distributions and contribute with
important ecosystem properties for associated species.
In this PhD-project experimental work in the ﬁeld and
in the laboratory will be used to investigate the eco-
logical mechanisms behind speciation, adaptation and
distribution patterns, especially in areas where the two
species co-exist. A key issue to investigate will be pos-
sible reproductive barriers and factors regulating the
reproductive period. One particularly interesting fea-
ture to investigate is the evolution of asexual reproduc-
tion in the northernmost, marginal Baltic populations
of Fucus vesiculosus as well as in some, but not all, pop-
ulations of F. radicans, and how this may aﬀect popu-
lation structure and resistance to environmental stress
and change.
This PhD position is part of a Formas funded project
(PIs: K. Johannesson, Marine Ecology, University of
Gothenburg and L. Kautsky) and an accompanying
PhD position in evolutionary genetics of Baltic fucoids
will be announced at University of Gothenburg. A close
collaboration is expected between the two PhD students
and their supervisors.

UBern 2 SocialEvolution
2 PhD positions in Evolutionary Biology are available
at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University
Bern (Switzerland) under the supervision of Michael
Griesser to study the eﬀect of life-history on family
lifestyle in birds. The positions are fully funded for
4 years (fulltime employment with salary) by the SNF
(Swiss National Science Foundation), starting March
2010.
I seek 2 highly motivated PhD students to work on
the eﬀect of parental investment patterns (life-history)
on the family lifestyle (pair breeding, family living, co-
operative breeding) in a variety of bird species. The
broader aim of the project is to understand the eco-24 EvolDir March 1, 2010
logical and life-history factors that drive family living
and cooperation. Research has so far mainly focused
on investigating cooperative breeding, however, it has
not separated the evolution of families from cooperative
breeding societies, hampering our understanding of the
factors that select for these separate steps.
We will use a combination of observations and exper-
iments in the ﬁeld, along with a more theoretical ap-
proach to test the predictions of the adaptive delayed
dispersal framework (Covas & Griesser 2007). The PhD
students are highly motivated to develop own questions
within this general framework. One of the two positions
will beneﬁt from a strong interest in life-history theory.
The Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Bern oﬀers
a stimulating, international work environment with re-
searchers working in related, relevant topics (cooper-
ative breeding, life-history evolution). The working
language at the Institute is English. The project is
a collaboration with Prof. Manuel Soler, University
Granada, Spain, and will involve each year 4-5 months
of ﬁeld work in southern Spain.
Required qualiﬁcations: 1) MSc (or equivalent) in evo-
lutionary biology, ecology, behavioural ecology or sim-
ilar 2) A strong interest in evolution of sociality and
cooperation 3) Ample ﬁeld experience of behavioural
observations and experimental work 4) Solid bird han-
dling and banding experience (including mist-netting)
5) Highly motivated and sociable personality 6) Project
management skills and ability to work independently 7)
Willing to work in ﬁeld with basic facilities 8) Drivers
licence 9) Fluent spoken and written English 10) Con-
versational Spanish is a plus.
Applications received before 21st February 2010 will be
given full consideration. Job interviews will be held in
the last week of February.
If you wish to apply, send a motivation letter, CV, pub-
lication list, two contacts for references and short sum-
mary of your current research (preferable as a single
PDF) to: michael.griesser@gmail.com

MSc Degree/Postgraduate Diploma in the Biodiversity
and Taxonomy of Plants
Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh/ University of Ed-
inburgh
Programme Philosophy The MSc in Biodiversity and
Taxonomy of Plants was established by the University
of Edinburgh and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
(RBGE) to address the growing worldwide demand for
trained plant taxonomists and whole-plant scientists.
A detailed knowledge of plants and habitats is funda-
mental to their eﬀective conservation. To communicate
such knowledge accurately and eﬀectively, training is
required in plant taxonomy ’ the discipline devoted to
plant diversity and evolution, relationships, and nomen-
clature. The MSc is perfect for those wishing to develop
a career in many areas of plant science: Survey and
conservation work in threatened ecosystems Assessment
of plant resources and genetic diversity Taxonomic re-
search Management of institutes and curation of collec-
tions A stepping stone to PhD research and academic
careers
Edinburgh is a unique place to study plant taxonomy
and diversity. The programme and students beneﬁt
widely from a close partnership between RBGE and the
University of Edinburgh (UoE). RBGE has one of the
world1s best living collections (15,000 species across our
four specialist gardens ’ 5% of world species), an herbar-
ium of three million specimens and one of the UK1s
most comprehensive botanical libraries. The School of
Biological Sciences at UoE is a centre of excellence for
research in Plant Sciences and Evolutionary Biology.
Recognised experts from RBGE, UoE, and from diﬀer-
ent institutions in the UK deliver lectures across the
whole spectrum of plant diversity. Most course work
is based at RBGE, close to major collections of plants,
but students have full access to the extensive learning
facilities of the university.
Aims and Scope The MSc provides biologists, conser-
vationists, horticulturists and ecologists with a wide
knowledge of plant biodiversity, as well as a thorough
understanding of traditional and modern approaches to
pure and applied taxonomy. Apart from learning about
the latest research techniques for classiﬁcation, students
should acquire a broad knowledge of plant structure,
ecology, and identiﬁcation.
Programme Structure This is an intensive twelve-month
programme and involves lectures, practicals, workshops
and essay writing, with examinations at the end of
the ﬁrst and second semesters. The course starts in
September of each year and the application deadline is
normally 31 March. Topics covered include: Functions
and philosophy of taxonomy Evolution and biodiver-sity of the major plant groups, fungi and lichens Plant
geography Ecology of plants and ecosystems Conser-
vation and sustainability Production and use of ﬂoras
and monographs Biodiversity databases Phylogenetic
analysis Population and conservation genetics Tropical
ﬁeld course, plant collecting and ecology Curation of
living collections, herbaria and libraries Plant morphol-
ogy, anatomy and development Molecular systematics
Fieldwork and visits to other institutes are an integral
part of the course. There is a two-week ﬁeld course
to Belize in which students are taught ﬁeld collection
and identiﬁcation of tropical plants ecological survey
techniques. The summer is devoted to four months
of a major scientiﬁc research project of the student1s
choice or a topic proposed by a supervisor. These re-
search projects link in directly with active research pro-
grammes at RBGE.
Entry Requirements Applicants should ideally hold a
university degree, or its equivalent, in a biological, hor-
ticultural, or environmental science, and above all have
a genuine interest in plants. Relevant work experience
is desirable but not required. Evidence of proﬁciency in
English must be provided if this is not an applicant1s
ﬁrst language.
Funding The course is currently supported by eight
Natural Environment Research Council studentships
that are open to EU students only. Other international
funding bodies have supported overseas students in the
past.

Deadline: 28 February 2010 or as soon as a qualiﬁed
candidate is found Available for 3 years from: October
2010 Funding: UoL College of Medicine, Biological
Sciences & Psychology - home and EU students only
Contact: Mark Jobling, email maj4@le.ac.uk We are
interested in patterns of human genetic diversity, and
how these are inﬂuenced by population-level processes
including migration, social organisation, language
and culture, as well as fundamental genome-level
processes of mutation, copy number variation, gene
conversion and recombination. We have focused on
the diversity of the non-recombining region of the
paternally inherited Y chromosome. Comparisons
with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA provide
information about sex-biased population processes,
and we are also studying the haplotype block structure
of the autosomal and X- chromosomal genome, which
provides phylogeographically informative markers. Our
current population studies focus on Western Europe
and the British Isles in particular, including patrilineal
surnames as cultural markers of male coancestry.
We collaborate with colleagues in History, Archaeol-
ogy and English in a multidisciplinary approach to
understanding the human past. A project will be
available in one of these areas. The ideal candidate
will have a B.Sc. or M.Sc. in genetics, or a related
biological subject. An interest in bioinformatics or
computational biology would be an advantage. For

Title: Evolutionary responses to ocean acidiﬁcation in
free-living protists
Supervisors: Dr Mike Brockhurst, Dr Phill Watts, Dr
David Montagnes
It is now widely accepted that anthropogenic climate
change is occurring, and at a faster rate in the world’s
oceans than anywhere else. An important open ques-
tion is to what extent organisms will be able to evolve
in response to climate change.
Some of the gross consequences for survival in an in-
creasingly acidiﬁed ocean have attracted much atten-
tion, with particular focus on survival of calcifying
species for example. However, the eﬀects of acidiﬁca-
tion will extend more widely than the immediate physi-
ological consequences of calciﬁcation. In particular, we
have failed to appreciate the long-term evolutionary re-
sponse to this selective pressure and the concomitant
eﬀect on intraspeciﬁc biodiversity, which can have a
critical impact on persistence and thus ecosystem func-
tion.
To address the issue of pH-shift on evolution, we pro-
pose an experimental approach on a model system: we
will use long-term selection experiments on standing ge-
netic variation to determine the evolutionary response
to acidiﬁcation by the model marine protist Oxyrrhis
marina - a common ﬂagellate that demonstrates high
levels of genetic, morphological and ecophysiological
variation (Lowe et al. 2005, 2010). These experiments
will reveal not simply the immediate impact of ocean
acidiﬁcation (i.e. the focus previous studies) but the
potential consequences of this well accepted climate-
change pressure on the evolution of life in the oceans,
and thus the adaptability of our oceans to inevitable
change.
This multidisciplinary PhD studentship
will run alongside a larger NERC funded
project ( http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/ ˜ pelagic/-

student will beneﬁt from training in: experimental
evolution, molecular-genetic and genomic techniques,March 1, 2010 EvolDir 27

University of New Brunswick Fredericton
MSc graduate project opportunity: population genetics
I am seeking a graduate student to join a collabora-
tive research program (funded by an NSERC Strategic
Grant) on the ecology of the Bay of Fundy mudﬂats.
These mudﬂats are densely inhabited by amphipods
(Corophium volutator), which are the major prey of mi-
grating shorebirds and ﬁsh. The successful candidate
will join a multi- disciplinary collaboration between re-
searchers at UNB, Carleton University, and Mount Al-
lison University. Our aim is to model the environmen-
tal interactions between climate driven processes and
the population dynamics of C. volutator throughout the
mudﬂats in the Bay of Fundy.
The project will use DNA sequence variation to assess
the level of genetic subdivision and patterns of gene
ﬂow among populations of C. volutator. This research
will enhance our ability to model this system by provid-
ing indirect estimates of the scale to which mudﬂats are
demographically independent. By extending the analy-
sis to include populations of C. volutator throughout its
geographic range (east and west Atlantic), this research
will also provide deep insights into the evolutionary his-
tory of this species during the major glacial events of
the Pleistocene.
The research will combine ﬁeldwork with molecular
data generation (mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequenc-
ing). Successful candidates should have a strong back-
ground in ecology and evolution, interests in population
genetics and statistics, and preferably some experience28 EvolDir March 1, 2010
with molecular techniques (but not required).
Applications will be accepted until a suitable candidate
is found. The anticipated start date is May or Septem-

Ph.D. scholarship available to study the Ecology and
Evolution of Plant Sex Deadline: 1 March 2010
A Ph.D. scholarship is available to study the ecology
and evolution of plant reproductive strategies and the
plant-pollinator’s interactions at the University of Stir-
ling, Scotland, in the laboratory of Dr. Mario Vallejo-
Marin. The scholarship will cover tuition fees, and pro-
vide a monthly stipend for the duration of the PhD (3
years).
My lab is broadly interested in the evolutionary and
ecological processes shaping the amazing diversity of
plant reproductive strategies. Speciﬁc areas of re-
search in my lab include the evolution of ﬂower form
and its relationship to pollination success in the family
Solanaceae, the evolutionary consequences of variation
in sexual forms within individuals for plant ﬁtness, andthe potential for rapid evolutionary change in invasive
species. Work in my lab utilizes molecular and phylo-
genetic analyses, as well as extensive ﬁeld work and ex-
perimental studies of plant-pollinator interactions. On-
going research projects include experimental work in
the U.K., Mexico and China, and the successful candi-
date is expected to actively participate in the ﬁeld work
component of our projects. Further details of my lines
of research and potential PhD projects available can
be found at http://www.sbes.stir.ac.uk/people/vallejo-
marin andhttp://www.ﬁndaphd.com/ . However, the
PhD student is expected to actively participate devel-
oping a project proposal that suits our common inter-
ests.
Requirements The candidate should have a good com-
mand of ecological and evolutionary principles, be fa-
miliar with statistical analysis and basic math skills,
like to travel, and be comfortable with working out-
doors. Previous experience in an ecology or evolution
lab at either the undergraduate or Master’s level will be
considered a strong asset. Having an excellent grasp of
statistics, basic programming skills, or experience in a
molecular lab will set you apart from other candidates.
The entry qualiﬁcation for postgraduate studentships
is a ﬁrst class or upper second class honours under-
graduate degree in a relevant biological subject, or an
appropriate Masters degree.

USussex SocialBeesWasps
NERC-funded PhD studentship based in the UK
Understanding sociality: an automatic advantage from
probability theory?
Understanding the evolution of sociality is one of the
central problems in evolutionary biology. Wasps and
bees are ideal study systems because there are extant
social, non-social and facultatively social species. The
studentship would focus on a neglected yet fundamental
potential advantage of sociality that stems from statis-
tical ﬁrst principles. Individuals in most social groups
forage independently. As the sample size (number of
foragers) increases, the expected variation in their total
foraging success should be reduced. This suggests that
larger groups will have an automatic advantage com-
pared with smaller groups or lone individuals. The dif-
ference should be largest when comparing lone individ-
uals with small groups, i.e. those present at the origin
of sociality. More reliable foraging rewards should allow
groups to ’plan ahead’ more successfully than lone in-
dividuals. For example, groups should be able to more
closely match the number of oﬀspring initiated to their
more predictable future food supply. Lone individuals,
in contrast, should face larger ﬂuctuations in expected
foraging rewards. Lone individuals may be forced to
abort oﬀspring if foraging success is unexpectedly low;
or waste excess food if foraging is unexpectedly suc-
cessful. Both eﬀects should reduce their reproductive
eﬃciency compared with groups.
The studentship will initially involve testing these ideas
using a mixture of experimental work on wasps and
bees and stochastic modelling, the mixture determined
partly by the developing interests of the student. It
is straightforward to record successful foraging events
by observing or videoing social insect nests, and to
carry out experimental manipulations. Experiments
are likely to involve ﬁeldwork trips abroad in Spain(Polistes paper wasps) and/or Malaysia (Liostenogaster
hover wasps), as well as in the UK (halictine sweat
bees). Note: the insects studied very rarely sting hu-
mans!!
REQUIREMENTS: a numerate student, with an in-
terest in behavioural/evolutionary ecology, who has or
expects to receive at least a 2:1 degree and is a UK
citizen. If you are a citizen of another European Union
(EU) member state you will not generally be eligible
for a stipend, unless you have spent the previous three
years in the UK undertaking education (undergrad-
uate study or masters) (see http://www.nerc.ac.uk/-
funding/available/postgrad/eligibility.asp for further
eligibility details). The successful applicant will have
a ﬁtness level suitable for work in the ﬁeld. A driv-
ing license would be useful. Because the work involves
recording colour marks on individual animals, it would
not be suitable for someone who is colour-blind.
SUPERVISION: the studentship will be co-supervised
by Professor Jeremy Field and Professor David Wax-
man, both members of the School of Life Sciences,
Sussex University, UK. Prof Field’s research focusses
on the behavioural and evolutionary ecology of social
systems, using wasps and bees as models (see http:/-
/www.sussex.ac.uk/biology/proﬁle115853.html ). Prof
Waxman uses mathematics, statistics and computer
simulations to understand complex phenomena exhib-
ited by populations of living organisms (see http:/-
/www.sussex.ac.uk/biology/proﬁle2846.html ). To-
gether, they will provide complementary expertise to
help the student develop his/her research in an inter-
disciplinary way.
Sussex University is one of the leading research-led uni-
versities in the UK, with an international reputation
for innovation and interdisciplinarity in research. The
School of Life Sciences is a well-equipped and truly in-
ternational research environment, providing excellent
opportunities to interact with leading researchers and
their groups. The School is probably the top UK cen-
tre for research using social insects. Jeremy Field, Tom
Collett and Francis Ratnieks are well-established spe-
cialists with international reputations. There is also a
strong interest in theoretical biology, including David
Waxman, Joel Peck and Larissa Conradt. Related re-
search areas in the School include behaviour, ecology,
evolution, neuroscience, genetics and genomics, and de-
velopmental biology.

Evolutionary biology of mammalian retroviruses
The human genome is littered with the remnants of
ancient retroviral infections, which make up approxi-
mately 5% of our genomes, a substantially larger pro-
portion than is occupied by protein coding genes. This
pattern holds throughout the vertebrates, with verte-
brate genomes constituting a rich ’fossil record’ of an-
cient viral infections. The vast quantities of data madeavailable as a result of genome scale sequencing projects
has greatly facilitated progress in a ﬁeld that is be-
coming known as paleovirology. This project will use
genome scale sequence data to study the evolutionary
biology of retroviruses and address questions such as,
for example, why are certain viruses more prone to
crossing species boundaries causing novel emergent in-
fections. The project will primarily involve the use of
computational and evolutionary analysis of genome se-
quence data, but there is scope for both development
of analytical methods and also the use of laboratory
techniques for obtaining relevant data.
Funding: this research project is one of a number of
projects in the department. It is in competition for
funding with the other projects. Usually the project
which receives the best applicant will be awarded the
funding. The funding is available to citizens of a
number of European countries (including the UK). In
most cases this will include all EU nationals. How-
ever full funding may not be available to all applicants.

Description of the position The research unit on Ge-
netics and Breeding of Fruit and Vegetable of Avignon
maintains, characterises and valorises several large size
collections of cultivated and wild relative accessions of
melon, tomato, pepper and eggplant. The molecular
analysis of the structure of these collections has started
since a few years. Their use for association studies has
allowed the identiﬁcation of candidate genes and poly-
morphisms responsible for the variations of agronomic
traits (potyvirus resistance, sex control in melon) and
traits related to domestication (locule number, fruit size
of tomato) in the frame of several PhDs. With theo-
retical skills in population genetics and molecular ge-
nomics, the scientist will continue these approaches for
the optimisation of core collections for SNP discovery
and association studies. He (she) will have to use the
relevant genotyping tools according to their fast evolu-
tion and valorise the data of genome sequences available
in tomato and soon in melon.
Context The research unit maintains collections of more
than 8500 accessions of melon, tomato, pepper and

through candidate gene approaches) for traits of in-
terest in the station (disease resistances, fruit quality,
adaptation traits). He (she) will thus have to inter-
act with researchers of the other teams, working on
fruit quality and disease resistance. The scientist will
also interact with the genotyping platforms of the Plant

HomininSubsistence
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropol-
ogy in Leipzig, Germany, oﬀers the position of Leader
of a Max Planck Research Group on ˆ aHominin subsis-
tenceˆ a
Over the last several million years, hominins have devel-
oped diverse dietary strategies to survive and expand in
changing environments. From the origin of meat con-
sumption to the intensiﬁcation of resource use by Late
Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers, we have seen that diet,
and the more general term ˆ asubsistence,ˆ a clearly in-
volves the continuous interaction between environment,
biology, and culture. New questions and models have
arisen that address the relationship between this di-
etary evolution and the broader questions of the evolu-
tion of life histories, technological adaptations, and the
social organization of hominins.
We are seeking a Max Planck Research Group Leader
who can design a novel and well structured 5-year re-
search project to explore hominin subsistence strate-
gies. The call for research proposals is intentionally
broad. We seek a group leader with an expertise in one
of the related areas of research but who is encouraged
to take a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the
research question that they propose. This may include,
for example, methods such as zooarchaeology, isotopic
studies, or modelling, as well as related disciplines.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropol-
ogy has ﬁve departments, including the Department
of Human Evolution (Director: Jean-Jacques Hublin),
with which the Max Planck Research Group will beMarch 1, 2010 EvolDir 37
associated. Therefore, although this is an indepen-
dent Research Group we would expect that the pro-
posed project and team would interact with the De-
partment of Human Evolution, and can use the ex-
tensive research facilities available (Further informa-
tion may be obtained at http://www.eva.mpg.de/ and
http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/.)
This is a fulltime research position. The salary will
be at the W2 level on the German university scale,
equivalent to an assistant/associate professor. There
are associated funds for research scientists to work in
the group, speciﬁcally funding for one post-doctoral
scientist (13/14 TV¨ oD) and two PhD students, as well
as two technicians. Start-up funds for equipment are
available, and a substantial yearly budget for operating
costs will be provided. The appointment will be for
a term of 5 years. Further information on the Max

derstanding biological systems. In particular, the CEB
grouping seeks to understand biological function at dif-
ferent levels: molecular and genomic, organismal, pop-
ulation, ecosystem and environmental. A main theme
of our research is the use of an evolutionary perspec-
tive to inform and predict the behaviour of biological
systems. Research underway in CEB includes: com-
parative genomics (for example to identify probable
non- coding RNAs, see the miRBase database, http://-
www.mirbase.org/ ), development of new bioinformat-
ics software (e.g., phylogenetic methods), use of com-
puter simulations to understand the movements of both
living and fossil animals such as dinosaurs, the study of
pathogen evolution (e.g., HIV) and the evolutionary ge-
netics of social interactions and complex traits. We are
also keenly interested in conservation and sustainability

ABI 3100 Supplies44 EvolDir March 1, 2010
Dear EvolDir Folks,
Our department has an ABI 3100 sequencer. This ma-
chine uses a 16 capillary array, the older syringe system,
and POP6 polymer. We are currently in a situation
where most labs send sequences out to core facilities,
but some people still use the machine for small batches
of samples. Therefore, we’re exploring ways to cost ef-
fectively run the machine given the limited throughput
and increases in ABI pricing. I assume that many labs
are in a similar situation, and I was looking for some
input on how people are dealing with common issues:
Polymer -ABI is now only selling POP6 in 7 mL aliquots
(list price: $468). Does anyone order POP6 from a dif-
ferent distributor at a better price?
-POP7 can be bought in bulk, and although it is
thinner it seems that people have used it in a 3100
(see link below). I’m curious to hear about ex-
periences with this, particularly regarding syringe
leakage. http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/-
archive/00036/BTN A04366BM01 -O36600a.pdf
Capillary arrays and regeneration: We currently use
The Gel Company’s array regeneration service ($200),
usually sending arrays out every 6 months or 200 runs.
I’d be interested in hearing about experiences with
number of runs between regenerations, lifetime of ar-
rays, other companies, or doing this yourself.
Any other general helpful tips would be appreciated. I
will compile responses and send back to the list. Thanks
for any information,

ABI 3100 Supplies answers
Dear EvolDir Folks,
I received just a few responses to my questions about
cost-saving tips for sequencing with an ABI 3100 (see
original post at bottom). Here are the main points:
* It is possible to buy generic polymer from MCLab
(www.mclab.com ), who produces their own versions of
POP4-7. * It is possible to get a service contract from
the third party company SeqGen ( www.seqgen.net ). *
Labs seem to commonly use capillaries for 600-700 runs.
* One person suggested that the life an array can be ex-tended to 1000 runs by not cleaning the polymer blocks
unless the array is being changed. The idea is that lim-
iting the array’s exposure to water particles helps it last
longer. * I did not hear from anyone using POP7 with
an ABI 3100.
Thanks for the responses, -Jeﬀ

AFLP MismatchDist PairwiseDiﬀ
Dear evoldir members,
I am looking for a way to calculate the ’mismatch distri-
bution’ (or pairwise diﬀerences) from an AFLP dataset
with>2000 loci and 120 individuals. Usually one can
use Arlequin, but in my case I always get an ’overﬂow
error’, probably because the data-matrix is too big. It
works with up to 20 individuals, but with more indi-March 1, 2010 EvolDir 45
viduals included the calculation aborts.
Does anyone have an idea how I could solve the prob-
lem or is there another software for calculating the mis-
match distribution ?
Any hints are highly welcome,
thanks & greetings,

Alberta VolunteerFieldAssist
SquirrelPops
Field Assistants Required Columbian ground squirrels
Sheep River Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada
We are looking for up to 4 volunteers to assist with
ﬁeldwork beginning April 07, 2010. End date is nego-
tiable, but preference will be given to applicants who
can stay until Aug 15, 2010. The project investigates
the evolutionary ecology of Columbian ground squirrels.
As a member of the study, assistants will be involved
with monitoring the phenology (when animals emerge
from hibernation), reproduction and survival of individ-
uals. Fieldwork will involve live-trapping and handling
of animals, behavioural observation and assistance with
the measurement of physiological (metabolism) traits
on free-ranging animals. This is an excellent oppor-
tunity to gain experience working with a collaborative
research team on a long-term study of a wild mammal.
Opportunities exist for side-projects for interested and
motivated applicants. All ﬁeldwork is carried out in
the spectacular Rocky Mountains of western Alberta,
Canada, home to some of the most majestic wildlife in
North America.
We will be staying at the University of Calgary’s
R.B. Miller research station in Sheep River Provin-
cial Park, Alberta( http://bgs.ucalgary.ca/facilities/-
facilities ). You will interact with other researchers
working with ground squirrels on a diversity of projects
in behavioural and population ecology. Additionally,
the ﬁeld station is home to a number of other re-
searchers working on a variety of projects, ranging from
insects to large mammals.
Food, accommodation and travel costs within western
Canada are provided. Applicants from outside of west-
ern Canada are welcomed. In this case, the equivalentof airfare within western Canada will be provided to
help oﬀset travel costs.
Training will be provided and no experience is neces-
sary, but candidates should have an interest in a num-
ber of the following (the more the better!): ecology,
evolutionary biology, wildlife, ﬁeld biology, and animal
behaviour. Periods of time will be spent camping and,
as such, successful applicants need to enjoy the out-
doors, be up-beat, positive, responsible and work well
as a member of a team.
If you wish to apply for a post then please send a CV
with a cover letter and contact details of three refer-
ences (with e-mail address), by email to Jeﬀ Lane (con-
tact info below), by February 28, 2010.

Applications Automata Theory
Dear Colleagues,
For understanding biological complexity and algebraic
automata theory applied to living and evolving organ-
isms, as well as psychology, philosophy and game the-
ory, you may be interested the new, long- awaited edi-
tion of the previously unpublished underground classic
by John Rhodes.

APPLICATIONS OF AUTOMATA THEORY AND
ALGEBRA Via the Mathematical Theory of Complex-
ity to Biology, Physics, Psychology, Philosophy, and
Games by John Rhodes (University of California at
Berkeley, USA) , edited by Chrystopher L Nehaniv
(University of Hertfordshire, UK) , & foreword by-
Morris W Hirsch (University of California at Berkeley,
USA)46 EvolDir March 1, 2010
Publisher: World Scientiﬁc Publishing (3 Nov 2009)
This book was originally written in 1969 by Berkeley
mathematician John Rhodes. It is the founding work
in what is now called algebraic engineering, an emerg-
ing ﬁeld created by using the unifying scheme of ﬁ-
nite state machine models and their complexity to tie
together many ﬁelds: ﬁnite group theory, semigroup
theory, automata and sequential machine theory, ﬁnite
phase space physics, metabolic and evolutionary biol-
ogy, epistemology, mathematical theory of psychoanal-
ysis, philosophy, and game theory. The author thus
introduced a completely original algebraic approach to
complexity and the understanding of ﬁnite systems.
The unpublished manuscript, often referred to as “The
Wild Book”, became an underground classic, continu-
ally requested in manuscript form, and read by many
leading researchers in mathematics, complex systems,
artiﬁcial intelligence, and systems biology. Yet it has
never been available in print until now.
This ﬁrst published edition has been edited and up-
dated by Chrystopher Nehaniv for the 21st century.
Its novel and rigorous development of the mathemat-
ical theory of complexity via algebraic automata the-
ory reveals deep and unexpected connections between
algebra (semigroups) and areas of science and engineer-
ing. Co-founded by John Rhodes and Kenneth Krohn
in 1962, algebraic automata theory has grown into a
vibrant area of research, including the complexity of
automata, and semigroups and machines from an al-
gebraic viewpoint, and which also touches on inﬁnite
groups, and other areas of algebra. This book sets the
stage for the application of algebraic automata theory
to areas outside mathematics.
The material and references have been brought up to
date by the editor as much as possible, yet the book
retains its distinct character and the bold yet rigorous
style of the author. Included are treatments of topics
such as models of time as algebra via semigroup the-
ory; evolution-complexity relations applicable to both
ontogeny and evolution; an approach to classiﬁcation
of biological reactions and pathways; the relationships
among coordinate systems, symmetry, and conservation
principles in physics; discussion of “punctuated equi-
librium” (prior to Stephen Jay Gould); games; and ap-
plications to psychology, psychoanalysis, epistemology,
and the purpose of life.
The approach and contents will be of interest to a vari-
ety of researchers and students in algebra as well as to
the diverse, growing areas of applications of algebra in
science and engineering. Moreover, many parts of the
book will be intelligible to non-mathematicians, includ-
ing students and experts from diverse backgrounds.Contents: Introduction What is Finite Group The-

Bower award understanding
genomes
Dear evoldir members–
Each year, the Franklin Institute bestows the Bower
award (250,000 USD cash) to an outstanding scientist
in a chosen ﬁeld. In 2011, it will be given on the ba-
sis of achievement in “understanding genomes”. I can
think of some evolutionary biologists who have had a
rather large impact on how we understand genomes, so
I thought I would share the information for this reason
(I don’t have any personal aﬃliation with this award).
The announcement says:
“The Franklin Institute seeks nominations for the 2011
Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science ofindividuals who have made signiﬁcant scientiﬁc con-
tributions to our understanding of the structure and
function of genomes. Nominations may recognize ef-
forts including, but not limited to: functional genomics,
comparative genomics, studies of complex diseases, and
personalized medicine. Nominations should clearly in-
dicate the scientiﬁc impact of the nominee’s work,
whether innovative, technical, conceptual, and/or in-
tegrative.”

tions are due by May 31, 2010):

Covaris setting advice
Hi,
I use Covaris to shear DNA for library preparation and
am trying to obtain a set of optimal parameters to shear
1-2 ug of ~60 kb DNA to 300-600 bp fragments. I tried
the settings recommended by Covaris for 300 bp (10%
dc, 4 i, 200 bpc, 120 s) but got too much of the frag-
ments falling below 250 bp, whereas lowering the set-
tings (5% dc, 3-5 i, 200 bpc, 90-120 s) result in two dis-
tinct clusters, one around 2-300 bp and one around 5-
600 bp. Has anyone got some recommendations please?

DGGE MHC genotyping
Dear colleagues,
We are conducting population genetic studies in house48 EvolDir March 1, 2010
sparrows, and we are genotyping MHC of individuals
using DGGE. Among other techniques, we used a CBS
Scientiﬁc system (DGGE 2401). However, we some-
times get puzzling gels with this system : migration
lanes are not parallel but look like a “drop cloth”, with
central lanes ﬂeing from the bottom central part of the
gel. Did anyone already experience this problem (and
found solution)? Any help from people experienced
with CBS system would be welcome.
Thanks a lot in advance.

Gel-puriﬁcation methods answers
Dear All,
A couple weeks ago, I asked the list for suggestions and
opinions on methods for the puriﬁcation of DNA from
agarose gels. Thanks for all the great responses! Sev-
eral people asked if I could summarize the results and
send it to the list, so here it is.
I decided to go with the Omega Ultra-Sep Gel Ex-
traction Kit because it is very cost eﬃcient (500 preps
for~USD $200). Tania King (who recommended this
method, said “it’s very cheap and the yield is very good
- better than any other gel kit I’ve used.” http://-
www.omegabiotek.com Other options include:
1. Roche High Pure PCR Puriﬁcation kit - used
for gel and direct PCR puriﬁcation http://www.roche-
applied-science.com 2. Bio Rad Freeze ’N Squeeze
DNA Gel Extraction http://www.bio-rad.com 3. Mil-
lipore Montage Puriﬁcation Kit - quick, only takes
10 mins and no need to melt the gel http://-

- multiple people reported having issues with the qual-
ity of the extracted products http://www.qiagen.com
8. “Pepsi’s” (published by Travis Glenn, though I
couldn’t ﬁnd the ref) - involves putting aquarium wool
in 1mL pipette tips and adding the gel slice to the wool;
spin inside a 1.5mL tube. Recovery varies, but very
cheap (suggested by Joe Stanton)

GeneMapperSoftware Windows7
Hello all,
I’m going to install the ABI PRISM GeneMapper Soft-
ware v3.5 from Applied Biosystems in a laptop com-
puter with Windows 7 Professional.
The software needs to run in an english Microsoft Win-
dows 2000 Professional, so I’ve thought about making
a virtual machine with this operative system or making
a partition to run it.
I’ve asked several people about it because the software
is quite demanding with the laptop requirements and
can generate many troubles, but nobody has tried to in-
stall it yet in a laptop with Windows 7, with or without
any arrangement.
Has any of you tryed it? Any suggestion for making it
work? Do you know any trick about how to manage it?
My e-mail adress is ines.sanchezdonoso@ub.edu
I’ll summarize and send the answers to evoldir.
Thank you very much in advance.

How to Install and use Bioedit
legally
Hello,
Many of us use BioEdit for sequence view-
ing/alignment/editing as evidenced by the most
recent summary of alignment programs (Jan 9, 2009).
BioEdit is a Windows program, however I have
recently begun using BioEdit on my mac without
using windows. There are easy to follow instructions
for installing WINE on your machine which allows
you to run windows programs without also installing
or running a windows distribution (much faster and
FREE!).
See this website for the details on installing Wine:

Human Evolution Textbook
Can anyone recommend a good Human Evolution text
book or popular science book(s) to be used for an un-
dergraduate, non-majors course in Human Evolution?
“Human Evolution” by Roger Lewin has been used in
the past, but we are looking for something that ad-
dresses a broader audience of non-majors.
Response can be directed to sarahhuber@rmc.edu
Thank you.

FIELD RESEARCH ASSISTANT(S) (1-2) needed
from mid March to early August 2010 (dates ﬂexible)
for a PhD project on the breeding ecology and be-
haviour of the long-tailed ﬁnch in Australia. Fieldwork
will take place in the main study area, located in the
East Kimberley (Northern tip of Western Australia)
near Wyndham. Work for the project will consist of
checking nestboxes, behavioural observations and mist-
netting. Fieldwork will require getting up before dawn,
and applicants need to be ﬁt. Ideally, applicants should
have previous bird and ﬁeld experience, good observa-
tional skills, and enthusiasm for bird watching. Previ-
ous experience with bird ringing is also highly desirable.
Study sites are located near a small town, where a ﬁeld
station with basic facilities is located. Successful ap-
plicants must be reliable, able to work independently,
be tolerant of heat and able to hike for up to 7-8 hrs
per day (6 or 7 days/week). The position is a volun-
teer position, however food and housing expenses will
be covered when at the research site. Interested ap-
plicants should email a cover letter, resume, dates of
availability, and the contact information of 2-3 refer-
ences to ERICA VAN ROOIJ (email: erica AT galli-
form.bhs.mq.edu.au). Applications should be submit-
ted as soon as possible, and will be reviewed until po-
sition is ﬁlled.

Field assistants for rhesus monkey research on Cayo52 EvolDir March 1, 2010
Santiago, Puerto Rico.
Hiring Organization:
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology,
Leipzig (Germany)
We are looking for a volunteer to assist on a project
examining kin recognition on a semi free-ranging rhe-
sus macaque population on Cayo Santiago, Puerto
Rico. The project is being undertaken in the Lab
of Dr Anja Widdig, Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Anthropology, Leipzig (Germany) (see http:/-
/www.eva.mpg.de/pks/index.html ). The volunteers
will work alongside Dr. Dana Pfeﬀerle ( http://-
www.eva.mpg.de/pks/ﬁles/people.html ).
The successful applicant will be expected to work on
Cayo Santiago for 5-6 days a week, and may also be
required to undertake data entry and/ or processing
in the later afternoon and early evenings. On Cayo
Santiago, the primary task will be to assist carrying
out playback experiments as well as to help record-
ing rhesus macaque vocalizations. In order to do so,
appropriate training (including the analyses procedure
ultimately taking place) will be provided, after which a
good quantum of independence is expected. This posi-
tion is ideal for graduate students or recent graduates
looking to gain experience in ﬁeldwork and data collec-
tion.
Carrying out playback experiments is a protracted and
patience challenging task, including many hours of
waiting for the correct situation. Thus you must be able
to maintain a positive attitude. In general, applicants
must be in good physical and mental condition; feel
comfortable being far away from family and friends; be
emotionally mature, energetic, and very patient; have
an excellent eye for detail; don’t be afraid of approach-
ing monkeys (!); willing to work in a small team setting
and follow instructions. The ability to work in tropical
conditions and the willingness to adapt to a foreign cul-
ture is needed. Although the work can be demanding,
being close to habituated primates is very rewarding
and a great experience.
The language in our team is English. The successful
candidate must have medical insurance, a valid IACUC
certiﬁcate ( www.citiprogram.org ) and a TB-test from
within the last six months.
There is NO ﬁnancial support available for airfare,
health insurance, housing and food.
Shared accommodation can often be found very cheaply
in Punta Santiago (e.g. $250 per month).
Term of Appointment: 13th March until 13th June 2010
Application Deadline: Open till position is ﬁlledComments: To apply, candidates should email a brief
cover letter outlining their interests, experience, and
why they wish to join the project. They should at-
tach a CV and make sure that two reference letters are
sent directly to Dr. Dana Pfeﬀerle (E-mail preferred).
Please only send email applications.

*** ﬁeld assistant radio tracking *** Netherlands Insti-
tute of Ecology (NIOO) - Heteren - The Netherlands
Because I just heard that my current student is ill (and
will be for the next months), I would like to make this
very late call for a ﬁeld asssistant position to help fol-
low 25 female great tits in the period before egg laying
at the National Park the Hoge Veluwe. Field work will
start March 9th already! Unfortunately we can not pay
a salary, but we can talk about travel expenses / acco-
modation. Students who want to make it a research
project are welcome too. We (me, another student &
you) will work 7 days a week for a period of 6 weeks to
collect the data (March 9th - April 17th).
The project focusses on the timing of egg laying. Tim-
ing of egg laying is important since climate change
shifted the optimal timing of egg laying earlier. Some
bird species, like the great tit, have not advanced egg
laying and are suﬀering from ’being too late’. Condi-
tions during the period before egg laying are likely to
be important for the timing of egg laying, however, al-
most nothing is known about what female great tits are
actually doing during this period of year! Therefore we
will measure food availability and monitor a number of
females (using radio telemetry) to see how they make
use of the available food. All this will take place in the
nest box population at the Hoge Veluwe in the Nether-
lands, which is one of the longest running tit studies in
the world.

Undergraduate Diversity at Evolution 2010
***Deadline March 1****
For the eighth consecutive year, the Undergraduate Di-
versity at SSE/SSB program, funded by the Undergrad-
uate Research and Mentoring in the Biological Sciences
(URM) program at NSF, will take place at the 2010
meeting of the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE)
and the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB) in Port-
land, OR. This year we again team up with staﬀ at the
National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent) to
send up to 25 undergraduates to the meetings to present
posters and receive mentoring from graduate students,
postdocs and faculty in evolutionary biology. For full
information and links to the application portal see
http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/edwards/-
community/application.html The deadline for
applications this year is March 1, 2010. Applications
can be made online through a special portal at the
National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent):
http://www.nescent.org/eog/-
signup evolution2010diversity.php . Applications
consist of a title, author line and abstract of the poster
to be presented by the undergraduate; a one-page
statement of academic interests and career goals; and
a letter of recommendation. The personal statement
should address how attending the Evolution meetings
will help meet these goals, and should indicate whether
or not the student plans to attend graduate school, if
this is known. The letter of recommendation, ideally
from the undergraduate’s research advisor, should
indicate how inclusion of the student will increase
diversity of the group participants. All materials
required for application can be found at the NESCent
application portal. Details on selection criteria areavailable at the program headquarters at the Harvard
web site.
We can only accept applications from students who
are US citizens or permanent residents. Applications
will be accepted only from students registered or very
recently graduated from U.S. institutions, including
Puerto Rico (i.e., no later than having ﬁnished classes
during the winter or spring semesters before the meet-
ing) and traveling to the meeting from within the US.
Students demonstrating a need for funds to attend
SSE/SSB will be given preference, and will be selected
so that as a group, they will maximize cultural diversity
among undergraduates at the meetings.

Q Value software help
In the past, I’ve used the q value software package to
control the false discovery rate when making large num-
ber of pairwise comparisons of gene frequencies or Fst
values (I’m one of those who feel that the typical Bon-
ferroni “correction” is too conservative for preliminary
surveys). However, I can’t get the latest versions of
the software to run on any of my computers, MAC OS
10.4.x, 10.5.x, or Windows XP Professional. In every
case, the program loads the P values from a text ﬁle,
but then “hangs” at the “Execute” stage. In each case,
I believe that I have the correct version of R (the sta-
tistical package that supports the Q value calculations)
installed and running, with the appropriate interface
also. However, I’m no “R” expert by any means, and
I could be making some obvious mistake that I’m (not
so blissfully) unaware of...
I would appreciate knowing if there is anyone out there
successfully running “Q value” on machines like mine,
and if so, can I get some advice? I have been unable to
contact any Q value support groups. Does the LINUX
version work better?
Thanks to all.

SexGenderBook CallForPapers
Call for papers:
CHALLENGING POPULAR MYTHS OF SEX, GEN-
DER AND BIOLOGY
This call for papers is for a transdisciplinary anthol-
ogy about gender and biology written by international
researchers, aimed at a public audience. Empirical re-
search in biology, psychology, and other life sciences
sometimes undergirds popular notions of female and
male sexual diﬀerence, while much of current biology
actually opens a space for variable and non-static views
of sex and gender; instead of emphasizing dichotomous
diﬀerence, the natural sciences may look into sameness
and the continuum of morphologies, behaviors and pro-
cesses in between. Our aim is to make these insights
public knowledge.
We would like to highlight diﬀerent areas of biology
and related disciplines that question popularly held
ideas of biology. There exist many popular concep-
tions about biology, sex, gender, and bodies that stem
from supposedly common-sense notions of gender, hu-
man evolution, biological processes animals in general,
and even life at the microbial level. Often these pop-
ular beliefs are distantly connected to the ideas devel-
oped and held by researchers in biology, archaeology
and medicine. Our goal is to deepen the understand-
ing of biology beyond these popular conceptions. We
want contributions that 1) explain areas where biolo-
gists/archaeologists/psychologists, etc. have a varied
view of sex/gender which is not known to the public
and/or 2) has a critical perspective on diﬀerent biolog-
ical topics pertaining to sex and gender.
Possible questions to explore include:
How does a recent understanding of developmental bi-
ology, rate of evolution, diversity of sexualities, the
anisogamy argument, parental investment and sexual
selection aﬀect our views of sex and gender? How can
a critical perspective shed light on topics like sexual
conﬂict, toy preference research, ideas about hunter-
gatherers? What is a statistically signiﬁcant biological
sex diﬀerence? - how can we explain variation within
and between categories? Where does brain research ﬁt
in constructing or challenging popular notions of diﬀer-ence between the sexes? How can we understand the
diversity and variation of sex within nature? How has
the notion of ?sex roles? been used to describe animal
behavior and what are the consequences?
Deadline for abstracts (approximately 300 words) and a
short CV: 1 May 2010 Selected submissions will be no-
tiﬁed at the latest by June 1, 2010. Completed chapters
(4000 words) will be due by August 31, 2010.

Software Arlequin ver 3 5
ARLEQUIN ver 3.5 —————-
A new version of the Arlequin software for popu-
lation genetic analyses is now available on http://-
cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin35/ The new version
of Arlequin is now available under three diﬀerent forms:
- a Windows graphical version (WINARL35), - a con-
sole version of Arlequin (ARLECORE), - a speciﬁc con-
sole version to compute summary statistics (ARLSUM-
STAT).
The console versions run under both Linux (32 and 64
bit versions) and Windows (32 bit).The main innovations of the new version include - en-
hanced outputs in XML format - the possibility to em-
bed graphics displaying computation results directly
into output ﬁles - implementation of a new method
to detect loci under selection from genome scans when
populations are hierarchically structured (Excoﬃer et
al. 2009).
More details are available on http://cmpg.unibe.ch/-
software/arlequin35/Arl35WhatsNew.html
Command-line versions are designed to handle
large series of ﬁles and ARLSUMSTAT can be used
to generate summary statistics from simulated data
sets within an Approximate Bayesian Computation
framework.

Steelco lab dishwashers
Hi all,
we are going to buy a new lab dishwasher for our core
cleaning facility (serving 3 insitutes, approx. 60 peo-
ple) and ended up with two oﬀers: a Steelco 610 for
EUR 26000.- and a Miele G7825 for EUR 43000.-; both
machines have more or less the same technical speciﬁ-
cations.
We all know that Miele builds excellent machines, but
the price diﬀerence is really staggering, and we wonder
if the quality of the cheaper machine will be ok. There-
fore I would appreciate any experiences the community
made with Steelco dishwashers.
Thanks & regards Wolfgang

ResExperienceUndergraduate
One Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
position is available in Dr. Jeﬀrey Feder’s Evolutionary
and Ecological Genetics Laboratory with the University
of Notre Dame for summer 2010.
Project Description: The main project the REU will
conduct will involve the monitoring of Rhagoletis
pomonella (the apple maggot ﬂy) in eclosion cages set
up the summer of 2009 to determine the eclosion curves
of diﬀerent populations; this is with the hypothesis that
the diﬀerent host races will eclose at a time that brieﬂy
precedes the ripening of their respective host fruit. In
addition to monitoring tents, the REU will also be in-
volved in setting up an experiment to investigate host
odor discrimination under natural conditions, driving
up and down the Paciﬁc Northwest to collect infested
fruit, and then processing subsequent pupae for further
experimentation. There also exists the opportunity for
the REU to conduct an independent project involving
questions related to the sympatric speciation of Rhago-
letis pomonella. A valid driver’s license and passport is
required, and the ability to identify trees from a moving
vehicle is preferred (some training will be involved).
Project Site Location: The Paciﬁc Northwest, the lab is
stationed in Vancouver, WA (20 minutes north of Port-
land, OR), but a lot of travelling up and down the I-5
corridor will be involved and trips to southern Oregon
and Canada are likely.
These REU positions are oﬀered through the University
of Notre Dame GLOBES program, and application ma-
terials and further information can be found at: http:/-
/globes.nd.edu/reu2010.shtml . Priority will be given to
applications postmarked by Feb. 12, 2010. Eligible can-
didates must be current sophomores and juniors, who
are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Women, mi-
nority students, disabled students, and students from
small colleges are encouraged to apply.

Zotero citation styles for
evolution-related journals
Dear colleagues,
I recently switched over to the open-source Zotero for
managing my references, PDFs, and citations within
manuscripts. They have quite a few citation styles, but
are lacking many for evolution-related journals. (see
http://www.zotero.org/ if interested in the software).
In particular, I am wondering if anyone has created a
style for “Molecular Ecology”. This journal uses the
Harvard reference format, but with several slight mod-
iﬁcations. Zotero styles are written in a markup lan-
guage, so I thought I would ask before learning the code
and reinventing the wheel!
If anyone has styles for other related journals, then I
would be happy to collect them and get them on the
Zotero website for public use.

EvolutionDrosophilaImmunity
A postdoctoral position is available to apply genome-
wide association mapping (GWAS) to identify the ge-
netic basis for resistance to bacterial infection and other
ﬁtness-related traits in Drosophila. The project will be
performed in collaboration with Profs. Brian Lazzaro
and Jason Mezey at Cornell University on the Cornell
main campus in Ithaca, NY. The aims of the project
will be to identify genetic polymorphisms that underlie
natural variation in resistance to infection under a vari-
ety of nutritional and other environmental conditions,
and to develop methods for GWAS analysis that are
optimal for handling the complexity inherent in map-
ping phenotypes in a highly polymorphic organism like
Drosophila. The project will be primarily lab based,
with lab work and appointee housing located in the
Lazzaro Lab, but should also include a substantial com-
putational component, which will be undertaken under
the supervision of Dr. Mezey. We are therefore look-
ing for candidates who have good experience in em-
pirical quantitative genetics and strong computational
and analytical skills. Background in Drosophila and/or
immunity will be considered a plus. The position is
available immediately, although start date can be ne-
gotiated. Applications will be continuously reviewed
until a suitable candidate is found. The initial appoint-
ment will be made for one year, with the expectation
of renewal for a second year pending satisfactory per-
formance and available research funds. Salary will be
on the NIH scale. Cornell is an equal opportunity em-
ployer.

HostChoice in Anopheles gambiae
A Post-Doctoral position is available to conduct NIH-
funded research in the Slotman lab in the Department
of Entomology at Texas A&M University. The Slot-
man lab is interested in the evolutionary genetics of
malaria mosquitoes, with an emphasis on the Anophe-
les gambiae complex. The major malaria vector in this
complex, An. gambiae s.s, strongly prefers blood feed-
ing on humans and it is strongly attracted to the smell
of human sweat. This anthropophily, or preference for
humans, is one the main reasons An. gambiae is such
an eﬃcient malaria vector.
The successful candidate will investigate the genetic ba-
sis of host choice in An. gambiae using gene expression
approaches. The ultimate goal of the project is to iden-
tify olfaction genes responsible for the attraction of An.
gambiae to humans. The results of this research would
contribute greatly to our understanding of the biology
of this important disease vector, and could promote theMarch 1, 2010 EvolDir 65
development of novel malaria control methods.
The successful candidate should have an interest in vec-
tor biology, and/or evolutionary biology. Experience
with gene expression analyses is strongly preferred. Be-
sides executing the planned research, the candidate will
have the opportunity to design her/his own research
project. Starting date is negotiable, but should be no

POST-DOC IN SEXUAL SELECTION AND SPECI-
ATION IN MAMMALS
We are looking for a motivated post-doc to join our
group to study the role of sexual selection in speciation
in rodents.
The aim of the project is to understand whether sperm
competition promotes rapid changes in reproductive
traits and genes which lead to gametic isolation be-
tween populations and eventually to speciation. We are
interested in identyfying which evolutionary changes in
spermatozoa and ovum traits constitute reproductive
barriers between divergent populations, as well as the
underlying molecular changes. The project deals with66 EvolDir March 1, 2010
diﬀerent levels: (a) comparative study between species
with diﬀerent levels of sperm competition; (b) intraspe-
ciﬁc studies looking at the degree of variation found in
natural populations at the phenotypic and molecular
level. Our model system are several species of rodents,
some of which are kept in animal facilities, while others
are captured in the ﬁeld.
The study involves intensive laboratory work to anal-
yse semen quality and sperm traits, to carry out in vitro
fertilization experiments, and to analyse candidate re-
productive genes.
We are looking for candidates with a solid evolutionary
background and experience in reproductive physiology
and/or molecular biology. A PhD in molecular evolu-
tion or reproductive physiology would be ideal.

MPI Ploen SexualSelection
Postdoctoral position: sexual selection in Saccha-
romyces
*Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen,
Germany*
Experimental Evolution group, led by Duncan Greig
We are looking for a post-doc to work on sexual se-
lection in budding yeast. Yeast sex cells produce
pheromones that attract mates, but it is not clear what
information this signal carries, or why the system has
evolved. One possibility is that the sex pheromone is
an honest signal of mate quality that has evolved under
the handicap principle (see Pagel, 1993). To evaluate
this hypothesis, we need to determine the conditions
and circumstances under which yeast has sex in na-
ture, and assay signal strength, mate preference, and
ﬁtness using experiments in appropriate environments.
We also use yeast as a laboratory model system for sex-
ual selection experiments (Rogers and Greig, 2008), and
are developing the system to test the predictions and
underlying assumptions of speciﬁc genetic mechanisms
of sexual selection.
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology is
a well-funded, expanding, and vibrant research insti-
tution, with superb facilities. It is located in Ploen,
an attractive small town surrounded by lakes, a few
kilometres from the Baltic coast. Neighbouring larger
towns are Kiel and Lubeck, and the international air-port at Hamburg is 80km away. Further information
on the institute can be found at:
http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/english/index.html The
position is potentially suitable for any level of postdoc
and will initially be funded for two years, with an ex-
tension for an additional year if appropriate. The ideal
candidate would be an evolutionary biologist with ex-
pertise in an appropriate area such as sexual selection
or the evolution of sex, as well as laboratory experience
in yeast molecular genetics and genetic manipulation.
However evolutionists with practical experience of an-
other organism, or yeast geneticists with a strong inter-
est in evolutionary biology are also encouraged to apply.
Funding is available from March 1st 2010, and comes
in two forms depending on nationality. Foreigners can
receive between 2100 and 3000 Euro per month, de-
pending on experience, which is free from income taxes
and social insurance contributions. Germans receive
a similar grant, calculated according to several factors
such as age, marital and family status.

http://www.ncl.ac.uk/microbial eukaryotes/ Brief
background to the project: Microsporidia are op-
portunistic intracellular parasites that cause chronic
diarrhoea in children and the elderly, especially in
the developing World and they frequently infect
patients with HIV/AIDS. They are among the simplest
eukaryotic cells known, having lost many metabolic
pathways common to other eukaryotes and have
greatly simpliﬁed the structure and functions of their
organelles. As a consequence, Microsporidia are ideal
model systems for identifying the truly indispensable
features of eukaryotic cells. Recent data from our
laboratory suggest that mitosomes, the basic mito-
chondria found in Microsporidia, house enzymes that
are vital for parasite survival (Nature, 452, 624-628;
Nature 453, 553-556; Nature, 418: 865-869). The
aim of this project is now to fully determine the
essential function(s) of these minimal mitochondria.
The work has far reaching importance because: (i) it
will provide functional data for an organelle that is
essential for the survival of major human parasites and
(ii) it will challenge the long-held hypothesis (Nature,
440: 623-630) that the key function of mitochondriaMarch 1, 2010 EvolDir 69
(deﬁned in the broadest sense) in eukaryotic cells is
to make ATP. The techniques to be used include core
molecular biology, parasite culture and cell fraction-
ation, proteomics, and immuno-localisation of key
proteins using confocal light microscopy. The success-
ful candidates will join a research group working at
the forefront of international eﬀorts to understand the
fundamental biology and evolution of Microsporidia.
Our collaborators include Dr Eva Heinz (Newcastle) a
Marie Curie Post Doctoral Fellow who is working on
microsporidian genomics and transport proteins, Prof.
Roland Lill (Marburg, Germany) a World leader in the
ﬁeld of mitochondrial iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis
(Nature 460 831-838), Dr Edmund Kunji (Cambridge,

proteins (PNAS 105: 17766-71), Prof. Jan Tachezy
(Prague, Czech Republic) a parasitologist and expert
on mitosomes (PNAS 102: 10924-9), and Dr Adrian

staﬀ in his lab will study the detailed ultrastructure

a mutually supportive network of expertise to solve the
outstanding problems in the biology of microsporidian
mitosomes. The successful candidate will be expected
to liaise with other members of the network, to travel
between labs for short research visits to learn new

ment and breeding systems, host-parasite interactions
in diﬀerent environments and implications of inbreed-
ing for the conservation of endangered species. The
populations of North African ungulate species kept at
the PRFS ( http://www.eeza.csic.es/eeza/parque.aspx )
for the captive-breeding programs, as well as the
infrastructures and information accumulated in the
studbooks provide excellent research opportunities.

The second position will be responsible for whole-
genome sequencing and analysis of the mutation accu-
mulation lines, and a set of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
sampled from the wild, as well as an isolate of the re-
lated species Chlamydomonas incerta. These data will
be analysed by state of the art evolutionary genomics
techniques. The position will also involve giving some
help with phenotypic assays of the mutation accumu-
lation lines. Experience in molecular evolution and/or
computational biology would be highly advantageous.
The research would all be carried out within the
Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the University
of Edinburgh ( http://www.biology.ed.ac.uk/research/-
institutes/evolution/ ). This vibrant and diverse insti-
tute houses a group of internationally recognised re-
searchers investigating a wide range of questions within

Project - Host-symbiont coevolution: Exploring theparasitism-mutualism continuum
An enthusiastic, dedicated postdoctoral research assis-
tant is sought for a 3-year NERC-funded project that
will use experimental evolution allied with genome re-
sequencing to study coevolution across the parasitism-
mutualism continuum. While both parasitism and mu-
tualism are common ways of life, relatively little is
known about how antagonistic and mutualistic coevo-
lution diﬀer. In this project, we will exploit the natural
variation in the relationship between a plasmid and its
bacterial host, associated with diﬀerent environmental
conditions, to examine in detail the consequences of
parasitism and mutualism for the tempo and mode of
evolution of both parties in a symbiosis. A complete
evolutionary genetic picture of coevolution will be cre-
ated through utilizing the recent advances in second
generation sequencing technologies (454, illumina etc.).
The experimental evolution and/or comparative ge-
nomics research would be desirable. Training in anal-
ysis of next-generation sequencing data and bioinfor-
matics will be provided. The post-holder will per-
form long-term selection experiments; whole genome
re-sequencing; bioinformatics; statistical analysis;
manuscript preparation; and assist in lab management.
The post will be based in the School of Biological Sci-
ences, University of Liverpool under the supervision of
Dr Michael Brockhurst and Dr Steve Paterson.
The post is available for 3-years from May 2010 (or
until a suitable candidate is found). Deadline for appli-
cations is the 15th March 2010. Informal enquiries to

HostParasiteCoevolution
Postdoctoral Project Leader: Bioinformatic analy-
sis of the genetic basis of host-parasite coevolution
(SPP1399)
A three-year postdoctoral position with the possibil-
ity of extension is available as part of the DFG funded
priority programme SPP 1399 “Host-Parasite Coevolu-
tion” ( http://ieb.uni-muenster.de/spp/ ).
This newly founded priority programme comprises 21
individual projects and seeks to study evolution in ac-
tion, by means of one of the most dynamic processes
known in evolution, the host-parasite coevolutionaryarms race. The goal of this speciﬁc postdoc project
is to unravel the genetic basis of coevolutionary adap-
tation, that is parasite infectivity and host immune
defense in coevolving antagonists. The priority pro-
gramme provides unique access to genomic data from
hosts and parasites with a known history of coevolu-
tion. The immediate focus of the postdoc project is to
characterize and analyse genomic changes in Bacillus
thuringiensis microparasites that have undergone ex-
perimental coevolution with nematode and arthropod
hosts. For this purpose, whole-genome sequence and
also transcriptome data will be available for micropar-
asites before and after coevolution. The available mate-
rial will allow us to identify genes, structural elements,
and regulatory networks involved in reciprocal adapta-
tion and also the associated patterns of molecular evolu-
tion (negative vs. positive selection, etc). Work ranges
from genome assembly, characterization of SNPs during
coevolution, identiﬁcation of changes in gene regulation
from transcriptomic data, to analysis of molecular evo-
lution. The postdoc will also have the opportunity to
contribute to establishment of a platform that shall en-
hance accessibility and thus exchange of data within
the priority programme.
Speciﬁcs and future directions of the postdoc project
can be tailored to the interests of and developed to-
gether with the successful candidate who is expected to
be in a good position to publish in esteemed journals.
The postholder will be based in Muenster as part of the
Molecular Evolution and Bioinformatics Group of Prof.
Erich Bornberg-Bauer. The ﬁrst part of the postdoc
project will include intensive interaction with the group
of Prof. Hinrich Schulenburg (Kiel University) and the
associated genomics analysis platform, which generated
the material to be analysed. Future projects will involve
interactions with experimentalists in Muenster (Prof.
Joachim Kurtz), Kiel (Prof. Thorsten Reusch, IFM-
GEOMAR), and other participants of the priority pro-
gramme..
Postholders will apply a wide range of bioinformat-
ics techniques and supervise an assistant for mainte-
nance of technical infrastructure. Accordingly, good
knowledge of biological databases, bioinformatics pro-
grammes and scripting in languages such as Python,
Perl or Ruby is essential. Further required qualiﬁ-
cations are: * PhD in natural sciences and research
experience in a biological area OR * PhD in com-
puter science, statistics or bioinformatics with experi-
ence and/or desire to excel in a biological area * Mo-
tivation and proven ability to carry out research inde-

of two years) post-doctoral position is available in the
Kolm group at the department of Animal Ecology, Up-
psala University. The project aims at investigating the
evolution of brain size and brain structure in ﬁshes us-
ing a combination of phylogenetic comparative analyses
and lab experiments.
The foundation of the project is an existing database
on brain size and brain structure in Tanganyikan cichlid
ﬁsh species. This database, together with a molecular
phylogeny and a database on ecological, sexually se-
lected and life-history traits provide a strong basis forphylogenetic comparative analyses of brain evolution.
The post-doc will also collect a new dataset on brain
size and structure for Syngnathid ﬁshes (pipeﬁshes and
seahorses), a group with sex-role reversal and paternal
care, which provides an interesting contrast to the ci-
chlid ﬁshes.
Depending on the speciﬁc interests of the applicant,
there will also be opportunities for experimental work
on brain evolution and its implementations for sexual
selection and life-history evolution using an artiﬁcial se-
lection approach, as well as experimental work on the
link between cognitive ability and brain structure in a
poeciliid ﬁsh. A well-equipped ﬁsh lab is available for
these experiments. Together, these approaches aim at
providing novel insights into the patterns of brain evo-
lution in vertebrates.
The successful applicant should have a PhD in evolu-
tionary biology. A strong interest in cognitive ecology is
important and experience in modern phylogenetic com-
parative analysis is considered a merit even though the
project will oﬀer good chances of acquiring such skills
for the right candidate. Experience in general ﬁsh ecol-
ogy and ﬁsh dissection is also welcome but not essential.
The net salary is 20000 SEK/month ( ~1980 Euros) (not
subject to Swedish income tax).
The Evolutionary Biology Centre at Uppsala Univer-
sity is one of Europe’s ﬁnest and largest institutions
in its ﬁeld and hosts 15 departments working on the
levels of genes, organisms and communities. This pro-
vides for outstanding possibilities for cross-disciplinary
interactions. See http://www.ebc.uu.se/index eng.php
for further information.
Applications (2 copies) should include a brief descrip-
tion of research interests and past research experience,
Curriculum vitae and the name and contact informa-
tion of 2 personal references. Relevant publications
should be attached to the application. Application
dead-line is 15th of March 2010 and the project is
planned to start as soon as possible after mid April 2010
but some ﬂexibility in starting-date can be provided.

Evolutionary Biology Workshop in the Alps20 - 26 June, Arolla, Switzerland
Faculty: David Haig (Harvard University) John Pan-
nell (University of Oxford) Jerome Goudet (University
of Lausanne) Tad Kawecki (University of Lausanne)
Target participants: PhD students, advanced master
students This workshop, based on a concept developed
by Steve Stearns and John Maynard Smith, takes placeMarch 1, 2010 EvolDir 79
in a small Alpine village (Arolla), which will allow you
to focus while being able to enjoy the landscape and
the Alpine ﬂora. The main goals of this course are to
develop the following skills: - developing your scientiﬁc
ideas through discussions in groups; - thinking critically
and expressing oneself clearly; - turning a general idea
into a research project; - writing a research proposal
and defending it. It is you, the students, who will be
in charge in this course. You will be divided in groups
of 4-5 students. In those groups, you will work on your
ideas. You, as a group, will decide what the important
questions in broadly deﬁned evolutionary biology are,
you will choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal
for a research project that will address it. The faculty
will visit the groups during the discussions to answer
your questions, provide coaching and give you feedback
on your projects, but they will generally take the back
seat. Additionally, the faculty will give informal talks
about their research and be available for informal dis-
cussion with individual students. At the end you will
present your projects to other participants, and we will
party.
Costs: CHF 430.- for room and board.

The Paleo-DNA Laboratory at Lakehead University in
Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada is oﬀering the opportu-
nity to participate in our annual Ancient DNA Training
Program. This year we are delivering the course from
May 10th to 28th, 2010.
During this hands-on laboratory and lecture program,
participants are taught various extraction, puriﬁcation,
and ampliﬁcation methodologies applied to ancient, de-
graded or damaged DNA. They will also be provided
instruction in data analysis. They will analyse their
own blood, buccal, and hair samples and generate their
own nuclear DNA proﬁle, determine their own mito-
chondrial haplotype, and learn sex identiﬁcation and
DNA sequencing. The methodology will include Poly-
merase Chain Reaction (PCR), PCR-RFLP (Restric-
tion Fragment Length Polymorphism), multiplex PCR,
sequencing, and gel and capillary electrophoresis. Stu-
dents will practice preparing samples from a number of
diﬀerent tissue types such as bone, teeth, hair, blood
residues and mummiﬁed tissue.
Students will learn to recognize the use of genetic anal-
ysis and its potential in evolutionary biology, archaeo-
zoology, palaeopathology, archaeology, forensic science,
palaeobotany and palaeontology. Lectures by experts in
the ﬁelds of archaeology, genetics, ancient DNA, foren-
sic science, palaeopathology and more are integrated
with the laboratory sessions.

Hi folks,
I am pleased to announce details of our 10-week Under-
graduate Summer School programme in evolutionary
biology, funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).
We have funding for 10 students for 10 weeks, starting
June 8th.
Students from all over the world can apply and they
will be funded to the tune of 300 Euro per week (though
some of this money must be used to cover accommoda-
tion).
In addition, for students traveling from outside Ireland,
there is some funding to help defray travel costs.
Students should not be in the ﬁnal year of their de-
gree course (i.e. students should be returning to Uni-
versity after the summer), but students that are taking
courses in any discipline related to evolutionary biology
(bioinformatics, ecology, etc.) are encouraged to apply.
Student acceptance is judged by a short statement of
coursework and a short personal statement.
We have been hugely oversubscribed for the past two
years, so applicants should ensure that the personal
statement is informative.
The web address for the course is:
http://bioinf.nuim.ie/ureka/ The email address for the
course is:

Online SpeciesTrees Feb24
Noah Rosenberg (U. Michigan) will be giving a
freely accessible online seminar concerning “Consis-
tency properties of species tree inference algorithms un-
der the multispecies coalescent” Wednesday, February
24 at 1pm PST.
To learn about how to attend this and other similar
seminars, please visit http://phyloseminar.org/ . Ab-
stract: The topologies of gene trees that evolve along
the branches of a species tree need not match the
species tree topology. As a result of this discordance,
when gene tree evolution is assumed to follow a “mul-
tispecies coalescent” model, simple phylogenetic algo-
rithms can exhibit peculiar statistical inconsistencies in
inferring species trees. This talk will examine the sta-
tistical consistency under the multispecies coalescent of
several algorithms - based on consensus trees, ranked
gene trees, and the “minimize deep coalescences” al-
gorithm. A summary will be presented of the known
consistency properties of the various algorithms.Erick Matsen <ematsen@gmail.com >

Vision
Computational Phyloinformatics is an 11-day inten-
sive summer course co-sponsored by BGI-Shenzhen and
the U.S. National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NES-
Cent), and will take place at the BGI-Shenzhen ge-
nomics institute in Yah Tian District, Shenzhen, China.
The venue is in proximity to beaches, national forests,
and holiday resorts. The course aims to give students
practical knowledge and hands-on programming skills
in phyloinformatics.
SYNOPSIS Biologists are faced with ever-larger
datasets, more complex evolutionary models, and in-
creasingly elaborate analytical methods. Seldom is it
suﬃcient to run a dataset with an oﬀ-the-shelf pro-
gram on a desktop PC; increasingly, biologists need
to write scripts to interface with internet services and
databases, build analytical pipelines, customize analy-
ses, and distribute computation over multiple proces-
sors. This course is designed for graduate students,
postdocs, and researchers in phylogenetics interested in
receiving practical, hands-on training in the use of Perl
and SQL for phyloinformatics applications.
The course is divided into three parts:
ˆ a Part I: A tutorial review of of Perl, including object
oriented programming and building packages
ˆ a Part II: Introduction and practical use of BioPerl and
Bio::Phylo, (e.g. scripting for large tree inference en-
gines, automating model testing, supertree assembly,
rate smoothing and branch calibration, tree traversal,
etc).
ˆ a Part III: Introduction to database design; computing
and querying nested sets and transitive closure; topo-
logical querying of both large trees (e.g. NCBI) and
large collections of trees (e.g. TreeBASE)..
Students will learn how to write basic phylogenetic or
comparative analysis scripts, parse NEXUS ﬁles, tra-
verse and compute over trees, and make practical use
of phylogenetic software libraries. These skills will be
learned in a biological context, touching on a diverse
array of topics such as analysis of large datasets, au-
tomation of supertree assembly, querying for topologi-
cal patterns in large collections of trees, etc.
INSTRUCTORS Darin London, William Piel, Rutger
Vos
PREREQUISITES Biology: A solid understand-
ing of phylogenetics (e.g. familiarity with MP,
ML, BI, NJ, substitution models, tree searching,86 EvolDir March 1, 2010
bootstrapping, etc) ˆ a for example, having already
taken the Workshop on Molecular Evolution ( http://-
www.molecularevolution.org/ ), Bodega Applied Phylo-
genetics Workshop ( http://bodegaphylo.wikispot.org/-
), or equivalent coursework or experience.
Computing: Prior experience with Perl or careful study
of the suggested reading materials (see web site). Stu-
dents should have experience with basic Unix shell com-
mands. All students are expected to bring either their
own Mac OSX computer or a LINUX computer; other-
wise LINUX computers will be provided.
FEES Full tuition is ˆA6,800 ( ~$996), and includes
lunches, coﬀee, computer equipment, and an outing on
one of two free days. Students are free to ﬁnd their own
accommodation, but shuttle service is oﬀered to/from
the recommended hotels: Pattaya Hotel and East Coast
Blue Club Hotel, located near Dameisha beach.
HOW TO APPLY Apply through the course website.
You will be asked to provide a resume and a motivation
statement (including a self-assessment of your skills,
experience, and knowledge of both phylogenetics and
computing). Applications are due by April 5 2010.

Course description:
Currently, the simplest Bioinformatics analysis uses
species comparisons in order to hypothesise the func-
tion of a novel biological sequence. Moreover, in
most Molecular Biology labs, evolutionary and phylo-
genetic concepts are constantly being used with more
or less formality: homology, similarity, evolutionary
rates, long branch attraction, rooted and unrooted
trees, monophyletic group, molecular clock, adapta-
tion, lineage eﬀects, neutralism, cladograms, phylo-
grams, etc. The course aims to provide the necessary
background to understand the basic concepts from com-
parative and evolutionary biology that are frequently
used in molecular biology and bioinformatics analyses.
The course consists in ﬁve full-day sessions with an
adequate balance between theory and computer prac-
tice, oriented to solve frequent problems and hypoth-
esis testing. The program covers the basic and ad-
vanced analysis of Phylogenetic reconstruction, Phy-
logenomic analysis of genomes and Maximum likeli-
hood tests for molecular adaptation. The software re-
sources that will be used in the practical sessions in-
clude: Phyml, Phylip, MEGA, TreePuzzle, MrBayes,
PAML, Modeltest-Protest, Jmodeltest and the Phyle-
mon web server.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
