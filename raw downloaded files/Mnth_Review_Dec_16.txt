scapes, big data and the predictability of evolution
Evolutionary biology has become increasingly powerful
in inferring past evolutionary processes from patterns
in present-day genomes. However, forecasting evolu-
tion's future routes remains an exciting intellectual chal-
lenge with substantial implications for global health
and species conservation. The concept of the tness
landscape has been central to recent studies of the pre-
dictability of evolution, and has inspired evolutionary bi-
ologists and mathematicians alike. Combining microbial
experimental evolution with next-generation sequencing,
eorts have now been made to rigorously test for the
repeatability and dynamics of evolution. At the sametime, theoretical studies try to provide the necessary
navigational tools for exploring the terra incognita of
molecular evolutionary biology. This symposium aims
to identify the key issues and challenges { both method-
ological and theoretical - to advance our understanding
of the predictability of evolution, particularly in the
light of \big data". We anticipate that insights from
our symposium will stimulate and direct future studies
of the predictability of evolution. With next-generation
sequencing on board, tness landscapes are heading for
new shores: It's now time to check whether \there be
dragons"!

Aug2017
We are pleased to invite you all to submit abstracts for
our symposium \Integrating micro- and macroevolution"
planned for European Society for Evolutionary Biology
meeting in Groningen, Netherlands 20-25th of August
2017.
[S29] Integration of micro- and macroevolution
Evolutionary biology studies the patterns and pro-
cesses that shape biodiversity over long and short
timescales. Traditionally microevolution focused on
within-species dynamics in a short temporal perspec-
tive, while macroevolution deals with both within- and
between species patterns and processes over longer pe-
riods of time. Although many macroevolutionary pat-
terns still lack explanations that follow from microevo-
lutionary theory and observations, exiting new devel-
opments now allow both micro- and macroevolution-
ary approaches to converge on understanding biological
variation within the context of genomic organization,
historical constraint, contingency as well as elucidating
biotic and abiotic drivers of evolutionary change. The in-
creasing genetic resolution provided by next-generation-
sequencing technology impacts studies of both micro
and macro-evolution; phylogenetic analyses are now in-
creasingly based on many markers and include genome
organization, and functional traits are commonly being
linked to causal genetic determinants. It is now also pos-
sible to combine palaeontological and neontological data
in the same analysis framework. In this symposium, we
will explore insights from such new developments and
their potential for determining the research agenda for
evolutionary biology. Contributions shall address fun-
damental questions regarding the integration of macro-
and microevolution, for instance how can macroevolu-
tionary studies inform hypotheses of microevolutionary
change and vice versa?

ESEB SYMPOSIUM ON INVERSIONS & SUPER-
GENES
Dear Colleagues:
We would like to invite you to attend and/or contribute
to the ESEB symposium
\The Evolutionary Signicance of Chromosomal Inver-
sions" [S18]
which will take place at the 16th Congress of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in
Groningen, Netherlands, 20-25 August 2017.
INVITED SPEAKERS: Mark Kirkpatrick (Austin)
Michael Fontaine (Groningen)
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Chromosomal inver-
sions represent common structural mutations that re-
sult in the reversal of gene order in the corresponding
state, they have been associated with evolutionary pro-
cesses that involve reduced recombination and gene ow
such as speciation and sex chromosome evolution. In-
versions might also play a pivotal role in adaptation.
For example, inversions might act as adaptive \super-
genes" by keeping together coadapted gene complexes
or by protecting locally adapted alleles from maladap-
tive gene ow. Consistent with adaptive eects, sev-
eral inversion polymorphisms exhibit strong, persistent
frequency clines and have been associated with tness-
related traits. Despite almost 100 years of research on
inversions since their discovery by Sturtevant in 1921,
we are still far from fully understanding the mechanisms
whereby inversion polymorphisms are maintained in nat-
ural populations and how selection acts on them. Recent
advances in population genetic theory and genomics
are now beginning to shed light on these fundamental
questions. With this symposium we seek to foster a
discussion between theorists and experimentalists about
the causes and consequences of inversion evolution.
http://www.eseb2017.nl/sub/s18-the-evolutionary-

Complex life has evolved through a series of evolutionary
transitions in individuality. During these transitions,
existing individuals merged to become parts of a new
higher-level individual, which consists of specialised sub-
units that divide labour. Recent years have seen major
advances in the eld that were enabled by experiments
examining the origin of chemical replicators capable of
Darwinian evolution, the evolution of simple multicellu-
lar organisms from single-celled ancestors in test tubes,
solitary organisms attaining a group-living lifestyle, the
origin and evolution of digital organisms in silico, and
work examining how symbioses can lead to the origin of
new organisms. Moreover, some of the exciting discov-
eries made in this eld sparked intensive debate among
philosophers on how organisms should be dened.
Drawing on this diverse work, our symposium will high-
light recent developments in this rapidly progressing
area. By bringing together empirical, theoretical, and
philosophical contributions, this symposium will not
only facilitate discussions among scientists that other-
wise would not meet, but will also help identify priorities8 EvolDir December 1, 2016

Conference: Flexibility matters: Interplay between trait
diversity and ecological dynamics using aquatic commu-
nities as model systems
The conference will address trait-based ecology with a
focus on biomass-trait feedbacks and eco-evolutionary
dynamics typically arising from trophic interactions. We
aim to bridge between theoretically guided empirical
eld and laboratory studies and data-informed devel-
opment of theory and modelling. The meeting will
provide opportunities to exchange ideas and results
with members of the DFG funded Priority Program
DynaTrait and guests through a series of contributed
and invited talks, poster sessions and small workinggroups. The meeting focuses on aquatic systems, but
other systems are welcome as well if results are su-
ciently generalizable. For more information and list

Dear all,
I'd like to let the community know that the registration
has opened for the /Insect Genomics Special Interest
Group meeting/ of the /Royal Entomological Society/.
The development of the new sequencing technologies has
placed the eld of genomics at the heart of biological re-
search. Many genomes have already been published and
many more are being generated. This abundance of ge-
nomic data is proving to be fundamental to a wide range
of research areas including functional genomics, the evo-
lution of diversity and insect management.The purpose
of this meeting is to discuss the latest developments in
the eld of genomics and how they are being applied
in entomology. We will bring together researchers with
dierent backgrounds to promote the exchange of ideas
and explore collaborations that can further advance
insect science.
We welcome presentations from researchers at all stages
of their careers working on insect genomics and the
development of bioinformatics tools, as well as from
those applying these methods to study questions rang-
ing from insect ecology and evolution to management
and control.
We are really excited to have Nicola Nadeau (University
of Sheeld), Chris Bass (Unversity of Exeter) and Luke
Alphey (The Pirbright Institute) as invited speakers.
It will take place on the 16th of May 2017 at Rotham-
sted Research, Harpenden, UK. The registration fee is
15 to cover for lunch, tea/coee and a wine/refreshment
reception during the poster session.
The deadline for abstract submission is the 16th ofDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 9

Univ., Justin Fay, Washington Univ. in St. Louis
MEETING DESCRIPTION Evolutionary processes op-
erate at all levels of gene expression, and increasingly
detailed mechanistic understanding has provided rich
hunting grounds for pathways and processes which un-
derlie evolutionary variation, providing the molecular ex-
planation for the beaks of Darwin's nches, for example.
Most studies that have tracked down detailed molecular
changes linked to the evolution of morphological varia-
tion have highlighted the importance of cis- ^A'^ avariation,
as well as changes to sequence- ^A'^ aespecic transcrip-
tion factors. Such changes are expected to have less
pleiotropic eects than alterations in the core transcrip-
tional machinery, however new evidence points to high
levels of complexity in what was initially assumed to
be conserved core transcription machinery, suggesting
that variation in these components are likely to play
similar roles in evolutionary variation. Similarly, genetic
variation in core machinery for protein translation has
been shown to be associated with a variety of human
diseases, providing a glimpse of the likely variation that
underlies population- ^A'^ adierences relevant to studies
of \personalized genomics" in humans.

other. As they do, they diversify, diverge, and grade
away from and into one another. One result of this is
genealogical discordance, i.e., the lineages of a biologi-
cal entity may have dierent histories. We see this on
numerous levels, from microbial networks, to holobionts,
to population-level lineages.
The focus of this project is whether and how genealogi-
cal and other sorts of biological discordance impact our
views on species. Other kinds of relevant discordance
might include geographic discordance due to habitat
fragmentation and human mediated dispersal of species
in new environments, discordant government policies
which aect populations that straddle or migrate across
international borders, and discordant use of language
or theoretical terms between researchers in dierent
disciplines.
To promote a cross-disciplinary examination of this ques-
tion, investigators from a variety of elds will participate
in a series of interdisciplinary meetings. This includes
researchers working on phylogenetics, microbiology, sym-
biosis, population genetics, taxonomy, philosophy, and
history.
The Utah meeting is the rst of three meetings on this
topic. Follow up sessions are tentatively planned for
the 2017 Evolution Meeting (Portland, OR) and the
2017 ISHPSSB Meeting (Sao Paulo, Brazil). The Utah
meeting will be a mix of invited and refereed papers

ComparativeBiology
American Museum of Natural History Richard Gilder
Graduate School Comparative Biology Ph.D. Program
and Graduate Fellowships Program
The AMNH RGGS Ph.D. Program in Comparative Biol-
ogy is training the next generation of biologists through
an integrative approach that focuses on the history, evo-
lutionary relationships, and interactions among species.
It utilizes the Museum's strength and experience in
research and training to educate a new generation of
scientists and industry leaders. The AMNH provides ex-
ceptional support facilities for student research, with col-
lections of more than 33 million specimens and artifacts.
Training and research opportunities exist across a wide
array of disciplines in comparative biology, incorporating
research in systematic and evolutionary biology, pale-
ontology, conservation biology, comparative genomics,
computational biology, Earth history, anthropology, and
biological and cultural diversity. Global eldwork, with
AMNH faculty, student-led or in partnership with others,
provides exceptional research opportunities for students.
RGGS students may take advantage of RGGS course
cross-enrollment agreements with partner universities
Columbia and the City University of New York. Armed
with a Gilder School education, graduates will not only
understand the history and diversity of life on Earth, but
may contribute to advances in human health, biodiver-
sity conservation, and other related biological research
elds as well.
This is an accelerated program, designed for students
to complete their degrees in four years. Students will
earn a minimum of 62 credits through a combination of
coursework, teaching assistantships, and individual dis-
sertation research. The Richard Gilder Graduate School
will typically provide full nancial support to students
matriculating in the Comparative Biology Ph.D. Pro-
gram.
We also oer Graduate Fellowships for students inter-
ested in earning a Ph.D. at one of our partner institu-
tions (Columbia University, CUNY, NYU, Stony Brookand Cornell University), when they are advised by an
AMNH curator.
The AMNH Graduate Student Fellowship Program is
an educational partnership with selected universities,
dedicated to the training of Ph.D. candidates in those
scientic disciplines practiced at the Museum. Our
current collaborations are with Columbia University,
City University of New York (CUNY), Cornell Univer-
sity, Stony Brook University, and New York University
(NYU). The host university in which the student en-
rolls exercises educational jurisdiction over the students
and formally awards the degree. In these partnership
programs, at least one Museum curator must serve as a
graduate advisor, co-major professor or major professor,
and adjunct university faculty member. Each student
benets by having the sta and facilities of both the
university and the Museum to support his/her training
and research. To be eligible for the AMNH Graduate
Fellowship, students must apply to both the host Uni-
versity's Ph.D. program and to the AMNH Graduate
Student Fellowships Program. Students already matric-
ulated in a Ph.D. program are not eligible to apply; only
new, rst-time Ph.D. applicants will be considered.

Graduate positions in ecological speciation and the evo-
lution of life history timing in the Powell lab at Bing-
hamton University
I am currently seeking one or two PhD students to join
my lab ( www.powellevolab.com) in the fall semester of
2017. Our work is broadly focused on understanding
how ecological processes, physiological systems, genetic
variation, and genome structure interact during the
origin of species and adaptation to novel niches and
changes environments. We are particularly interested in
understanding the origin and maintenance of diversity
in specialist insect communities. Graduate students in
my lab will have opportunities to address these ques-
tions from a range of approaches, from eld work and
physiological assays to transcriptomics and population
genomics, and I am specically looking for students that
are interested in engaging in integrative work for their
dissertations.
Current work in the lab is centered on two classic study
systems: Rhagoletis fruit ies and goldenrod gall ies.
Students will have opportunities to develop indepen-
dent dissertation projects that contribute to the long
term research goals of the lab, including contributions
to a recently funded NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity
project on the coevolution of life history timing among
Rhagoletis ies and their parasitoid wasps and the use
of this system as a model for evolutionary responses of
communities to altered phenology under climate change.
Students will be supported on teaching assistantship
lines through the Department of Biological Sciences
(https://www.binghamton.edu/biology/), and be en-
rolled (tuition waived) in the EEB (Ecology, Evolution,
and Behavior) track of our doctoral program. The EEB
group at Binghamton is comprised of several active re-
search groups with considerable overlap in fundamental
research interests with our lab. This includes labs fo-
cused on coevolution, quantitative genetics and complex
traits, ecological speciation in plants, genomic variation
in natural populations, insect-plant interactions, and
evolutionary responses to anthropogenic change. The
department is also home to a unique interdisciplinary
Evolution Studies Program, headed by David Sloan Wil-
son. All of this makes our department a particularly
rich intellectual environment for students working at
the intersection of evolution, ecology, and genetics.18 EvolDir December 1, 2016
Binghamton University is the top-ranked institution in
the SUNY system and is consistently rated as one of the
premier public universities in the Northeast. Our cam-
pus is located in the Southern Tier of New York, between
the Catskills and Finger Lakes, about a 3 hour drive
from NYC. The region features abundant opportuni-
ties for outdoor recreation and an extremely reasonable
cost of living. Our setting on the Allegheny Plateau
isn?t just aesthetically pleasant, it also happens to be
an excellent geographic location for our study systems.
Many of our insects' host plants are locally abundant
in the upland deciduous forests and old elds in the re-
gion, and populations of the most of the members of the
Rhagoletis pomonella species complex as well as both
host races of gall ies can be found right on campus in
BU's Nature Preserve ( https://www.binghamton.edu/-

courage interested students to contact me rst. Please
send me an email at powellt@binghamton.edu, including
a letter outlining your qualications, your specic in-
terest in this position, your broader biological interests,
and your reasons for wanting to pursue a PhD as well
as a CV including your educational background, GPA,
GRE scores, publications (if any), and any relevant ex-
perience. The ocial deadline for application to the
Graduate School (including letters of recommendation)
is January 15. However, interested students will have

Life history consequences of nest site selection in birds
PhD studentship based in Hungary & the UK, 2017-2020
Supervisors: Dr A Kosztol anyi (Univ Vet Med Budapest,
Hungary), Prof Z Barta (Univ Debrecen, Hungary) and
Prof T Sz ekely (Univ Bath, UK)
Choosing nest sites is a major life history decision, sincethe location of nest inuences both the risk of predation
and the thermal properties of eggs, nest and the incubat-
ing parent. This PhD project will focus on shorebirds
that nest on the ground. Our previous research has
showed that some plovers nest in the open whereas oth-
ers nest under small bushes. However, it is not known
why these consistent individual dierences (i.e. animal
personalities) exist, how they relate to other personal-
ity traits (e.g. boldness, neophobia) and whether the
costs and benets of the dierent nesting strategies vary
under dierent climatic conditions where the plovers
breed.
The PhD student will investigate the interaction be-
tween consistency in nest site selection and climate, and
the life-history consequences of this interaction. The
student will test (i) how consistent are the individuals
in their nest site selection under hotter and milder cli-
mates, (ii) whether the nesting personality correlates
with other personality traits (e.g. bolder individuals
nests in open area), and (iii) how nest site selection
inuences reproductive success and survival.
The ideal candidate has a strong interest in evolutionary
biology, behavioural ecology and eld biology, and will-
ing to work in remote areas in Madagascar, Cape Verde
or Mexico. He/she need to have solid background in
data analyses preferably in R, and statistical modelling.
We are seeking candidates willing to raise their own
funding. Note that for students from eligible countries
the Stipendium Hungaricum oers a scholarship pro-
gramme (www.stipendiumhungaricum.hu). A condition
of the application is a Master degree (or equivalent) in
biology, zoology or similar subject.
Interested candidates should contact the lead supervisor,
Dr Andr as Kosztol anyi (Kosztolanyi.Andras@univet.hu).
Applications that include a CV (max 3 pages) and a
max 2 page cover letter with personal motivation and
the name and contact details of two references should
be sent to Dr Kosztol anyi. Deadline of application: 1
January 2017.

ButteryBehaviourEvolution
Cambridge Buttery behaviour evolution
Two PhD projects on buttery brain and behavioural
evolution are currently available in my research group
in the Dept. of Zoology, University of Cambridge:
i) Sensory adaptations in mimetic butteries Process-
ing sensory information from the environment is a vi-
tal aspect of any behavioural response. Micro-habitat
partitioning between mimicry rings in Neotropical but-
teries provides a case study in adaptation to dierent
sensory environments. Species belonging to the same
mimicry ring show convergence in micro-habitat pref-
erence, whilst distinct mimicry rings diverge in micro-
habitat preference, exposing closely related species to
contrasting sensory environments. Microhabitat prefer-
ence inuences a range of behaviours, including foraging
and intra-specic communication. This dual pattern
of convergence and divergence provides a range of op-
portunities for comparative analyses. This project will
use Ithomiine butteries as a study system to ask how
species adapt to novel sensory environments: For ex-
ample, what is more important for sensory adaptation,
changes in perception or sensory processing? How does
selection for sensory specialisation shape peripheral and
neuronal structures? Does the convergent colonisation
of the same micro-habitat produce the same evolution-
ary solutions? And how are sex-specic behaviours
shaped by variation in brain structure? The approach
taken can be tailored to the particular interests of the
student. Opportunities exist to investigate: i) molecular
evolution of sensory receptors, ii) interspecic varia-
tion in brain architecture, iii) comparative physiology
of sensory adaptations.
ii) The evolution of social caterpillars Gregarious be-
haviour has evolved many times in a wide range ofanimals. The prevalence of gregarious behaviour poses
many interesting evolutionary questions; How is the
conict between competition and cooperation balanced?
What are the advantages and what are the costs? But
it also poses many mechanistic questions; how do ani-
mals sense each other? How do they track each other's
behaviour? This project aims to tackle these ques-
tions using Heliconiini, a diverse tribe of Neotropical
butteries, as a study system. Gregarious larval be-
haviour has evolved convergent in multiple independent
lineages, and in some cases closely related species dier
dramatically in egg laying and larval behaviour. The
primary goal of the project is to understand the genetic
and behavioural mechanisms that underpin gregarious
behaviour, and to investigate the selection pressures
shaping behavioural variation across species. The ap-
proach taken can be tailored to the particular interests
of the student. Opportunities exist to investigate: i) the
behavioural mechanisms behind gregarious behaviour,
what sensory cues do they use? ii) Ecological correlates
of gregarious behaviour; why do they do it? What ef-
fects does it have on other aspects of their behaviour?
iii) Comparative genomics of convergent gregarious be-
haviour; how do changes in gene function and regulation
produce behavioural variation?

CardiU 4 EvolBiol
NERC GW4+ Doctoral Training Program - PhD in
Biosciences at Cardi University:
Is food availability and choice a limiting factor for de-
clining UK Hawnch populations?
To apply go to: http://courses.cardi.ac.uk/funding/-
R2590.html Project description: Hawnches in the UK
have declined over the past 40 years and the breeding
range has contracted to a few well-wooded locations
in western Britain. Changes in food availability are
suspected as one cause. For example, hawnches were
once pests in traditional stone fruit orchards, but such
orchards have largely disappeared. They are dispersed
foragers, specialising on the seeds of trees which are
patchy in time and space, and roost communally, which
may allow them to exchange information about the
status and location of food resources. They can move
hundreds of kilometres between seasons in relation to
variation in food availability, and have recentlybeen
found to move over a scale of several kilometres during
the breeding season.
This PhD aims to investigate whether food resources
are a limiting factor for hawnch populations in the
UK, and whether landscape-scale habitat manipulations
could be used as a conservation tool. It will characterise
the current diet of Hawnches, map the distribution of
potential food resources and investigate the interplay
between food resources and climate. The current diet in
the UK will be investigated using molecular techniques
(Next Generation Sequencing of faecal DNA)to iden-
tify both plant and invertebrate components. This will
be based on faecal samples collected by the Hawnch-
Study Network coordinated by RSPB, when they were
widespread, and also from contemporary faecal samples
from continental Europe where populations are stable.
These results will be used to identify what the key food
resources are and how this changes through the year.
The dispersed nature of dierent food sources means that
this species forages over large areas across patchy land-
scapes. Understanding how food sources are distributed,
and foraging behaviour, will be essential. RSPB is cur-
rently trialling the use of GPS tags to investigate short
term local foraging patterns. The student will createa
tree species map of the study area based on classi-
cation of remote sensing LiDAR and reectance data
to investigate the distribution and abundance of keytree species that have been shown to be exploited by
Hawnches from the diet analysis. The combination
of identication of key food resources, resource distri-
bution and behavioural foraging data can be used to
identify options for improving forest management to
benet hawnches.
Finally, the student will examine whether landscape and
climate correlates of population change could relate to
changes in abundance or fruiting of key food resources
identied. Spatially explicit estimates of change in abun-
dance between time periods is available from BTO bird
distribution atlases covering both the breeding season
and winter.
Training: The student will obtain the broad rangeof
training experience needed for modern conservation
work, integrating both lab (molecular diagnostics, bioin-
formatics, tree species mapping) and eld skills (survey
work, bird handling, faecal sampling, remote sensing),
thereby developing skills to ll gaps in the UK's research
capacity.
Associated Partners: Thestudent will collaborate with
partners at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
(RSPB) and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
(CEH), where opportunities to build new links will be
encouraged, as well as engage with the development of
skills relevant to practical conservation using cutting
edge technologies (e.g. LIDAR).

CardiU LocalAdaptation
BBSRC SWbio Doctoral Training Program - PhD in
Biosciences at Cardi University:
Unravelling local adaptation in the genome of British
sheep
To apply go to: http://courses.cardi.ac.uk/funding/-
R2865.html Project description: Understanding how
species adapt to the environment they live in is a major
goal in evolutionary biology. This is of particular value
in light of climate change, where extant species will have
to adapt to warmer and potentially harsher conditions
relatively fast. However, identifying the genomic regions
involved in local adaptation has been a challenging prob-
lem because the tools to survey species' genomes have
only become available in the last two decades, e.g. SNP
arrays and whole genome sequencing. The aim of this
project is to analyse British sheep occurring in con-
trasting environments (mountain vs. lowland) using the
OvineSNP50 arrays ( ~51,000 SNPs) to identify genetic
variation linked to local adaptation in the UK's hetero-
geneous agricultural landscape. Additionally, the SNP
arrays data will be analysed in combination with whole
genome data for a population of Iranian wild mouon
(the sheep's ancestor) and other sheep breeds in order
to identify genomic signatures of selection specic to
the domestication event.
The PhD student will be based 80% at Cardi Univer-
sity, where the research group specialises in identifying
signatures of selection using next generation sequencing
in livestock and wildlife, and 20% at Bristol Univer-
sity, a world leader in the development of statistical
approaches to study demographic history using genetic
data. For this project the PhD student will be trained insample preparation for SNP chip analysis and bioinfor-
matics analyses (e.g. data quality ltering, demographic
analyses, and identifying signatures of selection). This
experimental design will allow the PhD student to com-
pare populations of British mountain vs. lowland sheep,
in the equivalent of a replicated experiment, to identify
specic signatures of local adaptation to the environment
where these populations live in, while controlling for
confounding factors such as the demographic history (to
be simulated with approximate Bayesian computation)
and the selection signature left by the domestication
process (to be accounted for by comparing domestic
sheep against Iranian wild mouon).
Training: The student will obtain the broad range of
training experience needed for genomic analysis integrat-
ing wet lab (i.e. molecular genetics) and bioinformatics
(e.g. population modeling and selection scans), thereby
developing skills to ll a gap in the UK's research ca-
pacity.
Collaborators: The student will collaborate with part-
ners at the Parco Tecnologico Padano (Italy) who will
contribute to SNP array analysis and training.

maintenance of sexual outcrossing reproductive systems.
Surprisingly little is known about reproductive system

ETHZurich Eawag
ImmuneDefenseEvolution
A PhD student position is available in the group of
aquatic ecology at ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology Zurich) / Eawag (Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Research), Switzerland
to study natural selection on immune function at gene
expression level. Parasites present a serious threat for
natural populations of free-living species. Immune de-
fence is generally considered as an important trait in
determining organisms' tness as it eliminates harmful
parasites. Therefore, understanding the evolution of
immune defence is one of the key topics in predicting
dynamics of host-parasite interactions. However, knowl-
edge on the type and strength of selection on immune
defence traits is very limited. The goals of the project
are to assess (1) the type and strength of natural se-
lection on the expression of several immune defence
genes/pathways, (2) variation in selection imposed by
infection risk, (3) trade-os related to immune activity,
and (4) local adaptation of hosts to parasites in the
wild. The study system is a freshwater snail Lymnaea
stagnalis, and the work utilises the recently sequenced
transcriptome of this species. The work will be con-
ducted in c ollaboration with the Prof. Coen Adema
(University of New Mexico) and the Genetic Diversity
Centre at ETH (http://www.gdc.ethz.ch/).
General information about the research group can be
found at http://www.ae.ethz.ch/ We invite highly mo-tivated students with a good background in transcrip-
tomics and evolutionary ecology to apply for the position.
A MSc or equivalent degree is required. Earlier experi-
ence with the study system is not required. The project
is funded by Swiss National Science Foundation for 3
years.
Earliest starting date: February 1, 2017
Qualied persons are invited to apply by email. Please

Two phd projects (theoretical and empirical):
Oering two PhD studentships, one with a more the-
oretical focus and one with an empirical research fo-
cus, on trans-generational eects. The current speed
at which environmental conditions change is unprece-
dented, endangering vulnerable populations and species.A novel idea for how organisms can sustainably respond
to rapid environmental changes are environmentally
induced adaptations that are heritable. Such trans- gen-
erational, potentially epigenetic eects can, with high
precision mediate evolutionary rescue of populations
that experience rapidly changing environments. These
advantages put TAGs at the forefront of mechanisms
leading to adaptations to global change. These projects
will use a wild population of passerines, and experiments
in captivity, to disentangle phenotypic plasticity induced
during development from epigenetic TAGs, to better
understand the epigenetic mechanism, and evolution
of TAGs. We will use molecular analysis (telomeres,
methylation), physiology and behavioural observations
to test the hypotheses. The theoretical project will use
population modelling and individual-based simulations
infer evolutionary consequences of TAGs.
For both projects, you should have solid foundation in
quantitative biology. Experience in advanced statistical
methods using R is an advantage for both projects. The
empirical project requires a student willing to conduct
eldwork in the UK during the breeding season of each
year. A bird ringing license (BTO) is not required, but
a big advantage. Students applying for the theoretical
project should be highly quantitative and have at least
some programming experience.

LavalU GymnospermPopGenetics
One MSc position is available for a motivated student
interested in the study of population genetics of en-

at the Biology Department of Laval University (https:/-
/www.bio.ulaval.ca/accueil/) and part of the BESS
program (CREATE, https://www.mcgill.ca/bess/bess).
The project is in collaboration with colleagues of the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
Project description:
Population genomics of endangered Zamia species:
Recent estimates suggest that 65% of all cycads are
endangered (Fragniere et al. 2015, J. Biog.). Among
Neotropical countries, Panama has a high endemism
with 65% of endemic Zamia species (a total of 17 de-
scribed for the isthmus, Taylor et al. 2012). Human
development and poaching activities due to the orna-
mental value of the Isthmian Zamias are threatening
the habitats where these plants naturally occur. As
part of a long-term program to study the diversity of
Panamanian zamias and their symbionts (nitrogen-xing
bacteria and fungi) we are looking for a motivated MSc
student to study the species Zamia pseudoparasitica.
This species, endemic to Central Panama, is the only
strictly epiphytic gymnosperm and the genetic diversity
is unknown. The project consists in collecting, culturing
and genotyping populations of Zamia pseudoparasit-
ica in the country. Additionally, the student will be
contributing to the current eorts to assess endophyte
diversity, the functional genomics of the association and
their chemical diversity. Assessing multiple, sequencedgenomic regions of diverged populations of Z. pseudopar-
asitica will aid in understanding the genetic diversity
and channel eorts to pursue genetic and demographic
rescue of less diverse populations in Panama.
The successful candidate must have strong eld skills,
adaptabil ity; a background in bioinformatics is pre-
ferred. Also, it is desirable a strong background in
biology and willingness to learn French. We are looking
for an in dividual who is highly self-motivated and can
work independently. Field and most lab work will be
conducted in Panama, at STRI, while the student must
take a fe w courses (in French) at Laval University. Ad-
ditionally, the student will be wor king at the Institute
of Integrative Biology and systems of Laval University
(ht tp://www.ibis.ulaval.ca/).
To be considered, please send a single PDF le merged
from the f ollowing parts: CV including publication list,
academic transcripts, a statement of research interests
not exceeding two pages, and the name of two academic
ref erences to juan-carlos.villarreal-aguilar@bio.ulaval.ca.
The statement should i nclude the student's initiative
to obtain a fellowship for tuition. Applicatio ns will be
considered until December 15, 2016, or until the position
is lled, whichever comes rst. The position is available
from the winter or summer of 20 17.

Potential project descriptions Replaying the evolution-
ary tape: the genetics of parallel adaptation Repeated
adaptations to similar selective environments certainly
occur.
The recurrent evolution of pesticide resistance, as well
as parallel geographic patterns of owering time inva-
sive plants stand out as classic case studies. Given the
involvement of chance and the myriad of possible ways a
species could evolve, why are the phenotypic outcomes
often so consistent? Is adaptive evolution of phenotypes
to similar environments always highly repeatable, or
is our attention diverted to a biased selection of exam-
ples? Even if similar phenotypes evolve independently in
dierent geographic regions, are they as alike as they ap-
pear: could dierent genetic mechanisms be responsible
in some cases?
This project aims to gain insight into the repeatability
of local adaptation, and the genetic constraints that
may underlie this, using a set of replicated range expan-
sions along major climatic gradients. The annual plantsDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 31
Cakile maritima and Cakile edentula (both 2n) evolved
along parallel gradients of great climatic range (over
~30o of latitude) on either side of the North Atlantic in
a narrow coastal habitat. They have since undergone
human-assisted introductions and subsequent range ex-
pansions in multiple regions (e.g. western North Amer-
ica, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South America).
Thus, we can compare local adaptation during range
expansions diering in evolutionary timescales (millen-
nia for post-glacial spread in native ranges vs. decades
in their exotic ranges) in the same species as well as
between species. Moreover, each invasion arises from
unique combinations of source and recipient climates.
Adaptation is potentially ongoing, since they are still
expanding their exotic geographic ranges. These species
aord us an exciting opportunity to examine fundamen-
tal evolutionary hypotheses about the genetic basis of
adaptation outside the laboratory, in ecologically realis-
tic experimental conditions.
Reconstructing the genetics of rapid adaptation using
historic DNA Invasive species are increasingly common-
place as human activities accidentally or intentionally
move species or their propagules from place to place.
When species are rst introduced to a new location
they must often contend with new abiotic environments,
dierent species, and a lack of mates. How do intro-
duced species manage to overcome these barriers to
their survival and reproduction? In some cases species
may be genetically predisposed to thrive in their new
environment, or possess high levels of plasticity. In
other cases newly introduced populations may have to
adapt genetically to their local environments. Although
invasive species have substantial economic and environ-
mental consequences, they represent success stories for
how organisms can deal with novel environments. These
species oer an exciting avenue to address fundamen-
tal evolutionary questions, as each introduction can be
analogous to a natural experiment where adaptation to
local environments can begin anew. The species Am-
brosia artemisiifolia is a highly successful invasive species
showing strong evidence for rapid local adaptation of

Ph.D. opportunity in plant evolutionary biology Nico-
laus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland
The Chair of Ecology and Environment Protection
(http://www.keib.umk.pl/?lang=en) is recruiting two
PhD students interested in studying evolution of mor-
phological traits in plants at various time scales. The
goal of this project is to contribute towards an under-
standing of how genetic architecture (the structure of
genotype to phenotype mapping) aects the evolution of
quantitative traits. According to quantitative genetics
theory, the evolution of phenotypic traits depends on the
strength of selection and the amount of genetic variation.
However, part of this variation maybe constrained by
correlations with other traits that are under conicting
selective regimes. In consequence, the ability to respond
to selection (evolvability) may be limited, even if a trait
has high heritability. However, the extent to which ge-
netic architecture limits phenotypic evolution remains
an open question. Likewise, it is unknown whether it
aects evolution at the short time scale and is easily
overcome by selection, or if the genetic architecture is
an important long-term determinant of the direction
of evolution. In this project we aim to answer these
questions using two plant species from the family Api-
aceae, Daucus carota and Ferula communis, as a model
system. This project will be carried out in collaboration
with Prof. Thomas Hansen (University of Oslo) and dr
Krzysztof Bartoszek (Uppsala University).
PhD 1 Major tasks: - generate RADseq population data
for Ferula communis and Daucus carota - delimit in-
dependently evolving lineages in Ferula communis and
Daucus carota species complexes - determine G-matrices
for fruit and seedling traits based on molecular data
for several populations - estimate various measures of
evolvability for Ferula and Daucus system
PhD 2 Major tasks: - phylogenetic analysis of various
taxa from the family Apiaceae based on RADseq data
- establish a database of phenotypic traits (seedlings,
fruits, inorescences and owers), life history strategies
and geographic distributions for species from the family
Apiaceae - estimate the rate of morphological trait evo-
lution using phylogenetic comparative methods - help

The ideal candidate will have a background in molecular
biology/population genetics/phylogenetics, as well as ex-
perience working with Linux and modern programming
languages such as R. Previous experience in generating
and analysis of next-generation sequencing data will be
considered positively. A condition of the application
is a Master degree (or equivalent) in biology or similar
subjects.
The stipend for both positions is 3 000 PLN net monthly
(app. 700 EURO) for three years. The living cost in
Torun is low. For example, a room in a student house
(inc. Wi-Fi, kitchen, heating, hot water) is app. 100
EURO monthly, loaf of bread 0.5 EURO, beer 0.5-0.7

Queensland 2 FruitFlyGenomics
Project 1: Genetics and Genomics of Qy Sexual Per-
formance Closing Date: Expressions of interest close at
midnight on Friday 20 January 2017
A PhD opportunity is available on a project investigat-
ing the genetics and genomics of sexual performance in
the Queensland fruit y (Qy; Bactrocera tryoni). This
project is part of a signicant collaboration between Drs
John Oakeshott and Ronald Lee at Australia's Com-
monwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organ-
isation (CSIRO) and Prof Phil Taylor at Macquarie
University's Department of Biological Sciences (http://-bio.mq.edu.au/).
Sexual performance is key to Darwinian tness. In some
insect systems the key elements of sexual performance
(e.g. pheromonal communication, courtship rituals) ex-
hibit strong genetic inuences. However, the genetic
factors governing sexual performance in Qy are yet to
be discovered. The emergence of powerful ^ atechnologies
has vastly advanced the scope and depth of mating
system research, and the recent development and de-
ployment of such tools for Qies enables unprecedented
opportunities for investigation of traits underpinning
sexual performance in this species.
The approaches and methods will be highly multi-
disciplinary. The PhD candidate will combine bioassays
to measure reproductive behaviours with state-of-the-
art genomic, proteomic and metabolomic technologies to
understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms
underpinning male mating success. Traits of potential
interest include pheromone synthesis and composition,
calling behaviour, reproductive eort and sperm transfer.
Strains from a wide variety of locations and with dier-
ent histories of domestication (which inevitably impose
dierent selection pressures on reproductive behaviour)
are already available for study.
In addition to being of fundamental interest, knowledge
gained in this PhD project will contribute to environmen-
tally sustainable pest management through the Sterile
Insect Technique (SIT). In SIT millions of mass-reared
sterile male ies are released to mate with wild females
and induce reproductive failure through the transfer of
sterile sperm and induction of sexual inhibition. For
SIT programs to succeed, the released male ies must
be sexually competitive. Knowledge gained in this PhD
will later assist in the development of eld-competitive
strains for use in in SIT control programs.
The project will be based mainly at the Commonwealth
Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)
in Canberra but with signicant involvement also from
Macquarie University in Sydney. The two laboratories
provide an ideal environment for this research; both
have invested heavily in the infrastructure necessary for
Qy research and have deep experience in Q-y biology,
molecular and quantitative genetics and the various ^ a'
technologies that will underpin this research. Numerous
PhD students and Research Fellows are already working
in the two laboratories on diverse aspects of Qy biology,
genetics and genomics, providing an exciting learning
environment and an opportunity to contribute meaning-
fully to an environmentally sustainable new technology
for controlling a major horticultural pest.
The value and tenure of the scholarship is: - $30,849 pa
(2016 rate, subject to annual indexation, tax free) forDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 37
3 years. This includes a stipend of $25,849 pa plus a
scholarship ^ aup' of $5,000 pa.
- For International candidates, scholarships will also
cover all tuition fees.
To be eligible for a scholarship, applicants are expected
to have a record of excellent academic performance
and preferably, additional relevant research experience
and/or peer-reviewed research activity, awards and/or
prizes in line with the University's scholarship rating
guidelines. Refer to the Rating Scholarship Applicants
section for more information about these guidelines.
Students on scholarships are not obliged to contribute
to teaching, but may do so to supplement their income
if desired. In addition to substantial nancial resources
to draw on for research, several generous schemes are
available to fund travel to visit overseas laboratories or
to attend overseas conferences.
Interested applicants should email a letter of interest,
academic transcripts, curriculum vitae and the names
and contact information of three referees to Dr John
Oakeshott (john.oakeshott@csiro.au).

NeotropicalOrnithology
Please visit this announcement at: https://-
mjmillerlab.github.io/blog/recruit I am recruiting
1-2 PhD students to join my lab in the Ornithology
Department of the Sam Noble Museum at University of
Oklahoma for the Fall 2017. Students should be willing
to take a creative leadership role in the comparative
genomics of secondary contact and speciation in
Neotropical birds. These positions would involve
considerable time in the eld on expeditions in Latin
America to collect birds, supported by the Sam Noble
Oklahoma Museum Department of Ornithology.
The ideal student will have previous Latin American
ornithological eld experience, as well as the ability to
understand and speak Spanish. Students from Latin
America are particularly encouraged to apply. These
projects will consist of developing genomic datasets
from massively-parallel sequencing eorts (i.e. next
gene sequencing) at the University of Oklahoma. Strong
computational skills in UNIX, R and Python are a real
plus. However, all potential students with strong eld,
lab, and museum ornithological skills are encouraged to38 EvolDir December 1, 2016
contact me.
Students can undertake projects in two areas where
we have existing datasets: either in the comparative
genomics of secondary contact of lowlands birds (see
Secondary Contact Project) or in the genomics of species
isolation of Lampornis hummingbirds (see Lampornis
Genomics Project), or the student can develop her/his
own project. We have active funding for eld research in
Bolivia and Peru as well, so projects in this area could
be developed.
Students in our lab are enrolled in either the Biology
or closely allied Ecology and Evolutionary Biology PhD
program, but maintain oces and a lab home in the
Ornithology Department at the Sam Noble Oklahoma
Museum of Natural History. The Ornithology Depart-
ment consists of a fast-growing ornithological collection,
state-of-the-art molecular genomics labs (capable of do-
ing all NGS preparations including ddRAD-Seq, hybrid
capture, and whole genome sequencing), multiple bioin-
formatics Linux workstations (as well as access to the
OU Supercomputer), and an impressive ornithological
research library.
OU Biology/EEB has a strong focus on \geographical
ecology", and our group participates in the Geographi-
cal Ecology working group, which is organized by Mike
Kaspari (tropical community ecology), and includes the
following faculty: Katie Marske (phylogeography) Katie
Marshall (physiological ecology), Dan Allen (stream
and riparian ecology) and Cam Siler (herpetology and
systematics). Collectively, our group provides a rich
environment for students to interact with these and
other talented faculty and students in the Geographi-
cal Ecology working group and throughout the Biology
department.
We are also allied with the Oklahoma Biological Survey,
which has considerable strengths in ornithology. This
includes Je Kelly's lab, Eli Bridge's group, and Jeremy
Ross's lab. Collectively, this makes OU among the best
universities for ornithology in the country.
Funding for graduate students is currently available
in the form of 10-month teaching assistantships with
reasonable stipends, full tuition waivers and excellent
health care coverage. In addition, students can expect
to be funded during the summer by the OU Sutton
Avian Research Scholarships, Adams Scholarships, and
Curatorial Assistantships in Ornithology at the Sam
Noble Museum. Our lab has existing funds for eld ex-
peditions and specimen collection, and there are several
funding sources on campus and elsewhere for the devel-
opment of next-generation genomic datasets. Norman is
an amazing college town, and the cost of living is quite
reasonable for graduate students.Interested students should contact me
(mjmiller@ou.edu) with a brief summary of your
research interests and relevant experiences and attach a
CV. All prospective students must also apply through
the OU Biology Graduate Program by mid December.

We are seeking highly motivated PhD candi-

<https://obrasociallacaixa.org/en/educacion-becas/-
becas-de-posgrado/inphinit/programme-description >
fellowship (3-year contract, gross salary 34 800 /year)
to develop the PhD project \*Integrating genomic and
ecological data to infer community-level responses to
past and ongoing global change*" (see details below).
The PhD will be developed under the supervision of
Dr. Joaqu n Ortego <https://sites.google.com/site/-
joaquinortegolozano/ >at Estaci on Biol ogica de Do nana
(EBD-CSIC, Seville, Spain), a reference center for eco-
logical and evolutionary research.
*Research project description*: Understanding how dif-
ferent organisms interact with landscape heterogeneity
and environmental uctuations is central to infer their
future responses to global change. Most studies have ad-
dressed these questions focusing on a single or a few taxa,
a fact that has strongly limited our ability to predict
how entire-communities/ecosystems will be impacted
by dierent sources of human-induced environmental al-
terations. This takes more relevance if we consider that
assemblages of co-distributed species (i.e. sharing a com-
mon geographic space) are often composed by taxa with
very contrasting life-history traits (e.g. dispersal capac-
ity, phenology, climatic tolerances, etc.) and, thus, they
are expected to respond to ongoing global change in very
dierent ways. This research project will focus on the
study of several co-distributed or partially co-distributed
grasshopper species occupying dierent climatic niches
(montane *versus* alpine species) and showing remark-
able dierences in dispersal capacity (ightless taxa
*versus* good dispersers), degree of ecological special-
ization (habitat specialists *versus* generalists) and
distribution ranges (widely distributed taxa *versus*
narrow endemics). The project will be developed in
the Pyrenees Mountains, an area which oers a superb
template to address the above described questions due
to its step environmental gradients, rough topography,
and considerable impacts of past and ongoing climate
change on the demographic and evolutionary history of
the rich biota from the region.
*Job position description:* The PhD project will behighly multidisciplinary, requiring the integration of
eld sampling campaigns, molecular lab work, and sev-
eral analytical approaches. The main tasks will include:
1) Intensive eld-work campaigns (1-2 months/year)
in the Pyrenees Mountains to get samples and ecologi-
cal/distributional data; 2) Molecular lab work to prepare
genomic libraries for high-throughput sequencing (us-
ing double-digest RadSeq); 3) Obtaining phenotypic
information from collected specimens using linear and
geometric morphometric analyses; 4) Ecological and
climatic niche modeling of the studied species and lin-
eages; 5) Bioinformatic treatment of genomic data; 6)
Integration of genomic, phenotypic and ecological data
to infer past and future responses of the studied taxa
to landscape heterogeneity and environmental changes.
The PhD student will also have access to the large en-
tomological wet collection available in our lab ( >10000
ethanol-preserved specimens). Previous experience with
molecular lab work, bioinformatics, genetic data treat-
ment, and/or geographic information systems are wel-
come but not necessary, as all the skills required to
develop the PhD project will be acquired at our lab. At
the end of the PhD the student will have an extraordi-
nary multidisciplinary training on the state-of-the-art of
a suite of analytical techniques and methodological ap-
proaches, placing him/her at the forefront of research on
evolutionary biogeography and conservation genomics.

the dynamic movement of sex determination regions and
sex chromosome evolution within the Salicaceae (poplars
and willows). The overall project focuses on mapping sex
determination regions from representatives Populus and
Salix species, understanding the genetic basis of gender
dimorphism in defense and pollinator attraction chem-
istry, and the assessment of population genetic patterns
across the sex determination and pseudo-autosomal re-
gions of the sex chromosomes. Graduate students work-
ing on this project will have the opportunity to choose
from a variety of projects including, but not limited
to, mapping the locations of previously unknown sex
determination regions, development of phylogenies forimportant plant groups, and studying the ecology and
evolution of sexual dimorphism in plant defensive and
pollinator attraction compounds. Moreover, the grant
provides for a unique multi-institutional and interna-
tional training environment, with potential funding to
visit labs at the University of West Virginia, the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, Cornell University, and Sichuan
University and Nanjing Forestry University in China for

EvolutionParasiteTraits
The Evolutionary Ecology Group has a vacancy for a
PhD student in a project on \Evolutionary potential
of parasite traits in a bird-tick system". Host-parasite
interactions are considered among the most dynamic
co-evolutionary processes, as host and parasite exert
mutual selective pressures leading to a chain of adap-
tations and counter-adaptations. To understand this
process, a key element is the quantication of heritable
individual variation and selection pressures in both host
and parasite. This PhD project uses an experimental
bird-tick system where hosts have a high degree of toler-44 EvolDir December 1, 2016
ance (i.e. minimal harm) towards a specialized parasite.
In this system we will explore how parasite traits are
shaped by natural selection through the study of ge-
netic variation, trade-os among traits, and selection
pressures related to the host and the environment. Indi-
vidual ticks will be followed across multiple generation
in a strict breeding design, combined with controlled
infestations of hosts in the lab and in the eld. Us-
ing hosts with a known pedigree further allows us to
bring in their phenotypic and genetic background as
well. Thus, aside from eld and lab work the project
also involves a strong modelling component for pedigree
and tness analyses. We have ten years of experience
with this study system providing a solid basis for a suc-
cessful project. Prole and requirements: You hold a
Master degree in Biology or comparable with a strong
background in ecology and evolutionary biology; You
can submit outstanding academic results; You have a
solid training in both uni- and multivariate statistical
analysis; Experience with parasite research, bird ringing
and handling, and/or quantitative genetics is an advan-
tage. We oer: A doctoral scholarship for a period of
two years, with the possibility of renewal for a further
two-year period after positive evaluation; The starting
date of the scholarship will be February 1st 2017; You
will enrol in the Antwerp Doctoral School training pro-
gram (www.uantwerpen.be/ads) allowing you to take
part in various courses, training programs and confer-
ences within and outside the university; You will work
in a team of several PhD students, postdocs and techni-

dian and American partners.
The project's primary goal is to develop an integrated
ecosystem-based approach for the preservation and sus-
tainable exploitation of deep-sea sponge ecosystems of
the North Atlantic, which requires a deep understand-
ing of their diversity, evolutionary and connectivity pat-
terns.
Phylogenetic and population-level studies performed in
sponges have been in most part restricted to shallow-
water species, and relatively limited in terms of the
nature and number of markers used. In SponGES we
will employ a genomic-based approach to investigate
the phylogenetic relationships, biogeographic patterns
as well as genetic diversity, structure and connectivity
of several deep-sea grounds-forming species at dierentspatial scales.
The candidate will be based at the University of Bergen
and enrolled in its PhD programme but have several
research stays in the Natural History Museum London
(Ana Riesgo's lab), and will further collaborate with
researchers from the University of Uppsala (Sweden)
and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Canada).
*The activities will entail:*
participation in sampling cruises to several case study
areas.
development of a suite of genomic resources (e.g. single
nucleotide polymorphisms, full mitochondrial genomes)
of key structuring species, using next-generation se-
quencing technologies (NGS).
assessment of the evolutionary, phylogeographic and con-
nectivity patterns of species and populations at various
spatial scales.
publishing of scientic work
*Qualications and personal qualities:*
The applicant must hold a master's degree or the equiv-
alent in marine and/or molecular ecology/biology (or
similar), or must have submitted his/her master's thesis
for assessment prior to the application deadline. It is a
condition of employment that the master's degree has
been awarded.

within the mammalian microbiome; 2) ecological impact
co-evolved commensal eukaryotes have on the immune
system and gut microbiota in a rat model system; 3) di-
versity and host-specicity of microbes associated with
seaweeds, 4) using the eukaryotic tree of life to make
sense of the multitudes of unknown eukaryotes coming
from environmental sequencing (eukref.org). The PhD
student will have the opportunity to develop his or her
own research projects within these topics.
Strong candidates will have a successful track recordof conducting research in evolution, ecology, microbiol-

PhD Graduate Student Position: \A genomic approach
to detect, monitor and track the emergence of an-
thelmintic drug resistance in Human Soil Transmitted
Helminths (STH)".
The University of Calgary, Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine (UCVM is seeking a graduate student for
a project using genomics approaches to investigate drug
resistance in human soil transmitted helminths. The
project will apply johnseveral deep amplicon sequencing
and genome-wide scanning approaches that we have de-
veloped for animal parasites and apply them to track the
emergence of benzimidazole drug resistance in human
soil transmitted helminths.
What are we looking for an individual with a background
in molecular ecology and/or population genomics and
bioinformatics skills (or a keen desire and aptitude to48 EvolDir December 1, 2016
learn) with a strong interest in applying their skills to
a major human health problem in the developing world.
The balance of specic expertise will be considered on
a case-by-case basis. The preferred candidate needs to
be highly motivated, enthusiastic and good team player
with excellent communication skills. The work will be
predominantly laboratory based but will involve working
with collaborators in endemic regions with the potential
fro some eld work for the appropriate candidate.
The Project: There are currently 1.5 billion people in-
fected worldwide with soil-transmitted helminths; round-
worms such as Ascaris, Trichuris and Hookworms. The
World Health Organization is currently undertaking the
largest mass drug administration (MDA) program in
human history to control these important pathogens.
This program is dependent on a single drug class (benz-
imidazoles such as albendazole and mebendazole) and
there is now major concern about the emergence of drug
resistance. This PhD project will undertake a num-
ber of genomic approaches to detect and monitor the
emergence of drug resistance in communities undergoing
mass drug administration programs in endemic regions
(including Ethiopia, Tanzania and Brazil).
What we oer: The graduate student will be co-
supervised by Dr John Gilleard, Professor of Parasitol-
ogy (http://www.ucalgary.ca/jsgilleard/ ) and Dr Sam

They will be part of a large interdisciplinary research
group focussed on the study of anthelmintic drug re-
sistance in parasites. The graduate student will also
be a member of the NSERC-CREATE Host-parasite
Interactions (HPI) graduate program which oers out-
standing opportunities to undertake professional devel-
opment and community outreach activities (see http://-

Prof. John Huelsenbeck (Dept. of Integrative Biology,
University of California, Berkeley)
The bacterial metabolisms of photosynthesis and nitro-
gen xation have shaped life on our planet by contribut-
ing to the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the Earth's
biosphere. While photosynthesis xes carbon dioxide
using dierent electron donors into carbohydrates, ni-
trogen xation transforms atmospheric nitrogen into a
bioavailable source such as ammonium. Geochemical
and biological evidence suggests that photosynthesis
(1-3) and nitrogen xation (4,5) evolved shortly after
life originated on our planet. Understanding how these
metabolisms evolved through the bacterial domain will
give insights into how these processes have shaped bio-
geochemical cycles. How can we study the evolution
of photosynthesis and nitrogen xation given that they
evolved billions of years ago? The evolution of these
processes must be studied indirectly, through the phy-
logenetic comparison of a wide diversity of bacterial
lineages. Such an analysis can help elucidate the details
of how these processes evolved and when they evolved.
Lateral gene transfer the transmission of genes between
dierent bacterial lineages has been used to explain the
current distribution of these metabolisms on the bacte-
rial tree of life. Alternative explanations might also be
possible, such as the dierential loss of genes involved
in these metabolisms as bacterial lineages diversied.December 1, 2016 EvolDir 49
Using the bacterial tree of life, this project aims to
study how and when these fundamental metabolisms
evolve. We will use large genomic data sets to study:
(1) the evolution of the bacterial linages and (2) the
evolutionary patterns for photosynthesis and nitrogen
xation (both vertical and horizontal) across bacterial
groups. The Ph.D. student funded by this grant will
also have the unique opportunity to not only collect the
appropriate data but also to develop new phylogenetic
methods.
This student would be co-advised by Dr. Patricia
S anchez-Baracaldo (University of Bristol) who is an
expert in the biological/geological data and Prof. John
Huelsenbeck (University of California, Berkeley) who is
an expert in the development of phylogenetic methods.
This is a great opportunity for students interested in evo-
lutionary biology, phylogenetic methods, bioinformatics,
and the origin of life.
This is a four-year project funded by the University of
Bristol (the host institution) with a stipend of 14,296 +
fees for UK and EU students.

JumpingSpiderEvolution
Hiall,
Iam recruiting two PhD students to join my research
group at the University of Cincinnati in the summer or
fall of 2017. I am particularly interested in recruiting
new students to join our research on the coevolution of
jumping spider color vision and coloration.
Oneavailable PhD position, funded through an active
NSF grant, will investigate the role of female visual
attention/gaze in driving the evolution of complex male
displays in the North American jumping spider genus
Habronattus. This research project combines inten-
sive eld work with lab-based video characterization
of male displays and eye-tracking of female gaze re-
sponses to video playback of displaying males (the latter
in collaboration with Beth Jakob at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst).
Thesecond doctoral position will support a new research
initiative in my group to understand the repeated evo-
lution of color vision across jumping spiders. Thus far,
we have identied two independent and functionally dis-
tinct transitions from dichromacy to tri-/tetrachromacy
in jumping spiders, which are, not surprisingly, tightly
associated with rapid diversication of male color orna-
mentation. We are now interested in identifying any ad-
ditional evolutionary transitions in color vision, charac-
terizing when and why they occurred, and investigating
their \downstream" consequences for biodiversity in this
group of animals. This work will leverage international
eld work with molecular, microspectrophotometric, and
hyperspectral imaging approaches.
Inaddition to these new research initiatives, we have
a number of other research projects that could pro-50 EvolDir December 1, 2016

PlantComputationalGenomics
The Plant Computational Genomics lab in the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the Uni-
versity of Connecticut seeks motivated PhD and MS
students to join the lab in the Summer/Fall 2017. Our re-
search focuses on the computational analysis of genomic
and transcriptomic data generated by next-generation
sequencing platforms from non-model forest tree species.
We implement this through analysis related to gene
nding, gene expression, transcriptome assembly, and
conserved element identication, through machine learn-
ing and computational statistics. We use these methods
to address questions related to genome biology and pop-
ulation genomics. In addition, we develop web-based
applications that integrate BIG data across domains
to facilitate the forest geneticist or ecologist's ability
to analyze, share, and visualize their data ( http://-
treegenesdb.org). Such integration requires the imple-
mentation of semantic technologies and ontologies to
connect genotype, phenotype, and environmental re-
sources.
RESEARCH TOPICS:
Potential research topics in our group include 1) devel-
opment of visualization tools to support genome-wide
association studies in forest trees; 2) application of ge-
nomic and transcriptomic techniques to evaluate the
impact of climate change on tree populations; 3) devel-
opment of software solutions to improve assembly and
characterization of non-model plant transcriptomes; 4)
interrogation of natural genetic variation across popu-
lations in large, complex conifer genomes; 5) and your
ideas here!

ExptEvolOfReproductiveIsolation
PhD available for Oct 2017 start.
Experimental evolution of reproductive isolation PI:
Tracey Chapman, School of Biological Sciences, Univer-
sity of East Anglia, UK Co-Is: Wilfried Haerty, Will
Nash, Earlham Institute, Irina Mohorianu, UEA.
Deadline: Jan 8th 2017 The PhD project oers a unique
training opportunity to apply novel genetic manipula-
tions and bioinformatics analysis to reveal key mecha-
nisms underlying the evolution of reproductive isolation
(RI).
Background The PhD project represents an exciting
prospect to investigate the mechanisms underlying Re-
productive Isolation (RI) in a global agricultural pest
(the medy, Ceratitis capitata). The student will utilise
a unique, long-term evolution experiment in which we
have described nascent RI. In this novel project, they
will probe the underlying mechanisms involved and test
the eect of silencing candidate loci identied from ex-isting transcriptomic data and from new genome scans.
They will also prole the expression changes in coding
and non-coding transcripts underlying early divergence,
to gain much needed insight into the trajectory of early
adaptation. The student will benet signicantly from
the training they gain from the thriving ENVEast Doc-
toral Training Partnership. They will also gain highly
sought after, transferrable research skills training in ge-
netic manipulations and novel population genetics and
bioinformatics analyses of high throughput coding and
gene expression data.
Objectives 1. Identifying genes involved in maintaining
RI.
Double stranded (ds)RNA gene silencing of candidate
loci and tests of altered mating patterns.
2. Proling the nature of early divergence (i) Analysis of
existing transcriptome data to construct gene regulatory
networks (GRNs).
(ii) Tracking the genomic and transcriptomic proles of
early divergence.
Training In addition to excellent training in advanced
and generic PhD training skills provided by the EnvEast
NERC DTP, the student will gain specic research skills
in practical genetic / genomic manipulations and in
bioinformatics - all of which are in high demand. We
have a highly collaborative research ethos and well-
equipped insect and molecular labs, spacious CT rooms,
wash up, media preparation and dedicated server. The
student will attend an EU-wide student-focussed confer-
ence, an international conference and national meetings.
The student will conduct all the research work and anal-
ysis and will increasingly direct the research programme
as they progress.
This is a challenging and interdisciplinary project and
would suit an ambitious student with a good Honours
degree in biological sciences / genetics with a willingness
to learn programming.
Funding Notes
This project has been shortlisted for funding by the En-
vEast NERC Doctoral Training Partnership, comprising
the Universities of East Anglia, Essex and Kent, with
twenty other research partners.
Shortlisted applicants will be interviewed on 14/15
February 2017.
Successful candidates who meet RCUK's eligibility crite-
ria will be awarded a NERC studentship. In most cases,
UK and EU nationals who have been resident in the

The soup in my y: mechanisms of reproductive plas-
ticity
PI: Tracey Chapman, School of Biological Sciences, Uni-
versity of East Anglia, UK Co-Is: Clive Wilson (Oxford),
Matthew Gage, Irina Mohorianu (UEA), Amanda Bret-
man (Leeds). Deadline: 28th Nov 2016
This PhD project oers a unique training opportunity
to understand how male fruities respond to their social
and sexual environment. The student will gain research
skills in cutting-edge genetic, genomic manipulations,
bioinformatics and cellular microscopy. They will re-
ceive excellent training and career development from the
thriving Norwich Biosciences Doctoral Training Part-
nership and from the collaboration with Professor Clive
Wilson at the University of Oxford.
An important part of being successful and competitive
is to respond to the rapidly changing environments in
which we often nd ourselves. A familiar example is
'speech accommodation', where individuals, often unin-
tentionally, adopt the accent or speech patterns of those
around them. Fruity males have adopted this principle
and are able to show highly precise responses to their
social and sexual environment. Following detection of
conspecic rivals, males transfer more ejaculate proteins
to females and sire more ospring. They are even able
to alter the composition of the ejaculate 'soup' that they
transfer. Males can switch their 'rivals responses' on
and o with great accuracy and speed.
The overarching aim is to nd out how males can do this.
Our recent studies support the hypothesis that males
can potentially use dierent mechanisms, to turn genes
on / o, remove inhibitors of gene expression and change
the way that ejaculate proteins are made and expelled.
The student will test this and determine the temporal
sequence of events. They will use phenotypic proling
to assess the eect of genetic manipulations of accessoryglands, measure changes to gene and non-coding RNA
expression using bioinformatics, and prole structural
and signaling changes using high resolution microscopy.

EvolutionPlantDispersion
As fruits or pollen, plants can y over a long distance
without any muscles; a great example is the dande-
lion fruit, which is thought to be able to travel over
miles by air. The dandelion fruit is only one example
of many lamentous ying fruits found in the Aster-
aceae family, and their morphologies are variations on
a common theme. With this PhD research you will
resolve the evolutionary origins of key morphological
and other design features that enhance the ight ca-
pacity of the lamentous ying fruits. In so doing, you
will examine the development of these unique fruits and
identify the developmental regulators of the evolution-
ary innovations. The project is highly interdisciplinary
and integrates ecology with evolutionary developmental
biology, together with functional analyses of specic
morphological features using ight assays in the lab and
the eld. A candidate with immense curiosity about
evolutions of biological forms and their functions are
encouraged to consider this project. For more informa-

infectious diseases in pollinator communities
Honeybees and bumblebees are key pollinators of wild
and agricultural owering plants. Recently, it has be-
come clear that these insects not only overlap in their
ecology, but also share many infectious diseases (Fuerst
et al. 2014, Manley et al. 2015), which can spread
globally (Wilfert et al. 2016). This makes pollinators an
excellent ecological model system for emerging diseases,
but also potentially impacts how pollinators have to
be managed and conserved. In this project, you will
be able to study the ecological and evolutionary risk
factors driving disease emergence and spread, as well as
their impacts on pollinator communities at an ecologi-
cal and evolutionary level. You will be part of a large
collaborative inter-disciplinary research project study-
ing the impacts of agri-environment schemes, designed
to improve agricultural landscapes for pollinators, on
emerging diseases in pollinators.
In this PhD, you will be trained in experimental ecology
in the eld and the lab and gain skills in molecular
ecology, population genetics and phylogenetics. With
your PhD, you will be able to address both fundamen-
tal questions on the evolutionary ecology of multi-host
pathogen interactions, as well on the applied impacts of
these interactions and how they can be mitigated. You
will be primarily based at the University of Exeter's
Penryn campus, but also spend time at NERC's Centre
for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in Oxfordshire.

UExeter ShrimpVirusEvolution
White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is a well-studied
crustacean virus and has devastating eects on the
shrimp farming industry, causing cumulative losses ex-
ceeding $10bn since 1993 (Stentiford et al., 2012). Com-
bating this globally important pathogen is a high prior-
ity worldwide to promote food security and sustainable
food production and to protect the health of wild crus-
tacean species in tropical and temperate areas aected
by WSSV. WSSV emerged in 1991 in Penaeus japoni-
cus in China and Taipei, spreading rapidly throughout
Asia and the Americas. WSSV is a large dsDNA virus
and currently the sole member of the virus family Ni-
maviridae. Recently, we have isolated a similar virus
in wild-caught European shore crab Carcinus maenas
and previous studies have also suggested the presence of
WSSV-like viruses in other crustaceans. Viral diseases
occur in both farmed and wild aquatic animals, and
these diseases commonly have their natural reservoir
in wild aquatic animals, where population densities are
often not sucient to sustain the natural transmission
cycle, which is readily facilitated by aquaculture. To
prevent the emergence of novel diseases and to con-
trol WSSV, we therefore need to understand the viralDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 55
epidemiology of wild and farmed crustaceans.
In this project, you will investigate the epidemiology
and evolution of viruses in wild and farmed crustaceans
in order to better understand the emergence of novel
diseases and potentially inform mitigation strategies
and therapeutic treatments. You will be part of a large
interdisciplinary team and receive training in bioinfor-
matics, evolutionary genetics and experimental and eco-
logical epidemiology in order to identify ancestral hosts
of WSSV-like viruses and reconstruct their epidemiology
using phylogenetic models.
Using the latest molecular tools, you will analyse high-
throughput sequencing datasets derived from existing
tissue collections from wild portunid crabs sampled from
shrimp farming regions (such as mangrove areas sur-
rounding shrimp ponds in Thailand) to identify WSSV-
like viruses with the potential to cause emerging diseases.
Furthermore, you will experimentally test for variation
in host susceptibility and aim to identify the genetic
basis for variation in resistance with the ultimate aim to
provide tools for the prevention, mitigation and treat-
ment of WSSV and other novel emerging diseases in
farmed crustaceans.
The project will be supervised by Dr Kelly Bateman and
Dr Ronny van Aerle (Cefas), Dr Lena Wilfert (University
of Exeter) and Dr Kallaya Sritunyalucksana-Dangtip
(Centex Shrimp, Thailand). The student will be pri-
marily based at Cefas (Weymouth), but will also spend
time at the University of Exeter (Penryn Campus), ben-
eting from high-quality research environments and the
interface between research and its application to policy.

UFlorida SexualSelection
I am looking to recruit graduate students to study (1)
the evolutionary interplay of behavior and morphology
and (2) the functional morphology of insect weapons.
These positions include stipend and tuition, they begin
Fall 2017, and they are located at the University of
Florida.
Our research focuses on sexual selection in insects, ex-
amining the importance of environmental variability
both for the expression of sexually-selected traits and
for the process of selection itself. We primarily work on
leaf-footed bugs, Family Coreidae. These insects wrestle
with their hind legs over territories and have a diverse
assemblage of hind leg shapes. Ongoing projects in the
lab include studies of context-dependent mate choice
and male-male competition, testes-weapon trade-os,
and the evolution of allometry. We are currently recon-
structing a phylogeny of the group to test hypotheses
of weapon shape evolution.

Department of Biology
University of Ghent, Belgium
http://users.ugent.be/ ~mshawkey Deadline: February
10, 2017
A fully-funded 4-year PhD position over the broad theme
of how coloration aects thermal properties of integu-
ment is available in the Evolution and Optics of Nanos-
tructures (EON) group at the University of Ghent, Bel-
gium. Most studies on the colors of animal integument
have focused on their roles in camouage or sexual
signaling, but they can also have signicant thermal ef-
fects. We propose to quantify these thermal eects and
determine how nanostructuring that produces bright,
iridescent colors aects them. This research will help
elucidate evolution of animal coloration and may inspire
the design of novel multifunctional materials. Although
we primarily work on birds, the study system is open
to the student's interest. The student will likely learn
and use electron and light microscopy, chemical analyses
(Raman and mass spectrometry, etc.), spectrophotome-
try, phylogenetic and/or optical modeling and eldwork.
We encourage anyone with an interest in multidisci-
plinary research to apply, including those trained in
elds outside biology.
Funding: Four years of funding, including tuition and
tax-free yearly stipend of ~euro23,800 (with annual
increases) are guaranteed. Research expenditures of
euro8,900/ year are also provided to the student.
Eligibility: Open to all nationalities. A Bachelor's de-
gree in any eld of science (preferably Biology, Physics or
Materials Science) is required by the time of admission.
Further postgraduate education (e.g. M.Sc.) and/or
experience with scientic research will be advantageous.
Prociency with the English language (both written
and spoken) is required, and basic skills in Dutch (or a
willingness to learn) are advantageous.

tics in Birds: how to overcome a Ru handicap
How does behavioural diversity persist over time? The
Ru Philomachus pugnax is a charismatic shorebird
with multiple male mating tactics that profoundly dier
in display behaviour, aggression and male ornamental
plumage. The dierences are best visible in males dur-
ing the breeding season where three morphs can be
identied: (i) Independents, large aggressive Rus with
dark plumage ornaments, who ght other Independents
over matings with females; (ii) Satellites, non-aggressive
Rus with pale plumage ornaments that co-display with
Independents and (iii) Faeders, small non-aggressive
Rus who lack plumage ornaments and actively dis-
tract ornamented males from matings whilst stealthily
attempting to steal matings with females themselves.
Remarkably, these reproductive tactics are fully geneti-
cally determined and the three morphs appear to occurDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 59
in stable frequencies in nature.
We recently found that the underlying genetic dier-
ences are entirely encapsulated within a chromosomal
inversion region on chromosome 11. This region com-
prises less than 0.5% of the Ru genome. This inversion
variant is homozygous lethal since one breakpoint in-
terrupts the gene CENPN, whose product is required
during mitosis. In addition, long time data from aviary
breeding suggest that carrying an inversion allele in-
creases juvenile mortality and therefore the inversion
provides a genetic handicap. Our detailed knowledge
about the genomic dierences has made it possible to
develop new diagnostic tools to determine morph fre-
quencies in nature that we want to use to advance our
understanding about the persistence of this unusual
behavioural diversity and illuminate how the genetic
handicap is compensated for.
Your prole: We are seeking a PhD candidate who will
take a demographic modeling approach to help us un-
derstanding, how the three morphs co-exist in nature.
The project will provide opportunities to do eldwork
and sample Rus in dierent parts of Europe, carry
out moleculargenetic work (SNP genotyping) and ad-
vanced demographic modeling. The student will then
integrate already collected data from captivity and the
wild with newly collected data and construct a series
of state-of-the-art population-matrix models. These
models will provide critical morph- and sex-specic pa-
rameter estimates, which as such cannot be obtained
otherwise. The insights from the modelling will advance
our understanding about the maintenance of phenotypic
diversity in a textbook example for sexual selection. It
will complement other research currently carried out
in our group aiming to unravel the proximate mecha-
nisms underlying the three morphs. Applicants should
hold a MSc or equivalent degree in biology or a related
discipline at the point of enrollment.

hormonal traits.
Our goal is to unravel evolutionary patterns in exible
physiological traits such as circulating hormone con-
centrations. Unlike stable traits like morphology, the
evolution of highly exible traits like hormones is still
hardly understood. Since hormones regulate a wide
range of tness-relevant traits, it is important to un-
derstand their scope for plastic or micro-evolutionary
changes to understand the potential of populations to
adapt to the rapid ongoing changes in environmental
conditions world-wide. We are currently focusing on
the ^ a' hormone corticosterone, assessing circulating con-
centrations as well as responses to environmental and
social conditions in wild populations of great tits (Parus
major). We are assembling a growing data base of hor-
mone concentrations of individuals taken at multiple
times of year, together with measures of tness and
genetic pedigree. We routinely collect correlative data
on hormone variation relative to environmental and
social variation and have embarked on experimental
approaches to establish hormonal reaction norms.
Your prole: We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD
candidate to continue and expand the eld and data
base work to quantify the plasticity and heritability of
corticosterone traits. We welcome the use of experi-
mental approaches such as reaction norms to quantify
hormonal responses of individuals. We are also able to60 EvolDir December 1, 2016

Project: Gene copy number variation and recent human
evolution
Background: Over the past 60,000 years, modern hu-
mans have dispersed from Africa into the rest of theDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 61
world. In the process, humans have adapted to new envi-
ronments both culturally and genetically. Subsequently,
humans have altered the environment themselves, with
the development of species domestication, agriculture
and spread of urbanisation.
The role of natural selection in recent human evolution
remains unclear. There are some well-founded examples,
where there is strong genetic evidence for natural selec-
tion, a molecular basis for the phenotypic change, and
a convincing adaptive evolutionary explanation for the
phenotype. An example is the lactase persistence allele
enabling digestion of lactose in milk as an adult. Another
example is the sickle-cell haemoglobin allele, which is at
higher frequencies in populations with endemic malaria
because of the protection it confers against severe malar-
ial symptoms. However, such well-validated examples
are few.
Because of the recent timescales involved in recent hu-
man evolution, it has been argued that subtle changes
in allele frequency at multiple loci mediate adaptation.
This is likely to be true, certainly in African populations
where there is a high level of standing variation, but
validating any phenotypic eect of such subtle changes is
challenging. As well as single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP), multiallelic copy number variation (mCNV) is
another source of genomic variation, where individuals
dier in the number of copies of a gene, with several
alleles within a population. mCNV is extensive and its
evolutionary role is underexplored. Despite this, there
are two notable instances where mCNV may underly a
recent adaptation. The rst is the amylase locus, where
it has been claimed that higher copy number of the
amylase gene in certain populations is an adaptation
to a starch rich diet. The second is the salivary agglu-
tinin gene, which encodes a protein that binds teeth and
Streptococcus mutans (the causative agent of dental
caries), and where two mCNVs covary with a history
of a starch-rich diet https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/-
pubmed/25848046 . Such ndings strongly suggest this
is an area that will yield new discoveries.
This project will focus on highly-dierentiated mCNVs,
and the genes within them. In particular we will ap-
ply new bioinformatics approaches developed in EJH's
group to utilise short read sequencing to call sequence
variation with copy number variable regions. This will
open up not only the 1000 Genomes samples, which
are currently being sequenced to high depth, but other
samples, including those in the 100K Genomes project.
EJH is a member of the Population genetics Genomics
England Clinical Intepretation partnership. We will
then use these data to fully explore the evolutionary
dynamics of these CNV regions and investigate evidence
of recent selection of particular paralogues.The project is funded by the Midlands Integrative Bio-
sciences Training Partnership by BBSRC. The projects
are for four years, with the rst year being a rotation
between labs across the partner Universities (Leicester,

Title: Adaptive responses of an aquatic vertebrate to
chemical pollution
Reference: BAP-2016-596
Closing date: 2016-12-23
Starting date: 2017-03-01
Project description: Despite chronic exposure to con-
taminants at levels known to elicit toxicities in naive
animal models, sh populations may thrive at highly
polluted sites. Such resistance may involve either
intra-generational physiological acclimation or inter-
generational genetic adaptation. On the other hand,
adaptation doesn't always occur in those situations
where it might be expected. While there is a large body
of research on acute and chronic toxicant responses in
terms of acclimation within generations, the eects of
multi-generational exposure on adaptive responses is
less well understood and among others requires relevant
exposed wildlife populations. The focus of our proposal
involves the identication of the genetic and molecular
mechanisms that underlie evolutionary processes follow-
ing multi-generational exposure to biologically relevant
chemical pollutants. Model organism is the three-spined
stickleback.
The project is part of a larger program that links popu-
lation genomics, ecotoxicology and modeling. The suc-62 EvolDir December 1, 2016
cessful candidate will work in Professor Filip Volckaert's
research group (bio.kuleuven.be/eeb/lbeg) in close col-
laboration with another PhD student at the ecotoxicol-
ogy research group of Gudrun Deboeck at the University
of Antwerpen (B) - https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/-
personeel/gudrun-deboeck/. The group consists of ~12
researchers (senior scientist, postdocs, graduate students
and research engineer) with dierent areas of expertise.
Research at the Volckaert lab focuses on population
genomics of sh and their parasites, and the lab uses
a combination of eld data, monitoring data, experi-
ments, modeling and in depth analysis to understand
the complex patterns of natural and human-induced
genetic variation and their implications for evolutionary
history.
Qualications: A master degree in (applied) biology or
a related eld is required.
The ideal candidate is highly motivated with thorough
education in quantitative disciplines, such as statis-
tical/quantitative/population genetics, bioinformatics,

ments.

ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=78293&LID=829 Evolu-
tionary interactions between hosts, pathogens, and
microbiomes across multiple origins of sociality in
Hymenoptera
Project Description
Sociality produces conditions that are ideal for disease
transmission: large, dense populations of closely re-
lated individuals. Paradoxically, the genomes of all so-
cial insects sequenced to date appear to have a limited
immune repertoire, based on homology to Drosophila
melanogaster. Is this because there are novel immune
pathways in social insects that have no homology toDrosophila? Or is it that immunity in social insects relies
more on their microbiome - the community of commen-
sal bacteria they carry around with them? Either way,
studies focused solely on the classical immune system
are incomplete. This studentship will use transcriptome
sequencing of phylogenetically diverse samples across
solitary, primitively social, and eusocial Hymenoptera,
to understand the connections between eusociality and
immune defense, and how the innate immune system
and the microbiome evolve across multiple independent
origins of sociality. The Hymenoptera have been hugely
important to our understanding of fundamental topics
in evolutionary biology, including sex allocation, kin
selection, and sociality. We aim to resolve longstand-
ing questions about the connection between sociality
and immune defense, and link this research to new in-
sights concerning the role of the microbiome in health
and disease. Through this we will resolve the funda-
mental issue of whether sociality leads to depauperate
immune systems. This project will suit a student with
interests in host-parasite interaction, evolutionary ecol-
ogy, genetics, bioinformatics, and genomics. Existing
skills in any of those areas would be helpful but inde-
pendence, curiosity, a healthy sense of humor, and a
certain amount of grit are usually more important. The
successful student will have the opportunity to work
closely with collaborators at Harvard University and
develop skills in evolutionary ecology, host-parasite in-
teraction, immunology, genomics, transcriptomics, and
metagenomics. The Institute of Integrative Biology of-
fers a lively community of researchers to interact with,
providing many opportunities for collaboration.

The eect of diet on oxidative stress, immune gene

Carotenoids are powerful antioxidants often used as
dietary additives in aquaculture, and reputed to have
eects on immune function, but these, and the conse-
quences for resistance to the parasitic infections that
plague farmed sh, are poorly understood. Carotenoids
are also commonly used by animals in sexual displays,
including the nuptial colouration of three-spined stick-
leback. The evolutionary signicance of these signals
remains unclear, but could be associated with the adver-
tisement of immune function. This project will use
natural variation in sh populations and manipula-
tions of diet, to investigate the eect of carotenoids
on uorescence-based cellular assays of oxidative stress,
proinammatory immune responses and disease resis-
tance in three-spined stickleback.
The project will work with diverse populations of stickle-
back on the Scottish island of North Uist, where we have
already documented large variation in diet, carotenoidavailability, parasite resistance and immune function
among lakes. The student will use this variation to in-
vestigate carotenoid uptake and use eciency by sh, its
genetic basis and how this relates to diet. The ndings
will be relevant to the study of aquaculture, to under-
standing the eects of nutrition on immune function and
to the ecology and evolution of wild sh populations.

Project description
While our bodies are bilaterally symmetric on the out-
side, the internal organs exhibit consistent, directional
asymmetries in their position or anatomy, such that
left/right positional errors are an important class of
human birth defect, and in later life, numerous dis-
eases aect seemingly symmetric organs in a lateralised
fashion. However, while invariant left/right asymmetry
appears to be the rule in nearly all animals, until re-
cently it has not been clear if the path to asymmetry is
conserved, or how/why the left/right axis is consistently
set up in the same direction (e.g. heart to the left). In
a recent breakthrough published in Current Biology (26:
654-660), the Davison lab and collaborators in Scotland,
Germany and the USA identied the one in a billion
base pair change that determines mirror image develop-
ment (\chirality") in the pond snail, nally identifying
the rst described locus that reverses the whole body
structure of an animal. As we also showed that the same
gene is similarly involved in setting up asymmetry in
the frog, then our work that began in snails ultimately
revealed one of the earliest common symmetry-breaking
steps across the whole of the Bilateria. The next stage
of the project is to 'unravel' symmetry breaking at the
molecular and cellular level, in particular to nd the set
of genes that rst establish asymmetry, and ultimately,
to dene general rules for how this is translated into
creating left-right asymmetric snail shells and vertebrate
bodies. In this exciting and fast-moving, but quite ex-
ible project, the student will seek to understand why
snails routinely vary in their chirality, unlike any other
animal group, and how this asymmetry is set up. Ac-
cording to need and specic interests, the student will
use the pond snail system, perhaps undertake eld work
in other countries, and conduct genetic and genomic
research, from both developmental and evolutionary
perspectives.

index.php In eukaryotes, 'co-adapted gene complexes'
comprised of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes must
work closely together in the production of energy by
oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos). When this essential
biochemical cooperation breaks down, the consequences
for cells and organisms are serious. Consideration of
the coadaptation of nuclear and mitochondrial genes
and the speed with which mitonuclear incompatibilities
can evolve has stimulated a novel hypothesis for the
process of speciation. This proposes that once gene ow
between populations is disrupted, the high mutational
rate of mitochondrial genes will lead to rapid and
unpredictable divergences between populations in
coadaption. The breakdown of nuclear-mitochondrial
coadaptation following subsequent secondary contact
and hybridisation between divergent taxa may be a
common cause of reproductive isolation and speciation.
Thus far, this idea has been examined in only a
handful of organisms, and only once in vertebrates.
This studentship will investigate the contribution of
mitonuclear conict to speciation in stickleback, a small66 EvolDir December 1, 2016
sh with excellent genomic resources.
Three-spined stickleback have repeatedly colonised fresh-
water from the sea. The contrasting energetic and os-
motic demands of marine and freshwater environments
exert strong selection on genes involved in oxphos path-
ways, potentially favouring strong selection on nuclear-
mitochondrial coadaptation. On the Scottish island of
North Uist there are hybrid zones between marine and
freshwater stickleback populations that originate from
distinct mitochondrial clades that are ~120,000 years di-
verged. Hybridisation in these contact zones is strongly
asymmetric, with freshwater mtDNA introgressing into
marine sh, but not vice versa. This is strongly sugges-
tive of mitonuclear conict contributing to speciation
in these sh. In this project the student will combine
traditional analysis of genetic crosses with cutting-edge
genomics and assays of mitochondrial function, as well
as behavioural and ecological eldwork, to assess the
contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to speciation
in stickleback.

Project description
Snails and slugs are a major crop pest, with a few in-
troduced species causing massive worldwide problems.
Yet, they are dicult to identify and we have little
idea of how this biodiversity has come about, hinder-
ing appropriate control and conservation eorts. This
project will use next generation sequencing methods to
investigate the evolution, speciation and diversication
of snails, especially with respect to characters under
natural and articial selection (e.g. shell colour and
banding or molluscide resistance), and including meth-
ods that may help identify cryptic species, or species of
conservation concern. For example, building upon the
work of a recent student who investigated the diversity
within colour polymorphic Cepaea, the next step may
be to investigate the degree of parallelism and conver-
gence between this and other species. Ultimately, the
precise project will be determined by the interests of the
student, but the overall aim is that he/she will begin to
determine if the same modes of speciation and evolution
are involved in widely divergent species, with the project
having implications for both control and conservation
of molluscan biodiversity. Although much of the work
will be lab-based, with a concomitant bioinformaticsDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 67

During the lab rotation the student will receive training
in several of the techniques that are a necessary com-
ponent of the larger PhD project. Depending upon the
existing skills of the student, these are likely to include
a range of molecular biology techniques (e.g. DNA ex-
traction, PCR, RNA methods), analysis (e.g. mapping
genes to chromosomes), simple (e.g BLAST searching)
and more advanced bioinformatics (e.g. phylogenetics,
introduction to biolinux). Depending upon the precise
time of year (snails hibernate in winter), it may also be
possible to conduct some eld work - e.g. identifying
possible eld sites for later in depth study.

ComparativePhylogeography
I am recruiting graduate students to join me at the
University of Oklahoma starting Fall 2017! My lab
merges comparative phylogeography with biogeography,
community ecology and macroecology to explore the
patterns of genetic diversity and divergence which un-
derpin the shape and limits of species' geographical
ranges, the structure and membership of ecological com-
munities, and how these relate to continental and global
biodiversity patterns. We also use species' responses to
past environmental dynamics to better predict the con-
sequences of contemporary environmental change. My
work includes a blend of eld/lab-based and database-
oriented research, and I invite students with interests
in either or both. Past eld work has centered around
New Zealand, but in the next few years, we will estab-
lish a eld program in Oklahoma, which has one of thesteepest environmental gradients in the United States.

MacroevolutionPaleontology
PhD Fellowship in Paleontology/Macroevolution at
UPenn A PhD fellowship is available in the Department
of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of
Pennsylvania, starting in Fall 2017. Prof. Lauren Sallan
seeks a graduate student to address major questions
about the evolution of life. These include: how global
change has aected life over time, how life evolves at
high levels (macroevolution), the relationships of living
and dead animals (phylogeny), and the origins of living
biodiversity. While research in the lab has focused on
shes, any suitable group of fossils may be used.
Potential thesis topics include, but are not limited to:
the long-term eects of mass extinctions (e.g. the end-
Devonian and end-Ordovician), the roles of predation
and competition in marine ecosystem evolution, charac-
teristics of adaptive radiations and \living fossils," the
eects of long-term climate and environmental changes
(e.g. the Late Paleozoic Ice Age) on biodiversity, and
major transitions in early vertebrate evolution (e.g. ori-
gin of jaws, invasion of land). The student can also
develop a novel project that addresses similar ques-
tions using quantitative, phylogenetic and/or descriptive
methods. This is fully-funded fellowship with stipend
and tuition support guaranteed for the length of the
PhD. Applicants are encouraged to contact Prof. Sal-
lan (lsallan@upenn.edu) for more details. Additional
information on the fellowship is available on the depart-
mental website: www.sas.upenn.edu/earth. Applica-
tions for entry in Fall 2017 are due January 15, 2017,

SexChromosomeEvolution
Evolutionary dynamics of the avian sex chromosomes
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic
PhD student to study the evolution of the avian sex
chromosomes.
Lead supervisor: Dr Alison Wright, University of
Sheeld Co-supervisors: Prof Jon Slate (University of
Sheeld), Prof Steve Paterson (University of Liverpool)
Deadline for applying: 9th January 2017
The PhD project will provide an excellent opportunity to
learn state-of-the-art genomic skills to study sex chromo-
somes and test clear theoretical predictions. Applicants
should have strong analytical skills and an enthusiasm
for evolutionary genomics. The successful candidate
will be trained in cutting-edge bioinformatics and ge-
nomic techniques. The applicant will benet from the
diverse range of expertise oered by the co-supervisors
and researchers within the Animal and Plant Sciences
Department at the University of Sheeld.
Sex chromosomes are the only region of the genome
to dier between females and males and are therefore
predicted to be hotspots of sexual selection, with impor-
tant roles in sexually dimorphic phenotypes. As the Y
chromosome is inherited from father to son, and the W
chromosome from mother to daughter, they are thought
to be particularly important for fertility. However, in
many species these sex-limited chromosomes have expe-
rienced rapid decay of gene content and contain only a
handful of genes. Why some genes are retained while the
majority are lost is a fundamental question in sex chro-
mosome evolution yet the evolutionary drivers remain
unclear. Birds are an ideal system to test key evolu-
tionary theories as avian sex chromosomes have been
diverging independently and in parallel across dierent
species over millions of years.
The exact details of the project can be tailored to the
particular interests of the student. The student will use
next-generation sequencing data to study the evolution
of the sex chromosomes across multiple bird species.
This will make it possible to test key evolutionary hy-
potheses about gene expression evolution, sexual conict
and sex chromosome degeneration.

StructuralColourEvolution
The evolution of iridescent blue colour in Heliconius
butteries and its role in behaviour Lead supervisor:
Dr Nicola Nadeau, Department of Animal and Plant
Sciences, University of Sheeld Co-supervisor: Prof
Mike Speed, Institute of Integrative Biology, University
of Liverpool. Closing date: 9th January
We are seeking an enthusiastic student with interests
in evolution and behaviour to work on a project in-
vestigating the role of iridescent structural colour in
predator avoidance and mate choice in Heliconius but-
teries. The bright wing colours of these butteries act
as warnings to predators and mimicry between species
facilitates predator learning and reduces attack rates.
Wing colours are also used for mate choice and attrac-
tion. The main colours used are red, yellow and black,
due to pigments, but a small number of species also
exhibit iridescent blue/green, due to sub-micron scale
structures. The role of these colours in deterring preda-
tors and attracting mates is less well understood. The
project can be tailored to the interests of the student
but would likely involve experiments using captive but-
tery populations in South/Central America and the
UK, and could involve experiments with wild or captive
avian predators or theoretical modelling. The project
would also tie in with ongoing work on the genetic basis
of these traits. Interested candidates are also welcome
to contact Nicola Nadeau (details below) for further
information.
If successful, the student would be fully funded for aminimum of 3.5 years, studentships cover: (i) a tax-free
stipend at the standard Research Council rate (at least
14,296 per annum for 2017-2018), (ii) research costs,
and (iii) tuition fees at the UK/EU rate. Studentship(s)
are available to UK and EU students who meet the UK
residency requirements. Students from EU countries
who do not meet residency requirements may still be
eligible for a fees-only award.

based partly at the University of Southampton and
partly at the NHM, London. Please do contact
myself (M.Chapman@soton.ac.uk) or Mark Carine
(M.Carine@nhm.ac.uk) if you have any questions. Pass
on to potential students if you know of some. Applica-
tion deadline is 2nd January.
This project will analyse speciation genomics in a plant
genus found throughout the Canary Islands in a wide va-
riety of habitats. Several species are endemics, showing
ecological speciation (the origin of species by adapta-
tion to novel environments) within and between islands.
A reference genome is being assembled and annotated
and the SPITFIRE project will generate and analyse
sequencing data from multiple individuals of all the
endemic species.
Specic objectives: 1. Phylogenetic analyses of the
dynamics of speciation, including the role of introgres-70 EvolDir December 1, 2016
sion in speciation. 2. Measuring divergent adaptation
between species through a reciprocal transplant experi-
ment on Tenerife. 3. Identication of candidate genes
underlying ecological speciation. 4. Determining the
function of a subset of these candidate genes using trans-
genics.

Microbe Wars: Exploring the Maintenance of Microbial
Diversity Using Articial Life
A PhD studentship in computational biology is available
at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.
Microbes are the most ubiquitous life form on Earth,
found everywhere from exotic locations - black smokers
on the ocean bottom - to the inside of every human's gut.
They are essential for nearly all life on the planet, driv-
ing nutrient cycling in the environment and contributing
to the health of plants and animals. Microbes are also
critical to industrial biotechnology, especially for fuel,
ne chemical and drug production. Thus, understanding
how microbial ecosystems are maintained is essential.
Evolutionary processes within microbial communities
appear fundamentally dierent than those at play in
macro-organisms, requiring specic understanding.
In this studentship, you will develop articial life simu-
lations to explore evolution and maintenance of biodi-
versity in microbial communities. You will use machine
learning and mathematical modelling to identify and
assess strategies leading to stable communities that also
maintain biodiversity. You will explore how communities
respond to perturbation, corresponding to phenomena
such as provision of antibiotics to a patient, and human
intervention in industrial and agricultural systems.
Your work will have applications in many areas. It is
increasingly clear that the microbial communities within
our bodies are key contributors to health: because the
benecial eects of these communities are in danger from
both antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, un-
derstanding how healthy biodiversity can be maintained
in the face of perturbation is essential. Maintenance
of soil microbial diversity is important for plant health,
and ultimately our food security. Microbial populations
in all contexts may share essential features of community
assembly, and this project will inform multiple topic
areas.December 1, 2016 EvolDir 71
You will gain training in articial life simulations, genetic
algorithms, machine learning, game theory, microbial
genomics and metabolism, and mathematical modelling,
and will acquire a working knowledge of microbial com-
munities and their importance on our planet.
Your project will take place in St Andrews' Centre
for Biology Diversity (CBD) in the School of Biology,
and will be jointly supervised by Dr V Anne Smith
from the School of Biology, Dr John Mitchell from the
School of Chemistry, and Dr Leighton Pritchard from
the James Hutton Institute. All three groups work in
complementary areas of computational systems biology
and machine learning. For more information on their

SUMMARY Why do so few animals use tools, and
why are we humans so good at it? Dr Christian Rutzs
research group tries to shed light on this fascinating sci-
entic puzzle by studying tool-using crows. The groups
discovery that the Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis)
is a highly procient tool user { published recently as
the cover story of Nature { creates unprecedented op-
portunities for comparative studies with tool-using New
Caledonian crows (C. moneduloides) and naturally non-
tool-using corvids. This PhD project will contribute
to this exciting new research programme. There is
considerable exibility with regards to specic study
objectives, but the successful candidate is likely to con-
duct both eldwork and aviary-based experiments, with
excellent scope for collaboration with other group mem-
bers (currently, 2 Postdocs and 3 PhD students). This
fully-funded PhD project oers excellent opportunities
for a highly motivated student to join a dynamic and
prolic research group, to conduct topical research on
the evolutionary ecology of animal tool behaviour, and
to receive training in state-of-the-art research method-
ologies.
CENTRE FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY The Cen-
tre for Biological Diversity (CBD) at the University of
St Andrews provides a highly interactive and stimulat-
ing environment for doctoral studies, with particular

USussex BalancedPolymorphism
A PhD position is available to investigate the role of bal-
ancing selection in the maintenance of genetic variation
with Adam Eyre-Walker at the University of Sussex.
Project overview : Almost all organisms have substan-
tial levels of genetic variation, but why there is so much
genetic diversity? and why does the quantity dier
so little between species? These remain fundamental
puzzles in the eld of population genetics. It has long
been appreciated that balancing selection, either in the
form of heterozygous advantage or frequency dependent
selection, could potentially maintain large amounts of
variation, but both types of selection have received littleattention because they are dicult to test for. The aim
of the project is to use several novel tests of balancing
selection in a broad variety of organisms to test for the
signature of balancing selection. Each of these tests will
leverage the prediction that neutral and selected genetic
variation behave dierently, with selected variation be-
ing maintained in the population at higher frequency
and for longer periods of time. The tests will be applied
to those species for which we have population genomic
datasets ^ a e\ i.e. the whole genome has been sequenced
in multiple individuals. There are now dozens of species
for which these data are available, from humans with
thousands of genomes to some organisms with just a
handful of sequences. The project will build on the su-
pervisors previous work estimating the rate of adaptive
evolution between species (James et al. 2016, Castellano
et al. 2016, Gossmann et al. 2012, Gossman et al. 2011,
Eyre-Walker 2006). Besides shedding light on a funda-
mental problem in population genetics, the project will
give the student experience in computer programming,
bioinformatics, population genetic theory and statistics.

UUppsala PopulationGenomics
A PhD student position in population genomics is avail-
able at the department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala
University.
Closing date: 2016-12-01.
Project description: The demographic history of many
species is currently being addressed with modern com-
putational methods combined with population genomic
data, especially humans that often function as a model
organism in this respect. In order to understand popu-
lation divergence processes, concepts of eective popu-
lation size, population structure and genetic diversity
become important. Linking eective population size as a
function of time to population divergence and structure
is a major challenge for modern population genomics and
computational biology. The proposed project focuses
on trying to disentangle population structure and diver-
gence from population size (both eective and census)
changes. The project will investigate these processes
using large-scale population genomic data from humans
and archaic humans such as Neandertals.
The project is part of a larger program that links theoret-
ical population genetics, genomics and human evolution.
The successful candidate will work in Professor Mat-
tias Jakobsson research group together with Dr. Per
Sj odin. The group consists of ~25 researchers (senior
scientist, postdocs, graduate students and research en-
gineers) with dierent areas of expertise. The research
at the Jakobsson lab focus on population genetics and
human evolution and the lab uses a combination of
mathematical studies of population genetic models and
computational approaches to understand the complex
patterns of large-scale human genetic variation and their
implications for human demographic and evolutionary
history. In particular, the research focuses on under-
standing human evolution using genetic information
from both recent and ancient individuals, developing74 EvolDir December 1, 2016
statistical methods for analyzing large genomic data,
and searching for genes targeted by selection.
Qualications: A master degree (or equivalent) in a
relevant eld is required. The ideal candidate is highly
motivated with thorough education in quantitative disci-
plines, such as statistical/quantitative/population genet-
ics, bioinformatics, computer science, statistics, mathe-
matics and with a strong interest in population genetics
and human evolution.

AppliedBioinformatics
PhD studentships in Applied Bioinformatics are avail-
able at the University of Western Australia
The Laboratory of Applied Bioinformatics is seeking
highly motivated PhD students to work on genomics and
bioinformatics. With the global population expected to
rise to 10 billion by 2050 and climate change already
impacting agricultural practices, there is a need for im-
proved crops to meet increasing demand for food and
address changing climatic conditions. Genomics and
bioinformatics provide novel solutions to accelerate crop
improvement and enhance global food security. Plant
genomes also dier greatly from animal genomes in
complexity and oer fascinating examples of adaptive
evolution.
Our lab uses computational methods to investigate the
genomic diversity of a broad range of species groups
including Brassica, wheat, pulses, as well as environmen-
tally important species such as seagrass. In our research,
we perform population genotyping and assembly of com-
plete genomes using cutting-edge genomic technologies,
and develop bioinformatic tools and platforms to visu-
alise and interpret genomic data. We are a diverse, inter-
national group with backgrounds in evolutionary biology,
genomics, bioinformatics and engineering. You can learn
more about our research and recent publications on our
website (http://www.appliedbioinformatics.com.au/).
Available PhD projects include analysis of genome di-
versity in Brassica species and pulses such as soybean
and chickpea in relation to morphology and agronomictraits, investigation of seagrass genome evolution with
a focus on adaptation to the marine environment and
comparison of cereal genomes as part of ongoing inter-
national eorts to sequence and compare diverse grass
genomes related to cereal crop plants. The data under-
lying these projects can be readily applied to address
questions in genome evolution, polyploidization, pat-
terns of diversication and crop improvement, while
also providing starting points for the development of
bioinformatic tools. In this studentship, you will gain
training in applied bioinformatics, genomics, complex
data analysis, and will acquire a working knowledge of
plant biotechnology and its importance for global food
security.
The group receives funding from the University of West-
ern Australia, the Australian Research Council, and
several industry partners. Your project will take place
in the School of Plant Biology in Perth, which oers
an international and dynamic research environment,
and has an annual budget of nearly 16 million dol-
lars, 120 postgraduate students and 90 sta members,
including numerous highly cited researchers ( http://-
www.plants.uwa.edu.au/). Perth has been consistently
ranked as one of the ten most liveable cities in the
world, boastinga Mediterranean climate and relaxed
lifestyle in a sophisticated city with beautiful beaches
and parks ( https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/-
western-australia/perth).
Candidates must hold a MSc degree or equivalent in
Biology, Bioinformatics or Computer Science and have
strong interest in computing, complex data analysis, or
genomics. Experience in programming (e.g. in Python
or R) is not required but is a plus as the project will
be computational without wet lab' components. The
preferred candidate needs to be highly motivated, enthu-
siastic and a good team player with excellent communi-
cation skills. During the PhD, there will be potential
for an internship in Europe with an industry partner.
Review of applications will start ASAP, and positions
will remain open until lled. PhD studentships can
commence from January 2017 but later commencement
dates are possible.
A fully funded 4-year PhD studentship is available
for candidates with a strong academic record, sat-

*Project description:*
Britain's forests oer key habitat for woodland species;
however, maintaining biodiversity under the demands
of timber production can be challenging. The highly
fragmented nature of British woodlands is a further
challenge because fragmentation leads to isolation, usu-
ally reducing genetic diversity of woodland dwelling
species, particularly in species with poor dispersal abil-
ities and exacting habitat requirements such as wood
ants (*Formica rufa* group). These species, threatened
across Europe, are key components of woodland ecosys-
tems and oer an ideal study system to explore the
impact of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of
a woodland species.
This study will clarify the conservation status of a ge-
netically unusual wood ant population in the North
York Moors (NYM) and will use wood ants to study
how dispersal and habitat fragmentation inuence the
formation of hybrids and new species. We will do this by
comparing the genetic diversity of the NYM population
to samples from across the UK and Eurasia. The data
will explain what creates the unusually high diversity
in the NYM and allow investigation of how wood ants
spread and diversied at the continental scale after the
last glacial period.
*Research team* The collaboration involves the Uni-
versity of York, CASE partner Forest Research, and a
project partner (University of Helsinki). The supervi-
sory team provide a range of skills, including genetic
techniques, eldwork skills, landscape analysis, andexpertise in forest management and invertebrate ecol-
ogy/evolution. This combination oers a challenging
and well-supported training environment and enables
the student to acquire a diverse skill-set with excellent
employment prospects.
*Applications* The results of our research will set the
NYM wood ant population in its broader European
context which will inform foresters, including Forestry
Commission practitioners, and DEFRA policy-makers,
in the development of appropriate management strate-
gies for the conservation and promotion of this key

Wageningen InsectPestEvolution
Wageningen.InsectPestEvolution
Insects have an amazing ability to adapt to diverse food
resources, often by shifting to new host-plants and/or by
overcoming plant defenses. So called \insect pest species"
are of particular interest due to the growing demand for
human food production worldwide and the challenges
for agriculture to deal with losses due to herbivorous in-
sects. But, what makes a pest a pest? As a PhD student,
you will study the genetic basis of \pestiness" using a
comparative phylogenomic framework. You will com-
bine insect feeding assays of closely related moth species
with next-generation sequencing-based transcriptional
analysis to identify putative candidate genes involved in
\pestiness" and to trace their evolutionary origins using
phylogenomic approaches.
The PhD project is funded by The Graduate School
Experimental Plant Sciences (EPS) under the supervi-
sion of Dr. Sabrina Simon in the Biosystematics Group,
Wageningen UR. The inter-university Graduate School
'Experimental Plant Sciences' (EPS) is a collaborative

sity (WU), Radboud University (RU), Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam (VU), Leiden University (LU), University
of Amsterdam (UvA), Utrecht University (UU) and Uni-
versity of Groningen (RUG). The mission of EPS is to
organize the training of PhD students and postdocs to
become self-reliant researchers.

SexDeterminationEvolution
Background One of the most important stages during
development is the sex determination. After all, the
consequence of being male or female has a profound
eect on the biology of the individual, aecting many
aspects of its life-history. On a species level, sex determi-
nation systems also aect the evolution of reproductive
modes which are one of the driving forces of specia-
tion. Even though the occurrence of only two sexes is
universal in plants and animals, the molecular mecha-
nisms for sex determination are extraordinarily variable,
especially in insects. However, despite the variety of
sex determining mechanisms in insects, within the hap-
lodiploid Hymenoptera still only two mechanisms are
molecularly understood: the Complementary Sex De-
terminer (CSD) mechanism in Apis mellifera, and the
parental imprinting mechanism (MEGISD) in Nasonia
vitripennis. It is unknown how many dierent systems
are present within the Hymenoptera and if the expected
divergence in sex determining mechanisms is related to
the phylogenetic distances of organismal groups. The
genus Muscidifurax is a close relative of Nasonia. It
contains the sister-species M. uniraptor, which is in-
fected with the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia,
causing asexual reproduction, and M. raptorellus, which
is uninfected and reproduces sexually. We currently
have a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which
Wolbachia achieves asexual reproduction in its host in
general and M. uniraptor in particular, as we have hardly
any knowledge of the plethora of sex determining mech-
anisms. Therefore, research into the sex determining
mechanisms of the Wolbachia-infected M. uniraptor and
the uninfected M. raptorellus will greatly advance our
understanding of the mechanisms that Wolbachia can
employ to alter its host reproduction.December 1, 2016 EvolDir 79
To elucidate the sex determining mechanism of M. rap-
torellus and M. uniraptor and compare this system to
Nasonia vitripennis and other insects, we have a va-
cancy for a PhD position. The PhD student will aim to
identify homologs of the known sex determination genes
and perform functional analyses to determine the sex
determining mechanism. In addition, the PhD student
will study the role of Wolbachia in manipulating sex
determination in M. uniraptor.
We ask: The successful candidate has an MSc degree
in Biology or Molecular Life Sciences with a specializa-

development and gene regulation, biological chemistry

candidates who can work in a multidisciplinary team in
a collaborative spirit. Within the Laboratory of Ento-

gently needed for early detection, monitoring, and pre-
venting the spread of these AIS. eDNA tests are also
needed for monitoring endangered species such as bull
trout and salmon. This position will oversee and or-
ganize existing monitoring work and lab testing, and
help develop new lab protocols, eDNA assays, and eld
sampling protocols. The project will also develop and
compare PCR technologies (digital and real time) and
perhaps next gen sequencing methods to quantify their
relative sensitivity and specicity on many of the most
insidious AIS and the most threatened salmonids inDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 105
North America. We are especially interested in and
concerned about stopping the spread of zebra mussels
which were discovered in Montana last summer (2016).
The applicant may also work on additional exciting pop-
ulation genomics projects including trout and stoney
adaption to extreme environments (captivity, climate
change), and travel to conduct sh and eDNA sampling
in beautiful areas such as Glacier National Park, Yellow-
stone National Park, Flathead Lake, and streams across
Montana. Skills required: The applicant should have
substantial experience conducting qPCR and ideally
eDNA analyses or noninvasive or ancient DNA analyses
(including sample extraction). The applicant should
have demonstrated ability to write and publish papers,
organize and manage lab supplies, and ideally to oversee
and train others. Proven ability to communicate with
others from diverse groups (e.g. agencies, managers,
researchers, the public), establish collaborations, and
write small grant proposals are highly desirable.
Applications: Send a brief letter ( <1 page) describ-
ing your motivation and background, your CV, and
the names and contact information for three references
to both G. Luikart and S. Amish. Review of applica-
tions will start November 29th and remain open until a
suitable candidate is hired.
Salary: Negotiable, but likely approximately $26,000
to $33,000 the rst year depending on experience and
CV. We would consider hiring a postdoc with higher
salary if the applicant has demonstrated high produc-
tivity, experience, and is passionate about preventing

CORBEL OpenCall Infrastructure
I'm contacting you on behalf of the H2020 project COR-
BEL (www.corbel-project.eu).This cluster project of 11 research infrastructures aims
to support European researchers from academia and
industry and their advanced interdisciplinary research
projects by establishing a platform of aligned customised
services. Beginning of October we launched an Open
Call for research projects from academia and industry;
selected researchers will then have the unique opportu-
nity to gain open access to state-of-the-art technologies
and services oered by these research infrastructures
across biological and medical sciences. In order to dis-
tribute this Open Call to the scientic community, I
would like to ask whether it is possible that you com-
municate the announcement to your members.
A brief summary of the CORBEL Open Call: CORBEL
- Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Endur-
ing Life-science services - is an EC Horizon2020 project
uniting 11 Biological and Medical Science Research In-
frastructures (RIs). In CORBEL, the participating
RIs expand their cooperation in order to harmonise re-
searchers' access to their cutting-edge technologies and
services by establishing a sustainable platform of aligned
services that will enable faster admission to and a wider
portfolio of technologies and services to boost research
projects from academia and industry.
The CORBEL Open Call invites researchers to apply to
access technologies and services from more than 15 facil-
ities from eight dierent research infrastructures across
Europe. Selected projects will be allocated to so-called
Access Tracks and gain unprecedented opportunities to
utilise a wide range of high-end technologies and services.
These include state-of-the-art oers from the elds of ad-
vanced imaging, biobanking, curated databases, marine
model organisms, mouse mutant phenotyping, screening
and medicinal chemistry, structural biology as well as
systems biology.
Projects will be supported at every stage, with CORBEL
project managers on hand to help scientists navigate
between dierent service providers and exploit the full
potential of the oers available. The CORBEL consor-
tium already launched its Innovation Oce, consisting of
a well-experienced team dealing with the special needs
of industry (e.g. regarding IP issues, condentiality
agreements).

CrowdFunding InsecticideEectBees
Dear list, We are a team of three Postdoctoral Re-
searchers working in the Department of Biological Sci-
ences at North Dakota State University. We are in-
terested in how insecticide exposure may aect nest
construction in the alfalfa leafcutter bee, a critical pol-
linator used in many agricultural crops. We are rais-
ing funds through a crowdfunding campaign in order
to pay for an undergraduate assistant this summer:
https://experiment.com/beenesting . This work will
have critical implications for the management of the
alfalfa leafcutter bee. Furthermore, it will help lay the
groundwork for using nest architecture to study the be-
havior and tness of other solitary bees, including crop
pollinators such as mason bees .We hope this research
will help us better understand how insecticide exposure
aects solitary bee tness, as indicated by nest size
and structure, and elucidate important gaps between
individual and population level dynamics.
You can nd more information on the Bee Grant
Challenge that this project is part of here: https://-
experiment.com/grants/bees. We are already funded
at 20% through this platform and have until December
8th to reach our funding goals.
We sincerely appreciate any help with our campaign.

Dear EvolDir community: This is to alert you of the on-
going challenge grant crowdfunding campaign \ground-
water and caves" which was launched last week: https:/-
/experiment.com/grants/groundwater/ The initiative
features 11 projects, most of them with signicant eco-
logical or evolutionary components. Challenge grants
oer prizes to supplement existing crowdfunding cam-
paigns. Partway through the campaigns, the project
with the highest number of backers will receive an ad-
ditional $500. There are two runners-up prizes of $200
each. So if you feel strongly for one of the projects
you can help by even modest amounts of contributions,
simply by boosting the backer numbers. Of course, any
contribution to science will be greatly appreciated by

Crowdfunding
UndergroundEvolution 2
Hello everyone,
My apology to everyone who received this before. And
my apology to anyone who received this before and
already backed!
No reason to back out, quite the opposite...The newest
backer numbers reveal that we are three backers short
from garnering the $500.00 award of the challenge grant
campaign by experiment.com with the theme \ground-114 EvolDir December 1, 2016
water and caves". As you may remember, the project
with the highest number of backers receives an addi-
tional $500 and there are two runners-up prizes of $200
each.
Unlike last week today, the cave beetle cam-
paign ranks not only solidly at second place
but just three backers away from rst place
in this competition: https://docs.google.com/-
spreadsheets/d/1VnINc2gx0gYqvyjr5Abi
qSuetU1H4mzOHIRk nLCnuw/edit?usp=sharing
So things heated up quite a bit. As stated before, it
doesn't need to be a big amount. A single dollar does
already make a huge dierence.
And spreading the news among nature enthusiasts is
equally important and appreciated.
Three new backers may be all we need in the next 36
hours. That's bc the winners of the challenge grant will
be announced at 6pm EDT on November 23rd. Clearly,
we can do this.
One more time for your convenience: https://-
experiment.com/cavebeetles Let me know in case you
have questions or comments or suggestions of science
social media outlets to put this on!
Thanks much in advance for your time and eort!

ExtractingDNA BirdBlood
Dearlist members,
Iwas wondering if anyone had any suggestions for get-
ting the best DNA yield from bird blood samples stored
in ethanol?
Itypically extract DNA using a slightly modied Qiagen
DNeasy Blood and Tissue protocol. Our samples are
usually stored in Queen's Lysis buer so the yield is
high and the sample digestion step is straightforward.
Wouldbe great to hear the experiences of others and I'll
happily post responses to the list.
Manythanks in advanceMark

ExtractingDNA BirdBlood answers
Dearll,
Manyhanks for the excellent replies to my query on
extracting DNA from ethanol stored bird blood samples.
They were extremely helpful and I have copied them
below to redistribute to the list as promised!
Allhe best

Markavinet Researcher CEESslo

*** Iave had amazing results using the Phe-
nol:Chloroform extraction method. I have been doing
this for over 10 years and always end up with so much
DNA I need to keep diluting it! I do an ethanol pre-
cipitation at the nal step and re suspend my pellet in
water.
*** Iave always used the proteinase K/phenol:chroloform
protocol, and is quite good (better than any kit I have
ever tried). You just need to clean the blood from the
alcohol with some TE before starting
*** When have to deal with avian blood samples in
ethanol, I always have two phases clearly separated in
my tubes. Iemove the most ethanol I can, then take
blood cells (with ne tweezers for example) and put
them in the new tube I will use for extraction. I let this
tube open for a few minutes to evaporate ethanol (which
could interfere with the extraction steps). Then use the
Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue standard protocol (for
nucleated blood cells
*** Iave used two protocols for this. Usually you get
the highest amount with a phenol-chloroform protocol.
The problem I faced there was that I had diculties
getting the DNA into solution again. You'll usually get
this with high molecular weight DNA. However, this
was not a problem for Illumina sequencing for the few
birds for which we used this DNA. For most samples
I then used a modied protocol of the DNeasy Blood
and Tissue protocol. What proved important with this
was to do the proteinase digest in double the volumeDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 115
and to ensure the blood is properly digested. For this, I
usually put one volume of pK at 56oC an hour or two
before leaving for the night, and then added another
volume just before leaving and leaving the digestion run
at 37oC overnight. If there was still some coagulate left
in the morning, I added yet another volume of pK to
56oC until it was digested.
*** Ineneral, for high yield AND high molecular weight
DNA, I usually go for phenol-chloroform extraction, as
it is ecient and can render really good quality (if youre
careful). Therotocol is optimized for blood collected in
SET buer, but Ive modied it for samples stored in
EtOH, i.e. picking out blood, quickly letting the EtOH
evaporate, and putting it in SET to proceed with the
protocol. Its important to only letting the EtOH evapo-
rate rather briey, or the blood will turn rock solid if it
is left to dry for long. Now were on details, but some
blood samples form chunks similar to coarse sawdust:
these samples are great and simple to handle, pieces can
easily be picked out with a toothpick or similar. Some
blood samples instead behave as more or less dissolved,
and these are a bit trickier. I usually centrifuge them
down properly, and use a mini shovel (I really have
no idea about what the tool is called, but something
spoonish that is small enough to reach the bottom of
a tube) to scoop up blood along the wall of the tube.
In either case, just let the blood evaporate in the air,
or gently press a tissue against the sample to suck up
ethanol (especially for the latter type of sample).
Now dont remember the lysis step in the B&T kit, but
if you want to continue with that just put the blood in
the whatever-buer-is-used-for-lysis and continue. This
is at least what I did some ve years ago for some 200
samples used for RADseq, with reasonably good results.
Therere also further optimizations that can be made
for obtaining ridiculously long DNA molecules, such as
picking out the precipitated DNA cloud from the ice-
cold EtOH using a glass sta etc. Let me know if youre
interested in a description of this and the subsequent
washing.
(And,s you will also know, if you are going to RNase
A treat your samples, do it during the lysis step to
avoid the risk of DNA degradation by the enzyme [or
make sure to boil it before use, as DNase most often
co-puries with the RNase].)
*** Wetore most of our blood samples in ethanol. It
doesn't matter what extraction method you use: chelex,
kit, phenol=chloroform. The main thing is you need all
the ethanol to evaporate before you start the extraction.
We typically take 10 ul of blood ethanol mix and put
it in a 1.5 ml tube. Leaving the lid on the tube open,
put the rack in an incubator (37-55C) for 15-30 min orleave it on the bench. The ethanol will take longer to
evaporate at room temp, but both work.
*** Iope everything is going well with you. I have seen
your post in evoldir. Is it because you have experienced
problems with the DNA extraction? It is usually very
straightforward as well. I usually pick up a piece of
blood with a wood dental stick (but it should be at).

Hokkaido VolResAssist
SeabirdBehaviour
Behavioural Ecology of seabirds by using bio-logging
techniques.
Location: Teuri and Rishiri Islands, Hokkaido, Japan.
Duration: 2 months. Job Type: Volunteer.
We use bio-logging devices (e.g. geolocators, GPS
recorders) on two species (Rhinoceros Auklets and Black-
backed Gulls) to study behavioural ecology of colonial
seabirds. Most work will involve assisting a long-term
monitoring project and behavioural studies of post-doc
fellows and graduate students from Hokkaido Univer-
sity coordinated by Yutaka Watanuki, with the daily
monitoring breeding birds and their chicks, and the
deployment and retrieval of tracking devices. It will
also involve entering data collected in the eld into
databases.
We are looking for an enthusiastic, hardworking young
biologist to work as a voluntary Research Assistant to
help with our seabird research on Teuri/Rishiri Island,
Hokkaido, Japan, between May 1st and June 30th 2017.
Previous experience in the eld or in harsh conditions is
desirable, but not essential. Work on Teuri/Rishiri re-
quires long hours (with some work at night and at dawn)
spent in a cold and wet environment and considerable
manual work. A successful candidate should be able
to work independently and have a reasonable level of
tness. Planning to embark on further research degrees
in the future would be preferable. It is also important
that the assistant feels comfortable sharing sometimes
crowded accommodation with a number of colleagues116 EvolDir December 1, 2016
over long periods of time, and can cope with the occa-
sional untidiness inevitably associated with eldwork.
Unfortunately we cannot provide a stipend but accom-
modation (shared and basic) on Teuri/Rishiri will be
covered. However, the project is a great opportunity
to gain valuable experience in modern eld ornithol-
ogy, with bio-logging techniques. There will also be
opportunities for the assistant to learn some analytical
techniques applied to animal movement data or chemi-
cal analytical techniques in the wet-lab. Teuri/Rishiri
has mobile coverage and some access to Internet, how-
ever movements to and from the mainland are limited
because of unpredictable wind conditions. Teuri/Rishiri
is an inhabited island and there are small restaurants
and grocery stores. There is a small community of
other researchers, ringers and volunteers at our shared
accommodation.
If you are interested, please email a CV and a state-
ment of interest and arrange for two letters of ref-
erence to be emailed to akikosho@gmail.com (with
ywata@sh.hokudai.ac.jp in cc). The deadline for sub-
mitting applications (including reference letters) is the
10th January 2017. We will interview the shortlisted
candidates (on Skype) shortly after and we expect to
make a decision by late January.

seeking three volunteers to start working mid-January
and until the end of August 2017 (the position requires
a minimum of 2 months, but preferable for the entire
period).December 1, 2016 EvolDir 117
The volunteers will assist in the collection of courtship
displays and egg-laying data. This work would be part
of a project that aims to understand sexual selection
in parrots of the world. The work will be done with
captive animals that are held in the facilities of the Loro
Parque Fundacion, located in Tenerife, Spain.
Work will include: - recording courtship displays - fol-
lowing up reproduction (sexual displays, mating, and
egg laying) - maintenance of electronic equipment - set-

Chromosomal inversions and Evolution
Location - Tj arn o, Sweden
We study the seaweed y (Coelopa frigida), which has
one of the largest maintained chromosomal inversions in
the animal kingdom (10% of the genome). This inversion
is under strong selection resulting in strong heterosis
in most known populations (generally more than 60%
of individuals are heterokaryotypes) and a cline in the
frequency of the inversion from the North Sea to the
Baltic. Our group is investigating the natural factors
that drive this cline, the genetic causes of heterosis, and
the genetic signatures of selection on the inversion.
We are looking for 1-2 enthusiastic and motivated young
biologists for internships (2-3 months) with our group.
Candidates should have some research experience and
be able to work somewhat independently. Successful
candidates will get experience with y culturing, eld
collections, and molecular lab work. Previous experience
in a molecular lab is desirable.
Unfortunately, we cannot provide a stipend but accom-
modation and travel costs will be covered. Interns will
be based at the Sven Loven Center in Tj arn o (http://-
loven.gu.se/english) a research station with an interna-
tional group working on diverse topics.
Candidates MUST have demonstrated prociency inEnglish by one of the following: 1. Coming from an

WaspBehaviourEvol
Job: Two Field Assistants Required for Study of Social
Behaviour on Tropical Wasps
January 9 ^th- April 7 ^th 2016
Applications are invited for highly motivated eld assis-
tants to work with a PhD researcher from Prof. Jeremy
Field's research lab in the department of Life Sciences
at the University of Sussex (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/-
lifesci/eldlab/).
Two eld assistants are required to help with a eld-
based project to investigate the eects of environmental
conditions on social behaviour in Microstigmus wasps.
The eldwork will be conducted in the Choco region
of NW Ecuador, and will run from early January until
early April 2017 (three months in total). This is a great
opportunity to visit some very unique places in a beauti-
ful part of the world as well as gaining valuable tropical
eldwork experience. Successful applicants will obtain
excellent experience of cutting-edge insect behavioural
ecology.
The work will involve hiking an altitudinal transect in
a tropical climate. Applicants should therefore be phys-
ically t, enthusiastic about eldwork, hard-working
and able to maintain a positive attitude when tired.
The work entails assisting a PhD student with data-
collection, marking live wasps (they are very small and
can't sting!), setting up video cameras on specic ob-
servation nests as well as some simple manipulation
experiments. There will be some early mornings and
travelling to and from research sites using local trans-
port. Applicants are expected to have a degree in bio-
logical sciences and some background or keen interest in
behavioural ecology and/or social evolution. Previous
work-experience with social insects and/or in the trop-
ics would be an advantage. A clean driving licence andsome basic knowledge of Spanish also desirable although
not essential. The applicants must be committed to
working the entire 3-month eld season. Because the
work involves recording colour marks on individual ani-
mals, the job would not be suitable for someone who is
colour-blind
All work-related costs in Ecuador will be paid, including
accommodation. Whilst in the eld there will be basic
but comfortable accommodation in a house/ lodge with
hot showers and basic kitchen facilities (although meals
are provided by the reserves). We also hope to have
separate housing in a nearby village to use as a base
during our days o. In addition, each assistant will
receive ^A £500 towards travel costs (air ticket) and a
further ^A £750 contribution towards their expenses/food
whilst not in the eld.
Any queries can be sent to Rosa Bonifacii
(R.bonifacii@sussex.ac.uk) and/or Prof. Jeremy
Field (j.Field@sussex.ac.uk). Applicants should send a
covering letter explaining why they would like to work
on the project and a CV, including contact details
(e-mail addresses/telephone numbers) for the applicant
and 2-3 referees. Applications should be e-mailed as a
single word document to Rosa Bonifacii by November
21^st 2016. Shortlisted applicants will be notied by
e-mail, and will be invited for interview either in person
or over skype/phone soon afterwards.
Many thanks, Rosa Bonifacii

Dear All
In light of recent global events, notwithstanding Brexit
and the forthcoming UK-Euro negotiations, the UK has
received very clear guidance from the UK Government
on the guaranteed funding of EU research programs at
least until the nal Brexit process is complete. This adds
increasing focus to existing and operational research
streams that are available and it would be remiss of me
not to remind the EvolDir community the opportunities
aorded by the multimillion pound investment by the
EU and Welsh European Funding Oce (WEFO) under
the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in
the S^ er Cymru (Welsh Stars) scheme. In a nutshell,
Wales needs more excellent researchers to build critical
mass and attract further research funding into Wales
and there are number of schemes available:
https://businesswales.gov.wales/expertisewales/s=-
EAr-cymru-ii-early-career-fellowships-and-rising-star'-
scheme
Funding competitive, but prestigious Postdoctoral Fel-
lowships from 3-5 years (3-5 years post PhD) and other
support schemes. If anyone is interested in molecular
ecology/genomics/evolution in the broadest sense and
would like to join the MEFGL group at Bangor Uni-
versity, to take advantage of these opportunities, please
don't hesitate to get in touch with myself or another
MEFGL team member and we can explore the possi-
bilities to help you join existing researchers that have
benetted from the funding.

Dear All (url link now xed hopefully)
In light of recent global events, notwithstanding Brexit
and the forthcoming UK-Euro negotiations, the UK has
received very clear guidance from the UK Government
on the guaranteed funding of EU research programs at
least until the nal Brexit process is complete. This adds
increasing focus to existing and operational research
streams that are available and it would be remiss of me
not to remind the EvolDir community the opportunities
aorded by the multimillion pound investment by the
EU and Welsh European Funding Oce (WEFO) under
the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in
the S^ er Cymru (Welsh Stars) scheme. In a nutshell,
Wales needs more excellent researchers to build critical
mass and attract further research funding into Wales
and there are number of schemes available:

%E2%80%98rising-star%E2%80%99-scheme Funding
competitive, but prestigious Postdoctoral Fellowships
from 3-5 years (3-5 years post PhD) and other
support schemes. If anyone is interested in molecular
ecology/genomics/evolution in the broadest sense
and would like to join the MEFGL group at Bangor
University, to take advantage of these opportunities,
please don't hesitate to get in touch with myself or
another MEFGL team member and we can explore the
possibilities to help you join existing researchers that
have benetted from the funding.

Glasgow Evodevo Epigenetics
We seek a theory-driven postdoc to join us to focus on
questions related to evolutionary developmental biol-
ogy and genomics including the genetic and epigenetic
basis of phenotypic change. We oer a highly interdis-December 1, 2016 EvolDir 131
ciplinary group and generous funding support from a
recently awarded NERC Highlight topics grant to Dr
Kevin J. Parsons (PI), Prof. Neil B. Metcalfe, Dr Shaun
S. Killen and Dr Jan Lindstrom.
The project provides an opportunity to take evo-devo
and genomics in a new direction by investigating the
impact that long-term increases in temperature can
have on evolution. The postdoc will be in charge of
leading and applying large-scale population genomic
and QTL mapping approaches to sticklebacks that have
evolved within geothermally-heated and ambient tem-
perature locations in Iceland. A substantial portion
of this research will also involve the use of genomics
to understand patterns of methylation in response to
temperature in both wild and lab-reared populations.
While these genomic approaches will be used, the lab
is phenotype-rst orientated and works at the intersec-
tions of ecology, evolution, physiology, and development.
The postdoc will therefore also have the opportunity to
take part in the design of experiments used to assess
developmental changes in a range of phenotypes.
You will have previous postdoc experience or be near
to completing a relevant PhD and be experienced with
genomics, developmental genetics, and/or epigenetics.
Interest and experience with questions surrounding par-
allel evolution and phenotypic plasticity would be an
asset. As part of a team funded by this NERC grant, you
will work closely with another postdoctoral scientist who
will focus on running lab experiments and behavioural
assays, and a full-time technician who will aid in the
running of a breeding programme and lab work.
Passion for research, team spirit and enthusiasm are
essential. Our team is multidisciplinary with additional
major projects funded by the European Research Coun-
cil (ERC) and NERC. Additional PhD student projects
in the lab of the PI involve collaborations with engi-
neers, statisticians, and physicists demonstrating the
highly active and collaborative research environment
in the University of Glasgow. Further information on
the post can be obtained from Dr. Kevin Parsons

Harvard InfectiousDiseaseGenomics
Summary
The Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at
Harvard Medical School and the Farhat Lab are looking
for a Postdoctoral Fellow in infectious disease genomics.
Pathogens display a remarkable range of variability in
phenotypes relevant to disease including transmissibility,
organ tropism, and antibiotic resistance. Elucidating
the biological mechanisms for these dierences is a fun-
damental question in the study of infectious diseases
and creates new avenues for surveillance, diagnosis and
personalized treatment. The heritability of disease phe-
notypes within pathogen species and their evolution
over generations indicates that they should be geneti-
cally encoded. As a result, the study of pathogen whole
genome sequence (WGS) data is expected to further
our understanding of these traits. The Farhat lab was
one of the rst to use phylogenetic convergence to test
for association between genes and the drug resistance
phenotype on a genome wide scale, and is continuing
in this path for both methodological development and
application to large scale datasets.
Responsibilities
The Postdoctoral Fellow will be responsible for devel-
oping and applying computational methodologies to
identify novel infectious disease genomic markers.
Basic Requirements
We are an interdisciplinary lab. Candidates may have
an MD or PhD degree in epidemiology, bioinformatics,
computational and evolutionary biology, biostatistics, or
a related eld. The candidate interested in this position
must be highly motivated and demonstrate initiative in
assigned tasks.
Additional Requirements
Experience in programming R, Python, and/or Perl
and statistical analysis or at least an interest in learn-
ing these skills will be necessary. The candidate and
PI can work together to delineate the fellow's training
needs and develop a program to fulll this, utilizing the
department and university's wide range of resources.

MNHN Paris PlantBiodiversity
Post-doctoral position at Museum National d'Histoire
Naturelle, Paris France.
The Institut de Systematique Evolution et Biodiversite
seeks applicants for a full-time Post-doctoral position
in macroecology focussing on land plants functional
diversity in islands.
Islands have always intrigued biologists, due to their
remarkable biodiversity. They are considered natural
laboratories of evolutionary specialization and adapta-
tion, because life in isolation has allowed evolution to
take its own course, giving rise to many innovations and
leading to peculiar faunas and oras (Losos and Ricklefs
2009).
Although much of island biology has been well explored,
we still lack documented patterns at large scale in order
to understand the main drivers shaping island biodiver-
sity. Factors such as distance from a source of colonizers
(continents or other islands), size and age are recog-
nized to be important determinants of species richness
in islands.
But, is it true at large scale and for every group of organ-
isms? What does it mean in terms of other biodiversity
features such as Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) or Trait
Diversity (TD)? Our aim is to answer these questions
using our dataset of curated occurrences and trait diver-December 1, 2016 EvolDir 135
sity for land plants, representing a large proportion of
plant diversity on earth. However, several operational
problems appear when dealing with such a large data
set. The main contribution of this project is dealing
with this data to provide an overall understanding of
phylogenetic and trait diversication in islands. In addi-
tion to that, this will also contribute to nding solutions
and designing scripts that can further be applied to any
kind of study of this type.
The specic objectives will be: i) Assessment of the
spatial correlation of phylogenetic diversity with trait
diversity. The aim will be to detect if there is an overall
match, and to investigate the factors that could explain
those matches and mismatches.
ii) Verication of the relationship between island en-
demicity, phylogenetic and trait diversity. Are there
common trends shared by species endemic of island
when compared to species also occurring in continental
areas (here after called widespread for convenience)?
The idea is to test whether island endemics tend to
have more original traits than widespread species, and
how this is associated with phylogenetic diversity. Are
original traits associated with particular branches? Are
there tendencies for appearance of original traits in par-
ticular places of the phylogenetic tree? Did they appear
by convergence? A second step in both studies will be
the analysis of diversication drivers in islands.
We are looking for a passionate scientist with solid back-
ground in macroecology and demonstrated skills in R
and Python languages, desirably applied to manipulat-
ing and analyzing large amounts of data replaced in a
spatial perspective, or very large phylogenies. There is
no language prerequisite. This oer is for a 24 months
full-time position, funded by the Labex BCDiv (Diver-
sites Biologiques et Culturelles). Salary will be commen-
surate with the experience of the candidate. For a rst
job after PhD, gross salary is 30000 Euros/Year (2500
Euros Month). Funds are already secured for the whole
duration of the contract and the successful candidate
shall begin on January 1st 2017.
Candidates' Ph.D. should have been defended and
awarded at November 30th 2016. Candidates will be
selected for an oral presentation at the very beginning
of December. All charges related to the trip to the oral
examination will be taken in charge by our project. We

Montpellier MicrobialGenomics
A funded postdoctoral position in bacterial genomics
and phylogenomics is open at the CEFE (Centre for
Functional and Evolutionary Ecology) in Montpellier,
France.
Project: The recruited postdoc will conduct research
in the framework of the ERC CoG HGTCODONUSE
project. The main goal is to investigate the impact
of codon usage preferences on the success of horizon-
tal gene transfer and on post-transfer gene evolution,
with dierent bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes as
model systems. The results gathered will in particular
help understand the role of codon usage preferences in
shaping the propagation routes of antibiotic resistance.
The project has a strong experimental component, in-
cluding characterization of mutant collections, experi-
mental horizontal transfer and experimental evolution
of the resulting bacterial populations. This experimen-
tal part will employ NGS-assisted tness measurements
and analysis of whole genome sequences after experi-
mental evolution. The experimental core of the project
will be completed by comparative approaches: taking
advantage of the large whole genome data sets currently
available we will investigate the long-term evolutionary
consequences of HGT at the genomic level. The postdoc
recruited will work both on the experimental component
(by taking part in the tness and genomic data analysis)
and on the comparative genomic aspects of the project.
Scientic environment: The postdoc will work in
the \Evolutionary Genetics and Ecology" team within
the Centre for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology
(CEFE), Montpellier, France. http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/-
fr/recherche/ee/gee The CEFE is the largest French
institute for ecology and evolution. It gathers numerous
recognized research groups, particularly in experimental
evolution. It also hosts shared platforms with high-level136 EvolDir December 1, 2016
equipment in microbiology, rearing facilities, molecular
biology and ecological chemistry. The \Evolutionary
Genetics and Ecology" team is a lively, dynamic and
stimulating working environment. The group is com-
posed of 10 permanent researchers and 10 to 15 PhD
students and postdocs working on a diversity of topics:
reproduction system evolution, life-history trait evolu-
tion, mechanisms of adaptation, community evolution
and antibiotic resistance evolution. Finally, Montpel-
lier is a medium-size lively student city in the south
of France, close to the Mediterranean Sea and to the
Cevennes mountains.
Prole: We seek a motivated and enthusiastic scientist
with a PhD degree in Evolutionary Biology and with
strong knowledge and experience in bioinformatics anal-
ysis: NGS data analysis, whole-genome assembly and
phylogenomics. Expertise in theoretical evolutionary
biology would be appreciated. Candidates should be
uent in written and oral English.
Application: Application with CV (including a pub-
lication list), a brief statement of research interests
and contact information for two professional references
should be submitted in an electronic form to St ephanie
Bedhomme (stephanie.bedhomme@cefe.cnrs.fr) before

Moulis EvolutionaryGenomics 2
Post-doctoral fellowship in Evolutionary Genomics
A post-doctoral position is available for two years at
the Station for Theoretical and Experimental Ecology
(Moulis, France) in the eld of evolutionary genomics.
Project objectives
The main objective of the project is to determine the
molecular bases of organisms response to environmental
changes using an Evolve and Resequence framework.
To do so, we are currently running experimental evo-lution on species of the genus Tetrahymena (ciliated
protozoa) submitted to divergent environmental treat-
ments. The candidate will be in charge of the genomic
part of the project and will compare the patterns of
genome/transcriptome evolution of the evolved lines.
By relating whole genome/transcriptome proles to the
phenotypic changes observed both between and within
species, and by searching for footprints of selection,
the candidate would determine some of the molecular
mechanisms responsible for phenotypic response to en-
vironmental variation. The candidate will also develop
SNPs to allow discrimination of our laboratory lines of
Tetrahymena thermophila, which have been used in sev-
eral microcosm experiments. In particular, he/she will
analyze the genetic composition of experimental meta-
populations that were confronted to dierent climatic
scenarios in a fragmented landscape. The candidate will
lead a genomic network within the Station for Theoret-
ical and Experimental Ecology. He/she will organize
regular meetings with members of the lab performing
analyses of NGS datasets in order to share information
on bioinformatics and biostatistics pipelines. The can-
didate will thus collaborate on several ongoing genomic
projects including the transcriptomic analysis of individ-
uals with dierent dispersal abilities in butteries. In
addition, it would be relevant if the candidate is inter-
ested in participating in the ongoing thought in Moulis
about the impact of the use of omics in ecology (e.g.
much increased environmental footprint or increased
disconnection with non-scientists).
Candidate prole
The ideal candidate should have a PhD in the eld of
genomics with expertise in bioinformatics and biostatis-
tics. Good knowledge in evolutionary ecology and the
molecular basis of evolution is strongly recommended.
The candidate should also have good communication
skills, and should be autonomous and organized.
Contact
The closing date is xed to the 16th of December. The
candidate should begin in the rst half of 2017. To apply,
please send a cover letter, CV, summary of past work,
and two letters of recommendation to Herv e Philippe

UBasel EvoDevoNeuroEvolution
Postdoc: UBasel.EvoDevoNeuroEvolution A fully
funded postdoctoral position is available in the Lab-
oratory of Regulatory Evolution (Tschopp group) at the
Zoological Institute, University of Basel, Switzerland.
The lab's research interests focus on how developmental
processes can get modied, to give rise to morphologi-
cal diversication on an evolutionary time-scale. As a
model system, we are studying the development of the
vertebrate skeleton with its associated neuromuscular
system.
Vertebrate autopods (hands and feet) display the highest
degree of morphological diversication in the appendicu-
lar skeleton, reecting e.g. distinct modes of locomotion.
While digit loss in the autopod has occurred in multiple
vertebrate lineages, there seems to be a strong constraint
to maintain the maximum number of digits at ve, even
though extra digits might prove benecial in certain
species.
The present project will investigate the potential for de-velopmental plasticity in the limb neuromuscular system
in response to changes in dactyly, i.e. altering digit num-
bers. Specic questions we will address include: How
are muscle patterning and motorneuron axonal pathnd-
ing coping with changes in digit numbers in vertebrate
hands and feet? How is motorneuron pool complexity
in the spinal cord aected by additional digit targets in
the periphery? We will use a range of methods, includ-
ing experimental embryology in chicken, genetic mouse
models, axonal backlling, NextGeneration-Sequencing
and functional experiments using gene knock-down and
overexpression.
The project builds on a solid foundation of conrmed
preliminary data. For more information please visit
http://evolution.unibas.ch/tschopp/research/ We oer
a highly interactive and interdisciplinary research envi-
ronment, attractive employment conditions and a very
competitive salary by international standards. Full fund-
ing is available for 2 years The successful candidate will
have a PhD in developmental biology and/or neuro-

This is an exciting opportunity to understand speciation

See the links above for more details of individual
positions or contact me for more information. The
broader goals of the grant are outlined below:
The Heliconius butteries oer an excellent opportunity
to gain novel insights into the genetic architecture of
speciation and its genomic consequences, by integrat-
ing genomic data from the well-studied ecological and
behavioural processes that underlie speciation in this
group. This ERC-funded project aims to study patterns
of selection and introgression at wing patterning loci, in
order to understand the process of genome divergence
and adaptive radiation. The main goals of the wider
project are as follows:
1) Characterise patterns of genetic divergence and gene
ow along the speciation continuum. Using whole-
genome resequencing of population samples in sympatry
and allopatry, we will quantify the extent of gene ow
between hybridising taxa. Wing pattern genes provide
an example of adaptive introgression among populations
and between species.
2) Are speciation genes clustered in the genome? Spe-
ciation theory predicts clustering of barrier genes, and
we will test this by conducting the rst genome-wide
quantitative trait locus studies of reproductive isola-
tion in Heliconius, replicated in two hybridising species
pairs. Taking advantage of well-characterized ecology
and behavior, we will determine the distribution of bar-
rier genes accumulated where hybridizing species pairs
are sympatric. In particular the focus is on the role of
pheromonal signals in mate choice.
3) Are chromosomal rearrangements favoured by selec-
tion, and what is their impact on patterns of recom-
bination? Theory predicts CRs should be favoured in
association with barrier genes between sympatric species.
We will determine the presence of chromosomal rear-
rangements in both sympatric hybridising pairs andDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 147
their allopatric relatives. Recombination will also be
measured directly from crosses in both F1 and pure
species genomes, to directly determine the inuence of
CRs on recombination rate. Finally we will determine
the extent to which regions of high divergence (Goal 1)
between species are explained by the known distribution
of barrier genes (Goal 2) and patterns of recombina-
tion. This work will oer new insights into speciation, a
process fundamental to evolution and biodiversity, but
also has wider implications for our understanding of the
processes that drive genome evolution.

nonetheless candidates with experience in other elds
of ecology are also invited to apply.
*Activities*
The post-doctoral fellow will undertake research within
the long-term research program (PELD/CNPq) con-
ducted by ECGPs members in the carstic region of
Serra da Bodoquena, in Mato Grosso do Sul. This
research program hosts several projects with focus on
dierent aspects of biological dynamics associated to a
landscape gradient of habitat loss. The post-doctoral
fellow can also be involved in undergraduate and grad-
uate lecturing, laboratory instruction, tutorials, and
supervision of undergraduate projects.
*How to apply*

UFlorida CladeDenitions
TreeOfLife
We are seeking a second postdoctoral fellow to support
the Phyloreferencing project. Our ideal candidate is a
biologist by training, and has strong expertise in sys-
tematic biology. The focus of your work would be on
working with select NSF GoLife projects to develop
meaningful phyloreferences and to use these in proof-
of-concept applications for aggregating trait and other
domain-relevant data. In addition, you would work
with the ARBOR project to research integrating phy-
loreferences into trait-based analysis and visualization
workows.
The Phyloreferencing project is a collaboration between
Dr. Nico Cellinese (Florida Museum of Natural His-
tory, University of Florida) and Hilmar Lapp (Center
for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke Univer-
sity) newly funded by the National Science Foundation.
The postdoc will be based in the lab of Dr. Cellinese,
but will work closely with both PIs. Starting date is
negotiable. Salary is $50,000.
Why phyloreferencing?
The ability to freely and precisely communicate
organism-linked data suers serious limitations from
the traditionally used taxon names based in Linnaean
nomenclature. The semantics of such names are too
often ambiguous, subject to divergent interpretation,
and unavailable to computation. And with the advent
of next-generation sequencing, metagenomics, and other
modern biological data collection technologies, many
groups of organisms for which we have interesting data
do not yet, and may never have a Linnaean name.150 EvolDir December 1, 2016
Our project aims to overcome these limitations by den-
ing ontology-based references (phyloreferences) to ele-
ments on the Tree of Life that are unambiguous and the
semantics of which are amenable to powerful machine
reasoning. One of the foundations of phyloreferencing is
formed by the decades of theoretical and applied work on
phylogenetic taxonomy. Ongoing computational work
involves researching and developing OWL models and
ontologies, tools for converting existing data into OWL
format, and online proof-of-concept applications for us-
ing machine reasoning to navigate biodiversity data by
clade semantics.

You will work closely with the project PIs, existing post-
doc and graduate students to generate the major project
deliverables, focus on extending proof-of-concept tools
to data integration use-cases beyond the Open Tree of
Life project as the main phylogeny provider. Specically,
you will work with other projects funded by NSF's Go-
Life program to obtain large phylogenies, gather sources
for meaningful phyloreferences, and develop phylorefer-
encing proof-of-concept applications for these. These
applications will include aggregating trait and other
domain-relevant data. You will also work with the AR-
BOR Evolutionary Workows project to prototype ways
for integrating phyloreferences into trait-based analysis
and visualization workows that can be executed within
the ARBOR framework.
While working with us on this project, you will gain
familiarity with ontology development and ontology-
enabled applications, including generating phylorefer-
ences at a Tree-of-Life scale. You will also have the
opportunity to explore, develop and test alternative ap-
proaches to clade denitions at every taxonomic level
and at the broadest possible scales. You will have op-
portunities to publish both empirical and theoretical
work.
Qualications:
* PhD in Biology or a related eld. * Strong back-
ground in Systematic Biology required. You should be
well versed in all aspects of theoretical phylogenetics
and related topics. * Programming experience in lan-
guages frequently used in scientic computing and for
managing or converting scientic data (e.g., Python) is
useful (and thus preferred) but not required. * Excellent
communication and writing skills, and ability to interact
productively with other projects' PIs and personnel.

Start date: 01.01.2017 (or as soon as possible thereafter)
Contract: 1 year renewable (funding readily available
for 3 years)
One of the major promises of Big Data lies in the si-
multaneous mining of multiple sources of data. This
is particularly important in life sciences, where dif-
ferent and complementary data are scattered across
multiple resources. To overcome this issue, the use of
RDF/semantic web technology is emerging, but query-
ing these systems often proves to be too complex for
most users^ a e\thereby hampering wide development and
adoption of these technologies.
This project is a collaboration between bioinformaticians
from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Lausanne
and Zurich, and information system engineers at the
Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), funded
by the Swiss National Priority Programme "Big Data\.
It aims at enabling sophisticated semantic queries across
large, decentralized and heterogeneous databases via an
intuitive interface. The system will enable scientists,
without prior training, to perform powerful joint queries
across resources in ways that cannot be anticipated and
therefore goes far beyond the query functionality ofspecialized knowledge bases.
The successful candidate will be based at the University
of Lausanne, under the supervision of Prof. Christophe
Dessimoz (OMA database), Dr. Heinz Stockinger (CTO
of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), and Prof. Marc
Robinson-Rechavi (Bgee database). S/he will be respon-
sible to implement interfaces to the OMA orthology
database and Bgee gene expression database, and to
establish a catalogue of sample cross-resources queries.
The successful candidate will also have the opportunity
to gain teaching experience (e.g. via student project su-
pervision and contribution to undergraduate or graduate
teaching) and to contribute to other ongoing projects
in the host labs.
At least 50% of the regular working hours will be devoted
to personal research work.
Working conditions in Lausanne are extremely competi-
tive, and include access to state-of-the-art computing
and sequencing facilities. The environment is highly in-
ternational, and all activities are conducted in English.

ULausanne ComparativeGenomics
Postdoctoral position in comparative genomics
Universtity of Lausanne, Department of Ecology and
Evolution
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate to work
on the comparative genomics of socially polymorphic
ants. Previous work showed that social organization
in the re ant Solenopsis invicta is under the control
of a social chromosome. The aim of this project is to
reconstruct the evolutionary history of the social chro-
mosome. The same genomic region has been shown
to regulate social organization in 6 closely related re
ant species. Comparative analyses will be conducted
to characterize the gene content, putative regulatory
regions, and extent of synteny in the supergene among
species and determine the routes and mechanisms of
gene gain/loss and identify the nature of selection act-
ing on the genes in the nonrecombining region. The
proposed studies will thus permit to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of a supergene involved in mediat-
ing a major social innovation. This work is of general
signicance because there are increasing number of ex-
amples of supergenes being involved in the regulation of
important and diverse evolutionary phenomena such as
the origin of sex chromosomes, mimicry, reproductive
morphs and self-incompatibility.
The positions will be funded by a grant from the Swiss
NSF. The duration will be 1-5 years.

We are seeking a highly motivated individual to inves-
tigate how extreme temperatures impact on fertility
in Drosophila, and whether this is likely to aect how
species will respond to climate change. The thermal
limits of species have often been used to predict how
species are likely to respond to increasing global temper-
atures. These thermal limits are typically based on the
temperatures at which organisms die or lose mobility.
However, in a great many organisms, sterility occurs at
temperatures far less extreme than those required to
kill the organism. We aim to systematically investigate
the links between fatal thermal limits and the temper-
atures at which ies become infertile, across a suite of
Drosophila species.
You will join the research group of Dr Tom Price at
Liverpool, and this NERC funded project will be co-
supervised by Dr Amanda Bretman (Leeds) and Dr
Rhonda Snook (Sheeld). You will be responsible for
running laboratory experiments alongside a full-time
technician. You should have a PhD degree in Ecology,
Evolution or a related discipline, and practical experi-
ence working with invertebrates in a laboratory setting

ULyon EvolutionaryGenomics
A post-doctoral position in bioinformatics is available
in the Laboratory of Biometry and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy, at the University of Lyon, France. The selected
candidate will join the Bioinformatics, Phylogeny and
Evolutionary Genomics group and will work with Ana-
maria Necsulea on the evolution and functionality of
long non-coding RNAs in mammals. The position is
funded for 12 months (potentially renewable), starting
in January 2017.
The ideal candidate has a PhD in bioinformatics, bio-
statistics and/or genomics and has experience in the
analysis of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing
data (RNA-seq). Applications from candidates with
a Master degree will also be considered for a research
assistant position.
The selected candidate will work on the evolution and
functionality of long non-coding RNAs. It is now
well established that long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs)
transcription is pervasive in mammals. Thousands of
lncRNA transcripts are now routinely detected with
high-throughput transcriptome sequencing approaches.
However, lncRNA functionality remains an important
open question. Evolutionary approaches can bridge the
gap between the mere evidence of transcription and
lncRNA functionality, by identifying lncRNA genes that
are subject to purifying natural selection to maintain
their functional properties, or to positive selection follow-
ing the acquisition of new functions. Here, we propose
to use an evolutionary genomics and transcriptomics
approach to explore lncRNA functionality. The project

Postdoctoral Position in Fire Ecology and Pollination
Funding is available through a multi-university US-
FWS State Wildlife Grant Program to examine the
impact of prescribed re and wildower seeding on
plant-pollinator populations and interactions across the
US Southern Central Plains. The postdoctoral posi-
tion will be supported by the Jha Lab at the Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin (https://w3.biosci.utexas.edu/-
jha/) and the Baum Lab at Oklahoma State Univer-
sity (http://kabaum.wix.com/home), with residence in
Austin, Texas for the rst two years. A third year
of funding is available and contingent upon research
progress.
The postdoctoral project involves coordinating pre-
scribed burn and wildower seeding treatments to re-
store prairie systems across northern Texas and southern
Oklahoma and evaluating the impacts of these treat-
ments on native plant recovery, pollinator communities,
and pollinator foraging ecology. The project will include
one year of implementing the treatments (including pre
and post-re fuel load analyses) and two or more years
of plant and pollinator population monitoring (including
assessment of monarchs, native bees, and other species
of conservation need). The objective is to characterize
the impact of local restoration practices on plant and
pollinator communities and their interactions to inform
regional and national restoration practices.
Qualied candidates are required to have a Ph.D. in
ecology, wildlife biology, entomology, or a related eld of
study. Candidates with background in re ecology are
strongly encouraged to apply; hands-on experience with
prescribed res is especially desirable. The research
project will have a large eld component, and thus some
type of relevant eld expertise (such as prescribed re,
vegetation surveys, bee community surveys, or wildland
seeding) is required. Excellent communication skills,
including eective writing, are also required. Prior ex-
perience supervising undergraduate students, working
with landowners, and/or identifying native bees is a
plus. It is expected that the appointee will be involved
in the management of a large eld crew and the men-
toring of graduate and undergraduate students, as wellas outreach/extension activities.
This is full-time postdoctoral researcher position with
excellent benets. Interested applicants should send
(1) a letter of interest ( ~1 page) describing previous
research experience and their interests in working on
the project, (2) a CV, and (3) contact information for
three references willing to provide a recommendation.
Please send any questions regarding the position to
sjha@austin.utexas.edu (Subject line: \Postdoc posi-
tion"). To apply, go to https://utdirect.utexas.edu/-
apps/hr/jobs/nlogon/search/0/ and search for job #
16-11-16-01-0712. Review of applications will begin Dec
20th 2016, and will continue until the position is lled;
however, applications received by the deadline will be
given priority consideration.
The University of Texas at Austin is home to a vi-
brant research community, with strengths in population
and community ecology, re ecology, behavior, molecu-
lar biology, population genetics/genomics, multi-species
interactions, and evolutionary biology. Opportunities
exist to learn a range of both eld-based and lab-based
experimental techniques and to develop grant propos-
als for additional research projects. The University of
Texas at Austin is an equal opportunity employer and
is committed to providing employment opportunities

Data manipulation and visualization with Python
13-17 March 2017, Berlin (Germany)
http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course10/ In-
structor: Dr. Martin Jones
http://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/
Course overview:
One of the strengths of the Python language is the avail-
ability of mature, high-quality libraries for working with
scientic data. Integration between the most popular
libraries has led to the concept of a \scientic Python
stack": a collection of packages which are designed to
work well together. In this workshop we will see how
to leverage these libraries to eciently work with and
visualize large volumes of data.
Workshop format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at
the organizer's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
The last two sessions will be kept free for students to
work on their own datasets with the assistance of the
instructor. A description of the sessions can be found
at the bottom of this page.
Who should attend:
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a
basic knowledge of Python (if you've taken the Introduc-
tory Python course then you have the Python knowledge;
if you're not sure whether you know enough Python to
benet from this course then just drop us an email).
Requirements:
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the example datasets. Theyshould also have some basic Python experience (the
Introduction to Python course will fulll these require-
ments). Students should be familiar with the use of
lists, loops, functions and conditions in Python and
have written at least a few small programs from scratch.
Students will require the scientic Python stack to be
installed on their laptops before attending; instructions
for this will be sent out prior to the course.
Curriculum
Monday 13th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1 - Introduction and datasets
Jupyter (formerly iPython) is a programming environ-
ment that is rapidly becoming the de facto standard for
scientic data analysis. In this session we'll learn why
Jupyter is so useful, covering its ability to mix notes and
code, to render inline plots, charts and tables, to use
custom styles and to create polished web pages. We'll
also take a look at the datasets that we'll be investigat-
ing during the course and discuss the dierent types of
data we encounter in bioinformatics work.
Session 2 - Introduction to pandas
In this session we introduce the rst part of the sci-
entic Python stack: the pandas data manipulation
package. We'll learn about Dataframes the core data
structure that much of the rest of the course will rely on
and how they allow us to quickly select, sort, lter and
summarize large datasets. We'll also see how to extend
existing Dataframes by writing functions to create new
columns, as well as how to deal with common problems
like missing or inconsistent values in datasets. We'll
get our rst look at data visualization by using pandas'
built in plotting ability to investigate basic properties
of our datasets.
Tuesday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3- Grouping and pivoting with pandas
This session continues our look at pandas with advanced
uses of Dataframes that allow us to answer more com-
plicated questions. We'll look two very powerful tools:
grouping, which allows us to aggregate information in
datasets, and pivoting/stacking, which allows us to ex-
ibly rearrange data (a key step in preparing datasets
for visualization). In this session we'll also go into more
detail about pandas indexing system.
Session 4- Advanced manipulation with pandas158 EvolDir December 1, 2016
In this nal session on the pandas library we'll look at
a few common types of data manipulation binning data
(very useful for working with time series), carrying out
principal component analysis, and creating networks.
We'll also cover some features of pandas designed for
working with specic types of data like timestamps and
ordered categories.
Wednesday 15th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 5-Introduction to seaborn
This session introduces the seaborn charting library by
showing how we can use it to investigate relationships
between dierent variables in our datasets. Initially we
concentrate on showing distributions with histograms,
scatter plots and regressions, as well as a few more ex-
otic chart types like hexbins and KDE plots. We also
cover heatmaps, in particular looking at how they lend
themselves to displaying the type of aggregate data that
we can generate with pandas.

Berlin EukaryoticMetabarcoding
Feb20-24 2
Dear all,
we still have a few places available on our
next Eukaryotic-metabarcoding workshop: http://-
www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course4/ http://-
www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course4/ This course
is being delivered by Dr. Owen S. Wangensteen, an ex-
pert in the application of molecular techniques to the
study of marine ecological issues and biodiversity as-
sessment of marine benthic ecosystems, including high-
throughput sequencing and bioinformatics. He is cur-
rently working at the University of Salford (UK), actively
participating on the development of new metabarcoding
techniques for the assessment of biodiversity in the ma-
rine realm (both in benthic and seawater samples), as a
member of Project SeaDNA (NERC, UK). The course
will run from Monday 20th to Friday 24th February
2017 in Berlin, Germany.
Overview:Metabarcoding techniques are a set of novel genetic
tools for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing bio-
diversity of natural communities. Their potential appli-
cations include (but are not limited to) accurate water
quality, soil diversity assessment, trophic analyses of
digestive contents, diagnosis of health status of sh-
eries, early detection of non-indigenous species, studies
of global ecological patterns and biomonitoring of an-
thropogenic impacts. This workshop gives an overview
of metabarcoding procedures with an emphasis on prac-
tical problem-solving and hands-on work using analysis
pipelines on real datasets. After completing the work-
shop, students should be in a position to (1) understand
the potential and capabilities of metabarcoding, (2) run
complete analyses of metabarcoding pipelines and ob-
tain diversity inventories and ecologically interpretable
data from raw next-generation sequence data and (3)
design their own metabarcoding projects, using bespoke
primer sets and custom reference databases. All course
materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared by
the instructing team) will be provided electronically to
participants.
Intended audience:
This workshop is mainly aimed at researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in ecology, biodiversity or
community biology who want to use molecular tools for
biodiversity research and at researchers in other areas of
bioinformatics who want to learn ecological applications
for biodiversity-assessment. In general, it is suitable for
every researcher who wants to join the growing com-
munity of metabarcoders worldwide. This workshop
will review mostly techniques and software useful for eu-
karyotic metabarcoding. Another workshop focused on
procedures currently used in microbial metabarcoding
will be available from Physalia-courses.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours
of practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's
discretion.
Assumed background:
No programming or scripting experience is necessary,
but some previous expertise using the Linux console
and/or R will be most welcome. All examples will be
run in a Linux environment. Thus, either a Linux PC
or a virtual box running Linux under Windows or Mac
environment will be needed. MacOSX systems might
be OK, although installation of some additional Python
packages might be needed in that case. The syllabusDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 159
has been planned for people which have some previ-
ous experience running simple commands in Linux and
using the R environment (preferently RStudio) for per-
forming basic plots and statistical procedures. You will
need to have a laptop with Python 2.7 installed for
running OBITools, the main metabarcoding software
package we will be using during the course, but no ex-
perience with Python is necessary. If in doubt, take a
look at the detailed session content below or contact Dr.
Owen S. Wangensteen (owenwangensteen@gmail.com
mailto:owenwangensteen@gmail.com ).
Course programme:
Monday 20th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1. Introduction to metabarcoding procedures.
The metabarcoding pipeline.
In this session students will be introduced to the key con-
cepts of metabarcoding and the dierent next-generation
sequencing platforms currently available for implement-
ing this technology. The kind of results that we may
obtain from metabarcoding projects is explained using
examples from real life. I will outline the dierent steps
of a typical metabarcoding pipeline which will be fur-
ther reviewed along the course. I will also explain the
format of the course. In this session, we will check
that the computing infrastructure for the rest of the
course is in place and all the needed software is installed.
Core concepts introduced: next-generation sequencer,
multiplexing, NGS library,

Teaching format: The workshop is delivered over ten
half-day sessions (see the detailed curriculum below).
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organizer's discretion. There will also be plenty
of time for students to discuss their own problems and
data.
Assumed background: Students should have enough
biological background to appreciate the examples and
exercise problems (i.e. they should know about DNA
and protein sequences, what translation is, and what
introns and exons are). No previous programming ex-
perience or computer skills (beyond the ability to use
a text editor) are necessary, but you'll need to have a
laptop with Python installed.

GIS analysis with QGIS for biologists From Monday
6th to Friday 10th February 2017 in Berlin, Germany
http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course5/ In-
structors: Dr Paolo Cavallini and Matteo Ghetta
Overview QGIS is the most popular and reliable Open
Source GIS in the world. QGIS is currently used in
Universities, Public Facilities and private oces. Born
in 2002 as a simple layer viewer in the last 5 year more
than 200 developers all over the world contributes to the
source code making QGIS the standard of the GIS. The
course is intended for biologists with no experience of
GIS but also for those who want to switch from another
GIS software to QGIS. The course will be focused on
practical examples so that the students will be able
to load and process their own data and perform both
simple and complex spatial analysis.
Course materials (example data, presentations, addi-
tional les) will be provided to participants.
Intended audience Students and researchers with abso-
lutely no GIS experience will learn the basic GIS system
concepts and will be able to work alone with QGIS.
However, people with both GIS concept and QGIS expe-
rience will enjoy the course. Furthermore, the course is
useful to all of those people who want to migrate from
another GIS software (ArcMap, gvSIG, GRASS, etc..)
to QGIS.
Teaching format The course is 5 full-day long. The rst
day a small presentation of GIS concept will be shown.
The other days practical examples and guided exercises
will be provided.
Assumed Background Biologists can have absolutely
no GIS (or QGIS) experience. GIS experts that want
refresh some GIS concept or want to discover hidden162 EvolDir December 1, 2016

Feb6-10
We still have a few places available on our next Advanced
Python for biologists workshop - full details below
http://www.prstatistics.com/course/advanced-python-
biologists-apyb01/ This course is being delivered by Dr
Martin Jones, an expert in Python and author of two
text books,
Python for Biologists [http://www.amazon.com/-
Python-Biologists-complete- programming-
beginners/dp/1492346136/]
Advanced Python for Biologists [http://-
www.amazon.com/Advanced-Python- Biologists-
Martin-Jones/dp/1495244377/].
This course will run from 6th 10th February 2017 at
Flatford Mill eld centre, Suolk, England
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a basic knowl-
edge of Python.
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks
at the organizers discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so its important that students attend all sessions.
A description of the sessions can be found under pro-
gramme.
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein ac-
cession number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence
is).
Curriculum:
Day 1:December 1, 2016 EvolDir 163
Session 1 Data structures in Python In this session we
will briey recap Pythons basic data structures, before
looking at a couple of new data types tuples and sets
and discussing where each should be used. We will then
see how we can combine these basic types to make more
complex data structures for solving specic problems.
Well nish our discussion by looking at specialized data
types that are found in the Python core library. This
session will also be our rst introduction to benchmark-
ing as we talk about the relative performance of dierent
data types. In the practical session well learn how to
parse an input le into a complex data structure which
we can then use to rapidly query the data. Core concepts
introduced: tuples, sets, higher-order data structures,
default dicts, Counters, big-O notation.
Session 2 Recursion and trees In this session we will
cover two very closely related concepts: trees (i.e. the
various ways that we can store hierarchical data) and
recursive functions (the best way to operate on treelike
data). As recursion is inherently confusing, well start
with a gentle introduction using biological examples
before moving on to consider a number of core tree
algorithms concerning parents, children, and common
ancestors. In the practical session well look in detail
at one particular way of identifying the last common
ancestor of a group of nodes, which will give us an op-
portunity to explore the role of recursion. Core concepts
introduced: nested lists, storing hierarchical data, re-
cursive functions, relationship between recursion and
iteration.
Day 2:
Session 3 Classes and objects In this session we will intro-
duce the core concepts of object-oriented programming,
and see how the data types that we use all the time in
Python are actually examples of classes. Well take a
very simple example and use it to examine how we can
construct our own classes, moving from an imperative
style of programming to an object-oriented style. As we
do so, well discuss where and when object-orientation
is a good idea. In the practical we will practise writing
classes to solve simple biological problems and famil-
iarize ourselves with the division of code into library
and client that object-oriented programming demands.
Core concepts introduced: classes, instances, methods
vs. functions, self, constructors, magic methods.
Session 4 Object-oriented programming Following on
from the previous session, we will go over some advanced
ideas that are common to most object-oriented program-
ming languages. For each idea well discuss the basic
concept, the scenarios in which its useful, and the de-
tails of how it works in Python. This overview will also
allow us to consider the challenges involved in designingobject-oriented code. In the practical we will work on
a simulation which will involve multiple classes work-
ing together. Core concepts introduced: inheritance
and class hierarchies, method overriding, superclasses
and subclasses, polymorphism, composition, multiple
inheritance.
Day 3:
Session 5 Functional programming in Python This ses-
sion will start with a look at a few dierent concepts that
are important in functional programming, culminating
in a discussion of the idea of state and its role in pro-
gram design. We will see how functional programming
is, in many ways, the complement of object-oriented

EMBO Practical Course: http://events.embo.org/17-
phylogenetics Tree building: Advanced concepts and
practice of phylogenetic analysis
24 - 29 April 2017, Faro, Portugal
*About the practical course*
The use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of molecular sequences is a vital
part of biological research. These methods underpin
studies on the evolution and epidemiology of plant and
animal parasites and disease-causing organisms, and
more generally they allow an objective analysis of the
patterns and processes generating biological diversity.
To carry out phylogenetic analysis properly, it is neces-
sary to have a good understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the key methods and approaches. This
EMBO Practical Course has been designed to provide
the theoretical and practical skills needed to carry out
state-of-the-art phylogenetic analyses.
The past few years have seen have an explosion in
new methods of analysis including the application of
Bayesian analysis methods in phylogeny reconstruction,164 EvolDir December 1, 2016
the development of improved non-homogeneous models
that much better represent the dynamics of sequence
evolution, and the development of methods for high-
throughput genome-wide analyses. This EMBO Practi-
cal Course has been designed to cater for these newest
of methods and for understanding how they relate to
the more traditional methods. Our goal is to teach
technical sophistication without losing sight of the need
for a critical attitude to data and analyses.

MaxPlanckInst EvolBio Zoonoses

The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology and
the Robert Koch Institute are organizing the workshop
*One Past Health*
- Understanding past zoonotic events to predict future
ones -
from February 15th to 17th, 2017, at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Ploen/Germany.
http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/OnePastHealth This work-
shop aims to foster the interdisciplinary dialog between
medical, veterinary and biological sciences, bringing to-
gether empirical and theoretical researchers interested
in disease ecology, epidemiology, host-pathogen coevolu-
tion, paleogenomics, and more. The resulting interac-
tions will promote interdisciplinary scientic progress
and may ultimately help uncovering ways to prevent
future zoonotic events.
Synopsis: Many infectious diseases that are of high
public health relevance today nd their roots in past
zoonotic events, e.g. the HIV-1 pandemics. Similarly,
for these infectious diseases involving recurrent transmis-
sion from zoonotic reservoirs, most transmission events
lie in the past, e.g. the historical pandemics of Yersinia
pestis. These past events are an immense, precious
and underexplored record of the processes leading to
zoonotic emergence.
We have some tools to indirectly frame the context of
zoonotic events. Historical outbreak records are such a
tool but unfortunately often reveal a very unclear source
of information. Over the last 2 decades, we took advan-
tage of major advances in molecular biology, statistics
and computational sciences to leverage the power of a
natural record of the evolutionary history: the genetic di-
versity of present-day pathogens. This information was
used to determine the origin in time and space as well
as the later spread of Ebola viruses or HIV-1. But what
if we could travel back in time and observe what really
happened? We could then directly test the hypotheses
we derive from present-day genetic diversity and catch
evolution red-handed at crucial steps of the emergence
process. Ancient DNA (aDNA) approaches are now
ripe to simultaneously investigate the evolution of manypathogens (including zoonotic ones) and the evolution of
the immune system of their hosts. This maturity nicely
coincides with the development of modeling frameworks
that allow us to make the most of heterochronous data
and to describe individual pathogen trajectories in the
context of the microbial communities they belong to.

Geometric Morphometrics Using R (GMMR01)
This course is being delivered by Prof. Dean Adams,
Prof. Michael Collyer and Dr. Antigoni Kaliont-
zopoulou
This course will run from 5th - 9th June 2017 at Millport
Field centre on the Isle of Cumbre, Scotland. Please
note that although the course is held on an island it
is extremely accessible and easy to reach using public
transport.
The eld of geometric morphometrics (GM) is concerned
with the quantication and analysis of patterns of shape
variation, and its covariation with other variables. Over
the past several decades these approaches have become
a mainstay in the eld of ecology, evolutionary biology,
and anthropology, and a panoply of analytical tools
for addressing specic biological hypotheses concern-
ing shape have been developed. The goal of this is to
provide participants with a working knowledge of the
theory of geometric morphometrics, as well as practical
training in the application of these methods.
The course is organized in both theoretical and practical
sessions. The theoretical sessions will provide a compre-
hensive introduction to the methods of landmark-based
geometric morphometrics, which aims at providing theDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 167
participants with a solid theoretical background for un-
derstanding the procedures used in shape data analysis.
Practical sessions will include worked examples, giving
the participants the opportunity to gain hands-on ex-
perience in the treatment of shape data using the R
package geomorph. These sessions focus on the gener-
ation of shape variables from primary landmark data,
the statistical treatment of shape variation with respect
to biological hypotheses, and the visualization of pat-
terns of shape variation and of the shapes themselves
for interpretation of statistical ndings, using the R
language for statistical programming. While practice
datasets will be available, it is strongly recommended
that participants come with their own datasets.
Note: Because this is a geometric morphometrics work-
shop in R, it is required that participants have some
working knowledge in R. The practical sessions of the
course will focus on GM-based analyses, and not basic
R user-interfacing. It is therefore strongly recommended
that participants refresh their R skills prior to attending
the workshop.
Course cost is 520 for students and academic sta and
630 for people working in industry. Accommodation
package available for 275, includes all meals and refresh-
ments.

introduction- python-biologists
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at complete beginners and as-
sumes no prior programming experience. It gives an
overview of the language with an emphasis on practical
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn
from various aspects of bioinformatics work. The work-
shop is structured so that the parts of the language most
useful for bioinformatics are introduced as early as possi-
ble, and that students can start writing plausibly-useful
programs after the rst few sessions. After completing
the workshop, students should be in a position to (1)
apply the skills they have learned to tackling problems
in their own research and (2) continue their Python
education in a self-directed way.
\Great learning from someone with a biology background
rather than computer science - meant we were on the
same wavelength." (February 2016) \Brilliantly well-
run. From the book; to the USB stick with all the les
we need; to the topics covered; to the system of helping
us one-on-one, I cannot fault this course." (February
2016)

Bert Overduin (Training and Outreach Bioinformatician,
Edinburgh Genomics)
WORKSHOP FORMAT
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions.
Each session consists of roughly a one hour lecture fol-
lowed by two hours of practical exercises, with breaks at
the organiser's discretion. Each session uses examples
and exercises that build on material from the previous
one, so it's important that students attend all sessions.
A description of the sessions can be found at the bottom
of this page.
WHO SHOULD ATTEND
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology who want to
learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. If in doubt,
take a look at the detailed session content below or drop
Martin Jones or Bert Overduinan email.
REQUIREMENTS
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein acces-
sion number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence is).
No previous programming experience or computer skillsDecember 1, 2016 EvolDir 169
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary.
SESSION CONTENT
1. Introduction
In this session I introduce the students to Python and
explain what we expect them to get out of it and how
learning to program can benet their research. I explain
the format of the course and take care of any housekeep-
ing details (like coee breaks and catering arrangements).
I outline the edit-run-x cycle of software development
and talk about how to avoid common text editing er-
rors. In this session, we also check that the computing
infrastructure for the rest of the course is in place (e.g.
making sure that everybody has an appropriate version
of Python installed). Core concepts introduced: source
code, text editors, whitespace, syntax and syntax errors,
Python versions
2. Manipulating text
In this session students learn to write very simple pro-
grams that produce output to the terminal, and in doing
so become comfortable with editing and running Python
code. This session also introduces many of the technical
terms that we'll rely on in future sessions. I run through
some examples of tools for working with text and show
how they work in the context of biological sequence
manipulation. We also cover dierent types of errors
and error messages, and learn how to go about xing
them methodically. Core concepts introduced: termi-
nals, standard output, variables and naming, strings
and characters, special characters, output formatting,
statements, functions, methods, arguments, comments.
3. Working with les
I introduce this session by talking about the importance
of les in bioinformatics pipelines and workows, and
we then explore the Python interfaces for reading from
and writing to les. This involves introducing the idea
of types and objects, and a bit of discussion about how

Winter School - Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics
(B@G3 2017)DATE: February 5-11, 2017
Reminder for the Winter School of Bioinformatics for
Adaptation Genomics. The registration deadline is ap-
proaching fast. Applications need to be submitted by
November 20th 2016.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The application of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to non-model
organisms is now well-established and has unlocked new
frontiers for research on adaptation genomics. Despite
recent technological developments enabling an increas-
ing number of projects to use genome-scale data, the
analysis of such complex data sets still raises substan-
tial hurdles for researchers with primarily a biological
background. Bioinformatic pipelines oer an invaluable
resource to process genomic data, but their underlying
rationale often remains hard to understand, which poses
signicant challenges for their rigorous use and for the
accurate interpretation of the results. The B@G Win-
ter School provides an opportunity for researchers to
penetrate the 'black box' behind the complex bioinfor-
matics approaches available for investigating adaptation
genomics throughout the analytical pipeline; from the
programs and assumptions necessary to produce a high
quality SNP dataset to the in-depth interpretation of
methods designed to address key evolutionary questions.
B@G teachers are established scientists with a primary
role in the development of widely used bioinformatic
software, and will provide insights into the foundations
of the algorithms and suggest best practice in experi-
mental design and analysis.
AUDIENCE The School is primarily aimed at evolu-
tionary biologists and bioinformaticians who want to
gain deeper knowledge on state-of-the-art methods used
to detect evolutionary patterns from genome-wide nu-
cleotide data. Applications from early career researchers
(PhD and post-doctoral level), as well as faculty with a
background in ecology, genetics, or bioinformatics, will
be considered. The workshop is particularly aimed at
candidates with experience of the Unix environment and
with preliminary knowledge on analytical pipelines for
genomic data.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch).
COST Total fee for participants is 750.- CHF. This in-
cludes tuition and accommodation in double rooms with
full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
at the Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop. A
limited number of single rooms may be available upon
request at an additional fee of 300.- CHF.
REGISTRATION The workshop will be limited to 30December 1, 2016 EvolDir 171
participants. We ask that all interested participants
submit a cover letter (1 page max) detailing their re-
search interests, their level of bioinformatics experience,
and motivation for attending the workshop, as well as
their CV (2 pages max) to BioinfAdapt@env.ethz.ch by
November 20th 2016. Participants will be notied of
the outcome of the selection process by December 5th
2016.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.172 EvolDir December 1, 2016
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
