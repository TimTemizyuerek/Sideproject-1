2010 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation
(CEC) Special Session on Evolutionary Robotics
Barcelona, Spain. July 18-23, 2010
*CALL FOR PAPERS*
*Organisers:*
Patricia A. Vargas (Heriot-Watt University - Edin-
burgh) Steﬀen Wischmann (EPFL - Lausanne) Dario
Floreano (EPFL - Lausanne) Phil Husbands (Univer-
sity of Sussex - Brighton)
Website: http://lis.epﬂ.ch/specialsessions/CEC10/
*Scope:*
Evolutionary Robotics (ER) aims to apply evolutionary
computation techniques, inspired by darwinian selec-
tion, to automatically design the control and/or hard-
ware of both real and simulated autonomous robots.
Having an intrinsic interdisciplinary character, ER is
being employed towards the development of many ﬁelds
of research, among which we can highlight neuroscience,cognitive science, evolutionary biology and robotics.
Hence the objective of this special session is to as-
semble a set of high-quality original contributions that
reﬂect and advance the state-of-the-art in the area of
Evolutionary Robotics, with an emphasis on the cross-
fertilization between ER and the aforementioned re-
search areas, ranging from theoretical analysis to real-
life applications.
Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):
- Evolution of robots which display minimal cognitive
behaviour, learning, memory, spatial cognition, adap-
tation or homeostasis. - Evolution of neural controllers
for robots, aimed at giving an insight to neuroscientists
or advancing control structures. - Evolution of commu-
nication, cooperation and competition, using robots as
a research platform. - Co-evolution and the evolution
of collective behaviour. - Evolution of morphology in
close interaction with the environment, giving rise to
self-reconﬁgurable, self-designing, self-healing and self-
reproducing robots. - Evolution of robot systems aimed
at real-world applications as in aerial robotics, space
exploration, industry, search and rescue, robot com-
panions, entertainment and games. - Evolution of con-
trollers on board real robots or the real’time evolution
of robot hardware. - Novel or improved algorithms for
the evolution or robot systems. - The use of evolutionFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 3
for the artistic exploration of robot design.
*Important Dates:*
Paper Submission: January 31, 2010 Notiﬁcation of Ac-
ceptance: March 15, 2010 Camera-Ready Submission:

XVI International Congress of the IUSSI
The organizing committee takes great pleasure in
inviting you to participate in the XVI International
Congress of the International Union for the Study of
Social Insects (IUSSI), to be held in Copenhagen, Den-
mark from 8 to 14 August 2010.
Over the years social insect research has made very sig-
niﬁcant contributions to the biological sciences in gen-4 EvolDir February 1, 2010
eral and to evolutionary biology in particular, because
insect societies allow researchers to address questions
of general signiﬁcance. In many ways, social insects
have become “model systems” and the distinction be-
tween them and other biological models has become
blurred. Advanced social behaviours have been dis-
covered in other groups of organisms and the known
genomes of other, non-social insects have turned out to
be crucial for understanding the many parallel develop-
ments towards the evolution of social life. In practice
the Union’s proﬁle has therefore been broadened to the
study of social Interactions and their evolution. Social
insects are prime model systems but no longer exclusive
ones.
Registration and submission of abstracts is open!

Dear colleagues and friends,
We are pleased to invite you to the DGC Meeting 2010.
The Daphnia Genomics Consortium (DGC) is an inter-
national network of scientists with a common goal to
foster the freshwater crustacean Daphnia as a premier
model system for genomics in ecology, evolution and
the environmental sciences.
This meeting aims to bring together the members of
the consortium at large, to facilitate the exchange of in-
formation on recent developments and results obtained
from the ongoing investigations into the genome biol-
ogy of Daphnia. Additionally, we welcome researchers
working with Daphnia who are not yet DGC partici-
pants and researchers working with other model or non-
model organisms in the ﬁeld of ecological genomics.
The DGC meeting will have a signiﬁcant impact on the
future development of the research groups involved in
the consortium. By this time, we will have ﬁnalized our
initial investigations of the draft D. pulex genome se-
quence, and we will begin the work of exploring data ob-
tained from the D. magna genome sequencing project.
This upcoming meeting continues the tradition of also
promoting collaborations between researchers working
within related disciplines, including limnology, ecotox-
icology, quantitative and population genetics, system-
atics, molecular biology and evolution, developmental
biology, genomics and bioinformatics.
The meeting will have plenary lectures from keynote
speakers in several research ﬁelds related to Daphnia
and other model organisms.
Our keynote speakers are: John Colbourne (Indi-
ana University ) Donald Gilbert (Indiana University)
Joseph Shaw (Indiana University) Dieter Ebert (Uni-
versit¨ at Basel) Amanda Callaghan (University of Read-
ing) Michael Pfrender (University of Notre Dame)
Christian Laforsch (Ludwig-Maximilians Universit¨ at
M¨ unchen) Jean-Christophe Simon(Inra France) Denis
Tagu (Inra France) Abraham Tucker (Indiana Univer-
sity) Kelley Thomas ( University of New Hampshire)
John Manak (The University of Iowa) Ralph Pirow
(University of M¨ unster)
The symposia of our meeting will touch on several re-search topics:
* Ecology and Evolutionary Genomics * Toxicology and
Environmental Genomics of Natural and Human Stres-
sors * Genotype by Environment Interactions * Com-
parative Genomics and Development * Gene Expression
and Gene Function
Plan to also learn about the latest open source bioin-
formatic and high-throughput research tools, includ-
ing databases, expression and genotyping microarrays,
mapping panels for trait locus mapping, molecular ge-
netic protocols and services.
The venue is at the ﬁve century-old Katholieke Uni-
versiteit Leuven, in Belgium. Leuven is a beautiful me-
dieval town that combines a rich historical patrimonium
with a cheerful, ﬂourishing city culture and a creative
atmosphere for lively exchanges and debates.
We look forward to welcoming you in Leuven.

tion Accelerate the Evolution of Laterally Transferred
Genes?” and the Association for the Study of Biology
Evolution has found very interesting and we would like
you to share your knowledge in an international meet-
ing.
Unfortunately, we are not in a ﬁnancial position to in-
vite you, but we did our best to charge the partici-
pants as little as possible. The purpose is not to make
money but that research in Evolutionary Biology makes
progress by sharing thoughts and works.
The following subjects will be discussed: - Evolution-
ary biology concepts and modelisations for biological
annotation; - Biodiversity and Systematics; - Compar-
ative genomics and post-genomics (at all taxonomic lev-
els); - Functional phylogeny; - Environment and biolog-
ical evolution; - Origin of Life and exobiology; - Non-
adaptative versus adaptative evolution; - The /lessmuchmi-
nor/greatermuchphyla: their usefulness in evolutionary biology
knowledge.
It would be great if you could participate this year to
the Evolutionary Biology Meeting in order to present
your work and results.
Please, do not hesitate to visit our website to

Montpellier DispersalEvolution
Jun13-18
Dear all,
The deadline for the submission of oral contributions to
the symposium on dispersal evolution is coming soon
(January 15, 2010).
The FSD2010 meeting will take place from the 13th to
the 18th of June 2010 at the Congress Center, Corum in
Montpellier, France ( http://www.fsd2010.org ). This is
the 5th International Symposium / Workshop on seed
dispersal after those held in Mexico (1985-1990), Brazil
(2000) and Australia (2005). It is therefore a major sci-
entiﬁc event regarding the role and the importance of
seed dispersal by animals or other modes of abiotic dis-
semination on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
The aim of this scientiﬁc event is to facilitate inter-
actions and discussions between ecologists around the
world interested in seed dispersal at large.
We propose a symposium entitled “Evolution of dis-
persal”. Dispersal is a ubiquitous trait in living organ-
isms. In plants, adaptations to dispersal are highly di-
versiﬁed, from passive dispersal of seeds to active seed
dispersal involving highly complex chemical or visual
signals designed to attract dispersing agents. Despite
the great diversity of adaptations, only a few selection
pressures favor the evolution of dispersal. The cost of
dispersal structures or the increased mortality risk that
organisms face during the dispersal phase select against
dispersal. In contrast, competition between relatives or
temporal variability of the environment generally fa-
vors dispersal. Since the recent development of tools
in population biology (molecular markers, methods for
analyzing demographic data, etc), it is now possible to
better characterize the features of dispersal and to infer
the drivers of its evolution. Variations in selective pres-
sures arising from global changes, such as habitat frag-
mentation or the spread of a new species in a new geo-
graphic area provide exciting opportunities for studyingFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 9
the evolution of dispersal in a context where ecological
and evolutionary drivers are more easily identiﬁed. Our
symposium aims at presenting the state of the art in
this topic in order to discuss emergent research themes
based on both theoretical and experimental studies.

Ultra-conservation from the standpoint of genome in-
tegrity: from copy-counting to meiotic gene silencing.
OIST Summer School and Workshop: Quantitative
Evolutionary and Comparative Genomics 2010
The theme of the 2010 Summer School is the phe-
nomenon of strong (or extreme) sequence conservation,
which will be explored from a quantitative and mul-
tidisciplinary perspective, and connections forged with
parts of biology outside of genomics.
We are looking for a set of participants with a broad
range of backgrounds, experimentalist and theorist: for
example, biology, chemistry, computer science, ecol-
ogy, engineering, evolution, genomics, mathematics,
medicine, or physics. The essential prerequisite is an
enthusiasm to overcome traditional boundaries of your
own ﬁeld of specialization.
Sequence conservation forms the basis of comparative
genomics, has already played a pivotal role in biology
and medicine, and is likely to become increasingly im-
portant in the eras of abundant sequence data and the
personalized genome. Ultra-conservation has led to a
broad appreciation of the need for a reevaluation of
how the action of selection is inferred from sequence
comparison. It has raised basic questions about the
character of “neutral drift,” calling for new quantita-
tive developments that may be facilitated by the cul-
tures of mathematics, physics, computer science, and
engineering; however, this pursuit - and the interpreta-
tion of genome sequence in general - ought to be ﬁrmly
grounded in its biological context.
With a multitude of whole-genome sequences now pub-
licly available, ultra-conservation is trivial to exhibit,
but so far diﬃcult to explain. Therefore it represents an
ideal topic for a combined Summer School and Work-
shop, where the phenomenon can be appreciated by
participants of diverse backgrounds, who can then bring
their own perspectives to bear on the problem.
Broad Topic Categories:
* Ultra-conservation: Theory & Experiment. * Ultra-
conserved Elements (UCEs) within Populations. *
Comparative, Evolutionary and Population Genomics.
* Recombination and Genome Rearrangement. * Neu-
tral and Adaptive Evolution: Proteins, RNA, Regula-
tory Sequences, Genomes. * Experimental Evolution.
The format of the summer school consists of a three-
hour presentation in the morning, with coﬀee breaks,
followed by an hour or two of discussion in the after-
noon. The summer school is aimed primarily at in-
troducing approximately forty students and post-docs
with quantitative backgrounds - not necessarily in biol-ogy - to the splitting edge of contemporary comparative
and evolutionary genomics research. As such, tutorials
will be oﬀered to get participants with less-developed
quantitative skills or sparse biological background up to
speed insofar as possible; however, we hope that pre-
sentations will be intense and self-contained.
Okinawa is a subtropical divers’ paradise of diverse ecol-
ogy and distinctive beauty and cultural ﬂavor.
OIST provides summer school students with accom-
modation at Seaside House and ﬁnancial support for
their travel. Students will be selected competitively
based upon their completed Applications, submitted by
February 15, 2010 to qecg2010#oist.jp (replacing the

Undergraduate Diversity at the Evolution meetings
2010
We are pleased to announce a NSF-funded program
for bringing talented and diverse undergraduates to the
Evolution meetings this June 25-29 in Portland, Ore-
gon. For the eighth year in a row we will ﬂy a co-
hort of 25 undergraduates from throughout the US and
Puerto Rico to present a poster at the meetings, re-
ceive mentoring from graduate students, postdocs and
faculty, and participate in the Diversity Social as well
as a career-oriented ’Undergraduate Futures in Evolu-
tionary Biology’ panel and discussion. The program
covers the costs of travel, registration, food and accom-
modation at the meetings. The application deadline is
1 March, but admissions will be reviewed as they are
received, and so the earlier you apply, the better. Ap-
plications are welcomed from all undergraduates, and
the admissions goal is to create a diverse pool of stu-
dents. In past years we have received fewer applications
than we can fund, so we encourage you to send in an
application! An overview of the program and student
eligibility can be found at:
http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/edwards/-
community/application.html The online application
process is being handled by NESCent and can be found
at:
http://www.nescent.org/eog/-
signup evolution2010diversity.php Applications
consist of a short statement of interest, a letter of
recommendation and the title and abstract of the
poster to be presented.
In addition, we will be soliciting names of graduate
students, postdocs and faculty members who would
like to serve as mentors during the meetings. Men-
tors take pairs of students and attend talks with them,
introduce them to colleagues, network and generally
make the meetings a welcoming place for them. Al-
though costs are not covered for mentors it is an un-
usually rewarding experience. Contact Richard Kliman
<rmkliman@cedarcrest.edu >if you are interested in
serving as a mentor.

nized by the Centre Conservation Biology at the Nor-
wegian University for Science and Technology (NTNU)
and is part of the 250th Anniversary of the Royal Nor-
wegian Society of Sciences and Letters.
The goal of the conference is to:- Present the scientiﬁc basis for a sustainable conserva-
tion of natural resources.
- Focus on the process of extinction and management
actions that can increase the lifetime of populations at
the local and regional level.
- Identify common principles for a sustainable manage-
ment that also can ensure conservation.

The conference will bring leading researchers from
around the world to present and discuss the scientiﬁc
basis for a sustainable conservation of natural resources.
In particular, we will focus on the process of extinction
and management actions that can increase the lifetime
of populations both at the local and regional level. A
central goal for the conference will be to identify com-
mon principles for a sustainable management that also
can ensure conservation.
The conference will be composed of four plenary talks
that will provide a general overview of some broader
issues related to sustainable conservations and four
sessions which include talks of invited speakers, con-
tributed talks and posters.
The ﬁrst session will provide some general overviews of
why conserving biodiversity. We will examine scientiﬁc
evidence for system eﬀects on changes in the biodiver-
sity at the genetic, population and species level.
The second session will consider the ﬁve major threats
for the Earth’s biodiversity: habitat degradation and14 EvolDir February 1, 2010
fragmentation, climate change, introduction of alien
species, pollution and over-exploitation. Our aim will
be to present key-studies that give quantitative exam-
ples on how these drivers aﬀect biodiversity at the ge-
netic, population and/or ecosystem level.
Session 3 will deal with development of eﬀective tools
for predicting changes in biodiversity. In this section we
will focus on how models can be used to predict changes
in species composition or population viability, and how
parameterization of these models often will require in-
terdisciplinary collaboration between biology, mathe-
matical and social sciences. We will focus on carefully
selected model studies, which can be used as examples
for such integration among diﬀerent disciplines.
In the last section we will review practical examples in
which management of biodiversity is based on princi-
ples integrating cross-disciplinary collaboration, where
we will emphasize studies in which conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity are based on a science-
based integrated approach unifying diﬀerent science
disciplines.
The program will include a mixture of talks by invited
speakers and contributed talks by participants. In ad-
dition, there will be a poster session.

PhD fellowship in Spider systematics and evolution at
University of Barcelona
A four-year Phd fellowship is available through the FPI
program of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innova-
tion, funded as part of the research project ’The ecosys-
tem watchers: Mygalomorph spiders as bioindicators
for monitoring ecological changes and evolutionary po-
tential of terrestrial ecosystems’
Mygalomorph spiders are exceptionally well-suited for
monitoring conservation status of terrestrial ecosys-
tems in the Meditteranean basin. They exhibit high
habitat ﬁdelity, limited potential for dispersal and
restricted distributional ranges, and are abundantly
present in most Mediterranean habitats. Biologists,
however, have long overlooked mygalomorph spiders
due to their secretive habits and challenging taxonomy.The promising use of these spiders as bioindicators is
therefore not fully developed. We propose to overcome
these limitations by integrating genomic tools with eco-
logical modelling techniques. We anticipate that results
of our research will be relevant for conservation, man-
agement, and sustainable use of natural landscapes in
the Mediterranean basin.
The post will be based at the Biodiversity Research In-
stitute of the University of Barcelona. For additional
information about the research group and the project
visit www.marnedo.net We look for a highly moti-
vated student with an interest in evolutionary biology
and experience in molecular biology tools, taxonomy or
GIS techniques. Candidates must have excellent oral
and written communication skills, and demonstrate ev-
idence of past research achievement. The anticipated
start date is fall 2010.
Potential candidates should contact Miquel A. Arnedo
(marnedo@ub.edu) and include their curriculum vitae
and a statement of research interests.
For details, conditions and instructions on how to ap-
ply, please visit http://web.micinn.es/planidi/fpi/ (in

MarineBacteriaPhylogenomics
A position for a PhD student in bioinformatics is avail-
able in the Department of Microbiology at the Ger-
man Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
(DSMZ) in Braunschweig, Germany. The project is
entitled ’Phylogenomics And Functional Genomics of
The Roseobacter Clade’ and part of the recently es-
tablished Transregional Collaborative Research Centre
– Special Research Field ’Roseobacter’ funded by the
German Research Foundation (DFG).
The Roseobacter clade is one of the most abundant
and successful groups of non-obligately phototrophic
prokaryotes in the marine environment. The major goal
of the Special Research Field is the understanding of
evolutionary, genetic and physiological principles which
constitute the secret of success for these bacteria. Con-
sequently, marine microbial ecologists, bacterial physi-
ologists, biochemists, natural product chemists, geneti-
cists and computer scientists from Braunschweig and
Oldenburg join forces to investigate the Roseobacter
clade from the ecosystem level down to systems bi-
ology of model organisms with respect to important
metabolic processes.
The candidate’s tasks include the implementation of
a software pipeline for the phylogenomic analysis of
completely sequenced genomes and its application to
members of the Roseobacter clade. Particular empha-
sis will be laid on devising and assessing programs for
species delimitation and phylogenetic reconstruction di-
rectly based on whole genomes.This PhD project is also tightly integrated with the
DSMZ’s current research related to the Genomic
Encyclopedia of Archaea and Bacteria (GEBA); see
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v462/n7276/-
full/nature08656.html .
The successful candidate will hold a master or diploma
degree in informatics or bioinformatics and will be expe-
rienced with programming in compiled languages such
as Java or C++ and scripting languages such as Ruby
or Python. Preferred students will also have experi-
ence in at least some of the following ﬁelds: database
programming, web programming (e.g., Ruby on Rails,
PHP), linux administration, phylogenetic inference and
genomics.
The DSMZ – Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroor-
ganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (German Collec-
tion of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures; http://-
www.dsmz.de/ ) is the most comprehensive Biological
Resource Centre in Europe. With more than 18.000
microorganisms, 1.200 plant viruses, 600 human and
animal cell lines, 770 plant cell cultures and more than
7.100 cultures deposited for the purposes of patenting,
we have demonstrated our obligation to serve science
for decades. The DSMZ is an independent, non-proﬁt
organisation.

PhD Position: Evolutionary Biology - Social Evolution
We seek a PhD student for a 3 year studentship, start-
ing October 2010 at Institute of Zoology, Zoological So-
ciety of London. http:// www.zsl.org/science/ . This
project addresses how sociality evolves, by testing key
hypotheses on the origins of queen and worker castes in
eusocial insects. Explaining worker behaviour (altru-
ism) in the eusocial insects was one of biggest problems
facing Darwin in developing his theory of natural se-
lection. Over the last few decades, our understanding
of caste evolution has been greatly advanced by kin-
selection theory, which explains altruism in terms of
the genetic ﬁtness beneﬁts workers gain from helping
raise relatives. Recently, the role of kin-selection in
social evolution has been questioned, and alternative,
mechanistic explanations for the evolution of queen andworker castes have been proposed. One such model
(the diapause hypothesis) posits that queen and worker
castes originated as two distinct developmental path-
ways, that arose from the bivoline life- history traits of
their solitary ancestor. This suggests that obligatory
hibernation (diapause) imposes a nutrient-dependent
switch during larval development, and that this is suf-
ﬁcient for the evolution of queen and worker develop-
mental pathways. In this way, altruism could evolve in
the absence of kin-selection. This studentship tests the
diapause hypothesis for the origins of caste by disen-
tangling the proximate and ultimate role of diapause
in caste determination in a primitively eusocial wasp,
Polistes canadensis. P. canadensis, is a paper wasp
found in tropical America, where females reproduce all
year round. The student will look for evidence of di-
apause and pre-imaginal caste diﬀerentiation using a
combination of behavioural manipulation experiments,
gene expression analyses and demographic traits. The
student will therefore receive a broad basis of training
in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, molecular
biology and genomics, whilst addressing fundamental
questions in evolutionary biology.
The Institute of Zoology (IoZ) is the research division
of the Zoological Society of London. It is a government-
funded research institute specialising in scientiﬁc is-
sues relevant to the conservation of animal species and
their habitats. The student will be based jointly at
the Institute of Zoology, (supervised by Dr Seirian
Sumner (principle) and Dr Nichola Raihani), and the
Dept of Biology at University of Sussex (supervised
by Prof. Jeremy Field). The student will therefore
beneﬁt from becoming a full member of these active
research groups that specialise in studying the evolu-
tion of sociality and behavioural ecology. The project
involves several months of ﬁeldwork in Panama, gene
expression analyses using cutting edge molecular tech-
niques, and lab-based manipulation experiments. Can-
didates should have a minimum of a good ﬁrst degree
(at least 2.1) in Biology or related subject. Field-
work and molecular experience is desirable, but not
essential. Interested candidates should email Dr Sum-
ner (Seirian.Sumner@ioz.ac.uk) for further information
prior to applying. Applications should be sent to Dr
Sumner by 25th January 2010. Please include a CV
and covering letter explaining your research interests
and why you would be a suitable candidate. Interviews
will be held in mid February.
Eligibility Funding would cover tuition fees and stipend
for UK students. EU students that have not been living
in the UK for 3 years or more, will only be eligible for
tuition fees. International students will not be eligible
for this funding however they are still welcome to ap-February 1, 2010 EvolDir 19

PhD Studentship in Molecular Biology and Aquacul-
ture
A PhD studentship is available within the Martin Ryan
Institute (MRI), National University of Ireland, Gal-
way, Ireland ( http://mri.nuigalway.ie/ ); as part of the
Sea Change Initiative-funded EIRCOD project, with
the support of the Marine Institute and the Marine
Research Sub-programme of the National Development
Plan 2007-2013.
This position will focus on the application of genetic
markers, such as microsatellites and SNPs, to the study
of both wild populations and farmed (captive) stocks of
Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The main aims will be to
investigate population structure of cod in waters around
Ireland and to support the ongoing EIRCOD brood-
stock and breeding programme. The increasing number
of genetic markers in combination with the availability
of captive stocks in a controlled environment also oﬀers
the potential to study mutational models and variation
of candidate genes, as well as their association to quan-
titative traits of commercial value.
Skills required:
This position is suitable to graduate students holding
at least a BSc (Hons) or equivalent in biological sciences
or related ﬁelds. Familiarity in molecular research and
population genetics are an asset, but preference will
be given to applications with previous experience in
molecular techniques, including microsatellite genotyp-
ing, DNA sequencing and relevant data analyses. The
successful candidate should be able to undertake re-
search independently as well as part of a team, show-
ing good organizational skills, creativity, initiative and
ability to cooperate. Some ﬁeld sampling is expected
(e.g. sampling ﬁsh in cages at sea and commercial land-
ings at ports), although most of the lab work will be
based at MRI Carna laboratories, which are located in
Carna, Connemara, in proximity to the captive stocks.
The PhD studentship is available immediately and it
will be funded for 4 years with a student fellowship of
25,000 euro p.a., which is tax-free and includes College
fees (currently c.5,400 euro p.a.).

NIOZ Netherlands
BenthicMarineBiodiversity
NIOZ, the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Re-
search, is the Dutch national oceanographic institute,
and it is one of the most important oceanographic in-
stitutes in the world. NIOZ is uniquely located on
the beautiful island of Texel on the Wadden Sea coast.
It employs over 250 staﬀ: research scientists, lab as-
sistants, technicians, ship crews, and auxiliary staﬀ.
NIOZ is one of the nine institutes that are part of
the Netherlands Organisation for Scientiﬁc Research
(NWO).
The department of Marine Ecology, which studies the
structure and functioning of marine foodwebs, has a
vacancy for a PhD student
“Ecological eﬀects of predation by intertidal shorebirds
on marine benthic communities”In the current biodiversity decline, predators are of-
ten the ﬁrst to disappear. Predators are thought to
play a positive role in biodiversity maintenance as they
prevent certain prey species in achieving dominance,
relaxing resource competition among prey, hence pro-
moting prey growth rates, prey coexistence and diver-
sity. Losses of species at the highest trophic levels
in communities may therefore cause extinctions and
shifts in size structure at lower trophic levels. How-
ever, this role of predators is still often underappre-
ciated, largely because many ecosystems have already
lost their top-predators and/or human-induced distur-
bances now blur the positive predation eﬀects. Further-
more, the role of migrant predators structuring com-
munities along their migratory route has mostly been
neglected.
For this reason, this project explores the eﬀects of pre-
dation in one of the most pristine and undisturbed in-
tertidal ecosystems in the world, the Banc d’Arguin
(Mauritania, West Africa). Here we will study the
structuring role of molluscivore shorebirds, notably the
red knot (Calidris canutus), on the intertidal benthic
community. The decline of wintering population of
knots at Banc d’Arguin (due to habitat-destruction
elsewhere along the ﬂyway) coincides with an increase
in the knot’s main prey species and a decline in overall
mollusc diversity. Taking an experimental approach,
we will explore whether these are causal relationships.
For example, by excluding knots from small-scale study
plots, the PhD-student will focus on how prey competi-
tion and species coexistence are aﬀected by predation.
Modelling tools will be employed in order to explore the
consequences at the ecosystem level.
REQUIREMENTS
We are looking for an enthusiastic young biologist inter-
ested in scaling-up from behavior to community ecol-
ogy, both empirically but also theoretically. The can-
didate should be able to cope with the primitive and
sometimes harsh ﬁeld conditions when working in Mau-
ritania. Aﬃnity with birds is not a requirement, and
neither is a command of French, but both will be seen as
assets. The assignment should lead to the completion
of a PhD-dissertation at the University of Groningen

OhioStateU InvasiveInsectPopGenet
Invasive species permeate both the natural and man-
aged landscapes. These exotic species often have pro-
found negative impacts on native biodiversity by inﬂu-
encing abiotic conditions, or increasing competition for
food or other resources. Increasingly, invaders also in-
teract with one another in ways that exacerbate their
impacts on ecological communities and environments.
The success of an invasive species depends not only on
the biology of the invader itself, but the ecological com-
munity and environment that is being invaded. Often
these lead to invasion meltdowns, where the introduc-
tion of one species facilitates the invasion of additional
species. The soybean aphid plays a key role in a recent
ecological invasion meltdown involving its invasive pri-
mary host plant, buckthorn, and its key predator, the
multi-colored Asian lady beetle. This USDA-funded
position will speciﬁcally focus on soybean aphid pop-
ulation and landscape genetics, with emphasis on the
role of buckthorn during secondary and primary host
colonization. The project will combine ﬁeld work (in-
cluding soybean aphid collecting at various sites across
the Midwestern US), as well as molecular data gen-
eration (microsatellites and single nucleotide polymor-
phisms). Ph.D. students are preferred, but Master’s
students are strongly urged to apply. The ideal start
time would be summer of 2010, but start date is ﬂex-
ible. For more information, please contact Dr. Andy

Project description: The purpose is to examine how
diﬀerence in food web structure among sites from Upp-
land to Norrbotten has aﬀected the interaction between
purple loosestrife and its two main herbivores. A key
issue to explore in this project will be plant odours
and how the regional variation in volatiles aﬀect both
the plant-herbivore interaction as well as the interac-
tion between the herbivores and their natural enemies.
The PhD-project will mainly examine the interaction
from the herbivore perspective and will study the role
of plant chemistry, herbivore behaviour and population
dynamics for the strength of species interaction and
for the evolution of species traits. The work will in-
volve both ﬁeld and laboratory work, behavioural stud-
ies and chemical analyses. The chemical work will beFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 23

Closing date: 15 February 2010 Project description:
Project title: Phylogeny, taxonomy and character evo-
lution in Acoela. Acoela are marine worms usually
about 1 mm in length. Molecular phylogenetic studies
have demonstrated that Acoela are the oldest extant
bilaterian clade. Consequently, acoels have recently re-
ceived a lot of attention from biologists studying bila-
terian evolution. There are about 380 known species
of acoels world-wide, and 56 of these are recorded in
Swedish waters. Currently there is no comprehensive
phylogenetic hypothesis for Acoela, and the legacy clas-
siﬁcation that is in use is problematic. The aims of the
project are to reconstruct phylogeny, character evolu-
tion and species delimitation within two problematic
acoel families. One of the aims is to establish a phy-
logenetic classiﬁcation for the studied groups. Acoel
anatomy is simple, but also highly variable. Phyloge-
netic hypotheses generated within the project will be
used to study correlations between morphological and
molecular evolution within the group. The project will
include molecular phylogenetic lab work and analysis
of data using phylogenetic methods and bioinformat-
ics. Acoels have no planktonic larvae or other dispersal
stages. Their dispersal abilities are therefore likely to
be poor. Nevertheless, there are many morphological
species that are considered cosmopolitan. Species de-
limitation in morphological species will be studied us-
ing molecular genetics. The project will partly rely on
previously collected material, but a signiﬁcant collec-
tion eﬀort is necessary requiring travel to marine ﬁeld
stations. Identiﬁcation of Acoela requires study of live
material under a light microscope.
The working language will be English and Swedish.
Qualiﬁcations: To be qualiﬁed for research studies in
systematic zoology the applicant needs to have passed
at least 120 hp of biology studies, including an ap-
proved independent project in systematic zoology of
at least 30hp at the advanced level. Applicants who
have acquired the corresponding competence at another
Swedish or foreign university are also qualiﬁed.
Criteria for selection: Among qualiﬁed applicants, se-24 EvolDir February 1, 2010
lection is made according to ability to proﬁt from the
studies. The criteria to be used are the applicant’s doc-
umented knowledge in subjects of relevance for the re-
search area, ability to master language (including both
spoken and written English), analytical ability, creativ-
ity, initiative, independence, and ability to cooperate.
The basis for judgement of how well the applicant ful-
ﬁls these criteria is: the relevance of earlier studies for
the research area, grades on courses at the university
level, the quality of the independent project, references,
relevant practical experience, interviews and the appli-
cant’s letter of intent. Previous experience of molecular
phylogenetics, bioinformatics and documented studies
in invertebrate zoology and marine biology are consid-
ered particularly relevant.
To be included in the application: Maximum one A4-
page of personal presentation and your reasons for ap-
plying (letter of intent). Curriculum vitae. Copy of
independent project report (preious thesis work) and
publications. Documentation of other activities of rele-
vance. Copy of degree certiﬁcates, or LADOK-excerpt.
Terms of employment: The research education com-
prises 48 months at full time. The position is ﬁnanced
by a fellowship (“utbildningsbidrag”) for the ﬁrst two
years, and then continues with PhD-employment until
the end of the PhD-program.

Dear EvolDir Members,
Please share the below PhD Studentship advertisement
with any interested parties.
Thank you, Anne Smith
PhD Studentship in Ecology
Evolutionary interaction networks: Application to on-going ﬁeld work in Tanzania
Evolutionary systems consist of a complex web of in-
teractions: among species, and between species and
their environment. Understanding these interactions
is important for predicting how factors - such as bio-
logical or chemical control agents, grazing pressure, or
climate change - may aﬀect ecosystem function. How-
ever, unravelling such complex networks of interactions
stretches the boundaries of current research; new meth-
ods are needed to handle the complexity of real ecosys-
tems.
This studentship explores the use of a methodology
new to ecological analysis, Bayesian networks, for re-
vealing ecological interaction networks. You will de-
velop Bayesian network algorithms for handling ecolog-
ical data and incorporating spatial information. Meth-
ods developed will be applied to real ecological data,
including data collected in an ongoing ﬁeld project in
Tanzania. There is opportunity for a ﬁeld season in
Tanzania, where you would perform targeted manipu-
lation experiments based on your models (e.g., targeted
removal and addition of species within caged areas).
This project will be based in Dr Anne Smith’s lab at St
Andrews and be in collaboration with Dr Colin Beale
(York University, currently based in Tanzania) and Dr
Dirk Husmeier (Biomathematics & Statistics Scotland).
In this studentship, you will gain both computational
and ﬁeld skills.

MosquitoEvolutionaryGenetics
A PhD student position is available for conducting NIH-
funded research in the Slotman lab in the Department
of Entomology at Texas A&M University. The Slot-
man lab is interested in the evolutionary genetics of
malaria mosquitoes, with an emphasis on the Anophe-
les gambiae complex. The major malaria vector in this
complex, An. gambiae s.s, strongly prefers blood feed-
ing on humans and it is strongly attracted to the smell
of human sweat. This anthropophily or preference for
humans is one the main reasons An. gambiae is such
an eﬃcient malaria vector.
The PhD candidate will investigate the genetic basis
of the strong preference of An. gambiae for human
hosts, using QTL mapping, evolutionary genetics, and
gene expression approaches. The ultimate goal of the
project is to identify olfaction genes responsible for the
attraction of An. gambiae to humans. The results of
this research would contribute greatly to our under-
standing of the biology of this important vector, and
would promote the development of novel malaria con-
trol methods. For example, we expect that anthro-
pophily genes will be promising targets for designing
repellents/attractants, or for transgenic mosquito ef-
forts.
The preferred candidate should have a strong interest
in medical entomology, and some background in (evo-
lutionary) genetics is preferred. The successful can-
didate will be expected to conduct mosquito crosses
and behavioral assays at Wageningen University in The
Netherlands at the start of the PhD program. Preferred
start date; early summer 2010, but nor later that Sept
2010.

ronment

The goal of this project is to improve our understand-
ing of the genetic basis of female sexual preferences.
This will be undertaken using the African stalk-eyed ﬂy
Diasemopsis meigenii. We already have a good under-
standing of how to accurately measure individual mate
preference in this species. Our aim is to uncover the
number of genes involved, their eﬀect sizes and link-
age patterns. It will also be interesting to map the
genes for the male ornamental trait (eyespan), and un-
cover the nature of any genetic covariance with female
preference. The student will also map genes for male
fertility and ejaculate properties (sperm and accessory
gland proteins) as these are thought to be important in
determining the beneﬁts of mate choice. The genetic
analyses will be carried out using QTL (quantitative
trait locus) mapping on a SNP map of the Diasemopsis
meigenii genome. The student will work closely with
a postdoctoral fellow and research technician employed
on our NERC grant addressing these topics, and with
other members of the stalk-eyed ﬂy group with diverse
interests in reproductive biology and sexual selection.

Project Descriptions:
Evolution and coevolution of Daphnia and their para-
sites
Host-parasite coevolutionary interactions may impact
population densities, genetic diversity and breeding sys-
tems. There is however, limited knowledge of just
how dynamics work in natural systems and in the
wild. We investigate a genetic variation in the crus-
tacean Daphnia, focusing on key traits that inﬂuence
parasite-mediated selection: maternal eﬀects, immune
responses (both cellular and molecular) and immuno-
senescence. We have also recently initiated large-scale
genomic/transcriptomic work.
Applications are invited from students with a suitable
degree in biological sciences for a studentship to investi-
gate Daphnia immunity and coevolution. There is alsoample scope to widen the research towards other as-
pects of the ecology, evolution or molecular evolution
of Daphnia and their parasites
The dynamics of cross species transmission in multi-
host systems
The dynamics of infectious disease have often been
studied in single host species infected by a single par-
asite species, and yet the majority of parasites can
infect more than one host species. These multi-host
pathogens are associated with emerging infectious dis-
eases (EIDs), which pose great risks to human health
and biodiversity. The likelihood of disease emergence
from a reservoir species will depend on dynamic pro-
cesses determined by both between- and within-species
transmission rates. The long-term consequences of
cross species transmission are hard to predict and range
from transient, non self- sustaining “spillover” events
(Hantavirus) to persistent self- sustaining epidemics
(HIV). Ecological and evolutionary forces acting on
both hosts and pathogens will inﬂuence these long-term
consequences. However, the factors that constrain or
facilitate such emergences are poorly understood.
The aim of this project is to understand the ecological
and evolutionary conditions that determine the dynam-
ics of cross species transmission in multi-host systems.
While most research on disease emergence occurs after
the event, here the student will use a tractable labora-
tory system to (1) measures rates of cross species trans-
mission, (2) determine the ecological and evolutionary
factors that favour transmission, and (3) ultimately
make predictions about when and where cross species
transmission is likely to cause novel disease emergence.
The research will focus on a model multi-insect multi-
virus system, consisting of stored food moths and their
associated baculoviruses.
While the research will be focused on this insect sys-
tem, on-going projects in my group also include (1)
experiments with wild rodent populations and their
parasite communities and (2) comparative studies of
disease emergence in primates and humans. Both re-
search areas incorporate multi-host pathogens, allowing
for broad cross- system investigations of the dynamics
of cross species transmission. Given the recent surge
of EIDs, understanding the dynamics of disease persis-
tence in novel hosts has never been more important.
Evolution and coevolution in amoeba and their bacte-
rial parasites
Host-parasite coevolutionary interactions may impact
population densities, genetic diversity and breeding sys-
tems. Outside of a few carefully controlled laboratory
systems, we have little appreciation of coevolutionaryFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 31
dynamics. Are frequency-dependent cycles common, or
does coevolution occur in random busts? Does environ-
mental noise overwhelm genetic interactions? We have
recently initiated evolutionary studies on a set of inter-
actors that are highly amenable to study in the wild:
acanthamoeba and amoeba-resisting bacteria. We hope
to continue this work with a focused PhD.
Applications are invited from students with a suitable
degree in biological sciences for a studentship to in-
vestigate amoeba-bacteria interactions and coevolution.
There is also ample scope to widen the research towards
almost any aspects of the ecology or evolution of these
biological enemies.

Evolution in the Scottish Highlands: have forest trees
adapted to local environments ?
Individuals should send a CV and a personal
statement of research interests and aims directly
to: Dr. Richard Ennos rennos@ed.ac.uk (see
www.ﬁndaphd.com Search: pine edinburgh)
Recent work has shown that populations of Scots Pine
are phenotypically diﬀerent. However, because the
species migrated north to Scotland from continental
Europe after the end of the last Ice Age, the varia-
tion we see may be no more than a reﬂection of the
diﬀerent origins of the earliest migrants. Disentangling
the eﬀects of population history and natural selection
in this species is the key to understanding its genetic
diversity, and to the long term protection of the last
fragments of the ancient Caledonian Forest. Resolving
the inﬂuence of these two forces is a key question in
contemporary evolutionary research and is of keen in-
terest in ﬁelds from bacterial to human biology. This
project will combine the power of next-generation se-
quencing technology and classical genetics to examine
the history and origins of the last remnants of the orig-
inal Scots Pine forests in Scotland and test for adaptive
responses to the wide environmental spectrum the treemeets on these sites. By engaging directly with Forest
Research, the successful candidate will help to deﬁne
adaptive management strategies for the species to en-
sure resilience of the species to projected environmental
change.
Speciﬁcally, the project will: 1. Use high-throughput
sequencing to characterise variation across more of the
Scots Pine mitochondrial genome than any previous
study, and use this data to resolve the historical ori-
gins of the Scottish populations. 2. Use experimen-
tal approaches to probe adaptive diﬀerentiation among
populations, by a combination of detailed phenotyping,
stress-testing and quantitative genetics.
The project will be jointly supervised by Dr. Richard
Ennos (University of Edinburgh), Dr. Stephen Cavers
(Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Edinburgh) and
Dr. Joan Cottrell (Forest Research, Edinburgh).

ULiverpool Experimental Evolution
NERC-funded PhD position to study “parasite life his-
tory evolution” using experimental evolution with mi-
crobes at the University of Liverpool, UK
Project: Genetic basis of parasite life-history evolu-
tion Supervisors: Steve Paterson and Mike Brockhurst.
Start date October 2010.
Description: Parasites have the ability to rapidly adapt
to their hosts, a process that is critical to understand-
ing and controlling infectious disease. One important
challenge from a practical perspective is to understand
how parasite virulence (the damage they cause to hosts)
and infectiousness (the ability to establish new infec-
tions) evolve in response to changes in host ecology. In
this project we will examine the genes responsible to
changes in key life-history traits, such as virulence and
transmission, and how these genes evolve in response
to changes in host density, quality, etc. We will use an
experimental bacteria-phage system in which we can;
observe evolution over the course of days rather than
years, control the ecology of both host and parasite,
and freeze populations to trace evolution back through
time. This experimental evolution system will be com-
bined with molecular and population genetic methods,
which are a novel and exciting, approach that has re-February 1, 2010 EvolDir 33
cently led to a publication in Nature from our group.
Training for both projects will be provided in: microbi-
ology, molecular ecology, evolutionary genetics, statis-
tics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and sequencing.
There is considerable ﬂexibility within the project for
the student to develop his/her own interests, with guid-
ance and support from the supervisors.

CulturalEvolution
Two Linked PhD Studentships:
Human Cultural Transmission: From Psychology Lab
To The Artefactual Record Queen Mary, University of
London and University of Kent (UK)
Applications are invited for two linked Leverhulme
Trust-funded, 3-year PhD studentships for the project
Human Cultural Transmission: From Psychology Lab
To The Artefactual Record.
The two scholarships cover all tuition fees at UK/EUrates plus an annual tax-free stipend of approximately
15,000. The aim of this project is to use a combi-
nation of experimental and analytical methods to ex-
plain the cultural evolution of prehistoric artefacts. Ex-
perimental methods will be used to simulate the cul-
tural transmission of computer-generated and physical-
replica Acheulean handaxes along chains of participants
in the lab. Speciﬁc studies will address the inﬂuence of
perceptual and motor constraints on artefact transmis-
sion, the eﬀect of social learning mechanism (e.g. imita-
tion, teaching), and the role of intergroup boundaries.
The resulting data will be analysed using a range of
evolutionary-based methods (e.g. phylogenetic analy-
ses, cultural evolution models, agent-based simulations)
allowing quantitative comparison with actual prehis-
toric Acheulean datasets. One student, supervised by
Dr Alex Mesoudi and based at Queen Mary, Univer-
sity of London, will specialise in computer-based exper-
iments, psychological theory and mathematical/agent-
based models. The other, supervised by Dr Stephen
Lycett and based at the University of Kent, will spe-
cialise in physical (non-computerbased) experiments,
archaeological theory and phylogenetic analyses. Regu-
lar meetings between both sets of students and supervi-
sors will encourage inter-disciplinary interaction. Both
students will acquire expertise and key skills across a
range of disciplines, including biological anthropology,
archaeology and psychology. Applications are invited
from candidates with, or expecting to obtain, at least an
upper-second class honours degree in an area relevant
to the project (e.g. psychology, archaeology, anthropol-
ogy, biology). Candidates with suitable MSc training
are particularly welcome to apply. Applications will
be considered separately for each studentship. Appli-
cants may apply for both positions, but should apply
separately and demonstrate in each case how they are
suitably qualiﬁed.
The application deadline for both studentships is 1st
March 2010. Interviews will be held in April for a
1st Sept 2010 start date. Funding covers fees and
tuition for UK/EU students, although international
students may be eligible depending on circumstances.

UNeuchatel PlantSystematics
A PhD position on Plant systematics is available in the
Department of Evolutionary Botany at the University
of Neuchˆ atel, Switzerland.
Topic: Systematics of the genus Macrocarpaea (Gen-
tianaceae) in southern Peru and Bolivia
This research project concerns the biodiversity of
the neotropical gentian genus Macrocarpaea in the
Cordillera Central of central and southern Peru and
adjacent Bolivia. Most of the ca. 25 species of Macro-
carpaea in this region form a monophyletic group of
derived position within the genus. This group has sev-
eral unique characters unknown in any other group of
the genus, notably winged seeds and a derived pollen
type. In addition to the preparation of a taxonomic re-
vision of the group, this project aims to answer several
questions. Why and how have such unique morpho-
logical characters evolved in this geographical region?
What evolutionary function do they bring to eﬀective
pollination and subsequent presumed wind dispersal?
To answer such questions, extensive ﬁeldwork will be
conducted in Peru and Bolivia. Subsequent laboratory
work will include molecular techniques, cytology, and
anatomy including scanning electron microscopy.
The successful candidate must hold a MSc degree in
Biology, have experience in plant taxonomy preferably
including molecular techniques, and be independent to
conduct extensive ﬁeldwork in the tropical Andes. Can-
didates with proﬁciency in Spanish are highly welcome.
The appointment must lead to the completion of a PhD
thesis within three years. The candidate will be super-
vised by Dr. Jason R. Grant as well as committee mem-
bers from other institutions in Switzerland and abroad.
The candidate will participate in the teaching of sev-eral undergraduate laboratory exercises and excursions,
and will be enrolled in the Interuniversity Doctoral Pro-
gram in Organismal Biology: http://www2.unine.ch/-
dp-biol/page24151 . This is a 3-year appointment that
begins August 1, 2010.
Applicants should send their applications to Dr. Jason
R. Grant, e-mail: jason.grant@unine.ch. The applica-
tion should include letter of motivation, CV, copy of
academic degree(s), list of publications and conference
participations, copies of publications in PDF format,
an abstract of research done during the MSc thesis, and
the names and addresses of three references. Deadline
for application is March 1, 2010.

UOslo BirdSpermEvolution
Natural History Museum, University of Oslo PhD po-
sition: Sperm competition in passerine birds
The PhD candidate will be part of a team working on
the project ’Sperm, speciation and promiscuity - An in-
tegrated analysis of evolution in passerine birds’. The
PhD position is funded by NHM whereas the remaining
part of the project is funded by the Research Council of
Norway. Throughout the animal kingdom sperm cells
are extremely diversiﬁed. In passerine birds they show
strong signatures of selection by sperm competition in-
duced by female promiscuity. The intensity of sperm
competition also varies considerably among passerine
species. The main aim of the project is to advance our
understanding of how sperm cells evolve and diversify
in a sperm competition context. The project will apply
a variety of analytical tools, like in-vitro sperm motility
analysis, high-resolution microscopy with digital imag-
ing and morphometrics, advanced protein and DNA
fragment and sequence analysis, and standard phyloge-
netic analysis and comparative statistics methods. The
project includes comprehensive ﬁeld work in Norway
and abroad.
In addition to the PhD candidate, the project team
will consist of two postdocs, on ﬁeld/lab techni-
cian, a network of international collaborators and36 EvolDir February 1, 2010

USheﬃeld GrassEvolution
Opportunity for PhD study in the UK ˆ a Evolutionary
Biology
Applications are invited for a PhD studentship in the
Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the Uni-
versity of Sheﬃeld, UK, with the Royal Botanic Gar-
dens, Kew as CASE partner. The studentship is funded
by NERC, and provides fees and a maintenance bur-
sary for UK nationals (or residents in the UK for the
past 3 years), including an additional ˆA£1000 per year
from the CASE partner. It will be supervised by Colin
Osborne and Rob Freckleton (University of Sheﬃeld),
David Simpson (Kew), and Pascal-Antoine Christin
(Brown University).
The project will investigate how ecological and func-
tional diversity has evolved in the ˆ aAlloteropsis-forest
shade cladeˆ a of grasses, an ecologically diverse lineage
of 130 extant species. These include the worldˆ as most
productive plant and its most important weeds, two to
four evolutionary transitions between the C3 and C4
photosynthetic pathways, and the only species with C3
and C4 subspecies. The C4 pathway is a turbo-charger
for photosynthesis that has evolved many times. What
sequence of morphological changes and habitat tran-
sitions led to C4 evolution in grasses? And was the
evolution of C4 photosynthesis associated with a shift
in net diversiﬁcation and the occupation of new niche
space? The project is highly relevant to the current
global research eﬀort to bioengineer the C4 photosyn-
thetic pathway in rice, which aims to boost yield in
this important crop. More generally, the PhD project
also aims to advance our fundamental understanding of
trait evolution in the grasses.
The objectives of the project are: 1) To sequence DNA
for all of the species in the clade, and use these data to
construct the ﬁrst complete species-level phylogeny for
any grass lineage of this size; 2) To acquire information
on morphological and functional plant traits, ecological
niche characteristics (e.g. climate, ﬁre regime, habitat),
and geographical range for each species, and map these
onto the phylogeny; 3) To reconstruct the evolution-February 1, 2010 EvolDir 37
ary history of each of these characters, and to explore
the relationships between morphological and functional
trait evolution, the occupation of new ecological niche
space, shifts in geographical range, and changes in the
net diversiﬁcation rate.
The student will be trained in the latest techniques
in phylogenetics, ecological informatics and compar-
ative methods, and will have an unrivalled opportu-
nity to work closely with some of the worldˆ as lead-
ing experts on grasses in the herbarium at RBG Kew.
The project will exploit GrassPortal ˆ a a new ecological
informatics resource developed by Sheﬃeld and Kew
(www.grassportal.org ).

UStirling ForestConservation
Importance of waterborne seed dispersal for conserva-
tion of alder-dominated riparian woodlands
Black alder, Alnus glutinosa Gaertn, is the most abun-dant native tree in Scottish riparian woodlands where
it plays a key ecological role. Despite its importance
in riparian ecosystem function, the reproduction and
dispersal dynamics of the species has been little stud-
ied. Seeds are small and equipped with air-ﬁlled wings
that enable them to ﬂoat. Long-distance water disper-
sal of seeds for several km is therefore believed to be
driven by ﬂowing water. This project proposes to in-
vestigate the relationship between river ﬂow dynamics
and and river margin colonisation by alder via water-
borne seed dispersal in a river catchment using a land-
scape genetics approach. Field activities will be based
in Scotland; in the river Tay catchment which contains
large areas of undisturbed alder dominated ﬂoodplain
habitat of high nature conservation value. Laboratory
activities will involve genotyping of microsatellite mark-
ers to detect patterns of seed-mediated gene dispersal.
The project will oﬀer scope to develop a geographically-
explicit model integrating ecological and genetics data
in order to investigate how landscape characteristics,
such as fragmentation by dams and ﬂood embank-
ments, aﬀects dispersal distance and connectivity of
alder-dominated riparian woodlands and thus inform
their conservation management.
The project will require a combination of ﬁeld work,
molecular biology, data analysis and modeling. Indi-
viduals with an interest in ecological genetics are en-
couraged to apply. The successful candidate will join
the restoration genetics group in the School of Biolog-
ical and Environmental Sciences at the University of
Stirling.
To apply please email Dr Bacles

CV and personal statement of research interests with
contact details of two referees.
Closing date for application: 15 February 2010.
The applicant MUST have a good 1st degree (at least
a 2.1) and/or MSc in a relevant subject. Appli-
cations are expected all year round but those sent
by 15/02/2010 will be eligible to enter our stu-
dentship competition. We expect applications to
be highly competitive. Although no deadline has
yet been ﬁxed, interviews are likely to take place

description: based on the current state-of-the-art, the
researcher will undertake generate and publish the re-
sults of scientiﬁc research in the areas of population and
community ecology and agroecology.
Level: Researcher Grade: Senior Researcher (INRA
CR1)
Themes of research: community ecology in agroecosys-
tems
Competences sought: Solid knowledge in community
ecology (plant or animal) and in thhe ecology of trophic
networks. Knowledge in agronomy. Openness towards
modelling and spatial analyses. Keen interest on pluri-
disciplinary approaches and on collaborative research.
Training: PhD or equivalent; a post-doctoral experi-
ence, preferably abroad, will be appreciated.
Context: The main drivers of global change (land use
changes, climate changes, overexploitation of natural
resources) operate at regional scales. European agroe-
cosystems are simultaneously aﬀected by these three
drivers of global change. Moreover, they interact and
covary to such an extent that it is becoming increas-
ingly diﬃcult to disentangle and to predict their joint
eﬀects on biological communities. As the dominant
land use in France and in Europe, the perturbations
due to farming are the key process underlying theFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 41
changes in diversity in agroecosystems. The ecolog-
ical consequences of these perturbations are observ-
able at the individual, population and community lev-
els. The aim is to understand how the spatial hetero-
geneity of human activities in intensive agroecosystems
aﬀects the persistence of natural populations and the
local and regional community structures. A second
aim is to disentangle the eﬀect climate change and or
land use changes by analysing the relationships between
landscape-prey-predators and their changes over time.
The research program concerns populations and com-
munities of species of agronomic interest because of the
ecological or trophic services they provide and/or the
control of crop pests (i.e. weeds, small mammals, in-
sects). Within the context of temporally and spatially
variable environmental conditions, the researcher will
investigate how historic and ecological processes acting
upon individuals and populations determine commu-
nity patterns. The researcher will contribute to the
understanding of the ecological interactions determin-
ing species coexistence and community structure, no-
tably predation as well as intra- and inter-speciﬁc com-
petition. He/she will also address these questions in
a broader context: what management practices (no-
tably in grasslands and other semi-natural components
of agroecosystems) are compatible with both the main-
tenance of biodiversity and its associated ecological ser-
vices at the regional level and with the economic via-
bility of farms at the local level? The researcher will
use empirical and/or modelling approaches and he/she
will take part in the pluridisciplinary eﬀort integrat-
ing biologists, agronomists, economists and sociologists
at the long-term study site of the CNRS-Chiz´ e. Re-
sources available for the development of the candidate’s
research program: the long term study site is large (the
cereal plain of Chiz´ e, 450 km2) and has been studied
for 15 years through the scientiﬁc programmes of the
CNRS-Chiz´ e. The biological and agronomical moni-
toring are both annual and exhaustive: the land use
of 18 000 agricultural ﬁelds is recorded twice (spring
and summer) yearly since 1994, and the abundance and
distribution of insects (Coleoptera, grasshoppers) are
quantiﬁed in space (using stratiﬁed sampling) and time
(seasonal and/or annual); weed data on the main crops
are available since 2005. Finally, inquiries on more than
130 individual farms since 2003 will shed light on the
determinants (constraints, history) of farming systems
and their possibilities of evolution. In total, 23 research
teams (mostly from INRA) currently work at the long-
term study site of Chiz´ e in the context of many research
programs (ECOGER, ADD-ANR, ESF, etc.). The re-
searcher will take part in on-going research programs
at the long-term study of Chiz´ e and will proﬁt from its
logistics, administration and ﬁnances, as well as fromthe internal scientiﬁc dynamics of the CNRS-Chiz´ e.

SimulatingPopulations
A 16 month position for a computer software engi-
neer is available at the Research Unit on Improve-
ment, Genetics and Physiology of Forest Trees ( http:/-
/www.orleans.inra.fr/les unites/ur agpf) at INRA Or-
leans (France).
Computer programs were developed in FORTRAN (95)
to simulate the genetic evolution of populations sub-
jected to artiﬁcial selection. The recruited engineer will
be in charge of 1) adding new methods for genotypic
evaluation to the simulation program on the basis of
algorithms provided by the scientiﬁc team and testing
their implementation with various sets of parameters
2) the development of a graphical interface to facili-
tate the use of the simulation tool by breeders. The
position is opened in the framework of WP3 “Design-
ing and implementation of improved/novel tree breed-
ing strategies” of NovelTree European research project
(http://www.noveltree.eu/index.php ). The simulation
tool resulting from this work will be used in priority
to optimize the poplar breeding strategies managed by
the Research Unit but will also be of interest for other
forest tree species.
Starting date should be as soon as possible after March
1st 2010. The application deadline will be February 20
2010.
Job details Collect, adapt and optimize existing sta-
tistical routines found in scientiﬁc literature or public
repositories to implement them in the simulation pro-
gram. These routines concern the BLUP (Best Linear
Unbiaised Prediction) methodology, which uses genetic
relationships from a given pedigree to predict individ-
ual breeding values in a breeding population. In order
to use genotypic data to predict breeding values, write
routines and test them by simulation in the framework
of the existing simulation program. This will comprise
the generation of IBD (identity By descent) matrices
at marker and QTL positions and their integration in
the BLUP evaluation. Some parts of the software will
be validated by comparison with commercial tools (AS-
Reml, Gibbs samplers for genetic mixed models, etc.).
Conceive an interface facilitating the use of the sim-
ulation tool by breeders, in connection with potential
users, and build it.February 1, 2010 EvolDir 43

ALFP background noise answers
Here the answers to my questions. Thanks
- Which are the main causes of background noise and
how to correct it?
You will undoubtedly get a mix of high quality mark-
ers and low quality markers and anything in between.
Some markers can be quite sensitive to reaction condi-
tions, while others are very robust. Slight inconsisten-
cies between the diﬀerent tips of a multichannel pipette
may cause markers to drop out and I even had some
markes that only worked at the edges of a 96 well plate
due to minute diﬀerences in PCR block temperature
response between centre and edges! (i.e. column 1, col-
umn 12, row 1, and row 8 gave peaks while the rest of
the wells did not). Don’t be scared by all this. Most
markers will perform ﬁne. If a markers is suspect, just
leave it out.
- May the dye colour inﬂuence the magnitude of the
background noise?
Don’t think so
- How can protein / phenol contamination of the ex-
tracted DNA aﬀect AFLP quality?
Some people get the best results with DNA extracted
with qiagen DNeasy kit. Also phenol extracted DNA
pellet diluted in H2O often works better than diluted in
TE (but the DNA will be less stable over long periods
of time in water).
- Is there any problem to overlay multiple primers with
diﬀerent dye labels? May peaks in one dye interfere
with detection of other dyes?Should be OK, but you will get spectral bleeding for the
strongest peaks. They (the real marker and the back-
ground peak) will give the same present-absent pattern
in and should be easy to identify.
Good luck
These aren’t elementary questions. We are all still
working to ﬁgure out the best way to cut out noise
from AFLPs. I ﬁnd running at least one pre-amp and
one selective amp (some people only run the selective
amp) helps cut back on some of the noise. Also, make
sure you set your threshold above the noise. (You can
usually eye-ball that one.) One last note on that part:
stick with larger peaks, as their less likely to be aﬀected
by things other than your typical DNA.
I don’t know if dye color can aﬀect the noise. We don’t
have a lot of money, so we only run one dye (and a
diﬀerent dye-ladder) at a time. Hopefully someone else
can get back to you on that one. I also don’t know if
the diﬀerent dyes can aﬀect each other, but considering
a lot of people use this approach, I would like to assume
any eﬀect is minimal.
As for the protein/phenol contamination, typically it
causes problems in repeatability. Therefore, make sure
you run many of your samples multiple times (the rule
of thumb is 10%, but I typically run any of my “trou-
ble” samples multiple times) and discard bins where the
peaks are not replicable.
My favorite reference for ﬂorescently-labeled AFLPs
is Meudt and Clarke 2007, Almost forgotten or latest
practice? AFLP applications, analyses and advances.
Trends in Plant Science 12(3): 106-117. Even though
it is a couple years old, it hits on most of the major
questions to be considered with AFLPs.
Good luck!
Subject: Other: question about AFLP background
noise
Dear all,
Maybe these are very elementary questions for this list,
but I am beginning with AFLP analysis and I have
some doubts (probably elementary ones as I said)
- Which are the main causes of background noise and
how to correct it? - May the dye colour inﬂuence the
magnitude of the background noise? - How can protein
/ phenol contamination of the extracted DNA aﬀect
AFLP quality? - Is there any problem to overlay mul-
tiple primers with diﬀerent dye labels? May peaks in
one dye interfere with detection of other dyes?
Any references you could advice me to get into this
subject and clarify my doubts?54 EvolDir February 1, 2010

quin for preparing large batches ( >200 individuals) of

AmerSocMammalogists
StudentResearchAwards
The Honoraria Committee of the American Society of
Mammalogists welcomes applications for graduate hon-
oraria and undergraduate research awards. The ap-
plication process for the graduate awards has changed
from previous years but that for the undergradu-
ate awards remains the same. For more informa-
tion, see the Honoraria Committee webpage at http://-
www.mammalsociety.org/committees/indexhonor.asp
CALL FOR GRADUATE STUDENT HONORARIA
Graduate students are encouraged to submit a sum-
mary of a research project on any aspect of mammalogy
for consideration by the Honoraria Committee. The
Anna M. Jackson, A. Brazier Howell, and Elmer C.Birney Awards recognize outstanding research projects
completed by the Society’s graduate student members
and are among the Society’s highest student honors.
Winners will present their research to the Society at
the Plenary Session of the Annual Meeting, to be held
at the University of Wyoming in June 2010. Please note
that application procedures have changed for the 2010
competition.
Detailed instructions:
Eligibility: The competition is open to all graduate
student members of the American Society of Mam-
malogists, regardless of nationality or current insti-
tutional aﬃliation. To become a member of the
Society visit the ASM membership page at http://-
www.mammalsociety.org/membership/index.html .Ap-
plicants must be Masters or doctoral students (or have
completed their degrees during the previous Fall term)
when they apply. Applicants must not have received a
previous Graduate Honorarium from ASM, or a Sha-
dle or ASM Fellowship. However, recipients of ASM
Grant-in-Aid of Research and Latin American Stu-
dent Field Research awards are eligible and encouraged
to apply. Students unsure of their eligibility are en-
couraged to contact the Honoraria Committee (hono-
raria@mammalsociety.org) well in advance of the appli-
cation deadline.
Research Statement: Applicants should submit a sum-
mary of their graduate research not exceeding 1000
words (excluding Literature Cited, ﬁgures, or tables)
with the following clearly labeled sections: Title,
Project Signiﬁcance/ Theoretical Context, Methods,
Results, and Discussion/Interpretation. Please include
key ﬁgures/tables (3 items maximum) with concise cap-
tions to support your results. Research currently un-
der review or ’in press’ may be submitted. Applicants
should note that the Honoraria Committee is composed
of members from across diﬀerent subdisciplines of mam-
malogy, and therefore are urged to write for a broad,
scientiﬁcally literate audience and to avoid excessive
jargon or technical terms. Collaborative work with mul-
tiple authors may be submitted, so long as the applicant
has played the primary role in designing and conduct-
ing the research (the reference letter, see below, should
address this issue).
Reference Letter: A letter should be addressed to the
committee and be written by an individual familiar
with the applicant’s research, ideally, the research advi-
sor/mentor or major professor. Beyond comments con-
cerning the student’s general strengths, the letter must
address the following: 1) if the student will be prepared
to present the research project in the Plenary Session of
the upcoming Annual Meeting and 2) the student’s roleFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 55
in designing and conducting the research, especially in
the case of collaborative research. We seek to recog-
nize students that have been primarily responsible for
the design and/or conduct of the submitted research
project (normally the student’s thesis or dissertation
research). Any letter that does not clearly address the
two points stated above will result in disqualiﬁcation of
the applicant.
Evaluation criteria: Members of the Honoraria Com-
mittee review and rank applications based on original-
ity, quality, and presentation of the research and the ad-
visor’s letter of support. The three proposals with the
highest overall ranking will be awarded. Each award
carries an Honorarium of $1000, intended to subsidize

Eastern Standard Time on 15 February. Please also
email the chair of the committee [Virginia Hayssen,
vhayssen@science.smith.edu] at the time that you
submit your application. Questions should be directed
to honoraria@mammalsociety.org (or via snail mail to
Virginia Hayssen, Biology Department, Smith College,
Northampton, MA 01063 [413 585 3856]). Applications
that do not meet the above requirements or are
received after the deadline will not be considered.
Applicants will be notiﬁed of the committee’s decision
around 15 March.

Since 1977, the annual Young Scientists Summer Pro-
gram (YSSP) of the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, has
attracted 1500+ students from 70+ countries. The
YSSP 2010 will take place from June1 to August 27,
2010. IIASA is located in the former summer palace
of Austria’s royal family, ca. 15 km south of Vienna.
IIASA’s summer program oﬀers exceptional opportu-
nities for acquiring experience in an international and
interdisciplinary research environment. Research train-
ing is based on regular personal interaction with advis-
ing scientists, and typically leads to a publication in
an international journal, as well as to a chapter in a
candidate’s PhD thesis.

Summer ﬁeld research internships
Are you interested in gaining ﬁeld research experience
and learning about the evolution and ecology of plants
and plant-animal interactions in fragmented prairie?
We are looking for 3-5 summer ﬁeld researchers for
an NSF-funded project on habitat fragmentation of the
tallgrass prairie. We are investigating how small plant
population size inﬂuences inbreeding, demography, pol-
lination, and herbivory in the purple coneﬂower, Echi-
nacea angustifolia. This is a great summer internship
or co-op for those interested in ﬁeld biology or conser-
vation research.
No experience is necessary, but you must be enthusi-
astic and hard-working. You will survey natural plant
populations, measure plant traits in experimental plots,
hand-pollinate plants, observe & collect insects, and as-
sist in all aspects of research. Housing is provided and
there is a stipend. Undergraduate students have the
opportunity to do an independent project as an REU
participant.
If you want more information or wish to apply, please

Darwin biopic
Dear Colleagues
Many of you will have heard about or seen the new Dar-
win biopic “Creation,” which opened last Friday across
North America. Here in Atlantic Canada, and I un-
derstand elsewhere in Canada, the ﬁlm has been given
only extremely ’limited release.’ I suspect the same
is true elsewhere [NCSE: please advise]. From all ac-
counts, the ﬁlm deserves to be widely seen as a part of
a balanced consideration of science and faith; the star-
ring cast will no doubt bring in many who might not
otherwise attend.
We urge everyone to check local availability, and to
lobby for the widest possible distribution. The follow-
ing letter has prompted attention from CBC, and may
lead to a local ’Darwin Fest’ if there is no other means
to ensure local viewing.

Open Letter to the Editor, St John’s “Telegram” 27
Jan 2010
The year 2009 marked the 200th anniversary of the
birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of
the publication of his seminal work, “On the Origin of
Species,” regarded as the most inﬂuential book in the
history of biology. These events have been commemo-
rated across the world, for example by publication of
new editions of the “Origin,” and special lectures here
and elsewhere on Charles Darwin the man, his scien-
tiﬁc work, and the impact of evolutionary thinking on
society.
One such event is the release last Friday of the ﬁlm
“Creation,” starring Paul Bettany and Jennifer Con-
nelly as Charles and Emma Darwin. It examines the
marriage of the deeply religious Emma and her scientist
husband Charles, as they grapple with the implications
of his new theory for themselves and others. There
are ﬂashbacks to Charles’ ﬁve-year voyage around theworld, in which the evidence for evolutionary change
and natural selection ﬁrst became clear to him. As
such it combines biopic, adventure ﬁlm, and an explo-
ration of faith and science. “Creation” premiered at the
Toronto International Film Festival last Fall, to rave re-
views.
We are therefore dismayed to ﬁnd “Creation” in only
“limited release” in Atlantic Canada, at a handful of
theatres in Halifax and nowhere at all in PEI, New
Brunswick, or Newfoundland and Labrador. We sup-
pose the reasons are economic: however, at a time when
the federal Minister of Science has expressed doubts
about the reality of evolutionary change, more educa-
tion is needed rather than less.
As instructors in evolutionary biology at Memorial Uni-
versity, we urge Empire Theatres to reconsider its de-
cision, and release “Creation” as widely as possible in
Atlantic Canada, for the education and entertainment
of all students of science and others interested in the
very human story of this fascinating and important sci-
entist.

Disappearing DNA
Hello all,
In November ’09 I extracted DNA using Wizard SV 96
Genomic DNA puriﬁcation system in the 96 well plate
format. All steps were followed as per the protocol with
minor alterations (e.g. elution volume etc.). 1microL
of the DNA obtained was loaded onto a 0.8% agrose
gel (containing EtBr) soon after extraction. Typical
DNA yield was in the region of 20ng/microL. Recently
I have begun optimization for Microsatellite work, and58 EvolDir February 1, 2010
reloaded a few of the DNA plates on an Agrose gel
(Same as above). I’ve found that my DNA concentra-
tion is decreasing over time without intermediate degra-
dation i.e. the DNA does not appear as a smear but a
discrete band of the same size as the previous test.
Has anyone ever experienced this before, and if so could
you enlighten me as to what might be happening.
N.B. I have been reusing promega DNA binding plates
(in most cases for the third time). I have tested for con-
tamination with previous DNA and results were nega-
tive.
Thanks

Drosophila santomea genome
Drosophila santomea genome sequence (release 1.0)
Dear Evolution community,
This is to announce the release of a ﬁrst draft of the
Drosophila santomea genome sequence (release 1.0),
which can be downloaded at
http://genomics.princeton.edu/AndolfattoLab/-
Links.html D. santomea was ﬁrst described by
Lachaise et al (2000) as a new melanogaster-group
sister species endemic to the island of S˜ ao Tom´ e oﬀ
the coast of West Africa. D. santomea is most closely
related to D. yakuba and the two species diverged ~0.5
Mya (Cariou et al. 2001; Llopart et al. 2005; Bachtrog
et al. 2006). The species has a number of derivedcharacters relative to D. yakuba, including highly
reduced pigmentation and mating and temperature
preferences, making it fertile ground for studies of the
evolution of novel characters (Llopart et al. 2002;
Coyne et al. 2004; Carbone et al. 2005; Llopart et
al. 2005; Mas and Jallon 2005; Moehring et al. 2006;
Jeong et al. 2008; Matute and Coyne 2009). The
species is only partially reproductively isolated from
D. yakuba, facilitating the genetic dissection of the
factors underlying reproductive isolation and other
derived phenotypic traits of interest.
The current draft genome represents a bwa ( http://-
bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml ) assembly of 65.9
million 54 bp Illumina sequence reads to the D. yakuba
reference genome sequence (release 1.3) yielding an av-
erage coverage of ~10X. Further updates are expected
soon, including higher coverage with paired-end reads
and a de novo assembly in collaboration with Mike
Eisen at UC Berkeley.
We hope this will stimulate evolutionary genetic re-
search on D. santomea and other Drosophila species
- enjoy!

Microsat clustering
Greetings,
I am generating a microsatellite dataset across a large
genus of ﬂowering plants and am interested in using a
model-based clustering approach to guide species de-
limitation. My situation involves a large number (ca.
70) of morphologically distinctive but relatively young
diploid lineages that have presumably achieved pairwise
reproductive isolation but which still exhibit plenty of
trans-speciﬁc alleles.
I know that there are a number of model-based clus-
tering programs available, but that they diﬀer in their
underlying assumptions. Is there a good review dis-
cussing clustering at this level of divergence (above the
species level)? Any personal experiences with software
would also be greatly appreciated.

Institute. Mimulus is one of the ﬁrst completely se-
quenced plants in the large asterid clade of eudicots,
and is a long-standing model organism for ecological
and evolutionary genetics.
The assembly and annotation of the IM62 in-
bred line are available from Phytozome ( http://-
www.phytozome.net/mimulus ) for browsing, BLAST,
and download. The assembly consists of 321.7Mb ar-
ranged in 2216 scaﬀolds, with 6.5% gaps. For scaﬀolds,
N50 and L50=1.1 Mbp. 95.7% of the genome is in scaf-
folds larger than 50 Kbp. The genome annotation con-
tains 25,530 protein-coding loci. There is a separate col-
lection of 27,504 protein-coding transcripts from EST
sequencing of IM62 and other genotypes (and species).
These data are also being incorporated into a forth-
coming update of the mimulusevolution.org database,
which integrates the sequence data with genetic mark-
ers, maps and other information.
Terms of Use The Fort Lauderdale guidelines aim to
balance the value of rapid release of genomic data with
respect for the scientiﬁc interests of the generators of
that data. We ask that you respect these terms. Please
feel free to use these data to advance biology e.g. help
clone a gene, analyse a gene family, etc., though note
that this is a preliminary release, and undoubtedly in-
cludes various errors. Our plans for publication of the
Mimulus genome are focused on the large-scale analysis
of the gene and repetitive content of the genome and
its evolutionary dynamics (including synteny and chro-
mosomal/segmental duplication, gene family evolution,
gene structure evolution) relative to other angiosperms.
The initial manuscript describing the assembly, anno-
tation, and ﬁrst global analysis of the mimulus genome
will be based on an improved, chromosome-scale assem-
bly currently in development. If you have an interest in
using these data for large-scale analysis, or contributing
to a companion manuscript, please contact one of us.

*2 Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000 capillary DNA sequenc-
ing machines for sale (new price)*
We purchased these 2 instruments in early 2004 and
have been very satisﬁed with their performance over
the years, but they are no longer needed since we have
a 3rd Beckman CEQ 8000, which is suﬃcient for our
day to day sequencing needs.
Developed using Beckman Coulter’s extensive experi-
ence in laboratory automation and leadership in cap-
illary electrophoresis technology, the CEQ 8000 is a
fully automated genetic analysis system. It can be used
for DNA sequencing as well as fragment analysis (e.g.,
genotyping). This system automatically ﬁlls the capil-
lary array with a patented linear polyacrylamide (LPA)
gel, denatures and loads the sample, applies the voltage
program, and analyzes the data. Software tools let you
rapidly review data quality and even customize auto-
mated data assessment. With the CEQ 8000, you can
perform virtually all-genetic analysis functions with one
Gel, one Array and One Software Package.
2 units (complete with dedicated PCs, software and
user manuals) are available at $10,000 CAD each or

Software DAMBE update
Dear Colleague,
I just noticed that the DAMBE version I uploaded two
days ago included a test module instead of a release
module. It aﬀects the FastME method and a few func-
tions based on the maximum likelihood method. If you
do use these, please download the new version that I
have just uploaded.
I apologize for this inconvenience.

Software for drawing MSTs
Greetings, Evoldir:
I have generated a bunch of minimum-spanning trees
in Arlequin and would like to make ﬁgures of these.
Currently I am generating individual MST ﬁgures from
the Nexus data (using FigTree) and then editing this
in graphics software to make my ﬁgure. This is a very
time-consuming exercise (I am drawing the nodes as
circles with diameter proportional to the number of se-
quences at that node) and I was wondering if anyone
knows of a software package that can make this more ef-
ﬁcient. It would be nice if the software could also incor-
porate the information about alternative connections,
but any level of help would be greatly appreciated.

The Computational Genomics Group in the John
Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National
University (Canberra, Australia) have made pioneering
contributions to our understanding of genetic diversity
within and between mammal species in areas including:
the genomic distribution of linkage disequilibrium, hu-
man molecular adaptation, the inﬂuence of sex on mu-
tation rates, the relationship between epigenetic state
and genetic variation, and the radiation of mammals.
These contributions have been accompanied by signif-
icant methodology developments in the form of both
novel statistical models and open source software for
analyses of genomic diversity. Our recent advances in
models of context-dependent substitution, for instance,
represent a signiﬁcant advance in robust estimation of
the mode of natural selection.
We are seeking outstanding applicants for a postdoc-

FinnishMuseumNH BirdEvolution
The Finnish Museum of Natural History invites appli-
cations for the position ofFebruary 1, 2010 EvolDir 73
A Postdoctoral Researcher
to the project Origin and maintenance of phenotypic
variation. The project is funded by the Academy of
Finland and the Principal Investigator is Academy Re-
search Fellow Toni Laaksonen. The assignment will be-
gin on the 1st of February 2010 (or as otherwise agreed)
and last until the end of 2011.
The main aim of the project is to understand mecha-
nisms creating and maintaining variation in coloration
and other phenotypic traits, using as a model species
a passerine bird, the pied ﬂycatcher (Ficedula hy-
poleuca). The males in this species exhibit a plumage
trait complex that varies extensively both among and
within populations. The project uses a combination
of ﬁeld experiments, lab studies and analyses of long-
term data to reveal the roles of spatially and temporally
varying selection, gene ﬂow, and variable mating strate-
gies in the maintenance of this variation. Another main
question in the project is to examine the role of seasonal
interactions in life history and population dynamics.
The long-term monitoring data from the Museums ex-
tensive monitoring schemes furthermore provide a num-
ber of exciting possibilities to work on issues related
to avian responses to environmental change. The Post
doc project plan can be tailored according to the inter-
est and experience of the candidate within this broad
framework. An important aspect of the post doctoral
work is to support a PhD project on the migratory
connectivity between wintering and breeding areas (i.e.
on how the conditions experienced on the wintering
grounds in Africa carry over to the breeding grounds
and vice versa).
A person selected for the post of postdoctoral researcher
is required to have a doctoral degree and the ability to
do independent scientiﬁc work.
The salary will be based on level 5 of the demands level
chart for teaching and research personnel in the salary
system of Finnish universities and the job-speciﬁc com-
ponent of the salary will thus be EUR 2 578,53 per
month. In addition, the appointee will be paid a salary
component based on personal work performance.
The application should include a complete CV includ-
ing education and degrees obtained, prior research ex-
perience, publication list, a max. one page letter of
motivation explaining why you are interested in the po-
sition and why you would be suitable for it, and contact
information for referees.
The application with the attachments should be ad-
dressed to the Director Juhani Lokki and sent to hy-
kirjaamo@helsinki.ﬁ. The deadline for applications is
21 January 2010 at 15.45 local Helsinki time.For further information, please contact Toni Laakso-
nen, Academy Research Fellow, +358 9 191 28664 or

Two postdoctoral positions in phytoplankton traits and
models of community structure
We are looking for two postdoctoral researchers to de-
velop trait-based approaches to plankton ecology. One
position will focus on applying statistical approaches
to relate traits to phylogenies, environmental gradients,
and each other. The other position will develop trait-
based mathematical models. Ideally these two positions
will ﬁnd ways to collaborate.

raphy, limnology or related ﬁeld and a strong inter-
est in trait-based approaches and quantitative ecology.
The ﬁrst position requires familiarity with multivariate
statistics, the second position requires modeling experi-
ence, preferably trait-based modeling approaches (e.g.,
adaptive dynamics). For both positions, knowledge of
phytoplankton ecology, limnology, or oceanography is
a plus. These positions are supported by a recently
funded NSF grant “Phytoplankton Traits, Functional
Groups and Community Organization: A Synthesis”
and a grant from the James S. McDonnell Foundation,
“Plankton Community Assembly: Theory and Prac-
tice.”
The postdocs will be based at the Kellogg Bi-
ological Station of Michigan State University
(www.kbs.msu.edu ). Each position is for one year with
a possibility of renewal, given satisfactory performance.

basis of adaptation to novel environments, in particular
on the evolution of phenotype distributions in hetero-
geneous environments using populations of C. elegans
manipulated in their mating system and standing levels
of genetic variation. We aim to describe adaptation in
life-history, behavioral and gene expression phenotypes,
and correlate them with genome-wide patterns of DNA
sequence variation during long-term experimental evo-
lution. The speciﬁcs of the postdoctoral project will be
deﬁned according to the applicantˆ as interests and ex-
perience, and collaborations with labs in the USA and
Europe are envisaged.

Postdoctoral position in Plant Evolutionary Biology We
have National Science Foundation funding for a post-
doctoral associate (2-3 year appointment), with a start
date as early as June 1, 2010. Our groups conduct re-
search in the areas of natural hybridization, evolution-
ary genetics and speciation. Most of our research stud-
ies have involved plant taxa. Current projects continue
to emphasize both natural and experimental popula-
tions, and address conceptual issues from evolutionary
biology and ecology.
The successful candidate will have a strong background
in evolutionary biology and the ability to 1) collect
habitat data from natural plant populations, 2) geno-
type plants using microsatellite loci, and 3) analyze the
habitat and genotype data to test various evolutionaryhypotheses. They will work with the PIs and under-
graduate and graduate students in order to test the
eﬀects of ???reproductive isolation QTL??? on the ﬁt-
ness of plants in natural microhabitats and on introgres-
sion in natural hybrid zones between the Louisiana Iris
species, Iris fulva and Iris brevicaulis. Each of the stud-
ies is designed to reveal the factors that promote and
limit introgressive hybridization between these species
and thus aﬀect the evolutionary outcome of genetic
transfer events. These studies will thus test hypothe-
ses concerning the evolutionary importance of natural
hybridization and the processes leading to speciation.
Applications should arrive no later than April 1, 2010.

ULondon Adaptation
Dear All
We are seeking an enthusiastic, well-organized and ex-
perienced Postdoctoral Research Assistant for a two-
year position in the School of Biological Sciences, Royal
Holloway, University of London. This individual will
work on the NERC-funded UK portion of the CLIMI-
GRATE project, a part of the FP7 ERA-NET program
BiodivERsA.
The CLIMIGRATE project will generate ancient DNA
data from a suite of taxa to determine how species re-
spond to climate change at the population level. We
will use these data to evaluate, adjust and improve
existing forecasting models to more accurately predict
future responses. This work forms part of an inter-February 1, 2010 EvolDir 85
national collaboration between Dr Ian Barnes (RHUL,
London), Professor Nigel Yoccoz (Tromsø, Norway) and
Dr Love Dalen (Stockholm, Sweden) and will likely lead
to high quality publications.
The appointed researcher will work in a small dynamic
group and be responsible for their own research, in ad-
dition to playing a signiﬁcant role in running the lab-
oratory and supervising students. The exact focus of
the research is ﬂexible - several diﬀerent lines of re-
search are possible depending on the candidate’s back-
ground, experience and interests. Our general research
involves the use of DNA recovered from palaeontologi-
cal and archaeological remains - ancient DNA. We have
previously employed ancient DNA techniques to inves-
tigate mobility and population change in a range of
taxa including brown bears (Valdiosera et al. 2007,
Molecular Ecology 16, 5140; Barnes et al. 2002, Sci-
ence 295, 2267) and woolly mammoth (Barnes et al.
2007, Current Biology 17 1072); our current research
expands our taxonomic focus and methodological ap-
proach. We plan to develop our protocols to utilise
next-generation sequencing (particularly 454), and so
candidates with such experience would be particularly
well placed. However, the CLIMIGRATE project also
involves a signiﬁcant modelling component, so can-
didates with experience in bioinformatics/climate or
species distribution modelling, and an interest in in-
tegrating genetic data into this framework, are particu-
larly welcome (to work in collaboration with Nigel Yoc-
coz, Norway).
Candidates must be highly motivated, capable of in-
dependent work, and have a relevant degree and expe-
rience. Proven ability with the application of molec-
ular biology and/or modelling to ecological and evo-
lutionary questions is also essential. The position is
available for 2 years and is available from February
2010. Salary £31,838 pa inclusive of London allowance.
For informal enquiries please contact Dr Ian Barnes
(ian.barnes@rhul.ac.uk). The closing date for applica-
tions is midday, 29th January, 2010.

able online at http://www.rhul.ac.uk/personnel/Ads/-

*Postdoc on Adaptive Evolution in Plants*
*University of M1nster**, Germany***
*A postdoc position is available at University of
M1nster, in the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity.86 EvolDir February 1, 2010
The postdoc will join the lab of Juliette de Meaux and
work on the molecular basis of genetic adaptation in
/Arabidopsis thaliana/ and its relatives. We are look-
ing for a talented evolutionary geneticist interested in
the molecular details of genetic adaptation. The skills
of the applicants should be documented by high rank
publications in international journals. The successful
applicant will initially work on the consequences of life-
history evolution on the investment into immune com-
petence and defense. *The position is for two to ﬁve
years.* *The successful applicant will be encouraged to
develop his/her own research project within the frame-
work of our research. We especially encourage popula-
tion geneticists interested in testing the eﬀect of nat-
ural selection on functional variants. Experience with
the speciﬁcities of /A. thaliana/ as a model system is
NOT a pre-requisite. **
Since Fall 2005, the de Meaux lab has dedicated its ef-
forts to dissecting the molecular basis of genetic adap-
tation in /A. thaliana/. We combine population genet-
ics approaches with the tool kit of molecular biology
and functional genetics (and biochemistry) to charac-
terize the functional consequences of natural variation
and determine its evolutionary signiﬁcance. Work in
the lab has focused on various traits (seed dormancy,
innate immunity). Transversal approaches using newly
developed genomics tools are also used to understand
the evolutionary dynamics of speciﬁc types of molecu-
lar functions, e.g. /cis/-regulation. Initially located at
the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research
in Cologne, our lab is about to join the IEB in M1nster.
The IEB in M1nster is unique in Germany ( http://-
ieb.uni-muenster.de/ ). Its marked focus on Evolution
places it at the forefront of education and research in
diverse sectors of evolutionary biology, from evolution-
ary ecology to phylogenetics, population genetics and
evolutionary bioinformatics. This interdisciplinary en-
vironment, the diversity of model organisms as well as
close proximity to world class research at the nearby In-
stitute of Botany promises to bring you a highly inter-
active environment in which both your theoretical and
experimental skills can be harmoniously developed.
*M1nster is a multi-faceted city. It is a city of sci-
ence and learning. Westphalias longstanding regional
capital is a young city; one of 7 of its inhabitants is
either studying or employed by university and half of
its inhabitants are below 30 years of age. Compared
to other German cities, M1nster is a forerunner in the
ﬁeld of environment and climate protection. It is Ger-
many’s bicycle metropolis with more bikes than inhabi-
tants, more than 250 kilometres of bicycle paths and an
underground bicycle parking area in front of the main
train station. High-tech and traditional trade coexistin this city, as well as baroque noble residences and
modern architecture, or a historic city centre and pro-
gressive urban development. This is how M1nster can
guarantee you the highest quality of life. *

The postdoc fellow will work on the project ’Sperm,
speciation and promiscuity - An integrated analysis of
evolution in passerine birds’, funded by the Research88 EvolDir February 1, 2010
Council of Norway and NHM. Throughout the ani-
mal kingdom sperm cells are extremely diversiﬁed. In
passerine birds they show strong signatures of selec-
tion by sperm competition induced by female promis-
cuity. The intensity of sperm competition also varies
considerably among passerine species. The main aim
of the project is to advance our understanding of how
sperm cells evolve and diversify in a sperm competi-
tion context. The postdoctoral fellow will study the
evolutionary diﬀerentiation of sperm morphology and
behaviour within and among passerine species and as-
sess the importance of sperm competition as a driving
force in sperm evolution. The project will require the
use of a variety of analytical tools, like in-vitro sperm
motility analysis, high-resolution microscopy with digi-
tal imaging and morphometrics, and standard phyloge-
netic analysis and comparative statistics methods. The
project will include comprehensive ﬁeld work, especially
in the Macaronesian islands (Canary Islands, Madeira
and the Azores) where a selection of passerine species
will be used as a comparative model system for sperm
evolution.
The project team will consist of two postdocs, one
PhD student and one ﬁeld/lab technician, in addi-
tion to a network of international collaborators and
two senior NCB scientists: Associate Professor Ar-
ild Johnsen and Professor Jan T. Lifjeld (project
leader). The NCB is an interdisciplinary research cen-
tre in biosystematics and biodiversity which integrates

COURSE OBJECTIVES. - ANT COURSE is designed
for systematists, ecologists, behaviorists, conserva-
tion biologists, and other biologists whose research
responsibilities require a greater understanding of ant
taxonomy and ﬁeld research techniques. Emphasis
is on the identiﬁcation of the ant genera and species
occurring in Southeast Asia. Lectures will include
background information on the ecology, life histories
and evolution of ants. Field trips are structured
to teach collecting and sampling techniques, and
associated lab work provides instruction on specimen
preparation, sorting and labeling. Information on
equipment/supply vendors, literature, and myrmeco-
logical contacts are also presented.
COURSE SIGNIFICANCE. - Ant Course is a unique
opportunity to acquire training that is unavailable else-
where. This course will provide students with 1) the
conﬁdence and skills to identify the ant genera of tropi-
cal Asia; 2) an understanding of modern specimen pro-
cessing and curation techniques; 3) an appreciation for
the biological diversity of ants, and 4) experience keying
to the species level.
SPONSORS. -California Academy of Sciences and Mu-
seum of Comparative Zoology.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION. - ANT COURSE
will be taught from August 16 - 26, 2010 at
the Danum Valley Field Centre, Sabah Bor-
neo, ( http://www.etawau.com/PlacesInterest/-DanumValleyFieldCentre.htm ). The Station is
centered amid the richest ant fauna in Asia.
PARTICIPANT ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA. - ANT
COURSE is open to all interested individuals. Priority
will be given to those students for whom the course will
have a signiﬁcant impact on their research with ants.
An entomological background is not required. We aim
to include students with a diverse interest in biology,
including ant systematics, ecology, behavioral biology,
genetics, and conservation. The high instructor to stu-
dent ratio will allow students to receive individual at-
tention. ANT COURSE is presented in English and
limited to 30 participants.
COSTS. - Tuition for the 10-day COURSE is $475 for
current students and $675 for non-students. In addi-
tion, the Danum Valley station fees for this period, cov-
ering dormitory room and board, and ﬂights from Kota
Kinabalu to Lahad Datu and transfer to the station is
$750. Thus total costs for students is $1225 and non-
students $1425. Transportation costs between home
and Kota Kinabalu to be borne by all participants.
FELLOWSHIPS. - Four fellowships are available. Two
fellowships cover tuition fees and two fellowships cover
station fees. Students may apply for additional fellow-
ships to assist in travel. Those interested in attending
the course should seek all possible avenues to secure
funding for the course. You should only apply for an
Ant Course fellowship if you cannot ﬁnd other support
and it is essential for your participation in the course.
Beware that if you apply for an ant course fellowship it
implies that fellowship funding is essential to your par-
ticipation in the course. Thus, if you are not selected
for a fellowship, you might not be accepted into the
course. Please notify the course if your funding request
status changes before the application due date.

Postgraduate Course Consumer - Resource Interac-
tions: Danger, Disease and Density-Dependence
31 January - 4 February 2010
De Bergse Bossen, Driebergen, the Netherlands
All organisms require inputs of energy and/or materials
in order to grow and reproduce. Consumer-resource in-
teractions in all its variations (i.e. plant-nutrient, plant-
herbivore, predator-prey, host-parasitoid, and host-
parasite) are central to ecological and evolutionary re-
search. However, consumer-resource interactions are
also the basis of exploitative competition (two or more
consumers share resources), facilitation (one consumer
increases resources for another) and many mutualisms
(species trade ’resources’). Most organisms function as
both consumers and resources in a food web.
The functional and numerical responses of the con-
sumer and a function describing resource population
growth are essential components of any consumer-
resource interaction. Understanding these responses of-
ten requires that we understand the adaptive processes
V evolution, behaviour, and phenotypic plasticity V
that shape these interactions on both short and long
time-scales.
SCOPE OF THE COURSE This one-week course will
illustrate how adopting a consumer-resource approach
can change our understanding of interactions, and how
adaptive processes can be important in understanding
both academic and applied problems in ecology. The
course will focus on three selected topics within the
broad ﬁeld of consumer-resource interactions: Danger,
Disease and Density-dependence.
These topics will be introduced by world leading ex-
perts, with a focus on the latest developments and on-
going research eﬀorts.
The introductions will provide the starting point forpractical work by the participants to make the acquired
knowledge operational. To this end, sub-groups are
challenged to develop ideas for their own research: an-
alyzing their own data, writing a proposal, planning an
experiment, developing a model or writing a paper.
The experts and organisers will be available to all
groups during the practical work, allowing participants
intensive interaction with them. The main goal of the
course will be achieved if the participants acquire novel
ideas and techniques for their own research.
LECTURERS Peter Abrams (University of Toronto)
Joel Brown (University of Illinois at Chicago) Bob
Holt (University of Florida) Don DeAngelis (Univer-
sity of Miami) Han Olﬀ (Groningen University) Theu-
nis Piersma (Groningen University, Royal Netherlands
Institute for Sea Research)
COURSE SET-UP On Sunday evening, we start with
guest lectures by Han Olﬀ and Theunis Piersma. On
Monday, the basics of consumer-recourse interations
and the topics will be introduced. Then groups will be
formed. During the following days, there will be three
one-hour lectures on speciﬁc topics, followed by discus-
sion. The rest of the day will be spent on the practi-
cal work, under the supervision of the experts and the
organisers. On the last day, the groups present their
practical work to all participants.

Portal Arizona Phylogeography
Apr4-9
Course Advertisement: Statistical Phylogeography
course at the AMNH Southwestern Research Station
near Portal, Arizona.
This course will cover several advanced topics in model-
based approaches to the analysis of phylogeographic
data, including those based on Monte Carlo simulations
and parametric bootstrapping, approximate Bayesian
computation, various power analyses, species delimita-
tion, and hypothesis testing. Participants will be asked
to bring their own data to the course, and the design
and implementation of analyses for individual data sets
will be emphasized. To facilitate these analyses, stu-
dents will learn some basics of UNIX and R.
Course requirements: participants must bring a lap-
top computer running either Mac OSX or Linux op-
erating systems. We suggest that participants install
R and PERL prior to arrival, as well as several other
open source programs (ms, seq-gen, msBayes, popABC,
DIYABC, STEM, Mesquite, ). Participants will have
access to wireless internet at the SWRS, and will be
encouraged to conduct analyses remotely on servers at
their universities.
Prospective students should send a brief
letter and a CV by January 20, 2009 to
swrs.statistical.phylogeography <at>gmail.com .
In the letter, please indicate how model-based phy-
logeography would enhance your research program
and describe the data that you would like to analyze.
We prioritize participants with data from empirical
systems that can be analyzed during the workshop.

ideas through discussions in groups - thinking critically
and expressing oneself clearly - turning a general idea
into a research project - writing a research proposal
and defending it It is you, the students, who will be in
charge in this course. You will be divided in groups of
4-5 students. In those groups, you will work on your
ideas. You, as a group, will decide what the important
questions in broadly deﬁned evolutionary biology are,
you will choose one, and attempt to develop a proposal
for a research project that will address it. The faculty
will visit the groups during the discussions to answer
your questions, provide coaching and give you feedback
on your projects, but they will generally take the back
seat. Additionally, the faculty will give informal talks
about their research and be available for discussion with
individual students. At the end you will present your
projects to other participants, and we will party.
*Costs*: CHF 420.- for room and board.

Workshop on Molecular Evolution, Woods Hole
http://www.molecularevolution.org/workshop 25 July
- 6 August 2010, individual research session 6 - 13 Au-
gust 2010
Application Deadline 1 March 2010
Michael P. Cummings, Director
The Workshop on Molecular Evolution has been the
ﬁnest course on the subject since ﬁrst oﬀered in 1988
in Woods Hole, USA. The Workshop consists of a se-
ries of lectures, demonstrations and computer labora-tories that cover various aspects of molecular evolution.
Faculty are chosen exclusively for their eﬀectiveness in
teaching theory and practice in molecular evolution.
Included among the faculty are developers and other
experts in the use of computer programs and pack-
ages such as BLAST, BEAST, Clustal W and Clustal
X, FASTA, FigTree, GARLI, Genealogical Sorting In-
dex, LAMARC, MAFFT, MrBayes, PAML, PAUP*,
and SeaView who provide demonstrations and consulta-
tions. The course is designed for established investiga-
tors, postdoctoral scholars, and advanced graduate stu-
dents with prior experience in molecular evolution and
related ﬁelds. Scientists with strong interests in molec-
ular evolution, phylogenetics, population genetics, and
related ﬁelds are encouraged to apply for admission.
Lectures and computer laboratories total ~90 hours of
scheduled instruction. An optional all-computer labo-
ratory of 54+ hours of independent work with guidance
and consultation of some faculty and teaching assistants
is oﬀered during the third week. Admission is limited
and highly competitive, with admissions decisions de-
termined by an international committee. Participants
ﬁnd the individual research session to be especially use-
ful.
Topics to be covered include:
- Databases and sequence matching: database search-
ing: protein sequence versus protein structure; homol-
ogy; mathematical, statistical, and theoretical aspects
of sequence database searches - Phylogenetic analysis:
theoretical, mathematical and statistical bases; sam-
pling properties of sequence data; Bayesian analysis;
hypothesis testing - Maximum likelihood theory and
practice in phylogenetics and population genetics: coa-
lescent theory; maximum likelihood estimation of pop-
ulation genetic parameters - Molecular evolution inte-
grated at organism and higher levels: population bi-
ology; biogeography; ecology; systematics and conser-
vation - Molecular evolution and development: gene
duplication and divergence; gene family organization;
coordinated expression in evolution - Comparative ge-
nomics: genome content; genome structure; genome
evolution - Molecular evolution integrated at lower lev-
els: biochemistry; cell biology; physiology; relationship
of genotype to phenotype
2009 Fees: $2650 (room and board at no additional
charge), plus an additional $1000 for the individual re-
search session.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
