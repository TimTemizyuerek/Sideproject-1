SPATIAL EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS WORK-
SHOP Institut des Systemes Complexes (ISC), Paris,
October 17, 2008 This workshop addresses the spe-
cial features of evolutionary dynamics that occur in ex-
plicitly spatial models compared with traditional mean
ﬁeld models.
The aim is to bring together scientists studying the
eﬀects of spatial extent (“isolation by distance”) and
conﬁguration on evolutionary dynamics. Authors are
invited to submit a 1-page abstract on their research, or
on a review and discussion about any aspect of spatial
evolutionary dynamics. Contributions may be original
or already published (please specify when submitting).
Keynote speaker: Paulien Hogeweg <http://www-
binf.bio.uu.nl/ph >Organizing committee: Guy
Hoelzer and Rene Doursat Workshop Website: http:/-6 EvolDir October 1, 2008
/www.iscpif.fr/SED2008 OVERVIEW Evolutionary
theory remains largely entrenched in the lessons of
mathematical models assuming well-mixed popula-
tions, or sets of subpopulations without any spatial con-
ﬁguration (the so-called “island model” of migration),
which cannot exhibit the emergence of spatial pattern
or its inﬂuence on evolutionary rates. However, these
behaviors have been routinely observed in spatially ex-
plicit computational models of the evolutionary process
(usually agent-based) developed in recent years, and
they represent general aspects of complex systems the-
ory.
This is a very important trend for evolutionary theory
as diversiﬁcation of types is the central concept of evo-
lutionary biology. Darwin established this as the core
idea of evolution with the title of his book on “the ori-
gin of species”. Now is an ideal time to identify and
characterize the spatially explicit computational mod-
eling approach for understanding the evolutionary pro-
cess. There have been over 100 papers published explor-
ing spatially explicit computational evolution models,
which appear to present a consistent message revealing
inadequacies of neo-Darwinistic mean-ﬁeld models and
calling for a new understanding of spatio-temporal evo-
lutionary dynamics. For example, extending models of
evolving populations in one or more spatial dimensions
seems to frequently (always?) tend toward spatial self-
organization (population subdivision/speciation) and
enhance ecological and social adaptation (including the
evolution of cooperation). We hope that interactions
during this workshop will help to clarify which aspects
of traditional evolutionary theory are generally chal-
lenged by these models.
To give an example, here is a link to a re-
cent paper by the organizers exploring parap-
atric speciation in the absence of environmen-
tal inﬂuences: http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/-

ABSTRACTS * Important Dates: >* Deadline for
abstract submission: Tuesday, September 30 >* No-
tiﬁcation of acceptance: Friday, October 3 * Abstracts
should be submitted electronically by email addressed
to both organizers: Guy Hoelzer ( hoelzer@unr.edu )
and Rene Doursat ( rene.doursat@polytechnique.edu ).
* The number of speakers is limited to 12 and the to-
tal number of attendees to 35. * Submissions will be
reviewed based on their relevance to the workshop, clar-
ity, and overall quality. * If you only want to attend
without giving a presentation, please notify the orga-
nizers by email. * There is no registration fee for this
workshop.
TOPICS OF INTEREST While we anticipate that
most presentations will describe particular models andtheir behavior, contributions and viewpoints about the
following topics are especially encouraged:
* Similarities and diﬀerences in modeling approaches
and assumptions. * Similar and dissimilar outcomes
(behaviors) of alternative spatially explicit evolution-
ary models or empirical examples. * To what extent do
our eﬀorts represent a major paradigm shift for evolu-
tionary biology. If this is a signiﬁcant paradigm shift,
then how do we most eﬀectively communicate the new
perspective to colleagues during the transition? * What
role should traditional mean-ﬁeld theory of population
genetics play in the future? * Can we begin to pre-
scribe a framework to guide the development of future
spatially explicit computational models of evolution? *
Finally, what possible transfers and applications could
be created toward artiﬁcial evolution of spatially dis-
tributed devices?
PROGRAM The details of the program will be an-
nounced once we have a list of scientists interested in
presenting at the workshop. All speakers will be asked
to give relatively brief (around 30mn) presentations
about their models and/or views about such models.

population genetics and conservation biology. This year
a workshop will be held from 26.11.2008 to 28.11.2008
in Salzburg, one of Austriaˆ as most attractive towns.
The main goals of the workshop are to stimulate the in-
teraction between wildlife diversity and animal breed-
ing research as well as to integrate quantitative and
molecular approaches to the estimation of ﬁtness asOctober 1, 2008 EvolDir 7
conservation value. The following invited lectures of
experts will be presented:
Whatˆ as in a breed: criteria for conservation (J.A.
Lenstra) Cranes, primates and zebu cattle: a rational
framework to derive conservation priorities (H. Simi-
aner) Genetics of African cattle domestication and sig-
natures of selection (D. Bradley) Functional tests of

SanFrancisco ElementsEvolution
Dec10-15
Greetings! There will be a session at the 2008 Fall AGU
Meeting in San Francisco, CA, of special interest to the
EvolDir community. The title of the session is “Ele-
ments and Evolution”. The session description is given
below. We are particularly keen on making this as inter-
disciplinary and exciting as we can by welcoming evo-
lutionary biologist, geneticists, bioinformaticians, and
all other biology types to join us.
We encourage you and your research colleagues, post-
docs and students to consider contributing and attend-
ing.Please spread the word!
Note that the deadline for Fall AGU abstract submis-
sion is SEPT. 10. The meeting dates are Dec. 10 -
15.
We hope to see many of you there!

Session No: B42
Title: Elements and Evolution
Organizers: A. D. Anbar, K. Konhauser, F. Wolfe-
Simon
Featured speakers (conﬁrmed): S. Benner, A. Kappler,
T. Lyons, F. Morel and M. Saito
Living things are comprised of a non-random selection
of major biogenic elements (C, H, O, N, P and S) and
trace metals (e.g., Fe, Cu, Ni, Mo and V). The abun-
dances of these elements in the oceans, and their chem-
ical forms, have changed dramatically through time,
particularly in response to the progressive oxygena-
tion of the oceans and atmosphere. The evolutionary
consequences of the intersection between biochemistry
and Earth history are likely to be profound, but at
present are only dimly discerned. A key obstacle to
progress is that researchers informed about the evo-
lution of Earth’s surface chemistry rarely overlap with
those concerned with the elemental requirements of mi-
crobes. This session seeks to bring together researchers
studying the element requirements of organisms from
multiple perspectives, ranging from molecular biology
to ecology to those studying changes in element avail-
ability and associated environmental conditions across
multiple timescales.

Greetings!!
We would like to invite the submission of abstracts re-October 1, 2008 EvolDir 9
lated to “native ﬁshes propagation, stocking and ge-
netic management” for the Colorado River Basin Sci-
ence and Resource Management Symposium to held in
Scottsdale, Arizona November 18-20, 2008. Evolution-
ary theory has provided insight into the dynamics of
ﬁsh population for decades, and we would welcome ab-
stracts focused on how evolutionary processes aﬀect ﬁsh
populations, and how that information can be used to
guide management decisions. While the meeting is fo-
cused on the Colorado River system, we would welcome
examples of how genetics is used to enhance ﬁshery
management in other regions. The meeting informa-
tion, including abstract submission information, is lo-
cated at the Watereducation.org website.

give participants a holistic view of how genetics and
related ﬁelds are best applied to solving conservation
problems, both in situ and ex situ. Target participants
are graduate students or working professionals based
in Latin America, who are still designing or have be-
gun the initial stages of a thesis or other project. A
unique strength of this course is that all instructors
work presently with the conservation of Latin American
species. The Workshop thus seeks to increase not only
participant knowledge of theory and practical analyses,
but also informal exchanges among those in the region
active in this ﬁeld. Classes will be given in Spanish, al-
though some instructors speak Portuguese as well. The
course format combines formal lectures with group dis-
cussions, computer labs, and participant presentations
of their ongoing or planned research.

participating instructors, as well as instructions about
pre-registration and applying for ﬁnancial aid, can be

AboAkademi CrypticColoration
PhD student position: Cryptic coloration as an anti-
predator adaptation
How does natural selection for concealment shape the
appearance of animals? What makes a colour pattern
diﬃcult to detect? How does the visual habitat and
the behaviour of the animal inﬂuence the evolution of
its colour pattern? Cryptic coloration decreases the
risk of its bearer becoming detected. It is a common
adaptation that intrigued the minds of early evolution-
ary biologists and is currently receiving an increasing
amount of attention from researchers.
This PhD student position is available at the ˚Abo
Akademi University, Turku, Finland ( www.abo.ﬁ ) and
is ﬁnanced for 4 years. The PhD project will focus on
natural selection on cryptic coloration in prey animals.
In other words, it will address questions about how prey
should optimise its colours and patterns to decrease itsrisk of becoming detected under various conditions, and
how selection for crypsis shapes the appearance of prey.
The speciﬁc questions will be chosen together by the
student and the supervisor. This project enables the
use of a range of diﬀerent approaches from experimental
(e.g. birds searching for artiﬁcial prey items) to theo-
retical ones, and from studies on the visual appearance
in speciﬁc taxa and their natural habitats to the study
of selection on appearance in artiﬁcial systems. The
project can best be described as behavioural ecological.
Further information can be obtained from and ap-
plications should be sent to Sami Merilaita (e-mail:
sami.merilaita@abo.ﬁ; address: Environmental and
Marine Biology, Biocity, ˚Abo Akademi University, FIN-
20520 Turku, Finland; phone: +358-(0)2-2153355).
The application should have arrived no later than Oc-
tober 20, 2008.

I welcome students who want to pursue fundamental
work in any area of evolutionary ecology. My own work
combines mathematical modeling (adaptive dynamics)
and bacterial evolution experiments to examine feed-
backs between ecological and evolutionary dynamics. I
am also developing a project to quantify spatial and
temporal variation in relative ﬁtness of soil bacteria in
the ﬁeld. A current student project in my lab exam-
ines how selection pressures on alpine plants are medi-

UGeorgia PlantFungiEvolution
The Sheﬀerson lab in the Odum School of Ecology at
the University of Georgia is currently recruiting two
PhD students for the Fall semester of 2009. Our lab
has a broad theme in evolutionary ecology, with partic-
ular interests in life history evolution, symbioses, and
conservation, especially as they pertain to plants and
fungi. We are a multi-disciplinary lab, and use phy-
logenetic, quantitative genetic, molecular, and demo-
graphic approaches in theoretical and empirical experi-
ments to answer questions. We hope to attract students
broadly interested in any of these themes. Please see
the Sheﬀerson lab website for some of the current re-
search ( www.sheﬀersonlab.com ).
The Odum School of Ecology at the University of Geor-
gia is the ﬁrst stand-alone school of ecology in the US.
It consists of a large and vibrant group of top-notch
faculty, students, and researchers. We interact with bi-
ologists in the Dept. of Plant Biology, Dept. of Genet-
ics, Dept. of Environmental Health Sciences, Warnell
School of Forestry, College of Agricultural and Envi-
ronmental Sciences, and others, as well as the nearby
US Forest Service Research Stations and Agricultural
Extension. The University of Georgia also includes a
diverse array of ﬁeld stations both within state and
abroad, particularly in the tropics. Students joining
the lab may enter either through the Odum School, or
through the umbrella program in Ecology, Evolution,
and Organismal Biology currently being developed.
Interested students should contact Dr. Richard
Sheﬀerson directly via e-mail (dormancy@uga.edu)
to inquire about the position. Informal inquiries are
welcome, and those with more motivated interest
should send a CV and a letter explaining your interest
in the lab. All applicants will need to submit a formal
graduate student application with the University of
Georgia (see the Odum School of Ecology website
for further details at http://www.ecology.uga.edu/-

UIllinois Biodiversity systematics
Graduate Student Research Assistantships in ecological
genomics, tropical biodiversity and systematics
Graduate Student Research Assistantships are avail-
able (Summer/Fall 2009) for outstanding students in-
terested in integrating one or more disciplines, includ-
ing evolutionary and ecological genomics, comparative
phylogenetics, and biodiversity and taxonomy. The re-
search examines the remarkable coevolutionary inter-
dependencies between tropical parasitoid wasps, which
depend upon a wide array of tropical forest herbivores
for growth and development of oﬀspring, and the mutu-
alistic polydnaviruses carried by the wasps to suppress
the immune systems of their hosts. These viruses are
fully integrated into the wasp genome, providing an un-
usual opportunity to investigate symbiont induced spe-
ciation. What are the roles of polydnaviruses in the
evolution of host speciﬁcity and diversiﬁcation of the
wasps? The hyperdiverse wasp species and their viruses
also oﬀer opportunities for taxonomic and tropical bio-
diversity research. See www.life.uiuc.edu/whitﬁeld for
descriptions of current projects and recent publications.
Those interested in training and research in the follow-
ing NSF and USDA funded projects, please read on.
A student with interests in phylogenomics and bioin-
formatics will have access to comparative genomic data
from 40+ polydnavirus genomes, which are being se-
quenced from a variety of closely related species of bra-
conid parasitoid wasps. The molecular phylogeny of
the wasps, an ongoing project, when complete will be
used to identify genes, genetic changes and adaptations
associated with host shifts of the parasitoids.
A student interested in tropical ecology, biodiversity
and systematics of parasitoid wasps can develop re-
search in association with large-scale surveys of Lep-
idoptera underway in Costa Rica and Ecuador. This
research involves synthesizing taxonomic and ecologi-
cal information from thousands of caterpillars and their
parasitoids collected from the ﬁeld and reared in situ.
The majority of species will be new to science and will
shed light on poorly known faunas. Multiple scientiﬁcquestions are open to energetic, independent students.
This work involves several institutions, including the
Guanacaste Conservation Area in Costa Rica, Yanay-
acu Biological Station in Ecuador, the University of
Pennsylvania, and Tulane University, allowing consid-
erable opportunities for collaborative research.
Interested applicants may apply either through the
Department of Entomology or the Program in Ecol-
ogy, Evolution and Conservation Biology (PEEC) at
the University of Illinois. Admissions information can
be found on the relevant links at www.life.uiuc.edu/-
entomology/admissions.html and www.life.uiuc.edu/-
peeb/index.htm . Prospective candidates should have
strong academic records and some research experience
as Masters or undergraduate students. The assis-
tantships are tailored to motivated, energetic students
interested in scientiﬁc careers, who can work both in-
dependently and collaboratively, enjoy problem solving
and are well organized. Review of applications will be-
gin immediately and continue until candidates are se-
lected.
Please send to Dr. James Whitﬁeld (jwhit-
ﬁe@life.uiuc.edu) via electronic pdf attachment: 1) a
statement of interest in the project and the skills you
would bring, 2) a CV including GPA and GRE scores,

FOUR YEAR PhD SCHOLARSHIP IN BE-
HAVIOURAL EVOLUTION AT VALLADOLID
UNIVERSITY TO STUDY SOCIALITY AND ULTI-
MATE FUNCTION OF COGNITION IN CARRION
CROWS
A four-year funded PhD scholarship is available at the
University of Valladolid (Spain) to investigate the re-
lationship between sociality and cognition in carrion
crows.
Recent investigation on diﬀerent corvid species has re-
vealed surprisingly advanced cognitive abilities that
sometimes rival those of non-human primates. In some
species the individuals proved to possess the “theory
of mind”, that is the ability of attribute mental states
and intentions to other individuals, and to modify their
own behaviour according to the intentions attributed to
others. Sociality is though to be a key factor promoting
the evolution of intelligence, which appears to be more
advanced in species that live in stable groups. However,
the adaptive function of intelligence in these species is
not yet clear, as it is not fully known how these cogni-
tive abilities are used in nature, what kind of problems
they contribute to solve, and how they inﬂuence indi-
vidual decisions in a changing social environment. We
intend to address questions about social environment,
cognitive abilities, adaptive function of intelligence and
cooperative solution of problems in carrion crows kept
in captivity.
Supervisors: Dr Vittorio Baglione (University of
Valladolid); Dr Daniela Canestrari (University of
Granada). The net stipend, according to Spanish schol-
arship system, is around 1120 Euros/month

TheoreticalPopulationGenetics
PhD Position in Theoretical Population Genetics at the
University of Vienna
The mathematics and biosciences group (MaBS, home-
page www.mabs.at ) at the University of Vienna is look-
ing for a strong and highly motivated candidate for a
PhD position in evolutionary modeling and statistical
data analysis.
Research environment: Vienna is not only one of the
world’s most liveable cities, but also oﬀers an excellent
research environment and currently develops into one
of the main centers in evolutionary research in Europe.
The position will be located at the Max F. Perutz Lab-
oratories, part of Vienna’s strong bioscience campus.
Project: Due to modern methods of high-throughput
sequencing, huge amounts of DNA sequence data from
population samples (“polymorphism data”) are avail-
able today. Interpretation of these data is an important
task for theoreticians. In the project, we will develop
novel methods to detect so-called footprints of selection
in DNA polymorphism data. These footprints can be
used to describe the pattern of recent adaptations on agenome. We will particularly focus on eﬀects of popula-
tion structure and spatially variable selection on genetic
footprints. We will use mathematical methods based on
stochastic processes (coalescent theory) and extensive
computer simulations. The project is part of an in-
ternational DFG-research group “Natural Selection in
Structured Populations” in collaboration with groups
in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Munich,
and Mathematics at the University of Freiburg.
Conditions: The position is for three years, salary is
according to the FWF standard rates for PhD students
in Austria. The starting date is ﬂexible (November 08
or later).
Application: We are looking for a candidate with a
strong background in quantitative methods (analytical
or computational modeling or data analysis) and inter-
est in evolutionary research. Applicants should have a
Master / Diploma degree in natural science (e.g. biol-
ogy or physics), mathematics, or bioinformatics . Pro-
gramming skills are highly appreciated. The working
language in the group is English. German skills are
not essential. The reviewing process will start in mid
October 2008 and will continue until the position is
ﬁlled. Applications should include a CV, letter of inter-
est, and the names and email addresses of two potential
referees. Applications and informal inquiries should be
sent (preferably as a single pdf) to Joachim Hermisson

Host-parasitoid coevolution: The role of para-
sitoid adaptation to endosymbiont-mediated defence in
aphids
A 3-year PhD position funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation is available in the Ecology group
of the Institute of Zoology at the University of Z¨ urich,
Switzerland. The project deals with antagonistic co-
evolution as an evolutionary force maintaining genetic
variation. Our study system is the black bean aphid,
Aphis fabae, and its parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum.
It was shown recently that aphids may rely on ’helpers’
in the form of facultative endosymbiotic bacteria for
defence against parasitoids. Coevolution is thus me-
diated by endosymbionts in this system. While the
aphid-symbiont association is currently under intensive
investigation, little is known about the role of para-
sitoids in the interaction. However, just as parasitoids
select for improved defences in hosts, the host’s acquisi-
tion of defensive symbionts selects for counterdefences
in parasitoids. Parasitoid adaptation to defensive en-
dosymbionts in hosts will therefore be the main focus of
this project. The work will combine ﬁeld sampling and
population genetic analyses with targeted experiments
in the laboratory, including an experimental evolution
approach.
I seek a highly motivated candidate with a strong in-
terest in evolutionary ecology and genetics. Candidates
should have a MSc or equivalent in biology. Experience

Te Papa MSc Scholarship in Molecular Systematics at
Victoria UniversityTe Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand and Vic-
toria University of Wellington are oﬀering a Master of
Science (MSc) scholarship in the ﬁeld of molecular sys-
tematics at Victoria University. The purpose of the
award is to promote research between Te Papa and Vic-
toria University in the area of molecular systematics,
ecology and evolution.
An MSc degree at Victoria University is undertaken
over two years (Parts 1 and 2) and involves four courses
worth equal marks, plus a research thesis worth 60% of
the total. The Te Papa-VUW scholarship provides the
successful applicant with a student stipend of $4000
in part 1 (2009) and $6000 in part 2 (2010). The
project oﬀered in 2009-2010 will be a molecular system-
atic investigation of the New Zealand species of Pseu-
dopanax (Araliaceae) or Gleichenia (Gleicheniaceae), or
another project to be determined. The thesis research
will involve the DNA sequencing of chloroplast and nu-
clear genes, with complementary morphological anal-
yses, and will address phylogenetic questions such as
the relationships between species and generic bound-
aries, as well as issues of biogeography and species-
delimitation. The ideal applicant will have completed a
BSc degree and have an interest in New Zealand plants
and molecular phylogenetic techniques.

Vienna FunctionalPopulationGenet
PhD Program in Population Genetics (Vienna)
Topic: Natural populations carry a wealth of molecular
variation and there is increasing evidence that a large
proportion of it is functionally diverged. Thus, under-
standing the functional implications if natural variation
provides insight into the adaptation processes in natu-
ral populations.
After the ﬁrst phase in the genomics projects, which
were focusing on the sequencing of one genome for each
species, the emphasis has now shifted to the genome
wide characterization of natural variation. In particu-
lar the new generation of sequencing technology (454,
Solexa etc.) is contributing to a hitherto unprece-
dented wealth of information about naturally occur-
ring sequence variation. Nevertheless, the advances in
cataloging natural variation are not matched with ouradvances in understanding the functional diﬀerences
among the naturally occurring alleles.
Our PhD program aims to train a new generation of
scientists that is able to deal with this new challenge.
Compared to classic forward genetics, which typically
isolated mutations with strong eﬀects, naturally occur-
ring alleles are expected to show only subtle diﬀerences
in function, which may nevertheless have dramatic ef-
fects in nature. Hence, the analysis of natural variation
requires new approaches and tools to understand the
functional diﬀerences of naturally occurring alleles.

ResearchContracts EvolutionaryBiol
- DEADLINE: September 30!!
CIBIO is a young and highly dynamic Research Centre
located close to Porto, in the north of Portugal, which
aims to be an international Centre of Excellence in the
ﬁelds of Biodiversity and Evolution, oﬀering great op-
portunities for multidisciplinary research. The Centre
occupies recently-built facilities, and now has approxi-
mately 55 researchers holding a PhD degree and more
than 50 MSc and PhD students, as well as people from
many diﬀerent countries. The working atmosphere is
vibrant and enthusiastic, and the CIBIO is regularly
visited by many scientists from abroad. The Cen-
tre has fully equipped molecular laboratories (multiple
PCR rooms, automated sequencers, real-time PCR ma-
chines, etc), as well as technicians, and the necessary
equipment for ﬁeldwork. In 2007, we were able to get
7 research positions, and successful research scientists
came from places as diﬀerent as Colorado, Alaska, Utah
and Montpellier, among others, to work in molecular
phylogenetics, biodiversity and conservation, theoreti-
cal population genetics and plant evolution. For 2008,
we are now advertising seven 5-years full research con-
tracts ( www.eracareers.pt ), and expect to recruit en-
thusiastic and highly motivated researchers in the areas
indicated below. The positions are expected to start by
the end of 2007.
1. Genetics of host-parasite interactions
A 5-year research position, renewed yearly, is available
at CIBIO ( http://cibio.up.pt ), Portugal, in the area of
genetics of host-parasite interactions. Although the ex-
act ﬁeld of research is open, the researcher is likely to
work on the study of genetic variation at host candidate
genes that confer resistance against diseases, possibly
using the European rabbit as a model species, because
these are prime candidates for undergoing adaptive evo-
lutionary change. It would be desirable if the candi-
date had previous experience working with immuno-
genetic markers (namely MHC, immunoglobulin genes,32 EvolDir October 1, 2008
cytokine and chemokine receptors), with particular fo-
cus on the molecular evolution of such genes as well as
detection of natural selection and recombination events.
The candidate must have a PhD and a minimum of 3
years postdoctoral experience. A sound knowledge of
molecular evolution will be reﬂected in the candidate?s
Curriculum Vitae, that evidences a signiﬁcant publi-
cation record in SCI journals for the above-mentioned
topics. Experience is expected in the supervision of
postgraduate students (both MSc and PhD theses) and
on the preparation, development and coordination of
scientiﬁc projects. The candidate is expected to estab-
lish solid international collaborations, and be able to
attract national and international funding. The candi-
date should also be a good communicator (speaking and
writing ﬂuent English) and may participate in teaching
at MSc and PhD levels. Candidates will be assessed ini-
tially on their CV, followed by a job interview. Salary
corresponds to a gross annual income of 43000 euros
(before taxes).
2. Sexual selection and mating systems
A 5-year research position, renewed yearly, is available
at CIBIO ( http://cibio.up.pt ), Portugal, in the area of
behavioural ecology and evolution. Applicants should
have a PhD Degree in Biology and a minimum of 3
years of research experience at post-doc level, prefer-
ably in the ﬁelds of ecology and animal behaviour. The
researcher is expected to integrate a Behavioural Ecol-
ogy & Evolution research group and will study animal
behaviour from a multidisciplinary perspective, com-
bining experimental analysis of behaviour with ecolog-
ical and evolutionary work. Among the main research
topics to be covered, special attention will be given
to the evolution of mating systems, sexual selection
and other reproduction related topics. Given the on-
going environmental alterations, a clear focus will be
devoted to the analysis of some of the above-mentioned
subjects in populations that inhabit the extremes of
a species geographical distribution. As such, the can-
didate is expected to have experience in studying an-
imal behaviour, both in the laboratory as well as in
the ﬁeld, and show solid knowledge in experimental de-
sign and biostatistics. Since some of the model organ-
isms expected to be used are mainly marine, a diver?s
certiﬁcate may be considered useful. Additional key
requirements involve excellence in research, translated
into a signiﬁcant publication record in SCI journals on
the above stated topics, proven ability to build up in-
dependent research initiatives, such as established in-
volvement in the development, preparation and coor-
dination of research projects, PhD student supervising
experience and a clear vision on national and interna-
tional research priorities. A history of conference atten-dance and organisation will also be considered valuable.

Technician job in conservation genetics: habitat frag-
mentation and large mammals of Borneo
*****
NOTE: DEADLINE 15 SEPT 2008 !!!
The Population and Conservation Genetics group
(http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/research/unit/88 ) is
looking for a technician to work on the impact of
fragmentation on large mammals from Borneo. The
project will involve both lab, ﬁeld and simulation work
in collaboration with L. Chikhi (in Portugal) and B.
Goossens (in Malaysia).
The candidate is expected to work in close collabora-
tion with a post-doctoral researcher who will be hired
on the same project. Since the post-doc and techni-
cian are expected to be complementary, we are open
regarding the proﬁle that the technician should have.
S/he could thus be a biologist with a strong interest for
modelling, a biologist working in the laboratory or a
theoretician/computer scientist with an equally strong
interest in biological problems, and software develop-
ment. Excellence and adaptability are the main selec-
tion criteria.
The Month Stipend follows the regulations of the FCT
Scientiﬁc Fellowships in Portugal (745.00/month) andwill initially be for 24 months. NOTE THAT THIS IS
TAX-FREE.
The post-doc will be based at the Instituto Gulbenkian
de Cienciaˆ a (IGC, http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ )
which is a leading Research Institute in Portugal and in
Europe. Researchers at the IGC work on a wide range
of subjects from epidemiology, to genetics, evolution-
ary biology, bioinformatics and theoretical immunology.
The IGC is located in Oeiras, a small sea-side town 20
min. by train from downtown Lisbon, along the Tagus.
It is only 10-15 min. walking distance from the beaches
and the quality of life is excellent. The IGC provides
excellent research conditions and English is the commu-
nication language among and within groups. Several
other research institutions are located near-by address-
ing both fundamental and applied questions in biomed-
ical sciences using interdisciplinary approaches.
Applications in PDF format will be accepted by email
only (to chikhi at igc.gulbenkian.pt) until September
15th, 2008, and will include:
-a short CV
-a motivation letter
-two recommendation letters (sent independently by
referees) or contacts of two referees.

MalariaEvolution
Graduate research assistant required, to work on the
evolutionary ecology of malaria parasites
A Wellcome Trust funded research assistant position is
available immediately for a highly organised and mo-
tivated graduate with a degree in a biological science
subject. You will work with and assist members of Dr
Sarah Reece’s lab on a variety of projects to investigate
the evolution and ecology of the transmission biology
of malaria (Plasmodium) parasites. Current projects
including asking questions such as how, why and when
does to social and in-host environment of parasites in-
ﬂuence traits such as investment into growth and re-
production, sex allocation, virulence and programmed
cell death.
The work is interdisciplinary as it involves testing the
predictions of evolutionary ecology using new molecular
and cell biology methods as well as standard parasito-
logical techniques. Lab work routinely involves main-
taining infections in rodents and mosquitoes, and col-
lecting parasites for culture. Data collection usually in-
volves monitoring parasites as their infections progress
and when challenged with diﬀerent scenarios, such as
anti-malarial drugs, competition with other parasites,
and anaemic or immune hosts. The project involves
work with rodents and some weekend work will be re-
quired.
The position would suit an enthusiastic recent gradu-
ate whose degree has a strong parasitology, evolution
or ecology component and an interest in evolutionary
medicine. Experience with molecular techniques (e.g.
PCR) and working with rodent models would be an
advantage but are not essential. You will be able to
work as pat of a team to develop new techniques, carry
out experiments and collect the resulting data. You
will also be able to work independently to maintain
the lab’s records of parasite stocks, safety informa-
tion and carry out pilot work. Our website provides
more detailed information, links to relevant publica-
tions and contact details for informal enquiries ( http:/-46 EvolDir October 1, 2008
/homepages.ed.ac.uk/sreece/ ).
The role is grade UE06 and attracts an annual salary
of GBP 23692 to 27466 per annum for full-time hours
(35 hours per week), dependent on age and experience,
and is oﬀered for 1 year in the ﬁrst instance, extendable
up to 51 months.

A 9-month position for a senior visiting scientist ex-52 EvolDir October 1, 2008
perienced in theoretical community ecology and/or
coevolutionary theory is available at the Univer-
sity of Potsdam (close to Berlin/Germany). The
position will start on 1 December 2008 or later
(e.g. spring or summer 2009) and forms part
of the Marie Curie Transfer of Knowledge Project
FEMMES (FEedback Mechanisms in Models for Eco-
logical forecastS) (for Marie Curie Transfer of Knowl-
edge see http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/mariecurie-
actions/action/knowledge en.html ). FEMMES aims to
develop innovative models that describe how dynamic
feedbacks between diﬀerent hierarchical levels (from
genotypes to communities) aﬀect the response of eco-
logical systems to environmental change. The project
runs over a period of 4 years, comprises a total of ﬁve
positions for visiting scientists, and is jointly hosted by
the Department of Plant Ecology and Nature Conser-
vation, and the Department of Ecology and Ecosystem
Modelling.
The visiting fellow will be based at the Department
of Plant Ecology and Nature Conservation, a research
group with broad experience in the development of
individual-based and spatially-explicit ecological mod-
els (e.g. Grimm et al. 2005 Science 310: 987-991). In
collaboration with host scientists and a FEMMES Post-
doc, the fellow will develop a concept for the integra-
tion of feedbacks between the dynamics of communities,
populations and genotypes into models of community
response to environmental change. In particular, we
aim to better understand at which timescales diﬀer-
ent hierarchical levels respond to environmental change
and to clarify the relative importance of these changes
for community dynamics. Details of the research to
be conducted at Potsdam (including possible focal sys-
tems) are open to discussion and should be linked to
previous experiences and current research interests of
the fellow and the host. Ongoing research projects of
the host combine theoretical and empirical work on the
response of genotypes, populations, species and com-
munities to habitat fragmentation, the ecology and evo-
lution of invasive plant species, the ecological dynam-
ics of populations and species under climate change,
and the spread of transgenes in populations of crop
plants and trees (see also www.bio.uni-potsdam.de/-
professors/plant-ecology-and-nature-conservation ).
Applicants should have at least 10 years of research ex-
perience, should be non-German, and should not have
resided in Germanyfor more than 1 year during the past
3 years. Germans are eligible if they have resided out-
side the EU for at least four of the last ﬁve years (for de-
tails see http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp6/mariecurie-
actions/action/level en.html ).

Agarose gel stains
Hello:
I have recently started a new lab and would like to ex-
plore less toxic alternatives to Ethidium Bromide stain-
ing of agarose gels. Although I am aware of SYBRSafe,
I have not used it. Also, I have heard about dyes like
Crystal VU (methyl violet stain from Genlantis) that
do not require UV to visualize, but I think sensitivity
suﬀers. Thus, I would like to poll the EvolDir commu-
nity for their experiences and recommendations.
Certainly, any chemical that binds to DNA should be
handled with caution, but I am hoping to reduce tox-
icity and minimize accumulation of hazardous waste.
Cost and sensitivity are of concern, although for the
most part I am just ’checking’ genomic DNA, PCR
products, etc. Additionally, it would be convenient
if the solution could be incorporated directly into the
agarose gel (no post-staining). Also, I typically useSB (sodium borate) buﬀer for agarose gels (a switch
from TBE or TAE that I highly recommend - lower
cost, equally eﬀective, and not exothermic like tris-
based buﬀers so you can run gels faster - but that’s
a story for another day). Has anyone tried these stains
with SB buﬀer?
I also would be interested to know what gel documen-
tation systems (homemade or commercial) people are
using to visualize these gels. Any that come highly rec-
ommended (or that I should run away from)?
I appreciate your candid comments and will of course
compile and post responses.
Thanks, Emily

Binary ancestral states
Greetings,
I am currently in search of a software that can read
binary data (each row representing a species, each col-
umn representing presence(1)/absence(0) of a feature
across all species) and reconstructs the ancestral state,
based on an evolutionary tree, for each column using a
Maximum Likelihood algorithm.
I have looked at Mesquite, but the performance con-
cerns me a little as the ﬁle is very large (10k columns...).
Something like Phylip’s Dolly Parsimony program, just
ML based, would be great.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
With kind regards,
Marc

Bottleneck simulations
Hi, I am interested in the detection of population ex-
pansion/decline using microsatellite data and full like-
lihood statistical approach. I am familiar with Beau-
mont’s methods (i.e. MSVAR) but as far as I can tell
this method only considers one change on population
size from n0 (eﬀective population size before popula-
tion’s size change) to n1(current eﬀective population
size) . Are there any methods available to model a
population decline (bottleneck) followed by a rapid ex-
pansion? I can imagine modelling something like [no
to n1 (-negative log(r)-) + n1-to n2 (-positive log(r)-).
Is that possible? I am not sure if the genetic signa-
ture of the expansion erases the one of decline. If so,
can I distinguish between population expansion after a
bottleneck or population expansion without a previoussigniﬁcant reduction in population size?
Thanks in advance,

living things share a common ancestry. >Although
there are legitimate debates about the patterns and

limited to “intelligent design,” to be introduced into

But you can only sign it if you have a doctorate and are
named “Steve” or some variation thereof. At last count
they had 895 members and are pushing to cross 900 so
they can make new t-shirts that say “more than 900

Fish phylogeny genes
Hello,
I am a new PhD student working on Poeciliids. I am
looking for advice on nuclear genes to use for a phy-
logeny of Xiphophorus. The problem with genes such
as RAG-1 is that withing the genus Xiphophorus there
is hybridization and many of the species are closely re-
lated, thus genes like RAG-1 do not provide a very good
resolution.
I recently read a paper describing 10 new genes for ﬁsh
phylogeny (Li et al. 2007 Evolutionary Biology) - has
anybody tested these and had success?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

IntragenomicVariation DataAnalysis
We would like to compare the variation of a genetic
marker between individuals, and between diﬀerent pop-
ulations. However, this is a multi-copy nuclear marker
(from the rDNA cistron) which shows some level of in-
tragenomic variation (SNPs). This variation can be ob-
served when the PCR product from the same individual
is cloned and several clones are sequenced.
Is there some standard way how to design a data collec-
tion (sequencing, cloning, potential analysis of multiple
clones from the same individual...) to be able to evalu-
ate the among-individual or population variation prop-
erly, taking into account for the possible intragenomic
variation?
Thank you, Justyna Wolinska

IntragenomicVariation DataAnalysis
answersDear Evoldir Members, Thank you for your response to
my question about the intragenomic variation (multi-
copy nuclear marker): how to deal with that when we
want to to evaluate the among-individual or population
variation. See the answers below.
Best regards, Justyna Wolinska
>From Richard Nichols: You might wish to consider
the pyrosequencing approach that we implemented
to look at the frequency of rDNA variants within
individuals, between individuals and between popula-
tions. It is published in Keller, Veltsos & Nichols 2008.
THE FREQUENCY OF rDNA VARIANTS WITHIN
INDIVIDUALS PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF POPU-
LATION HISTORY AND GENE FLOW ACROSS A

844 http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/-
120084325/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0
>From Magdalena Zarowiecki: Your ﬁrst problem is
to ﬁnd out how much intra-genomic variation there
really is. If you are cloning, it is well-known that
you will introduce a much higher mutation rate, so
the intra-genomic variation you see is most likely
just cloning-error. When I sequence ITS2 from PCR
products, I sometimes ﬁnd variation within individuals,
but in this case there are clear double-peaks in the
sequence chromatograms, and there is only a small
number of polymorphic sites. If you do cloning you
shouldn’t ﬁnd any variation in cloned products that
you don’t ﬁnd when you sequence PCR product from
the same individual. If you do, it is cloning-error.
If you can map your SNPs by sequencing a subset,
you can always just do PCRs followed by restriction
enzyme digestion to score variation within individuals
for your bulk sample. To evaluate among-individual
and population variation you should do an hierarchical
AMOVA, as in Arlequin for example.

similar things with sponges, which have been pub-
lished in MPE in 2004. W¨ orheide, G., Nichols, S.,

rDNA internal transcribed spacers in sponges (Phylum
Porifera): implications for phylogenetic studies. Molec-
ular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 33(3), 816-830.
>From Nathaniel Jue: We have found some signiﬁcant
error rates in data when using a general Taq instead of
one with a proofreader. Errors came from both PCR
reactions and the processing of clones, if you haven’t
checked that out, it might help you out with repeata-
bility issues.

Mallard samples
Dear all,
for my PhD project I need to blood collect samples from
mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The scope of sam-
pling should also involve the British Isles. Therefore I
am searching for direct contact to mallard hunters who
are willing to discuss with me the possibility of helping
me in any respect with this. One from somewhere in
Ireland, one from (roughly) the northern half of Britain,
and the last from (roughly) the southern half. I would
like to get into contact because I am interested in blood
samples from there. We will be going with the hunters
to the places where they hunt and ourselves will do all
the work (which is not much, maybe 3-5 minutes per
shot mallard). We just need to know when and where
to go, and maybe a little help with transport from a
train station or bus stop or so. But I will discuss these
details with the hunters directly when they are inter-
ested.
You might be a hunter yourself or know somebody per-
sonally who might connect me further. Any hint is
welcome.
Thanks in advance,
Cheers,
Robert

add-in that facilitates construction of msat input ﬁles
(among other things). All links point to the animal ge-

time-out). Perhaps someone has the add-in ﬁle lying
around their computer somewhere and could send that
along to me? It was a great little program and I’m sorry
to have lost it when I switched to a new computer.
Any help would be much appreciated!

Pipetting automation
Hello everybody, We are planning to purchase pipet-
ting automation to increase our sample throughput and
maintain good sample quality. Our needs include auto-
mated DNA extraction (from tissue), automated PCR
set-up, and liquid handling (from tube to plate, from
96-well to 385-well).
We have been looking at Corbett’s X-tractor for the
Nucleic acid extraction. For liquid handling and PCR
set up have been looking at Corbett’s CAS-series and
also Beckman Coulter’s Biomek FX, which apparently
could handle all the above mentioned tasks (with ap-October 1, 2008 EvolDir 65
propriate ALPs). Therma Scientiﬁc sells Matrix Hydra
II for automated pipetting and other systems too.
We would greatly appreciate any comments on end-user
experience about these or any other automated systems
in this ﬁeld. Especially interesting would be to have in-
formation on actual walk-away time, cost eﬀectiveness,
frustration barometer, etc. Thanks in advance!

Portugal VolFieldAssist
OtterBehaviouralEvolution
I,m seeking enthusiastic undergraduates and recent col-
lege graduates who are interested in collaborate, as vol-
unteer or carrying out their Master or Final Degree
Thesis, in a ﬁeld research on the European Otter (Lutra
lutra) in Portugal. The overall objective of my research
program is to study the behavioural ecology of the ot-
ters. More in detail, Iˆ am trying to understand the re-
lationships between the use of space of this species and
the availability and dispersion of the resources, namely
freshwater and food. This could be of particular in-
terest in an ecosystem, like the Portuguese one, which
is strongly inﬂuenced by summer droughts and heavily
altered by humans (by creating many reservoirs).
I’m carrying out a PhD of the University of
Rome (Italy) with Prof Luigi Boitani ( http://-
dipbau.bio.uniroma1.it/web/Docenti/Docente364/-
index.htm ) as advisor, and Iˆ am collaborating with
the Prof Ant ¨Inio Mira, the head of the Conservation
Biology Unit of the University of ˜Avora ( http:/-
/www.ubc.uevora.pt/ ).=0AThe ﬁeld work started
at the end of June 2007, at present we caught 19
otters (including escapes and recaptures), marked and
followed 10 of them (of which 2 died), and many others
will be hopefully caught and followed soon.
Successful applicants will assist with ﬁeldwork (consist-
ing of trapping sessions, radiotracking, prey sampling
and collection of environmental data) in our Study Area
(Alentejo, South of Portugal), and with data entry. Inaddition, they could develop their own individual re-
search projects on a topic related to the program and
their own interests, with the opportunity to carry out
their Final Degree/Master Thesis, and, if particularly
motivated, to be involved in the publications. Please
notice that the position is unpaied. This means that
successful applicants should provide by theirself for the
logistic (accommodations and living expenses), with the
only luck that here the cost of life it is not prohibitive.
Strong motivation to work in extreme environmental
conditions, during both nights (mainly) and days; En-
glish/Italian/Portuguese speaking skills and a valid Eu-
ropean Driverˆ as license are required. Class background
in animal ecology, zoology, statistics, and experience
in radiotelemetry techniques would be an advantage.
Competent, enthusiastic, and emotionally mature peo-
ple desired! Students could apply starting from now
and until February 2009, starting to work as soon as
they could or as will be planned together with me.

qPCR data analysis software
Dear EVOLDIR members,
we are currently performing a study on gene expression
response in environmentally impacted ﬁsh populations.
To analyse later on results and perform some advanced
statistical analysis, we are considering bying a qPCR
analtysis software (for relative quantiﬁcation mainly) to
enable us to do clustering (for catagories), multivariate
and regression analyses with other environmental data
(we do not have the relative quantiﬁcation module of
ABI).
We would like to know of people that have used GenEx
(MultID)or qBASE (Gazelle) what they would suggest
(or other softwares I don’t know of). I tested GenEx
and it seemed perfect for our purposes, but I would
like to know if there are major problems I might have
overlooked.
I would be happy to receive any relevant input.66 EvolDir October 1, 2008

Software FastTree 1 0
We announce the release of FastTree 1.0, a tool for in-
ferring minimum evolution trees from large alignments.
FastTree is slightly more accurate than other minimum-
evolution methods such as neighbor joining, BIONJ or
FastME, and is up to 10,000 times faster. For exam-
ple, FastTree inferred a phylogeny for an alignment of
39,092 proteins, including support values, in half an
hour on a desktop PC.
New features in this version of FastTree:October 1, 2008 EvolDir 67
Nearest-neighbor interchanges – After inferring an ini-
tial topology with a heuristic variant of neighbor join-
ing, FastTree reﬁnes the topology with nearest-neighbor
interchanges according to the minimum-evolution crite-
rion.
Local bootstrap – FastTree uses the local bootstrap to
quickly estimate the reliability of each split.
Log-corrected distances – For nucleotide sequences,
FastTree uses Jukes-Cantor distances. For protein se-
quences, FastTree uses log-corrected distances based on
the BLOSUM45 amino acid similarity matrix.
FastTree is available at http://-
www.microbesonline.org/fasttree and a
manuscript describing it is available at http:/-

Software OrthoMaM version 4
update
Dear Evoldir members,
During the summer, we have released OrthoMaM ver-
sion 4: a major update of our database of mammalian
orthologous single-copy nuclear exons.
It can be queried at:
http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/ The new ver-
sion 4 is based on EnsEMBL release v49 and now in-
cludes 6,116 exons and 12,484 CDS candidate markers
for 25 taxa.
Major changes from the previous version include:
* Requests on 25 taxa (based on EnsEMBL v49 March
2008) with the new inclusion of Equus (horse) and
Pongo (Orangutan) ;
* Inclusion of both complete CDS and individual exon
data ;
* Query results can now be click-sorted according to
descriptors and downloaded as .zip archives ;
* The average responsiveness of the web server has been
signiﬁcantly improved.
Details:OrthoMaM version 4 ( www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr )
is a major update of the database of orthologous
mammalian markers. Primarily based on EnsEMBL
version 49 annotation and orthology assignment, Or-
thoMaM v4 includes 6,116 single-copy orthologous ex-
ons of length >400 base pairs from the 25 complete
mammalian genomes currently available. This set of 1:1
orthologous exons can be searched for potential phylo-
genetically informative markers at diﬀerent taxonomic
levels of the mammalian tree by querying a number
of evolutionary descriptors that have been inferred us-
ing a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline. Moreover, Or-
thoMaM v4 provides the complete set of 1:1 orthologous
coding sequences (12,484 CDS) for this 25 mammalian
species with the corresponding multiple sequence align-
ments made available for download both at the nu-
cleotide and amino acid levels. The improved graphical
interface allows the user to browse and download the
results of combined queries with more ﬂexibility.
The article describing the database is freely available

Caltech Synthetic Selﬁsh Genetic
Elements
CALTECH: Selﬁsh genetic elements, insects, popula-
tion modiﬁcation
ENGINEERING THE GENETICS OF WILD INSECT
POPULATIONS WITH SYNTHETIC SELFISH GE-
NETIC ELEMENTS Mosquitoes are essential vectors
for major human diseases such as dengue, yellow fever
and malaria. An attractive approach to suppressing
these diseases involves replacing the wild insect popu-
lation with modiﬁed counterparts unable to transmit
disease (population replacement). An essential compo-
nent of such a strategy involves the use of a genetic
drive mechanism able to promote the spread of genes
conferring disease resistance, even if their presence re-
sults in a ﬁtness cost to carriers. We have developed
a synthetic selﬁsh genetic element (Medea) that is able
to drive population replacement in Drosophila (Chen
et al., (2007) A synthetic maternal-eﬀect selﬁsh genetic
element drives population replacement in Drosophila.
Science. 316: 597-600).
Postdoctoral positions are available to develop and
characterize Medea elements in mosquitoes and other
organisms at the molecular, genetic andpopulation lev-
els. We are also interested in the development of novel
selﬁsh genetic elements able to bring about local pop-
ulation elimination, and in methods for engineering re-
productive isolation. Population genetic engineering is
an exciting new research area with many opportuni-
ties. Postdoctoral candidates should hold recent Ph.D.
and/or M.D. degrees.
Postdoctoral positions are also available to study the
basic biology of microRNAs, cell death and spermato-
genesis in Drosophila and mosquitoes.
We (http://www.its.caltech.edu/˜haylab/ ) are an ener-
getic and well- funded team with modern lab space lo-

PopulationGenetics of
SelfIncompatibility
Applications are invited for a three-year OCE Post-
doctoral fellowship to develop mathematical simulation
models of the genetic and demographic dynamics of self-
incompatibility in invasive plant populations.
The successful applicant will be a mathematical popu-
lation modeler or ecological geneticist with experience
in developing simulation models that integrate both ge-
netic and demographic processes. The main responsi-
bility will be to work with a small team of molecular
population geneticists and plant ecologists to develop
population models to explore how self-incompatibility
aﬀects invasive plant population dynamics using wild
radish as a primary model system.
As a member of the research team you will also under-
take glasshouse experiments to determine the impor-
tance of dominance relationships in determining evolu-
tionary dynamics of self-incompatibility and the long-
term eﬀects on reproductive performance.
You will have excellent written and oral communication
skills and the ability to work as part of a team.
Candidates should have, or will shortly satisfy the re-
quirements for a PhD in population genetics or ecolog-
ical genetics with strong experience in mathematical
simulation modelling and should have no more than
three years of work experience since graduation.Full information available online at: https://-

A 2-year postdoctoral fellowship is available to work on
the genetics and molecular evolution of wing patterns
in Heliconius butterﬂies.
Butterﬂies in the genus Heliconius are well known for
their spectacular wing-pattern radiation, which makes
them a unique model to study the genetics of morpho-
logical and evolutionary adaptation. We are especially
interested in the evolutionary genetics of a balancedOctober 1, 2008 EvolDir 73
polymorphism for mimicry in the species H. numata,
controlled by a single locus (supergene) with many al-
leles. We are aiming to understand the evolution of
this genetic architecture and to characterise the genes
controlling pattern variation. Approaches range from
linkage mapping to molecular population genetics and
evo-devo, taking advantage of a rich comparative frame-
work at the genus level, and using a rapidly increasing
amount of genomic information for this group. Possi-
ble projects include (but are not restricted to): - ge-
netic dissection and evolution of supergenes - popu-
lation genetics and/or spatial molecular evolution of
balanced polymorphism - molecular evolution of ge-
nomic sequences linked to a supergene - genomic evo-
lution of wing pattern formation. A ﬂavour of our
current research in Heliconius butterﬂies can be found
onhttp://heliconius.zoo.cam.ac.uk/joron/ andhttp:/-
/www.heliconius.org . The successful candidate will
join a new team lead by Mathieu Joron and funded by
CNRS at the Natural History Museum. The postdoc
will have the opportunity to collaborate closely with
local evolutionary biologists, postgraduate students, as
well as with international collaborators from the Heli-
conius Consortium.
The Natural History Museum ( www.mnhn.fr ) is situ-
ated right in the centre of Paris, next to Universit´ e
Pierre & Marie Curie (Paris 6), and a short walk from
Ecole Normale Sup´ erieure. The Natural History Mu-
seum has recently enjoyed an intensive campaign of re-
cruitment of young researchers in all aspects of biodi-
versity and evolutionary research, and Paris as a whole
has a vibrant research community in the life sciences.
The position is for 2 years, starting in January 2009
or soon thereafter. Gross salary is 27.000-41.000 per
annum depending on experience. A PhD and a strong
background in evolutionary biology or genetics are re-
quired. Good skills in the molecular lab are essen-

elling, a biologist working in the laboratory or a the-
oretician with an equally strong interest in biological
problems. Excellence and adaptability are the main
selection criteria.
The Month Stipend follows the regulations of the FCT
Scientiﬁc Fellowships in Portugal (1495.00/month) and
will initially be for 18 months but the successful candi-
date will be encouraged to apply for independent fund-
ing from international or Portuguese funding bodies.
The post-doc will be based at the Instituto Gulbenkian
de Cienciaˆ a (IGC, http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ )
which is a leading Research Institute in Portugal and in
Europe. Researchers at the IGC work on a wide range

ary biology, bioinformatics and theoretical immunology.
The IGC is located in Oeiras, a small sea-side town 20
min. by train from downtown Lisbon, along the Tagus.
It is only 10-15 min. walking distance from the beaches
and the quality of life is excellent. The IGC provides
excellent research conditions and English is the commu-
nication language among and within groups. Several
other research institutions are located near-by address-
ing both fundamental and applied questions in biomed-
ical sciences using interdisciplinary approaches.
Applications in PDF format will be accepted by email

Postdoctoral position available in the Department of
Genetics (17 Sept 2008)
A Postdoctoral position in bioinformatics is available
in the Aquaculture Division, Department of Genetics,
Stellenbosch University with the project title “Genetic
improvement of the abalone Haliotis midae.”
Haliotis midae, known locally as ’perlemoen’, occurs
along the Western, Southern and Eastern shores of
South Africa and is the only one of the six species thatOctober 1, 2008 EvolDir 75
occurs in South Africa that is commercially exploited.
H. midae displays a very slow growth rate, taking two
to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an obstacle
in the proﬁtable farming and global competitiveness of
this species. In order to increase the productivity and
the proﬁtability of the commercial activity, a research
program has been designed that makes use of the mod-
ern technology currently applied to other aquaculture
species. One of the outputs of the project is to produce
a transcriptome sequence of Haliotis midae using the
Illumina Genome Analysis platform.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for bioinformatic data analysis within this framework.
This will include developing an in-depth understanding
of tailored analytical software packages for EST, tran-
scriptome and gene expression analysis to both con-
duct research and provide postgraduate students with
bioinformatics support; keeping abreast of new devel-
opments in the areas of bioinformatics, transcriptome
analysis and abalone research; the input of data into
and maintenance of a comprehensive sample tracking
system; assisting laboratory staﬀ and students with
their research data output requirements.
Minimum requirements: PhD with specialization in
Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Genetics, Genomics or
a closely related discipline. Candidates should have a
strong computational background (DNA sequence anal-
ysis, phylogenetic analysis and gene expression data
analysis) and proﬁciency in relevant software packages.
Recommended requirements: Project management ex-
perience; excellent organizational and communication
skills; proven ability to set deadlines and meet mile-
stones; a desire to work as an eﬀective member of a
growing team.
The position is available for 2 years (January 2009 -
December 2010)

FungalPopulationGenetics
Postdoctoral Position Department of Plant Pathology,
University of California, DavisA three-year postdoctoral position is available, start-
ing November 2008, for population genetics research
on the ascomycete fungus Eutypa lata, causal agent of
Eutypa dieback of grape. Although it is clear that E.
lata ascospores are the infectious propagules and are
wind-dispersed, the origin of ascospores that initiate
the ﬁrst infections in a healthy vineyard is not known.
Eutypa lata is a generalist pathogen with a broad host
range that includes not only grape, but also many or-
chard trees, ornamentals, and native hardwoods. To
identify the potential source and routes of infection,
as determined by genotyping isolates, research will ini-
tially rely on polymorphic microsatellite markers, pre-
viously developed, to compare populations of Eutypa
from vineyards, wildlands, and Prunus orchards (apri-
cot & cherry) from an existing collection of isolates.
Some outcomes of this initial project will be to clar-
ify species concepts for Eutypa from grape and Eu-
typa from Prunus, to test for migration between pop-
ulations from vineyards and orchards in California and
from other continents, and to improve our understand-
ing of the pathogen?s population biology. The postdoc
will then be responsible for designing additional studies
that build on the initial project and test hypotheses re-
garding recombination rates and evolutionary histories.
Applicant must understand the principles of popula-
tion genetics and coalescent theory. Applicant must
also have demonstrated proﬁciency with computational
methods in population genetics and phylogenetics,
which includes the application of appropriate software
speciﬁc for analyzing microsatellite and sequence data
(e.g., GeneMapper, Arlequin, MrBayes, MIGRATE,
STRUCTURE, GenePop). This research project is one
component of a large, multi-state, multi-lab eﬀort fo-
cused on control of grapevine trunk pathogens, includ-
ing E. lata. The postdoc will, therefore, also be re-
sponsible for supervising research assistants to main-
tain a greenhouse experiment on the relative resistance
of grapevine cultivars to infection by E. lata and other
trunk pathogens. A recent Ph.D. (within one year of
completing PhD) in ecology, mycology, genetics, plant
pathology, microbiology, or a related scientiﬁc discipline
is required. Salary is commensurate with experience,
but will not be less than $35,000 per year, and medical
insurance for the postdoc is a beneﬁt provided with this
appointment. UC is an AA/EOE employer.

Telomeres as biomarkers of costs and quality in the Sey-
chelles warbler
UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA - SCHOOL OF BI-
OLOGICAL SCIENCESSENIOR RESEARCH ASSOCIATE Ref: RA519
28,290 to 33,780 per annum (pay award pending)
A NERC funded postdoctoral position is available from
December 2008 for a period of two years and nine
months. The goal of the research is to use the unique
correlative and experimental data set compiled on the
Seychelles warblers to undertake a comprehensive lon-
gitudinal study of telomere shortening in a wild avian
population. The study will address a fundamental
problem in evolutionary biology; namely how to mea-
sure and compare the costs that individuals pay when
participating in diﬀerent activities/experiences in their
natural setting. The accurate estimation of such costs
is essential to our understanding of the trade-oﬀs in-
herent in the evolution of life histories. The work will
be undertaken with Dr David S Richardson and part-
ners involved in the overall Seychelles warbler project
(J Komdeur and T Burke) and the speciﬁc telomere
work (P Monaghan and S Verhulst).
The researcher will help to develop molecular protocols
to screen for telomere length in the Seychelles warbler.
They will then; 1) determine whether telomere shorten-
ing be used as a measure of biological aging in this wild
population, 2) investigate the relative costs, in terms of
telomere shortening, of diﬀerent stresses, and, 3) test
the idea that individual variation in telomere shorten-
ing rate can reﬂect an individuals ability to withstand
these stresses and, therefore, provide an indicator of
individual quality.
Applicants must have, or be about to obtain, a PhD
in a relevant discipline such as evolutionary or be-
havioural ecology and have a keen interest in under-
standing life history trade-oﬀs and senescence. Prac-
tical experience in modern molecular techniques, such
as PCR/sequencing, is essential. Field experience and
animal handling are desirable as there may be the op-
portunity to participate in ﬁeldwork.

yses.
RESEARCH PROJECT: Identiﬁcation of genes under-
lying adaptive phenotypic traits is of primordial im-
portance in the ﬁeld of evolutionary biology. It is an
extremely challenging task, even more for non-model
organisms. This research project is aimed at identify-
ing genes or biological functions that are more likely
to undergo adaptive evolution in animals. The selected
candidate will perform a new experimental genomic ap-
proach developed in the laboratory for isolating fast
evolving transcripts that show typical signs of positive
selection. This high throughput method will be per-
formed on a highly derived group of Neotropical cat-
ﬁshes, the Loricariina, due to their outstanding range
of phenotypic, ecological and behavioral traits. This
project is founded by a SNF grant.
Other groups in the Department of zoology and animal
biology focus on molecular biology of vertebrate devel-
opment (Denis Duboule), artiﬁcial and natural evolu-
tion (Michel Milinkovitch), molecular phylogeny of pro-
tists and invertebrates (Jan Pawlowski), developmen-
tal and molecular biology of sensory systems in mam-
mals (Ivan Rodriguez), genetic and cellular regulation
of developmental plasticity in Hydra (Brigitte Galliot),
oogenesis in zebraﬁsh (Roland Dosch), genomic silenc-
ing in Drosophila (Pierre Spierer), Hox genes regulation
in Drosophila (Fran¸ cois Karch), sex determination and
early development in Drosophila (Daniel Pauli), vascu-
lar cell physiology (Jean-Louis B´ eny).
Ideal candidates will have a PhD in evolutionary bi-
ology (phylogenetics, population genetics, developmen-
tal genetics), should be experienced in laboratory tech-
niques (e.g. DNA, RNA extraction, PCR and RT-
PCR, DNA sequencing, cDNA library, cloning, ...),with strong skills in DNA sequence analyses and in the-
oretical aspects of molecular evolution. The position is
initially for two years. The selected candidate will be
encouraged to apply for funding in order to develop his

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE Ref:
R3926
Salary Grade 7 - £29,866 to £34,624 per annum
(Salary subject to outcome of October pay review)
A NERC-funded postdoctoral position is available im-
mediately for a strongly motivated individual to study
behavioural and genetic aspects of nest building be-
haviour in a ﬁsh, the three-spined stickleback. The aim
of the research project is to quantify population varia-
tion in nest building behaviour and separate the relative
roles of adaptive divergence and phenotypic plasticity,
using behavioural ecological and molecular genetic ap-
proaches.
A series of experiments will be undertaken using stick-
lebacks from diﬀerent populations; some that haveevolved in rivers, and some from lakes. We will examine
how the ﬂow regime experienced during nest building,
and the type of materials available, interact to deter-
mine the design of nests. We will allow males to build
nests under one regime (’still’ or ’ﬂow’) before testing
aspects of its performance (including resistance to high
ﬂow rates, susceptibility to low oxygen levels, and at-
tractiveness to females) under the regime in which it
was built, and under the opposite regime. This will
quantify the costs of building a nest that is unsuited
to prevailing ﬂow conditions. We will then examine
to what extent males are able to adjust nest build-
ing behaviour when environments change, by examining
building behaviour and nest design of individual males
under ﬁrst one, and then the alternate, ﬂow regime. We
will also use molecular genetic approaches to quantify
the expression of genes in the kidney responsible for
the synthesis of Spiggin, a protein ’glue’ used by the
ﬁsh to secure nesting materials, to determine whether
male sticklebacks regulate gene expression in response
to changing ﬂow conditions.
Applicants must have, or be about to obtain, a PhD
in a relevant discipline such as animal behaviour, be-
havioural ecology or evolutionary ecology or related
subject and have a keen interest in phenotypic plas-
ticity. At least a basic knowledge of modern molecular
techniques (such as PCR) is desirable.

Two three-year postdoctoral positions are available,
starting January 2009, for research at the interface of
evolution, ecology, and human health. The main focus
of both projects involves the bacterial cause of Lyme
disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi is car-
ried between vertebrate hosts by the black-legged tick,
Ixodes scapularis. These ticks occasionally bite humans
and, if infected, can transmit the bacteria, resulting in
human Lyme disease. The complex evolutionary his-
tory of B. burgdorferi consists of Ixodes ticks and feral
vertebrates such as mice, shrews, and chipmunks. B.82 EvolDir October 1, 2008
burgdorferi cannot be transmitted from mother to oﬀ-
spring in ticks or vertebrates, thus ﬁtness is equivalent
to the number of new ticks that acquire the pathogen
by feeding on an infected host. Interestingly, each
vertebrate species transmits a diﬀerent subset of the
B. burgdorferi genotypes to feeding ticks. All ﬁfteen
genotypes coexist in as a multiple niche polymorphism
where vertebrate species act as ecological niches - the
genetic diversity of the pathogen is maintained by the
biodiversity of hosts. In addition, the abundance of
each genotype in ticks - equivalent to the human Lyme
disease risk - is directly related to the composition and
relative abundance of host species. The major aim of
one project is to identify the molecular and ecological
mechanisms maintaining the within population geno-
type polymorphism and to determine the consequences
of these mechanisms on the distribution and abundance
of B. burgdorferi. The major aim of the other project is
to apply ecological and evolutionary theory to optimize
a reservoir targeted vaccine aimed at reducing the risk
of human Lyme disease. Both projects integrate multi-
ple scales of biological complexity (i.e. molecular-level,
organism-level, and population-level) potentially using
laboratory, ﬁeld, and computational studies.
The positions require highly motivated, enthusiastic,
and enquiring individuals with strong backgrounds
in evolutionary biology, ecology, statistics, or related
ﬁelds. Molecular and ﬁeld experience are advantageous.
Quantitative skills are essential.
The University of Pennsylvania has a strong group of
evolutionary biologists and ecologists in the biology de-
partment that frequently interact with each other and
with an accomplished group of microbiologists in the
Medical and Veterinary schools.
The positions are available as early as January 2009.
Starting dates are ﬂexible and I will wait for outstand-
ing candidates. Salary is commensurate with experi-
ence based on the NIH guidelines.

Unique Opportunity for Ten Undergraduates 2009 Evo-
lutionary Genetics Field Study Abroad in China
With funding from NSF’s Partnerships for Interna-
tional Research and Education (PIRE) program, we
are oﬀering 10 undergraduates (U.S. citizens or per-
manent residents only) the opportunity to participate
in a unique study abroad opportunity in China during
the summer of 2009 (mid-May through mid-July).
The research focus of our PIRE grant is a forensic bio-
geographic study of species that are native to China and
invasive in the southeastern U.S. as well as a growing
number of species native to the southeastern U.S. and
invasive in China. Each summer, we will run an 8 week
ﬁeld course where we will visit biological communities
throughout China. After the ﬁeld course, students can
elect to continue in short-term research internships in
our partner labs in China.
Students will need to be prepared to take full advantage
of this experience. Each spring semester, students will
enroll at the University of Georgia (UGA) and take 3
courses; two in intensive elementary Mandarin Chinese
and a laboratory course in genetics. No prior experience
with Chinese language is required, although students
should have had at least a course in introductory biol-
ogy and preferably courses in ecology and evolutionary
biology.
The cost to the student of the summer program is min-
imal: the grant covers travel to and within China, lodg-
ing and most meals. The student is responsible for in-
surance, visa costs and personal expenses. Students are
also responsible for the costs of enrolling at the Univer-
sity of Georgia for all required courses (all students are
charged at the in-state tuition rate of ~$200 per credit
hour).
Applications for the 2009 program are available onour website: http://www.genetics.uga.edu/pire . The
deadline for application is fast approaching, although
we can extend it if a highly motivated student con-
tacts us showing interest and needing some additional
time to get together the application materials. We
encourage any interested students to contact us for
more information. Or, see the web site: “ http://-
www.genetics.uga.edu/pire/undergrad.html” or e-mail
us at “pire@uga.edu”

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected88 EvolDir October 1, 2008
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
