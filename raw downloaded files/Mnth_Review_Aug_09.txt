Italy Evolution and Systems
Oct18-23
I contact you once again from the European Science
Foundation regarding a conference we are organising,
on ’Systems Chemistry II: Evolution and Systems’. The
title can be misleading, the main theme of the confer-
ence is actually hidden in the subtitle: evolution and
systems.
The meeting will focus on how the essential principles
of systems and models, as used in systems chemistry,
can inform wider areas of study. It is an opportunity for
natural, life and social scientists to discuss theories of
evolution, development and the origin of life. Speakers
will come from many diﬀerent backgrounds from both
academia and industry.

Laxenburg Austria Evolution of
Cooperation Sep15-18
Dear all,
>From the 15th to the 18th of September 2009 we are
organizing an international conference on the
EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION- MODELS AND
THEORIES (website: http://www.tect.iiasa.ac.at )
Empirical insights and theoretical methods underlying
the evolutionary theory of cooperation are currently un-
dergoing a phase of rapid expansion and partial reori-
entation. The goal of this conference is to showcase
complementary approaches to evolutionary problems
dealing with the social dilemmas surrounding human
cooperation. The main emphasis will be on theory, or
rather theories, but these will not only be compared
from a mathematical viewpoint: throughout the con-
ference, model-based lectures will be complemented by
lectures on salient empirical ﬁndings. In this way, the
conference will provide a platform for comparing and
orchestrating diﬀerent research approaches.
The conference will be held in the conference center
of the former summer palace of the Habsburg fam-
ily in Laxenburg, near Vienna, Austria, home of the
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA). The conference is organized as part of the
EUROCORES Programme on The Evolution of Coop-
eration and Trading (TECT), coordinated by the Euro-
pean Science Foundation (ESF) and funded by a range
of national research agencies. Laxenburg is a beautiful
village 15 km south of Vienna sporting a magniﬁcent
2.8 km2 of royal gardens including the 200 years old
knight’s castle Franzensburg.

Oxford GMOD Community Meeting
Aug6-7
There will be a GMOD Community Meeting, 6-7 Au-
gust, 2009 at the University of Oxford, in Oxford, UK.
GMOD ( http://gmod.org ) is a collection of interoper-
able, open-source software components for managing,
visualizing, annotating, and sharing biological data.
GMOD is also a community of users and developers ad-
dressing common challenges with their biological data.
The popularity of next generation sequencing and other
high-throughput methods has made this GMOD meet-
ing particularly timely.
GMOD meetings are an excellent opportunity to learn
best practices from other researchers, to meet GMOD
users and developers, and to learn and aﬀect what is
coming in the project. As with previous meetings, there
will be a mixture of project talks, component-focused
talks, and user talks.
Registration for the meeting is now open and space is
available on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served basis. Attendance
is limited to the ﬁrst 55 people to register. The meeting
cost is £50.
See http://gmod.org/wiki/-
August 2009 GMOD Meeting for more information.
Please join us in Oxford this August.

Dear Evolutionary Biologists:
This is a new invitation to enjoy the endless pleasures
of our discipline, once the gathering in Punta del Este
from 26 ^th to 31 ^st July 2010 is conﬁrmed. We proudly
claim that the 9 ^th International Congress of Verte-
brate Morphology will have a really low registration
fee. As a matter of fact, one of the lowest if compared
with similarly sized and reputable events, past andpre-
sent: only USD 300 for regular members and USD 150
for students.
A bargain, isn’t it? However, if you decided to register
prior to October 1st, then it’ll amount next to nothing.
Well, almost: USD 220 for regular attendees and USD
100 for students.
And cheap won’t mean low quality, as we are committed
to turn this event into something unforgettable. How-
ever, for that, we’ll need you to be here. Please register
as soon as possible,using our web page or directly in
that of Jetmar, our dependable travel agency:( http:/-
/www.jetmar.com.uy/icvm2010/ ), and let them help
you about housing and other details.If you have any
diﬃculties, please right to us at once and we’ll do our
best.
The ﬁnal deadline for registration and abstract submis-
sion is February 10th, 2010. After this date,only posters
will be accepted.
Once you have registered (and paid...), you’ll be able
to submit your abstract.
We can give you some hints on the scientiﬁc program,
but there’ll be more to follow in the near future: we’ll
have about 15 symposia and workshops, published in
the website, and 5 ﬁrst class plenary lectures:
Arkhat Abzhanov (Harvard, USA)
Melina Hale (Chicago, USA)
Peter Wainwright (Davis, USA)
Gabriel Marroig (USP, Brazil) and
Eugenia del Pino (PUC, Ecuador).
Please feel free to spread this second circular as much
as you can.

QueenMaryU Darwin in Humanities
https://eshop.qmul.ac.uk/events/-
eventdetails.asp?eventidS Darwin published The
Origin 150 years ago. From that point on he, and
many others, have applied evolutionary theory to
behaviour. And from that point on controversy has
never been far away. Darwin’s own work contributed
to the rise of Comparative Psychology in the late
nineteenth century, which in turn impacted upon
Behaviourism. The 1970s saw the rise of Sociobiology,
and much criticism of attempts to apply evolutionary
biology to human concerns. Initially these criticisms
were grounded in Marxist ideology and set limits
to the remit of biological science: human properties
required a diﬀerent framework. More recently the
humanities and social sciences have taken a similar
view but with a post-modern twist, actively eschewing
scientiﬁc, and especially biological understanding,
and in so doing forsaking prediction. In spite of
this history of ideological criticism, what might be
termed the Human Evolutionary Behavioural Sciences
(HEBS) have diversiﬁed into Evolutionary Psychology,
Human Behavioural Ecology and Cultural Evolution,
and in so doing have ﬂourished. In this meeting we
hope to showcase new and exciting work from within
HEBS, and look at where eﬀorts should be focused in
the future. It is our contention that the humanities
and social sciences cannot ignore the central place of
evolution as a theoretical framework for understanding
human aﬀairs.
This symposium celebrates 200 years of Darwin’s birth
and 150 years since the publication of The Origin. It
also coincides with the launch of a new undergradu-
ate degree in Psychology at the School of Biological &
Chemical Sciences (Queen Mary University of London,
http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/index.html ) which is un-
derpinned by an evolutionary framework. We acknowl-
edge the generous support of the European Human Be-
haviour & Evolution Association (EHBEA), The Gal-
ton Institute and the School of Biological & Chemical
Sciences (QMUL).

The focus for the symposium is a celebration of the bi-
centenary of Darwin’s birth and the fundamental role
that evolutionary science plays in modern biology and
its applications to human health and medicine. The
symposium will reﬂect on the various areas of soci-
etal concerns and needs related to human health and
medicine where evolutionary research has led to new
understandings of long-standing problems. All presen-
tations will be given by specially invited speakers, who

BiKF Germany Biodiversity
The Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-
F) has recently been founded by the Senckenbergische
Naturforschende Gesellschaft, the Goethe-Universit¨ at
Frankfurt am Main, and additional partners. It is
funded by the Hessian State Initiative for the Develop-
ment of Scientiﬁc and Economic Excellence (LOEWE).
The mission of the Centre is to carry out internationally
outstanding research on the interactions of biodiversity
and climate change at the organism level. The Project
Area C “Adaptation and Climate” invites applications
for the position of a
Ph.D. position “Planktonbank” PG C 5.5 [Ref. #C 30]
BAT II a/2
One of the main focus of the research programme
“Adaptation and Climate” is to study adaptation of
aquatic organisms to climate changes. Resting stages
of freshwater plankton represent a valuable source for
monitoring evolutionary change over time. In order
to unravel the evolutionary potential and response to
recent climatic changes, we will explore lake sediment
cores to identify ecologically relevant traits underlying
climatic stress tolerance.
The main objectives of the project are (1) to expose
Daphnia clones to diﬀerent temperature regimes us-
ing life history experiments (2) to determine genetic
responses underlying phenotypic evolution in response
to global change. Resting eggs of plankton species from
lake sediment cores will be studied to assess the evolu-
tionary potential of current and extinct populations.
The applicant should hold an earned master’s degree or
diploma in biology and is expected to have expertise in
the following areas: application of molecular markers
for population genetics and ecology; life history exper-
iments; aquatic ecology. The successful candidate will
cooperate with various groups of biologists working on
the long term impact of climate change on natural pop-ulations. Very good written and oral English language
skills and interest in joining a multidisciplinary research
team are required.
The Research Centre BiK-F advocates gender equal-
ity. Women are therefore strongly encouraged to apply.
Equally qualiﬁed severely handicapped applicants will
be given preference. The contract will start September
1st, 2009, and will be restricted until December 31st,
2010. An extension for another two years is possible,
but depending on funding. The duty station will be at
the Biologie-Campus, Siesmayerstraße 70-72, Frankfurt
am Main, Germany. Oﬃcial employer is Senckenbergis-
che Naturforschende Gesellschaft.
Please send your application by mail or preferably
e-mail, including a detailed CV and 2 references as soon
as possible to Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. V. Mosbrugger, Sci-
entiﬁc Coordinator Biodiversity and Climate Research

Eawag is the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science
and Technology, a Swiss-based and internationally op-
erating aquatic research institute within the ETH do-
main.
The Department Aquatic Ecology (group of Piet
Spaak) seeks a
PhD student in Evolutionary Biology
The PhD student will participate in a collaborative re-
search project with Juliane Hollender (EnvironmentalAugust 1, 2009 EvolDir 13
Chemistry, Eawag) and Flavio Anselmetti (Sedimen-
tology, Eawag) to study the invasion of Daphnia during
the past 100 years in lakes north and south of the Swiss
Alps, using genetic information from diapausing eggs
buried in lake sediments. Furthermore, by hatching
Daphnia from past layers we want to study experimen-
tally the role of contaminants on the success of Daphnia
taxa (resurrection ecology). This study aims to blend
the excellent research facilities both in environmental
chemistry and evolutionary biology at Eawag. Another
PhD student in the project studies the fate of pollutants
over time in sediment cores of the same lakes. The focus
of this project will be on evolutionary aspects.
For this project, ﬁnanced by the Swiss Science founda-
tion, we are looking for a highly motivated candidate
with interests in evolutionary biology, population ge-
netics and environmental disturbance. Although ﬁeld
work is also involved, most of the work will be done
in the lab (conducting experiments and screening dia-
pausing eggs using molecular tools). Some of the work
on lakes south of the Alps might be done in Italy.
We oﬀer a stimulating research environment in a lively
and social institute in D¨ ubendorf (near Z¨ urich) in a
department with several other evolutionary and eco-
logical research groups. The position will be for a pe-
riod of three years, and should start as soon as possible
(September 2009 or soon thereafter). The ideal candi-
date has both experimental as well as molecular skills
(PCR, genotyping). A Diploma or Masters degree (or
equivalent) in biology or related subject is necessary
for admission. The working language in the group is
English.
Applications should include a letter of interest with a
description of pertinent experience, curriculum vitae,
a list of publications (if any), the names (with e-mail
addresses) of two potential referees, and copies of cer-
tiﬁcates of academic qualiﬁcations.
Please submit your application by 7 August 2009 as
one single PDF ﬁle to Sandra Isenring, Eawag, Human
Resources Department: recruiting@eawag.ch, indicat-
ing reference number 094402. For further information,

The chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
(Bd) has emerged as a major threat to amphibian sur-
vival across the world. Recently, the fungus has been
found o be infecting amphibians in the UK. A PhD
studentship is oﬀered to investigate the epidemiology
of Bd in the UK, including the extent of Bd infection
and the role of anthropogenic factors in its emergence.
The results of these studies will be synthesised to in-
form possible Bd control policies in the UK.
The successful applicant will join a team of researchers
investigating Bd emergence in the UK and its impact
on native species. The studentship will involve the de-
velopment of spatial models to explain Bd infection dy-
namics, informing these with results from ﬁeld sam-
pling (swabbing amphibians, environmental sampling)
and laboratory analyses (real-time PCR). Possible ad-
ditional components of this research include Bd culture
and genotyping and experimental infection work to de-
termine the susceptibility of diﬀerent amphibian species
to diﬀerent strains of Bd.
This challenging studentship is funded by Defra with
an annual stipend of ˆA£18,000 for three years and will
be based at the Institute of Zoology, London, UK.
Start date: 1st October 2009.

Title Comparative genomics of sex determination in ﬁsh
Project description Scientiﬁc background In mammals
and birds, sexual development is controlled by rather
stable sex determination systems having emerged at
least 100 million years ago (XY male and ZW female
heterogamety, respectively). In strong contrast, fre-
quent evolutionary changes place sexual development
under the control of new sex determination systems
in ﬁsh (for review, Volﬀ et al. 2007, Sexual Develop-
ment 1: 85-99). Hence, even two populations belong-
ing to a same species can have diﬀerent mechanisms
of sex determination. Such frequent changes might
be involved in pre-/post-zygotic isolation and there-
fore in speciation. A better understanding of the con-
trol of sexual development in ﬁsh is essential for aqua-
culture, which generally uses monosex population to
avoid stress linked to reproduction and exploit some
sex-linked traits of zootechnical interest. Hence, ﬁsh
aquaculture is interested in methods allowing molecu-
lar sexing of individuals at early stages of their devel-
opment as well as phenotypical sex inversion through
environment-friendly processes. In order to better un-
derstand the molecular and evolutionary basis of the
variability of sex determination in ﬁsh and its impact
on biodiversity and speciation, it appears necessary to
identify the genes controlling sexual dimorphism in dif-
ferent species and to compare the regulatory cascades
under their control. Therefore, we have initiated two
projects aiming the positional cloning of sex determi-
nation genes in two ﬁsh species, le platyﬁsh Xiphopho-
rus maculatus and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
mykiss. These species, which diverged at least 200
million years ago, have both a genetic sex determi-
nation system (XYW in the platyﬁsh and XY in the
trout). In the platyﬁsh, we have already assembled
megabase-sized “contigs” of bacterial artiﬁcial chromo-
some (BAC) clones including the region diﬀerentiating
the X from the Y chromosome. These contigs are cur-
rently being sequenced and analyzed in collaboration
with the sequencing center Genoscope. This project is
funded by the French Research Agency (ANR Blanche
seXYphophorus, 2008-2010, coordinator JN Volﬀ). In
rainbow trout, we aim in collaboration with INRA insti-
tutes from Rennes and Jouy-en-Josas to identify a sec-
ondary sex-determining gene responsible for the occur-
rence of males in XX populations. This second project
is based on the analysis of candidate genes and BAC
contigs containing molecular markers linked to the lo-
cus of interest (ANR G´ enomique Sexytrout, 2008-2011,
coordinator INRA Rennes). Whole genome sequenc-
ing projects will contribute important sequence data
for both species.
Scientiﬁc questions This project of comparative func-tional genomics aims, using sexual development in ﬁsh
as an example, to better understand the evolution-
ary dynamics of the regulation of biological processes.
Based on data generated by the seXYphophorus and
Sexytrout projects, the candidate will have to answer
the following scientiﬁc questions: - What are the genes
controlling sexual dimorphism in diﬀerent ﬁsh species?
- What is the genomic location of these genes with re-
spect to sex chromosomes and other regions controlling
sexual development in diﬀerent ﬁsh species? - What are
the functional similarities and diﬀerences between these
genes in diﬀerent species, particularly in the hierarchy
of the sex determination cascade?
Research program and methods used The candidate will
be involved in the genetic, evolutionary and functional
analysis of gene candidates for sex determination iden-
tiﬁed in the projects seXYphophorus (sequencing of the
sex-determining region in platyﬁsh) and Sexytrout (se-

UBasel BacterialEvolution
TWO PHD POSITIONS IN BACTERIAL EVOLU-
TIONARY GENOMICS at the Biozentrum, University
of Basel, Switzerland
Two PhD positions in bacterial evolutionary genomics
are available in the group of Prof. E. van Nimwegen
at the Biozentrum of the University of Basel, also a
member of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The
overarching research interests of our lab concern the
evolution of entire genomes and the structure, func-
tioning, and evolution of genome-wide molecular inter-
action networks that regulate cellular behavior, includ-
ing transcription regulatory networks and signaling net-
works.
Our group is highly interdisciplinary with members
whose backgrounds range from molecular biology,
chemistry, biophysics, to theoretical physics. Although
the main focus of the group is on theoretical analy-
sis and modeling, we are currently adding a wet-lab
component to study bacterial evolutionary genomics,
and have two open positions in experimental evolution-
ary genomics. Both positions will be co-supervised by
Prof. E. van Nimwegen and Dr. O. Silander, who will
be heading the wet lab.
The main aim of the ﬁrst research project is to un-
cover the selection forces that shape changes in gene-
content and phenotypic abilities of bacteria on rela-
tively short evolutionary time scales, and to charac-
terize these selection forces quantitatively. We will use
high- throughput phenotypic characterization of related
bacterial strains, in combination with sequencing of the
entire genomes of selected strains using next generation
deep sequencing technology. An integral part of the
project will be the theoretical analysis of the obtained
data, and relating the results to recent theories that
have been developed in our group based on the analysis
large-scale analysis of genomics data (e.g. van Nimwe-
gen, Trends in Genet 19:9:479-484 (2003), Molina and
van Nimwegen, Biol Direct 3:51 (2008)). In particular,
we are interested in characterizing the environmental
and evolutionary forces that drive changes in genomeAugust 1, 2009 EvolDir 19
complexity.
The main aim of the second project is to understand de
novo evolution of transcriptional regulation and pro-
moter architecture. We will use experimental evolu-
tion of bacteria to evolve novel promoter sequences.
This will be followed by detailed sequence analysis of
the evolved promoters using next generation sequenc-
ing technologies. A central part of this project will
involve characterization of transcription factor binding
motifs (e.g. van Nimwegen, E. BMC Bioinf 8(Suppl
6):S4 (2007)) and computational modeling to predict
how transcription factor binding aﬀects expression.
Requirements for the position are a master diploma
in biology or biochemistry and a strong background
in molecular biology. Knowledge and/or experience
in microbiology, bioinformatics, applied mathematics,
and programming would all be highly advantageous.
The candidates should have good knowledge of English,
German is helpful but not necessary. The salary is ac-
cording to the guidelines of the Swiss National Science
Foundation and the entrance date will by mutual ar-
rangement.

UEdinburgh H1N1evolution
Please note: this studentship is open to UK residents
only.
PhD Studentship: The molecular evolution and
epidemiology of 2009 swine-origin human inﬂuenza
A/H1N1.
Background The current pandemic of H1N1 inﬂuenza
of swine origin demonstrates the diﬃculty in predicting
the risk of the human population to emerging infectious
diseases. It’s sustained human-to-human transmission
has caused the WHO to declare this virus as the ﬁrst
world-wide pandemic of the 21st Century. Although the
virus appears to cause mild to moderate symptoms in
most cases at the moment, there are concerns about the
emergence of drug resistance and a second wave as the
UK goes into the Autumn ﬂu season. The current situ-
ation oﬀers an excellent opportunity for a talented stu-
dent with a quantitative background to help understand
the spread and evolution of the H1N1 Swine-Origin In-
ﬂuenza Virus (S-OIV), since the scientiﬁc community is
collecting large amounts of simultaneous epidemiologi-
cal and genetic data.
This project will apply state-of-the-art methods of
molecular epidemiology to synthesize viral genetic and
epidemiological information to characterize the emerg-
ing inﬂuenza epidemic as it happens. The project will
have the UK as its focus but inﬂuenza is a global disease
so the evolutionary dynamics will be put into a global
context using the wealth of available virus genetic data.
The project will be informed by the now extensive data
available on S-OIV ’swine’ ﬂu from Spring 2009 and also
by new data as it emerges from the future UK inﬂuenza
seasons. In particular, the interaction between the new
A/H1N1 S-OIV strain and our two existing seasonal ﬂu
strains (human A/H1N1 & A/H3N2) will be examined.
Previous pandemics (in 1957 and 1968) have resulted
in the extinction of the originally circulating strain al-
though the re-emergence of A/H1N1 in 1977 has re-
sulted in 2 co-circulating lineages. The emergence of
S-OIV gives us a unique opportunity to examine the
pandemic phenomenon using genetic and epidemiolog-
ical approaches.
Person Speciﬁcation We are looking for an exceptional
and enthusiastic PhD candidate to work in Infectious
Disease Evolution and Epidemiology. You may have a
degree/MSc in mathematics with an interest in genet-ics/evolution and epidemiology; in biology / medicine
with strong training in quantitative methods; or in
physics / informatics (or similar) with an interest in
biology and the aptitude to apply your skills to an im-
portant problem. As the time-scale is short, prior expe-
rience in Phylogenetic packages would be an advantage
but strong programming and/ or statistical/numerical
skills will be essential. The studentship will be held
jointly between two highly regarded research groups
(Viral Molecular Evolution and Infectious Disease Epi-
demiology) and may have opportunities to spend time
working with Government partners and with other col-
laborating institutions.
Information about the work being done in the
two groups may be found on these websites:

ULeuven InsectSpermCompetition
PhD student position: University of Leuven, Labora-

the economy of sperm use in insect societies
We are looking for a highly motivated PhD student to
join the Laboratory of Entomology at the University of
Leuven, Belgium ( http://www.kuleuven.be/bio/ento )
to work on a project on sperm competition and the
economy of sperm use in insect societies. Insect so-
cieties such as ants, bees and wasps are remarkable in
that queens store the sperm of the males they mate with
in a sperm storage organ (the spermatheca), in which
they keep the sperm alive for their entire lives, some-
times for up to 20 years. This puts an exceptionally
strong selection pressure on queens to make economic
use of this sperm. The main aims of the project are
to determine whether multiple mating in some species
might lead to increased sperm competition and a re-
duced economy of sperm use, and whether there is an-22 EvolDir August 1, 2009
tagonistic coevolution between the queen and the stored
sperm over the fertilisation rate of eggs.
The project will be carried out under the joint super-
vision of Dr. Tom Wenseleers and Prof. Johan Billen.
Candidates should have an interest in evolutionary bi-
ology and functional morphology. Prior research expe-
rience in working with social insects would be a bonus,
but is not strictly required. Funding for both salary and
consumables for 3 years is available through a grant
from the Fund for Scientiﬁc Research Flanders. The

UNeuchatel SocialEvolutionTheory
Dear colleagues,
Two PhD positions are open under the supervi-
sion of Dr. Laurent Lehmann to study social evo-
lution theory at the Laboratory of eco- ethology
of the University of Neuchatel Switzerland ( http://-
www2.unine.ch/ethol/). The positions are funded by
the Swiss National Science Foundation and are available
for three years. Starting date: end of 2009, beginning
of 2010. Salary per annum: 36900 to 45600 CHF.
The focus of the SNF-funded project is to develop gene-
culture co- evolutionary models for social interactions,
with focus on human evolution. The project will have
two diﬀerent but complementary directions. First, we
will seek to develop models, which can explain the evo-
lution of the transition of small-scale egalitarian soci-
eties to larger-scale stratiﬁed societies. Second, we will
seek to develop models aiming at understanding the
role of individual and social learning in the expression
and dynamics of social behaviours, for example in the
context of the usage of adaptive and maladaptive cul-
tural traits. Some related papers on this can be found
athttp:// www.stanford.edu/ ˜ lehmann/ . Depending
upon the applicants, the work could be taken in a num-
ber of directions.
The Institute of Biology at Neuchatel consists of a
dozen groups working in diverse ﬁelds of ecology,
evolution, physiology and molecular and cell biology.
Neuchatel is a University town in the French-speaking
part of Switzerland situated between the Jura Moun-
tains and a 40km long lake. The town is well connected
with larger centers such as Lausanne, Geneva, Berne, or
Zurich by public transportation. For more information,
contact Laurent Lehmann (lehmann@stanford.edu).
Applicants must have a university degree that allows
entrance to a PhD program. Applicants are required to
have good knowledge in mathematics or computer pro-
gramming. Ideal applicants have a good knowledge of
evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and/or pop-
ulation genetics. A strong interest in understandingthe genetic and cultural factors driving social evolution
in humans is an asset. Motivated applicants should
submit (1) a one-page letter that summarizes interests
and relevant experience, (2) a CV, (3) copies of un-
dergraduate and masters/diploma transcripts, and (4)
contact information for 2 references (all as PDFs) to
lehmann@stanford.edu.
Best wishes, Laurent Lehmann

UOtago EvolutionaryBiol
A PhD studentship in evolutionary ecology and con-
servation at University of Otago, New Zealand. This
project uniquely integrates diﬀerent disciplines - evolu-
tionary biology, conservation biology, behavioural ecol-
ogy, genetics and endocrinology - to tackle a multitude
of questions. The main aim of this project is to test the
assumptions of “Trojan sex chromosome theory” using
life bearing Poeciliid ﬁsh. Trojan sex chromosome the-
ory utilizes hormonal reversal of sex and skewing sex-
ratio to control animal population size. In this project,
we will investigate the ﬁtness of sex-reversed individ-
uals and their oﬀspring (trans- generational eﬀects).
We will also conduct behavioural experiments for mate
choice and intra- and inter-speciﬁc aggression in these
individuals. Furthermore, we will use computer sim-
ulations (individual- based modeling) to integrate all
observed parameters to predict outcomes of the appli-
cation of this theory in the real world. The student will
be encouraged to explore their own ideas. The scholar-
ship consists of: a stipend NZD 25,000 every year for
3 years and tuition fee waivers over 3 years. This PhD
position (3 years) is open to students, who have com-
pleted or are completing their BSc(Hons) or/and MSc
(or equivalent), of any citizenships (need to fulﬁll Uni-
versity English Requirements). The preferred date of
start for this PhD is September 1st (or slightly later).
The successful applicant will be supervised by Dr Mark
Lokman, Dr Gerry Closs, and myself (Shinichi Naka-
gawa). Please check our departmental webpage ( http:/-
/www.otago.ac.nz/zoology ). Our department oﬀers an
excellent working environment for PhD students. Also
s/he will live in the wonderful city of Dunedin, which
is surrounded by beautiful sceneries. We are seeking
a highly motivated student with a proven academic
record for this very challenging PhD. If you are inter-
ested or want to know more about this PhD, please24 EvolDir August 1, 2009

ampliﬁed breast tumors). In the near future, INCa is
considering contributing more tumor types. The en-
tire sequencing of multiple pairs of tumor and matched
germline DNAs has already been completed in France
and other pairs are rapidly following. In order to over-
come the challenges raised by the massive amount of
sequence data that has been and will be generated
by such programs, INCa and the Lyon community

Evolution of aging
The newly established Independent Research Group
Modeling the Evolution of Aging at the MPIDR in Ros-
tock, Germany, is seeking to make appointments at the
PhD, Post-Doc, and Research Scientist levels. Starting
date as soon as feasible but preferably not later than
01.04.2010
The patterns of life are stunningly diverse, and so are
the patterns of aging. Our group on “Modeling the
Evolution of Aging” aims to discover the unifying prin-
ciples and patterns underlying this diversity. We will
ask why evolution favored a certain path of aging in
a certain species. In particular, we will ask why some
species age fast while others age slowly or even seem
to escape aging all together. Can we understand aging
across animals, plants, fungi and bacteria to a degree
that allows us to identify the factors responsible for
whether aging is fast, slow, or even reversed? We will
develop generic models that capture aging for certain
groups of species such as mammals, reptiles, or trees.
Our plan will be the following: 1. Conceptualize/deﬁne34 EvolDir August 1, 2009
“aging” as well as “fast aging”, “slow aging”, “no-
aging” in a comparative framework across animals,
plants, fungi and bacteria. 2. Discover what species
follow what aging patterns. To get a broad view on
patterns across species, we will rely on good life table
data and textbook knowledge on the phylogeny, physi-
ology and ecology of the various species. To get an in-
depth view we will collaborate with experts around the
world who can provide us with empirical evidence and
expert knowledge on particular species. 3. Running our
creative minds, juggling available data and knowledge
on the various species thinking outside of conventional
boxes we then identify key variables that seem to give
us a reasonable species grouping. 4. Based on these
key variables, we will develop generic models for these
groups. If a model becomes too clumsy with all the key
variables included, we will develop several simple mod-
els to shed light on diﬀerent aspects of aging in a single
group. 5. What is the evolutionary successful strat-
egy of aging in the various models? Can we develop a
general algorithm that solves the various models?
Our team will consist of people with a burning interest
in theoretical modeling, a strong preference for reveal-
ing and understanding general mechanisms and unify-
ing principles, and a strong interest in studying popu-
lation dynamics in an interdisciplinary group. Our col-
lective expertise should ideally cover skills and knowl-
edge in theoretical modeling, evolutionary biology, life
history biology, comparative biology (with a main fo-
cus on basic physiological, phylogenetic and ecologi-
cal characteristics across the tree of life), demography,
ecology, mathematics, dynamic optimization, program-
ming, statistics, non-linear dynamics, complex adaptive
systems and principles of self-organization. Our project
is likely to cut across all the life sciences.
The group will be established by Dr. Annette Baud-
isch. The group will be part of the MPIDR in Rostock,
a bike-ride away from the Baltic Sea. The institute is
very international, with a warm and colleagial working
atmosphere hosting a diverse range of labs with inter-
disciplinary topics. The working language of all groups
including ours is English.
Applications should include a CV with relevant experi-
ence, educational degrees, a list of any publications and
the contact details of 3 references. A description of your
research interest and why you would enjoy becoming a
member of our team would be very helpful. All material
should be e-mailed to: appl-irgmea@demogr.mpg.de,
preferably in a single pdf ﬁle. Applications will be con-
sidered and positions will be ﬁlled on a rolling basis.
PhD and Post-Doc appointments are made on doctoral
and postdoctoral stipends, respectively. Research sci-entists will be employed up to salary level 14 on the
basis of the German TV¨ oD system according to the
qualiﬁcation of the candidate and in accordance with
the rules of federal employees in Germany.
The Max Planck Society wishes to increase the share of
women in areas where they are underrepresented, and
strongly encourages women to apply. The Max Planck
Society is committed to employing more handicapped
individuals and especially encourages them to apply.

10K Trees Website
The 10kTrees Website: A New Online Resource for Pri-
mate Phylogeny
We are pleased to announce The 10kTrees Project,
which is available at http://10ktrees.fas.harvard.edu/
.
The goal of the 10kTrees Project is to infer a set of phy-
logenetic trees from available data in GenBank that is
appropriate for comparative research on primates. The
website provides a Bayesian inference of primate phy-
logeny for 189 primate species based on 5 genes. At the
site, users can download a consensus tree, or they can
download up to at 10,000 trees drawn from the Markov
chain sample. Comparative analyses can then be con-
ducted across the tree block to control for phylogenetic
uncertainty.
The website provides a way for users to prune the trees
to the species of interest. We also provide the full
genetic data set and details on the analysis. In the
documentation, we give advice for importing the trees
into diﬀerent comparative analysis programs, such as
BayesTraits, R, and Mesquite.
The 10kTrees Project is a work in progress and we envi-
sion regular updates to the data set, trees and website.
For example, we are already working on Version 2 of
the dataset, which will most likely include over 220 pri-
mate species and 9 genes. We also expect that the web-
site itself will evolve to provide more tools for primate
comparative biology, including a taxonomic translationtool.
We hope you will ﬁnd this website useful, and we wel-
come any feedback.

Arlequin and AFLP
Dear colleagues,
I am attempting to analyse an AFLP dataset using Ar-
lequin. I have the ﬁle currently set up as a STRUC-
TURE ﬁle (which works) but it doesn’t export to Ar-
lequin and many web searches have failed to ﬁnd a pro-
gram to do this or even ﬁnd an example input data ﬁle.
So, if anybody out there would be willing for me to see
an ’example’ Arlequin input ﬁle for AFLP data I would
be very grateful.
With best wishes,46 EvolDir August 1, 2009

Arlequin and AFLP answers
Dear Colleagues,
Some expressed that I share what I found from the help-
ful network. And indeed it was helpful, and I am par-
ticularly thankful to the large proportion of students
who answered my plea.
I went straight to using AFLPdat, this runs in R, but
don’t be afraid the AFLPdat user-manual was very
helpful and it allowed conversions into many of the cur-
rently used population genetic programs...however the
link is no longer correct and after a little help from
Google the following link is where the program can be
found:
http://www.nhm.uio.no/forskning-samlinger/-
forskning/forskningsgrupper/ncb/ 2 other conversion
programs were recommended, but I did not try these.
The easiest way for me was using FAMD ( http://-
www.famd.me.uk/famd.html ) which uses a very simple
input ﬁle and gives you Structure and Arlequin outputs.
a very convenient data converter you might want
to give a try. http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/-
PGDSpider/ HOWEVER, one of the biggest hurdles is
getting the data (once scored in GeneMapper, or Gen-
eMarker) into EXCEL and back out again in a useful
format (ie format for AFLPdat). If anyone knows a way
of extending the number of Columns in EXCEL to more
than 256 this would help tremendously, as my datasets
were 1440 and 1808...which means 4 blocks of data (not
very useful) or having individuals as columns (if that is
under 256!)...what I had to do is use the macros in EX-
CEL to save a text ﬁle, this was a very useful functionbut I have a ’macro-expert’ here.
Anyway, thanks again and hope this is useful to some-
one.
Best wishes,
Mark.

Book store closing
Dear Colleagues,
I urge you to please help support the following inde-
pendent bookstore that is struggling to survive. ThisAugust 1, 2009 EvolDir 47
bookstore has several branches around the US and sup-
ports many important events centered around getting
people to think critically about scientiﬁc, social, and
ethical issues. The bookstore sponsors such events as
“Recent developments in cell biology: functioning in a
noisy world” (July 19) and panel discussions on evolu-
tionary biology, “intelligent design”, as well as discus-
sions and lectures on current social issues.
This precious resource will soon go the way of other
independent bookstores (i.e. toward extinction) if we
don’t support it this month. Please think seriously
about a sustaining membership or at least a one-time
contribution.
There are very few resources like this where rational
people can get together with the public and discuss how
critical thinking can be used practically in society and
education. As scientists who depend on public support,
it is imperative that we be active participants in such
ventures.

Czech basic research
Dear All,
Our Czech colleagues are facing a government deter-
mined to drastically cut funding for basic research, in
favour of applied research and industry.
As highlighted in a recent issue of Nature, the Academy
of Sciences of the Czech Republic and Czech academic
research as a whole is endangered by planned severe
cuts in funding, reaching up to 50% in 2012.
<http://podpisova-akce.avcr.cz/en/index.php >If
you have beneﬁted from the resurgence of Czech sci-ence in the international literature, or you simply feel
that this issue is one that concerns us all, please take a
moment to ﬁnd out more and perhaps add your signa-
ture to a petition in support of our colleagues:

DNA recleaning answers
Dear All, I’d like to thank everyone who responded to
my query. I haven’t had the chance to try all of the
suggestions, but I have had some success (all posted
below).
I’ve tried the following without success (in addition to
the list on the original post): - DMSO - BSA - Gene
Releaser - DNA Ligase (not conclusive yet) (in combi-
nation or isolated, diﬀerent volumes, etc.)
The only thing that seemed to work for some samples
was incubation in Proteinase K for 2 hours at 60o¯C.
There seems to be also an additional quality problem
that was not evident in the beginning. After denatur-
ing the re-digested samples at 95o¯C for 5 minutes I ran
them on an agarose gel again and they looked smeary
(degraded). It became obvious the double stranded
DNA had nicks. I incubated a bunch of samples in dif-
ferent conditions to test for endonucleases and that did
not seem to be the case. The best explanation I have
so far would be degradation by some physical agent.
These DNA samples were shipped by FedEx and might
have been X-rayed.
Has anyone had any problems with X-rayed DNA sam-
ples before? Is there a better and safer way to ship
DNA samples?
Thanks, Hugo
This was the original post: I am having trouble get-
ting PCR ampliﬁcations from some of my samples. I
have not access to more tissue sample, so I have tried
re-cleaning the genomic DNA in solution using diﬀer-
ent methods with *very* little success, usually los-
ing much of the DNA in the process. I’ve tried: -
Phenol-chlorophorm-isoamyl + chlorophorm-isoamyl +
ethanol precipitation; - Heating them in NaOH+SDS
for 20 minutes (following Shi et al. 2004) followed
by Phenol-chlorophorm-isoamyl + ethanol precipita-
tion; - Promega Wizard Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation kit;48 EvolDir August 1, 2009
- Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit; - Qiagen DNeasy Plant
kit. I have plenty, long non-degraded DNA in solution
(checked on Nanodrop and on agarose gel). I’ve also
tried diluting the samples with no success. When co-
amplifying these samples with ones that work, I still get
ampliﬁcations (that sequence well) which means what-
ever it is, it’s not something in solution but most likely
bound/cross-linked to the DNA. I must add that these
samples were originally extracted from ﬁsh muscle tis-
sue preserved in ethanol or frozen, using an ammonium
acetate protocol and isopropanol precipitation. I’d be
grateful if you could suggest some alternative method
that has worked for you, including modiﬁcations of the
above (as they are typically meant for extraction from
tissue and not from aqueous solution).
A compilation of mostly unique answers:
I’m not sure what taxa you’re looking at but have you
tried CTAB in the initial step. We use it with mollus-
can tissues and it seems to take out the PCR inhibitors.
>>>>>>
probably you have some proteins in your DNA extrac-
tion that inhibit PCR ampliﬁcation. You could try to
add some small amount of Proteinase K to your so-
lution. This breaks up these proteins. We use Qiagen
Proteinase K of 10-20 µl (at the moment i have my Lab-
book not here, so i cant tell you the concentration, but
i could look up). Then use 50-60C for about 30min till
3h and then retry the ampliﬁcation. An other point
is to add more Taq-Polymerase or use a better Poly-
merase, like Phusion (sometimes you have to raise the
concentration of MgCl2 in your PCR cocktail then).
Normally this will help.
Good luck,
>>>>>>
Is there a diﬀerence in molecular weight/quality of the
DNA that works versus the DNA that does not am-
plify? Depending on the size you are attempting to am-
plify, something else you could try, unrelated to DNA
puriﬁcation, is cutting your DNA with a restriction en-
zyme. I’ve had limited success doing that when I have
problems amplifying extremely high MW DNA sam-
ples. You might also try an extra long denature on
your PCR cycles to see if that works.
>>>>>>
you might try treating the extracted DNA (from any
of the methods listed) with (v/v) 1:1, 1:2 or 1:3 10%
Chelex resin (BioRad). Basically, for 1:2, you mix 1
part DNA with 2 parts 10% chelex, heat to 100 C for
10 minutes, spin down and use the supernatant in your
PCR reaction. You can scale this up to 96-well (orgreater) by ﬁltering the DNA+Chelex through a milli-
pore plate to remove the chelex from solution (it can
inhibit PCR). this works well for us with problematic
templates (DNA extracted from blood, tissues, feath-
ers, etc.). In fact, we treat all of our samples this way,
since it is inexpensive. you might also give the DNA
Clean and Concentrator (Zymo) kits a shot, but that
is probably not going to have a terribly diﬀerent ef-
fect from running another Ethanol precip., although
you may not lose quite as much DNA.
>>>>>> How much have you tinkered with the PCR
reaction? You’ve probably tried this, but are you using
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in your PCR reactions?
It non-speciﬁcally binds to just about everything except
DNA and if you’re not

Foundations of Evolutionary BiologyAugust 1, 2009 EvolDir 49
Dear colleagues,
In my courses I’ve often used the series by University
Of Chicago Press on classic papers in diﬀerent areas
(“Foundations of Ecology”, “Foundation of Biogeogra-
phy” and “Foundations of Animal Behavior”). I always
wondered why don’t we have a similar series on Evo-
lutionary Biology, given that I think it’d be a great
teaching tool.
So I decided to contact you and ask for what you think
would be the most inﬂuential papers in the ﬁeld of Evo-
lutionary Biology. I’ll compile the list, rank the papers
and provide the list back to Evoldir.
Looking forward to your contribution,

Graph to Newick
Dear EvolDir members, I am curious if anyone has de-
veloped software or knows of any that exists that can
convert a graphical representation of a phylogenetic tree
(e.g., .pdf/.ai/.ps ﬁle created from a phylogeny in a
published manuscript) to a text format (e.g., newick or
phylip). I know there are lots of programs to go the
other way (e.g., from newick format to a graphical rep-
resentation), which is why I am thinking that it might
be possible to convert a tree back to a text format.
From discussions with those in my local academic com-
munity, there is interest in whether such a conversion
is possible. I will also compile and post any comments
I receive.
Any information or suggestions would be greatly appre-
ciated and thanks for your time, James

(e.g., .pdf/.ai/.ps ﬁle created from a phylogeny in a
published manuscript) to a text format (e.g., newick or
phylip). I know there are lots of programs to go the
other way (e.g., from newick format to a graphical rep-
resentation), which is why I am thinking that it might
be possible to convert a tree back to a text format.
From discussions with those in my local academic com-
munity, there is interest in whether such a conversion
is possible. I will also compile and post any comments
I receive.
Any information or suggestions would be greatly appre-

Mixture models
Dear all,
Do any of you know of a software that implements phy-
logenetic mixture models for mixed topologies (or at
least mixed branch length sets)? I couldn’t ﬁnd that
in BayesPhylogenies or PhyloBayes, but perhaps I’m
missing something...
thanks,

Number of Ecoli LargeGenomes
Dear all
Would any one know:
1)How many E. coli or yeast cells in a colony (a white
dot that develops on agar)? The method of measure-
ment and a reference would be highly appreciated.

2)The largest sequenced bacterial genome is 13.7 Mbp
of soil bacterium Sorangium cellulosum.
Would anyone happen to know of a larger sequenced
or unsequenced bacterial genome, i.e. Is there a larger
bacterial genome measured or estimated by methods
other than sequencing (electrophoresis, etc.)?

Parsing sequences by distance
Dear EvolDir members,
I have a large ( >500 individuals) partial COI DNA se-
quence alignment which I would like to break up into
subsets based on a pairwise sequence distance thresh-
old. For example: break up the alignment into subsets
containing individuals with <10% pairwise sequence
distance. Ideally, I would want to do this without hav-
ing to produce a distance tree.Does anyone know of a program or script that could do
this for me?
Any suggestions are most welcome.
Thanks!

Polymerase for SmartRace
Dear all,
For 5’RACE and 3’RACE I am using the SMART
RACE cDNA ampliﬁcation kit from Clontech. How-
ever, the kit does not contain the DNA polymerase re-
quired for the last step, PCR on cDNA. For this re-
action Clontech recommends their Advantage 2 poly-
merase, which is quite expensive (300 euros for 100 re-
actions or 180 euros for 30 reactions), especially when
one already has Promega and Roche DNA polymerases
in the lab. A Clontech technical representative told
me that most commercially available DNA polymerases
will not amplify the cDNA, only a few of them work.
But of course she couldn’t tell me which ones...
Has anybody tried any other DNA polymerase with this
SMART RACE kit?
Thank you for your answers,

Question about LD analysis
Dear colleaguesAugust 1, 2009 EvolDir 51
I am researcher at the Universitat de Barcelona, work-
ing with chromossomal inversion polymorphisms in
Drosophila subobscura. I have been using the MIDAS
software, analysing Linkage Desiquilibrium (LD) pat-
terns between microsatellites and chromossomal inver-
sions - through the D’ parameter.
However, I was unable to obtain information of LD
patterns between three loci (with corresponding D’ pa-
rameters and signiﬁcance). I have also tried POWER-
MARKER but, as far as I know, this only provides the
p-value of the exact test for the multilocus LD test (and
not the D’ and their signiﬁcance). Anyone knows a soft-
ware package that could perform this analysis (D’ pa-
rameters and their signiﬁcance for multilocus LD anal-
ysis)?

Renaturing Proteins IEF
Dear EvolDirers,
I apologize for the double posting, but the previous one
ended up with a ﬁle extension that made the text un-
readable.
I am trying to adapt immobilized pH gradient (IPG)
strips with a basic narrow range (pH 7-10) to screen
for presence and activity of S-RNases in Solanum. The
problem is that the rehydration and sample preparation
buﬀers that the BioRad Protean cells require cause pro-
tein denaturing, hence forbidding me from running the
RNase activity test. I read somewhere that one can suc-
cessfully renature the proteins in the IPG strips by rins-
ing the strip in a particular buﬀer after the IEF is done
and directly test for RNAse activity in the strip, but I
can’t seem to ﬁnd speciﬁc instructions anywhere. Has
anyone done this renaturing and testing in these kind
of strips? If so, could you share your protocols/recipes?
Any insight will be greatly appreciated
Best,
Jorge

Software Concaterpillar
Dear EvolDir members,
We have just released version 1.4 of Concaterpillar.
Concaterpillar implements a hierarchical likelihood-
ratio test for phylogenetic congruence, as described in
Leigh JW et al 2008, “Testing congruence in phyloge-
nomic analysis” (Syst. Biol. 57:104-15). Concaterpillar
was written in Python and uses RAxML for phyloge-
netic inference of trees from single genes and pairwise-
concatenated genes.
Concaterpillar takes a set of alignments as input and
produces a set of concatenated alignments for which no
signiﬁcant incongruence was identiﬁed, as well as trees
inferred from these sets and a results ﬁle indicating the52 EvolDir August 1, 2009
order in which genes were concatenated. Alignments
need not share all the same taxa but all pairs must share
at least 4 taxa for congruence to be assessed. Concater-
pillar can read a variety of popular alignment formats,
including PHYLIP, FASTA, NEXUS, CLUSTAL, and
many others. This latest version can now read the “re-
laxed” PHYLIP format that is written by Mesquite and
RAxML, in which sequence names are not restricted to
exactly 10 characters, but must be separated from the
sequence by a space (strict PHYLIP formats are still
supported).
Other features added to the current release of Concater-
pillar include support for nucleotide alignments and a
pre-screening step to ensure that all alignment pairs
share enough taxa, as well as various minor bug ﬁxes.
Concaterpillar can be downloaded from http://-

Software FLOCK TRACE
Dear evoldir members,
we wish to introduce the ﬁrst versions of FLOCK AFLP
(1.0), FLOCK MSAT (1.0) and TRACE (1.0), three
programs written in VBA designed to unravel genetic
structure within a collection of genotypes possibly com-
prising a substantial proportion from admixed speci-
mens. In addition, it is assumed that pure, “source”,
samples are not available. The method used to parti-
tion the set of genotypes is iterative reallocation. This
method allows for very short convergence times. One
immediate consequence is that a large number of runs
(e.g. 50) may be performed within a reasonable time
frame. FLOCK searches for reference genetic groups
and thereafter computes admixture levels both on an
individual and a sample basis. Combined with TRACE,
it allows the computation of distance matrices that are
meant to closely reﬂect the structural realtionships be-
tween samples. Each distance matrix may easily be
fed into a tree/cluster plotter to obtain a visual rep-
resentation of those relationships. The inferface of all
three programs are user-friendly and similar to that of
AFLPOP. (Duchesne & Bernatchez 2002). Potentials
users may download free copies of FLOCK AFLP (1.0),FLOCK MSAT (1.0) and TRACE (1.0), directly from

UltrametricTrees
ConstriantTopology
Dear Evoldir members,
I have a known tree topology for which I need to gen-
erate a reasonably correct ultrametric tree using likeli-
hood models. I’m looking for a program which can ei-
ther correctly mathematically scale the branch lengths
in a phylogram into an ultrametric tree or a tree recon-
struction program which meets the following criteria: 1)
Can accept a fully speciﬁed constraint topology to op-
timize 2) Implements both amino acid sequence models
and nucleotide models 3) (optional, but preferable) Willconduct a partitioned analysis with user speciﬁed par-
tition data. A fairly basic molecular clock optimization
is all I need for this analysis, so the ability to specify
multiple fossil calibration points or calculate margins
of error on node divergence times is not necessary.

Visible Implant Elastomer for
reptiles
Dear all,
we are planning to use Visible Implant Elastomer for in-
dividual marking in several reptile species in Madagas-
car (Furcifer, Oplurus, Zonosaurus, Tracheloptychus).
As this method is mainly used in ﬁsheries, we are won-
dering if anyone has experience with using VIE in rep-
tiles? Ideally, we would like to test the usability of the
marking in reptiles before we order the kits, so it would
be great if we can get in contact with someone who is
working with VIE in (northern) Germany?!?

WOMBAT and bivariate analysis
problem
Hi to everyone,
I’m just starting with WOMBAT so my question may
be a litlle bit naive...
I’m trying to code a bivariate model that uses traits
measured in two diﬀerent environments as the distinct
traits. Below you can ﬁnd the listing of my .par ﬁle:
ANAL MUV 2 DATA ./resp.dat TRNOS 1 2 traitno 2
animal 0 sire dam fact1 2 ran3 79 ran1 79 ran2 40 ﬁx1
2 ﬁx2 2 NAMES meas1 meas2
end data
MODEL RAN ran1 1 2 RAN ran2 1 2 RAN ran3 1 2
TR meas1 1 TR meas2 2 END
[and here go covariance matrices]the structure od the DATA section was double checked
with the number and content of all the columns in my
data ﬁle (in this analysis I’m not using sire and dam
infos), however when trying to run the analysis I’m get-
ting the following error message:
Error reading parameter ﬁle : No trait no. found! Cur-
rent line : “TRNOS 1 2”
Currently I have no idea what’s wrong and here goes my
question. Did anybody have problems like this? Can
diﬀerent Linux/Windows coding result in WOMBAT
not being able to read the par/dat ﬁles? My data ﬁle
was saved to ASCII by Excel, but this doesn’t seem to
be a problem since an usual analysis (a univariate one)
runs without any problems and yields proper results.
I’d be greatful for showing what’s wrong or what I’m
missing.

Antwerp InfectiousDiseaseEvolution
Dear colleagues, Our team in Antwerp (Evolutionary
Ecology Group + Centre for Health Economics Re-
search & Modeling Infectious Diseases) is starting a
project entitled “Infectious disease models: wildlife
ecology, ecological disturbance and transmission to hu-
mans.” For this project, two post-doc positions (4
years) and one PhD-fellowship (4 years) are currently
available. Could you please forward this information to
potential candidates? A project summary and links to
the position announcements are given below.
Project summary
Since almost two decades, there is a strong interest
in the ecology and epidemiology of infectious diseases,
especially the so-called re-emerging or new diseases.
Many of those infections are caused by pathogens that
have a natural wildlife reservoir (sometimes still un-
known) or where an arthropod vector is necessary for
the transmission between humans. It is often suggested
that environmental disturbances play a major role in
the spreading of these diseases. In this project we
investigate mechanisms through which this may hap-
pen. The two major pathways that are thought to
contribute to the importance of these diseases are 1)
pathogen jumps between animal and humans leading to
the emergence of a really new infection and 2) chang-
ing environmental conditions that favour the expan-
sion of populations of the natural reservoir species or
that allow faster, more frequent and/or more eﬃcient
transmission between hosts. Changes in the environ-
ment, however, could also have more complex eﬀects if
they for example cause more abundant populations of
hosts but at the same time reduce transmission (e.g.
warmer winters lead to higher rodent numbers, but
some viruses remain infectious for a longer time un-
der cold conditions). For this project, we selected ﬁve
diﬀerent model systems where we anticipate likely envi-
ronmental disturbances (e.g. plausible climate change
scenarios, or vaccinations that create opportunities for
new pathogens) that would lead to combinations of pos-itive or negative eﬀects on transmission and positive or
neutral eﬀects on host populations (the eﬀects of re-
ductions of host populations are already well studied).
Those systems are Puumala hantavirus in bank voles
in Belgium, plague in gerbils in Kazakhstan, Mopeia
arenaviruses in multimammate mice in Tanzania, the
mosquito-transmitted dengue fever in humans (mainly
in Asia), and rotaviruses that cause gastro- enteritis
in humans (mainly in children) in Belgium. The par-
ticipating groups have considerable and internationally
well- reputed experience with these model systems, but
the main reasons for selecting them are that there are
sizeable pre-existing long-term data and that clear hy-
potheses can be formulated about what could happen
under very speciﬁc ecological conditions. The systems
will be studied using a combination of existing observa-
tional data, new prospective ﬁeld data, ﬁeld and labora-
tory experiments and mathematical modelling. Mathe-
matical models are a very powerful tool in understand-
ing the ecology of infection and for the development of
optimal disease control strategies. At the same time,
however, they often remain very theoretical because of
lack of ﬁeld data to parameterise and validate them.
The present proposal will provide data to do exactly
this and will thus allow to test diﬀerent basic epidemi-
ological assumptions. This will provide new insights
in transmission dynamics that were hitherto impossi-
ble to verify, it will allow predictions about what can
be expected under diﬀerent environmental conditions
and it will also contribute directly to new approaches
in disease management.

CornellU SpeciationGenetics
Postdoctoral position in behavioral evolutionary genet-
ics and speciation
P.I.: Dr. Kerry Shaw, Cornell University
Research Project:
A postdoctoral position is available to join an NSF-
funded project in the laboratory of Kerry Shaw to study
the evolution and genetics of traits involved in repro-
ductive incompatibility and speciation in the Hawai-
ian cricket genus Laupala. Laupala species are recently
diverged and ecologically and morphologically similar,
but diﬀer in acoustic and cuticular hydrocarbon phe-
noypes. Behavioral evolution involving these traits is
thought to have played a large role in the rapid and
extensive diversiﬁcation of this genus. Pre and postzy-
gotic reproductive incompatibilities will be quantiﬁed
and parallel evolution and genetic architectures of the
constituent traits will be evaluated between multiple
species pairs.
Requirements:
The desired candidate will possess an interest in / expe-
rience with quantitative genetics, experimental design,
behavioral observation, and associated statistical anal-
yses. Knowledge of basic molecular laboratory skills
(such as DNA/RNA extraction and PCR) is desirable
but not essential. An interest in the neurological basis
of behavior and/or the evolution of premating isolation
would be beneﬁcial but no prior knowledge in these ar-
eas is required.
Cornell University has many labs dedicated to the study
of behavior and ecology of speciation, speciation and
evolutionary genetics. As such, it provides a rich aca-
demic environment for those interested in proximate
and ultimate causes of behavioral evolution and speci-
ation.
The position can be ﬁlled immediately and at least
two years of funding are available. To apply, email a
statement of research interests, a curriculum vitae, and

Paris Comparative genomics and
metagenomics
Postdoc: Paris.Comparative genomics andmetagenomics
The team ?Mod´ elisation des Syst` emes Dynamiques
Int´ egr´ es (UMR CNRS 7138, UPMC, Paris)?, located
by the Seine river and next to the ?Jardin des Plantes?,
specializes in comparative genomics and comparative
metagenomics via the reconstruction of phylogenetic
trees and networks. In particular, we study the impact
of mobile elements (viruses, plasmids and integrons)
on the evolution of prokaryotic genomes (bacteria
and archaea), looking at the rules that inﬂuence
lateral gene transfer between these entities, with a
focus on the inﬂuence of the environment on gene
ﬂow. These questions are hot topics in evolutionary
biology and they are highly debated. Molecular data
from complete genomes and from environmental DNA
projects are both increasingly abundant. Their study
opens new avenues to gain original knowledge on the
evolutionary processes acting on prokaryotes. At the
same time, the classical model of a single evolutionary
tree appears too rigid to successfully account for the
fact that contemporary bacteria regularly exchange
genetic material, even when they are not closely
related. As a result, the universal tree model is
being replaced by more reticulate models. This major
transition must be followed by the development of
new methods to detect clusters of genes that share
the same phylogenetic history in order to fully study
the evolution of prokaryotic genomes. We are oﬀering
a postdoctoral position to compare the evolutionary
history of genes in the presence of multiple lateral
gene transfers, for very large molecular datasets. The
methods will aim at (i) clarifying the rules of lateral
gene transfer between mobile elements and bacterial
genomes and (ii) achieving a systematic identiﬁcation
of the adaptation resulting from lateral gene transfer
in the 3 domains of life. To this end, the candidate will
beneﬁt from existing datasets comprising (i) hundreds
of thousands of genes from mobile elements and of
prokaryotic genes, and (ii) thousands of eukaryotic
genes. This postdoctoral work (one year to two
years, starting in November 2009 at the latest) will
be part of a large ongoing international collaboration
with well-known specialists of phylogenetic networks
(including T. Dagan and W. Martin (Germany), and
F.J. Lapointe (Canada)). Gross salary will be at least2150 euros/month without taxes. The candidate must
be a recognized computer scientist (with programming
and algorithmic skills), and ideally knowledge in the
mathematics of networks, and/or in statistics. A
background in molecular evolution will be strongly
appreciated. Please, do apply and send your resume to

tal or deliberate introductions by humans. The South
African population of this species originated from cap-
tive birds that escaped in Durban in 1902. A cen-
tury later, the common myna has become abundant
throughout much of South Africa and is considered to
pose a serious threat to indigenous biodiversity. This
species has signiﬁcant potential to spread further in
southern Africa as populations are expanding north
into Limpopo, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and west and
south-west into the Free State and Eastern Cape.
Except for the occasional documentation of their overall
distribution range, very little is known about the gen-
eral movement dynamics of mynas. Using molecular
techniques and ecological principals, this project will
investigate questions related to common mynas focus-
ing on (i) the spatial distribution of genetic variation,
(ii) movement patterns in relation to certain landscape
variables, (iii) factors aﬀecting the relationship between
genetic diversity and gene ﬂow, (iv) source and sink
populations, and (v) the distance decay of genetic sim-
ilarity and gene ﬂow.
Fieldwork will be conducted across the full distribution
range of the common myna in South Africa. Work will
be conducted in conjunction with the University of Pre-
toria and Stellenbosch University and time will there-
fore be spend at both universities. Field experience
working with birds and a strong molecular background
is an advantage.*Please send a CV and full academic record,

StonyBrook 3 EvolutionaryGenetics
Three Postdoctoral Positions in Evolutionary Genetics
at Stony Brook
NSF and NIH-supported postdoctoral positions are
available in the laboratory of Walt Eanes at Stony
Brook University. The ﬁrst position is to work on the
physiological genetics of insect ﬂight metabolism using
Drosophila melanogaster as a model (see Eanes et al.
2006. Flux control and excess capacity in the enzymes
of glycolysis and their relationship to ﬂight metabolism
in Drosophila melanogaster. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 103: 19413-19418). The second position (a collab-
oration with Pal Schmidt at Penn) will study the popu-
lation and functional genetics of the couch potato gene,
diapause and life history variation in D. melanogaster
(see Schmidt et al. 2008. An amino acid polymorphism
in the couch potato gene forms the basis for climatic
adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster. Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105:16207-16211.). The third posi-
tion, in collaboration with the lab of John True, will
study the role that the major central metabolic and
dopamine pathways play in the mechanism of nutrient
or energy-state sensing and life history adaptation in
Drosophila.
All three positions are available this fall, and there is
ﬂexibility in start dates. All three have an initial term
of two years with the possibility of renewal.
Successful applicants should possess a Ph.D. andAugust 1, 2009 EvolDir 71
could possess skills in any of several areas including
Drosophila genetics, molecular evolution, and popula-
tion, or physiological genetics.

Project :
Parasitic wasps from the braconid family and their lep-
idopteran hosts have antagonistic relationships : wasps
introduce their eggs in the caterpillar together with
virus particles to alter host immunity and development.
The genes encoding virus particle components have re-
cently been identiﬁed in the wasp genome in collabora-
tion with the National Center for Sequencing- Genso-
scope (B´ ezier et al. Science 2009). These genes origi-
nated from a nudivirus (nudiviruses are related to bac-
uloviruses) whose genome was captured by an ancestor
wasp that lived 100 million years ago. Since this inte-
gration event the nudivirus genes have lost the ability
to be encapsidated in virus particles. The particles are
used to deliver wasp genes into the lepidopteran host
to manipulate host physiology. The post-doctoral re-
search project aims at drawing a more complete pic-ture of the viral ancestor by isolating and sequencing
the genomic regions containing nudivirus genes from
wasps belonging to phylogenetically distant braconid
subfamilies. A second part of the project will ana-
lyze gall- forming wasps of oak and roses, these species
form a clade suggesting the ability to produce complex
and species-speciﬁc galls may have been acquired by a
unique evolutionary event. Sequencing of cDNAs from
ovaries, venom glands and salivary glands will allow the
identiﬁcation of genes potentially involved in gall induc-
tion and eventually of viral cDNAs (collaboration with
the Genoscope).

POSTDOC GRANT APPLICATION IN CONSERVA-
TION GENETICS
As part of an ongoing project funded by the Belgian
National Fund for Scientiﬁc Research (FNRS), and re-
alized by three Belgian labs (located in Univ. Mons-
Hainaut, UCLouvain-la-Neuve, and National Botanic
Garden), it is possible for non-Belgian young postdoc
researchers to APPLY for a three-year FNRS postdoc
grant. The topic of the project is “Key factors for
the persistence of fragmented populations of rare or
declining plant species and their preferential pollina-
tors: pollination patterns, inbreeding depression, gene
ﬂow and available resources”. Four insect-pollinated
plant species from fens are studied: Comarum palus-
tre, Menyanthes trifoliata, Vaccinium oxycoccos and
V. uliginosum, as well as the diversity and eﬃciency
of their pollinators. The study sites are located in
two regions in southern Belgium (Upper Ardenne and
Lorraine). They are protected areas (EU Natura 2000
zones and natural reserves) and ecologically managed
fens. This project is realized in collaboration with
the local nature managers and aims to contribute to
the long-term preservation of viable populations of fen
species in these highly threatened habitats.
We are looking for a plant population geneticist, who
will investigate population structure, outcrossing rates
and realized pollen ﬂow using DNA microsatellite mark-
ers. Therefore, training and experience in develop-
ment and use of microsatellite markers and in ge-
netic data analysis is required; experience in spatial
or landscape analyses would be an advantage. Being
able to work within a research team including PhD
students and international postdoc(s) is very impor-
tant. The candidate will be based at the National
Botanic Garden of Belgium (Meise; Olivier Raspe,
Fabienne Van Rossum; see http://www.br.fgov.be/-
RESEARCH/PROJECTS/ﬂoraofbelgium.php ).
The grant is for a full-time position, salary of 37000
euros/year, which represents a net monthly salary of
roughly 1900 euros, with social security cover.
IMPORTANT: to be qualiﬁed to apply to this grant,
the candidate must have obtained his /her PhD after
1 January 2004 (= max. 6 years at 1 January 2010),have a good CV (several publications in ecological, con-
servation or evolutionary journals) and did not stay in
Belgium for more than 24 months during the last 3
years.

UParisSud AlimentarySelection
Detection of multilocus selection in genes involved in
alimentary processes.
We propose a postdoctoral position ﬁnanced by theFrench Agence Nationale de la Recherche, project
NUTGENEVOL. This position is opened for two years,
with a beginning between September and November
2009. The NUTGENEVOL project consists in studying
the selection pressures that occurred on genes involved
in alimentary processes and associated with type II di-
abetes.
Before the major Neolithic transition ( ~10.000 yBP),
our hunter-gatherer ancestors certainly had a meat-
based diet, poor in carbohydrates and rich in protein.
Therefore, genes favouring insulin resistance and glu-
coneogenesis were selected for, in order to constantly
maintain suﬃcient level of glucose in the blood. These
potentially thrifty genes may now be detrimental in ur-
banized societies, because under the present high car-
bohydrate diet, insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis
may lead to metabolic disorders such as type II dia-
betes, obesity, and hypertension. To detect the selec-
tive pressures that occurred on these genes, we have
compared the genetic diversity of pastoralist and agri-
culturist populations in Central Asia, for which diﬀer-
ences in diet may have lead to diﬀerent selective pres-
sures on such genes (current project of a PhD student,
L. Segurel). Classical single-locus test have been per-
formed by this student for 11 candidate genes.
However, all the traits involved in this study are poly-
genic traits involved in gene networks, and a multilocus
approach would seem especially appropriate. There-
fore, the postdoctoral position within this project would
consist in developing methods for jointly analysing com-
bination of SNP in diﬀerent genes, as obtained in Cen-
tral Asia but also from public databases as HAPMAP,
in order to detect multilocus signals of selection. These
methods will be applied to both simulated and real
data, the simulated data being produced by a soft-
ware developed by another PhD student (J.-T. Bran-
denburg), but to which the postdoctoral fellow may also
contribute. This software will aim to simulate as accu-
rately as possible the evolution of genes involved in this
network.
Another aspect of the postdoctoral position will consist
in analysing ﬁnely the position and level of involvement
of each gene in the network, in order to test whether
the position in the network could inﬂuence the level of
selection occurring on these genes. A particular em-
phasis will be put on studying the level of pleiotropy of
these genes, as selective pressures may diﬀer for genes
involved in one vs. several diﬀerent functions. This
research on gene networks will be mostly performed
through searches in public databases.
The ideal candidate for this postdoctoral position
should have solid knowledge in population genetics,76 EvolDir August 1, 2009
bioinformatics, statistics, and use of databases.
This project is a joint collaboration between the lab-
oratories Ecologie, Syst´ ematique et Evolution located
at the Universit´ e de Paris-Sud in Orsay near Paris
and Eco-Anthropology located at the National Museum
of Natural History in Paris. The postdoctoral fellow
will be based in the ﬁrst laboratory but with frequent
interactions with the other laboratory (team of Eve-
lyne Heyer). Salary should be around 1900 euros per
month. Interested candidates should send their applica-
tion, preferentially by email, to Fr´ ed´ eric Austerlitz (see

ComparativeFunctionalGenomics
Postdoctoral position available in Comparative Func-
tional Genomics in the Zoological Museum at the Uni-
versity of Zurich in Switzerland
The research group in Evolutionary Biology and Bio-
diversity led by Professor Tony Wilson in the Zoo-
logical Museum at the University of Zurich ( http:/-
/www.zm.uzh.ch/agwilson/ ) is seeking a postdoctoral
associate for a position in comparative functional ge-
nomics. This position is funded for 1.5 years, beginning
in September 2009, with a yearly salary of ca. 80,000
Swiss Francs ($75,000US).
The postdoctoral associate will work on a project
which is using next-generation sequencing technologies
to study the development and elaboration of a novel re-
productive trait, male pregnancy, in syngnathid ﬁshes
(BioEssays 29: 884-896). Seahorse and pipeﬁsh males
have reproductive structures for brooding developing
embryos, but the complexity of these structures varies
across the group, from the simple ventral attachment
of eggs in some species of pipeﬁsh to the fully enclosed
pouch of the seahorse, in which males aerate, osmoreg-
ulate and provision embryos during their development
(Evolution 57: 1374-1386). The high degree of repro-
ductive variation in this group oﬀers exceptional oppor-
tunities to study the genetic regulation of male preg-
nancy in a comparative evolutionary framework.The candidate will develop a custom Agilent microarray
based on a 454 screen of the seahorse transcriptome and
will use this array to screen patterns of gene expression
in a set of syngnathid species that diﬀer in the complex-
ity of their brooding structures. By comparing patterns
of gene expression across species, we aim to clarify how
changes in the spatial and temporal expression of genes
have paralleled the development of the morphological,
physiological and hormonal traits that characterize the
most complex forms of male pregnancy in this group.
The ideal candidate will have experience in functional
genomics methodologies and familiarity with microar-
ray development and analysis in non-model organisms.
Bioinformatics experience would be an asset. Inter-
ested candidates should submit a Curriculum vitae
and statement of research interests, along with a list
of three references, by email or post to Dr. Wilson
(tony.wilson@zm.uzh.ch) before August 1, 2009.

MuseumDNAanalysis
Postdoc position in molecular biology / DNA isolation
from museum specimens
Two postdoc positions are available at Wageningen
University, Netherlands (28 months) and the Museum
of Natural History Berlin, Germany (30 months) condi-
tional to approval by the funding agency. The project
is part of a 4 year Joint Research Activity within the
SYNTHESYS2 programme funded by the European
Union FP7 and aims at developing eﬃcient DNA isola-
tion methods for the analysis of museum specimens and
will be integrated within a larger programme involving
ancient bone studies.Museum collections constitute a DNA archive allow-
ing us to explore genetic diversity in specimens over
the last 250 years. They are increasingly exploited as
ancient DNA repositories for DNA based systematic
and ecological studies, and represent years of collect-
ing eﬀorts, often in diﬃcult, complex and remote re-
gions, such as tropical rain forests, or ones that have
since been disturbed/ distroyed by human action. The
potential for high-throughput automated DNA extrac-
tion coupled with recent innovations in DNA sequenc-
ing technology (e.g., miniaturisation, pyrosequencing)
has highlighted the need for eﬃcient methods for re-
covering high quality DNA from historical specimens
for both evolutionary and diagnostic studies.
We are looking for two postdoctoral researchers with
experience with techniques in molecular biology, es-
pecially the extraction of DNA from animal and
plant/fungal tissues. The successful candidates should
have a good background or keen interest in the
(bio)chemistry of ancient museum specimen DNA
preservation, a good understanding of current system-
atic research practice, as well as of data basing. Good
communication skills, the ability to work independently
and to interact with diﬀerent taxonomist/museum com-
munities are prerequisites.
The two projects involve the following:
Plants/fungi (Wageningen)
P Identify the main obstacles to successful DNA ex-
traction/ ampliﬁcation from herbarium specimens.
P Optimise protocols for DNA extraction from old ( >70
yr), alcohol- preserved, or secondary metabolite-rich
herbarium specimens of a wide range of plants and fun-
gal clades, with a view to enabling subsequent large-
scale and high-throughput automation of DNA extrac-
tion from herbarium material.
P Assessment of post-mortem damage in old herbarium
specimens using next-generation sequencing
Invertebrates with muco-polysaccharide rich tissue
(Berlin)
P Develop and test safer and more eﬀective DNA iso-
lation procedure from muco-polysaccharide-rich tissue,
mainly molluscs, focussing on museum specimens of
varying age (5-150 years).
Both projects involve the setup of a web database as
an eﬃcient tool to disseminate protocols and user ex-
periences.
We oﬀer an intellectually stimulating research environ-
ment in some of Europes largest natural history muse-
ums with well-equipped state-of- the-art lab facilities,
and with partnerships in leading molecular systematic80 EvolDir August 1, 2009
labs in the Netherlands, the UK and Denmark.
The position at oﬀer at the Museum of Natural His-
tory Berlin will be full time at salary level IIa BAT-O
(Anwendungstarifvertrag HU Berlin). The Museum of
Natural History Berlin is an equal opportunities em-
ployer, applications by qualiﬁed women are particularly

The ecological impacts of some of the world’s most no-
torious invaders are well-documented. However, the im-
pacts of the majority of invaders may be small, whilst
native species can also have large ecological eﬀects.
This raises two important questions. First, are intro-
duced species fundamentally diﬀerent from natives, or
do they have similar ecological impacts? Second, do na-
tive and introduced species diﬀer in key ecological rela-
tionships or evolutionary processes, such as abundance-
impact, species-area or diversity-productivity?

technology is undergoing exceptional improvements.
Next-generation parallel sequencers can generate mil-
lions of DNA sequences overnight at reduced costs.
SNP detection technology is evolving fast from massive
microarray to a variety of lower scale and less expensive
technologies. These methods are changing the way of
planning research and experimental protocols in theo-
retical and applied evolutionary and population genet-
ics, and bioinformatics. Aim of the Summer School is to
introduce the new genomic approaches into the ﬁeld of
ecological and conservation genetics. Genomic methods
have been developed and applied mainly to the study
of human populations or model organisms. However,
genomic approaches are very well suited to the study
of natural populations, as well. Classical population
genetics in the last two decades made extensive use of
very limited numbers of ?neutral? markers (mainly mi-
crosatellites and mtDNA sequences), while the study of
functional genetic systems has been substantially lim-
ited. Consequently, it has been problematic (or even
impossible) to correlate such kind of population ge-
netic data with the main domains of functional pop-
ulation genetics, that is the dynamics of whole genome
heterozygosity and the genetic control of phenotypic
variation. Genome sequencing and the very ﬁrst pop-
ulation genomic data clearly indicate that a signiﬁcant
proportion of the population DNA diversity have been
selected and functionally diverged in response to evolu-
tionary adaptive pressures. Genomic methods might
straight overcome the limitations of classical genetic
marker approaches. Parallel sequencing and genome
scanning technologies allow genotyping thousands of
genes, covering both mutational diversity at the DNA
level, regulatory mechanisms and patterns of qualita-
tive or quantitative gene expression. In this way it is
now feasible to understanding the functional role of ge-
netic systems, the dynamics of selection processes and
the adaptive potential of natural populations to chang-
ing climate and environments.
The Summer School is dedicated to design the role
of next-generation sequencing and other genomic tech-
nologies as applied in the ﬁeld of population and con-
servation genetics. Particular emphasis will be given
to the study of functional genes and adaptation in nat-
ural non-model organisms. Aim of the School will be
to show how the new perspectives oﬀered by genomics
could be applied to solve theoretical and practical eco-
logical and conservation genetics problems. The School82 EvolDir August 1, 2009
will provide updated overview on major genomic meth-
ods, introduce case-studies in ecological genomics, and
in this way it will stimulate the audience to develop new
perspectives in the application of genomic methods in
the study of natural plant and animal populations. Par-
ticipants will be asked to share information and discuss
genomic research approaches in wildlife species to gain a
more profound understanding of the variation of genes
and their functions in evolution, ecology and conser-
vation. The School will emphasize the use of bioinfor-
matic tools and software, and will further stimulate col-
laboration among international research groups within
the ﬁeld of ecological genomics.
The School, organized by Ettore Randi (Bologna) and
Cino Pertoldi (Aarhus), consists in four full-day ses-
sions with an adequate balance between theory and
computer practice, oriented to handle genomic data
bases, solve problems and hypothesis testing. There
will be morning and afternoon sessions featuring invited
speakers, practical computer sessions, and evening
poster session dedicated to the students? own research
projects. The School is primarily intended for young
researchers at the doctoral and post-doctoral stages.
Participants must have their own laptop computer and
have software applications installed (information re-
garding the software a will be provided by the orga-
nizers in advance). Candidates should preferably have
some background in genomics and conservation genet-
ics, as well as some experience in bioinformatics, and
molecular evolutionary biology.

Beyond BLAST and FASTA - Alignment: from pro-
teins to genomes - This course presents a comprehen-
sive overview of the theory and practice of computa-
tional methods for extracting the maximum amount of
information from protein and DNA sequence similarity
through sequence database searches, statistical analy-
sis, and multiple sequence alignment, and genome scale
alignment. Additional topics include identifying signals
in unaligned sequences, integration of genetic and se-
quence information in biological databases. This year,
there will be a focus on metagenomics and functional
prediction.
The course combines lectures with hands-on exercises;
students are encouraged to pose challenging sequence
analysis problems using their own data. The course
makes extensive use of local WWW pages to present
problem sets and the computing tools to solve them.
Students use Windows and Mac workstations attached
to a UNIX server.
The course is designed for biologists seeking advanced
training in biological sequence analysis, computational
biology core resource directors and staﬀ, and for scien-
tists in other disciplines, such as computer science, who
wish to survey current research problems in biological
sequence analysis and comparative genomics.
The primary focus of the Computational and Compar-
ative Genomics Course is the theory and practice of al-
gorithms used in computational biology, with the goal
of using current methods more eﬀectively and develop-
ing new algorithms. Cold Spring Harbor also oﬀers a

we will conduct data analyses together for 30-60 min-
utes using relevant software programs and real data
sets. Evening hands-on computer sessions and housing
together of instructors and students in the same loca-
tion (Lakeside cabins) will allow for extensive exchange
and facilitate learning. Participants will receive the in-
structors’ PowerPoint slides, example exercises, meals,
lodging, transportation to/from airport, & a visit to a
wildlife/natural area guided by expert ecologists and
geneticists.

First announcement - EPSRC workshop: Evolution of
Stress Responses, 18-19 September 2009, University of
Aberdeen, UK
This EPSRC funded workshop will bring together ex-
perimentalists and theoreticians and will broadly cover
eukaryotic and prokaryotic stress responses at both
cell and population levels under the following general
themes:
1. molecular mechanisms governing biochemical, ge-
netic and physiological responses 2. the ability to sense
and respond to the environment

UFreiburg ForestGenetics Oct7-9
I would like to bring the following workshop to your
attention: “Opportunities, challenges and limitations
of genomics-based technologies in forest tree breeding
and forest genetics”. This workshop will be held from
October 07 until October 09 2009 in Freiburg and is
organised by the Forest Research Institute of Baden-August 1, 2009 EvolDir 85
W¨ urttemberg (FVA), the Institute of Tree Physiologie
at the University of Freiburg, and the regional oﬃce
EFICENT of the European Forest Institute (EFI).
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for pop-
ulation geneticists, evolutionary biologists and molecu-
lar ecologists to evaluate the state of the art in forest
tree genetics and genomics and to discuss how to ap-
ply that information to genomics-based research in gene
conservation, selection and breeding.
A detailed programme including a list of in-
vited speakers, details on the registration and
further information can be obtained at http://-
www.eﬁ.int/portal/news events/events/extra/2009/-
workshop forest genetics/ Registration already ends
by August 31 2009. Please note that the total number
of participants is limited to 50 in order to make this
an eﬃcient workshop with intensive discussions.
Thanks in advance,

Nov9-Dec18
I am pleased to announce this year’s morphometrics
course from the University of Manchester. This year’s
course will run in the six weeks from 9 November to 18
December 2009.
The course information can be found on the following
we site: http://www.ﬂywings.org.uk/MorphoCourse
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Deﬁni-
tions of size and shape * Geometric methods to char-
acterise shape from a conﬁguration of landmark points
(Procrustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation,
scatter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal
component analysis * Measurement error and outliers
* Shape transformations and ’warping’ – the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing
between groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) *
Allometry and size correction * Inﬂuence of external
factors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response stud-
ies) * Symmetric forms and measurement of asymme-
try. * Morphometric inferences on developmental pro-
cesses, morphological integration, modularity * Genet-
ics of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives,
QTL analyses. * Phylogeny: reconstructing the evolu-
tion of shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-
cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software ( http://www.ﬂywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm ). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a ’workshop’ feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphometric
studies. This activity stimulates discussion and pro-
vides a broad overview of questions that can be ad-
dressed with morphometric methods.
The fee for the course is GBP 190.00 (I’m afraid it’s
gone up a bit from last year – but the UK pound has
dropped against most other currencies...).
All prospective participants need to pre-register for the
course. The deadline for this is the *31 August 2009*.86 EvolDir August 1, 2009

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
