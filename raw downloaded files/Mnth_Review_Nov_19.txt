21stYOUNG SYSTEMATISTS??? FORUM Friday
22nd November 2019, 9:30 am Venue: Flett Lecture
Theatre, Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists??? Forum represents
an exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration isFREE. Please register here https:/-

ple Doe Jane YSF2019.doc.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website

CallForSymposia
Dear SMBE Member,
We're delighted to announce that the Society for Molec-
ular Biology & Evolution will be accepting proposals for
symposium topics for the 2020 Annual Meeting from 9
September 2019. SMBE 2020 is taking place in Qu ebec
City, Canada, from 28th June to 2nd July 2020. *The
deadline for symposia applications is 10 October 2019.*
Please visit the SMBE 2020 website - smbe2020.org/call-
for-symposia - to access information and the submission
portal.
Proposals will be reviewed by the committee with
around 20-30 topics selected for inclusion within the
scientic programme.
*Key dates*
*-10 October 2019* - Deadline for symposia applications
*-18 November 2019* - Abstract submission opens*-20 January midnight GMT 2020* - Abstract submis-
sion deadline
*-24 January 2020* - Abstract review commences
Proposals should span the range of interests of SMBE
members, including exciting new scientic developments,
and should represent the geographic and gender diver-
sity of our membership. To ensure the meeting is fully
accessible to international participants, the conference
organisers will provide supporting documentation and
advice for visa applications to Canada. For each ac-
cepted symposium, SMBE will provide partial nancial
support to help attract outstanding invited speakers.
*Symposium Proposal Guidelines*
Please review the following guidelines before submitting
a Symposium Proposal:
- Individuals can only be listed as an organiser for one
symposium proposal, although organisers can be listed
as an invited speaker on another proposal
- Each symposium will include one invited speaker plus
a number of contributed speakers
- All invited speakers included within a symposium
should have verbally agreed to be involved before the
proposal is submitted
- An individual can only give one talk at the SMBE
meeting, so in the event that a speaker is invited to two
successful symposium applications the organisers should
consider a back up
- The Society provides nancial support to facilitate
symposium organisers in attracting outstanding invited
speakers
- Symposium organisers should provide a description
of the symposium (250 words max) that will be made
public if selected. The symposium organisers will also
provide a description of how their proposal brings for-
ward the SMBE's objective of equity and diversity, as
well as any additional information for the committee to
make an informed review (250 words max).
- The symposia proposals selected for inclusion within
the SMBE 2020 scientic programme will then be listed
on the abstract submission portal, which will open in
November 2019, for members to indicate that they would
want their contributed talk to be featured in a specic
symposia.

Jan12 DeadlineOct24
Dear colleagues,
There will be a \Forest Tree Genomics" workshop atthe International PAG XXVII conference in January in
San Diego (http://www.intlpag.org/) on Jan 12th from
8 - 12:40 pm.
To get an overview of the 2019 Forest Tree Genomics ses-
sion, visit this link: https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvii/-
meetingapp.cgi/Session/5505 . As in recent years, we
are soliciting draft abstracts to be considered for oral pre-
sentation at the workshop. We screen abstracts to select
presentations for the workshop, taking into account the
quality of the science, novelty of the results, and organis-
mal, geographic, and research group diversity. Students
and post-doctorates are especially encouraged to apply.
Please note that PAG policy does not allow the same
speaker to speak at the workshop more than two years in
a row. If you would like to be considered for an oral pre-
sentation at the PAG Forest Tree Workshop, you must
submit a draft abstract (250 word maximum) to this
web site (http://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/forest-tree-
workshop-abstract-submission/) no later than THURS-
DAY OCTOBER 24, 2019. That will give us time to
evaluate submitted abstracts, select speakers, and in-
form them by FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25. Those selected
and conrmed for oral presentations by this process will
be asked to register and submit their abstracts online as
invited speakers in the Forest Tree Workshop no later
than THURSDAY, OCTOBER 31. Those selected as
poster presenters should submit their poster abstracts
directly to PAG no later than SUNDAY OCTOBER
27, 2019. A small number of poster presenters will be
invited to give an \elevator talk" (brief synopsis of their
poster) at the workshop session. PAG early-bird regis-
tration deadline runs until NOV 1, and standard rates
apply on NOV 2. We look forward to receiving your
abstracts!

Early Bird Deadline - 5 November!
A forum for scientists interested in applying systems
and mechanistic approaches to understand evolution.
Important deadlines - Early bird : 05 November 2019
Bursary: 19 November 2019 Abstract: deadline 03 De-
cember 2019 Registration: 14 January 2020
We are pleased to announce the third meeting on Evolu-
tionary Systems Biology. This conference will provide a
forum for scientists interested in applying systems and
mechanistic approaches to understand evolution.
Advances in genome sequencing and computational biol-
ogy are providing unprecedented insights into biological
mechanisms and evolutionary processes. In parallel,
gene editing tools are revolutionising what is possible in
model and non-model organisms. This conference will
explore the evolution of biological systems at dierent
levels: from genes and molecules to organism develop-
ment and physiology. Particular emphasis will be placed
on understanding evolution through mechanistic biol-
ogy. We will explore recent advances in experimental
and theoretical approaches to study how genetic and
non-genetic changes fuel and constrain evolution.
The conference will oer a valuable training ground
and rich learning experience and provide networking
opportunities for scientists across disciplines relevant to
systems biology. It should be of particular interest to
those working at the interface of evolution, quantitative
genetics, and systems biology.
Topics will include:
Transcriptional regulation Cellular diversity Computa-
tional networks Evo-devo Single cell analysis Evolution
of tness landscapes

Graduate School Comparative Biology Ph.D. Program
|and Graduate Fellowships Program
The AMNH RGGS Ph.D. Program in Comparative Biol-
ogy is training the next generation of biologists through
an integrative approach that focuses on the history, evo-
lutionary relationships, and interactions among species.
It utilizes the Museum's strength and experience in
research and training to educate a new generation of
scientists and industry leaders. The AMNH provides ex-
ceptional support facilities for student research, with col-
lections of more than 33 million specimens and artifacts.
Training and research opportunities exist across a wide
array of disciplines in comparative biology, incorporating
research in systematic and evolutionary biology, pale-
ontology, conservation biology, comparative genomics,
computational biology, Earth history, anthropology, and
biological and cultural diversity. Global eldwork, with
AMNH faculty, student-led or in partnership with others,
provides exceptional research opportunities for students.
RGGS students may take advantage of RGGS course
cross-enrollment agreements with partner universities
Columbia and the City University of New York. Armed
with a Gilder School education, graduates will not only
understand the history and diversity of life on Earth, but
may contribute to advances in human health, biodiver-
sity conservation, and other related biological research
elds as well.
This is an accelerated program, designed for studentsto complete their degrees in four years. Students will
earn a minimum of 62 credits through a combination of
coursework, teaching assistantships, and individual dis-
sertation research. The Richard Gilder Graduate School
will typically provide full nancial support to students
matriculating in the Comparative Biology Ph.D. Pro-
gram.
We also oer Graduate Fellowships for students inter-
ested in earning a Ph.D. at one of our partner institu-
tions (Columbia University, CUNY, NYU, Stony Brook
and Cornell University), when they are advised by an
AMNH curator.
The AMNH Graduate Student Fellowship Program is
an educational partnership with selected universities,
dedicated to the training of Ph.D. candidates in those
scientic disciplines practiced at the Museum. Our
current collaborations are with Columbia University,
City University of New York (CUNY), Cornell Univer-
sity, Stony Brook University, and New York University
(NYU). The host university in which the student en-
rolls exercises educational jurisdiction over the students
and formally awards the degree. In these partnership
programs, at least one Museum curator must serve as a
graduate advisor, co-major professor or major professor,
and adjunct university faculty member. Each student
benets by having the sta and facilities of both the
university and the Museum to support his/her training
and research. To be eligible for the AMNH Graduate
Fellowship, students must apply to both the host Uni-
versity's Ph.D. program and to the AMNH Graduate
Student Fellowships Program. Students already matric-
ulated in a Ph.D. program are not eligible to apply; only
new, rst-time Ph.D. applicants will be considered.

Barcelona PredictingEvolution
Graduate student position (for a PhD) in predicting
evolution:
Autonomous University of Barcelona, Genetics and Mi-
crobiology Department
1.Job/ project description:
The research will involve using and rening an existing
mathematical model of wing morphogenesis to explore
whether it can be used to predict how wing morphol-
ogy changes over generations in an articial selection
experiment. These predictions would be contrasted
with predictions stemming from a quantitative genetics
analysis of y populations.
2. Background:
Why organisms are the way they are?
Can we understand the processes by which complex
organisms are built in each generation and how these
evolved?
The process of embryonic development is now widely ac-
knowledged to be crucial to understand evolution since
any change in the phenotype in evolution (e.g. morphol-
ogy) is rst a change in the developmental process by
which this phenotype is produced. Over the years we
have come to learn that there is a set of developmental
rules that determine which phenotypic variation canNovember 1, 2019 EvolDir 17
possibly arise in populations due to genetic mutation
(the so called genotype-phenotype map). Since natural
selection can act only on existing phenotypic variation,
these rules of development have an eect on the direction
of evolutionary change.
Our group is devoted to understand these developmental
rules and how these can help to better understand the
direction of evolutionary change. The ultimate goal is
to modify evolutionary theory by considering not only
natural selection in populations but also developmen-
tal biology in populations. For that aim we combine
mathematical models of embryonic development that
relate genetic variation to morphological variation with
population models. The former models are based on
what is currently known in developmental biology.
There are two traditional approaches to study pheno-
typic evolution. One is quantitative genetics and one
is developmental evolutionary biology. The former is
based in the statistics of the association between ge-
netic relatedness and phenotypic variation between in-
dividuals in populations, the latter in the genetic and
bio-mechanical manipulation of the development of lab
individuals. While the former models trait variation
with an statistical linear approach the latter models it by
deterministic non-linear models of gene networks and tis-
sue bio-mechanics. For the most, these two approaches
are largely isolated from each other.
The current project aims to contrast and put together
these two approaches in a specic easy to study system:
the y wing. In brief, we are growing y populations
and, in each generation, we select the founders of the
next generation based on how close they resemble an
arbitrary optimal morphology in their wings (based on
the proportions between several of their traits). In each
generation also, we estimate the G matrix and the selec-
tion gradient to see how well one can predict evolution
in the next generation. The quantitative genetics predic-
tions will be contrasted with the predictions stemming
from a wing morphogenesis model that we built based
on our current understanding of wing developmental
biology (see Dev Cell. 2015 Aug 10;34(3):310-22 for
the model and for slightly similar approaches: Nature.
2013 May 16;497(7449):361-4. and Nature. 2010 Mar
25;464(7288):583-6).
3. Requirements:
The applicant must hold a Degree in Biology or similar.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them is
required.
The most important requirement is a strong interest
and motivation on science and evolution. A capacity for
creative and critical thinking is also required.4. Description of the position:
The fellowship will be for a period of 4 years (100%
research work: no teaching involved).
Salary according to Spanish pre-doc salaries.
5. The application must include:
-Motivation letter including a statement of interests
-CV (summarizing degrees obtained, subjects included
in degree and grades, average grade).
-Application should be sent to: isaac.salazar@uab.cat
No ocial documents are required for the application
rst stage but these may be required latter on.

Vincent Richards' lab in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Clemson University is accepting applications
for a PhD position.
The overarching research theme will focus on the oral
microbiome and the relationship between the bacterial
and fungal components of this community. Specic
questions include how these taxa respond and adapt to
this dynamic environment. Operating over numerous
time scales, multiple host factors such as diet, health,
disease, and host genotype can impact the oral envi-
ronment and hence are strong evolutionary forces that
can shape and select for changes within the commu-
nity. We are particularly interested in the interplay and
co-evolution of bacterial and fungal components of the
community and how these processes are impacted by
immunosuppression. Multiple omic approaches such as
comparative genomics, metagenomics, and metatran-
scriptomics will be coupled with network analyses to
address these questions.
Desirable skills include experience analyzing next-
generation sequence data and prociency with
Linux/bash. However, these are not absolute require-
ments as the student will be trained in numerous omic
and bioinformatic approaches. Importantly, the student
should possess a great deal of enthusiasm, curiosity, and
imagination.
The position will be available Fall 2020 and the
salary will initially range between $22,000/year and
$25,000/year plus benets and tuition (commensurate
with experience and qualications). Increases are possi-
ble. Applicants should contact Vincent Richards directly

SplicingEvolution
Nearly all the genes in vertebrates undergo alternative
splicing, the process through which dierent transcripts
are generated from a single gene. Despite alternative
splicing being common, tissue and developmental stage
specic regulation of splicing, and the importance of this
mechanism in fundamental biological processes remain
little understood.
The aim of the project is to provide a novel under-
standing of the importance and regulation of alternative
splicing in the ADAMTS gene family during develop-
ment. ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase
with /thrombospondin type I motifs) proteins are se-
creted enzymes with roles in tissue morphogenesis and
many diseases. The student will use both computational
and experimental approaches to annotate and function-
ally characterize transcripts through in-situ expression
assays and gene manipulations in the model organism
Xenopus.
We oer a highly collaborative PhD project between
three research groups (Haerty: bioinformatics, Wheeler:
cell and developmental biology, Edwards: developmental
and cancer biology) combining computational biology
and experimental developmental biology to investigate
the diversity and function of alternatively spliced tran-
scripts originating from genes of the ADAMTS family.
The PhD student will gain expertise in computational
biology, large datasets analysis, transcriptomics, long
read sequencing technologies, genetics, microscopy and
developmental biology.
This project has been shortlisted for funding by the Nor-
wich Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership (NR-PDTP). Shortlisted applicants will be interviewed as
part of the studentship competition. Candidates will be
interviewed on either the 7th, 8th or 9th January 2020.
The NRP DTP oers postgraduates the opportunity to
undertake a 4-year research project whilst enhancing
professional development and research skills through
a comprehensive training programme. You will join a
vibrant community of world-leading researchers. All NR-
PDTP students undertake a three-month professional
internship (PIPS) during their study. The internship
oers exciting and invaluable work experience designed
to enhance professional development. Full support and
advice will be provided by our Professional Internship
team. Students with, or expecting to attain, at least an
upper second-class honours degree, or equivalent, are
invited to apply.

ECU Perth PlantGenomics
GraduatePositions: ECU.PlantGenomics.Snapdragons.Eucalyptus
Graduate positions in plant evolutionary genet-

tralia.
PhD positions (1-2) are available in the lab
of Dr. David Field at Edith Cowan Univer-
sity (https://www.ecu.edu.au/schools/science/sta/-November 1, 2019 EvolDir 21
proles/lecturers/dr-david-luke-eld) for early or mid
2020 start.
Our lab is broadly interested in questions related to
plant evolutionary genetics and ecology. We integrate
high-throughput genomics, eld-based experiments and
theoretical modelling to answer fundamental questions
related to local adaptation, speciation, mating systems
and genetic rescue.
There are two potential topics for PhD projects using
natural hybrid zones as natural laboratories to under-
stand the genetic basis of reproductive isolation:
1. The maintenance of tness landscapes in the face
of gene ow. In this project we are using genotype by
sequencing and whole genomes, GWAS and cline theory
to understand how divergent traits and heritable tness
variation is distributed in relation to known barrier loci.
We are using hybrid zones between Antirrhinum (Snap-
dragons), a tractable model plant with a well-established
link from genotype to phenotype. This project is part
of an FWF (Austrian Science Fund) grant in collabo-
ration with Prof. Nick Barton (IST Austria) and Prof.
Enrico Coen (John Innes Centre). Candidates will be
expected to spend some time in the eld (with an in-
ternational team) in the Spanish Pyrenees. 2. Origins
and remolding of genomic divergence between frequently
hybridizing Eucalypts. This is a diverse genus ( ~700
species) that dominates the overstorey of Australia and
is a key component of many ecosystems on the continent.
Ample genetic resources and frequent hybrid zones pro-
vides a rich test bed for evolutionary questions related
to speciation and the genetic basis of reproductive iso-
lation. Using genome-wide sequence data, we are using
demographic modelling and coalescent approaches to
build a picture of the history of divergence between four
Eucalyptus species with replicate hybrid zones in East-
ern Australia. Synergies with the snapdragon project
will provide opportunities for testing these models in
both systems.
Applicants must have prior research experience and a
bachelors (with 1st class honours) and/or masters de-
gree in biology, genetics, or other quantitative elds.
Ideal applicants are those with experience in evolution,
population genetics/genomics and bioinformatics. Rea-
sonable quantitative skills and programming experience
is required (e.g. R and/or Python).
Position funding and application: 3.5 years of liv-
ing stipend is available for both domestic and
overseas students through multiple Edith Cowan
University schemes (see here for more informa-
tion: https://intranet.ecu.edu.au/research/for-research-
students/overview). These positions are funded inter-
nally through ECU and the School of Science and includestipend, health insurance, tuition waiver and relocation
expenses (domestic only). Acceptance is contingent
on students meeting Edith Cowan University general
admission criteria.
PhD candidates must apply through ocial entry
scheme to the School of Science (see research schol-
arships, ECU Higher Degree by Research Scholarship
at https://intranet.ecu.edu.au/research/for-research-
students/opportunities-for-research-students). Please

Genomics, bioinformatics and evolution of inherited
chromosomal integrated human herpesvirus6
Project Description
We are inviting applications for a 3-4 year PhD student
in the area of bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics
of endogenous Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6).
This project uses bioinformatics and evolutionary ge-
nomics to unravel the biology of integrated Human Her-
pesvirus 6. In humans, ~1% carry a heritable HHV-6
genome, which sits in the telomeres of various chro-22 EvolDir November 1, 2019
mosomes. HHV-6 and the inherited form are involved
in various diseases including graft rejection and heart
disease. We want to understand the basics of how the
genome integrates, why is it maintained through gener-
ations and what the consequences of its presence are.
The successful candidate will learn and apply bioin-
formatics techniques to analyse human genome data
containing the viral sequence, in order to understand
the evolutionary history and ongoing biology of HHV-6
integration. The project will be supervised by Dr. Amr
Aswad and Professor Kaufer in the institute of virology
at the Freie University of Berlin. The Kaufer lab consists
of range of students and postdocs from international
backgrounds and a wide range of interests and skills.
The successful candidate should have a keen interest
in genomics and evolutionary biology, as well as an en-
thusiasm for large scale data analysis. As part of a
wider team of virologists, the candidate will have the
opportunity to collaborate with wet bench colleagues
to generate new data and address questions beyond the
scope of computational analyses.
The successful candidate must:
- hold a degree in biology or similar. Candidates from
a computer science or similar background will also be
considered - Have at least a basic understanding of com-
puter programming (or a willingness to learn!) - Must
have strong command of written and spoken English
- Demonstrate sincere interest in the project (research
the subject before applying!)
The ideal candidate will:
- Have some experience in the area of computational bi-
ology or similar - Have an understanding of evolutionary
biology and phylogenetics techniques and theory - have
a proven record of independent research skills - have an
active interest in the area of next generation sequencing,
genomics, bioinformatics, virology
How to Apply :
Please send an email toamr.aswad@fu-berlin.dewith
your CV (1-2 pages) and a short paragraph explain-
ing your interest in this project and why you would
make a good candidate.
Funding Notes Various funding opportunities depending
on country of origin. While there are no tuition fees,

This project combines eld work with wild birds, some
aviary work with the consequences of spring warming.
You will learn to handle small animals, conduct quanti-
tative data analyses and (to a limited extend) analyse
laboratory data.
Variation in the gut microbiome is associated with mul-
tiple traits in mammals, ranging from behavioural and
neurotypical traits to immunity, disease resistance and
metabolism. There is also growing evidence that at least
some mechanisms are causal, with poor health condi-
tions caused by variation, or changes in the variation, of
the gut microbiome. Gut microbiome variation is largely
shaped by environmental factors, in particular social en-
vironment, and diet. Variation in food source, nutrient
composition and nutrient quality, particularly in early
life are likely to play a larger role in birds, where chicks
hatching from eggs are not primed with the microbiome
of their mother. Thus, we can predict variation in the
gut microbiome of avian ospring born during periods
of temporal uctuation in prey availability.
Recently, changes in seasonal food availability have be-
come more pronounced for organisms that experience
a mismatch between own and prey phenology. Climate
change can lead to advancing phenologies, in particu-
lar in temperate regions. However, not all organisms
manage to adapt to an earlier spring phenology. For
instance, seasonal insects, such as certain caterpillars,
rely and feed on leaves only during the budburst period
in early spring, before they pupate. Birds that forage on
these caterpillars to feed them to their ospring typically
time their breeding to overlap with the peak occurrence
of the preferred prey items. However, with a shift to
earlier budburst period the caterpillar occurrence ad-
vances to earlier dates. Those birds that struggle to
match their breeding time will provide their ospring
with dierent, potentially more diverse food items, and
thus develop dierent gut microbiomes. As the early
life gut microbiome of a bird determines its adult gut
microbiome, a mismatch in the timing of breeding can
have lasting consequences through variation in the gut
microbiome.
However, not much is known about the role of the gut
microbiome in birds. While we have shown that the
early life environment plays an important role contrast-
ing a relatively small role of genetic relatedness, studies24 EvolDir November 1, 2019
on wild population remain rare. In this project we will
test the hypotheses that (a) dierences in early life diet
aect early life, and adult avian microbiome, that (b)
the avian gut microbiome will vary with timing of breed-
ing, and that (c) this can lead to long-lasting tness
consequences.
We will test this using an experimental approach in a
wild blue tit population and in aviary birds. The project
is based in Silwood Park Campus of Imperial College
London. To apply, please email your university tran-
scripts and your degree nal outcome, your CV, a letter
of motivation, and the email addresses of two potential
references to Julia.schroeder@imperial.ac.uk.

The research unit Evolutionary Marine Ecology is oer-
ing a
*PhD position (m/w/d)*
starting on 02.01.2020 or upon agreement. The PhD
position (3 years and 2,5 months xed-term, 65% TV-L
E13) is embedded within the Research Training Group
*RTG 2501 Translational Evolutionary Research* (RTG
TransEvo) nanced by the German Research Founda-
tion (DFG). The research will be conducted at the
GEOMAR- Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in
Kiel.
Evolution is the central theory of the life sciences. The
core objective of the RTG TransEvo is to study andpromote its key relevance to applied problems. We aim
to adopt knowledge and concepts from fundamental re-
search in evolutionary biology in order to enhance our
understanding of current challenges in applied elds,
and *vice versa*, use novel insights to enrich our under-
standing of evolution. The RTG TransEvo promotes the
translation of evolutionary thinking into three applied
elds: medicine, food production and wildlife conserva-
tion. The training of the doctoral candidates is explic-
itly interdisciplinary and organized in tandem projects.
Each of these consist of two sub-projects that address a
related problem, yet use distinct albeit complementary
research approaches, directly generating potential for
synergistic interactions. The doctoral projects will be
developed together with the selected PhD students.
In the Research Group \Parental investment and im-
mune dynamics, we study the evolution of pregnancy
focusing on the unique example of male pregnancy in
sex-role reversed syngnathids (pipeshes and seahorses).
Syngnathids have evolved on a gradient from external
fertilization to full pregnancy and are, thus, ideal to
study the evolution of pregnancy. Experimentally we in-
vestigate changes in the immune system with male preg-
nancy evolution and assess its molecular basis. To do so,
we combine a diversity of molecular and developmental
biological methods, genetic engineering (CRISPR/ cas9)
with comparative genomics and transcriptomics.
In this project with Tandem Partner Almut Nebel, we
strive to identify the sex-specic link between fertility,
pregnancy and longevity. Women are under selection
for later menopause and older age at last child, and a
growing number of studies show a positive correlation
between the age at last birth and healthy longevity of
the mother. That brothers of women who have chil-
dren late also live longer suggests a genetic link between
the postponing of sexual selection and ageing, which
is further supported by genes that inuence both age
at menopause and ovary reservoir. Egg production,
pregnancy, and breast-feeding are in humans united in
maternal investment. In the unique male pregnancy
of pipeshes and seahorses, the provisioning of eggs
and parental investment are decoupled. Pipeshes and
seahorses are thus ideally suited for an experimental
validation of how fertility, pregnancy and longevity are
connected and to determine, which roles the egg pro-
ducing females and the pregnant males play.
In this PhD project, we aim to experimentally analyze
the late-life fertility/pregnancy and longevity trade-o
in the sex-role reversed pipesh *Syngnathus typhle*
and its sex-specicity. We then want to identify the
molecular and functional basis of pregnancy, fertility and
longevity in conventional and sex-role reversed lifestyle
using transcriptomics and modications of key preg-November 1, 2019 EvolDir 25
nancy/fertility genes using CRISPR/Cas9. In the tan-
dem project the focus is on humans. There we aim to
gain inside into mechanistic and functional processes to
identify the molecular basis of the link between fertil-
ity, pregnancy and longevity and their associated single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Kiel University seeks to increase the proportion of fe-
male scientists in research and teaching and therefore
explicitly encourages qualied female academics to ap-
ply. Priority is given to women who have equal attitude
and professional performance.

PhD position in comparative neurogenetics and be-

We are looking for a PhD candidate (earliest start-
ing date: 01/01/2020) to develop a project in compar-
ative neuroscience and behaviour in the lab of Prof.
Richard Benton (www.unil.ch/cig/benton) under the
co-supervision of Dr. Thomas Auer at the Center for
Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Switzer-
land.
The candidate will develop his/her project within the
larger lab topic of behavioural evolution using the
chemosensory system of the closely-related Drosophila
species D. melanogaster and D. sechellia. These ies
show opposing behaviours upon exposure to hexanoic
acid: D. melanogaster is repelled while D. sechellia is at-
tracted. This behavior is highly relevant for the ecology
of D. sechellia, as it lives exclusively on a single host
fruit enriched with up to 40% of hexanoic acid. We are
using a comparative evolutionary approach to decipher
how acid sensing circuits dier between both species.
This involves RNA-sequencing, neurogenetic tool de-
velopment for functional imaging in chemosensory cir-
cuits, genome engineering and behavioural analysis (see
Auer et al., bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/-
10.1101/546507v1 as relevant reference).
Our experiments will answer the fundamental question
of how evolutionary adaptations in the chemosensory
circuits lead to dierential sensing of information at
the periphery and/or how neural circuit connectivity
modies the perception of the sensed information in the26 EvolDir November 1, 2019

neural changes to an animal's behavioral choices and
the occupation of specic ecological niches.

MathematicalBiology
PhD position in Mathematical Biology (3 years)
I am looking for a PhD student to join my research
group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology.
Evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance on plas-
mids
The evolution of antibiotic resistance poses a severe
threat to modern healthcare. Clinically relevant resis-
tance is often encoded on plasmids. Plasmids are extra-
chromosomal DNA elements that can be transmitted
vertically or be transferred horizontally between cells.
The location of resistance genes on plasmids can lead to
special evolutionary dynamics. The aim of the project
is to develop mathematical models for the evolution and
spread of resistance on plasmids. On the mathematical
side, the analysis will mainly be based on branching
process theory, complemented by deterministic ODE
systems and stochastic computer simulations. The posi-
tion is part of a DFG-funded Research Training Group
(RTG) on \Translational Evolutionary Research". The
program brings together 14 research groups from several
institutions to study how insights from evolutionary
biology can be applied to solve problems in medicine,
food production, and wildlife conservation. Projects
are organised in tandems who work on related topics.
The tandem partner of the proposed project is Profes-
sor Tal Dagan (University of Kiel). The student would
hence closely interact with a research group that fo-
cuses on experimental evolution and data analysis. The
ideal student will be one who is interested in applying
mathematical modeling to gain insights into biological
problems and is enthusiastic about math as well as about
biology. The successful student will learn how to set
up and analyse theoretical models to describe biological
processes and become skilled in using branching process
theory as a modeling tool. Applicants should have a
background in mathematics, physics, biology, computer
science or a related eld. Good quantitative skills are
essential. Prior experience in mathematical modeling
and knowledge of a programming language (C, C++,28 EvolDir November 1, 2019
Java, R, Python...) is an advantage.
Working environment
The student will join a young group at the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Biology. In our group, we fo-
cus on exploring the role of stochasticity in evolution. In
the context of resistance evolution, we closely collaborate
with experimental microbiologists at the University of
Kiel. The group is part of the Department of Evolution-
ary Theory. The student will hence be part of a larger
community of researchers working at the intersection
of mathematics and biology with many opportunities
to take part in journal clubs, reading groups etc. The
Max Planck Institute is a lively institute with three de-
partments (Evolutionary Theory, Microbial Population
Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and several additional
research groups. It hosts several workshops per year
and continuously welcomes international short-term and
long-term visitors, creating a stimulating and positive
research environment. We maintain close interactions
with Kiel University and belong to the Kiel Evolution
Center. The area is a center of evolutionary biology in
Germany.
Pl on
Pl on is a small town, embedded into a beautiful land-
scape with innumerous lakes and close to the Baltic
Sea. The area provides ample opportunity for free time
activities such as swimming, canoeing, or biking in a
stunning environment. At the same time, the cities of
Kiel and L ubeck (^ a ¥200,000 inhabitants) are only half
an hour train ride away. Hamburg (Germany's second
largest city) can be reached within 1.5h by train.

MathModelsOfCooperation
Our group explores under which conditions individuals
cooperate. To this end, we translate social interactions
into mathematical games. These games can then be ex-
plored analytically, with computer simulations, and with
behavioral experiments. We are looking for motivated
researchers to join us.
PhD Position (3 years) Mathematical models of cooper-
ation among heterogeneous individuals
One key mechanism for cooperation is reciprocity. Peo-
ple are more likely to help somebody if they have re-
ceived help in the past. Most existing models of reci-
procity assume that all individuals are identical with
respect to their cooperation costs, and in how they dis-
count future interactions. The project aims to develop
and to analyze models of reciprocity among heteroge-
neous individuals.
Applicants should have a degree in mathematics, biol-
ogy, economics, physics, or another related eld. They
should be curious to describe social behaviors mathe-
matically. Ideally, they are already familiar with the
theory of Markov chains and stochastic processes. Good
quantitative skills and interest in programming (e.g.
Matlab, Python, . . . ) will be important.
Working environment The Max Planck Research Group
\Dynamics of Social Behavior" has been established in
October 2019, and is led by Dr. Christian Hilbe. The
group is a part of the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on, Germany. The institute has
three departments (Evolutionary Theory, Microbial Pop-
ulation Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and several ad-
ditional research groups. It hosts several workshops
per year and continuously welcomes international short-
term and long-term visitors, creating a stimulating and
positive research environment. In addition, the research
group maintains strong collaborations with external re-
searchers, including researchers from Harvard University,
IST Austria, and the University of Exeter.November 1, 2019 EvolDir 29
Pl on is a small town close to the Baltic Sea, embedded
into a beautiful landscape with numerous lakes. The
area provides ample opportunity for free time activities
such as swimming, canoeing, or biking in a stunning
environment. The cities of Kiel and L ubeck (^ a ¥200,000
inhabitants) are only half an hour train ride away. Ham-

PlantEvoutionEcologicalGenomics
A PhD position is available to study adaptive intro-
gression in Poplar with Jill Hamilton at North Dakota
State University, as part of a new NSF Plant Genome-funded collaboration with Jason Holliday (Virginia
Tech), Stephen Keller (Vermont) and Matt Fitzpatrick
(U of Maryland).
Understanding how interspecic hybridization leads to
the generation of complex adaptive traits across envi-
ronments is a central objective of species management,
particularly considering rapidly changing climates. Nat-
ural Populus hybrid zones provide a 'living laboratory'
to test the impact a long history of natural selection and
weak barriers to reproduction have had on the origins
of adaptations and the maintenance of species barriers.
The graduate student will leverage replicate natural
hybrid zone transects between Populus trichocarpa and
P. balsamifera spanning the Rocky Mountains in con-
junction with modern sequencing (whole-genome rese-
quencing, long and short reads), large common garden
experiments, and novel computational approaches to
study the genomic and phenotypic consequences of hy-
bridization across environments. Broadly this research
will ask: (i) how is introgression arrayed across the
genome and landscape? and (ii) what regions of the
genome contribute to hybrid tness and what are their
environmental drivers? This project will enhance our
understanding of the relationship between adaptive in-
trogression and tness across environments.
The PhD student will be prepared to combine eld-based
research monitoring phenotypic trait variation across
replicated common garden experiments with genomic
analyses (whole genome resequencing), and environmen-
tal and spatial data. The ideal graduate student will
have some experience in population genomics and/or
quantitative genetics. There is plenty of room to pursue
particular interests in adaptive introgression and the
origin of species barriers depending on the interest and
experience of the candidate. The student will be in-
volved in a range of outreach activities associated with
the project, including engaging with collaborator insti-
tutions and ArbNet (based at the Morton Arboretum,
Chicago) to develop educational modules on climate
adaptation using Poplar mini gardens planted across
the United States. The ability to work independently
and a some background in genetics is needed.

the start date is exible).
Natural selection explains the appearance of design in
the living world. But at what level is this design ex-
pected to manifest 'V gene, individual or group 'V and
what is its function? Social evolution provides a window
on this problem, because it is in the context of social32 EvolDir November 1, 2019
interaction that the interests of genes, individuals and
groups come into conict with each other.
I invite applications for a PhD studentship in my re-
search group at the School of Biology, University of
St Andrews, Scotland, to develop new theory on the
topic of social evolution. The project will suit a Biology
graduate with a strong interest in social evolution, but
applications from graduates with other backgrounds are
also encouraged, and although prior experience in math-
ematical modelling would be helpful this is certainly not
required as the requisite training will be provided.
Current research in my lab involves development of
general theory 'V using kin selection, multilevel selec-
tion, game theory and theoretical population genetics
approaches 'V as well as more specic mathematical
and computer simulation models that are tailored to
the biology of particular organisms, from microbes to
insects to humans. Much of our ongoing work is focused
on intragenomic conicts and associated clinical patholo-
gies, plus the role of sex and gender in social evolution.

If evolutionary biology really fascinates you, and you
are a careful thinker, then you will ourish in the kind
of project that I enjoy supervising.
This studentship is funded by the European Research
Council and the School of Biology at the University
of St Andrews. There are no nationality restrictions

PhD position in Sexual Selection at Stockholm Univer-

APPLICATION DEADLINE: November 5, 2019
Sexual selection and conict
A fully funded 4-year PhD position on the evolution of
sexual selection and sexual conict is available in Pro-
fessor Rhonda Snook's group, Department of Zoology,
Stockholm University.
Sexual selection and sexual conict results in the rapid
(co)evolution of male and female reproductive traits,
such as female remating behavior and male ejaculate
proteins. A long standing question in evolutionary bi-
ology is to understand the genetic basis of such rapid
change. This project aims to address this question by
understanding both coevolutionary dynamics and their
genetic underpinings. This question will be addressed by
investigating the role of sexual conict and sexual coevo-
lution in fruit ies. The project will leverage quantiable
female and male sexually selected traits to uncover their
genetic architecture using Drosophila populations whose
genome is sequenced and assessing natural variation of
focal traits in dierent species. Snook's group has car-
ried out lab-based research on these general questions in
several dierent y species and the project will extend
that work to new traits using new techniques. Research
will involve lab based behavioural and physiological as-
says and quantitative genetics, with the potential for
other approaches such as phylogenetic comparative work
and experimental evolution. The PhD student will be
expected to play a central role in developing the project.
The ideal candidate for this project will have a strong
background in evolutionary ecology and genetics with a
demonstration of capacity for research (including publi-
cations). The PhD student will have opportunities to
learn both general and specic skills required for the
project and opportunities to work with collaborators.
This is an international call. Stockholm University's
Department of Zoology is a vibrant international and
interactive community. Working language in the lab is

TexasAMU EvolutionaryBiology
The Interdisciplinary Degree Program in Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at Texas A&M University
oers a Ph.D. in the eld of Ecology and Evolution. We
oer a world-class training program that incorporates
elds relevant to EEB, spanning evolutionary genomics
to animal behavior to landscape ecology. Our faculty
and students are associated with 11 departments and 7
colleges across Texas A&M University, bringing together
a diverse array of perspectives.The Doctoral Program in
EEB Faculty includes over 60 core faculty members and
approximately 30 associate members, from diverse back-
grounds and a multitude of research interests. In our
Program, students are exposed to an international com-
munity of scholars, allowing them to explore dierent
perspectives in the eld of Ecology and Evolution. Our
faculty's primary goal is to guide students on their jour-
ney to research independence, and they are committed
to excellence in education and science.
Texas A&M University is a long-established research uni-
versity with a 21st century research infrastructure. As
the country's best-funded land- grant university, Texas
A&M possesses an ample and eective life-sciences re-
search infrastructure. EEB doctoral students have ac-
cess to core facilities for genomics, molecular biology,
stable isotopes, and microscopy. They may also take
advantage of the world-renowned herbarium, insect col-
lection, and vertebrate collection, as well as the network
of aliated experimental stations around Texas and the
world. Our high-performance computing resources and
GIS labs enable cutting edge research at all scales.
An important part of graduate training involves inter-
acting and participating in the scientic community.
Our faculty guides EEB doctoral students as they de-
velop into productive members of the research commu-
nity, which starts with a series of EEB core courses,
ranging from physiological ecology to evolutionary ge-
nomics, taught by experts in each eld. Additionally,
rst year students travel to our Mexico research sta-
tion as part of our winter eld course experience. EEB
also oers numerous opportunities for professional and
social interactions. A seminar series permits students
to learn about the latest research and meet scientists
from around the globe. The Journal Club is an oppor-
tunity to discuss scientic articles in relevant disciplines
with peers and faculty. Scientic events, such as thenationally-recognized annual spring Ecological Integra-
tion Symposium and the fall Open Source for Open
Science Workshop provide an excellent opportunity for
professional development. Finally, Texas A&M Univer-
sity has a vibrant campus with numerous opportunities
for social interactions and the EEB Interdisciplinary
Student Organization hosts social events in the fall and
spring to promote integration among students in the life
sciences with EEB interests.
The Doctoral Program in EEB oers ample funding op-
portunities for graduate studies, and students can bene-
t from a full stipend while in the Program. Support
comes from nationally competitive funding packages con-
sisting of teaching assistantships, research fellowships,
and internal merit fellowships. Doctoral students are
eligible for medical insurance and in-state tuition, which
is waived for students with teaching assistantships and
merit fellowships. We encourage you to contact your
prospective mentor about specic options for support.
Applications to the Doctoral Program in EEB should be
submitted by December 9th to ensure full consideration.
Applicants will be evaluated based on their personal
statement, grade point average, TOEFL scores (inter-
national students only), letters of recommendation, as
well as previous research experience. Prospective stu-
dents should indicate which EEB core faculty members
share similar interests. We also encourage prospective
students, as they are putting together their applica-
tion package, to reach out to these faculty members.
Travel grants to visit Texas A&M, meet with the faculty
and graduate students, and explore available resources
and facilities are available to outstanding prospective
students.

Funding for PhD students is available at The University
of Alabama as part of a recently awarded NSF Rules
of Life project: Bumble bee cold tolerance across ele-
vations - From epigenotype to phenotype across space,
time, and levels of biological organization. PhD students
will be involved in studying the links between genomic,
epigenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic variation
in relation to local thermal tolerance adaptation in mon-
tane bumble bees (lozierlab.ua.edu). The project will
involve extensive high throughput sequencing of bees
from wild populations and experimental colonies and
the use of approaches like network theory to model and
draw inferences from these complex data. Students will
develop questions relating to ecological, evolutionary,
or conservation genomics within the broader project
objectives. The focus of the positions is exible, and
we expect there will be a great deal of collaboration
and overlap among students, postdocs, and PIs on the
project.
I am looking to recruit highly motivated students with in-
terests in applying modern molecular and computational
tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions in
a non-model organism. Applicants should have a strong
academic record (GPA >3.0), an ability for clear verbal

PhylogeneticBiogeography
I'm reposting this PhD advert as it is still open. I'd
like to have applications in (at least preliminary appli-
cations, e.g. if a Masters degree is pending you can still
apply) by December 1.
Research Project Introduction
Funded PhD project: Improving model-based inference
in phylogenetic biogeography
A fully-funded PhD scholarship is available at the Uni-
versity of Auckland to work on improving and testing
new models and methods in phylogenetic biogeogra-
phy. Phylogenetic biogeography is the study of how
the geographic ranges of species change over millions
of years. Modern methods are based on probabilistic
models, where the importance of various processes is
statistically inferred from the data, and these inferences
are used to estimate the history of each clade.
Such methods are used in hundreds of studies a year,
and the results of such studies provide information about
how species have evolved in response to plate tectonics
and climate change, and have implications for topics
such as epidemiology and conservation in world with
invasive species and global warming. However, avail-
able methods have many limitations, especially in their
treatment of (1) extinction, (2) fossils, and (3) palaeo-
geography. The PhD student will collaborate with Dr.
Matzke to produce new methods that allow new phylo-
genetic biogeography models to make use of resources
such as the Paleobiology Database and the open-source
plate-tectonics software, GPlates.38 EvolDir November 1, 2019
Conducting this research in New Zealand is especially
attractive, as it has a long history of fascinating debates
about the geographic history of the ora and fauna of
New Zealand and Gondwanaland, so there is a large sci-
entic and public interest in biogeographical questions.
New Zealand also has a long history of being at the
leading edge of statistical phylogenetics. The University
of Auckland has an international reputation, and was
85th worldwide in the 2018/19 QS World University
Rankings.
Research Project Objectives
The detailed plan for the PhD research project will be
developed in collaboration with the student in line with
their specic interests, but the funded project is aimed
at these overall goals:
1. Devise and test new models for inference of biogeo-
graphic history at macroevolutionary timescales
2. Use these models to combine standard, DNA-based
dated phylogenies to data sources such as the Pale-
obiology Database and GPlates to test and improve
inferences
3. Help to develop and teach the resulting software
package
4. Present this work in peer-reviewed publications and
at regional and international meetings
Criteria for successful applicant
Students should have the equivalent of a Masters-level
qualication or the equivalent of a bachelors degree
with honours, and satisfy the English requirement (see
Entry Requirements at: https://www.auckland.ac.nz/-
en/study/study-options/nd-a-study-option/doctor-of-
philosophy-phd.html ). Prior coursework or research
experience in any of these areas will be helpful, but
not required: evolution, phylogenetics, biogeography,
statistics, programming / bioinformatics, Geographic
Information Systems.

UCLouvain MolecularEcolEvolution
We are looking for highly motivated candidates to apply
for a PhD-project in Molecular Ecology and Evolution,
funded through the Fonds National de Recherche Sci-
entique (FNRS -ASPIRANT), in the labs of Profs
Bertanne Visser and Caroline Nieberding (UCLouvain,
Belgium).
All living organisms have the ability for fat synthesis,
with the exception of parasitic wasps that were thought
to have lost and subsequently regained fat synthesis
during their evolution. Recent ndings have revealed,
however, that fat synthesis in these wasps was not lost,
but depends on environmental conditions: when devel-
oping in a fat-poor environment (lean hosts) wasps will
readily synthesize fat; yet when development occurs in a
fat-rich environment (fat hosts) fat synthesis can be shut
o completely. The main aim of this project is to eluci-
date how plastic responses in fat synthesis are regulated.
Using a y-parasitizing wasp, we will rst elucidate the
exact physiological conditions leading to this pheno-
type; and second we will use an ' ^Aomics' ^A approach
(RNA-sequencing, epigenetic marking) to identify the
molecular mechanisms responsible for switching fat syn-
thesis on and o. The work will include maintenance of
and experiments with dierent host and parasitic wasp
populations, eld work, and laboratory work including
various physiological and molecular measures.
The ideal candidate for this position will have a strong
background in evolutionary ecology, skills in molecular
biology and a capacity for creative and critical think-
ing. The PhD student will have opportunities to learn
general and specic skills required for the project and
opportunities to work with collaborators. Applicants
should hold a MSc diploma (120EC) or will nish their
studies before the starting date of the grant, October
1st 2020. Only applicants within the top 15% can apply
successfully for this grant scheme. Applications will be
reviewed until the position is lled.The salary will be around 2000 euro netto per month plus
benets (health insurance,' ^A'), which are included in
the Belgian system. Our University is an Equal Oppor-
tunity/Armative Action Employer, and is in a French-

Disentangling the drivers of life-history evolution in the
wild: Articial selection meets natural selection in a
unique avian island population
Competitively funded PhD position, based at the Centre
for Ecology and Conservation at the Cornwall Campus
of the University of Exeter.
Supervised by Dr Erik Postma (University of Exeter),
and co-supervised by Dr Jon Bridle (University of Bris-
tol), Dr Jinliang Wang (Zoological Society of London),
Prof Marcel Visser and Prof Arie van Noordwijk (Nether-
lands Institute of Ecology)
* Project background *
Despite a large body of theory describing how genetic
variation and selection shape adaptive evolution, the-
oretical predictions often appear to be at odds with
what we observe in real-world populations. Although
the apparent ubiquity of so-called evolutionary stasis
(i.e. selection and heritability but no evolution) has
triggered many attempts to rene our predictions by
incorporating the complexities that are typical of wild
populations, this crucially assumes that evolution is in
essence predictable. However, is natural selection strong
enough to overcome the eects of random drift and geneNovember 1, 2019 EvolDir 41
ow, especially in small populations? Being able to
answer this question is crucial if we are to advance our
understanding of the ability of populations to persist
in a world changing at unprecedented rates, and the
evolutionary process in general.
In this project you will quantify the roles of natural se-
lection, gene ow and drift in shaping the evolutionary
dynamics of clutch size, a key life-history trait. You will
do this by capitalising on i) over 60 years of individual-
based data for an island population of great tits (Parus
major) on the Dutch island of Vlieland, and ii) a unique
eight-year (1996-2003) experiment that combined strong
articial selection on clutch size with cross-fostering and
clutch size manipulations. Integrating life-history, t-
ness and pedigree data from before, during and after
the experiment will provide you with an exceptional
opportunity to study life-history evolution in action,
and to quantify the importance of natural selection,
gene ow and drift. Thereby you will provide an insight
into the evolutionary dynamics of wild populations in
general, and their capacity to respond to natural and
human-induced selective pressures. To this end, you will
use state-of-the-art statistical/quantitative genetic ap-
proaches to infer the role of genes and the environment
in shaping variation in clutch size and tness, and the
relationship between them. These will be complemented
by individual-based simulations and molecular marker
data to quantify the role of stochastic processes, includ-
ing drift. This project capitalises on a uniquely rich and
powerful dataset that allows for answering a wide range
of questions, and you are encouraged to further develop
the project according to your interests.

Resistance Evolution in Response to Emerging Wildlife
Disease Competitively funded PhD position, based at
the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at the Cornwall
Campus of the University of Exeter, UK. Supervised
by Dr Barbara Tschirren (University of Exeter, UK),
and co-supervised by Dr Sarah Perkins (Cardi Uni-
versity, UK), Dr Patricia Brekke (Zoological Society of
London, UK), and Dr Lars Raberg (Lund University,
Sweden) * Project background * Climate change drives
the emergence of human and wildlife diseases. In Eu-
rope, the disease vector Ixodes ricinus (Sheep tick) is
currently undergoing a range expansion to higher lat-
itudes and elevations in response to climate warming.
As a consequence, host populations that were previ-
ously disease-free have become exposed to ticks and
tick-transmitted pathogens. This natural experiment of-
fers the unique opportunity to track resistance evolution
in action in natural host populations. The most com-
mon tick-transmitted pathogen in Europe is Borrelia
afzelii, which infects humans and causes Lyme disease.
However, the pathogen's natural hosts are small mam-
mals such as the bank vole Myodes glareolus. Bank vole
populations can be easily tracked in space and time, pro-
viding an excellent model system in which to test how
disease and resistance evolve under climate change, and
its ramications for human and wildlife health. The aim
of this project is to understand how resistance evolves in
bank vole populations in response to Borrelia emergence,
and why and how variation in Borrelia resistance is main-
tained within and across populations. You will address
these questions by combining eld sampling of bank vole
populations across gradients of Borrelia infection risk in
Sweden and the United Kingdom with state-of-the-art
molecular laboratory techniques. Population genomics
approaches will be used to track resistance evolution
in action in newly exposed host populations. Further-
more, in-vitro immunological assays and patterns of
gene expression in resistant and susceptible voles will be
used to understand the mechanisms underlying Borrelia
resistance, and the maintenance of its variation, in the
wild. This integrative and multidisciplinary approach
allows you to address a wide range of questions and you
are encouraged to further develop the project according
to your interests. The project includes secondments
to Lund University, Sweden and the Zoological Soci-42 EvolDir November 1, 2019

GenomicsAdaptiveDierentiation
PhD position in biology, Institute of Life and Envi-
ronmental Sciences, University of Iceland A full PhD
position in biology is open for applications, at the Insti-
tute of Life and Environmental Sciences for the project:
The genomic basis of adaptive dierentiation between
closely related morphs of Arctic charr
To what extent do loci with moderate to large eects
on phenotype contribute to adaptive dierentiation be-
tween ecotypes of Arctic charr specialising on foraging
for dierent prey types in dierent environments within
Thingvallavatn? Are loci related to adaptive dierentia-
tion xed, or do they cause variation both between and
within morphs? Are there evidence of positive selection
in the genome? Do genomic regions with signatures
of selection also associate with phenotype? These and
related questions will be addressed by a team of re-
searchers, and a capable Ph.D. student responding to
this advertisement. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)
of Lake Thingvallavatn are ideally suited for studies of
the ecology and genetics of adaptive diversication: i) it
is an extraordinarily well-characterised system, ii) it has
young evolutionary history, iii) it has diverged into four
morphs with distinct variation in life history character-
istics, behaviour and trophic morphology, suggesting
rapid adaptive diversication. This system thus repre-
sents an extremely compelling case of rapid adaptive
dierentiation. However, to date, the system has been
under-used to answer fundamental questions about the
genetic basis of this diversication, due in large part to
a lag in the development of genomic resources, and the
long generation time. These issues have recently been
overcome, and it is now possible to get at some long-
outstanding questions. The overall aim of this project is
to answer fundamental questions about the genetic basis
of this extraordinary case of rapid adaptive dierentia-
tion, by determining the number, genomic distribution,
range of eect sizes on traits and evidence of selection
of loci contributing to adaptive diversication. We will
answer these questions by deploying a series of studies,
using both classical genetic study designs (QTL map-
ping) of carefully constructed laboratory crosses, and
modern population genomic analyses of eld-collected
specimens.
We are seeking a student with dedication, drive andgood theoretical background in evolution, ecology, popu-
lation genomics and quantitative genetics. The position
will be at the University of Iceland. The project is in
collaboration with Michael B. Morrissey at the univer-
sity of St Andrews, Scotland and Moira M Ferguson
at the university of Guelph (Canada). The work will
be divided between the universities of Iceland, St. An-
drews and Guelph. The PhD study should be completed
within four years of full time study. The PhD-student
may be involved in teaching, for two semesters maxi-
mum. Applications should be submitted here: https:/-
/english.hi.is/vacancies accompanied by i) a letter of
intent (maximum two pages) explaining interest in work-
ing on this project, the reason to pursue a PhD, hopes to
gain and learn during the PhD studies and what makes
them suitable for this project ii) CV, iii) transcripts of
university diplomas, courses taken at bachelor and mas-
ters level, iv) degree project thesis and vi) names and
contact information of two persons that could provide
letters of references. Applications should be sent before
October 31st 2019, to kalina@hi.is
The student will join the Arctic charr group at the In-
stitute of Life and Environmental Sciences. The Arctic
charr group consists of several PhD students and senior
personnel, and has collaborators in Iceland, Scotland
and Canada. The combined expertise covers population
ecology and genetics, molecular and developmental biol-

UmeaU EvolutionEndosymbiosis
PhD modeling endosymbiosis at Ume ~A ¥University
\A Ph.D. studentship in mathematics as related to mod-
eling the evolution of endosymbiosis and the evolution-
ary origins of eukaryotes is available in the research
group of Eric Libby at Ume ~A ¥University in Sweden
(http://ericlibby.github.io/). Candidates should have
a quantitative background with an interest in building
mathematical models of biological systems. The pro-
posed work will feature interdisciplinary projects done
in collaboration with Chris Kempes at the Santa Fe
Institute.
Background for the project: A pivotal event for the
evolution of life on earth was the endosymbiotic event in
which two previously independent cells merged to give
rise to what we now call mitochondria and eukaryotes.
This event is thought to have occurred only once and ac-
count for the evolution of all large, complex life. Despite
its importance, we do not understand the general princi-
ples that govern the probability or tness consequences
of an endosymbiotic event. The aim of this Swedish
Research Council-funded PhD position is to address this
signicant knowledge gap by developing a theoretical
framework based on mathematical models that can iden-
tify these principles. Useful modeling techniques include
dierential equations, network approaches, agent-based
simulations, evolutionary analyses, probabilistic models,
and allometric scaling analyses.
Qualications: Candidates need to be skilled in both
oral and written communication in English, and should
be able to work independently as well as in collaboration
with others. Certain coursework is needed in mathe-
matics (contact Eric or see job posting for detailed
information). Candidates need to have prociency, but
not necessarily documented, in working with comput-
ers and programming, e.g. in Matlab, Python, Julia,C&#43;&#43;, or some other language. A good back-
ground in mathematics, dierential equations, and/or
programming is qualifying. Interest and knowledge of
evolutionary biology, microbiology, and/or molecular
biology is desirable but not necessary.

UNottingham EvolutionOfMimicry
The evolution of mimicry in a changing world: how
shifting bumblebee communities aect selection on a
colour-polymorphic hovery
Applicants are invited for a fully-funded PhD stu-
dentship at the University of Nottingham (UK), in col-
laboration with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
starting Sep/Oct 2020.
Link: http://www.envision-dtp.org/2019/the-
evolution-of-mimicry-in-a-changing-world-how-shifting-
bumblebee-communities-aect-selection-on-a-colour-
polymorphic-hovery/ Complex species interactions
make the impacts of global environmental change
dicult to foresee. Understanding the ecological and
evolutionary relationships between species, and the
way that the tness of a species is aected by changes
in community composition, is essential in order to
predict shifts in species distributions and patterns
of biodiversity. In this project, we will investigate a
fascinating interaction between an important group
of pollinators and their charismatic parasite, with
the ultimate aim of predicting the consequences of
environmental change for the species concerned. Along
the way, we will gain some valuable insights into
the genetic origins of Batesian mimicry. The project
involves an unusual combination of practical ecology
and behaviour, species distribution modelling, and
cutting-edge genomics.
Larvae of the hovery Volucella bombylans infest the
nests of bumblebees. They eat bumblebee brood cells,
pollen stores and detritus, but the impact on host t-
ness, and hence the degree of parasitism, is not known.48 EvolDir November 1, 2019
Adult ies display a striking colour polymorphism, with
individuals resembling dierent bumblebee species. We
think they are Batesian mimics, fooling predators into
thinking that palatable and harmless ies are heavily-
defended and unpalatable. In the era of species distri-
bution modelling and genome sequencing, this system
provides unique opportunities to address two fascinating
research questions. Firstly, how will global environmen-
tal change aect the relationship between a putative
parasite and its hosts, when those hosts also act as
a model for mimicry? And secondly, which genes are
responsible for Batesian mimicry, and how is selection
on those genes inuenced by variation in community
composition?
The successful applicant will conduct eld sampling,
laboratory experiments, genomic analysis and species
distribution modelling, with the focus of the work being
shaped by the student's interests. They will work with a
cross-disciplinary supervisory team, and receive training
in entomology, bioinformatics and modelling.

USheeld EvolutionaryGenomics
We are seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD
student to study the evolution and genetics of sexual
dimorphism across birds.
*The evolution and genetics of sexual dimorphism*
Deadline for applying: 8th January 2020
Lead supervisor: Dr Alison Wright, University of
Sheeld Co-supervisors: Prof Jon Slate (University of
Sheeld), Prof Steve Paterson (University of Liverpool)
*Details* Males and females of the same species are
often subject to very dierent selection pressures and
can show major dierences in morphology, behaviour
and life history. However, as there are very few sex-
limited genes, these contradictory selection pressures
act on a genome that is identical between the sexes.
This can generate sexual conict, an evolutionary tug-of-war between males and females. On the one hand,
this tug-of-war is thought to act as an evolutionary
brake. However, there is growing evidence that sexual
conict might actually accelerate adaptation by increas-
ing genetic diversity in populations. Disentangling the
causes and consequences of sexual conict is a major
challenge in evolutionary biology, with important impli-
cations for our understanding of adaptation and sexual
dimorphism.
This project will test the causes and consequences of
sexual conict across the genome using next-generation
sequencing data from multiple bird species. The spe-
cic approach taken can be tailored to the particular
interests of the student and could include studies of
gene expression, alternative splicing, adaptation, sexual
selection and genome evolution. Applicants should have
strong analytical skills and an enthusiasm for evolu-
tionary genomics. Bioinformatic skill are preferred but
certainly not essential.
*Training * This PhD project is an excellent opportu-
nity to learn state-of-the-art genomic skills to study
genome evolution and test clear theoretical predictions.
The successful candidate will be trained in cutting-edge
bioinformatics and genomic techniques. The applicant
will be joining a positive and collaborative research
group and benet from the diverse range of expertise
oered by the co-supervisors and researchers within the
Animal and Plant Sciences Department at the University
of Sheeld.
*Funding Notes* Interested applicants are encour-
aged to contact Alison Wright before applying
(a.e.wright@sheeld.ac.uk) for more details on the
project, funding and facilities. For details on current
research in the Wright lab, see www.alisonewright.co.uk

of understorey plants in relation to forest management.
Common-garden experiments and a large transplant ex-
periment are core to this project. The student will be
supervised by Niek Scheepens (Plant Evolutionary Ecol-
ogy) and Pieter De Frenne (Ghent University, Belgium).
In the project ForGenDiv, the PhD student (m/f/d)
will sequence material of 20 plant and arthropod species
from the forest understorey and link these data to for-
est management. The student will be responsible for
sampling all material as well as for molecular lab work
and statistical analyses. This project will be supervisedby Henri Thomassen (Comparative Zoology) and Oliver
Bossdorf (Plant Evolutionary Ecology).
The two projects will collaborate during sampling as well
as through joint data analysis. Both projects are part of
the Biodiversity Exploratories, one of the largest ecology
projects in the world, which will allow the students to
interact with many other ecological researchers.
The successful applicants will be based in T ubingen.
The eld work will take place across Germany in the
Swabian Alb, Hainich-Duen and Schorfheide-Chorin re-
gions. The University of Tuebingen is one of the oldest
universities in Germany, and Tuebingen is a beautiful
university town with a high quality of life. The Plant
Evolutionary Ecology group and the Comparative Zool-
ogy group study the ecology, evolution and genomics of
plants and animals in changing environments.
We are looking for students with strong interests in
ecology and evolutionary biology. The successful candi-
dates should have a MSc in biology (or equivalent), solid
statistical skills (preferably in R), a good command of
English, and a driving license (German or otherwise).

is a plus for ForGenDiv. Both positions are funded for
3 years (pending nal conrmation by the DFG). Salary
is at the scale 13 TV-L (65%). Starting date is 1 March
2020.
The University of Tuebingen aims at increasing the share
of women in research and teaching and therefore partic-
ularly encourages women to apply. Disabled candidates
will be given preference over other equally qualied
applicants.
If you wish to apply, please send your CV, along with a

Panama, beginning in mid-January 2020. The position
is open to all students with a background in zoology
and interest in animal behaviour or neurobiology.
Heliconius butteries exhibit a marked expansion of the
mushroom body, a region of the insect brain associated
with learning and memory, being 3-4 times larger than
in other Lepidoptera, including closely related Heliconi-
ini genera. The EBAB Lab is investigating both the
developmental basis and behavioural consequences of
this expansion through developmental timeseries of neu-
ral tissue and behavioural experimentation across both
Heliconius and non-Heliconius Heliconiini species.
The primary responsibilities of the eld assistant will
be to maintain stock buttery populations and rear
caterpillars. There will also be opportunities to collect74 EvolDir November 1, 2019
wild butteries from surrounding forests, assist with be-
havioural experiments on long-term memory and learn
to perform insect brain dissections and lab protocols for
next-generation sequencing approaches. This is an excel-
lent opportunity for a recent graduate to gain experience
in lab work, experimental design and eld collecting.
Dates: starting and nishing dates are exible, but ide-
ally the successful candidate will be available for three
months, beginning in mid-January 2020.
Funding: the successful applicant will receive 800 USD
per month, which comfortably covers living costs while
in Panama. STRI requires that all researchers have
health insurance, this is not provided but can be pur-
chased through STRI at the applicant's cost. Financial
assistance with air travel to and from Panama will be
available if required.
Accommodation: application can be made for accommo-
dation through STRI or arranged privately. Accommo-
dation costs are approximately 250-300 USD per month.
Gamboa is a small town, with all facilities within com-
fortable walking distance.
Interested applicants should have training in zoology or
a related eld, and should send a CV and brief state-
ment of research interests to Fletcher Young (etcher-
jyoung@gmail.com) and Laura Hebberecht (lauraheb-

DAMBE Update
Dear Colleagues,
I have uploaded a new version of DAMBE (7.2) to
http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/DAMBE/dambe.aspx 1.
Almost all alignment functions are now done with the
included MAFFT and MUSCLE (with authors' per-
mission), except for the pairwise alignment in the
PhyPA function (Phylogenetics from pairwise align-
ment, Xia 2016, MPE) which includes codon-based align-
ment not available in MAFFT and MUSCLE. However,
DAMBE allows you to do quasi-codon-based alignment
in MAFFT/MUSCLE. After you open a set of codon
sequences, click 'Alignment jMAFFT' or 'Alignment
jMUSCLE' and choose 'Align as codon seq.' (default
if the input sequences are protein-coding sequences).
This function is in fact available and described in detail
in Xia (2000. Data analysis in molecular biology and
evolution. Kluwer). It is behind the scene in three steps:
1) translate sequences into AA sequences, 2) align AA
sequences, 3) map codon sequences to aligned AA se-
quences. DAMBE reminds users to cite the original
MAFFT/MUSCLE references.
2. If you have 1000 les, each with a set of homologous
sequences, you call click all the les and DAMBE will
align them one le at a time with either MAFFT or
MUSCLE. Most functions in DAMBE has a multi-le
option.
3. For evaluate the quality of multiple sequence align-
ment (MSA) from various methods including manual
alignment/renement, a typical measure is the summa-
tion of all pairwise alignment scores (without counting
shared gaps). This function you can access by clicking
'Alignment jEvaluate a multiple alignment'. If you have
aligned 1000 les with both MAFFT and MUSCLE and
wish to see which one generates better MSA, you can
use this function to generation 1000 multiple alignment
scores from the 1000 les aligned by MAFFT and an-
other 1000 multiple alignment scores from the 1000 les
aligned by MUSCLE, and then choose MSA with higher
scores.
4. After aligning your 1000 les, DAMBE can assemble
them into a supermatrix with a few clicks. For example,94 EvolDir November 1, 2019
if you are interested in the phylogeny of 100 species,
and some of your 1000 les may contain only a sub-
set of these 100 species. The common practice is to
concatenate all these 1000 les into a supermatrix.
5. I have added a new function for choosing the best
outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. It is based on three
criteria: distance-based, parsimony-based and PWM-
based (position weight matrix-based). The best out-
group should increase the resolution of the deep phy-
logeny (the deep part of the phylogeny)
6. I have replaced most of the internal likelihood-based
phylogenetic methods by the included PhyML (with au-
thor's permission). The phylogenetic tree is graphically
shown. You may click 'Tree jRe-root tree' to re-root
the tree. The nodes are then numbered. You click any
numbered node to re-root the tree.
7. This replacement with PhyML also aects an old
ProtML function accessed by clicking 'Phylogenetics j
Maximum likelihood jProtML for highly diverged se-
quences'. What the function does is simply recode the
20 amino acids into four groups (LargePolar, SmallPo-
lar, LargeNonpolar, SmallNonpolar). This allows the
nucleotide-based phylogenetic methods to be applied to
amino acids. This function has been in DAMBE for a
long time, but I see its value only very recently when
I dealt with truly highly diverged protein sequences.
It helps to resolve relationship among deep nodes, but
the shallow part of the resulting phylogeny is poor as
one would expect given that many phylogenetic signals
become ambiguous after the recoding. It is somewhat
equivalent to recoding nucleotide sequences to two cat-
egories (purine and pyrimidine). It does seem to help
with the deep part of the tree. This ProtML function
simply recoding the AA sequences and then let PhyML
to do the \nucleotide"-based phylogenetic analysis. You
will see that the Polar-nonPolar replacement rate is
typically lower than the Large-Small replacement rate
(equivalent to transversion and transition).
8. Several people asked about the function of degenerat-
ing codon sequences to avoid composition bias and other
phylogenetic signal bias. For example, if homologous
sequences A, B, C have UUA, CUU, and UUU at the
same site. The rst two codons are Leu codons, but
the third is a Phe codon. Thus, for this site, sequences
A and B should be most similar to each other, but the
two codons dier by one transition and one transver-
sion. In contrast, the second and third codons, albeit
nonsynonymous, dier by only a single transition. Af-
ter codon degeneration, the three codons become YUN,
YUN and UUY, so the rst two synonymous codons
are identical and both dier somewhat from the third
nonsynonymous codon. Another degeneration protocolis to degenerate the three codons to CUN, YUR, and
UUY which has some advantage over the

that will garner attention. The deadline for submission
is June 30th, 2020 but early submissions are encouraged
and will be published as they come.
If you are interested in contributing or if you have ideas
for possible projects and collaborations please reach out

exchange rates is about $1400.
Special Issue Abstract: Methods traditionally used for
biodiversity assessments are increasingly being supple-
mented by DNA-based approaches. Sequencing of envi-
ronmental DNA (eDNA) or of DNA from mixed bulk
samples such as plankton tows, benthic communities,
and gut contents is rapidly growing in popularity as a
tool for ecological studies and community assessments.
Using these tools, it is increasingly possible to assess
and track community-level biodiversity patterns from
a single sample, enabling rapid, cost-eective compar-
isons of biodiversity across trophic levels, in contrasting
habitats, and over time. While metabarcoding has pre-
dominantly been used to track species occurrences, a
number of recent studies have demonstrated a corre-
lation between species biomass (or density) and DNANovember 1, 2019 EvolDir 95
concentration, suggesting that these approaches may,
in the future, be developed to reliably quantify species
abundance. The purpose of this Special Issue is to ex-
plore the uses of eDNA and metabarcoding in marine
systems. We welcome articles that both demonstrate, as
well as challenge, the utility of this emerging tool. We
strongly encourage methological papers that empirically
test protocols and provide new resources for the larger
community. We also look forward to receiving articles
that use metabarcoding to address questions in ecology,
biogeography and conservation in novel ways.

During the challenge, The Coordinators will generate
synthetic data mimicking an ASF-like epidemic at the
interface between pig farms and wild boars in a typical
European context. On a monthly basis, these data will
be given to the challenging modelling teams (The Play-
ers) while the epidemic develops. Players objectives is
to reproduce the observed epidemic assuming a set of
intervention strategies, predict its expansion for the next
four weeks and prioritize a nite number of alternativeinterventions. Any kind of model can be used. Note
that previous modelling challenges have demonstrated
that, in some situations, simple statistical models can
be more useful than complex mechanistic models!
Above everything, this challenge is expected be fun and
provide an inspiring platform to exchange knowledge
and expertise on animal health modelling at the inter-
face between livestock and wildlife. It will also be a
nice opportunity to publish a special issue in a high-
impact journal on our collective experience and results
obtained.
Coordinators are P. Ezanno (INRA, Oniris, Nantes,
France), S. Picault (INRA, Oniris, Nantes, France), and
T. Vergne (INRA, ENVT, Toulouse, France), greatly
supported by a group of experts including E. Gilot-
Fromont (VetAgroSup, Lyon, France), E. Baubet, S.
Rossi & E. Marboutin (ONCFS, France), and C. Belloc
(Oniris, Nantes, France), who have expertise on ASF
epidemiology, ASF regulated control in livestock, and
ASF regulated control in wildlife.
We are counting on you!

Epistasis Species Assemblages
dear and reputable members of the evoldir,
i would like to kindly ask you for indications about
publications and informal precedents pertinent to the
possibility that the non-narrow-sense phenotypic vari-
ance may be exploited by NS and shape ecology and
evolution in equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations.
This may be more likely when this variance is large, but
competitive exclusion, e.g., can be decided by subtle
dierences.
m.r.rose's 1980s lab experiments conrmed that at equi-
librium the narrow-sense variance in tness is quickly
exhausted and only the non-narrow-sense \epistatic" one
remains in quantities (plus developmental noise).
The distribution of non-narrow-heritable phenotypic
variation can be made adaptively 1-tailed by modi-96 EvolDir November 1, 2019
ers promoted through evolution by natural selection
(EbNS).
As a side eect the modied distribution would also
boost the demographic persistence and competitive abil-
ity of eukaryotic species.
But when say a competitive exclusion contest is won by
a species' top performers even the non-modied distri-
bution may be consequential.
The distribution of non-narrow-heritable traits can be
made adaptive also by reformulating the epistatic ge-
netic variation underlying the distribution.
Modiers may suppress (canalize) the non-favorable tail
of the distribution and others may augment the favor-
able tail. A tail-suppression modier would invade if it
increases ceteris paribus the viability and/or fecundity
of individuals whose non-narrow-heritable genotypes
otherwise result in inferior phenotypes.
Strangely perhaps, the modiers would only be favor-
able if they land in individuals with the right epistatic
endowment and would be fully straightjacketed to (\con-
ditional to") their species' syndromes of epistatic varia-
tion, possibly to the point of being deleterious if crossed
into the syndromes of other species.
Paradoxically, once evolved the 1-tailedness would let
a random set of \spiteful" individuals with enhanced
phenotypes be generated each generation that deny en-
ergy and resources to competing con-specics and other
species but whose \tness with EbNS consequences"
would be of no interest EbNS-wise because their pheno-
types are not narrow-heritable.
Additionally, the enhanced individuals are likely to pro-
duce more progeny maternally possibly better supplied,
reducing so the species' probability of extinction by
demographic stochasticity, increasing its reproductive
capacity, etc.
All in all, the enhanced individuals would put inter-
specic competitors at a disadvantage as a superior
asexual competitor would.
Furthermore, when species dier in their epistatic dis-
tributions these dierences are narrow-heritable since
they \breed true" as species persist through time, across
generations or through overlapping generations.
NS can let species with adaptive distributions become
over-represented within species assemblages, specially
when inter-specic competition, displacements of species
into refugia, and competitive exclusion are chronic, e.g.,
when new species relentlessly invade species assemblages.
It may be illuminating to distinguish between distribu-
tions that increase in frequency because the individualsconstituting them appropriate individually or as groups
energy+resources that would be otherwise go to other
individuals or groups, intra- and/or inter-specically.
This may suggest ways to start bridging the gaps be-
tween focussing on the fates of genes and gene coalitions
vs.the trophic causation of events.
Adaptation to say changing environments may often
include reshaping the distributions of non-narrow heri-
table phenotypes by re-orchestrating the modiers that
repress and augment the tails of these distributions and
reformulating their underlying epistatic variation.
Even the steady-state population genetics of eukaryotic
species in general (polymorphism maintenance?) and
their genetic-load dynamics in particular, may be a lot
about re-constituting each generation each species' syn-
drome of non-narrow-heritable phenotypic variation, to
counter its disruption by mutation, genetic drift, and
selection.
It would be surprising if EbNS is actually unable to
exploit the substantial amounts of non-narrow-heritable
phenotypic variation that are typical of eukaryotic
species and must dier quanti- and quali-tatively be-
tween species.
Thanks a lot in advance for your indications about rele-
vant literature and informal communications as well as
for any feedback you may wish to share.
And of course, everything i receive will be shared back
with evoldir unless you request otherwise.
best

Paraguay TropicalEcolResIntern
*Tropical Ecology Research Intern*
Organization: Para La Tierra (www.paralatierra.org)
Location: Pilar, Paraguay
Time Frame: Rolling Applications
Para La Tierra is searching for talented and hardwork-98 EvolDir November 1, 2019
ing research interns to join our team in Paraguay for 3
to 6 months. Our internship program provides young bi-
ologists an opportunity to step out of the classroom and
into the eld, gaining hands-on experience running a re-
search project of their own design. Before arriving, our
interns are challenged to come up with a research topic,
review the relevant literature, and create a methodol-
ogy with the support of our intern-supervisor. Once
in-country, interns are trained in the eld techniques
required for their project. Whether its mist-netting for
birds in the early hours of the morning, shing at mid-
day or staying out late hunting for frogs, PLT will make
sure that our interns are condent in the methodology
needed to move their research forward. Towards the
end of the stay, all our interns give a nal presentation
in which they share the results of their study with the
rest of the research team. The internship program is
designed to give young scientists the opportunity to
take control of every step of a scientic project. From
conception to completion, our interns are in the driver
seat.
*When was the last time that your professor gave you
the option to choose what you wanted to study? When
was the last time your boss told you to follow your own
passion? *
At Para La Tierra, we specialize in training young biolo-
gists in the skills they need to enter further education or
the job market. Based in Paraguay, the 'heart of South
America,' we are the country's only year-round research
station. Over the past 9 years, we have published over 60
peer-reviewed articles and discovered a few new species
for science. Along the way, over 250 interns have helped
contribute to the better understanding of Paraguay's
understudied habitats.
Our research base is located in the city of Pilar, a beauti-
ful location in the south of Paraguay, and the gateway to
the~Aeembuc ~AoWetland Complex (NWC). The NWC
is composed of a mosaic of habitats, including grass-
lands, marches and humid Chaco. Deep forests lining
the rivers and streams running through the area are
bursting with wildlife, while river monsters the size of
small cars lurk in the murky waters.
*Come discover for yourself what Paraguay has to oer.*
Our interns nish the program taking away a long list
of newly learned skills, a professional reference, and one
heck of an experience to share at their next interview.
But they also leave behind a great deal. All of our
intern projects are directly involved in conserving this
threatened habitat. The scientic investigations of the
area help raise awareness of the ecological importance of
~Aeembucu at both the national and international levels.
The most successful projects are published in scienticjournals, further raising the prole of Paraguay, and
many interns make their way onto the author line for
the rst time in their early careers through their work
with Para La Tierra.
The application period is rolling and there are no start
or end dates, so the trip can be organized to suit the
project and the person. Interns must be available to
stay for a minimum of three months.
Applicants must be over 18 years old and have or be
working towards a degree in a biology related subject.
Conversational English is required. To apply please
email your CV to paralatierra.py@gmail.com.
*Costs* - Because the best things in life aren't free.
$925 per month for the 1st 2 months and $875 for each
subsequent month.
Para La Tierra charges interns to cover costs of room
and board. The price includes all living costs during
their stay with us. Interns receive three meals a day,
a bed in shared accommodation with hot showers and
access to WiFi. The fee also covers the use of PLT's
scientic equipment, minor administrative costs associ-
ated with the stay, and a small contribution to Para La
Tierra's conservation and education projects.
Weekly basis pro rata payments are accepted in special
cases. There is a 25% discount for South American
nationals.

RNASeq vs TagSeq answers
Hello,
We have received some very interesting responses to
our problem regarding RNA-Seq vs. Tag-Seq. Just in
case someone might be interested, here are all responses.
Thanks to everyone for all their help,
Lucia
Original question Hello all,
My name is Lucia and I am a Biology PhD student from
University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. For my thesis I
am exploring the changes the bacteria Wolbachia pip-
ientis induces in the weevil Pantomorus postfasciatus
in order to make infected females parthenogenetic. We
know there is a bacterial density threshold necessary to
cause such a radical change in the weevil's reproductive
system and one of my objectives is to identify dier-November 1, 2019 EvolDir 99
entially expressed genes in ovarian tissue from sexual
females, infected females and \cured" females (females
treated with antibiotics to reduce the bacterial density
below the threshold) in order to shed some light on how
Wolbachia aects the reproductive system of infected
weevils.
Two paths lay ahead of me: standard RNASeq or
TagSeq. From what I have been reading, TagSeq is a
low-cost but still reliable alternative (Meyer et. al., 2011
Vdoi: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05205.xV; Lohman et.
al., 2016V doi: 10.1111/1755-0998.12529V; and Matz,
2018Vdoi: 10.1016/j.tig.2017.11.002V), the problem is
that I do not know anyone who has personally used it
so I am cautious.
On the other hand, there are two main issues to take
into consideration upon making this decision. Firstly,
the weevils cannot be bred in laboratory conditions and
are quite hard to nd in the wild, therefore, the amount
of RNA that will be available is still unknown and I
will need to make at least 3 replicates. Also, funding
is incredible low: in a year the price of an American
dollar has gone from 23 Argentinian pesos to 60 which
means our ability to pay (in US dollars) for the libraries
and sequencing has plummeted and that situation is not
likely to change in the near future.
From this transpires the fact that we will to maximize
the RNA extracted per ovary (on that topic I have
found this protocol based on Matz (2002) and would
be very grateful for your thoughts about it: http:/-
/evrogen.com/technologies/RNA-isolation.shtml), but
the minimum amount of RNA per sample will also be
important in choosing which method to use: for RNAseq
we will need at least 500 ng of RNA per sample while
for TagSeq protocols, some companies can go as low as
needing 10 ng of RNA per sample.
What do you think about the two methods? Is one
truly better or worthier than the other for detecting
dierential gene expression? What would your approach
be if you were in my shoes?
Thank you all in advance! I am willing to post all
replies...

Responses Hi Lucia, We did tag-seq a bunch of years
ago when it emerged with the rst Illumina sequencing
platforms. We found a lot (and I mean a lot) of \appar-
ent" anti-sense transcripts. Now, yes, there probably
is more anti-sense transcription that we might think(I know the human cancer geneticists got interested in
it; not sure if still are), but not this much. Illumina
stopped supporting it, and I wonder if there were issues
that they never admitted to. If you can, I would use
RNA-seq. I hope this is helpful. Best, Dave
Hi Lucia, It sounds an interesting project that
you have. The following page is very help-
ful in understanding the pros and cons of TAG
seq: https://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/faqs/-
when-do-you-recommend-3-tag-rna-seq/ In your case,
there is no genome available for even a species in the
same genus, which will be problematic. Also, you may
be interested in splice variants, but the rst issue is
the biggest reason that TAG seq may not be the best
for you. I hope the funding/economic situation gets
better there. I was planning to come to Argentina for
sabbatical Spring 2021, to Bariloche, but I am waiting
to see given the current situation. Good luck with your
project. All the best, Ben
Hi Lucia, This is paper we have on BioRxive regarding
our approach to do RNAseq for very cheap: https:/-
/www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/585810v1 .There's
also a pipeline to process the data, and a protocol to ex-
tract your RNA that works for very small input material
(e.g. single y head). https://lufpa.github.io/TM3Seq-
Pipeline/ I developed it for my experiments where I
have to sequence thousands of Drosophila melanogaster
heads (tiny tiny heads) and get RNA and DNA from
single heads. Take a look at it, it might help you. I'm
also happy to answer any questions you might have.
Cheers, Luisa

ClemsonU OralMicrobeEvolution
Clemson.OralMicrobeEvolution
Vincent Richards' lab in the Department of Biological
Sciences at Clemson University is accepting applications
for a post-doctoral position.
The overarching research theme will focus on the dental
microbiome and the relationship between the bacterial
and fungal components of this community. Specic
questions include how these taxa respond and adapt to
this dynamic environment. Operating over numerous
time scales, multiple host factors such as diet, health,
disease, and host genotype can impact the oral envi-
ronment and hence are strong evolutionary forces that
can shape and select for changes within the commu-
nity. We are particularly interested in the interplay and
co-evolution of bacterial and fungal components of the
community and how these processes are impacted by
immunosuppression. Multiple omic approaches such as
comparative genomics, metagenomics, and metatran-
scriptomics will be coupled with network analyses to
address these questions.
Similar projects focusing on the oral microbiome in gen-
eral are possible and the postdoc will be free to explore
and lead such projects. The postdoc will take a se-
nior position within the laboratory and contribute to
the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate research.
The candidate should have a strong publication record
and a background in microbial community dynamics.
Ideally, the candidate should have experience analyz-
ing next-generation sequence data and be versed in
Linux/bash. Although desirable, experience with metra-
transcriptomics and network analyses are not required.
The successful applicant will be trained in multiple
bioinformatic approaches.
The position is available immediately and review of ap-
plications will continue until the position is lled. Up to
four years of support are available (with the possibility
for extension). The salary is $50,000/year plus benets.
Applicants should contact Vincent Richards directly at
vpricha@clemson.edu. Please provide a cover letter (de-
scribing research interests, experience, and career goals),
a CV that includes links to authored publications, and
contact information for three references.Clemson University is ranked 27th among national pub-

Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science
and Technology, is a Swiss-based and internationally
networked aquatic research institute within the ETH
Domain (Swiss Federal Institute of Science and Technol-
ogy). It is committed to the ecologically, economically
and socially responsible management of water resources
and aquatic ecosystems.
The Department of Fish Ecology and Evolution (FishEc)
located in Kastanienbaum (Lucerne) has s vacancy for
a Postdoctoral Researcher in Evolutionary Ecosystems
Ecology Applications are sought from individuals with
research experience in ecology and evolution. Appli-
cants should have an earned doctorate (or expect to
nish their PhD early 2020) in a relevant eld of bi-
ology, ecology, or environmental science and a strong
interest in sh evolutionary ecology, life history, popula-
tion structure and food webs. Skills in stage-structured
and/or ecosystem modelling is especially benecial for
the position.
The postdoctoral researcher will be associated with the
Eawag-funded project \Drivers of biomass distributions
in aquatic food webs along anthropogenic gradients".
With this project, we will investigate the correlates and
drivers of biomass distribution in contrasting food webs
that can be arranged along gradients of energy availabil-
ity, biotic richness and disturbance. We will specically
focus on the role of nutrients, community structure and
evolutionary processes, such as evolution of alternative
migratory forms, ecotype formation and adaptive radia-
tion and investigate eects of anthropogenic inuence
on biomass distribution via its eects on evolutionarydiversity. Specically, we will focus on lake- and stream
food webs in Southern Greenland and The European
Alps, with additional work on systems in Scandinavia
and East Africa. The position includes a eld trip to
Southern Greenland in the summer 2020.
This is a 24 months postdoctoral position. The
position will be hosted by the River Fish Ecology
group (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/shec/-
main-focus/river-sh-ecology/) and the FishEc Depart-
ment (http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/shec/).
The project includes collaboration between research
groups of Jakob Brodersen, Ole Seehausen, Carlos
Melian and Blake Matthews. We aim to do funda-
mental research on sh ecology and diversity in order to
answer current and future applied questions regarding
conservation of sh diversity in Swiss lake/river systems.
We are aiming at hiring people with complementary
skills, who are able to collaborate and take advantage of
synergies between research disciplines to produce novel
synthesis. Excellent communication and writing skills
in English and ability to work in a team are essential.
The work place is at Eawag's Center for Ecology, Evo-
lution and Biogeochemistry (CEEB) in Kastanienbaum,
Lucerne, which besides the Fish Ecology and Evolution
Department hosts research groups from the Department
Surface Waters - Research & Management and oers
a beautiful workplace at the shores of Lake Lucerne, a
friendly international working climate and a strong cross-
disciplinary research environment. Both departments
within CEEB share a common interest in understanding
the principles of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems
and their susceptibility and adaptability to changing
environments, and a common concern for sustainable
management of ecosystems and biodiversity. Each de-
partment on its own aims at contributing cutting edge
science to the development of theory in ecology, evo-
lution and environmental sciences. Building on the
synergies that emerge between these elds, the CEEB
aspires to contribute to a future synthesis of evolutionary
biology and ecosystem science.

Dear evoldir members, Post-doc opportunity in Lisbon
(Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci^ encia)
(Current deadline: 31/10/2019 to be extended to
31/12/2019),
we are looking for an enthusiastic post-doc interested in
the use of genetic and genomic data to reconstruct the
demographic history of species. The candidate will work
on questions related to endangered species (with a fo-
cus on Madagascar), human evolution or domestication.
The questions we ask are related to the importance of
population structure (connectivity, habitat fragmenta-
tion) and genomic diversity: how do ancient climatic
events inuence the genome of present-day species? Can
we dierentiate between the genomic signature of popu-
lation size changes and changes in connectivity? Should
we represent recent human evolution as changes in con-
nectivity or changes in population size change? These
are some of the questions that we try to ask within
the DISPO project (Demographic Inference in Struc-
tured Populations). Our group has been working on
the concept of IICR (inverse instantaneous coalescence
rate, Mazet et al., 2016 Heredity), which can be used
to address these questions. The candidate will thus
learn to use the IICR but could or better should bring
his/her own experience to make progress in these issues.
Enthusiasm and critical mind are crucial.

ModellingReciprocity
Our group explores under which conditions individuals
cooperate. To this end, we translate social interactions
into mathematical games. These games can then be
explored analytically, with computer simulations, and
with behavioral experiments.
We are looking for motivated researchers to join us.
Post Doc Position (2 years) Modeling reciprocity in
changing environments
Typical models of reciprocity assume that individuals
interact in the very same game over and over again. In
such setups, already simple strategies like \Tit-for-Tat"
suce to enforce cooperation. However, in many nat-
ural applications, such as the management of natural
resources, individual actions today can alter the entire
strategic situation in future rounds. Such scenarios with
environmental feedback can be described by stochastic
games. The project aims to characterize how environ-
mental feedback aects cooperation, and what strategies
the individuals adopt.
Applicants should have a strong quantitative back-ground; ideally they already have experience in using
classical or evolutionary game theory to analyze social
behavior. The position requires a sound mathematical
background, programming skills (Matlab, Python,. . . ),
and experience in scientic writing. Experience with
behavioral experiments is an advantage, but not neces-
sary.
Working environment The Max Planck Research Group
\Dynamics of Social Behavior" has been established in
October 2019, and is led by Dr. Christian Hilbe. The
group is a part of the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on, Germany. The institute has
three departments (Evolutionary Theory, Microbial Pop-
ulation Biology, Evolutionary Genetics) and several ad-
ditional research groups. It hosts several workshops
per year and continuously welcomes international short-
term and long-term visitors, creating a stimulating and
positive research environment. In addition, the research
group maintains strong collaborations with external re-
searchers, including researchers from Harvard University,
IST Austria, and the University of Exeter.
Pl on is a small town close to the Baltic Sea, embedded
into a beautiful landscape with numerous lakes. The
area provides ample opportunity for free time activities
such as swimming, canoeing, or biking in a stunning
environment. The cities of Kiel and L ubeck (^ a ¥200,000
inhabitants) are only half an hour train ride away. Ham-
burg (Germany's second largest city) can be reached
within 1.5h by train.

EvolutionaryGenomics
The Hiller Lab at the Max Planck Institute in Dres-
den, Germany, is looking for an ambitious Postdoc to
work on comparative genomic analysis of bats and other
mammals.
Project description: The postdoc will utilize publicly-
available genomes of numerous mammals as well as
newly-sequenced genomes of several bats to discover the
genomic basis of interesting phenotypic dierences be-
tween these species. The postdoc will apply and further
develop our genomics methods, and analyze results by
integrating biomedical knowledge and generated func-
tional genomics data. Promising candidate genes will be
tested experimentally, either by the Postdoc or in col-
laboration. Funding is according to the German TV oD
scale and available for at least 3 years.
Our Lab: We combine computational biology, com-
parative genomics and experiments to investigate how
nature's fascinating phenotypic diversity evolved and
how it is encoded in the genome. On the computational
side, we align and annotate genome assemblies [1-3],
develop and apply comparative genomic methods to dis-
cover key dierences in genes and regulatory elements
[4-9], and use statistical approaches to associate genomic
to phenotypic dierences [10,11]. On the experimental
side, we use RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, functional assays and
CRISPR-Cas9 to reveal the molecular function of ge-
nomic regions and to test causality between genomic
and phenotypic dierences [12,13]. Our group is part
of the Bat1K project (https://bat1k.ucd.ie/members/)
that aims at generating reference-quality genomes of all
bats.
The lab is based at the Max Planck Institute of Molec-
ular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) and we are
jointly aliated with the Max Planck Institute for the
Physics of Complex Systems, both in Dresden. Both
institutes are highly interactive and interdisciplinary
workplaces, provide an international atmosphere with
English as working language and access to cutting-edge
computational and experimental infrastructure and fa-
cilities. The MPI-CBG was awarded one of the \Best
Places To Work for Postdocs" in 2011.Requirements: Applicants should have a strong publi-
cation record and a degree in bioinformatics / compu-
tational biology, genomics or a related area. Excellent
programming skills in a Linux environment as well as
experience with shell scripting and Unix tools are re-
quired. Previous experience in large-scale comparative
genomic data analysis is an advantage.
How to apply: If interested, please email (i) your CV
including publication list and contact information for
at least two references and (ii) a summary of previ-
ous research experience (max 1 page) to Michael Hiller
(hiller@mpi-cbg.de). Further information: https://-

fers a Postdoctoral Fellowship in microbial symbiosis,
evolutionary genomics and developmental biology.
Housed in the Max Planck Institute for Developmental
Biology, the Research Group aims to elucidate the molec-
ular basis behind the establishment of host-microbe sym-
bioses, and to describe the developmental proles con-
tributing to their persistence. Contextualized through
our work on leaf beetles and their pectinolytic mutual-
ists, and by leveraging a broad range of methodologies,
our aim is to characterize these partnerships across mul-
tiple biological scales.
OUTLOOK:
Central to our work are the questions of why symbioses
form and how they are maintained. We seek an out-
standing and highly independent candidate to join the
laboratory as a postdoctoral research fellow. The ideal
candidate will apply a combination of computational and
experimental approaches to characterize the molecular
underpinnings behind the establishment of specialized
symbioses in insects. Specically, we are interested in
how symbionts are integrated into their hosts' ^A devel-
opmental cycle, and the regulatory and evolutionary
implications of long-term coevolution between host and
microbe. The candidate is expected to apply her/his ex-
pertise in molecular biology, genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics and/or high-resolution microscopy to for-
mulate hypothesis-driven research and participate in
collaborations with other members of the group.

positionPostDocs.aspx. We seek to complement and
extend our ongoing research eorts with respect to deer
population ecology by addressing the potential impact
of predators (coyotes, bobcats, dogs) on fawn recruit-
ment using samples of predator hair and scat collected
noninvasively from 3 regions of Indiana. We will use
DNA-based approaches to determine donor species, sex,
unique DNA prole and the proportion of predator scat
samples that contain deer DNA. These data will inform
spatial capture-recapture models to estimate predator
density, and possibly occurrence. Opportunities also
exist to estimate coyote abundance via statistical popu-
lation reconstruction using images from >350 camera
traps and coyote age-at-harvest data. Ultimately, data
on predators will be incorporated into integrated pop-
ulation models of deer in the state. The successful
candidate will contribute to both genetic surveillance
and population modeling aspects of the project.
Applicants should possess a Ph.D. before the May

Rosco France
DeepSeaMolluscEvolution
Postdoctoral research position in larval shell biogeochem-
istry and mollusc population genetics at the Rosco
biology station (France).
||||| We are looking for a Postdoctoral Research
Associate to investigate population connectivity in a122 EvolDir November 1, 2019
deep-sea hydrothermal vent gastropod using elemen-
tal ngerprinting, possibly in combination with genetic
analyses.
||||| Population connectivity plays a key role in
the demography and evolution of species with structured
populations, but is generally dicult to estimate. The
diculty is particularly overwhelming when it comes
to estimating population connectivity of deep-sea ma-
rine invertebrates that disperse as tiny and inaccessible
pelagic larvae. For species with calcied structures,
a promising approach is to use elemental ngerprint-
ing (composition of minor and trace elements) to trace
back the origin of larvae, optionally in combination
with population genetics. ||||| The post-doc
will investigate dispersal in the hydrothermal gastropod
Shinkailepas tollmanni (also referred to as Olgasolaris
tollmanni) using elemental ngerprinting of embryos
and young recruits. Before they complete their devel-
opment and disperse, embryos acquire a calcied shell
(protoconch) that incorporates minor elements and trace
elements reective of their natal environment. Since the
protoconch is still present at the apex of the shell of
young recruits after dispersal, an attempt can be made
to identify the natal site of the recruits by comparing
the elemental ngerprint of their larval shell with the
elemental composition expected from potential source
populations (elemental composition of uid emissions
usually dier between localities).
The objectives of elemental ngerprinting are therefore:
1- Establish an elemental composition reference for a
variety of potential source populations. This will be
done by analysing the shell of late-stage encapsulated
embryos (veliger larvae almost ready for release) col-
lected from a number of sites and assessing whether this
elemental composition is site-specic. 2- Determine if
dierences can be detected in the elemental composition
of shell regions that formed before dispersal (apex of
juvenile shell) and after dispersal (edge of newly formed
juvenile shell). 3- Try to assign the natal origin of young
recruits by matching the elemental ngerprints of their
larval shell to the site-specic reference established for
objective 1 above.
||||| At the same time, the post-doc will explore
the feasibility of applying a population genetics approach
based on RAD-sequencing data for larvae, juveniles, and
adults to be compared or combined with results from
elemental ngerprinting. As part of an ongoing PhD
(collaboration with the University of Montpellier2 and
the Banyuls Marine Station, France), adult samples
are currently being analysed by the host team using
this technique. ||||| Samples of encapsulated
embryos, young recruits, and adults were collected from
ca. 20 hydrothermal sites in ve back-arc basins of thewestern Pacic, and are available in the host lab. The
post-doctoral fellow will work with Thierry Comtet and
Thomas Broquet, both CNRS researchers at the Station
Biologique de Rosco with experience in the estimation
of connectivity from elemental ngerprinting (TC) and
population genetics (TB). In addition, the postdoctoral
fellow will collaborate on population genetic analysis
with a doctoral student currently in the laboratory. The
Rosco biological station houses various research groups
(including the DyDiv team) that study the biology of
marine species, from cell cycles, developmental processes
and physiology to species ecology and evolution.
||||| We are seeking a collaborative post-doc asso-
ciate who is interested in research questions related to
larval dispersal. Experience in biogeochemical analysis
of calcied larval structures and/or population genetics
is a pre-requisite to the application. The position is for a
period of two years and is remunerated according to the
CNRS guidelines (net monthly salary ca. 2|000 to 2|
300^A depending on experience). ||||| Interested
applicants should submit their application by e-mail

SouthAfrica StripedMouseReproduc-
tiveCompetition
Postdoc Project: Reproductive Competition and Social-
ity
(Seasonal Unpredictability and Social Flexibility)
We are looking for a highly motivated postdoc to join
the striped mouse project www.stripedmouse.com and
our group at the University of the Witwatersrand (Jo-
hannesburg) to study the inuence of the degree of
reproductive competition on sociality. We have two
South African funding opportunities (one pending, one
call coming up) and decisions about the funding and the
postdoc position will be made before Christmas 2019.
For the project, a long-term dataset on social organisa-
tion of striped mice will be available for analyses (from
2003 to present) and further data collection will extend
to 2021. Sociality (% of solitary versus group-living
striped mice) will be studied in relation to population
density and the intensity of reproductive competition,
which is (i) very high during the spring breeding season
when all females breed, (ii) absent during most summer
dry seasons, (iii) low during summers with unexpectedrains when few females breed (6 out of 17 summers in
the current data set).
Questions and predictions: We expect that reduced re-
productive competition during summer breeding will
lead to more social instability in spring compared to
summer, i.e. groups to be more stable in summer. We
will also study which factors dier between females that
breed during the summer vs. females that don't. Fi-
nally, the impact of rare summer breeding on population
dynamics will be studied.
Key requirements: Strong statistical skills. Good un-
derstanding of social evolution. Strong CV with 3 pub-
lications from the PhD and at least 1 publication per
year from postdoc studies, some of them in high rank-
ing journals (impact factor >3). Willingness to spend
considerable time in the eld in South Africa. Ability
to analyse data and to write manuscripts while being
eld based.
What you will learn: Strong eld skills. The postdoc
will spend considerable time in the eld. It is expected
that the postdoc will prepare and start analysing the
database while being based at the Succulent Karoo Re-
search Station in South Africa www.stripedmouse.com

job&rmjob=10173&rmlang=UK Closing date:
November 5, 2019Project description: The position is associated with a
project on characterising an enigmatic marine endosym-
biosis in the genus Meringosphaera. Meringosphaera
are single-celled eukaryotes that are globally distributed
and are considered photosynthetic based on consistent
observations of autouorescent 'green bodies' and ab-
sence of feeding behaviours. The autouorescent bodies,
however, have not been veried as true chloroplasts by
ultra-structure or genetic analysis. In fact, no molecular
data is available for Meringosphaera. The overarching
goals of this two year postdoctoral project are to char-
acterize the genetic integration and metabolic function
of the photosynthesizing bodies of Meringosphaera. A
suite of single cell methods wil be employed including
halogenated in situ-hybridization (HISH)-secondary ion
mass spectromtey (HISH-SIMS), ow activated sort-
ing (FACs) for single cell genome and transcriptome
sequencing, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
The position is a collaborative project between the lab-
oratories of Rachel A Foster from SU and Fabien Burki
from UU.
Main responsibilities: The position involves sampling,
imaging by CLSM, and attempts for cultivation of
Meringosphaera cells in enrichment cultures. Additon-
ally, managing the sample preparations for FACS, single
cell sequencing, and implementation of stable isotope
experiments and preparing and overseeing samples for
nanoSIMS analyses. Training will be provided when
necessary.
Qualication requirements: Postdoctoral positions are
appointed primarily for purposes of research. Appli-
cants are expected to hold a Swedish doctoral degree
or an equivalent degree from another country. The se-
lected candidate must possess expertise and knowledge
in microbial sampling as well as identifying and han-
dling small eukaryotic plankton. Experience in culturing
of microbial eukaryotes with background in eukaryotic
diversity and photosymbiosis will be seen as highly valu-
able. A suite of methodologies will be used in the
proposed work and hence the following skills are desir-
able: use of basic and/or advanced microscopy platforms
(epi-uorescence, CLSM), use and or understanding of
FACS, basic molecular based assays including kit based
assays (e.g. nucleic acid extractions, PCRs, genome am-
plication kits), library preparations for bar-coding, and
genome analysis. Previous experience with stable iso-
topes, and in eld expeditions (e.g. ocean-going cruises)
are also good qualications but not necessary. The can-
didate should be interested, motivated and exible to
move between the labs of Foster (SU) and Burki (UU)
as experiments will be carried out at both locations.
Candidates must be uent in English.
Assessment criteria: The PhD degree should have been130 EvolDir November 1, 2019
completed no more than three years before the deadline
for applications. An older degree may be acceptable
under special circumstances, which may involve sick
leave, parental leave, clinical attachment, elected posi-
tions in trade unions, or similar. In the appointment
process, special attention will be given to documented
research skills as described in the qualication require-
ments (e.g. assay development, cultivation, work with
single celled eukaryotes, various above mentioned single
cell methods), and publication history.
Terms of employment: The position involves full-time
employment for a maximum of two years, with the pos-
sibility of extension under special circumstances. Start
date as soon as possible, and no later than 2019-12-31.

TempleU ModelingInvasiveSpecies
The Integrative Ecology Lab at Temple University is
seeking creative and productive applicants for a post-
doctoral researcher conducting mathematical modeling
of invasive spotted lanterny (Lycorma delicatula) pop-
ulation dynamics. The spotted lanterny is an invasive
Asian planthopper that was rst introduced to the US
outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2014, and has
since spread to ve nearby states. In addition to natural
spread, human-assisted lanterny spread occurs during
all life stages: adults and nymphs hitchhike on cars and
it can spread long distances in the egg stage because
it lays eggs on mobile outdoor objects like recreational
vehicles and landscaping materials. It feeds on over 70
plant species, sometimes at very high densities, includ-
ing economically important species like maples, apples,
hops, and grapes. Invaded vineyards have lost entire
crops, aecting wine production. We are just begin-
ning to model its pattern of spread and potential to
disrupt agricultural and natural ecosystems. Billions of
dollars are under threat. You can be at the forefront of
cross-disciplinary modeling research on this emerging
invasion.
The position will be co-advised by Matthew Helmus
(Biology) and Benjamin Seibold (Math) at Temple Uni-
versity. Helmus jointly runs the Integrative Ecology
Lab (iEcoLab) with the mission to integrate biodiver-
sity science with human ecology to understand con-
temporary patterns of biodiversity and its function-
ing within ecosystems (https://www.iecolab.org/). Sei-
bold directs the Center for Computational Mathematics
and Modeling (C2M2) on cross-disciplinary research
in applied and computational mathematics ( https://-
c2m2.cst.temple.edu/). To read more about their spot-
ted lanterny research see https://www.iecolab.org/-
projects/spotted-lanterny/. The postdoc would work
closely with two other postdocs and two graduate stu-
dents also working on spotted lanterny at Temple. Fi-nally, the postdoc would interact with a USDA funded
multi-university team of cross-disciplinary scientists and
public stakeholders and would regularly attend working
groups and meetings on this invasive pest.
Expertise in mathematical modeling, partial dieren-
tial equations, numerical methods, and programming is
required. Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Biology,
Mathematics, Physics, or other related elds. Most im-
portantly, the successful applicant will be well-organized,
able to work both independently and in a team setting,
and motivated to learn. This position is ideal for those
craving a career in the exciting, fast-paced world of
biodiversity science. Applications should be emailed

The post
We are looking to appoint a full time Postdoctoral Re-
search Fellow to conduct research on host-pathogen
interactions working with Wellcome Trust Sir Henry
Dale research fellow Dr Ben Longdon, at the University
of Exeter, Penryn campus.
This post is available on a xed term basis for two years
with the possibility to extend.
About the role
Host-parasite interactions oer fascinating opportunities
to study coevolution, local adaptation and rapid evolu-
tionary change. Our work uses a unique experimental
system of up to 50 species of Drosophila and naturally
occurring RNA viruses to ask fundamental questions
about pathogen host shifts - where a pathogen jumps
from one host species to another. Host shifts are a
major source of emerging infectious diseases, with HIV,
Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus having all jumped
into humans from other host species.136 EvolDir November 1, 2019
By taking a comparative approach, with a strong set
of hypotheses from ecological and evolutionary theory,
we can provide insights into the factors underlying host
shifts that will be generally applicable to any group of
hosts or viruses. Understanding pathogen host shifts is
critical, especially in light of environmental change.
Our model system has provided key insights into host
shifts, namely the importance of genetic similarity be-
tween hosts. Based on work in Drosophila melanogaster,
we know the interactions between host antiviral immu-
nity and the ability of the virus to supress this immune
response, can play a role in explaining dierences in
susceptibility.
The initial aim of the postdoc is to examine why viruses
can infect some hosts and not others by looking at how
the viral suppressor of immunity functions in dierent
host species, and how this inuences patterns of suscep-
tibility across the host phylogeny, but there are many
opportunities to develop new projects to explore the
ecology and evolution of pathogen host shifts.

The Peterson lab (http://www.plantbio.uga.edu/-
directory/people/megan-peterson) is joining the Plant
Biology Department at the University of Georgia and
will be seeking applicants for a postdoc in plant popula-
tion biology.
All populations must cope in one way or another with
variable and unpredictable environments. Wild popu-
lations are also now experiencing rapid environmental
change, altering selective environments and further chal-
lenging their persistence. The Peterson lab combines
experiments, long-term observational data, and models
to investigate the evolutionary and demographic pro-
cesses that determine how populations persist under
variable conditions and how they can adapt to novel en-
vironments. The postdoc will have the opportunity
to contribute to long-term research in demographic
and phenological responses of arctic/alpine plants to
climate change (http://meganlpeterson.weebly.com/-
research.html) as well as to develop new projects in
collaboration with the PI and other lab members and
collaborators. Potential areas of research include: 1)
the role of local adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity
in shaping species' responses to climate change, 2) the
demographic consequences of advancing phenology and
changing plant-pollinator interactions, and 3) incorpo-
rating evolutionary potential into forecasts of species'
range shifts.
The ideal candidate will have broad training and in-
terests in plant population biology, including expertise
in both eld/greenhouse experiments as well as with
quantitative analysis and modeling methods. Desired
skills include: programming and statistical analysis in
R (generalized linear models, mixed and hierarchical
models), experience with demographic data collection
and modeling (PVA, matrix models, IPMs, stochastic
demography), and experience in one or more of the fol-
lowing areas: pollination biology, distribution modeling,
and/or genomics.
The position is available starting as soon as spring 2020
with a exible start date (summer or fall 2020), and
competitive salary and benets. The University of
Georgia has a large and highly interactive group of
plant biologists and evolutionary ecologists (https:/-

EvolutionaryGeneticsPlasticity
Position as a postdoctoral researcher in evolutionary
ecology and genetics at the Department of Ecology and
Genetics at Uppsala University, Sweden. The project
will be carried out in the research groups of Dr. David
Berger and Prof. G oran Arnqvist at the Animal Ecology
program.
Project description: We are interested in understanding
the evolution of niche width and adaptive phenotypic
plasticity in gene expression with specic application
to insect host use and colonization. Potential projects
include (but are not limited to):
(i) Species vary widely in their use of resources. When it
comes to host use, some species are specialists, narrowly
exploiting only but a few very similar hosts, and some
are generalists and able to use a wide repertoire of hosts,
often diering in both chemistry and the microecolog-
ical niche they provide. What drives and limits such
adaptation? The aim is to get a better understanding
of the possibilities and limitations to host use and niche
evolution by comparing phenotypic plasticity in gene
expression among related species of bruchid beetles that
dier in their host plant repertoire (i.e. \comparative
genomics").November 1, 2019 EvolDir 141
(ii) Some pest species have rapidly been able to colo-
nize new hosts, with sometimes knock-on eects in the
ecosystem and substantial economic costs for agricul-
ture. What is the molecular genetic basis for such rapid
adaptation? Another aim of the project is to study rapid
genetic changes and divergence in phenotypic plasticity
in gene expression in response to host use in the seed
beetle Acanthoscelides obtectus. This will be done by
comparing plasticity in ancestral populations and long
term experimental evolution lines specialized to a novel
host.
(iii) What is the functional molecular genetic basis of
adaptive changes in digestive enzymes?
(iv) How does phenotypic plasticity and genetic adap-
tation to hosts aect reponses to other environmental
factors?
The detailed and nal research plan will be developed in
collaboration with the successful candidate and tailored
to match her/his individual interests and strengths.
Qualications required: The successful candidate must
have a PhD, or an exam which is judged comparable
to a PhD, in evolutionary ecology or molecular biol-
ogy/genetics. In the former case, a documented expe-
rience using molecular tools and analyses of genomic
data is requested. In the latter case, a serious and
documented interest in ecology and/or evolutionary bi-
ology is requested. Candidates must be able to express
themselves with high prociency in spoken as well as
written English. To be eligible the candidate must have
a PhD degree, or a foreign degree equivalent to this,
completed less than three years before the application
deadline. The three year period can be extended due to
circumstances such as sick leave, parental leave, duties
in labour unions, etc.
Qualications desired: We seek candidates with a docu-
mented expertise in acquiring, managing and analysing
genomic data. Experience of tackling problems relating
to the evolution of niche width and phenotypic plasticity
is a strong merit. Because the holder of this position
will collaborate and interact closely with several group
members, we will put emphasis on both independence
and ability to collaborate. Experience with analyses
tools and programming language suitable for treatments
of genomic data is desirable.
Working environment: Our labs are part of the De-
partment of Ecology and Genetics (IEG) (http://-
www.ieg.uu.se/animal-ecology/) that excels in many
aspects of ecology, genetics and evolution and oers an
inspiring and vibrant international atmosphere. The

Dear colleague
We are currently collecting Expressions of Interest
for our Empowering agricultural research through
(meta)genomics series. The (brackets) means we treat
eukaryotic genomics and prokaryotic genomics equally
:-)
Previously held at the Bangkok campus of the pres-
tigious Kasetsart University, Empowering agricultural
research through (meta)genomics will now rotate to
another country that touches the Pacic ocean, with
Vietnam as one nominated location.
We try to be dierent: * This advanced workshop fol-
lows our unique format of combining wet- laboratory
techniques with scientic exploration and bioinformat-
ics analysis. * We value networking and professional
skill development. We include a Research Seminar day
participants can request to submit an oral or poster
presentation. * We also stream biologists and bioinfor-
maticians so they can learn with their peers and focus
on furthering their own expertise. * Our main role is not
to teach but facilitate bring world experts (established
or emerging) from Asia Pacic and work together with
the local culture. * We are passionate about equity
(nationality, gender, and career stage) and are striving
to make a change in our region. * We are all unpaid
volunteers so the costs are kept minimal.
In 2019, about 35% and 45.9% of our teachers and stu-
dents respectively identied as female and I hope wecan do much better next time. Of the joint student and
teacher pool, about 18% identied as a minority in their
country of residence and 70% where either students or
post-docs up to 5 years out of their PhD.
Are you interested in attending as a student or becom-
ing a teacher? Then please register your Expression of
Interest here: https://forms.gle/c5khWV7SgPhzuaYE6
Please complete the form by the 10th of October. It's
free and short!
You can nominate topics of interest and maybe we can
even organise an event at your home country.
You can see information for the previous workshop here:

have become increasingly popular to identify associ-
ations between genetic risk factors and phenotypic
traits.This introductory course is addressed to medical
students, social scientists and biologists without formal
training in the eld. The aim of the course is to provide
a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. In addition
to the illustration of the standard GWAS process, we
will also show how to perform functional enrichment
and apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis in order
to provide individuallevel scores of genetic risk.A mix
of theoretical background and handson experience
will walk students through a series of increasingly
complex data manipulation and visualization tasks.
These exercises will be based on PLINK, PRSice,
and R, among others, which are commonly used,
freely available software tools that are accessible for
novice users.This course is organized by Transmitting
Science.Please feel free to distribute this informationbetween your colleagues if you consider it appropriate.

Dear all,
this December we will run two courses at the Free Uni-
versity (FU) Berlin (Germany), that might be of your
interest:
1) 5-day course on Data Visualization in-depth (9-13
December): https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-
workshops/course54/ In this week-long course, you will
learn how to design visualisations such as charts, maps
and interactive graphics, which bring insight and un-
derstanding to your audience. You will learn about
perception, the design process and the tools that you
can use to make visualising easy. The course is highly
interactive with group exercises throughout. There will
be two versions: for those who wish to practice some
coding, for example with R, and for those who wish to
work on paper throughout. In the last two days, partic-
ipants in their groups will carry out a larger \project",
where we present real-life data with a brieng from a
researcher. The challenge will be to produce some visu-
alisations and pitch them to the researcher on the last
day, with feedback on your project work.
2) 3-day course on RMarkdown (9-11 December):
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course57/ This course is designed for academics and
graduate students with an interest in reproducible
research using Rmarkdown. We will cover all of the im-
portant techniques for generating elegant, reproducible
documents in a wide variety of formats. A strong
emphasis on hands-on exercises means that attendees
will get ample opportunities to generate their own
documents and gain experience of producing advanced
and sophisticated documents using Rmarkdown.

course49/ )
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
When: 2-6 March 2020
General Topic: Bioinformatics pipeline for GWAS anal-
ysis
Instructors: 1) Dr. Filippo Biscarini (CNR, Italy); 2) Dr.
Oscar Gonz alez-Recio (INIA, Spain); 3) Dr. Christian
Werner (University of Edinburgh, UK)
OVERVIEW
This course will introduce students, researchers and
professionals to the steps needed to build an analysis
pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
The course will describe all the necessary steps in-
volved in a typical GWAS study, which will then be
used to build a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics
pipeline.
FORMAT
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include introductory lectures with class discus-
sions of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, results will
be interpreted and discussed in group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at students, researchers and profes-
sionals interested in learning the dierent steps involved
in a GWAS study using them to build a structured
pipeline for semi-automated and reproducibile GWAS
analyses. It will include information useful for both
beginners and more advanced users. We will start by
introducing general concepts of GWAS and bioinfor-
matics pipeline building, progressively describing all
steps and putting there seamlessy together in a generalworkow. Attendees should have a background in biol-
ogy, specically genetics; previous exposure to GWAS
experiments would also be benecial. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
R, Linux command line and custom software. Some
basic understanding of R programming and Unix will be
advantageous. Attendees should also have some basic
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments.

Berlin LandscapeGenomics
Nov25-29 LastCall
Dear all,
we have the last places left on our Landscape Genomics
(3rd edition) in Berlin (Free University (FU) Berlin -
Gemany) this November (25th-29th ).
Application deadline is: October 20th, 2019. Attendees
are seated on a rst-come, rst-served basis.
INSTRUCTORS :
1) Dr. St ephane Joost (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
2) Oliver Selmoni, MSc (Lab of Geographic Information
Systems (LASIG), EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland)
Course overview
The course will provide an overview of the type of dataset
that can be used for a landscape genomics analysis.
It is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, geneticists, veteri-
narians that want to implement the landscape genomics
approach in their own studies of evolutionary biology
and conservation. Even though the course is not in-
tended for a specialized audience, basic knowledge in
evolutionary biology and population genetics would help.
Students will learn how to use GIS, but basic computer
skills are desirable (e.g. in the R environment). A basic
understanding of statistics is also necessary.

Dear all,
we have the last 4 places left on our 5-day
course \RNA-seq Analyses in non-model organisms":
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course2/curriculum2/ )
Where: Free University (FU) Berlin (Germany)
When: 11-15 November 2019
Instructors: Dr. Nicolas Delhomme and Bastian
Schithaler (Umea Plant Science Center, Sweden)
Course overview:
This course provides an overview of modern applica-
tions of transcriptome sequencing and popular tools and
algorithms for exploring transcript reconstruction and
expression analysis in a genome-free manner, leveraging
the Trinity software and analysis framework. Attendees
will perform quality assessment of Illumina RNA-Seq
data, assemble a transcriptome using, among others,
Trinity, quantify transcript expression, leverage Biocon-
ductor tools for dierential expression analysis, and
apply Trinotate to functionally annotate transcripts. In
parallel to the short-read assembly, participants will
perform the pre-processing of 3rd generation sequenc-
ing data (PacBio IsoSeq) and the resulting assemblies
will be compared. Additional methods will then be ex-
plored for characterizing the assembled transcriptome
and revealing biological ndings.
Intended audience
This course is aimed primarily at biologist researchers
that have basic bioinformatics skills and are pursuing
RNA-Seq projects in non-model organisms. Attendees
will gain skills needed to successfully approach tran-
scriptome sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly,
expression analysis, and functional annotation as applied
to organisms lacking a high quality reference genome
sequence. Attendees are also invited to bring a subset
of their own data.
Teaching format
The course will be delivered over the course of four
and a half days, with each session entailing lectures
followed by practical hands-on sessions. Most comput-
ing will be done on the cloud and attendees will use
their own laptop computers with the Google Chrome150 EvolDir November 1, 2019
web browser providing all the necessary interfaces to
the cloud computing environment, including the linux
command terminal. Attendees can also use the native
terminal emulator of their Operating System (and ssh).
This works natively for Linux, MAC and Windows 10.
For Windows 7 users, installing MobaXTerm would be
recommended.

SLiMEvolutionaryModeling
Jan13-17
Hi all.
First of all, as background: SLiM is a software package
for creating evolutionary models/simulations that are
individual-based and genetically explicit. It is script-
able, exible, fast, and includes an interactive graphical
modeling environment. You can read more about it on
its home page (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
January 13-17, 2020, a ve-day SLiM workshop will
be oered at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY, USA). It
will be hosted by Philipp Messer, of Cornell Univer-
sity. It will be free, and open to participants outside
of the university. HOWEVER, registration is required,
a limited number of seats are available, and priority
will be given to registrants aliated with Cornell. To
apply, please send an email to both Philipp and myself
(messer@cornell.edu, bhaller@mac.com) with the info
below. The deadline for applying is the end of the day
on 22 November (late applicants may be considered if
there is room).
For this workshop, your application email should include:(1) your name, (2) your university or institutional alia-
tion, (3) a link to a research website or similar academic
page, if you have one, (4) a 1-2 sentence description
of your level of experience with SLiM and any other
forward genetic simulation software, if any, (5) a 1-2
sentence summary of why you want to attend the work-
shop (i.e., the connection to your research), and (6) 1-2
sentences about any specic topics within SLiM that
you hope to learn about in the workshop. Note that you
will be responsible for your own lodging and your own
transportation. Please do not apply to the workshop
unless you are suciently serious that you will actually
attend, if accepted. Note that acceptance will likely
be rst-come-rst-served (apart from the priority for
those from the hosting institution), so early application
is advised.
The plan is to cover all the major topics in the SLiM man-
ual, starting with lots of introductory material to get be-
ginners up to speed with SLiM and its associated script-
ing language Eidos, and ending up at advanced topics
like non-Wright-Fisher models, tree-sequence recording,
continuous-space models, and nucleotide-based models.
We won't cover everything in the manual \ that would
be overwhelming!" but we'll try to cover all the big
topics. There will also be time for attendees to work on
their own models with help from me, and we may also
have time to explore some optional side topics that are
of particular interest to those attending each workshop.
The workshops will be taught principally using SLiMgui
on macOS. Every attendee will need their own Mac
laptop, but a limited number of Mac laptops should
be available on-site for those who do not have one. (A
Mac is required to run SLiMgui, which is necessary for
teaching purposes.)
I'm hoping to continue doing workshops in future; if
you would like to invite me to give a workshop at your
institution, please send me an email (o-list).
Cheers,
Benjamin C. Haller Messer Lab Cornell University

Ecological immunology workshop 2020: evolution of
resistance, tolerance & symbionts, 24-28 Aug 2020
We are happy to announce a meeting that we're or-
ganising from 24-28 Aug 2020: Ecological immunology
workshop 2020: resistance, tolerance & symbionts to be
held at Kloster Lehnin, close to Berlin, Germany.
The meeting is the next instalment in a loose series of
workshops on ecological & evolutionary immunology /
insect immunity, that started in 2001 in Sheeld, the
most recent one being in Blossin (close to Berlin) in
2017. These meetings bring together researchers with
dierent backgrounds but with a shared interest in im-
munity and host-microbe interactions with a focus on
insects, and where we encourage the presentation of
unpublished results.
The hallmark of these workshops, is the open atmosphere
fostering free exchange by keeping it an aordable, small
conference ( ~85 participants). The format consists of in-
vited speakers, contributed talks and a dedicated poster
session. Long breaks provide plenty of opportunity for
informal exchange. Past workshops have initiated new
collaborations and ideas focusing on frontier research
that has not been published.
The premises are basic but in a beautiful location con-
ducive to the success of the meeting. We will be located
at a lakeside, which at this time of the year oers great
swimming and canoeing, and a small private bar at theharbour.
Conrmed invited speaker so far: Alex Best (Univer-
sity of Sheeld, UK) Nicholas Buchon (Cornell Univer-
sity, USA) Delphine Destoumieux-Garzon (University of

Course description This course on Landscape Genetics
provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary train-
ing and provides an overview of the eld of landscape
genetics. The course caters to students in basic and
applied ecology, conservation and population genetics,
landscape ecology, evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion biology. A key objective of landscape genetics is to
study how landscape modication and habitat fragmen-
tation aect organism dispersal and gene ow across
the landscape. Landscape genetics requires highly in-
terdisciplinary specialized skills making intensive use of152 EvolDir November 1, 2019
technical population genetic skills and spatial analysis
tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools and remote sensing).
Even when students receive disciplinary training in these
areas, educational programs often lack the necessary
linkage and synthesis among disciplines. This linkage
can only be accomplished after experts from each dis-
cipline work together to develop guiding principles for
this new research area. Landscape Genetics will be
concurrently oered at multiple universities across the
globe, giving students the opportunity to learn from
international experts and work with peers from outside
institutions. For students who are not members of the
participating institutions, we are oering a web-based
online course to reach a broader audience. Each course
meeting will start with a live web-cast lecture (no special
software required) by an expert on the topic that intro-
duces foundations and methods and highlights points for
discussion in local seminar groups. After breaking out
into local course group discussion (including a discussion
group for online course students), a web-based discussion
across campuses will wrap up the weekly topic. Students
who are unable to make it to live-cast of lectures can
view taped lectures. In addition, students can choose
to participate in an optional lab section using R and/or
interdisciplinary group term projects with web-based
collaboration across institutions. The nal two options
are provided to help students develop analytical skills in
Landscape Genetics. Students who participate in group
projects will have the option of applying to attend a
project synthesis meeting in Toronto Canada in May
13-17 2020 after the IALE North America meetings.

Faculty who would like to add a local section of the
course at their university can register as a group or
multiple students at one institution can register as a
group. For faculty who set up local sections, we would
expect you to set up course credit at your institution,
participate in the course with the students and grade
assignments (we provide answer keys for assignments).
For individual students or students in small groups (
<4) without a local instructor) who need course credit,
you can have your advisor set up an independent study
course at your home institution and turn in specic
assignments during the semester that will be evaluated
by our online instruction team. This can be set up as
pass/fail or grading on A-F scale. It is easiest for us ifyou pick the pass/fail option. In the US system, this
would count as a 2 credit course for the lecture portion,
and students who choose to do all labs or participate in
a group project would receive an additional credit.
You will be invoiced for the course in early January and
can pay by credit card or check.

Poland GeometricMorphometrics
Mar30-Apr3
Dear all,
Physalia-courses in collaboration with the University of
Lodz (Poland) is organising two courses in Poland next
year:
1) Introduction to statistics in R - 13-16 January 2020
- University of Lodz (Poland) - Instructor: Dr. Diego
Fontaneto (CNR, Italy).
This course will introduce scientists and practitioners in-
terested in applying statistical approaches in their daily
routine using R as a working environment. Participants
will be introduced into the mysteries of R and R Studio
while learning how to perform common statistical anal-
yses. After a short introduction on R and its principles,
the focus will be on questions that could be addressed
using common statistical analyses, both for descriptive
statistics and for statistical inference.
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course13/ )
2) 3rd edition Geometric Morphometrics - 30th March-
3rd April 2020 - University of Lodz (Poland) - Instructor:November 1, 2019 EvolDir 153
Dr. Carmelo Fruciano (Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris
(France) )
This course covers the main common practices of mod-
ern geometric morphometrics, including: acquiring data,
analysing it, visualizing and interpreting the results.
This course is aimed at beginners and intermediate
users. In other words, it is aimed at researchers who
intend to use geometric morphometrics or who have
started performing geometric morphometric analyses
but feel they need a more structured background.
The rst two editions of the course have taken place
in Berlin, Germany. The participants to these editions
have been involved in two studies led by the instructor.
The rst of these two studies has been published (Fru-
ciano et al in press - Zoological Joural of the Linnean
Society; ( https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlz069 ))

the Royal Botanic Garden and the University of New
South Wales in Sydney, Australia, from 1 to 10 April
2020. We have secured funding to maintain free regis-
tration and oer some travel support for the 15 partici-
pants. All details are in our event webpage: https://-

*eFLOWER Summer School Down Under* Royal
Botanic Garden Sydney and UNSW, Australia; 1-10
April 2020
We invite applications for the eFLOWER Summer
School Down Under to be held at the Royal Botanic
Garden Sydney and the University of New South Wales(Australia) from 1 to 10 April 2020. The goal of the
eFLOWER Summer School Down Under will be to de-
liver high-quality training in the modern comparative
methods used to study plant macroevolution, while at
the same time oering the students the opportunity to
contribute to future targets of the eFLOWER project.
While the methods are general and applicable to any
group of organisms, all of our empirical datasets will
be drawn from our recent work on owering plants. A
unique feature of this School will be that the students
themselves will participate in the creation of the datasets
(oral traits and fossil calibrations) in our collaborative
database PROTEUS, thereby gaining hands-on expe-
rience of the problems and questions associated with
compiling data and building real-life datasets for compar-
ative analyses. In doing so, we hope to further promote
the rapidly evolving eld of macroevolution among grad-
uate students in plant sciences, while also conveying our
experience in building high-quality datasets.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
