MarineEvolution Postponed
Dear friends and colleagues,
It is with great regret that we must inform you of our
decision to postpone (NOT CANCEL!!) Marine Evolu-
tion 2020. As you will guess, this is due to the various
uncertainties we all face in the current COVID-19 situa-
tion.
At this point, we can only say that our intention is to
postpone the meeting until 2021, probably around the
same time of year. We'll maintain the website (https:/-
/ccmar.ualg.pt/en/page/marine-evolution-2) active and
endeavour to provide more information as soon as we
can in the coming months.
We hope that you and your loved ones are all staying
safe at this time.
With best wishes from the organizing committee,
Gareth Pearson Rita Castilho Regina Cunha Andreia

Dear colleagues and friends,
We write to invite you to the 2020 Virtual
Choanoagellates-and-Friends Meeting to be held May
26/27 via Zoom. This online meeting follows on a long-
running series of international choanoagellate work-
shops and the online format was inspired by the recent
(and very successful) Electronic Symposium on Protis-
tology (https://protist.online/).
Whether you are a major fan of choanoagellate research
or just mildly curious and want to nd out what all the
fuss is about, please join us. There will be something for
everyone { evolutionary cell biology, animal origins, tool
development, microbial ecology, comparative genomics,
biophysics { and special appearances from a number of
\friends," including animals, diverse holozoan protozoa,
*Chlamydomonas*, and even a virus or two. We're a
welcoming community and hope you'll all come join the
science and fun.
Please be sure to register by May 22: https:/-

We had originally planned this conference to be entered
around 5 hubs globally, but are likely to go fully virtual
now, spanning multiple time-zones.
The topic of the conference will be centred around 5
themes: 1. Ecology and evolution of infection and the
environment 2. Ecology and evolution of synthetic or-June 1, 2020 EvolDir 7
ganisms 3. Quantitative impact of spatial structure
4. Cooperation, communication and conict 5. Eco-
evolutionary dynamics in microbial communities

Title: Within person evolution of infectious pathogens
during disease
PI: Felix M. Key
Place: Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin,

Deadline: May 24th 2020
Lab: http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2003543/key-
lab Application webform: http://www.mpiib-
berlin.mpg.de/1912770/application Description:
The human microbiome comprises trillions of bacteria
that generate billions of mutations every day ' an enor-
mous adaptive potential. While poorly understood, com-
mensal bacteria might exploit this adaptive potential to
translocate into new niches of the human microbiome
where they contribute to disease. Using whole-genome
sequencing cultured bacterial isolates from clinical sam-
ples combined with computational inference methods
the project aims to reconstruct the within person evolu-
tion of commensal bacterial species during the initiationand progression of infection, which can provide new
strategies for intervention or treatment.
We are looking for a motivated student to work at the
interface of microbiology (incl. robotic automation)
and computational genetics in our new lab. The ideal

Title: Deep evolutionary history of microbial pathogens
using ancient DNA
PI: Felix M. Key
Place: Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin,
Germany
Deadline: May 24th 2020
Lab: http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2003543/key-

berlin.mpg.de/1912770/application Description:
Uncovering the deep evolutionary history of infectious
microbes intertwined with human prehistory is critical
for our understanding about disease emergence and the
development of successful strategies for prevention and
intervention. Ancient DNA provides a unique resource
that allows to trace the evolution of microbial pathogens
directly back in time. Using ancient DNA and big data
repositories combined with evolutionary inference meth-
ods, the project aims to reconstruct genomes from in-
fectious pathogens thousands of years old, which we
leverage to understand the timing and genetic changes
associated with disease emergence and spread.
We are looking for a motivated student who has a back-
ground in bioinformatics, genetics, computer science,
microbiology, evolutionary biology or neighboring dis-
ciplines. Knowledge in programming (python, bash, R
etc.) as well as high-throughput sequencing is strongly
desired. The interdisciplinary nature of the project re-
quires a keen interest in archaeology, anthropology and
human history.

Krakow OutbreakInsectGenomics
DeadlineSoon
PhD Student position in Population genomics of out-
breaks - deadline for application approaching!
We are seeking a motivated PhD Student to join the
project \Genomics of population outbreaks in an emerg-
ing model system - neutral and adaptive evolution in
the spruce bark beetle", funded by the Polish National
Science Centre (NCN) SONATA BIS grant.
About the project
A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand
which processes shape genetic diversity observed in nat-
ural populations. Classic population genetic theory
provides a solid mathematical framework to study ge-
netic variation and predict ecacy of natural selection
relative to drift in equilibrium conditions, for example
under constant population size. However, the majority
of natural populations often experience large size uc-
tuations that make prediction less straightforward. The
main purpose of this project is to test how extreme uc-
tuations in population size of outbreaking species aect
the dynamics of neutral and adaptive genetic variation.
Many pests experience epidemic outbreaks characterized
by sudden changes in population size, often spanning10 EvolDir June 1, 2020
orders of magnitude. Such outbreaks are known from
ecological studies of closely monitored species of eco-
nomic importance. However, little is known about how
genetic variation changes during outbreak cycles. Specif-
ically, the rate of adaptive evolution during relatively
short periods of large population size remains unknown.
This can be studied in species which experience extreme
uctuations of population size, such as spruce bark bee-
tle (Ips typographus). Spruce bark beetle is the most
destructive pest of Norway spruce forests because under
specic conditions (e.g. storms) populations may out-
break, causing mass mortalities of spruce stands. We
will compare populations of spruce bark beetle that
have experienced frequent, recent outbreaks and popu-
lations that did not experience outbreaks in the recent
past. By combining existing knowledge on biology and
ecology of the species with newly generated, large-scale
genomic data, we will address specic questions about
the relationship between genome-wide variation and uc-
tuating eective population size: How outbreaks aect
species genetic structure? Are adaptations in frequently
outbreaking populations mainly driven by soft sweeps?
How demographic history of the spruce bark beetle and
historical uctuations of eective population size over
time aect current patterns of neutral and adaptive
variation and more.
The PhD student will be working with large, whole
genome resequencing data obtained from several pop-
ulations and >500 individuals. The samples are being
collected and the sequencing is planned for autumn
2020. Thus, the student will be able to work with the
data shortly after he/she starts his/her PhD studies.
The PhD student will analyse whole-genome variation
patterns including dierentiation, divergence and re-
combination rate variation along the spruce bark beetle
genome. The PhD student will also infer spruce bark
beetle's demographic history using coalescent-based sim-
ulations. The PhD student will gain a wide range of
scientic experience including genome-wide sequence
data analysis as well as demographic history modelling
and will be encouraged to develop his/hers own projects
using extensive datasets available.
About the place and salary
The student will be based at one of the top research in-
stitutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolution in Central
Europe - Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiel-
lonian University, Krakow, Poland ( www.eko.uj.edu.pl/-
enGB). Krakow is a beautiful city with a dynamic cul-
tural life (European City of Culture 2000; more than 100
festivals and other events organized every year; modern
museums, cinemas, theaters, restaurants etc). It has
good access to outdoor activities (biking, hiking and
more) and is well-connected to the rest of Europe.The PhD student will be supported by a 48-month,
tax-free research stipend: 4500 PLN ( ~1050 EUR) per
month. This stipend may be combined with the stan-
dard PhD program scholarship (for those that will pass
the entrance exam to PhD graduate school at Institute
of Environmental Sciences, approximately 2200 - 3500
PLN). Note that in Poland, the living costs are rela-
tively low (check out a cost-of-living calculator such as
www.numbeo.com) and even without additional funding
from graduate school the salary is more than enough to
fully enjoy life in Krakow.
Requirements
The successful candidate will have an M.Sc. degree in
a relevant eld by October 2020. We are looking for
a student with strong interest in Evolution, Molecu-
lar Ecology, Population Genetics and/or Genomics as
well as experience with, or a keen interest in learning,
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; and strong
English language, communication, and

Description of the thesis topic
What is the role of pesticides in the susceptibility of
vertebrates to pathogens?
The concept of \One Health" is based on an integrative
approach to human, animal and environmental health.
It stems from the fact that the majority of emerging
diseases are of animal origin and result from ecological
imbalances. In this context, the study of the impactJune 1, 2020 EvolDir 11
of pesticides on ecosystems, wildlife and human health
takes on its full meaning. Indeed, it is now obvious that
pollutants, by disturbing ecological balances, impact the
dynamics of various diseases. Moreover, these pollutants
are often major endocrine and immune disruptors that
can therefore increase susceptibility to these diseases.
In this context, this thesis project aims to improve the
understanding of the processes and practices responsible
for the emergence of resistance in pathogens, taking the
example of aspergillosis in birds and the use of fungi-
cides as phytosanitary products. It thus aims to dene
situations at risk of emergence and spread of resistant
infectious pathogens to wildlife and humans. This the-
sis project will test the hypothesis that environmental
fungicide contaminations in agroecosystems increase
the presence and occurrence of resistant strains of as-
pergillosis in the environment. It will examine whether
fungicides adversely aect the health of common birds
by weakening their physiological systems and increas-
ing the emergence of resistant strains of aspergillosis.
This thesis project will be based on an interdisciplinary
approach linking ecotoxicology, physiology, functional
ecology, environmental and analytical chemistry, and
molecular biology. The two objectives of the thesis will
be the following:
Obj. 1: Degree of fungicide contamination and resis-
tant strains in anthroposystems The objective will be
to identify within anthroposystems (1) the degree of
fungicide contamination and (2) the occurrence of as-
pergillosis and resistant strains. The eldwork will take
place in wine-growing and urban areas where fungicide
treatments and the occurrence of aspergillosis are impor-
tant. A dozen viticultural, urban and forest sites with a
gradient of fungicide use will be selected. On these sites,
non-lethal blood samples will be taken from common
birds. These measurements will make it possible to mea-
sure the degree of contamination of the ecosystem and
relate it to the occurrence of aspergillosis and resistant
strains.
Objective 2: Experimental study of the inuence of
triazoles on pathogen resistance The objective will be to
understand the additional risk that fungicide contamina-
tion may pose to organisms exposed to pathogens. For
this purpose, captive birds kept in experimental aviaries
at the CEBC will be exposed to environmental doses of
triazoles while other unexposed birds will form a control
group. Following this exposure, the functioning of the
physiological systems involved in pathogen resistance
will be examined (immunity, hormonal axes) in order to
detect the potential for endocrine and immune disrup-
tion of fungicides. This experiment will be conducted
in adult birds, but also in developing chicks to test the
potential deleterious eect of these fungicides on theontogeny of these key physiological systems.
Financial support and valorization The thesis project
is part of the PEPSAN (PI: C. Fritsch, MITI, Mission
pour l'interdisciplinarit e du CNRS) and BIODITOX
(PI: F. Brischoux, ANSES) projects which will provide
nancial support for the missions and analyses related
to this thesis. The project will rely on the expertise of
the thesis directors in ecophysiology and ecotoxicology
and on the means made available at the CEBC (bio-
logical analysis platform, experimental aviaries). The
work will be promoted through scientic publications in
international journals and participation in conferences.
The results will also be transmitted to decision-makers
via the network of supervisors.
Work Context
The student will be part of the Evolutive Ecophysiol-

hypothesis that gut microorganisms aect fat synthesis
in wasps. We will use laboratory and eld-collected pop-
ulations to determine to what extent there is plasticity
in fat synthesis (using stable isotope tracing and Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry). We will further
use molecular techniques to characterize the microbial
community, as well as comparative metagenomics (using
Next Gen Sequencing) to identify the genes that aect
fat synthesis in the host.
The ideal candidate for this position will have a strong
background in ecology and evolution, as well as an inter-16 EvolDir June 1, 2020

endosymbionts, molecular techniques (DNA extraction,
PCR amplication, analyzing DNA sequences), physio-
logical measurements (determining fat content, stable
isotope tracing and analyzing fatty acid proles obtained
with mass spectrometry), planning and designing ex-

PhD Project: Emerging Macroecological and Macroevo-
lutionary Patterns of Island Radiation: A Global As-
sessment.
Understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiver-
sity is a key issue in macroecology and macroevolution.
In this quest, islands along with the exceptional species
radiations (rapid episodes of diversication from a com-
mon ancestor) they harbor have always served as testing
ground for ecological/evolutionary theories. Despite re-
cent accumulation of data for islands, we still lack a
synthetic view of what island radiations are and no
formal extensive comparative analysis across island sys-
tems and lineages has been yet achieved. By means
of meta-analysis, this PhD intends to perform a rst
global assessment of island radiation in order to es-
timate the tempo and mode of diversication among
lineages and archipelagos and to further examine the
relationships between diversication patterns, emerging
community structure and biogeographic processes. At
rst, the project will focus on oceanic archipelagos (is-
lands formed over oceanic plates and never connected to
continental landmasses) since they harbor most of the
spectacular radiations reported in the literature. In the
course of the research project, other types of islands or
island-like systems (continentals, mountains tops) might
be taken into consideration. Overall, we expect this
project to provide strong baseline information regard-
ing the eco-evolutionary processes structuring island
communities.

Your tasks:
From March 2020 onwards the use of native origins
is mandatory according to  c40 BNatSchG if plants are

empirical knowledge about genetic variation of grassland
plant species and will draw conclusions for the system
of regional seed production.
You will analyse 25 representative plant species used in
regional seed production. In each of the regions of origin
several populations will be assessed. You will contribute
to plant collection including coordination of sampling by
volunteers. You will genotype plant samples with SNP
markers using next-generation sequencing techniques
and ddRAD protocol. Based on the broad sample, popu-

Across species you will analyse whether spatial-genetic
dierentiation shows general, species-group specic or
species-specic patterns and which biogeographic and
environmental factors are likely causal. Moreover, the
congruence of spatio-genetic groups with the regions
of origin will be assessed. Ultimately we will consider
which practically relevant suggestions can be drawn from

students, and there will be opportunities to supervise

Neuch^ atel is an attractive city in the French part of
Switzerland with a high quality of life. It is located on

the North and a view of the Bernese alps to the South.
It is is an excellent area for outdoor activities such as

ask for a letter). I will review applications continuously
until I have found a suitable candidate. The position
is available immediately, and I hope to nd someone to
start before October 1.
*Context of SNF project* Most of our ideas about the
evolution of host-parasite systems are based on epidemi-
ologically relevant traits - the rate of parasite-induced
mortality, transmission rate and recovery rate - and on
assumptions about their interactions. While this has
given a useful framework that lets us formulate and
test new ideas, it remains unsatisfying that we gener-
ally assume, rather than understand, the processes of
the infection that underlie these traits and thus that
determine epidemiology. One way towards this under-
standing is to consider how the host's limited resources
are used for the parasite's growth and for the host's
defense against parasites and its development, thereby
letting disease-induced mortality and other traits emerge
naturally from the parasite's dynamics.
Using *theory and experiments* with the microsporid-
ian Vavraia culicis and its host, the mosquito Aedes
aegypti, this proposal takes two approaches to look at
the eects of resources on the dynamics of a parasite
within its host. In a *quantitative* approach, it con-
siders resources as a source of energy and studies how
the energy budget within hosts inuences the link be-
tween the parasite's growth and the host's mortality. In
a *qualitative* approach, it asks whether the relative
contributions of dierent nutrients (focusing on proteins
and sugars), in addition to the energy content, inuence
the parasite's development and the host's response, and
whether the host's preference for nutrients lessens the
damaging impact of the parasite.

HostParasiteCoevolution
A fully funded PhD position is available on host-parasite
coevolution, jointly supervised by Dr Jan Engelstaedter
at The University of Queensland, Australia, and Dr BenJune 1, 2020 EvolDir 21
Longdon at the University of Exeter, UK. The student
will spend time at both partner institutions and will
graduate with a joint degree from both universities.
About the project Pathogens are an inevitable part
of every ecosystem. In humans as well as in livestock
and natural systems, the majority of pathogens have
only arrived in their host species relatively recently, by
switching from a dierent host species. In addition to
the epidemiological processes of within- and between-
host species transmission, pathogens also often evolve
very rapidly 'V their genomes change as they adapt to
their host through processes such as mutation, natural
selection and random genetic drift. To complicate things
further, their hosts also undergo evolutionary change,
and evolution in hosts and pathogens can be tightly
linked: hosts evolve resistance to pathogens and in turn
pathogens evolve to overcome this resistance, resulting
in continuous coevolutionary arms races.
Evolutionary biologists have long been fascinated by
host-pathogen coevolution and a large body of literature
is devoted to understanding the dynamics and patterns
of resistance and susceptibility arising through time and
space, as well as the underlying infection genetics. How-
ever, the scope of these studies is almost exclusively
restricted to a single pair of host and pathogen species.
In this project we will combine theoretical and experi-
mental approaches to investigate more realistic systems
in which coevolution between multiple pathogen and
multiple host species are considered. For the theoretical
part, to be conducted at The University of Queensland
under the supervision of Dr Jan Engelstaedter, math-
ematical models will be constructed and analysed in
which host species may interact with each other through
various processes (e.g., competition or predation), and
pathogens may switch more or less rapidly between host
species. Both analytical methods and computer simula-
tions will be used to assess how coevolution impacts the
ability of pathogens to undergo host shifts and how in
turn host shifts aect coevolution. In the experimental
part of the project, to be performed at the University of
Exeter under Dr Ben Longdon' ^As supervision, these the-
oretical predictions will be scrutinised by using a system
of bacteria as hosts (several Staphylococcus species) and
a range of viruses (bacteriophages) as their pathogens.
This system is ideally suited to study host shifts in a
high-throughput manner, and the experiments will be
the rst to interrogate the interplay between coevolu-
tion and the ability of pathogens to jump between host
species. The results from this project are expected to
have wide-ranging implication in several elds, including
ecosystem stability, emerging infectious diseases, and
agriculture.

resource-based trade-o between reproductive invest-
ment and healthy ageing probably underlie individual
susceptibility to age-related decline. However, these
hypotheses remain experimentally untested.
This project uses a unique avian life history model, ex-
plicitly created to study the links between reproduction
and ageing, to address these knowledge gaps. Using
an articial selection approach, we have created repli-
cated genetic lines of quails (Coturnix japonica) that
dier in their ageing trajectories. Birds selected for high
reproductive investment age quickly and live shorter,
whereas birds selected for low reproductive investment
age slowly and live longer. This experimental model
is thus ideally suited to test the consequences of repro-
ductive investment for the development of age-related
disease. Genomes and transcriptomes of these quail will
be scrutinized using systems biology methods to unravel
the molecular basis of ageing processes, targeting the dis-
covery of genes and pathways that aect reproduction,
ageing and the development of age-related disease.
This project combines the complementary skills and ex-
pertise of researchers in veterinary science, evolutionary
biology, genomics, bioinformatics and systems biology
from the University of Queensland, Australia, the Uni-
versity of Exeter, United Kingdom and the Institute
of Avian Research, Germany. This is a unique PhD
research and training opportunity for a student with a
background in evolutionary biology interested to gain
bioinformatics and systems biology skills, or a student
with a bioinformatics, veterinary or systems biology
background and an interest in evolutionary biology. In
addition to available (phenotypic, WGS, transcriptomic)
datasets, the student will have the opportunity to con-
duct experimental work to test the potential of nutri-
tional interventions in buering genetic susceptibility to
age-related disease.
This cross-disciplinary and synergistic project will pro-
vide novel and essential insights into molecular con-
straints involved in the processes of reproduction that
impact on healthy ageing and have broad implications
for evolutionary biology, animal breeding and welfare,
and human health.

RESEARCH PROJECT: Genetic basis of hornwort
carbon-concentrating mechanisms.
Biophysical carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs)
operating at the single-cell level have evolved indepen-
dently in some eukaryotic algae and a single lineage of
land plants, the hornworts. An essential component
for an ecient biophysical CCM is a pyrenoid, which
represents a specialized compartment inside chloroplasts
that mainly comprise the CO2-xing enzyme RuBisCO.
Hornworts with pyrenoids x signicantly more car-
bon than their relatives without pyrenoids. Given the
repeated gains and losses of pyrenoids in hornworts
during the last 50 million years, we may assume that
their assembly is potentially controlled by a few master
regulators of eco-evolutionary relevance. In a joint ef-
fort, we will combine comparative -omics with reverse
genetics tools to study the genetics, function, and molec-
ular basis of pyrenoid-based CCM in hornwort plastids
under dierent environmental conditions. Guided by
ultrastructure-based monitoring of the pyrenoid assem-
bly in hornworts, we aim to identify the genetic toolkit
of biophysical CCM in hornworts through two interde-
pendent approaches: First, we aim to predict candidate
CCM components in silico though a set of homology
searches that compare the hornwort gene set with algal
CCM component. Second, we employ an exploratory
gene and protein (co)expression proling of isolated plas-
tids collected under low vs. high CO2 concentrations
and under ooding. A strength of our experimental
design is that we contrast up to three pairs of pyrenoid
bearing and pyrenoid lacking hornwort species. Finally,
we will investigate pyrenoid functionality under vari-
ous environmental conditions. Specically, we aim to
conduct localization and functional validation analyses
for a core set of genes discovered in our CCM gene
prediction approaches. These experiments are possible
through our recent advances to establish Anthoceros
agrestis and other hornwort species as a tractable model
system. Together, our collaborative project will not
only allow a comparison of the mechanisms of pyrenoid
assembly between algae and hornworts, but also reveal
general principles and species-specic innovations in the
evolution of carbon-concentrating plastids. Above that,24 EvolDir June 1, 2020
focusing on and understanding the basis of land plant
CCM instead of only the algal form could eventually
contribute to eciently engineer pyrenoid assembly and
boost photosynthetic eciency of crops. Relevant pub-
lications: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-
0618-2, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2017.02.002 .
This project is founded (initially for three years) by the
German National Science Foundation (DFG) MadLand
(https://madland.science/) program to Peter Szovenyi
and Susann Wicke. The project requires collaborative
work including frequent visits to Germany and to the
USA (Fay-Wei Li`s lab at Cornell).
The Dept. of Systematic Botany hosts research groups
working on the evolutionary and ecological drivers of
biodiversity, on the macroevolution of plants, on plant-
insect interactions/pollination, on the evolution of mat-
ing systems, hybridization and speciation. The Dept. of
Plant and Microbial Biology hosts many groups working
on plant molecular and developmental biology, epigenet-
ics, community genomics and plant adaptation. Both
institutes are housed in the beautiful Botanical Gardens
and host a diverse community of researchers in plant
biology.
Ideal candidates will have an MSc in biology with a spe-
cialization in evolution, developmental genetics and/or
bioinformatics. This position primarily involves reverse
genetic, microscopy, gas exchange measurements and
bioinformatic work and requires advanced skills in han-
dling, analyzing and interpreting high-throughput next-
generation sequencing data. Good skills in assembling
vectors, carrying out genetic transformations and mi-
croscopy are also required. Previous experience with
Chlamydomonas pyrenoids is a plus but not necessary.
In case not all these skills are covered, the willingness
to quickly acquire them is absolutely necessary. The
student will closely work together with the second PhD
student/postdoctoral associate in Germany on this grant.
Students should be willing to work both in the wet lab
and in the oce doing computational work. The posi-
tion is initially for three years. Selected candidates will
be enrolled in one of the two aliated PhD schools in
evolution or plant sciences.

can be found here:https://dig-it.uni-greifswald.de Job
description: DIG-IT!has been running since mid-2019,
meaning that numerous digitisation tasks have already
been concluded. TheDIG-IT!consortium is thus able to
access a broad variety of digitised data, ranging from bat
images and bat sound recordings to tree cross-sections
and pollen images and 3D root data. First analyses
of this data has already been performed. The position
advertised here, which belongs to the Biomathematics

growth be predicted if the distribution of nutrients in
the soil is known? Can multidimensional data support
the deep learning techniques in order to obtain useful
presumptions?
There is an immense variety of mathematical, statistical
and computer science questions in this project . The
postdoc can therefore play an active role and make the
most of his or her individual strengths and creativity
in order to contribute to the level of knowledge gained
byDIG-IT!. In particular, the postdoc is able to choose
the mathematical and computer science tools and tech-
niques used to tackle these questions in accordance with
his/her strengths and interests.
The digitisation of image and acoustic data is not a core
task of the position on oer. However, support with pro-
gramme adjustment and possibly with the digitisation
of some extra data are part of the job description. In
particular, the successful candidate is expected to sup-

Assistant Researcher position in the Unckless Lab at
the University of Kansas
The Unckless lab at the University of Kansas invites
applications for an assistant researcher that will focus
on the evolution of immune peptides. We recently found
that several Drosophila antimicrobial peptides show sig-
natures of balancing selection (the adaptive maintenance
of multiple alleles). This position would involve dis-
secting the mechanisms of balancing selection on these
peptides using a combination of approaches including
microbiology (minimum inhibitory concentrations, zone
of inhibition assays) and biochemistry (structural and
functional studies using circular dichroism, NMR, etc.).
The goal is to understand how balancing selection main-
tains alleles from the ecological to the biochemical level.32 EvolDir June 1, 2020
The successful candidate should have experience in some
of the approaches listed above and would be able to de-
velop skills in some of the other approaches. A bachelor's
degree in biology or a related eld is required.
The Unckless Lab studies evolutionary genetics in gen-
eral with a focus on the evolution of immunity and
selsh genetic elements. The University of Kansas is
home to both the Department of Molecular Biosciences
and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy and members of the lab interact directly with other
labs spanning biochemistry, microbiology, genetics, ge-
nomics, evolution and ecology. Lawrence, Kansas is a
vibrant college town with plenty of good food, cultural
events and a wonderful downtown area. The cost of
living is very reasonable. We are about 45 minutes from

COVID and Biodiversity
Dear Colleague
We are writing on behalf of a COVID Task Force, a
CETAF-DiSSCo joint action (CETAF = Consortium
of European Taxonomic Facilities, https://cetaf.org/;
DiSSCo = Distributed System of Scientic Collections,
https://www.dissco.eu/).
As a group of researchers working in dierent elds, we
recently established a COVID Task Force, with the aim
to help clarify the links between biodiversity, human
pressure and the origin and causes of coronaviruses and
similar disease spill-over, as well as to identify the ac-
tions that should be put in place to complement the
eorts made in other disciplines. This eort is equally
important to anticipate and prevent the occurrence and
propagation of zoonotic infectious diseases worldwide.One of the rst tangible actions we want to pursue is a
horizon scanning exercise among stakeholders to identify
priority questions that scientists should explore to reach
a better understanding of pathogen origins, spill-over
processes and their ecological correlates.
The answers to these questions are needed to clarify the
role that certain animal species play with respect to
the pandemics such as the current one, and the environ-
mental conditions that may facilitate these phenomena,

Teaching about Mimicry
Hi everyone,
For decades I have run a practical at the start of my
relatively introductory Evolutionary Biology module
where students play games as predatory birds attacking
butteries. They end up getting to grips with frequency
dependent selection through Batesian mimicry.
It will not survive social distancing, so I have been look-
ing for a simple simulation or on-line game which covers
this, so far without much success. Does anyone know of
anything suitable?
More generally, I guess this is one example of a much
bigger issue we are all going to be tackling this summer
anyone for an on-line compilation of such resources for
teaching Evolutionary Biology?
Best wishes,
Mike Ritchie

About the Institute Institute of Zoology (IOZ), Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), is a government-funded
research institution in zoological sciences. It has a long
history of over 80 years. The predecessor of IOZ was
Fan Memorial Institute of Biology founded in 1928.
Many distinguished scientists including thirteen CAS
Academicians started their research career in IOZ. Some
of them are founders of various sub-disciplines of zoology
in China, such as Professor Bing Zhi, rst director of
IOZ and one of the main founders of modern biology
in China. Several sub-disciplines in zoological sciences
in China were derived from IOZ, such as entomology,
animal ecology, and experimental embryology. IOZ also
has a long history of service to the country with many
signicant contributions, such as successful control of
China's chronic agricultural pest-locust, control andmanagement of other pest insects and rodents, estab-
lishment of nature reserves in China, conservation of
giant panda, crested ibis and other endangered wildlife,
reproduction and contraception, and sh nuclear trans-
fer. Zoological Museum of IOZ has over 8 million animal
specimens. Several eld stations and research bases also
play important role in IOZ research programs.
About the PI Dr. Bai has been engaged in the sys-
tematics and evolution of insects, e.g. scarabs and ice
crawlers. On the basis of inheriting the traditional
taxonomy, he has opened up a new research direction
of the new taxonomy driven by new technologies such
as quantication, Big Data and Articial Intelligence.
The main academic achievements are as follows. (1)
He systematically revised the Chinese Scarabaeoidea
and Grylloblattodea, built a database on Chinese insect
type specimens, and published a new insect order, 4 new
families, and more than 200 new genera. (2) In the three
key aspects of taxonomic research (character cognition,
character comparison, character evolution), new tech-
nology innovation-driven research has been carried out,
including the development of new instruments and new
software in digital and three-dimensional technologies,
the integration of quantitative geometric morphometrics
and erection on the new research paradigm. The estab-
lishment of a new insect order, Alienoptera, and the
systematic status of some important extinction groups
were revealed. The origin of dung feeding behavior
was investigated. An Intelligent Identication System
of World Beetles (BICS, http://beetle.ioz.ac.cn/) was
created.

increase the capacity of its natural populations to accu-
mulate adaptive variation, but the candidate will extend
well-beyond this system to additional species. General
conclusions will be drawn taking advantage from repli-
cated ploidy-variable plant species naturally facing mul-
tiple environmental challenges, which are partly already
sampled and sequenced. Alongside the head - start with
available preliminary data, the candidate is expected to
be fully involved in the overall project design and lead
the analytical part of the project. For overall info on the
Starting ERC project see https://botany.natur.cuni.cz/-

About the Institute Institute of Zoology (IOZ), Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), is a government-funded
research institution in zoological sciences. It has a long
history of over 80 years. The predecessor of IOZ was
Fan Memorial Institute of Biology founded in 1928.June 1, 2020 EvolDir 45
Many distinguished scientists including thirteen CAS
Academicians started their research career in IOZ. Some
of them are founders of various sub-disciplines of zoology
in China, such as Professor Bing Zhi, rst director of
IOZ and one of the main founders of modern biology
in China. Several sub-disciplines in zoological sciences
in China were derived from IOZ, such as entomology,
animal ecology, and experimental embryology. IOZ also
has a long history of service to the country with many
signicant contributions, such as successful control of
China $B!G(Bs chronic agricultural pest-locust, control
and management of other pest insects and rodents, es-
tablishment of nature reserves in China, conservation of
giant panda, crested ibis and other endangered wildlife,
reproduction and contraception, and sh nuclear trans-
fer. Zoological Museum of IOZ has over 8 million animal
specimens. Several eld stations and research bases also
play important role in IOZ research programs.
About the PI Dr. Bai has been engaged in the sys-
tematics and evolution of insects, e.g. scarabs and ice
crawlers. On the basis of inheriting the traditional
taxonomy, he has opened up a new research direction
of the new taxonomy driven by new technologies such
as quantication, Big Data and Articial Intelligence.
The main academic achievements are as follows. (1)
He systematically revised the Chinese Scarabaeoidea
and Grylloblattodea, built a database on Chinese insect
type specimens, and published a new insect order, 4 new
families, and more than 200 new genera. (2) In the three
key aspects of taxonomic research (character cognition,
character comparison, character evolution), new tech-
nology innovation-driven research has been carried out,
including the development of new instruments and new
software in digital and three-dimensional technologies,
the integration of quantitative geometric morphometrics
and erection on the new research paradigm. The estab-
lishment of a new insect order, Alienoptera, and the
systematic status of some important extinction groups
were revealed. The origin of dung feeding behavior
was investigated. An Intelligent Identication System
of World Beetles (BICS, http://beetle.ioz.ac.cn/) was
created.

The Molecular Ecology Laboratory of the NIBIO
Svanhovd Research Station in northern Norway is
seeking postdoctoral researchers that would be inter-
ested in joint development of applications for Marie
Sk^A ©^A ©odowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellow-
ships. MSCA-IF grants are available for individual
researchers having a PhD degree or four years of equiv-
alent experience, and the deadline of this year' ^As
call is September 9, 2020. For more information,
see https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/-
actions/individual-fellowships en).
The NIBIO Svanhovd Research Station is a hub for
ecological and genetics-based research and monitoring
of arctic and subarctic ecosystems (https://svanhovd-
molecol.no/). We are seeking highly motivated biolo-
gists with expertise in molecular ecology, landscape or
evolutionary genomics, or metabarcoding and eDNA
methods interested in collaboratively developing an in-
coming MSCA-IF grant application with us, preferably
in one of the projects outlined below. To ensure that
we have enough time to prepare the application(s), we
would be thankful to receive a letter of interest, stating
your interest and experience, and a CV by June 15,
2020, sent by e-mail to cornelya.klutsch@nibio.no and
snorre.hagen@nibio.no. The nature of the envisioned
projects requires prior experience in genetic/genomic
laboratory work (e.g., preparation of high-throughput se-
quencing (HTS) libraries) and bioinformatic processing
of HTS data. However, projects can include also ecolog-
ical eldwork, depending on the interests of potential
candidates.
The Svanhovd Research Station is located in the village
of Svanvik beside the Pasvik river, in the middle of
the wedge of Norwegian land that separates Russia and
Finland in the north. The region represents a transition
zone where the eastern Siberian taiga meets the west-
ern Boreal forest, and where northern mountain birch
forests transition into arctic tundra. Numerous charac-
teristic species of plants, mammals, birds, and insects
are found at this intersection of dierent ecosystems.
With a modern molecular-genetic lab on-site, NIBIO
Svanhovd presents an ideal location for a molecular
geneticist with outdoor tendencies.
Our research station is involved in a broad range of ba-
sic and applied eco-evolutionary questions and transna-50 EvolDir June 1, 2020
tional monitoring of wildlife and sh species. These
range from the application of genetic and genomic tools
for population and conservation genetics to the use of
metabarcoding and eDNA approaches for studying soil
and freshwater biota as well as animal diets.
Potential postdoctoral projects include, but are not
limited to:
1. Understanding re-colonization mechanisms in large
carnivores:
NIBIO Svanhovd has a long tradition of non-invasive
genetic monitoring of brown bear populations in Nor-
way, Finland, and Russia. We are now expanding our
research activities to genomic approaches studying re-
colonization processes in populations of large carnivores.
Recolonization can result in rapid shifts in the distribu-
tion and density of populations, resulting in changes in
selection pressures acting on functional traits connected
to dispersal, exploratory behavior, reproduction, and
immunity. Building on a large existing in-house collec-
tion of scat and hair samples, we will apply dierent
functional genomic approaches to identify gene regions
under selection. This project includes also the oppor-
tunity to collaborate with our international partners
in Fennoscandia and Russia. Alternatively, metabar-
coding and microbiome analyses to study spatial and
seasonal dietary changes in large carnivores, parasite
loads, and the microbiome are possible based on existing
collections.
2. Freshwater sh genomics:
Arctic and subarctic freshwater ecosystems are exposed
to multiple stressors (e.g., climate change, arrival of inva-
sive species from more southern regions, eutrophication,
pollution). Yet, many species, interactions, and systems
remain understudied and monitored in these ecosystems.
Several lines of research are possible, ranging from di-
etary analyses based on metabarcoding and microbiome
analyses of existing collections to investigating the im-
pact of invasive species, like pink salmon, on native sh
populations or more population genomics research of
specic sh species (for example, brown trout, grayling,
etc.).

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION IN
METAGENOMICS
TOPIC: Unravelling the Marine Planktonic Genomic
Dark Matter
One full-time postdoctoral position for 1 year is
available at the Mus eum National d'Histoire Na-
turelle (MNHN) and Sorbonne Universit e (http://-
www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), located in Paris, France.
The post-doctoral fellow will work in the framework of
the European project *Blue-Cloud* (https://www.blue-
cloud.org/), which aims at improving the knowledge
of our oceans and seas and bringing them closer to
citizens. The post-doc will be part of the *Plankton
Genomics *demonstrator (https://www.blue-cloud.org/-
demonstrators/plankton-genomics).
Despite its importance for human well being, marine
plankton remains poorly characterized and understood,
in particular because of its high diversity in terms of
species, functions, but also behaviours, and more glob-
ally their role(s) in the ecosystems. Recent metagenomic
studies have revealed that marine plankton is far more
diverse than previously thought, with hundreds of thou-
sands of genetically distinct taxa and more than 150
million genes documented, however more than half of
the planktonic omic sequences has still unknown tax-
onomy and/or function. The post-doc will unravel the
meaning of this planktonic omic 'dark matter' in order
to:
1) characterize the extent and the distribution of plank-
tonic omic dark matter at a global scale and describe
the environmental contexts and ecological preferences;
2) infer gene functions based on sequence similarity and
co-expression patterns across a wide range of marine
environments and biogeographies.
A specic focus on eukaryotic communities will be done
for cross-reference purpose with imaging data.
Within the \Institut de Syst ematique, Evolution et
Biodiversit e" at the MNHN (http://isyeb.mnhn.fr/en),
the post-doc fellow will be hosted in the team *Ate-
lier de Bioinformatique*, and she/he will work in di-June 1, 2020 EvolDir 51

d'Analyse G enomique des Eucaryotes, Evry, France)
and the LOV (*Laboratoire d'Oc eanographie de Ville-
franche*, Villefranche-sur-mer, France). He/she will
benet from the active network from the european *Blue-
Cloud* project and from the other ongoing projects from
the labs (i.e. FORMAL project & consortium, From Ob-
seRving to Modelling oceAn Life; Oceanomics project &
Tara Oceans consortium). The post-doc fellow will in-
teract with experts in bioinformatics, data assimilation
(omics, imaging), biostatistics and numerical modelling,
but also in evolution, ecology and marine biology.
QUALIFICATIONS - PhD in Bioinformatics (or Biology
with strong skills in Bioinformatics).
The candidates are expected to have an experience in
programming, statistics and omic studies. Interests in
ecology, evolution and/or oceanography is considered as
a plus.
SALARY - about 2100 euro per month after taxes (more
depending on experience); includes extensive healthcare
and benets. Position is full-time and funded for 1 year,
with opportunities for extensions.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
The application should include a (1) CV detailing expe-

as the mechanisms and consequences of mutation rate
variation, the impacts of natural selection on the hu-
man genome and phenotypes, and the genetic basis and
evolution of human disease and polygenic traits. One
major research direction is investigating how and when
genetic mutations arise and accumulate over the life-
time of an individual in the germline and in somatic
tissues. Another direction is to understand the genetic
architecture and evolution of complex traits, including
common diseases.
Both postdocs will work on these problems by analyzing
genomic data, primarily of modern and ancient human
populations. We are also open to candidates with their
own research projects in the broad area of human pop-
ulation and evolutionary genetics. In addition, there
will be opportunities to work on other projects involv-
ing population genomic analysis and collaborating with
other labs in the department.
Both positions have exible start dates and may begin
as early as Oct 1, 2020. The appointment is initially forone year with the opportunity to be renewed for up to
three more years, depending on performance, funding,
and the postdoc's personal preference. We particularly
encourage applications from candidates who have re-
cently completed, or will soon complete, their PhD.
Qualications
Required:
- PhD in genetics, evolutionary biology, computational
biology, bioinformatics, statistics, computer science or
a related quantitative eld;
- robust mathematical and statistical skills, with a track
record of applying them to genomic or other biological
data;
- comprehensive experience in working with linux/unix-
based environment and command lines;
- prociency in one or more programming languages
(e.g., R, Python, Perl, C/C++);
- good scientic communication skills in writing and in
oral presentations.
Nice to haves:
- strong motivation and ability to work independently;
- formal training in population genetics or statistics (e.g.,
demonstrated in transcripts);
- experience with population genetic analyses;
- familiarity with whole-genome sequencing data genera-
tion, processing and analysis;
- enthusiasm to mentor graduate students;
- broad interests in biomedical science outside genetics.
To apply
Interested applicants please contact Ziyue at ziyue-
gao[at]pennmedicine[dot]upenn[dot]edu with a brief
summary of your background and research interests

Vienna PolygenicAdaptation
Polygenic adaptation: a postdoctoral position is avail-
able at the Institute of Population Genetics, Vetmeduni
Vienna ( https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/population-
genetics/). The research focus of the Institute of Pop-
ulation Genetics is on understanding the genetics of
adaptation. This central question in evolutionary bi-
ology is being tackled using up-to-date methods and
a variety of approaches, including experimental evolu-
tion, quantitative genetics, functional genetics, empirical
population genetics, bioinformatics and statistics.
Vienna has an outstanding community of evolutionary
biologists ( https://www.univie.ac.at/evolvienna/) and
a unique cluster of scientists with a keen interest to
understand polygenic adaptation (e.g.: N. Barghi, N.
Barton, R. B urger, J. Hermisson, R. Koer, M. Nord-
borg and H. Sachdeva).
Adaptation to new environments is frequently driven by
traits with a polygenetic basis. Nevertheless, the charac-
terization of the adaptive architecture, in particular in
natural populations, is challenging. The contribution of
individual loci to the phenotypic changes associated with
adaptation to new environmental conditions is so small
that their identication and functional characterization
is frequently not possible.
The successful candidate will join a team of scientists
taking advantage of experimental evolution to study
the adaptive architecture of temperature adaptation - a
highly polygenic trait. Manipulating the genetic com-
position of a series of founder populations provides an
unmatched opportunity to study polygenic adaptation
in *Drosophila*. We are using a combination of genomic
analyses with high throughput molecular phenotyping62 EvolDir June 1, 2020
(RNA-Seq, metablomics, proteomics) and targeted high-
level phenotypes (e.g. behavior) to study these experi-
mental populations. The goal is to understand polygenic
adaptation in the context of the underlying functional
variation and use this information to predict adaptive
responses in the laboratory and natural populations.
We are looking for a candidate with a background in
quantitative genetics and experience in handling large
data sets. A solid background in population genetics and
statistics will be further assets. The successful applicant
will be supported by technicians for the collection of
phenotypic data and the maintenance of experimental
populations.
Upon outstanding performance, a group leader position
can be oered to establish her/his independent research
at the institute.
The position is available for at least two years start-
ing August 2019, but the exact starting date is ne-
gotiable. The application should be emailed to chris-
tian.schloetterer@vetmeduni.ac.at as a single pdf con-
taining CV, list of publications, a statement of research
interests, and the names of three references with contact
details. While the search will continue until the position
is lled, applications should be received by 15.6.2020 to
ensure full consideration.

Online AdaptationGenomics
Sep14-18
Dear all,
the registrations are now open for the Physalia course
on Adaptation Genomics, which will take place ON-
LINE from the 14th to the 18th of September:
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
courseadaptationgenomics/ )
Instructors: Dr. Anna Tigano (University of New Hamp-
shire) and Dr Claire Merot (University Laval).
This course provides an introduction to the study of the
genomic basis of adaptation using population genomics
approaches applied to the analysis of both sequenceand structural genetic variation. The instructors will
guide the participants from the handling of raw genomic
data and data exploration (e.g., summary statistics and
population structure) up to more advanced methods,
including genotype-environment associations based on
both sequence and structural variants. Through hands-
on exercises, the course will teach basic bioinformatics
skills and how to manipulate, visualize and interpret
genomic data and patterns.
Learning Outcomes
1) Handling genomic data from raw reads to genetic
variants
2) Calculating basic population genetic statistics
3) Visualizing genetic population structure
4) Searching for signatures of selection in the genome
5) Accounting for putative structural variants64 EvolDir June 1, 2020
6) Understanding the potential and the limitations of
dierent methods to study the genomic basis of adapta-
tion

\INTRODUCTION TO DEEP LEARNING FOR BIOL-
OGISTS", which will be held online from the 28th of
September to the 1st of October.
Course website:( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course67/ )
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning what deep learn-
ing is and how to develop a deep learning model for
applications in biology. It will include information useful
for both absolute beginners and more advanced users
willing to delve into some aspects of the implementation
of deep learning. We will start by introducing general
concepts of deep learning presenting a functioning model
and then we will progressively describe the main building
blocks of a deep learning model and how the internal
machinery works. Attendees are expected to have a
background in biology and the research problems involv-
ing prediction, inference, pattern discovery; previous
exposure to predictive experiments would be benecial.
There will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practicalJune 1, 2020 EvolDir 65
exercises using mainly Python, Jupyter Notebooks and
the Linux command line. Some basic understanding of
Python programming and the Linux environment will
be advantageous, but is not required.

standing of:
- the basic theoretical background of deep learning, both
in terms of basic building blocks and of commonly used,
state-of-the-art architectures
- dierences between classication, regression, segmen-
tation, and how to frame a real-world problem in terms
of these classes
- the main steps involved in building a deep learning
model for prediction problems in biology, comprising
how to evaluate prediction accuracy and how to compare
and choose dierent models
- how to use real-world data for statistical learning,
comprising data preparation and data augmentation

Online SeascapeGenomics Oct12-16
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the Physalia course on
\Seascape Genomics", which will take place ONLINE
from the 12th to the 16th of October.
Instructors:
Dr. Laura Benestan (CEFE-CNRS, FR) and Oliver
Selmoni (EPFL, CH).Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course70/ )
In this course, students will learn the basics of this ap-
proach and train using state of the art methods. Firstly,
students will learn how to extract environmental data
from publicly available databases and how to use it to
characterize the seascape structure and conditions. For
instance, students will learn how to use remote sensing
data to describe sea water temperature oscillations or
sea water movements. Next, the course will bring its
focus on genomic analyses: students will learn how to
evaluate genetic structures in the marine environment
and how to calculate and display connectivity between
populations. The combination of environmental and
genomic data will also lead to the study of local adapta-
tion. Students will learn dierent methods to discover
genetic/genomic signatures potentially involved in adap-
tation against specic environmental constraints. The
course will also cover the critical task of the interpre-
tation and validation of the results, particularly in an
applied conservation and management context. Finally,
the workshop will consider the crucial aspects and good
habits to account for designing a seascape genomics ex-
periment (e.g. sampling design) from a relevant scientic
question.

ONLINE course \Population genomic inference from
low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data"
When: 19-22 October 2020

College London, UK)
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course64/ )68 EvolDir June 1, 2020
In this course, we will explore workows and the underly-
ing rationale behind producing, processing, and analyz-
ing low-coverage sequencing data for population genomic
inference. Given that most species have insucient refer-
ence data to allow reliable genotype imputation, we will
focus on genotype likelihood-based methodology that
can be applied to any system. We will primarily cover
methods and algorithms implemented in the ANGSD
software package and associated programs, providing
best-practice guidelines and discussion of how partic-
ipants can make maximal use of low-coverage whole
genome re-sequencing data for their studies.
The course is aimed at researchers who might have pre-
vious experience with next generation sequencing (NGS)
data (e.g. exome/RAD/pooled sequencing) and wish
to explore the potential for using low-coverage whole-
genome sequencing for their studies.
All hands-on exercises will be run in a Linux environ-
ment on remote servers. Statistical analyses and data
visualization will be run in R.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if itJune 1, 2020 EvolDir 69
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
