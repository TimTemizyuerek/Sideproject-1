MEEGID VIII - Nov. 30 to Dec. 4 2006 -
Bangkok (Thailand) “Molecular Epidemiology and
Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases” ( http://-
www.th.ird.fr/events/2006/meegid.htm ).
Call for abstracts for the Symposium on “Integra-
tive models for the dynamics of antigenically-diverse
pathogens”, chaired by Gabriela Gomes (Instituto Gul-
benkian de Ciˆ encia, Portugal) and Olivier Restif =
(University of Cambridge, UK).
Deadline: September 30th.
Progress towards the control and eradication of infec-
tious diseases has been seriously challenged by adap-
tive diversiﬁcation and evolution of pathogens. The
key to a better understanding, and ultimately control
of these processes lies in innovative, multi-disciplinary
approaches, including microbiology, genetics, immunol-
ogy, evolutionary biology and epidemiology. Mathe-
matical models can play a pivotal role in this challenge,
by reconciling and assembling key concepts from those
diverse areas of research. As shown recently with SARS
or (prospective) pandemic inﬂuenza, models can tackle
real-life scenarios and produce quantitative predictions
for public health policies. Dialogue and concerted re-search between all actors of the biomedical community
need to be fostered by all means. MEEGID VIII will
provide a great opportunity to discuss and promote
mathematical models for infectious diseases among the
broader scientiﬁc and medical community. In line with
the objectives of the conference, we will favour contri-
butions that emphasize applications of models relevant
to South-East Asia in particular and tropical diseases
in general.

Recent Advances in Statistical Genetics and Bioinfor-
matics
Monday 11 December to Friday 15 December 2006
in association with the Newton Institute programme
Stochastic Computation in the Biological Sciences (23
October to 15 December 2006)
Workshop Organisers: Wally Gilks (Leeds) and Simon
Tavar´ e (USC/Cambridge)
Theme of Workshop: The workshop will focus on top-
ics from bioinformatics and statistical genetics. Bioin-
formatics has grown up around the rapidly expanding
databases of DNA sequence, molecular structure and
interaction. Understanding the evolutionary and func-
tional relationships between these biomolecules is per-
haps the greatest challenge of 21st century science. Ad-
vanced statistical methods are becoming increasingly
important in this endeavour. The arrival of dense geno-
typing arrays has provided huge amounts of SNP data
which are being used in eﬀorts to map genes associated
with complex traits. Statistical methods for designing
and analyzing such whole genome scans are beginning
to appear, but many open problems remain. The use
of SNP data to estimate recombination rates across the
genome, to detect evidence of selective sweeps and to
infer demographic history has also provided some statis-
tical challenges that will be addressed in the workshop.
Conﬁrmed Speakers: Andrew Clark (Cornell), Mano-
lis Dermitzakis (Sanger Institute), Peter Donnelly (Ox-
ford), Peter Green (Bristol), Jotun Hein (Oxford),
Nick Patterson (Broad Institute), Bruce Ponder (Cam-
bridge), Sylvia Richardson (Imperial), Alun Thomas
(Utah), Janet Thornton (EBI), Lorenz Wernisch (Birk-
beck), Ziheng Yang (UCL).
Location and Cost: The workshop will take place at the
Newton Institute and accommodation for participants
will be provided in a single study bedroom with shared
bathroom at Wolfson Court. The workshop package,
costing 500GBP, includes accommodation, breakfast
and dinner from dinner on Sunday 10 December to
breakfast on Saturday 16 December 2006, and lunch
and refreshments during the days that lectures take
place. Participants who wish to attend but do not re-
quire the workshop package will be charged a registra-
tion fee of 40GBP. Self-supporting participants are very
welcome to apply.

Biodiversity Conservation - From Genes To Habitats
Location Congress Center Davos, Switzerland Date
23/24 November, 2006 Registration until 30 September,
2006 at http://www.wsl.ch/intrabiodiv Biodiversity is
a key parameter for ecosystem functioning. Conserva-
tion eﬀorts need to consider all three levels of biodi-
versity - habitats, species and genes. However, genetic
diversity has been largely ignored to date and empir-
ical studies are lacking. The EC-funded project IN-
TRABIODIV elucidates the relationships between the
three biodiversity levels, exempliﬁed on plant diversity
in the European Alps and the Carpathians. The results
should provide a basis for decisions on conservation ar-
eas. The conference Biodiversity Conservation - From
Genes to Habitats aims at demonstrating the latest re-
search results in biodiversity conservation and their rel-
evance for the protection of our natural resources. This
event will provide a platform for those interested in
the conservation of biodiversity such as scientists, gov-
ernmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, or
politicians. The goal is to bridge the gap between sci-
entiﬁc outcomes and their implementation in practical
management and conservation.

istration http://www.wsl.ch/intrabiodiv The organiz-
ing committee welcomes your participation in this con-

The graduate student aﬃliates of the Indiana Univer-
sity / University of Oregon IGERT in Evolution, De-
velopment and Genomics would like to extend an in-
vitation to attend our upcoming symposium entitled
“The Origin of Novel Features” on October 6-8, 2006
on the IU campus in Bloomington, IN. This topic has
been chosen because it lies at the heart of evolution
of development (evo-devo) today. While much of evo-
devo has traditionally focused on deep connections in
macro-evolution, more micro-evolutionary perspectives
and approaches are now entering the ﬁeld. This makes
it possible to ask the diﬃcult and exciting question–
how do qualitatively new features arise in evolution?
We have assembled an interdisciplinary group of speak-
ers conducting important research towards this aim.
These speakers represent a diversity of ideas and organ-
isms (from dung beetles to humans) and utilize multiple
methodologies (from molecular biology to eco-devo).

LAST CALL FOR REGISTRATIONS AND PAPERS
!!!Deadline for registration and submission of abstracts:
30th September!!!
This informal, annual meeting is designed to bring to-
gether people starting their research on molluscs, to
give them the opportunity to present and discuss their8 EvolDir September 1, 2006
work and to compare notes on methods and problems.
Attendance is open to all, but speakers and poster pre-
senters should be research students, post-doctoral re-
searchers, undergraduates starting molluscan projects
or dissertations, and amateurs engaged in substantial
projects, which have not yet been published. Any
topic related to molluscs is acceptable: palaeontolog-
ical, physiological, behavioural, ecological, systematic,
morphological or molecular.
Short talks ( 15 mins ) or posters may be oﬀered. They
need not be polished accounts of completed work: de-
scriptions of new methods, work in progress, appeals for
assistance with unsolved problems are equally accept-
able. Powerpoint presentations are the usual form, but
should be discussed in advance (see registration form
overleaf).
In addition to talks and posters there will be oppor-
tunities to acquire reprints contributed by members of
the Society. The forum will end with a wine reception.
There is no registration fee; a limited amount of help
with travel costs will be available for presenters who
cannot claim them from elsewhere.

CSIC Spain DNABarCoding
A graduate student position is available beginning 2007
in the laboratory of Dr. Joan Pons. The project will
involve the isolation of genomic DNA and the ampli-
ﬁcation of the cox1 gene of 6000 specimens to delimit
species boundaries using DNA sequences alone (DNA
barcoding, DNA taxonomy). Project will focus in three
arthropod groups: 1) water beetles (leaded by Dr. Rib-
era from Museo Ciencias Naturales de Madrid, Spain,
and Dr. Balke from Museum of Zoology of Munich,
Germany) 2) spiders (leaded by Dr. Arnedo from Uni-
versity of Barcelona, Spain, Dr. Hormiga from The
George Washington University, USA, and Dr. Ramirez
from Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales CON-
ICET (Argentina). 3) membracid homopters leaded by
Dr. Yves from Smithsonian Institute (Panama).
The main goals of the project is to obtain the DNA
barcode for 6000 specimen and estimate the alpha and
beta diversity of the 5 localities studied in Panama us-
ing DNA sequences alone.
The student will focus on the molecular work but
he/she will work on the morphological description of
the water beetles since one of the main goals of the
project is compare the limits of those species deter-
mined by classical morphology with those delimit by
DNA sequences alone.
Techniques used will include DNA isolation, PCR,
DNA sequencing, and primer design. Background in
the relevant molecular techniques is highly desirable,as well as interest in species/populations boundaries,
biodiversity estimation, conservation genetics.
A master degree in zoology, taxonomy, conservation ge-
netics, phylogenetics or related subject is highly desir-
able. A good proﬁciency in Spanish is a bonus but
English will be the working language.
We are particularly interested in students trained on
bio-informatics but willing to apply his/her skills on
taxonomy, phylogenetics, and conservation genetics.
Those students will be trained on molecular techniques
and ﬁeld work.
The fellowship position is for 3 years and about 900
Euros a month. The fellowship also includes health in-
surance.
The student will be funded by a fellowship included
in the project Aplicaci´ on de la t´ ecnica del c´ odigo de
barras del ADN para la estimaci´ on r´ apida de grupos
megadiversos en puntos calientes de la biodiversidad:
Los artr´ opodos del Istmo de Panam´ a funded by the
prestigious Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Founda-
tion (BBVA). Applicantion should be send to Dr Joan
Pons (joan.pons@upf.edu). The closing date for appli-
cations is 30 September, 2006.
Please include:

CardiﬀU MetalAdaptation
Please circulate to any potntial candidates:
A PhD studentship is available in the ﬁeld of Molec-
ular Ecology starting from November 2006, to study
the adaptation of a biological ’sentinel’ species within
heavy metal contaminated environments.
Supervisor: Dr Georgina Harper Co-supervised by Mike
Bruford & John Morgan at Cardiﬀ University
The project will investigate evolution and adaptation
within populations of the ’sentinel’ earthworm species
Lumbricus rubellus that are subject to high levels of
Ni contamination in their environment. We aim to de-
termine whether such L. rubellus populations are sus-
tained by local recruitment, by which we may infer thatpopulations are suﬃciently locally adapted to allow suc-
cessful reproduction or whether such populations rep-
resent ’demographic sinks’, sustained by dispersal from
’source’ populations in less contaminated land.
Speciﬁcally, the project will utilise molecular genetic
markers (Microsatellites and AFLPs), and will investi-
gate the relationship of this genotype data to pheno-
typic data, obtained via metabolomics (analytical pro-
ﬁling of metabolites in biological samples). The combi-
nation of these techniques will facilitate a new level of
understanding of adaptation to environmental change,
as if dispersal is shown to occur, we can investigate to
what extent it results in gene-ﬂow, since this may have
major implications for the maintenance of genetic di-
versity in sentinel populations, potentially facilitating
future adaptive evolution.
The studentship will be based at the University of
Glamorgan, and is part of a collaborative project be-
tween the University of Glamorgan, Imperial College
and Cardiﬀ University. The studentship is fully funded
by the Leverhulme Trust (UK only funding). Appli-
cants should have, or expect to obtain at least a 2:1
honours degree in a biological science, preferably with
some experience and an interest in population genetics
or molecular ecology.
For informal enquiries, full information and applica-
tion forms contact Dr Georgina Harper, email gl-

Cologne EvolSeedDormancy
PhD position: Evolution of seed dormancy in Cologne,
Germany
Title: The genetic basis of adaptative responses to local
demands on seed dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana
A PhD position is open at the Max Planck Institute for
Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany; start-
ing as soon as possible to join the group of population
genetics and cis-regulatory evolution, headed by Juli-
ette de Meaux in the department of Genetics and Plant
Breeding.14 EvolDir September 1, 2006
Applicants with a master degree (or equivalent qual-
iﬁcation) in evolutionary biology and with interest in
functional and molecular studies of diversity are invited
to apply. A background in plant biology is not a pre-
requisite.
Summary This project proposes to investigate the foot-
print of local selection on genes inﬂuencing seed dor-
mancy in Arabidopsis thaliana. In our group, we are es-
pecially interested in the dynamics of cis-regulatory vs.
coding variation. Cis-regulatory regions are thought to
evolve faster than coding regions and should thus play
a predominant role in a species ability to adapt to local
conditions. Special attention will be paid to the rela-
tive role played by these diﬀerent DNA regions in the
evolution of seed dormancy.
Scientiﬁc environment
Our group is interested in evaluating the role played
by cis-regulatory regions in adaptive evolution. For
this, we are undertaking an analysis of nucleotide and
functional evolutionary dynamics of promoter regions
within and among closely related species of the Ara-
bidopsis genus and combine bioinformatics, experimen-
tal and population genetics approaches. Our ultimate
goal is to relate this diversity to its ecological role in
natural environments. The study of seed dormancy of-
fers an optimal ecological context in which to exam-
ine the role of both cis-regulatory and coding variation
on phenotypic evolution. For this project, we bene-
ﬁt from a close collaboration with Wim Soppe’s group
in the department, who is dedicated to the dissection
of the molecular pathway controlling seed dormancy.
The Max Planck Institute oﬀers an outstanding envi-
ronment for carrying out ambitious and innovative re-
search. The Department of Genetics and Plant Breed-
ing brings together plant molecular biologists, quanti-
tative geneticists and evolutionary biologists to investi-
gate the causes and consequences of plant natural vari-
ation. The Institute beneﬁts from a superb interdisci-
plinary scientiﬁc community, with world class molecular
biology being performed and active contacts with out-
standing evolutionary geneticists located in the nearby
University of Cologne. This position is part of SFB680,
a research network on the molecular basis of evolution-
ary innovations, which is funded since January 2006 by
DFG, the german research funding agency.
Living in Cologne Cologne, the metropolis on the
Rhine, has just over one million inhabitants and is the
fourth-largest city in Germany. It oﬀers plenty of cul-
tural and recreational activities. The city further ben-
eﬁts from its central location in the European travel
network. Trains go directly from downtown Cologne to
Frankfurt International Airport. Low cost air compa-nies operate at the local airport (K¨ oln-Bonn) and can
take you anywhere in Europe in a couple of hours.
Applicants are encouraged to consult the Insti-
tute/Departmental websites at http://www.mpiz-

diately and continue until the position is ﬁlled. Please
provide a cover letter, curriculum vitae and contact in-
formation for two referees and submit to: Juliette de

Hannover EvolMouseLemurs
A PhD Position is available in the ﬁeld of Behavioural
Ecology at the Institute of Zoology at the Stiftung
Tier¨ arztliche Hochschule Hannover, Germany
Topic: Comparative feeding ecology of mouse lemurs
(Microcebus spp.) in northwest Madagascar
The feeding ecology of species inﬂuences their ecologi-
cal plasticity, may determine population densities and
forms one important ecological basis for species coex-
istence. This project aims to test various ecological
hypotheses and predictions by focussing on two mouse
lemur species in zones of sympatry and allopatry. The
main part of the project consists of ﬁeld work, but sub-
sequent lab work will also be included. The project is
funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.
We seek a highly motivated and scientiﬁcally creative
graduate student willing to conduct two long ﬁeld trips
(up to 10 months duration) to the Ankarafantsika Na-
tional Park under demanding tropical working condi-
tions. The student should have previous experience
in animal behaviour, a theoretical and practical back-
ground in evolutionary ecology, as well as practical ex-
perience in working with and handling free-living ani-
mals (ideally primates or small mammals).
Methods employed in the ﬁeld will include behavioural
observations and experiments, radiotelemetry, capture-
recapture techniques, vegetation analyses (e.g., phe-
nology, food composition and distribution), and faecal

PhD position available (38 hours a week)
in the section Plant Ecology of the Institute of Biology
(IBL) of Leiden University, for the project:
Biological invasions: The result of a fast evolution in
new environments?
Senecio jacobaea is introduced introduction into Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and the west coast of North Amer-
ica where it is a noxious weed. Previous research
strongly suggests that a fast adaptive evolution towards
a more weedy habit in S. jacobaea plants took place
upon introduction. However, for a proper analysis of
adaptive changes upon introductions the source popu-
lations of the native area need to be compared with the
introduced environments. The candidate will therefore
ﬁrst focus on ﬁnding the source population(s) in the
native area and reconstructing the path of introduction
of S. jacobaea in Australia, New Zealand and North
America with the aid of molecular techniques such as
AFLP, microsatellites and TILLING.To ﬁnd evidence for a fast evolution upon introduc-
tions the source populations will be compared with the
invasive populations in common garden experiments
with regard to anti-herbivore-, growth and reproduc-
tion characteristics. Bioassays will be performed with
a number of specialist and generalist herbivores.
Genetic variation in the traits of interest will be com-
pared to genetic variation in neutral molecular markers
to correct for bottlenecks.
Requirements: The candidate must have a degree
(Drs./MSc) in biology or a related study and have a
strong interest as well as expertise in evolutionary and
molecular biology.
The appointment is for a period of 4 years and is ex-
pected to lead to the completion of a dissertation. The
gross monthly salary is 1.877 in the ﬁrst year and in-
creases progressively each year to 2.407 in the fourth
year. Salary and fringe beneﬁts conform to the Col-
lective Employment Agreement for Dutch Universities.

Vacancy number CL-PDI-06304
Who will be appointed on the project Arctic breed-
ing waterfowl as vectors for avian inﬂuenza viruses.
This project, supported by the Dutch science founda-
tion (NWO) in the framework of the International Polar
Year, will be conducted in close co-operation with the
department of Virology of Erasmus University - Rot-
terdam, Veterinary Medicine - Utrecht University, and
Arctic Centre - Groningen University.
Project description: Inﬂuenza virus (IV) outbreaks
pose a major threat to human and animal health and
the economy. Various data indicate that Arctic breed-
ing migratory waterbirds, notably Anseriformes and
Charadriiformes species, are a reservoir and vector for
IV. With its dense human population, extensive pig and
chicken farming (with increasing outdoor ranging), its
many shallow water bodies that attract migratory wa-
terfowl in unparalleled numbers, The Netherlands form
a European hot spot for inﬂuenza outbreaks in poul-
try and potential transmission to man. For risk reduc-
tion, early recognition and management of outbreaks,
the proposed multidisciplinary research initiative will
provide critical knowledge on: (1) what species of Arc-
tic breeding waterbirds are carriers of avian IV and how
this correlates with speciﬁc ecological features of the
species, (2) the spatial and temporal variation in IV
prevalence among these species, (3) which individuals
are most susceptible for IV infection and how it impacts
their ﬁtness and (4) the role of Arctic moulting ponds as
reservoirs for avian IV. We envisage a multidisciplinary
research project covering the ﬁelds of bird ecology, vi-
rology and epidemiology. Using a ﬂyway approach,
IV prevalence and bird ﬁtness and behaviour will be
monitored at a high spatial and temporal resolution in
various populations of waterfowl, all in order to eluci-
date the interactions between Arctic breeding birds and
IV. The full project description can be obtained from:

PDRA and PhD Positions, Division of Environmental

Mating systems and genetic diversity in Arabidopsis
lyrata20 EvolDir September 1, 2006
A Postdoctoral Research Assistantship is available on a
NERC-funded (British Natural Environment Research
Council) project concerned with evaluating how the
mating “decisions” that plants make aﬀect their po-
tential to respond to environmental change, as a result
of changes in genetic diversity resulting from diﬀerent
levels of inbreeding. This project will address this ques-
tion by examining naturally occurring populations of a
species that is normally outcrossing (i.e., is only able to
breed with unrelated individuals), but for which pop-
ulations have been identiﬁed that have experienced a
change in the genetic machinery required to maintain
this mating strategy. The study will examine variation
in: 1) genes that are directly involved in controlling
rates of outcrossing; 2) genes that are in physical prox-
imity to these gene regions; and 3) unrelated reference
loci that can be used to test population genetics models
about changes in demographic attributes of populations
in relation to breeding systems.
The objectives of a tied PhD studentship will be to
test hypotheses about when the shift in mating sys-
tem occurred in relation to post-glacial colonization and
to examine mechanisms for loss of self-incompatibility
through controlled pollination and transformation ex-
periments.
Since the plants used in this study are restricted to
habitats that have been fragmented as a result of hu-
man population growth, the study could have impli-
cations for predicting how changes in breeding strate-
gies will inﬂuence the ability of populations to adapt to
changes in population size or restriction of migration
between populations as a result of human activities.
Eligibility: The PDRA is open to all qualiﬁed appli-
cants but the PhD position is restricted to UK residents
(EU nationals are eligible only if they have worked or
studied in the UK for a period of 3 years or more).

UJvaskyla GeneticVariability
One PhD Position on the maintenance of genetic vari-
ability in animals with asexual reproduction is avail-
able at the University of Jyv¨ askyl¨ a, Finland under
the supervision of Johanna Mappes, Jukka Jokela and
Alessandro Grapputo.
Starting: 2006. Funded by Academy of Finland for 4
years
The main theme of the project is targeted at investi-
gating how parthenogenetic animals can maintain high
genetic variability and compete with sexual relatives.
All theories on the evolution and maintenance of sex
have been based on the comparison between sexual and
clonal parthenogenetic reproduction.* *However, asex-
ual reproduction is not always clonal, but can involve
meiosis and recombination as in automictic thelytoky,a form of parthenogenesis occurring in many insects.
Automictic parthenogenetic species should have the ad-
vantage of avoiding the cost of sex and, at the same
time, enjoy the advantages of genetic diversity through
recombination and decrease the mutational load, mak-
ing sex even more paradoxical. Recently, it has also
been theoretically shown that the viability of popula-
tions with automictic parthenogenesis and central fu-
sion increases with increasing rates of recombination.
We are investigating the population structure of sexual
and parthenogenetic lineages, the genetic erosion within
single parthenogenetic lineages and if parthenogenetic
lineages have higher rate of recombination than sexual
lineages. The position will involve both ﬁeld and labo-

THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF AGING
A PhD studentship, concerning the ecology and evo-
lution of aging, is available from October 2006 for an
applicant from the UK or EU, under the supervision
of Dr. Steven Sait and Dr. Ian Hope at The Univer-
sity of Leeds and Dr. Mike Boots at the University of
Sheﬃeld.
BACKGROUND The evolution of ageing remains one
of the most challenging of research topics today. Theory
predicts that populations experiencing high mortality
due to external factors (e.g. from disease or compe-
tition) evolve earlier maturity and invest more in re-
production. Theory also assumes that individuals are
equally vulnerable to external mortality. However, it
has recently been demonstrated that the pattern of age-
ing evolution is sensitive to complexities associated with
age-dependent vulnerability to mortality. The project
will investigate the feedback between the individual and
the population in variable environments and explore the
impact of contrasting selection pressures on the evolu-
tion of ageing.
The project takes place within the context of vibrant
and diverse research on ecology, evolution, genetics and
genomics. In addition to the postgraduate training pro-
gramme, the student would receive training in molec-
ular and genomics approaches, including their appli-
cation in ecology and evolution, as well as opportuni-
ties to develop models and theory with collaborators at
Sheﬃeld. The student would become familiar with ex-
perimental design and complex statistical analyses, as
well the presentation of results to a variety of audiences
and in a variety of formats. This broad research experi-
ence will beneﬁt further by extensive interactions with
two other related PhD projects and partners at Sheﬃeld
and York within a White Rose-funded network.
Informal enquiries can be made to Dr. Steven
Sait (s.m.sait@leeds.ac.uk) and Prof. Tim Benton
(t.g.benton@leeds.ac.uk).

able at: http://www.leeds.ac.uk/rds/schol/wrs-

University http://www.genetik.uu.se/ One PhD po-
sition is available at the Department of Evolutionary
Functional Genomics at Uppsala University starting au-
tumn 2006. The department is part of the Evolution-
ary Biology Centre, EBC. A major focus of the depart-
ment is the genetic basis of plant adaptation, combin-
ing information on gene function from model organisms
with studies of variation in adaptive traits in diﬀerent
species. The aim is to identify genes that aﬀect varia-
tion in traits such as ﬂowering time and growth rhythm.
Our strategy is to integrate traditional ecological and
phylogeographic studies with genomics and population
genetics, at both theoretical and experimental levels.
The successful applicant will take part in a project on
evolutionary and functional genomics of adaptive traits
in Norway spruce (Picea abies). The timing of budset
in Norway spruce is a trait with high adaptive value.
The trait has been extensively studied in quantitative
genetic studies that have revealed a strong clinal vari-
ation and that a large part of the variation is under
genetic control. The aim of the present project is to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling bud set,
and to identify the genes that control the adaptive cli-
nal variation for this trait. The general strategy is to
combine functional studies of already identiﬁed candi-
date genes in Norway spruce and model species with
association mapping experiments on the same genes in
Norway spruce. Methods include gene expression stud-
ies, transformation of Norway spruce and Arabidop-
sis, analysis of DNA sequence variation, SNP genotyp-
ing and association mapping. The current project will
mainly focus on functional characterization of candi-
date genes through expression and transformation ex-
periments. The work will be conducted within a re-
search group of currently 5 persons with both national
(SLU) and international (Canada, Italy) cooperation.
We are looking for an applicant with a strong interest
in molecular plant biology and evolutionary genetics.
A Bachelor of Science or equivalent in molecular biol-
ogy, genomics, genetics or a related subject is required
and experience in molecular genetics (for example DNA
sequencing, QTL mapping, RNA work or plant trans-
formation) and bioinformatics is an advantage.
The application should include curriculum vitae, de-
gree certiﬁcate, references, a short description of the
applicant and his / her experience.

˜john.stireman Project summary
Adaptive radiation has long been a central theme in
evolutionary biology and this selection driven process
is thought to be a fundamental engine of biological
diversiﬁcation. Recent years have seen a tremendous
growth in empirical studies and synthetic reviews of
the subject. Our proposed work, however, addresses
an important shortcoming: there are almost no stud-
ies of how species interactions other than competition
promote or hinder adaptive radiation. In particular,
there is a dearth of studies examining how trophic in-
teractions among species spur or inhibit adaptive di-
versiﬁcation. Given that most species are embedded
in complex ecological networks encompassing multiple
trophic and/or symbiotic interactions, the shortage of
work in this area means we currently lack data of gen-
eral signiﬁcance, essential to ground-truth new theory
and predictions concerning the causes and processes of
adaptive radiation and biological diversiﬁcation.
The focus of the proposed work is the pattern and pro-
cess of adaptive radiation in a multi-trophic commu-
nity context. Preliminary evidence suggests that the
gall midge Asteromyia carbonifera and its fungal as-
sociate (Botryosphaeria sp.) are undergoing an incipi-
ent, rapid radiation on their goldenrod (Solidago spp.)
hosts. Furthermore, the midges suﬀer extraordinarily
high rates of parasitism by hymenopteran parasitoids,
the distribution of which suggests that these enemies
may inﬂuence adaptive divergence of their midge hosts.
We will focus on understanding how adaptive radiation
in this system is inﬂuenced by geography, interactions
between mutualists, and interactions between trophic
levels. We propose to employ genetic analyses (e.g.,
DNA sequencing, AFLPs, microsatellites) and labora-
tory/ﬁeld studies to reconstruct the recent history and
ongoing population genetic and ecological processes in-
volved in radiation of the midge-fungus species com-
plexes.
Cecidomyiid gall midges have long attracted attention
for their phenomenal taxonomic and ecological diver-
sity. The proposed work will enable a detailed dissec-26 EvolDir September 1, 2006
tion of the patterns and processes of gall midge diver-
siﬁcation in its earliest stages. Most importantly, the
work will provide a tractable model for exploring how
adaptive divergence in complex ecological systems is
inﬂuenced by hosts, mutualists, natural enemies, and
their interactions.John O. Stireman III Assistant Professor Department of

CollegeCharleston Bioinformatics
Applications and nominations are invited for the En-
dowed Professorship in Bioinformatics at the College of
Charleston. This is one of two endowed appointments
to be made within the Center for Economic Excellence
in Marine Genomics being developed in partnership be-
tween the College of Charleston and the Medical Uni-
versity of South Carolina. It is anticipated that the
appointment will be made at the level of Associate Pro-
fessor or Professor in the Department of Biology at the
College (see www.cofc.edu/˜biology ) and this position
will carry a joint appointment with the Medical Uni-
versity of South Carolina.
The successful applicant will have a demonstrated trackrecord as a scholar in a collaborative and collegial set-
ting, a strong commitment to teaching at all levels and
to mentoring both graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents, and, ideally, will also have signiﬁcant experi-
ence with the mechanisms for enhancing research value
through economic development (e.g., intellectual prop-
erty, interaction with relevant industries, translational
research activities, etc.). Experience as a research team
leader or as a research program director is highly desir-
able.
The individual appointed will be expected to pro-
vide academic and program leadership to the Bioin-
formatics Group within the Marine Genomics Program
in Charleston and to interact with the newly estab-
lished Discovery Informatics program at the College of
Charleston. The appointee will be expected to develop
or enhance a strong extramurally funded research pro-
gram in bioinformatics, especially as applied to marineSeptember 1, 2006 EvolDir 27
genomics, mentor graduate students, teach courses in
their area of expertise, and promote economic initia-
tives related to their research that could assist relevant
stakeholders.
The Marine Genomics Program is an integrated, highly
collaborative eﬀort that brings together over 40 faculty,
students and staﬀ from the College of Charleston, the
Medical University of South Carolina, the SC Depart-
ment of Natural Resources, and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology (both agencies
of the U.S. Department of Commerce) on the Fort
Johnson Marine campus, ﬁve miles from downtown
Charleston. In addition to these Charleston-based
agencies, the Marine Genomics program has a strong
network of contacts and collaborations regionally, na-
tionally and internationally. The Marine Genomics pro-
gram is focused on applying the power of genomic ap-
proaches to increasing understanding of the interactions
of marine organisms with their environment, including
infectious diseases, and the relationship between the
oceans and human health. Historic Charleston SC, with
its location on the biologically very diverse southeast
Atlantic marsh, is a natural and beautiful surrounding
for articulating a globally driven eﬀort to monitor, un-
derstand, protect and manage the marine environment.
The current Marine Genomics Program bioinformat-
ics infrastructure ( http://marinegenomics.org, see also
BML Genomics 2005, 6:34) includes cDNA and RNA
sequence information for over 20 species, working as
a clearing-house maintaining over 60,000 sequence en-
tries, and with both databases increasingly rapidly. In
the past year, the bioinformatics research and develop-
ment eﬀorts have added a strong focus on expression
data to assist in the design of microarrays for the in-
house production facility and the subsequent acquisi-
tion and analysis of microarray hybridization data (see
publications in the Marine Genomics Program URL).
This is a unique opportunity for both fundamental and
applied advances as the Marine Genomics Program and
its worldwide network of associates are starting to use
these microarrays beyond in vitro experimentation, and
increasingly as tools for experimental ﬁeld biology. The
bioinformatic component of this initiative has been de-
scribed as a biosensor calibration exercise (Compara-
tive and Functional Genomics, 6(3):132-137(6)) which
creates the opportunity for fundamental advances in
systems biology by correlating the transcriptomic infor-
mation with metabolic, regulatory and signaling infor-
mation. A marine proteomics component is emerging
that will reinforce the ability to move towards systemic
approaches to marine biology.
The successful candidate will coordinate an existingteam of programmers and computational biologists and
will drive the conceptual and theoretical interpretation
of the experimental results. The Bioinformatics eﬀort
is conﬁgured as an active member of the open source
community and as such is driven towards publication
of results, dissemination of open source software tools
and articulation of the data repositories with public re-
sources such as those maintained by NCBI and EMBL.
Accordingly, the computing infrastructure is based on
Linux blade servers and the tools

of a placenta has evolved at least six times within the
family. There are often close relatives that either lack
a placenta or have a placenta in intermediate stages of
development. The lab work on live ﬁsh includes gener-

Project Summary: An unanswered question in biology
is how do complex traits evolve?. This question endures
as an area of controversy because of a paucity of em-
pirical evidence and because the process unfolds on a
time scale that is far longer than human experience. We
propose developing a model system for the evolution of
complexity by studying the evolution of the placenta
in the ﬁsh subfamily Poeciliinae. This group of ﬁsh
oﬀers a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
complexity because placental adaptation exhibits: 1)
dynamic variation: placentas appear to have evolved
ﬁve or more times in the family, 2) serial variation:
in several cases, closely related species exhibit either
no placentas, intermediate stages, or highly developed
placentas, and 3) quantitative variation: an objective
criterion for pre- versus post-fertilization maternal pro-
visioning exists which provides an index of placental
performance. Furthermore, these ﬁsh are readily reared
and bred in captivity, are easily studied in nature, and
have an excellent prior history as subjects in labora-
tory and ﬁeld studies. Here we will use a combination
of molecular and morphological systematics to deﬁne
relationships within the subfamily and the relation of
the subfamily to the remainder of its order. We will
describe the life histories of these ﬁsh so that we can
combine life history and phylogeny data, then apply
statistical methods that will allow us to infer the pat-
terns of evolution of life histories in the subfamily. We
will also use these methods to develop hypotheses for
how and why the placenta evolved. Finally, we propose
a series of laboratory experiments that test predictions

UPoitiers 2 EvolEcol
Two permanent positions in EVOLUTIONARY
ECOLOGY will be available at the University of
Poitiers <http://www.univ-poitiers.fr > starting
September 2007.
We seek to ﬁll two permanent positions at the PRO-FESSOR (senior researcher) and ASSISTANT PRO-
FESSOR (junior researcher) level in Evolutionary Ecol-
ogy in the joint research unit (UMR) GBPC (Popula-
tion Biology and Genetics of Crustaceans, D. Bouchon)
of the University of Poitiers (France).
The unit is composed of 11 permanent researchers, 5
PhD students and a technical staﬀ of 7 technicians.
From a 30 year-old experience on Wolbachia-isopod in-
teractions, the unit collects, maintains and distributes
an unique collection of terrestrial isopods genetically
controlled (some of them harbouring diﬀerent strains
of Wolbachia). We are involved in the European con-
sortium EUWOL(FP5 2000-2004) leading to the com-
plete genome sequence of the feminizing Wolbachia of
Armadillidium vulgare (wVulC) which is under annota-
tion. We also coordinate the ENDOSYMBART project
(ANR 2006-2009) from the National Research Agency,
dealing with the study of symbiosis in arthropods. We
also investigated the use of crustaceans (both terres-
trial and aquatic) as indicators of biodiversity in en-
vironmental management. We coordinate the Euro-
pean thematic network CRAYNET <http://labo.univ-
poitiers.fr/craynet/ >managing, protecting and moni-
toring the European native crayﬁsh populations.
The ideal candidates work in the ﬁeld of evolutionary
ecology. Interest in using arthropods as a model and ex-
perience in molecular techniques is advantageous. We
expect willingness to collaborate with others in the
group and to contribute to its teaching commitments.
Teaching responsibilities entail introductory courses for
1st year students and specialized courses in our grad-
uate program in ecology and evolutionary biology. In-
troductory courses must be taught in French.
As French regulations require that the candidates
need to register for a ’liste de qualiﬁcation’ from
the National Council of Universities, the present
application is set up in two stages: - Qualiﬁcation:
* the applications will be assessed by disciplinary
committees at the national level from 11 September
2006 to 16 October 2006. Note that the relevant com-
mittee in the case of ecology and evolution is the so
called CNU section 67 (Population Biology and Ecol-
ogy). For further information and online application
see <http://www.education.gouv.fr/personnel/-

ABIBigDye vs GEET-terminators
Dear Evoldir members,
I’m in the process of developing microsatellites.
I’m using ET-terminators on a Megabace 1000. Even
though I’m using terminators at full strength, the se-
quences gets bad (even) after a short repetitive se-
quence. The inserted fragments vary around 500bp.
From what I’ve heard, ABI BigDye 3.1 is supposed to
work better on repetitive fragments.
I would appreciate your experience running BigDye on
a Megabace. How much can I safely dilute the termi-nator mix? What run parameters do you recommend?
Thanks, Peter Halvarsson PhD student, Uppsala Uni-
versity, Sweden

IDH reaction)? B) a reasonable substitute that will
work instead? C) a protocol for synthesizing isocitrate
from upstream product using aconitase?
We have used the dl-isocitric acid trisodium salt version
of this substrate from Sigma, but seems now as if there
is a world-wide shortage indeﬁnitely.

NocturalMorphology
Hi all,
I have two questions that I’m hoping someone can help
with.
1. We are studying golden hamsters in the wild (south-
ern Turkey), and want to get a camera down into bur-
rows to record activity. The burrow entrances are ~4.5
cm in diameter, and tunnels can be up to 200 cm in
length (sometimes longer), with a sharp turn into the
nest chamber. Therefore, we need something small,
works in low (no) light, and is maneuverable (i.e. can
turn corners).
Does something like this exist? Any information would
be most appreciated.
2. Are there any published data on typical eye:ear,
eye:skull and/or ear:skull size ratios for nocturnal vs
diurnal rodents? (or any other taxa, for that matter...).
Quick google and web of science searches yielded noth-
ing that directly addresses this question.
Thanks for your help. Feel free to answer me directly,
and if folks are interested, I’ll post a summary of re-
sponses.

Dear Members of the ASN, SSB, and SSE,
The Joint Council of the three evolution societies has
recently appointed the three of us to a standing com-
mittee to deal with the ever-present threat of creation-
ism and intelligent design to the teaching and funding
of evolutionary biology in the US.
The goals of the committee are spelled out in the at-
tached documents, and this message is to let the mem-
bership know of the existence of the committee, as well
as to ask for suggestions and help from the membership.
The committee will work together with the education
section of SSE, which has already been active in this
area for several years, as well as with the premier orga-
nization promoting education about evolution and cre-
ationism, the National Center for Science Education.
As a ﬁrst action item, we would like the mem-
bers of the three societies to be aware of an immi-
nent threat in the states of Texas and Kansas (see,
for example, http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060707/-
sﬀ022.html?.v=56 ). We encourage everyone to get in-
volved and fully participate in their local and state
school deliberations over these issues. Local mem-
bers could contact the National Center for Science Ed-
ucation ( http://www.ncseweb.org/default.asp ) and let
them know that they can call upon members in case of
hearings or other public appearances related to the two
cases. Also, individual members wishing to get involved
and/or make ﬁnancial donations can obtain more in-
formation from Texas Citizens for Science ( http://-

Continuous PAUP data
while exploring how to use some continuous data for
systematics I have found some trouble. Following
PAUP user manual you can use 16, 32, or up to 64
character states for a character in your matrix (if you
are using a 16, 32, or 64 bits machine computer re-
spectivey)... but when you have a matrix with with
polymorphisms ( i.e.: 1/2) how can you make PAUP
undersands it as a diﬀerent state than the state No. 12
for example?....
if you are using brackets in your matrix your polymor-
phism should be (12) and your twelve state should be
the same (12) or if you are using codes in your ma-
trix they will also converge: x = 1/2 and b = 12, the
program will say that x and b are the same (12).
any feedback on this?....... maybe is it better avoid-
ing this and using those methods (i.e.: Thiele gap-
weighting) to convert all continuous data?
thank you very much... cheers, Diego.

Duplexing ABI sequences
We are experiencing a bizzare phenomenon on some
sequences generated by our ABI377. We are getting
sequences that appear to be duplexes of themselves.
We are amplifying a 400bp fragment of mtDNA control
region and recover clean, single bands. One of our se-
quencing primers gives us a good clean 400bp sequence.
The other gives us an ~800bp sequence: a good clean
400bp sequence that is followed by a semiclean to messy
reverse compliment of the ﬁrst 400bp.
Other sequences run on the sequencer are ﬁne and have
no problems. It’s only the one direction of this frag-
ment that has an issue. Given that we experience this
phenomenon in only one sequencing direction and that
the PCR products are completely clean with only a
single band, it is clear that this must be a sequencing
artifact of some sort. However the PCR and sequenc-
ing stocks that we are using are the same, and we haveroutinely sequenced this gene region from these species
for the past several weeks without issue. I’m stumped
as to what might be the cause or the solution to this
problem.
I have called ABI tech support and they were com-
pletely unhelpful, as expected.
Has anyone out there ever experienced anything simi-
lar?

EtOHpreservation pHBuﬀering
answers
In reply to the query: —————————– Does any-
one use buﬀered 70% - 90% ethanol for the preservation
of specimens for DNA-based work and, if so, with what
recipe, rationale and results? —————————–
I received several replies (not listed) from readers who
thought that buﬀering ethanol would be a sensible and
logical procedure but who had no actual experience to
contribute. There were two replies from people who do
buﬀer their ethanol, as follows:
1. From: “Joe Staton” <JStaton@gwm.sc.edu >
We used to add about 0.1 ml of 1/10x TE (pH 8.0) to
help with this. I think Tim Collins taught me this. As
I understand it, many inverts release acids when pre-
served which leads to DNA destruction. Others I know
change out the EtOH after 3 days to help with the same
problem.
and 2. From: “Blair Hedges” <sbh1@psu.edu >
I usually buﬀer my 70-80% ethanol for specimen/DNA
preservation (of reptiles and amphibians) with TE (Tris
EDTA) pH 8.0. I buy 100X concentrate from Sigma
and bring the concentration up to 1X TE, although for
large volumes (liters) it may be a weaker TE concen-
tration. My reason for doing so is not so much for pH
but simply as a proven DNA buﬀer. Also, I use 151
proof rum (75% ethanol) instead of laboratory grade
ethanol because the latter sometimes includes a touch
of methanol which could harm DNA. I work in the West
Indies so the rum is easy to get.
—————————
My conclusion is that buﬀering the ethanol is a sen-
sible precaution that may be particularly valuable for
calcite-shelled animals and I intend in future to dilute
ethanol with 1 x TE rather than water.
To Blair Hedges’ reasons for using rum I will mention
my experience of methanol-denatured ethanol. This is
the standard shipboard ﬁxative for the brachiopods I
receive from the IRD/ORSTOM Paciﬁc sampling cam-
paigns, and brachiopods preserved in this have yielded
ampliﬁable DNA after a decade or so at -20. The only
diﬃculty so far has been with some crinoids that con-
tain quinone pigments. These (I assume) converted the
10% methanol to formaldehyde, the vapour of whichcaught me unawares when repacking the specimens in
an enclosed, hot environment..
Thank you all.

Geneious API
To encourage the integration and sharing of open source
applications for phylogenetics, sequence alignment, and
evolutionary bioinformatics with the community, there
is a now public API for Geneious. The public API al-
lows any tools, new or existing, to use Geneious (which
is free for academic use) an an organization and visual-
ization front-end . The beneﬁt of this is that a number
of tools can be accessed from the same framework, and
run across any operating system. It also means as a de-
veloper that you don’t have to write the GUI yourself.
You can see the Geneious API by going to
www.geneious.com, or by clicking directly on this link
http://www.geneious.com/assets/ developer/geneious-
api-2.0.zip
To develop code that uses the public API, you will need
to download Geneious 2.0.1, which is also freely avail-
able from the website and has some new features includ-
ing improvements to local sequence similarity search
Any feedback on the API or Geneious is welcome

Morphometric software
Hello Evoldir,
I’m looking for free software for a PC that can take
a digital photograph of a butterﬂy wing, allow me to
select diﬀerent points on the wing, as well as a cali-
brated length, then will calculate the distance among
the points as I choose. Hopefully this would be saved
in some sort of tab delimited format.
I’ve found several programs on the web that allow me
to calibrate a length and perform a distance measure,
but on a line by line basis. What I really want is to be
able to put 4 points on an image, calibrate the length
on the image, and have the program give me back dis-
tances among the points, and perhaps even area among
the points. I have many wing photos to go through.
Thanks for any suggestions/help

PAML dNdSDear EvolDir members,
I work on complete genome of two species with 70% of
homology in amino acid. Some people say that I’m at
the limit to use PAML and that I may have substitu-
tion saturation. I work with the 3.15 PAML version
(novembre 2005). I ﬁrst run a pairwise analysis run-
mode = -2 (because I run 2 aligned sequences at once).
I run about six thousand pair of aligned sequences (but
one pair at once). Unfortunatly, I found a very high dS
value ( >50) for the main part of my sequences. So, the
results have no real meaning. I try with runmode =
2 (autmoatic analysis) to test diﬀerent model of evolu-
tion (NSsites). I run PAML wih NSsites = 2 (selection
model, M2a). I obtained some results but I don’t un-
derstand what they represent. For example I obtained
at the end of the main output ﬁle :
“stage 0: (1, 2); lnL(ntime: 2 np: 7): -1079.894991
3..1 3..2 19.54493 19.55404 7.33163 -0.20254 -1.62772
0.00344 37.70754”
Is some one abble to tell me what represent the dif-
ferent values ? Could you help me to understand the
PAML results ? Maybe I use the bad parameters ?

Plotting morph characters
Dear Evoldir members,
I am a PhD student working on African Annonaceae
phylogeny.
I would like to plot morphological characters on a
GENERIC level molecular phylogeny using Bayesian
methods. I have 2-3 species per genus. My main focus
is at the generic level and I am looking at characters
that are constant in the genus. However, sometimes one
species out of them all presents an alternative state...
So my question is the following: How does one deal with
polymorphic states if the unique species presenting the
alternative “rare” state was not sampled (for whatever
reason)?
I give a quick example to illustrate the question: 1 genus
with 15 species. 3 species have been sampled. Charac-
ter A has two states ’0’ and ’1’. 14 species have state
’0’ (including the 3 species in my phylogeny), and one
species has state ’1’. If this later spcies is not sam-
pled how do I deal with this alternative state in my
phylogeny?
For me there are three alternatives: - Leave one species
in representing the genus and code this character as
“uncertain” or ’0/1’: in this case I would be giving too
much importance to this unique alternative state, no?
- Leave the three species in and code them accordingly
(so in the example code them as 0) and say that the
alternative state (1) is exceptional: in this case I would
be ignoring an alternative state present in the genus....
- Do not plot this character as I do not have the appro-
priate sampling.
Any comments, reference to publications dealing with
the same problem, alternative methods for analysing
the data, etc would be very much appreciated,
Best regards,

SMARTGrants miss EvolBiol
US Department of Education ’overlooks’ evolution
* 12:28 24 August 2006 * NewScientist.com news ser-
vice * Celeste Biever
<http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/-
cms/dn9832/dn9832-1 817.jpg > Why has Evolu-
tionary Biology disappeared from the Department of
Education’s list?
Evolutionary biology is mysteriously missing from the
list of undergraduate subjects eligible for a US federal
grant.
The department of education claims the omission is
simply a mistake and insists that US students taking
evolutionary biology majors are eligible for the grants.
However, the incident has left pro-evolution campaign-
ers wondering whether evolutionary biology was delib-
erately eliminated from the list by people who ﬁnd Dar-
winian evolution impossible to reconcile with their own
religious beliefs.
“I have reason to believe there is a serious problem
here,” physicist Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Re-
serve University in Cleveland, Ohio, told New Scientist.
Krauss wrote a story in the New York
Times <http://select.nytimes.com/gst/-
abstract.html?res˜ o0A15FA3C5A0C768DDDA10894DE404482 >on 15 August warning of the dangers
that anti-evolutionist school board members pose
to science education. The day after his story was
published, a “Washington DC source”, who Krauss
declined to name, alerted him to the department of
education’s omission.
Krauss emailed the US Department of Education (DoE)
the next day and alerted The Chronicle of Higher
Education, which brought the incident to public at-
tention <http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=-
v6pywllczrz22q3ybkb4b94qrx35ck r7>on 22 August.
Peculiar omission
The grants in question are known as National Science
and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent or SMART
grants and are available to undergraduates at US uni-
versities studying mathematics, science technology, en-
gineering and “critical” foreign languages. The DoE
is oﬀering them for the ﬁrst time this year in order to
encourage students “to pursue college majors in high
demand in the global economy”.
A pdf document on the DoE’s website <http:/-
/www.ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/-
GEN0606A.pdf >lists the hundreds of eligible majors,
which include a variety of subjects from Artiﬁcial
Intelligence and Robotics to Conservation Biology to
Organic Chemistry. But, as this article is published,
evolutionary biology is conspicuously absent.
The nature of the omission is peculiar. Each subject
is designated by a number and the list is arranged
in numerical order. Yet there is a conspicuous white
space ﬂanked by the numbers 26.1302 and 26.1304, at
the point where you would expect evolutionary biology,
which is number 26.1303, to go (see graphic, right).
“On its own, it’s not really a smoking gun,” says Glenn
Branch of the National Center for Science Education
in Berkeley, California. “But in the context of actions
that other people in the federal government have taken,
it is suspicious.”
Branch is referring to claims in February 2006 that
a NASA public relations oﬃcer muzzled climate
scientists <http://www.newscientist.com/channel/-
opinion/mg18925403.900 >who did not conform to the
Bush administration’s view.
No explanation
The DoE says the omission is a mistake that it will
correct but oﬀers no explanation for why it occurred.
“Evolutionary biology is one of a number of majors
under the ”Ecology, Evolution, Systematics and Pop-
ulation Biology“ category of majors eligible to receive
SMART grants,” says spokesperson Katherine McLane50 EvolDir September 1, 2006
in a public statement.
“There is no explanation for it being left oﬀ of the list -
it has always been an eligible major. The department is
making the necessary correction which will be in place
before ﬁnal guidance on AC/SMART grants is issued.”
Two other subjects - Heating Ventilation and Air Con-
ditioning Technology and Exercise Physiology - are also
missing from the list. If the omissions were deliberate,
it is unclear why these would also have been left out.
Unlike evolutionary biology, these subjects are not typ-
ically oﬀensive to anti-evolutionists, says Branch.

Software MrMTgui
Dear Evoldir
I am releasing version 1.0 of MrMTgui, an open source
cross-platform interface for both ModelTest and Mr-
ModelTest. This is a evolutionary step from the last
version 1.6 of MTgui with the inclusion of MrModelTest
to the interface. That’s why I am calling this version
1.0.
I am making it available at
http://www.genedrift.org
a precompiled package for Windows and the source code
that can be built on Linux (or even Windows, although
no support for it is available). The Linux source code
is a kedevelop project that can be conﬁgured and made
with ease, requiring wxWidgets to be installed. There
is no help available for the Linux version at the moment
and I am also planning to include a couple of pre-built
executables for major distros in the near future.
The source code can be checked-out with svn using:
svn co svn://svn.geekisp.com/genesoft/mtgui <desired
path>
or at
http://trac.geekisp.com/genesoft/browser Any com-
ments or problems, please let me know. I would like
to than Johan Nylander who allowed the inclusion of
MrModelTest in the interface.

Software MrMTgui rerelease
Dear EvolDir
I am re-releasing MrMTgui. Thanks to Frank Vanden-
bussche, I spotted a critical error on the installation
package that had a ﬁle missing which prevented the
executable to run.
I have repackaged the executable and uploaded a cor-September 1, 2006 EvolDir 51
rected version to the website. You can download it
directly from:
http://www.genedrift.org/ﬁles/mrmtgui.zip Please
uninstall the package that contains the error. This new
package is set to install on a diﬀerent location, so hope-
fully there will be no conﬂicts.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this mistake.
MrMTgui is open source and the new installation pack-
age contains the source code (still poorly commented)
that is located in the installation directory.
I would appreciate any feedback from users that had
the same problem running this version. I have limited
access to Windows machines (and testers) and the inter-
face, although being a relatively short program, relies
on several idiosyncrasies of the operating system that
might be diﬀerent from machine to machine.
Sorry again for any inconvenience.

Taxonomic Content Management
Systems
Dear all,
My colleagues and I at the Natural History Museum,
London are interested in reviewing the functionality
of various web based “taxonomic content management
systems” that are being used for holding and edit-
ing integrated information about taxa (e.g. specimen,
DNA, image, taxon name, etc). Speciﬁcally, we are
interested in those that have some kind of web in-
terface for presenting and (preferably) editing these
data. We know of some examples of such systems (e.g.
Orthoptera Species File, http://osf2x.orthoptera.org/;
Specify, http://www.specifysoftware.org/ etc). Indeed,
some are in development at the museum. However, we
are quite sure that are many not on our list. If you are
involved in developing or using such a system I would
appreciate a brief message about it, along with a web
link to the database. Please reply to me oﬀ list, and
if there is suﬃcient interest I’ll consolidate the results
and post them back to everybody.
Thanks for your time and apologies for cross postings,

Testing phylogenetic assumptions
Dear All,
Most phylogenetic methods assume that the alignment
of nucleotides evolved under stationary, reversible and
homogeneous conditions. If these assumptions are vi-
olated by the data, the risk of errors in phylogenetic
estimates is increased. To determine whether the se-
quences data evolved under stationary, reversible and
homogeneous conditions has, hitherto, been a bit of a
problem.
SeqVis and SymTest are programs developed to detect
whether alignments of nucleotides violate the assump-
tion of evolution under stationary, reversible and ho-
mogeneous conditions (which would be the case if the
sequences were compositionally heterogeneous). The
principles behind the methods are described in:
Bioinformatics 22, 1225-1231 [2006] Bioinformatics 22,
2162-2163 [2006]
whereas the programs are available from

Travel with DNA
Hi,52 EvolDir September 1, 2006
A colleague will be traveling from Brazil to visit me and
will be bringing some DNA samples. Does anyone have
any experience with customs in this regard? I’m won-
dering if he’ll need some letter from me or something
like that to get the samples through customs.
Thanks,

Travel with DNA answers
Sounds potentially complicated!
Here is my original question:
A colleague will be traveling from Brazil to visit me and
will be bringing some DNA samples. Does anyone have
any experience with customs in this regard? I’m won-
dering if he’ll need some letter from me or something
like that to get the samples through customs.
Thanks,
Mike
Here are the responses:
Hi Mike,
Every trip through customs can be diﬀerent, but I sug-
gest the following
1) have a copy of your permit from Brazil
2) have a letter from OSU saying who you are and what
you are doing
3) have your university ID and business cards
4) Contact the US Fish and Wildlife law enforcement
oﬃce at the airport where you will be clearing customs
before you leave to explain who you are and when you
will be returning with the samples
5) Fill out the USFWS form 3-777 and FAX or email
it to the USFWS law enforcement oﬃce where you will
be clearing customs
6) when you go through customs, show them your big
stack of paperwork and tell them that USFWS is ex-
pecting you. USFWS will then meet you and clear your
samples for importIf your stuﬀ is CITES, it’s slightly more involved.
Good luck
Paul
Hello Michael,
Your friend need permission from IBAMA (Intituto
Brasileiro de Meio Ambiente) for bring this DNA for
you. He need contact this Brasilian institution and
compleed many formularies. If he dont make this, he
and you will have big problems with federal police and
Brazil governament.

Yes, borrowing specimens from a Brazilian museum was
a big hassle, the biggest in completing my thesis. Bor-
rowing 7 specimens required me to get the signature
and “ID Number” of the vice-president of research for
my university. I believe that this paperwork was a min-
imum for removing specimens from Brazil. It could be
more diﬃcult if DNA is involved.
If you wish, I can forward you blank copies of the pa-
perwork that I completed.

Hi there,
I have traveled a couple of times with DNA samples,
both into an out of the USA, Australia, Brazil and New
Zealand. (Note this was pre 911).
When I have notiﬁed customs, I have declared it as
“non-pathogenic, non-hazardous, non living biological
material”. The key is to not put any technical terms
such as DNA etc... they will red ﬂag it.
I have also posted the DNA to myself with the same
label as above which has also been ﬁne and less stress...
Hope this helps

Hi Mike,
I’ve brought tissue samples back from Venezuela and
Brazil before. The hard part is having permits to re-September 1, 2006 EvolDir 53
move the tissues from Brazil, but the US customs peo-
ple have never seemed to care. Depending on who
he encounters, Customs, FDA, or Fish & Wildlife,
they may request to see a letter or the permit from
Brazil, but since the tissues are inert (preserved) there
shouldn’t technically be any problem. I’ve never car-
ried any letters except from the country of origin, and
I’ve never been asked for them. Just to save the has-
sle, however, I wouldn’t recommend that he declare the
tissues; why create a headache?
~Stu Willis
Hi Mike!
Be very careful with this. You will get lots of advice,
but be warned that it depends not only on the taxon
but also on the airport point of entry.
I’ve never had problems with frog samples by coming in
through Miami or even Newark, and brining a USF&W
form 3-177 already ﬁlled out in advance, plus copies
of collecting and export permits, PLUS calling ahead
to the airport to let them know when I am coming in
so they can have someone there waiting from Fish &
Wildlife.
more info:
http://www.fws.gov/permits/ImportExport/-
ImportExport.shtml
Good luck!
Hi Michael,
I am guessing your friend already has export permits,
because Brazil is really tough on this matter. They
enforce the CBD all the way.
Import permits are needed for the US. The ﬁrst I can
think of is USFWS form 3-177 ( http://www.fws.gov/-
le/pdﬃles/3-177-1.pdf ) at http://www.fws.gov/le/-
ImpExp/faqs.htm . Of course, CITES will be needed
from both ends (Brazil and USA), if the organism is on
a CITES Appendix.A letter describing the content of the samples and say-
ing who are these samples for is always good to have.
Cheers,
sergios

versity of Berne, Switzerland.
Scientists with a background education in natural
sciences (biology, ecology and related ﬁelds) are in-
vited to apply for a postdoctoral research position
opened at the Division of Conservation Biology, In-
stitute of Zoology, University of Bern, Switzerland.
Launched in 2001 this research division is active in
the ﬁelds of resource exploitation patterns (ecological
niche requirements, from foraging ecology and habi-
tat selection analysis to GIS modelling) and popula-
tion dynamics (from estimation of basic vital param-
eters to integrated models, including population vi-
ability analysis). Main research focus is on threat-
ened, emblematic species of agro-ecosystems and Alpine
ecosystems (see <http://www.conservation.unibe.ch/-
>www.conservation.unibe.ch ). There is no taxon lim-
itation in our projects within the animal realm. All
candidates with skills in scientiﬁc Conservation Biology
in the broad sense of the term will be considered, but
priority will be given to experienced researchers with
a good publication record. The tenant is expected to
contribute to the ongoing research programmes of the
division (including assistance in undergraduate teach-
ing and supervision), but will also develop his/her ﬁeld
of research. Complementary competence to the above
mentioned expertise is welcome. An ideal candidatewould for instance have speciﬁc skills and interest for
the development of genetic methods to assess dispersal
patterns in animal populations.
The position is available for up to six years, with in-
termediate evaluations every second year. A 80-100%
position would be preferred; lower employment grade
is to be discussed. Salaries will follow the schemes of
the University of Bern. Supervisors: Rapha¨ el Arlettaz
and Michael Schaub, with possible contribution by Lau-
rent Excoﬃer (Computational and Molecular Popula-
tion Genetics Lab) if the conservation genetics direction
is taken.
The successful candidate will join a research group
consisting currently of several advanced research staﬀ,
PhD- and MSc-students. Besides the Division of Con-
servation Biology and Population Genetics (Computa-
tional and Molecular Population Genetics Lab), the
Zoological Institute of the University of Bern covers
most aspects of Animal Ecology and Evolution, with
research groups in Aquatic Ecology (Ole Seehausen),
Behavioural Ecology (Michael Taborsky), Community
Ecology (Wolfgang Nentwig) and Evolutionary Ecology
(Heinz Richner).

BradyrhizobiumDiversity
A postdoc position is available in the group of Gilles
B´ ena (Evolution and Diversity of Symbioses) at the
LSTM (Laboratory of Tropical and Mediterranean
Symbioses), located at Montpellier in Southern France.
The postdoc position is about diversity and popula-
tion genomics of the photosynthetic bacteria Bradyrhi-
zobium sp. that nodulate Aeschynomene legumes. The
symbiotic couple Bradyrhizobium-Aeschinomene sensi-
tiva is extensively studied in the lab, especially the pho-
tosynthesis mechanisms, nodulation genetic bases and
eﬀect on rice growth (Plant Growth Promoting Rhi-
zobacteria).
The goals of the project are to:
-Analyse the diversity of strains of Bradyrhizobium
strains sampled on Aeschinomene sensitiva in Africa
and America, based on AFLP and MLST.
-Using full genome arrays (including the fully sequencedSeptember 1, 2006 EvolDir 57
strains ORS278 and Btai1), study genomic variations
among divergent strains (i.e. CGH approaches), detect
genomic regions subject to loss and gain and relate such
hot-spots of rearrangement to their genes content.
-Analyse the bacterial diversity regards to their eﬀects
on rice growth improvement.
The applicant must have experience of data analyses
from full genome microarray data (if possible Compar-
ative Genomic Hybridization), and a good background
in molecular biology and microbiology (bacterial cul-
ture, DNA and RNA extractions, Southern blots). The
microarray designed and experiments will be performed
by a private company, meaning that we are looking for
applicants with experience in array data analyses rather
than microarray experiments itself.
This postdoc position is available for an 18 months pe-
riod, from 1st of November 2006 to May 2008. There is
no restriction about age or citizenship. Gross salary will
be around 2000 euros net (including social security),

A post-doctoral position is anticipated starting in mid
to late September, 2006, in the Biology Department
at Penn State University. This is a one-year position
that may be extended for additional years subject to an-
nual review by the sponsor (DARPA). The proposal has
passed scientiﬁc review and presently (as of 8/29/06)
awaits ﬁnal signatures within the DOD.
Duties will involve a mixture of molecular and organ-
ismal biology: overseeing the establishment of a breed-
ing colony of a large neotropical moth, assessment of
ﬂight performance with attached payloads, association
of ﬂight and metabolic performance with genotype at
loci known to aﬀect ﬂight in other Lepidoptera, and
selection, dietary and/or hormonal manipulation to de-
liver moths with maximized ﬂight performance. The
project features collaboration with biologists and en-
gineers at Cornell and the Boyce Thompson Institute
regarding ways to control the ﬂight path of moths car-rying sensor payloads. Some ﬁeld work and interaction

A postdoctoral position is available at the University
of Reading, UK. The post is funded at GBP 25,565 for
approximately 16 months (precise details available on
request).
The subject area is in population genomics. The objec-
tive is to develop methods for analysing genome-wide
dense marker data (such as AFLPs, SNPs, or DNA se-
quence data) from multiple populations, with a view to
identifying regions of the genome that are strongly in-
ﬂuenced by selection. We are particularly interested in
genome regions where selection strongly favours diﬀer-
ent alleles in diﬀerent populations, so that local adap-
tation is maintained in the face of gene ﬂow. The sta-
tistical methods developed here will help us to make
inferences about the genetic basis of adaptation and
speciation.
We are looking for an enthusiastic biologist, who, ide-
ally, has some experience in programming and statisti-
cal analysis, and would like to learn more. We would
prefer an early start date.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITON in ECO-EVO-DEVO at
the UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD.
The endocrine basis of phenotypic plasticity in a
predator-prey system (How do hormones control preda-
tor induced defences in daphnia?)
3 year NERC (UK) Funded Position - START DATE -
Oct/Nov 2006.
Project detail Why are there so many patterns incolouration, morphology, life history and behaviour
within a particular species? Recently, developmental
biologists and ecologists have begun to join forces to an-
swer this question in the ﬁeld of ecological developmen-
tal biology (ECO-DEVO). They are asking how pheno-
typic plasticity emerges from the interplay between a
changing environment and the physiological machinery
that regulates an organisms development.
This project aims to investigate the developmental (e.g.
hormonal) basis of inducible defences in a classic water-
ﬂea (Daphnia pulex) / phantom midge (Chaoborus
spp.) predator-prey system. In this system, predator
based chemical signals induce striking adaptive mor-
phological and life history plasticity in the prey. The
interplay between invertebrate hormones such as ecdys-
teroids, juvenile hormone and other peptides is known
to regulate just these types of developmental changes
including the moult cycle and the timing of and varia-
tion in morphology, growth, maturity and development.
The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the
chemical signal that predators emit triggers an adap-
tive shift in the endocrine system, leading to adaptive
and plastic changes in prey growth and development.
The research aims to:
- identify the hormones and peptides that underpin the
induction of these adaptive, developmental changes; -
identify predator induced change in the time sequence
of hormone concentration; and - test among four hy-
pothesis for the developmental control of the induced
phenotype.
-Experience with laboratory hormone assays, inver-
tebrate physiology &/ or aquatic community ecology
will be helpful. -Application details forthcoming

To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
