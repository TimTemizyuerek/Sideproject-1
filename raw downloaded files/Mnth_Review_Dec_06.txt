MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY AND EVOLU-
TIONARY GENETICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
(MEEGID). 8th session Bangkok, Thailand, 30th
November-2nd Decembe
Still time to register ! Some slots still available for oral
presentations and posters. Deadline prolongated until
20th November.
Infectious diseases are a key model for evolutionists. It
is considered that they have been the main selective
pressure on the human species for the last 5,000 years.
Our genome has been literally scupted by this selection
process.
Coevolution between host, pathogen and vector in the
case of vector-borne diseases is one of the main scopes
of the MEEGID congress.
This is the reason why, besides its high interest for ap-
plied biomedical research (epidemiology, vaccine and
drug design), the MEEGID congress has become a ma-
jor event for evolutionists. The only congress where
you will hear of host, bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi,
all species of vectors. Of diseases of medical, veteri-
nary, agronomic relevance. Of genetics, genomics, pro-
teomics, population dynamics, evolution and bioinfor-
matics. Where you will meet specialists of all these
ﬁelds

Travel Awards for Paleoscientists in Historical Marine
Biogeography and Biodiversity
To attend the 3rd Biennial Conference of the In-
ternational Biogeography Society C asino Taoro,
Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain)http://www.biogeography.org/3rd%20conference.htm
Funding for awards is provided by Past Global
Changes (PAGES) http://www.pages-igbp.org/-
about/index.html Approximately 5 awards will be
made to promote new collaborations between paleo-
scientists, who have expertise that can elucidate the
historical processes that have contributed to modern
patterns of marine biodiversity and biogeography, and
neontologists studying those modern patterns using
molecular and organismal data. Speciﬁcally, awardees
are invited to collaborate with the six speakers in the
Maritime Connectivity symposium (see below). Col-
laborators will have the option to submit co-authored
manuscripts for publication in a peer-reviewed special
issue of the Journal of Biogeography. The long-term
goal of the awards is to stimulate initiatives that will
enhance understanding of the interaction between
paleontological and neontological processes in gener-
ating modern patterns of maritime connectivity and
therefore may elucidate the impacts of future global
changes.
The awards will cover or defray costs of attending the
meeting. Some priority will be given to young scientists
(graduates and post-docs) and/or scientists from devel-
oping countries, but more senior paleoscientists from
developed countries are also invited to apply.
Applications should include, in the following order,
(1) a cover letter, including your choice of the 2 talk
topics on which you most desire to collaborate, (2) a
500 word summary of your most relevant work, (3)
a budget request for travel, accommodation, regis-
tration, and food for the conference, plus IBS mem-
bership fee, including a statement of other fund-
ing available, and (5) your CV. Please send appli-
cations as a single PDF document titled “Applicant-
Lastname initials app.pdf” to Dr. Michael N Daw-
son<mdawson@ucmerced.edu >, and cc’d to Dr. John
P. Wares <jpwares@uga.edu >and Ms. Anuschka
Faucci <anuschka@hawaii.edu >(the symposium or-
ganizers). Please also arrange for letters of recom-
mendation from two people knowledgeable of your
work to be emailed (as PDFs titled “ApplicantLast-
name initials RecommenderLastname.pdf”) directly to
all organizers.
Applications that arrive in California later than, or are
incomplete at, 2359 hrs on 03rd December 2006 will not
be considered. Awards will be announced 15th Decem-
ber 2006. The conference dates covered by the awards
are 9th-12th January 2007 (i.e. up to 4 nights).
Symposium information:
Title: Marine Connectivity: Reconciling Models of Dis-
persal and Vicariance4 EvolDir December 1, 2006
Topic: Integrative analyses for understanding the in-
ﬂuences of past and recent (and inferred future) bio-
logical and physical processes on marine biogeography
and biodiversity, at the nexus of major initiatives such
as DIVERSITAS (bioDISCOVERY and bioGENESIS),
MarBEF, and PAGES (IMAGES).
Timescales covered: Pleistocene, Holocene, recent past,
and assessing inferences for the future
Overview: The modern distribution of marine species
has been strongly aﬀected by glacial and interglacial
events during the Pleistocene that likely promoted al-
ternating periods of vicariance and dispersal (respec-
tively). In cold temperate regions, glacial and inter-
glacial events also forced southward contraction then al-
lowed northward expansion of species ranges. Thus pe-
riods of increased isolation and range contraction alter-
nating with periods favoring dispersal and range expan-
sion have created a complex temporal and spatial mo-
saic of species histories. These histories are recorded,
in part, in patterns of genetic variation among popu-
lations and, in part, in fossil and subfossil records of
species distributions and paleoenvironments.
Our goal is to integrate molecular and paleontologi-
cal information, including paleoceanography, to under-
stand post-Pliocene factors inﬂuencing connectivity’ (a
term used here to describe the continuum from isola-
tion to panmixis) in marine taxa. A team of interna-
tional researchers will provide syntheses describing the
history of coastal and oceanic marine species including
fossil-forming taxa such as foraminifera, molluscs, and
ﬁshes, and soft-bodied invertebrates and algae. Issues
we seek to clarify include: How integrating molecular
and paleontological data improve reconstruction of the
biogeographic histories of marine species and mutually
enrich these oftentimes separate disciplines. Whether
fossil-forming taxa can act as good models for interpret-
ing the evolutionary histories of soft-bodied organisms.

StonyBrook Evol Philosophy Mar10
Stony Brook University’s Departments of Philosophy
and of Ecology & Evolution will host an informal sym-
posium on the relationship between science and philos-
ophy, on Saturday, March 10, 2007 on the SBU campus
in Stony Brook, Long Island, NY.
The idea is to explore why, if at all, scientists should
care about what philosophers say about science. Is phi-
losophy of science a discipline that should matter, how-
ever tangentially, to practicing scientists? Is it an in-
dependent area of study largely independent of science
proper? What are the various domains of scholarship
and teaching of the two disciplines, and how should
they intersect?
We encourage colleagues and graduate students in both
philosophy and any area of science to submit abstracts
for the conference, on the general theme of whether or
not philosophy can be useful to science or vice versa,
and how one would go about building bridges between
the two cultures. Selected papers will be collected in a
special issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology, a very
high-impact journal dedicated to broad conceptual is-
sues in biology.
Abstracts should be around 200-300 words, and should
be sent to massimo.pigliucci@stonybrook.edu by De-
cember 15, 2006. Authors whose abstracts will be ac-
cepted will be asked to present for about 20 minutes,
with 10 minutes of Q&A after each presentation.

lution, massimo.pigliucci@stonybrook.edu) Robert

Evolutionary Change in Human-altered Environments:
An International Summit to Translate Science into Pol-
icy Thursday, February 8, - Saturday, February 10, 2007
University of California, Los Angeles Sponsored by the
Institute of the Environment
Human activities are aﬀecting the evolutionary pro-
cesses that generate and maintain biodiversity. Climate
change and deforestation are facilitating the evolution-
ary jump of animal diseases to humans. Fish farming
has resulted in the spread of poorly adaptive genes to
the wild. Introductions of exotic species are impacting
native species and limiting their ability to adapt.
In response to this developing crisis, we are conven-
ing an international summit of evolutionary biologists,
conservation practitioners, and policy makers to syn-
thesize current knowledge and to begin to develop
plans to mitigate the eﬀects. The summit will feature
talks from more than 40 top evolutionary biologists,
poster presentations, and working groups. A central
goal of the summit is to bring the discussion beyond
academic boundaries to frame real-world solutions to
these problems. For more information, to register, go
to our website at: <http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/CTR/-
ioesymposium.html >Organized by Thomas Smith and
Louis Bernatchez.
Limited travel grants for graduate students and post-
doctoral fellows are available. Please visit our website
for more information.
There is a printable version of the symposium an-
nouncement online too!

British Ecological Society Annual Symposium
SPECIATION AND ECOLOGY
University of Sheﬃeld, 28 - 30 March 2007
Organisers: Roger Butlin, Jon Bridle and Dolph
Schluter
Biological diversity varies enormously in time and
space. Ultimately, diversity is generated by speciation
and lost by extinction. So, how much do we need to
know about the mechanisms of speciation in order to
understand patterns of diversity? Is speciation typi-
cally driven by ecological opportunity? Does this im-
ply that adaptive radiation occurs in empty environ-
ments and the rate of speciation declines as diversity
increases? Alternatively, if speciation is driven by frag-
mentation of populations or by sexual selection, how
does this interact with extinction to explain current di-10 EvolDir December 1, 2006
versity? Does speciation generate ecologically equiva-
lent units with equal probabilities of persistence?
This meeting aims to tackle these and similar ques-
tions in the light of recent advances in understanding
of speciation mechanisms and the factors that inﬂuence
speciation rates.
Invited speakers: Jody Hey, Tim Barraclough, Graham
Bell, Tom Curtis, Trevor Price, Doug Schemske, Sergey
Gavrilets, Patrik Nosil, Ole Seehausen, Jim Mallet, Dan
Funk, Bob Ricklefs, Andrew Purvis, John Alroy and

CarletonU BehaviouralEvolution
Graduate assistantships are available in behavioural
evolution in the laboratory of Dr. Sue Bertram at Car-
leton University in Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA. These
positions will begin September, 2007 (possibly Decem-
ber 2008).
I am looking for exceptional graduate students who are
broadly interested in studying insect mating behaviour
and evolution. The positions will be part of a project
aimed at understanding how variation is maintained in
traits that confer ﬁtness. Speciﬁcally, I am interested
in students who would like to pursue a research project
in one of the following three areas:
1. Social interactions inﬂuencing condition, life-history,
and sexually selected traits 2. Dietary inﬂuences on
condition, life-history, and sexually selected traits 3.
Quantitative genetics of condition, life-history, and sex-
ually selected traits
It is essential that students have high enough grades to
obtain a teaching assistantship through Carleton Uni-
versity. Students who come with their own funding
are certainly most welcome - but this is not manda-
tory. Summer salary is provided. The positions may
require travel into the United States for ﬁeld-work. As-
sistantships can be at the Masters or the PhD level,
depending on the interests, abilities, and experience of
the applicants. It may also be possible to transfer from
the Masters program into the PhD program at a later
date.
Interested persons should examine my web site
at: ( http://http- server.carleton.ca/ ~sbertram/).
They should then contact me via email at Su-
sanBertram@carleton.ca to discuss their interests
further. I would like to see a statement of interest, a
curriculum vitae, transcripts, and contact information
for faculty willing to write letters of reference. For
acceptance into the Masters or PhD program for
September 2007, students should apply to the graduate
program soon, and certainly by January 2007. Please
don’t apply to the graduate program without ﬁrst
contacting me!

the IMPRS (see link below). We are studying repro-
duction in St. John’s wort (H. perforatum), a species
which can reproduce either through sex or apomixis
(asexual reproduction through seed). One of the major
goals of my group is to decipher the underlying changes
in gene regulation which cause the switch from sexual
to apomictic seed production. The project will thus in-
volve a number of major steps, including (1) the identi-
ﬁcation of highly-expressive accessions using ﬂow cyto-
metric analyses of seeds; (2) the isolation of single egg
cells or ovules from both sexual and apomictic acces-
sions; and (3) a comparative transcriptome analysis of14 EvolDir December 1, 2006

Research Training Program in the Genetic Architecture
of Quantitative Traits
The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of
the National Institutes of Health has awarded the De-
partment of Genetics an Institutional Research Train-
ing Grant for predoctoral training in “The Genetic Ar-
chitecture of Quantitative Traits.”
Quantitative, or complex, traits are aﬀected by multi-
ple interacting genes, each of which have small eﬀects
and are sensitive to the environment. Understanding
the molecular nature of genetic variation for quantita-
tive traits will have an enormous impact on medicine,
livestock and crop breeding, and the study of evolution.
For over half a century North Carolina State University
has been a leading center for research in quantitative
genetics. To enable future scientists to advance our un-
derstanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative
traits, we oﬀer a research and training program that in-tegrates quantitative, population, molecular and devel-
opmental genetics, statistics and molecular evolution.
Our program oﬀers:
* NIH-level stipend with tuition and health insurance *
Travel allowance and research funds * State-of-the-art
research facilities * Internationally recognized faculty
with expertise in theoretical and experimental quanti-
tative genetics * A stimulating academic environment
near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Duke University and the Research Triangle Park * A
beautiful and aﬀordable location with a pleasant cli-
mate between the beaches and the Appalachian moun-
tains
US citizens and permanent residents are eligible for
Fellowships. The Department of Genetics is strongly
committed to promoting diversity in the scientiﬁc com-
munity and encourages applications from individuals of
historically under-represented minority groups.

SyracuseU PlantInsectInteractions
Ph.D. opportunities in the Evolutionary Ecology of
Plant-Insect Interactions Department of Biology at
Syracuse University
I am looking for exceptional students who are interested
in studying the evolutionary ecology of plant-insect in-
teractions. I currently have up to two Ph.D. positions
available for Fall 2007. One position has a one-year
guaranteed research assistantship and both positions
are guaranteed funding via teaching assistantships. The
positions will be part of a project aimed at understand-
ing how coevolution inﬂuences speciation. The work
will focus on the association between yuccas and yucca
moths.
The interaction between yuccas and yucca moths is
a textbook example of coevolution and specialization.
Yucca moths are the sole pollinators of yuccas and
yucca seeds are the exclusive food source for yucca
moth larvae. Among the pollinator moths there is a
high level of host ﬁdelity. Twelve of seventeen pollina-
tor species use only a single yucca species and of the
remaining oligophagous’ moths, two use two host plant
species, two use three, and one uses seven. Clearly, host
plant specialization has featured prominently in the
evolution of this lineage and provides an opportunity
to examine how adaptation to host plants drives speci-
ation in this coevolved lineage. We will be using a com-
mon garden experiment to examine whether host plant
specialization inﬂuences speciation in an oligophagous
yucca moth.
Other projects in the lab center on molecular sys-
tematics, population genetics, and community ecol-
ogy. For more information about these projects,

PhD-POSITION in BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY
Dept. Behavioural Ecology, Institute of Zoology, Uni-
versity of Berne, Switzerland.
This project will focus on the mechanisms underlying
cooperative behaviour between wild- type Norway rats
in a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma situation. We found
that rats cooperate according to direct, indirect and
generalized reciprocity. Our study of proximate mech-
anisms involves the experimental application of candi-
date hormones; the study of ultimate mechanisms in-
volves experimental variation of costs and pay-oﬀs of
donors and receivers of altruistic acts, and appraisal of
the inﬂuence of state and demand on the propensity to
cooperate.
The position is for three years and will start at the ear-
liest possible date, with a salary following the scheme of
the national funding organization of Switzerland. Be-
sides research, PhD students in our institute assist in
undergraduate teaching and supervision.Eligible candi-
dates will have a master&rsquo;s degree (or Diplom) in
Biology and research experience in animal behaviour,
a genuine understanding of evolutionary theory and a
strong commitment to basic science. Practical skills in
handling and experimenting with lab animals, in the
application of hormones, behavioural observations and
in the measurement of physiological parameters will be
very helpful. The study will be supervised by Michael
Taborsky.
The successful candidate will join an active research
group consisting currently of 5 advanced research staﬀ,
8 PhD-students and a varying number of guest scien-
tists and master&rsquo;s students. Besides the Be-
havioural Ecology group, the ecology-focused Zoolog-
ical Institute of the University of Berne consists of re-16 EvolDir December 1, 2006

COMPARATIVE METHODS
University of Hawaii University of Michigan
We seek graduate students to work on our NSF funded
project to develop new tools for comparative analysis,
particularly for the purpose of studying adaptive evo-
lution.
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck methods for Comparative Hy-
potheses (OUCH) is aimed at providing a comprehen-
sive and explicit modeling framework within which bi-
ologists can test hypotheses of adaptive evolution for
continuous characters. The approach is based upon a
model that allows for multiple selective regimes, each
parameterized by an optimal trait value, as well as over-
all strengths of selection and drift. One can arrange se-
lective regimes arbitrarily on a phylogenetic tree. This
ﬂexibility allows hypotheses of arbitrary complexity to
be translated directly into statistical models and con-
fronted with data. We have applied information-based
model-selection techniques to rigorously compare mul-
tiple alternative hypotheses. This allows ﬁne discrimi-
nation among alternatives – alternatives that may diﬀer
only in the regimes speciﬁed on a branch of particular
interest. Because of these features, the method allows
detailed exploration of historical diﬀerences, whether
such hypotheses depend on a speciﬁc ordering of selec-
tive regimes, or a particular ecological or biogeograph-
ical association.
Project Objectives: 1) Application of OUCH to exist-
ing comparative datasets to better illustrate its ana-
lytical power and gain new insight into speciﬁc ques-
tions in evolutionary biology. 2) Deveopment of the-
ory for bivariate, multivariate, and frequency data. 3)
Development of strategies for concurrently accounting
for uncertainty in the phylogeny. 4) Investigation of
statistical properties of the methods. 5) Modules writ-
ten to port these methods into the Mesquite package.
6) Improvements to our project’s web pages. 7) Con-tinued support and distribution of our existing open-
source software (in R) for the methods.
Applications are welcome from individuals with a keen
interest in adaptive evolution, good quantitative back-
ground, and willingness to learn. A basic understanding
of computer programming is a plus.
Project location: University of Hawaii with Marguerite
Butler, and/or University of Michigan with Aaron

Details: I have recently obtained USDA funding in col-laboration with Drs. Allison Snow and Kristin Mer-
cer at Ohio State University for a project on the ef-
fect of early life history stages (seed dormancy, seed
germination, seedling competition) on the persistence
of crop alleles in populations of wild sunﬂowers (He-

interest in risk assessment of transgenic crops. Further,
we have interest in the population ecology of wild sun-
ﬂowers given that it is one of the relatively few native
annual plants of the Great Plains. We will establish
ﬁeld experiments in Kansas that evaluate whether low
seed dormancy and early germination rates of crop-wild
hybrid sunﬂowers are maladaptive (i.e. reduce spread
and persistence of crop alleles in wild populations) or
whether these same traits could increase introgression if
larger hybrid seedlings are more competitive than wild
sunﬂower genotypes.
I am looking for a graduate student who has interest in
this project, as well as developing independent research
in plant population biology. There are a variety of

UManchester CrossSpecies
MicroarrayHybridisations
University of Manchester, UK. Faculty of Life Sciences,
BBSRC Strategic PhD Studentship - Available Now (tostart no later than 28th March 2007)
Project Title : Simulation and Classiﬁcation Study of
Cross Species Microarray Hybridisations Supervisor :
Dr. David Hoyle and Prof. Andy Brass
Description: Microarrays have become a valuable and
commonly used assay available to the molecular biolo-
gist ? being used to monitor the transcript activity of
thousands of genes within an organism, or to quantify
genetic similarities between species. A large amount
of bioinformatics research has been devoted to statis-
tically correcting many of the inherent systematic er-
rors present in microarray data. However for a num-
ber of microarray experiments the actual microarrays
used contain probes constructed using genetic material
from a diﬀerent species to that being studied, e.g. us-
ing mouse cDNA microarrays to study hamster gene
expression, or using microarrays for species compari-
son. Currently little is known about the limitations
and validity of using such cross-species hybridisations,
or the appropriateness of the standard statistical meth-
ods used to handle microarray data.
This bioinformatics project will focus on investigating
the accuracy and limitations of cross species microar-
ray hybridisations, both for gene expression and species
comparison. The student will use a combination of
real and computer simulated cross-species hybridisation
data. This will cover a number of areas in mainstream
microarray bioinformatics as well as modelling DNA
sequence evolution, using computational methods for
phylogeny reconstruction, and accessing bioinformatics
resources for the retrieval of additional sequence, func-
tional and annotation data.

UK/EU applicants who have, or expect to obtain a

Ph.D. opportunities in Plant Systematics Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB), University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor
We are looking for bright, motivated students who wish
to enter the Ph.D. program in Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology at the University of Michigan to conduct
research on the systematics of the large plant genus Eu-
phorbia. The positions will be part of a project entitledEuphorbia a global inventory of the spurges, funded by
the Planetary Biodiversity Inventory program of the
U.S. National Science Foundation. The project began
in October 2006 and will run for ﬁve years, with the
participation of an international team of collaborators
led by Paul E. Berry (University of Michigan, Ann Ar-
bor) and co-PIs Kenneth J. Wurdack (Smithsonian In-
stitution, Washington, DC), David Baum (University
of Wisconsin), and Reed Beaman and Nico Cellinese
(Yale University).
Euphorbia is distributed worldwide and is one of the
largest angiosperm genera, with over 2000 species. The
genus achieves its greatest diversity in arid areas of
Africa and Madagascar, where many species are cactus-
like succulents. Many of the species are rare and en-
dangered, and it is the only genus known to contain

Ph.D. opportunities in Plant Evolutionary Genetics
Graduate Program in Organismal Biology and Ecol-
ogy (OBE) Division of Biological Sciences, University
of Montana
I am seeking exceptional students interested in studying
plant evolutionary genetics as Ph.D. candidates in the
OBE program of the University of Montana. The grad-
uate position(s) is funded by an NSF-FIBR grant fo-
cusing on the genetics of speciation in the diverse wild-
ﬂower genus Mimulus ( http://www.biology.duke.edu/-
mimulus/index.html ). The shared genetic resources de-22 EvolDir December 1, 2006
veloped through the FIBR project (as well as whole
genome sequence now being generated for Mimulus gut-
tatus) provide an exciting opportunity to bridge the
ﬁelds of ecology, evolution and genomics in an emerg-
ing model system. Active areas of research in the
Fishman lab include ﬂoral and mating system evolu-
tion, the genetic mechanisms of hybrid incompatibility,
and the evolution of selﬁsh genetic elements (cytoplas-
mic male sterility and meiotic drive). Students may
participate in ongoing research projects, but will also
be encouraged to initiate and develop independent re-
search. Funding is currently available for up to three
years of RA stipend support (with the balance met with
TAships), as well as research and travel expenses.
The OBE program at the University of Montana is
a vibrant group of students, postdocs and faculty
with particular research strengths in evolutionary bi-
ology/conservation genetics (F. Allendorf, K. Dial, D.
Emlen, L. Fishman, G. Luikart, S. Mills) and plant
population ecology (R. Callaway, E. Crone, J. Maron,
A. Sala). We currently share an NSF-IGERT train-
ing grant in the Ecology of Infectious Diseases with the
Math, Microbiology, and Wildlife Biology programs on
campus. Students in the OBE program are an interac-
tive group with enthusiasm for both science and (this is
Montana, after all!) enjoying the great outdoors. The
University of Montana is located in the student-friendly
town of Missoula, which is nestled in a mountain valley
about half way between Yellowstone and Glacier Na-
tional Parks.
Please contact me directly (lila.ﬁshman@mso.umt.edu)

GRADUATE STUDENTSHIP Marine Molecular Biol-
ogy Laboratory, School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sci-
ences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA
A multidisciplinary approach to estimating larval dis-
persal rates and Distances in brown rockﬁsh (Sebastes
auriculatus).
The Project The extent of dispersal in marine species
has attracted great interest, not only because of its im-
portance for the distribution and evolution of marine
species, but also because it underpins many strategies
in ﬁsh stock assessment and conservation. With the em-
phasis on marine protected areas (MPAs) as a tool for
marine conservation, the question of realized dispersal
has found renewed signiﬁcance, as the eﬃcacy of MPAs
depends critically on the demographic exchange with
surrounding areas. Here, we combine genetic parental
identiﬁcation, artiﬁcial marking of larval otoliths and
oceanographic experiments and modeling to quantify
self recruitment and dispersal distances in brown rock-
ﬁsh (Sebastes auriculatus) in Puget Sound. The project
is funded by Washington Sea Grant.
Job Description The student would join a multidis-
ciplinary team consisting of ﬁeld ecologists (Wash-
ington Department of Fish and Wildlife), oceanog-
raphers (School of Oceanography), molecular geneti-
cists (School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences) and
biochemists (Oregon State University). There would
be opportunity for the student to become involved in
all aspects, but primary responsibilities would include
ﬁeld work (sampling, drifter deployment and recovery)
and molecular genetics. The successful applicant will
show initiative, responsibility and maturity, be able
to work well as part of an interdisciplinary and inter-
institutional team, and be enthusiastic about both ﬁeld
and laboratory work. SCUBA diving is a large part ofthe project, and candidates are expected to have or to
obtain a certiﬁcate. Experience with molecular meth-
ods is beneﬁcial.
The Group Dr Hauser’s laboratory is an active group
shared with Dr Kerry Naish (Marine Molecular Biol-
ogy Laboratory, http://depts.washington.edu/mmbl/ ),
consisting of nine graduate students, one postdoc and
two technicians. Members of the laboratory work on a
wide variety of projects, including population structure
in sockeye salmon, Paciﬁc herring and Paciﬁc cod, re-
productive success in wild and hatchery bred steelhead,
hybridization in Puget Sound rockﬁshes, so providing a
large and dynamic group supporting new students. (For
more information on research projects in Dr Hauser’s
group see http://ﬁsh.washington.edu/people/hauser/-
). The facilities have recently been completely re-
furbished, providing each faculty with about 900 ft2
core lab space, plus common areas for central facilities.
The group is well equipped with a high-throughput
MegaBace 1000 automated sequencer, a Hydra pipet-
ting robot, several PCR machines and other molecular
genetic laboratory equipment.

UppsalaU Hybridization
Uppsala University oﬀers twoPhD positions in Animal
Ecology at the Department of Ecology and Evolution
Two four-year graduate student positions are available
within two diﬀerent projects:
Project 1: “Replacement of species: interaction be-
tween hybridization and interference competition” The
main aim of this project is to investigate the relative
role of introgressive hybridization (i.e. hybridization
leading to gene exchange between species) and inter-
speciﬁc competition in determining population dynam-
ics and local distributions of two closely related species
of ﬂycatchers. Breeding data and blood samples have
already been collected for many years and can be com-
bined with data on climate and habitat structure. This
project is suitable for a person who ﬁnds the combina-
tion of conservation biology and evolutionary processes
attractive. The student will be responsible for further
data collection and planning relevant experiments.
Impact: As a result of direct human impact, species
that have been separated for millions of years are now
being brought together at an increasing speed. Still, the
relative role of hybridization in driving patterns of local
extinction remains largely unknown. This is probablybecause patterns of hybridization, and especially pat-
terns of backcrossing are diﬃcult to detect and evaluate
in natural populations. This project has the potential
to increase our general knowledge regarding the conse-
quences of hybridization.
Projects 2: “Speciation and evolution in hybrid zones”
The main aim of this project is to solve central ques-
tions regarding speciation: Is species recognition a by-
product of evolution of mate choice among conspeciﬁcs?
Are genetically determined traits (e.g. plumage) or
partly learned traits (e,g, song) used to signal species
identity? How many genetic substitutions are involved
in the evolution of genetic incompatability? In what
genomic regions do these mutations occur? These type
of questions will be approached experimentally. This
project is suitable for a person who is interested in an-
imal behaviour and molecular genetics.
Impact: Speciation lies at the heart of evolutionary bi-
ology and is the driving force behind biodiversity. Nev-
ertheless, many central questions regarding speciation
remain unresolved. Recent development of novel molec-
ular and statistic tools has only now made it possible
to answer many of these questions. This project has
the potential to yield novel insights into the process of
speciation.
Both projects include ﬁeldwork that is carried out on
the Swedish island of ¨Oland in the Baltic during May
and June. The rest of the training program, including
data analysis and lab work is carried out at the depart-
ment in Uppsala. The close links between departments
within the Evolutionary Biology Centre oﬀers excellent
possibilities for interdisciplinary research in evolution-
ary biology.
A M. Sc. Degree in biology is required and the salary
will follow the guidelines from Uppsala University (ris-
ing from approx. 15 000 to 22 000 SEK/month in 4
years). Send the application, including a CV and a
letter of motivation and arrange to have a letter of ref-
erence sent to me at the address below no later than 30
November 2006. Shortlisted candidates can expect to
be called for an interview.

Wageningen MallardPopGenet
Host-parasite interaction in the mallard (Anas
platyrynchos) with respect to inﬂuenza dispersal and
host migration, assessed by population genetic means.
Job description: The aim of this project is to ﬁnd out
how avian inﬂuenza and its host, the mallard, inﬂu-
ence each other with respect to dispersal and what the
role herein is of individual genetic quality. The mallard
is considered the primary natural reservoir of avian in-
ﬂuenza due to its wide range and large population sizes.
Avian inﬂuenza can be a threat not only to the mallard
but also to poultry farming and even human health.
Various breeding, sedentary and wintering populations
throughout Europe and Asia will be sampled. The pop-
ulation genetic structure of the mallard will be anal-
ysed with a set of 80 microsatellites and MHC class
1 sequences. The population genetic structure of avian
inﬂuenza will be analyzed with RNA sequences. For as-
sociations with individual ﬁtness parasite load will be
estimated and various morphometric measurements will
be performed, such as body weight, quality of feathers
and amount of body fat.
Requirements:
You have a university Master’s degree with specializa-
tion in animal ecology, genetics or population genetics.
Conditions of employment:
It concerns a vacancy for four years; appointment will
initially take place for a period of one year to evaluate
suitability; if suitability is determined to be adequate,
the employment contract will be extended for the re-
maining duration of the PhD programme.

Job description: The aim of this project is to analyze
the eﬀects of the population structure of the European
Wild Boar on the prevalence and transmission of para-
sites, as well as the selective eﬀects on immune related
genes. The Wild Boar is increasing its range, reach-
ing levels previously unrecorded. This has already con-
tributed to spread of many contagious diseases. This
can negatively aﬀect the ﬁtness and trophy quality of
game species, public health, livestock health, and the
conservation of endangered species.
Wild Boar populations throughout Europe will be sam-
pled that diﬀer with respect to population size and den-
sity, connectivity and migration with other populations,
and parasite prevalence. One will try to relate various
classes of immune related genes to individual ﬁtness, es-
timated by morphometric and reproductive character-
istics and the presence of parasites. Parasite exposure
will be estimated amongst others by antibody preva-
lence. Additionally, comparisons will be made with
neutral genetic markers.

trapping animals, attaching and implanting radio trans-mitters, radio tracking, setting up automatic video
recording equipment around burrows, monitoring in-
dividual activity with PIT-tags and readers, and con-
ducting extensive behavioral observations. There will
also be opportunities to conduct controlled behavioral
experiments in the ﬁeld as well as in a small “lab” en-
closure we plan to build for additional experiments. Fi-

quencing, and gel electrophoresis. The SRA will per-
form the above under general supervision of the princi-
pal investigator and supervise the maintenance of lab-
oratory equipment. They will be responsible for or-
dering necessary reagents and supplies for the lab, and
train/supervise undergraduate students and lab assis-
tants to perform some lab procedures.

AFLP data sets
Dear population geneticists,I’m working on a method for population genetic anal-
ysis of AFLP data (or any multilocus dominant geno-
typic data), and I’d like to try it out on some real data.
Please email me at paulj@stats.gla.ac.uk if you would
be willing to let me look at your data set (I promise not
to do anything underhand with it).50 EvolDir December 1, 2006
The idea of the method is to get around the usual prob-
lem of having to assume HWE (or some ﬁxed level of
deviation from HWE) in order to estimate allele fre-
quencies, or some statistic that depends on allele fre-
quencies. Speciﬁcally, I would be trying to ﬁnd infor-
mation on Fis in your data.
Ideally, the genotypes should:
- come from a species where heteromorphic (e.g.
XX/XY or XX/XO) sex chromosomes form at least 5%
of the genome; - have at least 200 polymorphic loci; -
have at least 100 individuals of each sex (sex must be
known); - have minimal genetic structure (low Fst).
These aren’t hard-and-fast rules. E.g. small sex chro-
mosomes would be oﬀset by a large number of loci.
The population doesn’t have to be in HWE (Fis can be
large).
Please email me at paulj@stats.gla.ac.uk if you think
you can help.
Thank you, Paul

AFLP or Microsat
Dear people,
We are working on a plant species with very weak ge-
netic diﬀerentiation among the subpopulations (over-
all Fst was 0.018), revealed by 11 microsatellite (each
produced 9.2 alleles on average), which makes the in-
dividual assignment (to determine the possible inter-
population migration) impossible. We are wondering
whether AFLP could produce better resolution on pop-
ulation genetic diﬀerentiation, because AFLP is sup-
posed to sample a larger area of genome than mi-
crosatellite does. The species is long-lived (up to 300
years), birds and small animals pollinated.
We appreciate your suggestions.

AFLP scoring
Dear Evoldir members,
I am just starting to use AFLP’s (having used microsats
before), and am looking for any tips/suggestions when
initially scoring chromatograms or deciding alleles from
these for binning i.e.
Do you have a minimum signal level for scoring an allele
that you do not drop below?
Do you look for a particular pattern leading upto a
maximum peak?
Do you ignore the ﬁrst 50 bp of the signal to let the
machine ’settle’?
Etc, etc.
Many thanks in advance for any advice given,

AFLP scoring answers
Hi Evoldirs,
thank you very much for your answers, it appears a sim-
ilar question was asked not so long ago. I have pasted
the replies below.
Hi, Are you using the automatic scoring from Geno-
typer? My advice is don’t, you can not really trust the
machine to score your peaks only based on the peak
size. Are you deﬁning categories? If you deﬁne a cat-
egory by drawing the square on a peak and then ctl+l
(give it a name and select highest peak, exclusive, with
(scaled) height of at least ) for each band individually
you are more likely to extract the real data. It is like
giving standards for each band-size individually. You’ll
probably ﬁnd that each band-size has its own charac-
teristics and then you’ll be able to tell between noise
and a real peak. You may have to avoid overlapping
categories, since they are very noisy. You’ll ﬁnd that
some peaks need the (scaled) height of 1000 and oth-December 1, 2006 EvolDir 51
ers of 90. It is kind of half-ways between hand-scoring
and the automatic method. Yes, it is time-consuming,
a good two weeks of scoring only, but is worthy. I have
also found that Nei’s distances are not appropriate for
AFLPs, they assume the same mutation rate across
loci. For a dendorgram try Reynolds, Weir and Cock-
erham’s 1983 as implemented in Phylip.That one does
not assume equal mutation rate. Hope this helps,

Hi,
I have spent a lot of time also thinking about the prob-
lem with calling AFLPs. I have been working with
Steve Keller at UVA, and I think an email he sent me
recently might be helpful.
Second, I’ve ﬁddled with this quite a bit, and thought
about it even more (sometimes to the point of keeping
me up at night!). As you say, it’s subjective. I don’t see
any way around that. However, my best solution has
been the following: First, make sure you assign each
individual sample a relative signal strength (Genotyper
has a way of doing this automatically), so you normal-
ize signal strength among your samples. Next, deﬁne
your loci across the entire sample using a very stringent
(i.e., high RFU threshold, say 200) criteria. The intent
here is that only “real” loci are going to get deﬁned.
This approach requires a high signal strength in only
one individual for a locus to get deﬁned. After I get my
loci deﬁnitions this way, I then score all the samples
with a less stringent RFU requirement (say 50). That
way, you’re scoring individuals for loci that you have
high conﬁdence are real and not artifactual, but you
are lenient on whether any given individual is present
for that locus.
I have started to use this technique and feel more con-
ﬁdent when I’m seeing a peak vs. noise. I think that
20 is too low.
Hope this helps. Amy
Hi, I don’t know what instrument you are using to
run your AFLP samples, but the ABI capillary sys-
tem we’ve been using (ABI 3100) only processes peaks
above 50. It’s suggested you do not score low peaks as
it’s close to instrument threshold. So if I’m correct peo-
ple usualy score peaks that are mostly above 100. The
problem with smaller peaks is not only the risk that an-
other small peak won’t be detected, but also some small
peaks can be just AFLP artefacts – >hence 2 possibil-
ities of introduction of noise into your dataset. Using
AFLP, you should have a plenty of markers, so using
less, but more correct ones should only be an advan-tage. Another thing to look at is the size of your bins
(categories) in Genotyper. I think the recommended
size is around 1bp. So adopting rather broader con-
cepts of categories - as size of peaks may vary slightly
between runs or capillaries - may also reduce some noise
in your data. Especially if you have a lot of markers
that are quite close to each other and/or many diverse
populations or even species. Hope this helps & good
luck with your work! Sarka

Hi,
I have been wrestling with my AFLP’s for a couple of
years now, so I can tell you what I’ve learned. I’d be
interested to hear what others advise you as well.
Abundant noise is common for AFLP’s, as well as prob-
lems with changes in signal strength between runs, and
diﬀerences in peak size due to heterozygosity and su-
perimposition of diﬀerent fragments of the same length.
Because of these things, it is appropriate to limit your
’loci’ to those that you can score reliably, even in weak
samples. I focus on peaks that appear several times the
strength of the background noise in at least some sam-
ples, then go through and look carefully for peaks of any
size in those positions in the other samples. I do not feel
that diﬀerentiation of heterozygotes and homozygotes
is possible or reliable or distinguishable from superim-
posed fragments of diﬀerent origin, so I score any size
peak at a locus equally. It is important to run samples

to obtain enough DNA for 10 to 20 PCR.

Dear all,
We are having big problems getting stable DNA out of
a barnacle, Balanus amphitrite.
Other organisms, including a local barnacle, work ﬁne
with a simple SDS/Tris buﬀer, NaAc prec, and then
ethanol precipitation.
This one doesn’t give any DNA that way. Neither do
any of the column based extractions we have tried. The
best so far is a CTAB based method that we normally
use for plants. It is has two chloroform extraction steps.
But even that DNA (a lot of it, dissolved in TE) de-
grades fairly quickly after extraction.
Does anyone have an idea why the column based ex-
tractions and puriﬁcations give us no DNA at all.
Any other suggestions? We are rather desperate.
I am happy to post the suggestions on evoldir or email
to individuals.

Creation Evolution Survey
NullHypothesis
Hi,
This is just a thought, but it seems like the appropriate
null hypothesis to compare evolution and creationism to
is that the Earth and all species have always existed as
they currently exist. Then, to support either evolution
or creationism, one would have to look at the evidenceto support either one in comparison to that null hypoth-
esis. I don’t have a background in philosophy of science,
but this seems like a more appropriate framework than
the current “creation science/intelligent design” view
that creationism is the null hypothesis and any “lack of
evidence” for evolution is support for intelligent design.
I welcome any feedback on this thought.

ESF ThermalAdaptation workshop
We are launching a new ESF Programme on
Thermal adaptation in ectotherms: Linking
life history, physiology, behaviour and genetics
(ThermAdapt). Information, particularly a sum-
mary of the scope of the programme, is now
available at http://www.esf.org/esf article.php?
language=0&activity=1&domain=3&articlea0&page04.
The Objective of this ESF Programme is to foster a
multidisciplinary European network of scientists work-
ing on thermal adaptation. We particularly aim to inte-
grate research at multiple levels of investigation, includ-
ing genetics, physiology, ecology, behaviour or theory.
Interested persons or groups are encouraged to join our
activities. These include advertising their expertise via
our web site, and participation in various activities to
be announced separately and regularly over the next
5 years such as workshops, training courses, short and
long exchange grants, exchange of specimens and ex-
pertise, sharing of facilities, and scientiﬁc collaboration
of any kind.
We here Call for Applications for local organization of
Workshops on speciﬁc topics within the realm of the
ThermAdapt Programme
Such workshops, ﬁnanced by our ESF programme
if approved, bring together between 10 and 50 par-
ticipants for 2 to 4 days to focus on a speciﬁc is-
sue and are planned to occur on an annual ba-
sis over the next 5 years. We start by refrain-ing from narrowing down the topic of possible work-
shops, although in the long term some structure will
be desirable. See http://www.esf.org/generic/1817/-
Annex4GuidelinesforScienceMeetings.pdf for applica-
tion guidelines and forms. The deadline is 15 February
2007.
Workshop grant applications will be chosen based on
scientiﬁc quality, and priority will be given to appli-
cants who come from or intend to visit countries sup-
porting the programme (Austria, Belgium, Czech Re-
public, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary,
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland),
but other European nations can be involved.

Hymenopterist Society
Hi,
as the Archivist & Webmaster of the Interna-
tional Society of Hymenopterists, I wanted to
let you know that I designed a completely new
website for the Society. Please have a look
at it: <http://www.hymenopterists.org/ >http://-
www.hymenopterists.org We have exciting plans for
the Society, for example adding an electronic version to
our journal, the Journal of Hymenoptera Research. To
implement our ideas, we need as much support as we
can get. If you are interested in ants, bees, sawﬂies, or
other wasps or if you simply believe that the entomolog-
ical world should have a journal dedicated to research
on Hymenoptera, please join the Society. Annual dues
are low and include the journal.
You would be joining a lively community of more
than 250 hymenopterists from around the globe.
You can meet some of us on the website ( <http:/-
/www.hymenopterists.org/members.html )>http:/-
/www.hymenopterists.org/members.html ) and in
person at the Hymenoptera Symposium at the ESA
conference in Indiana in about a month.
I hope we will be able to welcome you soon,

Inexpensive DNA sequencing
Hi All, I am preparing to sequence a few thousand PCR
products. I am looking for a company/university that
will do this sequencing quickly, accurately, and, most
importantly, cheaply. I would be grateful to hear any
suggestions on companies (national or international)
that people have used in the past for this kind of mod-
erate throughput sequencing.

Info on GrantWriting Workshops
Our department is interested in the availability of
Grant Writing workshops, seminars, etc. that are
speciﬁcally designed for people submitting propos-
als to agencies that fund evolutionary and ecolog-
ical research like the National Science Foundation.
We are aware of programs like “The Grant In-
stitute” <http:// www.thegrantinstitute.com/ >and
“Grant Writers’ Seminars & Workshops LLC” <http:/-
/www.grantcentral.com/ >,but are not sure if these
programs (or others like them) are useful in our ﬁelds
and for our target funding agencies. If anyone has had
any experience with such workshops we would appreci-ate any feedback on their utility. Suggestions for alter-
native workshops would also be welcome.

Morality and Evolution
“A common theme in anti-evolution writings is that
teaching kids about Darwin will cause them to lose
all touch with morality, and will end up committing
crimes. It might follow that evolutionary biologists
themeselves would be especially overrepresented in the
criminal justice system. Therefore, I’d like to make
a bar graph that shows the number of individuals
with PhDs in evolutionary biology who are currently
in prison. A possible control group to eliminate edu-
cational level might be ”PhDs in theology“ in prison
(e.g., Kent Hovind).Anyone have any ideas on how to get the data?
Thanks for any leads.”

NonWestern History of Evolution
Dear Evoldir, I am about to teach an introductory
course in evolution. In preparing a lecture on the his-
tory of evolution, I have become accutely aware of the
lack of discussion about other cultures’ perception of
evolution. Obviously, domestication of animals and
plants suggests at least a rudimentary understanding of
the process. But, in the texts I have found, even Pre-
Darwinian history discusses only a Western perspective
of speciation.
Does anyone know of literature discussing a non-
Western understanding of evolution? Please reply to
campbell.633@osu.edu THANK YOU for any ideas you
might have! Lesley.

email: gravesjl@ncat.edu; phone: (336)-285-2060; mo-
bile: (336)-707-1556 I don’t think you are going to ﬁnd
evidence of pre-20th century, evolutionary thinking as
a whole outside of Western Europe. You may be able to
focus your discussion on particular aspects of the Dar-
winian syllogism (such as variation, heredity, and strug-
gle for existence) or the species concept. For example,
Ernest Mayer in The Growth of Biological Thought ,
Harvard University Press 1982 discusses how his iden-
tiﬁcation of bird species in Papua New Guinea diﬀered
from the native people by only one species. His expla-
nation for his was that they were unaware of the inter-
breeding of two of their species, which diﬀered slightly
by habitat and morphology. You might be able to ﬁnd
information on how non-Western cultures viewed the
idea of the species. I often use the Biblical references
in Genesis, chapter 1:11 states: “seed bearing plants
and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it,
according to their varying kinds.” Indigenous West-
ern African notions of kinds are based in animism and
speak more to spiritual entities as opposed to material
beings (e.g. Mbiti, J., African Religions and Philosophy
2nd Ed., Heineman, 1969 & Hountondji, P.J., African
Philosophy: Myth & Reality, Indiana University Press,
1983.) You might also ﬁnd some interesting material by
examining how diﬀerent cultures developed their ideas
on human variation. I discuss some of this in Graves,
J.L., The Race Myth: Why We Pretend Race Exists
in America, Dutton 2005. Also in a piece I wrote for
Tapestry Press, I discuss Chinese folk notions of hu-
man ancestry, Graves, J.L., The meaning of race in
the African American Experience, in Africana Legacy:
Diasporic Studies in the Americas, 2006. I also just
thought of some other books that can give you some
direction in your quest.
-Lindberg, C., The Beginnings of Western Science: The
European Scientiﬁc Tradition in Philosophical, Reli-
gious, and Institutional Context, 600 BC to 1450, Uni-
versity of Chicago Press, 1992 – has chapters on the
origins of science, ancient Egyptians, and Islamic sci-
ence.
-Moore, J., Science as a Way of Knowing: The Foun-
dations of Modern Biology, Harvard University Press,
1993 – chapters on the antecedents of scientiﬁc thought,
also Mesopotamia and Babylon.
-Bucaille, M., The Bible, the Qur’an and Science: The
Holy Scriptures Examined in the Light of Modern Sci-
ence, 1981 – originally published in Arabic, good com-
parison of Christian, Jewish, and Islamic views of his-tory and science, contrasted to modern scientiﬁc views
of same.
Also, looking at your email address I am assuming your
are at Ohio State. If my assumption is correct, you will
need to give some thought to how you teach evolution-
ary ideas to African American students. By necessity
this has been an interest of mine (as the ﬁrst African
American evolutionary biologist in US history.) One of
the challenges you will confront is Afrocentrism. I have
written some on this see:

variation: Biological determinism and the mythology of
race. Race Relations Abstracts 18(3):4-34. Sage Pub-
lishers.
William J. Etges wetges@uark.edu I think there is some
good information in Coyne and Orr’s (2004) Speciation
on how non-scientists view species. There are references
about this as well.

non-Western traditions. I believe I’m conversant with

Omnibeniﬁcent reference
While looking up the earliest recorded use of the word
omnibeniﬁcent I discovered (in the Encyclopedia Bri-December 1, 2006 EvolDir 61
tannica?) the following quote:
An early use of omnibenevolent is by William Penn,
the leader of the Quakers who founded Pennsylvania.
In 1679 he said What an omniscient and omnipotent
God did know and could do for mans salvation, an om-
nibenevolent God would certainly have done.
Can anyone inform of the reference for this? Thanks a

Paternity Parentage programs
Dear all,
does anybody know how to work with the software
FaMoz (Gerber et al. 2003) or GeneticStudio (Rod-
ney Dyer)? I am running into a lot of trouble using
them. Both accept my input ﬁles, but:
- The Twogener analysis in FaMoz gives only results for
the normal distributions. All other distribution types
crash my Computer.
- GenetiCstudio gives only the allele frequencies for my
ﬁrst to samples, the genetic diversity function closes the
program
- The TwoGener function in GeneticStudio either works
for the ﬁrst two samples only, causes a run time error
or closes the program
I am thankful for suggestions, help and ideas.

Phyloinformatics journal demise
The Open Access web-only journal “Phyloinformatics”
seems to have disappeared, with the Internet address
http://www.phyloinformatics.org now up for sale. This
means the articles have just disappeared!
There weren’t many papers published, but some were
interesting and have been cited in the mainstream lit-
erature.
This also illustrates the problems with linking to digitalresources using URLs, as opposed to identiﬁers such as
DOIs. With the loss of the domain name, this journal
has eﬀectively died.
A sobering lesson...

Rod
As a number of people have noted, most of the papers
published in this journal can be recovered from the In-
ternet Archive. Paul Sereno kindly sent me a PDF of
his paper, so I’ve put all eight published papers online
at the Systematic Biology web site. You can ﬁnd them
here: http://systbio.org/?q=node/150 . There is also a

Plant Material Transport
Dear all,
I’m planning a new trip to collect some extra material
for my ongoing molecular study on cacti. Last time
these ﬂeshy samples (that can become thicker than 2
cm) were collected on the ﬁeld and stored in a paper
back without freezing. After a few days they were put
in a metal suitcase and transported as cargo (a trip of
1.5 day). Hereafter they were put directly into a freezer
at -20C. Most of the samples remained intact but trans-
port costs were high because large samples (up to 20 X
15 cm) were collected to be sure green (not rotten) ma-
terial reached our University.
Just to optimize this next ﬁeld trip I was wondering
whether there a better and/or cheaper way to transport
these samples bearing in mind that I use microsatellites
and they are extremely ﬂeshy.

Purchasing PCR machines
Dear All,
I’m after a little advice on purchasing new equipment.
We wish to buy a couple of new PCR machines as
lab workhorses for phylogeographical work, microsats,
AFLPs etc. I’d appreciate any advice going on good
machines to get considering the usual criteria of tight
budget, reliability, durability and ease of use.

Sargassum muticum samples
Sargassum muticum samples
Dear colleagues: I have recently started my PhD re-
search project at the University of Glamorgan in Wales,
looking at the molecular ecology of the invasive alga
Sargassum muticum, under the supervision of Drs.
Georgina Harper and Tim Johnson. As part of my
study I am looking to complete a global phylogeograph-
ical study of this species with a view to uncovering in-
vasion routes, source populations and genetic diversity
on invaded regions. I am therefore trying to get mate-
rial from a wide range of worldwide locations includingits native range in the northwest Paciﬁc (Japan, China
and Korea). I would greatly appreciate if you have any
samples - herbarium dried or preserved in EtOH - suit-
able for DNA analyses that you may be able to share
with me: or if you may be able to collect some sam-
ple material and send it to me. Your help will allow
analysing most of the worldwide population diversity,
which would be a fantastic element for my PhD research
work. If you do have samples to share or could collect
some material and send it on, we could sort out a pro-
tocol for sending them to Glamorgan University and
we would provide the cost of postage so that no cost is
involved on your side. Thanks a lot for your help and
please feel free to contact me with any questions you
may have.

Application Deadline: 1 February 2007
The Research Training Program is a museum-based,
in-residence program exclusively for currently enrolled,
English proﬁcient, college-level undergraduate students
interested in a career in the biological, geological or an-
thropological sciences. Through a competitive review
process approximately 20 outstanding students from
around the world are selected each year to participate.
Students partner with a Smithsonian scientist to inves-
tigate a natural history research topic as well as partic-
ipate in a series of lectures, workshops, demonstrations,
behind-the-scenes tours, and ﬁeld trips that focused on
exploring natural history science and developing the
skills necessary to become eﬀective researchers. Stu-
dents, in collaboration with their Smithsonian research
advisor, develop and test a scientiﬁc hypothesis and
communicate the results through written manuscripts
plus oral and poster presentations. Research is con-
ducted in-residence at the Smithsonian’s National Mu-
seum of Natural History in Washington, DC utilizingDecember 1, 2006 EvolDir 63
the vast research facilities and collection of the Museum
including 127 million natural history specimens.
Comments RTP ’06 participant Sheena Ketchum: “The
RTP lectures and tours provided me with a com-
pletely rounded and hands-on natural history educa-
tion that is impossible to obtain anywhere else. Only
here, and only through the RTP, over a course of
ten weeks, could I have held a stone hand axe from
Olduvai Gorge, touched a Mars meteorite, examined
a 8,000 year-old skeleton from North America, played
with a Clovis Point, worn a giant sapphire ring, held
an atlatl, seen a coelacanth, picked up a piece of the
world’s mantle, seen specimens collected by historical
ﬁgures such as: Theodore Roosevelt and Charles Dar-
win, had3
4of a pound of gold thrown at me, ran my
ﬁnger along the KT Boundary, smelled fossilized dung,
seen the ”Soap Man“ and other mummies, examined
Hopewellian beads made out of a meteorite, touched
pieces of the Burgess Shale, seen countless type speci-
mens, viewed the shrunken heads of the Jivaro, held a
4.56 billion-year-old meteorite, visited the rare books
collection, seen a giant squid, experienced ”museum
time“ ﬁrst hand, as well as countless other experiences.”
Participants are provided stipend ($3,000), plus hous-
ing and travel. Detailed information and applica-
tion materials are available electronically at: http:/-

BEAST v1.4 2002-2006 Bayesian Evolutionary Analy-
sis Sampling Trees by Alexei J. Drummond and Andrew

burgh a.rambaut@ed.ac.uk
BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian
MCMC analysis of molecular sequences. It is entirely
orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies
inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models.
It is not intended solely as a method of reconstructing
phylogenies but also as a framework for testing evo-
lutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single
tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree
space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its
posterior probability. We include a simple to use user-
interface program for setting up standard analyses and
a suit of programs for analysing the results.
BEAST v1.4 is available for download from here:
<http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/ >Our on-going ef-
forts to provide useful documentation for BEAST is
here:
<http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/help/ >BEAST is
an extremely complex program and as such will in-
evitably have bugs. Please email us to discuss any
problems:

We would encourage you to join the BEAST users’
mailing-list to get notiﬁcations of updates and bugs. At64 EvolDir December 1, 2006
a later date this may be expanded to be a discussion-
list so that users can exchange ideas and help. You can
join the mailing list here:
<http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/-
beast user/>Main New Features: Faster likelihood
calculations after rejecting a state. Whilst the im-
provement in speed will vary, the indications are that
this is a signiﬁcant overall speed improvement.
Rates for relaxed clock models can be written embed-
ded in the tree for later analysis.
BEAUti can now create TaxonSets and apply prior
probability distributions to the tMRCA of these.
In version 1.2 of BEAUti we introduced the ability to
save and load BEAUti documents in order to store all
the settings and make changes later. Now in version 1.4
we have altered the how this works so that it is possible
to save “Template Files” which contain all the selected
settings but not the actual data. These templates can
be used to create a library of standard models which
can then be applied (by opening them) to other data
sets. Additionally these templates can be used in a
non-interactive way using the command-line to convert
NEXUS ﬁles to BEAST ﬁles. This can be used as part
of a script.
Additionally, two new programs are distributed as part
of the BEAST package: LogCombiner & TreeAnnota-
tor. LogCombiner can combine log or tree ﬁles from
multiple runs of BEAST into a single combined results
ﬁle (after removing appropriate burn-ins). TreeAnno-
tator can summarize a sample of trees from BEAST
using a single target tree, annotating it with posterior
probabilities, HPD node heights and rates. This tree
can then be viewed in a new program called ’FigTree’
which is available from:

nally, we are pleased to announce that BEAST is now

FigTree v1.0 2006 Andrew Rambaut
FigTree is designed as a graphical viewer of phyloge-
netic trees and as a program for producing publication-
ready ﬁgures. As with most of my programs, it was
written for my own needs so may not be as polished
and feature-complete as a commericial program.
This program is available from:
<http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software/ﬁgtree >I have
set up a Wiki page here which will used to post docu-
mentation:
<http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/beast/help/FigTree >
Mac OS X, Linux/UNIX and Windows versions are
available
FigTree requires a Java Virtual Machine to run. Many
systems will already have this installed. It requires at
least version 1.5 of Java to run (see README ﬁle for
details).
Mac OS X version 10.4 or better (Tiger) will already
have a suitable version of Java installed. I am sorry but
FigTree simply doesn’t run on older versions of Mac OS
X.
Features
Cross-platform graphical tree display. Three diﬀerent
tree styles: rectangular, polar and radial. Display of
node heights, branch lengths, support values and other
annotations. Node height range bars if available. Col-
lapse of clades into triangles. Colouring of branches
and tip labels. Colouring by annotation (for example,
support values). Quick search for tip labels or partial
tip labels. Printing and export as PDF graphics.
At present there is no manual for using FigTree. I sug-
gest you simply try playing with the various controls
and buttons.
Please note that I have moved to the University of Ed-
inburgh. All though my programs will continue to be
hosted on the Oxford website, at some point they will
move north too.

Software GESTE GeneticStructure
Dear evoldir members,
We wish to introduce GESTE (GEnetic STructure in-
ference based on genetic and Environmental data), a
Bayesian method to evaluate the eﬀect that biotic and
abiotic environmental factors (geographic distance, lan-
guage, temperature, altitude, local population sizes,
etc.) have on the genetic structure of populations. It
can also be used to study spatial population processes,
such as range expansions, by introducing longitude and
latitude as the explanatory variables.
GESTE estimates F ST values for each local popula-
tion and relates them to environmental factors using
a generalized linear model. The method requires ge-
netic data from codominant markers (e.g. allozymes,
microsatellites, or SNPs) and environmental data spe-
ciﬁc to each local population. The software is written
in C++ and integrates a tool to draw posterior den-
sity functions (histogram, running mean, traces, etc.)
and to estimate parameters from them (mean, mode,
variance, HPDI etc.)
You can down load it from
http://www-leca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm The pro-
gram should be cited as follows:
Foll, M and O Gaggiotti. 2006. Identifying the envi-
ronmental factors that determine the genetic structure
of populations. Genetics, 174: 875891.
Questions concerning the use of the software should
be addressed to Matthieu Foll (Matthieu.Foll@ujf-

IMPBioFr.htmSoftware IBDWS 3
Colleagues,
Isolation By Distance, Web Service (IBDWS) has now
been updated to version 3.0.
IBDWS is a specialized package for isolation by distance
analyses of codominant markers (e.g., microsatellites,
allozymes) or DNA sequence data. Users may also en-
ter genetic distance matrices calculated from any other
program.
Recent changes include: 1. IBDWS is now hosted at
http://ibdws.sdsu.edu/ This server should have less
down time than the previous host. 2. DNA sequence
data may be uploaded in FASTA format. Several mod-
els of evolution are available. A complete set of options
for dealing with gaps and missing data are presented.
3. The Mantel test results are presented with improved
clarity and precision. 4. As of version 2.6, you may
bookmark the results page for large analyses that take
a signiﬁcant amount of time to run, and return to check
on them later.
We are currently working on speed optimizations and
hope to implement those soon.

Software JMATING
Dear evoldir members:
We wish to announce that the software JMATING has
been UPDATED to the version 1.0.8 (November 2006).66 EvolDir December 1, 2006
This software is able to do a battery of analyses to study
sexual isolation and sexual selection eﬀects from mat-
ing frequency data. The program has a friendly user
windows interface and it is implemented in Java (works
in both PC and MAC).
The NEW feature provided in this version is the pos-
sibility to estimate a sexual isolation ASYMMETRY
index and calculate a probability of rejecting the null
hypothesis (no asymmetry) being true, by bootstrap-
ping

tion called Truth in Science, which peddles creationist
stuﬀ to UK schools. He replied that:
“I would be very happy to act on this matter as soon
as you can prove beyond all reasonable doubt that Cre-
ationism is not true, and I look forward to hearing from
you as soon as possible.”

mtDNA sample size
Dear all,
I have a dataset of mtDNA sequences from circa 30 dif-
ferent populations, with generally 10 to 12 sequences
per population. However, from four selected popula-
tions I have 24 to 48 sequences. How (and with which
software package) can I correct for sample size, e.g. for
calculating gene/haplotpye diversity, N of polymorphic
sites per population, mean N of pairwise diﬀerences,
nucleotide diversity, etc... ?

mtDNA sample size answers
Dear all,
Apparently, several collaegues cope with the question
how one can correct for sample sizes, when analysing
mtDNA sequence data.
At best, one uses a diversity index which is insensitive
to sample size oﬀ course, but nevertheless, it would be
nice to be able to deﬁne a measure for haplotype di-
versity, No of polymorphic sites, etc. when you have a
dataset with unequal sample sizes among the popula-
tions/groups.
Below, I post the answers I received thus far. If you
are developing a package that can handle this problem,
please keep us informed.Thanks to everybody, Dieter Anseeuw.
Dieter, The HP-Rare software might be useful for per-
forming rarefaction on haplotypes diversity. The pro-
gram uses the Genepop format for input ﬁles, but you
could code the genotypes as having a missing allele.
Steven Kalinowksi
Hello Dieter. I am working on such a program, but it
will not be ready until the new year. I am unaware of
any programs that can do these calculations. If you re-
ceive some responses referring to existing programs I’d
like to know, as I will be able to save myself a lot of
time.
Joseph W. Brown
Hey Dieter, a common procedure we use to correct for
non sampling errors is solving the Cornuet and Aries al-
gorithm: - Cornuet JM, Aries F (1980) Number of sex
alleles in a sample of honeybee colonies. Apidologie,
11: 87-93.

Cologne PlantGeneRegulation
Postdoc: Evolution of plant gene regulation in Cologne,
Germany
A Postdoc position is available at the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany,
to join Juliette de Meaux’lab, in the department of Ge-
netics and Plant Breeding.
Our research group is interested in evaluating the role
played by cis-regulatory DNA in adaptive evolution.
For this, we are studying the evolutionary dynamics of
functional non-coding regions within and among closely
related species of the Arabidopsis genus. Our ulti-
mate goal is to relate this diversity to its ecological
role in natural environments. Cis-regulatory evolu-
tion remains largely unexplored and there is plenty of
room for investigating novel evolutionary concepts and
ideas. The successful applicant will be encouraged to
develop her/his own research project within this frame-
work. Evolutionary geneticists interested in evolution-
ary transcriptomics and/or population genetics of non-
coding DNA are especially encouraged to apply.
The Max Planck Institute oﬀers an outstanding en-
vironment for carrying out ambitious and innovative
research. Our research group exists since September
2005. It belongs to the Department of Genetics and
Plant Breeding, which brings together plant molecu-
lar biologists, quantitative geneticists and evolutionary
biologists to investigate the causes and consequences
of plant natural variation. The Institute beneﬁts from
a superb interdisciplinary scientiﬁc community, with
world class molecular biology being performed and ac-
tive contacts with outstanding evolutionary geneticists
located in the nearby University of Cologne.
Cologne, the metropolis on the Rhine, has just over
one million inhabitants and is the fourth-largest city in
Germany. It oﬀers plenty of cultural and recreational
activities. The city further beneﬁts from its central
location in the European travel network. Trains go di-
rectly from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt Interna-
tional Airport. Low cost air companies operate at the
local airport (K¨ oln-Bonn) and can take you anywhere
in Europe in a couple of hours.Applicants are encouraged to consult the Insti-
tute/Departmental websites at http://www.mpiz-
koeln.mpg.de/english/research/koornneefGroup/-
demeaux/index.h tml . Review of applications will
begin immediately and continue until the position
is ﬁlled. Please provide a cover letter (detailing
your research achievements, goals and motivation for
joining our group) as well as a curriculum vitae and
contact information for three referees and submit to:
Juliette de Meaux <demeaux@mpiz-koeln.mpg.de >
. Don’t hesitate to contact J. de Meaux if you
have speciﬁc questions about this announcement.
The position is funded by a fellowship of the Max
Planck Society for up to three years. Starting date is
ﬂexible. For our most recent publication, check doi:

ESF ThermalAdaptation
We are launching a new ESF Programme on
Thermal adaptation in ectotherms: Linking
life history, physiology, behaviour and genetics
(ThermAdapt). Information, particularly a sum-
mary of the scope of the programme, is now
available at http://www.esf.org/esf article.php?
language=0&activity=1&domain=3&articlea0&page04.
The Objective of this ESF Programme is to foster a
multidisciplinary European network of scientists work-
ing on thermal adaptation. We particularly aim to inte-
grate research at multiple levels of investigation, includ-
ing genetics, physiology, ecology, behaviour or theory.
Interested persons or groups are encouraged to join our
activities. These include advertising their expertise via
our web site, and participation in various activities to
be announced separately and regularly over the next
5 years such as workshops, training courses, short and
long exchange grants, exchange of specimens and ex-
pertise, sharing of facilities, and scientiﬁc collaboration
of any kind.
We here start with a Call for Applications for a number
of
Short Visits ( <= 15 days) and Exchange Grants (from
15 days to 3 months)
broadly related to the scientiﬁc objectives of the Pro-
gramme (deadline 15 February 2007). Short Vis-
its may serve for planning collaborative research
projects, brief data gathering or data analysis; the
longer-term Exchange Grants typically involve plan-
ning and execution of a larger collaborative re-
search project (see http://www.esf.org/generic/1817/-
Annex5GuidelinesforGrants.pdf for application guide-
lines and forms; under special circumstances stays
longer than 3 months may be possible).
Similar calls are planned to occur repeatedly over the
next 5 years. We advise applicants to contact poten-
tial labs of interest early to jointly prepare the appli-
cation. Grant applications will be chosen by the Steer-
ing Committee based on scientiﬁc quality, and priority
will be given to applicants who come from or intend
to visit countries supporting the programme (Austria,
Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia,Spain, Switzerland), but other European nations can
be involved.

Montpellier NematodeBacteria
Symbiosis
Postdoctoral position in the Institute for the Study of
Evolution in Montpellier (France)
We seek a post-doctoral fellow for a ANR funded
project on experimental evolution of the symbiosis be-tween nematodes and bacteria. This is a full-time
18 months position that will open in February 2007.
Salary is around 2100 euros/month.
Nematodes of the genus Steinernema are insect para-
sites. They infect insect larvae, reproduce in the larvae
they killed and disperse in soil in the search of a new
host to parasitize. These nematodes carry bacteria of
the genus Xenorhabdus in their gut. They release these
bacteria upon entering the insect larvae. Bacteria then
multiply and it has been shown that they greatly con-
tribute to killing the insect host. The presence of the
bacteria therefore increases nematodes’ success during
the parasitic stage of their life cycle. Recent research
has shown that bacteria are conversely costly to the
nematode during the free stage of their life cycle: the
mortality of dispersing nematodes increases with the
number of bacteria they carry.
The candidate will join our research team to setup and
run an experiment where environmental conditions are
varied so that the cost and beneﬁts of carrying bacteria
are changed. The evolution of the number of bacteria
nematodes carry will then be followed over time. The
candidate will be assisted in his work by two half-time
technicians and will work with a PhD student.
Please send a cv, names and contact information of
three references. Only complete applications will be
accepted. The complete description of the research
project is available at http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/-

UHawaii DamselﬂyVision
POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER TO STUDY VI-December 1, 2006 EvolDir 77
SUAL TARGET DETECTION IN HAWAIIAN DAM-
SELFLIES
UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII. I am seeking a highly mo-
tivated postdoc to work on a newly funded project
to study visual target detection behavior, morphology,
and visual performance in damselﬂies.
The Hawaiian damselﬂy genus Megalagrion is an en-
demic adaptive radiation with extensive color variation
and extreme ecological diversiﬁcation in terms of breed-
ing habitat (light environment). Vision is important
for foraging (identifying insect prey), identifying sexual
partners (females are often cryptic), as well as avoiding
predators. Thus, learning the fundamental mechanisms
by which these animals with simple visual systems ac-
complish very diﬃcult visual tasks may have broad im-
plications for their ecology and evolution, in addition
to possible practical applications.
Central Theme: How are damselﬂies able to detect ob-
jects of interest in cluttered and often dark environ-
ments, even when the objects are cryptic and possibly
stationary?
The speciﬁc aims of the project are: 1) Characterization
of visual targets in their natural light environments.
2) Characterization of targeting behavior in the ﬁeld
and/or laboratory. 3) Stimulus-response tests to assess
relative importance of size, color contrast, illuminance,
and motion. 4) Localization of foveal region of the eye
based on external morphology. 5) High-speed video
studies in the laboratory to quantify head and body
movement kinematics of responses to visual stimuli.
Subsidiary questions: are small visual cues are more ef-
fective than large ones, the mechanism by which dam-
selﬂies locate objects in 3D (do they use “peering”?),
whether species possess adaptations for low- light vs.
high-light environments (and indeed, which aspects of
the visual system are “mutable” by adaptive evolution),
and sexual dimorphisms of the visual system.
Candidates should have the following: Good commu-
nication/ interpersonal skills, good experimental skills
and experience in either animal behavior, visual or neu-
rophysiology, or kinematic analysis using high-speed
video. Experience with insects a plus.
Candidates interested in extending the project to ad-
dress major questions in behavior, sensory physiology,
or evolutionary ecology are particularly welcome.
Opportunities for exploring visual neurophysiology ex-
ist through collaboration with colleagues in the depart-
ment of Zoology and the Bekesy Laboratory of Neuro-
biology.
The Butler lab, recently relocated to the Departmentof Zoology at the University of Hawaii, studies the evo-
lution of morphology from functional, structural, and
adaptive (evolutionary) perspectives. Other projects in
the lab include: the evolution of sexual dimorphism in
lizards and damelﬂies, locomotor biomechanics and the
physical eﬀects of pregnancy in lizards, opsin evolution
in damelﬂies, and direct modeling approaches to phy-
logenetic comparative methods.
We have a dynamic network of colleagues and resources
available via: the Bishop Museum, Paciﬁc Biomedical
Research Center, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology,
Kewalo Marine Laboratory, Paciﬁc Center for Emerg-
ing Infectious Diseases Research, as well as the Bekesy
Laboratory of Neurobiology.
Appointment is initially for one year, renewable for sec-
ond year based on satisfactory performance. Competi-
tive stipend and student health plan available.
E-mail inquiries are welcome to mbutler@hawaii.edu
Applications (preferably by e-mail) should include
cover letter, CV, names and contact info for 3 ref-
erences, pdf’s of two most signiﬁcant publications or
manuscripts.
Review of applications begins December 1, 2006 and
will continue until ﬁlled.

POSTDOCTORAL position in PHYLOGENETIC
COMPARATIVE METHODS
University of Hawaii University of Michigan
We seek postdocs to work on our NSF funded project to
develop new tools for comparative analysis, particularly
for the purpose of studying adaptive evolution.
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck methods for Comparative Hy-
potheses (OUCH) is aimed at providing a comprehen-
sive and explicit modeling framework within which bi-
ologists can test hypotheses of adaptive evolution for78 EvolDir December 1, 2006
continuous characters. The approach is based upon a
model that allows for multiple selective regimes, each
parameterized by an optimal trait value, as well as over-
all strengths of selection and drift. One can arrange se-
lective regimes arbitrarily on a phylogenetic tree. This
ﬂexibility allows hypotheses of arbitrary complexity to
be translated directly into statistical models and con-
fronted with data. We have applied information-based
model-selection techniques to rigorously compare mul-
tiple alternative hypotheses. This allows ﬁne discrimi-
nation among alternatives – alternatives that may diﬀer
only in the regimes speciﬁed on a branch of particular
interest. Because of these features, the method allows
detailed exploration of historical diﬀerences, whether
such hypotheses depend on a speciﬁc ordering of selec-
tive regimes, or a particular ecological or biogeograph-
ical association.
Project Objectives: 1) Application of OUCH to exist-
ing comparative datasets to better illustrate its ana-
lytical power and gain new insight into speciﬁc ques-
tions in evolutionary biology. 2) Deveopment of the-
ory for bivariate, multivariate, and frequency data. 3)
Development of strategies for concurrently accounting
for uncertainty in the phylogeny. 4) Investigation of
statistical properties of the methods. 5) Modules writ-
ten to port these methods into the Mesquite package.
6) Improvements to our project’s web pages. 7) Con-
tinued support and distribution of our existing open-
source software (in R) for the methods.
We welcome inquiries from motivated individuals in-
terested in adaptive evolution, phylogenetic methods,
and/or mathematical modeling who will contribute to
a dynamic interdisciplinary team. Applications are wel-
come from both empirically- and theoretically- oriented
researchers.
Applicants should have a strong background in ei-
ther testing evolutionary hypotheses or in mathemat-
ical modeling as it relates to evolutionary biology or
ecology. Excellent communication abilities and good
interpersonal skills are necessary. Some experience in
programming is required.
Desired Qualiﬁcations: Experience in comparative phy-
logenetic methods (especially OUCH) and/ or mathe-
matical modeling.
Compensation: salary will be competitive. A student
health plan is available.
Project location: University of Hawaii with Marguerite
Butler, and/or University of Michigan with Aaron
King.
To apply, send a cover letter, CV, pdfs of most relevant
publications or preprints, and the names and contactinformation of three references to: Marguerite Butler

UHelsinki EvolDynamics
Postdoctoral position - University of Helsinki Disper-
sal and species invasions: combining experiments with
modelling
A postdoctoral position is available for 3 years in the
Laboratory of Ecological and Evolutionary Dynamics
(LEED), led by prof. Hanna Kokko and funded by the
Academy of Finland. LEED ( http://www.helsinki.ﬁ/-
˜ hmkokko/LEED.html ) is a strongly international re-
search group in which evolutionary questions are linked
to their population dynamic consequences, and the em-
phasis varies from developing theoretical tools to data
analysis and experimental work.
The postdoctoral project considers the evolution of dis-
persal and space use with the aim of predicting species
ranges in a changing world, using the invasive Colorado
Potato Beetle (CPB) as a model organism. As the CPB
is a pest species, the project has relevance for both ap-
plied and pure scientiﬁc questions. The scientiﬁc frame-
work can be found in the following publication:
Kokko, H. & L´ opez-Sepulcre, A. 2006. From individual
dispersal to species ranges: perspectives for a changing
world. Science 313:789- 791
The project forms a collaboration with researchers be-
tween universities of Helsinki, Jyv¨ askyl¨ a (central Fin-
land) and Bremen (northern Germany); the postdoc-
toral researcher will be based in Helsinki but with fre-
quent visits to the other universities. A good candidate
should have good skills in planning and carrying outDecember 1, 2006 EvolDir 79
experimental work, and be keen to consider theoretical
aspects of species invasion. Particular theoretical skills
are not required at this stage (i.e. experimental skills
are more important), since LEED oﬀers strong exper-
tise in the theoretical area, and oﬀers an environment
where such skills can be gained.
The CPB has invaded Europe since the 1930s, but
is not yet established in Finland. Suitable habitats
(potato ﬁelds) are patchy, and all potential sites are
known within southern Finland. Range expansion at
species margins can be very sensitive to small changes
in behaviour. While researchers at Jyv¨ askyl¨ a already
have results on e.g. trade-oﬀs between fecundity and
pesticide resistance (for project description see http://-
www.cc.jyu.ﬁ/˜mappes/research/colorado/ ), dispersal
parameters are lacking, and it is clearly important to
know if a beetle landing in a random location can re-
spond adaptively: one has to quantify mate-searching
and resource-searching abilities of males (of diﬀerent
life history stages) as well as mated and unmated fe-
males. Much of beetle dispersal happens passively
(wind-assisted in stormy weather) and establishment
attempts are always reported to authorities, which to-
gether with the detailed resource maps creates good op-
portunities to understand the process of species range
shifts. The beetles rarely alight, and wind tunnel exper-
iments can therefore be used to estimate the willingness
for long-distance dispersal. This can be combined with
experiments on movement in matrix habitat. Exper-
imentation in the ﬁeld is not possible because of the
pest status of the species, therefore the results will be
scaled up using modelling tools to match weather pat-
terns and known past invasions. Finally, the study will
proceed to simulating alternative future scenarios, tak-
ing advantage of known actual spatial structure of all
the resources available to the beetle. Wherever possi-
ble, modelling will also allow us to derive more general
results on the evolutionary ecology of species at their
range edges.
The position is for 3 years, with a ﬂexible start date
(anytime from April 2007 onwards). Applicants should
send an application that includes an explanation of rel-
evant experience and a CV to hanna.kokko@helsinki.ﬁ,
and contact details of two or preferably three persons
who could provide letters of reference. Copies of rel-
evant earlier publications can also be useful. There is
no strict deadline, as the position will be ﬁlled once a
suitable candidate has been found. Applications can
also be sent by post (see the website www.helsinki.ﬁ/-

p.a.
A Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA) is required
for three years to work on a BBSRC-funded project en-
titled Aphid secondary symbionts: from model system
to crop pests. It has recently been shown that faculta-
tive bacterial (secondary) symbionts have a remarkably
wide range of eﬀects on the biology of their aphid hosts.
These include increasing resistance to natural enemies,
improved performance on certain host plants, and re-
sistance to heat shock. We seek a post doc. to help
explore this symbiosis. The project involves the exper-
imental creation of novel aphid-symbiont combinations
to investigate how host and bacterial genotypes inter-
act to aﬀect aphid ﬁtness and how the symbiont may
inﬂuence clonal competition and aphid population dy-
namics under diﬀerent environmental conditions. The
vast majority of studies of secondary symbionts have in-
volved the model species, the pea aphid. In this project
we shall also explore whether secondary symbionts sim-
ilarly aﬀect the ﬁtness of a major cereal aphid pest, and
whether symbionts may inﬂuence indirect interactions
between aphid species mediated by natural enemies.
You should have a PhD and a background in evolution-
ary or community ecology, ideally with some experience
working with insects. You should have experience in
basic molecular genetic techniques and the analysis of
molecular data. You would join a group of people using
aphids as a model system to explore diﬀerent questions
in evolutionary biology and community ecology, and
should enjoy working as part of a team.

Postdoc opportunity: population genetics of urban pi-
geons
A one year post-doctoral position is available in the
Ecology, Systematic and Evolution laboratory of Uni-
versity Paris 11 (located in the suburb of Paris, France),
to work on the population genetics of urban pigeons.
The subject proposed to the postdoc is part of a bigger
project on urban biodiversity. One of the main goals
of conservation biology is to study Human-Nature re-
lationships, in order to allow sustainable development
and biodiversity conservation. Feral urban pigeons rep-
resent a very good model in this context, since the pres-
ence of pigeons in cities is depending on diﬀerent civic
actors defending opposite arguments for and against
pigeon’s presence. Pigeons breeding structures (with
abundant food but where reproduction is controlled),
installed in many urban cities as a management and me-
diation response, oﬀer an interesting design to answer
both biological and social questions. We are studying
how these breeding structures modify urban pigeon’s
population dynamics and selective pressures on this
species and how these structures inﬂuence citizen per-
ceptions about pigeons The postdoc is expected to work
in the following areas :(i) Determination of the popu-
lation structure of urban pigeons using microsatellites
and comparison of the variability of urban pigeons with
those of the remaining wild birds, (ii) study of the in-
ﬂuence of urban habitat heterogeneity (e.g. in terms
of resource availability, level of pollution and parasite
loads on neutral (microsatellite) and non neutral (ma-
jor histocompatibility complex) genetic variability.

School of Biological Sciences,
Faculty of Science
89917
Following the award of an ARC Discovery Grant, the
University’s School of Biological Sciences and School
of Information Technology are undertaking an exciting
interdisciplinary research project.
We delighted to invite applicants from talented post-
doctoral researchers in the ﬁeld of phylogenetics for a
2.5 year position, starting in the ﬁrst half of 2007.
Here is a brief summary: This project will answer a
long-debated question in biology, that of the origin and
evolution of the animals.
The debate stems from a perceived conﬂict between the
fossil record, which suggests an origin around 543 mil-
lion years ago (Mya), and the molecular record, which
suggests an origin 750-1000 Mya. The molecular record
has proved diﬃcult to untangle because the methods
used so far are unable to deal with the complexity of
genomic data.
Using an interdisciplinary bioinformatic approach, in-
volving computer science, statistics and biology, we will
extend the use of mixed models to describe evolutionary
dynamics in multi-gene data, and, with them, analyse
nuclear genomes to determine the origin and evolutionof modern animals.
While this is primarily a research role, the appointed
individual will be encouraged to develop their teaching,
lecturing and post graduate supervisory skills. In ad-
dition, they will be expected to publish on a regular
basis with regard to the development of new method-
ologies and software that enables the creation, analysis
and evaluation of complex models.
To be eligible for appointment, individuals will have
recently completed a PhD in phylogenics or a related
bioinformatics area; and have proven skills in mathe-
matical/statistical analysis and coding (C++).
This is a not-to-be missed opportunity for a pas-
sionate bioinformatics researcher to participate in
ground breaking discovery research and work with
highly regarded specialists in this emerging ﬁeld.

(which includes a base salary Level A $61,117 - $65,605
p.a., leave loading and up to 17% employer’s contribu-
tion to superannuation)
The position is ﬁxed term for 2.5 years subject to the
completion of a satisfactory probation period for new

Orkun Soyer <soyer@cosbi.eu >UTurku Moth Population dynamics
A Postdoctoral Position (one year) - Section of Ecology,
University of Turku, Finland
Project: Cyclic population dynamics of the autumnal
moth: biology and importance of parasitic wasps. Led
by Academy Research Fellow, Dr. Tero Klemola.
The project continues a rich tradition at the University
of Turku. Earlier projects, since 1970s, have looked
for an explanation for cyclic population dynamics, e.g.,
from intrinsic changes of autumnal moth populations
at successive cycle phases and particularly from mul-
tifaceted interactions with the main host plant, the
mountain birch. However, the working hypothesis
of our current project suggests that delayed density-
dependent mortality due to egg, larval and/or pupal
parasitism governs the cyclic population dynamics. We
concentrate on the parasitism aspect, with the aim of
understanding the biology of hymenopteran parasitoid
species involved in the system. Their trophic interac-
tions with autumnal moths and mountain birches are
examined by large-scale ﬁeld sampling and by labora-
tory and ﬁeld experiments. Together with taxonomists,
we also explore the taxonomy of these relatively poorly
known insects. Our research project has been granted
funding from the Academy of Finland for years 2005-
2010.
The candidate will be able to continue within the al-
ready established studies. However, there is also scope
for developing new questions and/or methodological ap-
proaches relating to the system, something we would
very much encourage. A good candidate may have ex-
pertise, for example, in one or more of the following
topics: population cycles of herbivores, ecological ento-
mology, ecology and behaviour of hymenopteran para-
sitoids, construction of mathematical population mod-
els with empirical data or statistical time series anal-
yses. Evidence of a proven ability to publish scientiﬁc
results is desired. An empirically inclined candidate
may work with us at the Kevo Subarctic Research Sta-
tion located in northernmost Finland during the ﬁeld
season (1-3 months in summer).
This postdoctoral position has funding for 1 year (ap-
proximately 2500 /month depending on experience).
The position will be ﬁlled from mid-April 2007 onwards
with a ﬂexible start date (preferably before the ﬁeld
work period starts in June). Several possibilities exist84 EvolDir December 1, 2006
for applying for additional funding once the candidate
is at work.

Dear colleague,
In a co-operative project between University of Utrecht
and the Netherlands Institute of Ecology there is a va-
cancy for a postdoc on behaviour-based and epidemi-
ological modeling of avian inﬂuenza in populations of
migratory birds
The postdoc will be working on the project ˆ aCombining
behaviour-based and epidemiological models to iden-
tity the role of Arctic breeding migratory birds in the
ecology of diseases, notably Avian Inﬂuenzaˆ a within
the Theoretical Epidemiology group of the Depart-
ment of Farm Animal Health, University of Utrecht.
Detailed information on this vacancy can be obtained

The project is funded by the Netherlands Organi-
sation for Scientiﬁc Research NWO (Earth and Life
Sciences) in its International Polar Year program.
The work will be conducted in close co-operation with
the department of Plant-Animal interactions of theNetherlands Institute of Ecology, the Department of
Virology of Erasmus University - Rotterdam, and the
Arctic Centre - Groningen University. The project is
part of a suite of projects called BIRDHEALTH.
We are looking for an enthusiastic candidate with a
PhD degree in the ﬁeld of population biology or epi-
demiology. You have substantial experience in math-
ematical modeling, preferably within the ﬁeld of epi-
demiology or metapopulation dynamics. Because of
the multidisciplinary character of the parent project
you should be able to collaborate closely with epidemi-
ologists, virologists, waterfowl and behavioural ecolo-
gists and theoreticians. You have good communication
and writing skills, especially in English, and are a good
player in a team of PhD-students and postdocs.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.

This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
