McMasterU GermLineMutations
We seek a M.Sc. student for a collaborative study of
fathead minnows that we will cage in situ near a histor-
ical coal tar spill (Randle Reef) and at reference sites
near by in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario, and then
return to the laboratory for follow-up evaluation. The
longer-term goal is to assess the genetic damage, long-
term developmental eﬀects, and reproductive eﬀects in
ﬁsh caused by exposure to Randle Reef water and sed-
iment before, during, and after the Randle Reef clean-
up operation. The student will gain experience expos-
ing fathead minnows to sediments, and rearing ﬁsh oﬀ-
spring to assess heritable mutations. We will examine
germ-line mutations in tandem repeat DNA as well as
vitellogenin levels, developmental deformities, and sur-
vival of the exposed adults’ fry. Transfer to a Ph.D.program may be possible depending upon the timing
of the spill clean-up. The student will be based in the
Biology Department at McMaster University and will
work part of the time with our collaborators, Environ-
ment Canada Scientists, at Canada Centre for Inland
Waters. Please send Cover letter, CV, Transcripts, and

Applications are being sought for one student inter-
ested in pursuing an academic career studying behav-
ioral ecology (mate choice and sperm use) of sailﬁn
and Amazon mollies starting fall 2005. Amazon mol-
lies, Poecilia formosa, are a unisexual (all female) ﬁsh
species that are parasitic on the closely related bisexual
sailﬁn molly, P. latipinna. Conﬂict exists between male
sailﬁn mollies trying to mate with their own species,
and the unisexual females trying to appropriate a mat-
ing from these males. Dr. Andrea Aspbury and I have
NSF funding (2 full summers) and departmental teach-
ing assistantships (2 academic years) for a masters re-
search assistant to work on this system. See http:/-
/www.bio.txstate.edu/˜gabor/gabor.htm andhttp://-
www.bio.txstate.edu/˜gabor/aspbury/aspbury.htm for
details about our research interests.

in evolutionary ecology as the basis for training in be-
havioral ecology. Students will beneﬁt from interactions
with other faculty interested in evolutionary questions:
Dr. Jim Ott (Insect-plant interactions and ecological
genetics), Dr. Susan Schwinning (Plant ecology), Dr.Mike Forstner (Vertebrate systematics and population
genetics), and Dr. Chris Nice (Speciation in insects and
phylogeography).
San Marcos, Texas is located 30 miles South of Austin,
the Live Music Capitol. Both San Marcos and Austin
are rich cultural and recreational environments in which
to live and study. The Texas State campus overlooks
the city of San Marcos and the headwaters of the crys-
tal clear San Marcos River ( http://www.continuing-
ed.swt.edu/aquarena/photo.html ). San Marcos and
Austin are NOT the Texas you see or think of from
TV!

PhD position in Population Ecology8 EvolDir August 1, 2005
Regulation of local bird populations: deeper insights
from integrated population models
A 3-year PhD project is available at the Division
of Conservation Biology of the University of Bern,
Switzerland.
An opening for a PhD position is available from 1st
October 2005. The position is funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation. The general aim of the
study is to advance integrated population models in
order to model the dynamics of local populations. In-
tegrated population models are of growing interest as
they make simultaneous use of diﬀerent kinds of data
allowing the estimation of otherwise inaccessible demo-
graphic parameters. The population models shall be
developed such that they are suited to analyse popula-
tion dynamics of a typical short-lived passerine bird
(red-back shrike Lanius collurio) and of a long-lived
species with delayed recruitment (white stork Ciconia
ciconia). From both species long time data series are
available.
The ideal candidate is a very motivated graduate stu-
dent with strong skills in quantitative data analysis and
a deep understanding in mathematics. Ideally the can-
didate has knowledge in Bayesian statistics. The can-
didate does not need to have a biological education, ap-
plications of graduated mathematicians or statisticians

The Department of Biology and Chemistry at the Uni-
versity of Bremen is oﬀering a
Ph.D. Position in ecology and evolution of marine cope-
pods
starting on 1 September 2005 and at ﬁrst restricted to 1
year. Salary is according to the German public service
pay scale BAT IIa/2.
The project Biodiversity and ecology of deep-sea cope-
pods in polar seas speciation processes and ecological
niches in the homogeneous environment of the pelagic
realm“ (funded by the German Science Foundation) fo-
cuses on the ecological niches and evolution of dominant
deep-sea copepods in the Antarctic and Arctic.
The project aims at an improved understanding of
causes and mechanisms sustaining a surprisingly high
biodiversity at meso- and bathypelagic depths despite
the very limited food supply and the absence of physical
barriers. Modern molecular genetic techniques (DNA
sequencing) are applied to study phylogenetic relation-
ships, while biochemical methods (trophic biomarker
fatty acids, stable isotopes) are used to elucidate diﬀer-
ences in feeding behaviour and dietary composition of
sympatric species.
Tasks: In co-operation with the PIs, Dr. H. Auel (ma-
rine zoology) and Dr. M. Kochzius (molecular genet-
ics), the candidate will investigate the vertical distribu-
tion of deep-sea copepods in both polar regions. She/he
will conduct feeding experiments and respiration mea-
surements on board. To study dietary spectra, trophic
marker fatty acids and stable isotopes will be analysed.
Phylogenetic relationships will be studied by molecular
markers. We envisage collaboration with international
biodiversity initiatives, such as CoML, CMarZ, Zoogen,
and BOL.
Requirements: The candidate must have a M.Sc. or
German Diploma degree in biology with special qual-
iﬁcations in marine biology, biological oceanography,
molecular genetics, or a related ﬁeld. We are looking for
a highly motivated and dedicated person with a broad
interest in the ecology and evolution of marine organ-
isms. She/he must be able to organise and implement
the work programme eﬃciently and independently. The
project oﬀers the chance to combine ﬁeld work at sea
with state-of-the-art laboratory analytics in biochem-August 1, 2005 EvolDir 9
istry and molecular genetics. Therefore, we prefer a
young scientist with experiences in both ﬁelds. Will-
ingness and ability to participate in sea-going expedi-
tions of several months are required, as well as ﬂuent
oral and written English language skills. Basic German
would be an advantage, but is not necessary. Know-how
and practical skills in experimental work with zooplank-
ton, especially copepods, and molecular genetic and/or
lipidbiochemical methods (DNA sequencing, gas chro-
matography) would be an advantage. In addition, ex-
perience in ship-borne expeditions is welcome.
We are planning to extend the post for another 24
months, but this is still subject to approval by the
German Science Foundation (DFG). The University of
Bremen is an equal opportunity employer. Female can-
didates are encouraged to apply. Handicapped persons
will be preferred if they show the same professional and
personal qualiﬁcations.
Applications including a letter of motivation, CV, pho-
tograph, and transcripts of certiﬁcates, as well as con-
tact addresses of two potential referees shall be sub-
mitted under the key word COPS to: Dr. Holger Auel,

ABI377 ﬁrmware
Dear all few days ago we disgracefully deleted the col-
lection software from our old and (at that moment) per-
fectly working ABI 377. We downloaded from the ABI
website a copy of the collection softare available online
(2.5 the same version of our old one), and we properly
installed it. Following installing instructions the new
ﬁrmware was sent to the machine that now seems to
recognize the mac again and makes no problems in any
setteling operation. The problem is that even if we try
to make runs, pre-runs and plate checks the main col-
lection window and the gel image are staying perfectly
white and untouched, even if the mac says that the laser
is correctly running, and the seq make is nice sound...
can anybody help us in solving this unespected trouble?

Beckman CEQ8000 query answers
Dear Evoldir members,
Thank you for sharing your experience of using Beck-
man vers ABI! Apparently there was a similar ques-
tion on Evoldir a few months ago. Margaret Ptacek
have kindly sent me a summary of the previous opin-
ions, which is included below together with the new re-
sponses (hence, it is quite a long “summary”, but this
seems to be the question which interests many people).
My own experience from many years with ABI and one
week demo with CEQ8000:
The hardware is generally similar, but Beckmans are
simpler in use and service (and cheaper); chemistry
seems to be the weak side for beckmans - it is more sen-
sitive to DNA/primer concentrations and it takes more
time and eﬀort to optimise the reactions for beckmans,
compared to ABI. It is also not so easy to dilute/scale
down the sequencing reactions with beckmans, hence20 EvolDir August 1, 2005
the running costs may be somewhat higher compared
to ABI.
All the best,
Dmitry Filatov

========= I was interested to see your question
on EvolDir since I just ordered a CEQ 8000 this week.
I’ve worked extensively with ABI systems up til now,
and so I can send you my thoughts on the two systems.
Without a doubt, ABI systems are good. I was in
France for the last two years, and while there I pur-
chased a 4 capillary 3100. They have made many hard-
ware improvements since the days of the 310. One thing
which is still a pain is their syringe-gel-loading system
(this may have changed in the last year). They have
automated this with a software wizard, but I still ﬁnd
it easier to do manually. One nonetheless still loses sig-
niﬁcant amounts of polymer while trying to get all the
air bubbles out of the system. The glass syringes are
also expensive and easily breakable, and so you should
have at least one extra syringe (of both sizes) ordered
if diﬀerent users will be using the system.
Their software has improved as well, although it is still
quite complicated to use. Furthermore the new soft-
ware is connected with an Oracle database, which is
naturally useful for huge sequencing factories but which
may be overkill for smaller laboratories. You need a
new and fast windows 2000 computer with at least 1
GB RAM to get it to work. The ﬁnal negative aspect
of their software is the cost (very very expensive) and
the fact that you are not ?oﬃcially? allowed to install it
on diﬀerent computers (unless you buy more expensive
licences). They have gone the ?Microsoft? way since
the various software components are all bundled now,
so you can?t get away from buying the whole package
for fragment sizing and fragment analysis. What was
once possible was to only buy the GeneScan software
for fragment sizing, but then not buying their Geno-
typer software since there are free packages available
on the net to do fragment analysis (Genographer, for
example).
The laser question is a signiﬁcant one. I wasn?t in
France long enough for me to experience the laser wear-
ing out, but I was in Munich in 1997 when our 310?s
laser did die, and it was very expensive to replace.
This was one positive thought for the CEQ system,
which has a longer lasting diode laser system (or so
they say?.).As far as I can tell, the capillaries are similar between
both systems. They both say that they arrays are good
for 100 runs, but you should just use them until they
die (I had one up to 850 runs on our 310).
The 5 dye system of ABI is of course better than the
4 dye system of the CEQ, but this is balanced by the
costs of the labels, which are quite expensive for the
ABI. They don?t have exclusive rights to all the dyes
though, and so you can order at least 3 of the 5 from
other companies for less money. I was recently running
6 to 8 microsatellite loci per run on an ABI 9600, with
two loci per color if you develop the primers to give you
non overlapping products (e.g. locus one 100 to 200 bp;
locus two 300 to 400 bp).
ABI size standards are expensive, although there are
ways around this by making your own (if you?re in-
terested there was another recent EvolDir email about
this, which I can send you if you need).
Despite all of this, I still like their systems because they
are reliable and you are guaranteed to get good data
from them without wasting too much time. It?s just a
matter of getting used to setting up the hardware and
ﬁguring out the software.
So I just opted for the CEQ 8000. My decision is based
upon the fact that I?m setting up my own group, and
so funding is not unlimited. I?ve never worked with

Catholic evolutionist response
Science shouldn’t care about the position of the
Catholic Church on evolution, nor should they take a
position on the Catholic Church at all. Science has no
power to evaluate religion, as religion makes its claims
on faith, where science is restricted to empirical phe-
nomenon. Neither one has any power to evaluate thetruth within the other. This basic tenant has seemingly
been neglected by many involved in this Neo-Scopes
Monkey Trial.

CatholicChurch policy on Evolution
Not surprising, but discouraging.
““““““““““““““““““““““‘
NY Times, July 7, 2005 Finding Design in Nature By
CHRISTOPH SCH ¨ONBORN Vienna
EVER since 1996, when Pope John Paul II said that
evolution (a term he did not deﬁne) was “more than just
a hypothesis,” defenders of neo-Darwinian dogma have
often invoked the supposed acceptance - or at least ac-
quiescence - of the Roman Catholic Church when they
defend their theory as somehow compatible with Chris-
tian faith.
But this is not true. The Catholic Church, while leav-
ing to science many details about the history of life on
earth, proclaims that by the light of reason the human
intellect can readily and clearly discern purpose and de-
sign in the natural world, including the world of living
things.
Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be
true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense - an
unguided, unplanned process of random variation and
natural selection - is not. Any system of thought that
denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evi-
dence for design in biology is ideology, not science.
Consider the real teaching of our beloved John Paul.
While his rather vague and unimportant 1996 letter
about evolution is always and everywhere cited, we see
no one discussing these comments from a 1985 general
audience that represents his robust teaching on nature:
“All the observations concerning the development of life
lead to a similar conclusion. The evolution of living be-
ings, of which science seeks to determine the stages and
to discern the mechanism, presents an internal ﬁnality
which arouses admiration. This ﬁnality which directs
beings in a direction for which they are not responsible
or in charge, obliges one to suppose a Mind which is its
inventor, its creator.”
He went on: “To all these indications of the existence of22 EvolDir August 1, 2005
God the Creator, some oppose the power of chance or of
the proper mechanisms of matter. To speak of chance
for a universe which presents such a complex organiza-
tion in its elements and such marvelous ﬁnality in its
life would be equivalent to giving up the search for an
explanation of the world as it appears to us. In fact,
this would be equivalent to admitting eﬀects without
a cause. It would be to abdicate human intelligence,
which would thus refuse to think and to seek a solution
for its problems.”
Note that in this quotation the word “ﬁnality” is a
philosophical term synonymous with ﬁnal cause, pur-
pose or design. In comments at another general audi-
ence a year later, John Paul concludes, “It is clear that
the truth of faith about creation is radically opposed to
the theories of materialistic philosophy. These view the
cosmos as the result of an evolution of matter reducible
to pure chance and necessity.”
Naturally, the authoritative Catechism of the Catholic
Church agrees: “Human intelligence is surely already
capable of ﬁnding a response to the question of origins.
The existence of God the Creator can be known with
certainty through his works, by the light of human rea-
son.” It adds: “We believe that God created the world
according to his wisdom. It is not the product of any
necessity whatever, nor of blind fate or chance.”
In an unfortunate new twist on this old controversy,
neo-Darwinists recently have sought to portray our new
pope, Benedict XVI, as a satisﬁed evolutionist. They
have quoted a sentence about common ancestry from a
2004 document of the International Theological Com-
mission, pointed out that Benedict was at the time head
of the commission, and concluded that the Catholic
Church has no problem with the notion of “evolution”
as used by mainstream biologists - that is, synonymous
with neo-Darwinism.
The commission’s document, however, reaﬃrms the
perennial teaching of the Catholic Church about the
reality of design in nature. Commenting on the
widespread abuse of John Paul’s 1996 letter on evo-
lution, the commission cautions that “the letter cannot
be read as a blanket approbation of all theories of evo-
lution, including those of a neo-Darwinian provenance
which explicitly deny to divine providence any truly
causal role in the development of life in the universe.”
Furthermore, according to the commission, “An un-
guided evolutionary process - one that falls outside the
bounds of divine providence - simply cannot exist.”
Indeed, in the homily at his installation just a few weeks
ago, Benedict proclaimed: “We are not some casual and
meaningless product of evolution. Each of us is the re-sult of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of
us is loved, each of us is necessary.”
Throughout history the church has defended the truths
of faith given by Jesus Christ. But in the modern era,
the Catholic Church is in the odd position of standing in
ﬁrm defense of reason as well. In the 19th century, the
First Vatican Council taught a world newly enthralled
by the “death of God” that by the use of reason alone
mankind could come

The cardinal’s op-ed was apparently heavily inﬂuenced
by the Discovery Institute (the main pushers of “intelli-
gent design” creationism in the U.S.), and may not rep-
resent an impending shift in the views of the Catholic
Church, which has never been particularly into Paley
or neoPaleyism.

Sch¨ onborn text: It has now arrived in Austria, with a

day several updates and additional articles were posted
on “diepresse.com”, where Sch¨ onborn clariﬁes that he
mostly refers to a ﬁne-tuned universe and not to ID
in biology. Also, he strongly distanced himself from
every YEC-viewpoint. Quote (my translation): “You
cannot and may not act based on faith against knowl-
edge. Faith and knowledge are bever contradictory.
Attempts to reduce earths history to six days with
preposterous hypotheses are void of any seriousness.”
I think he got under heavy ﬁre and I think that this
was a surprise, given the number of updates and posts
in the austrian press. The general viewpoint was, that
the cardinal was far out of his depth and commenting
on things that are not his “magisterium”.

explainer What Catholics Think of Evolution They
don’t not believe in it. By Keelin McDonell Posted
Tuesday, July 12, 2005, at 3:19 PM PT
In a New York Times op-ed, Roman Catholic Cardinal
Christoph Sch ˜Awrote that it’s a misconception that the
Catholic Church believes in evolution. While conced-
ing that “[e]volution in the sense of common ancestry
might be true,” Sch ˜Aasserted that natural selection is
not compatible with church teachings. In a follow-up
article, several Catholic biologists refuted the cardinal’s
essay. What is the Catholic Church’s stance on evolu-
tion?
That it’s a ﬁne theory for explaining the natural world
as long as it doesn’t deny divine purpose and causal-
ity. The Catholic Church has never embraced biblical
literalism. That may be why, unlike evangelical Chris-
tian faiths, Catholics have never made creationism a
religious tenet. The church has produced letters, stud-
ies, encyclicals, and speeches in the last 100 years that
praise the scientiﬁc research behind the concept of evo-
lution. But it has never endorsed “belief” in evolution
by including it in the Catholic Catechism, the church’s
oﬃcial compendium of teachings and beliefs.
Largely due to its embarrassing condemnation of
Galileo in the 17th century, the church has since been
very cautious about responding to scientiﬁc theories. It
took the Vatican nearly a century to react formally toDarwin’s 1859 treatise The Origin of Species. The oﬃ-
cial response came in 1950, when Pope Pius XII wrote
in the encyclical Humani generis that “the Teaching
Authority of the Church does not forbid that ˆ a research
and discussions ˆ a take place with regard to the doc-
trine of evolution.” Some Catholic scholars say Pius
XII issued the encyclical as a response to the rise of
communism. Embracing evolution could have been the
Vatican’s way of heading oﬀ the atheistic Communist
Party, which might have used Darwin’s theories as evi-
dence that God doesn’t exist.
Between 1859 and 1950, several Catholic biologists tried
to reconcile evolution with church doctrine. In the
1920s, the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
made a controversial attempt to integrate the new sci-
ence with Catholic beliefs. His unorthodox views were
silenced, however, when his Jesuit superiors shipped
him oﬀ to do research in China. But around the same
time, a consensus started to develop among Catholic
biologists that evolution did not necessarily contradict
Catholic teachings.
The Vatican made no more major pronouncements un-
til the pontiﬁcate of John Paul II. In 1996, John Paul
sent a letter to the Pontiﬁcal Academy of Sciences not-
ing that there was “a signiﬁcant argument in favour
of this theory [of evolution].” At the same time, the
pope assigned the question of “ultimate meaning” to
theology. In 2002, the church’s International Theologi-
cal Commission, which convened to address challenges
posed by “scientiﬁc understanding and technological ca-
pability,” seemed to support John Paul’s statements.
“[A]ccording to the Catholic understanding of divine
causality,” the commission wrote, “true contingency in
the created order is not incompatible with a purposeful
divine providence.”
After Cardinal Sch ˜A’s op-ed was published last week,
he told the New York Times that it had not been ap-
proved by the Vatican. He also stated that there were
no plans to issue new guidelines on teaching evolution in
Catholic schools. Theological experts think that Sch ˜A’s
essay likely has more to do with Pope Benedict XVI’s
desire to caution Catholics against relativism than to
change the church’s thoughts on evolution.

Clariﬁcation Liberal view
Christianity
Dear Brian,
My two impulsive postings to EvolDir have generated
some totally unexpected responses - I was mistakenly
perceived to be antisemitic. Certain faculty members
in the States were contacting our university adminis-
tration and the Canadian Jewish Society to propagate
the misperception.
I have immense respect for many Jewish scientists in
population genetics and molecular evolution and do not
have any bad feelings against Jews. I believe that any-
one who knows me would agree with me.
My intention is to reconcile between science and religion
so as to avoid or at least reduce unnecessary misunder-
standing and confrontation.
I may have been insensitive. If I have oﬀended anyone
through the two postings, here is my sincere apology.
My postings do not represent the position of my de-
partment and my university.
I should be grateful if you could post this email with the

I need to use DNASsp for Fu and Li analyses of
mtDNA sequence and population data. Unfortunately,
I have only Macs available (G5’s and G4’s, with plenty
of memory and fast processors). I’m running OS X
10.3x (“Panther”) but am in the midst of switching to
“Tiger.” Several PC emulators are available for OS X,
including Virtual PC (now a Microsoft product), and
a new one with a very attractive price, Guest PC. The
DNAsp websites indicates that the program will run un-
der the former (though I think they are talking about
a version for the PowerPC, i.e. “Classic” OS 9.2).
I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has
tried, using either of these programs or any others, to
run DNAsp on a Mac, especially OS X. Did it work?
Was it abysmally slow? etc...
Thanks very much.

Dobzhansky Evolution Creation
The recent exchange on Evoldir has reminded me of
Dobzhansky’s famous 1973 essay in The American Biol-
ogy Teacher. While the title (Nothing in Biology Makes
Sense Except in the Light of Evolution) has been widely
quoted, there is much in the essay that is relevant here.
I am particularly fond of the following paragraph:
“Antievolutionists fail to understand how natural selec-
tion operates. They fancy that all existing species were
generated by supernatural ﬁat a few thousand years
ago, pretty much as we ﬁnd them today. But what is
the sense of having as many as 2 or 3 million species liv-
ing on earth? If natural selection is the main factor that
brings evolution about, any number of species is under-
standable: natural selection does not work according
to a foreordained plan, and species are produced not
because they are needed for some purpose but simply
because there is an environmental opportunity and ge-
netic wherewithal to make them possible. Was the Cre-
ator in a jocular mood when he made Psilopa petrolei
for California oil ﬁelds and species of Drosophila to live
exclusively on some body-parts of certain land crabs on
only certain islands in the Caribbean? The organic di-
versity becomes, however, reasonable and understand-
able if the Creator has created the living world not by
caprice but by evolution propelled by natural selection.
It is wrong to hold creation and evolution as mutu-
ally exclusive alternatives. I am a creationist and an
evolutionist. Evolution is God’s, or Nature’s method
of creation. Creation is not an event that happened
in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion
years ago and is still under way.”
To Dobzhansky, then, being a creationist and an evo-
lutionist were not mutually exclusive alternatives. Per-
sonally, I still don’t know exactly how I feel about it
all, but I ﬁnd that sentiment reassuring (and wish more
people felt the same and would stop hating on others
with a viewpoint other than their own).

Dear colleagues,
Could you please suggest protocols for DNA extraction
from oaks dried leaves?
We know that is better to extract from buds but we
have to extract from dried leaves because there is no
possibility to collect again samples.
We use the next protocol:
Grind 30mg dried leaf material
Add 1ml extraction buﬀer (ATMAB with mercap-
toethanol)
Leave at 60oC for 45 min with agitation
After cooling at room temperature for 10 min, add 400
m l ’wet’ chloroform and mix gently until an emulsion
is formed.
Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm at room temp for 8 minutes
and transfer upper, aqueous, phase to a clean tube.
Add 600 m l ice cold (20oC) Isopropanol and invert
tubes several times to precipitate the DNA. Tubes left
at20oC for 90 minutes.
Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 8 min to pellet the DNA.
Pour oﬀ supernatant and leave tubes upside down for
a few minutes to drain.
Wash pellets with 1ml of 76% ethanol leave at room
temperature for minimum of 60 mins (also possible to
leave overnight).
Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 8 min. Pour oﬀ super-
natant and air-dry pellets at room temp.
Dissolve DNA in 100 m l of autoclaved H2O.
The results for DNA extracted from dried oak leaves
are very poor but for buds it works well.
Hence, please suggest from your experience, how to op-
timize this protocol?
Thank you in advance.

Evol on Catholicism
Why should anyone take seriously the beliefs of mem-
bers of an organisation that derives its oﬃcial views
from documents written 2000 years ago, which lack any
independent support , and claim to record events such
as the virgin birth and the resurrection which violate
all that we know about biology?
Brian Charlesworth <brian.charlesworth@ed.ac.uk >Evolution Religion question
Hi,
I have read with interest the previous messages on Evo-
lution and Religion. I think there is a basic, simple
distinction to be made here, and I do think that the
’non-atheistic’ persons are somewhat reticent to clearly
state this: when you refer to “believing in Religion”,
you should clarify if:
1) You believe, as for example Einstein, in a ’God’ Na-
ture, or even a ’God’ Love, but without this implying
believing in the more speciﬁc, ’fantasy’ points referring
to your religion (e.g. if you are Christian, you believe
that a man, son of a virgin, died more than 2000 years
ago, revived after that, and is now somewhere in the
sky seeing us).
2) You believe actually in those speciﬁc points, i.e., if
you are Christian you believe in such speciﬁc points of
the bible, the opening of the seas, etc.
This is crucial to clarify this discussion. If you just
believe in an ’abstract’, ’God’ Nature, as Einstein, for
example, such believe has no contradiction with a scien-
tiﬁc vision of the world. However, people that actually
believe in such more speciﬁc points, such as the open-
ing of the seas by a man son of a virgin that died, re-
vived, and ﬂied to the sky to see us from above, should
CLEARLY state this and at least discuss how the be-
lieving in such things do not collide with a scientiﬁc
vision of the world. If a man can open the seas, or can
die, revive and ﬂy after that, than I really do not know
what I am doing in my lab during all day.
But this is my personal view of the subject, perhaps
someone can really conciliate such a believe in those
more speciﬁc points with a scientiﬁc view of the world.
I would thus just like to ask to those that really believe
in such speciﬁc points of their religions to write us and
explain how they can do that. I think, or at least I
hope, I am open minded, and I would just like to try to
understand this. You should understand that at least
for some of us it seems theoretically diﬃcult to concil-
iate such views, so it would be nice, I think, to hear
your arguments.

Evolutionist position 30
Dear Colleagues, If it can’t be subjected to the scientiﬁc
method then it isn’t science. Intelligent design and/or
creationism can be taught in a religion or philosophy
course, but not in a science course because neither can
be subjected to scientiﬁc inquiry. Thus they cannot be
objectively test. If they cannot be objectively tested
then we are not dealing with science. Thus, the issue is
not whether individual scientist believe themselves to
be above the realm of religion. The issue is whether
creationism or intelligent design is science; and as such,
can be taught in a science class. They are not and they
cannot. Although I enjoy a philosophical discussion as
well as the next person. I do think we should focus on
something that has been demonstrated so often that it
has become fact — evolution. Tracie

Dear colleagues,
With regard to the latest discussions on how to de-
fend evolutionism in the face of the teachings of catholic
leaders:
If there is one message that may actually make it
through the walls of the ivory towers, it may be the
humble but yet powerful concession that scientists do
not oﬀer ultimate, or complete knowledge. Yet, what
we produce tends to improve our understanding and
also the conditions of human life. To me, this is
the most important message to put forward in today’s
world of conﬂict between fundamentalist schools.
It should be made clear that ideas like “intelligent de-
sign” cannot be refuted scientiﬁcally. Rather, the whole
point of science is to ignore explanations that appeal to
spiritual powers, as I have come to see it. When some
people complain that scientists pretend there are no
metaphysical issues, I would argue that this is the very
strength of science. This is the method by which real
progress is made.
But with this view follows a certain kind of tolerance
for others who are not satisﬁed with incomplete knowl-
edge, or with purely materialist explanations. We must
accept that we leave room for spiritualistic and mystical
ideas.
The ﬁght for reason can not be reduced to the question
of origin of life. It is much more fundamental than this.
Indeed, it probably needs to be fought within many of
us every day, myself included.
Besides, I side with Richard Dawkins who insist that
rational explanations do not in any way reduce the won-
ders of the world. On the contrary, the beauty of the
(hypothetically) explained world is p robably our best
weapon.

Dear Colleagues passioned in this debate,
I also feel that there is lack of philosophical perspective28 EvolDir August 1, 2005
and rigour in the “easy” shortcuts to “scientiﬁcally”
deny a metaphysical universe - just as much as we may
not diminish the value of science itself using ethical or,
worse, emotional arguments! But I acknowledge the
social and political relevance of positions that take ad-
vantage of ignorance and misunderstandings to propose
a world where only one view of reality is acceptable. I
still like freedom of thought...

I am startled that anyone living in American society can
think, as Guy Hoelzer does, that “awareness of a plau-
sible material-only perspective should have a calming
inﬂuence over a smoldering situation.” The public has
been made aware of plausible material-only perspec-
tives for over a century, to little eﬀect. The diﬃculty
lies, in part, with the fact that the way people who
are not trained in science perceive the world is quite
counter to what science tells them; in fact even those
who accept the discoveries of science are largely “taking
it on faith”. We as scientists forget what it is like to
NOT have that training. We promulgate the problem
by teaching science to most people as a series of Facts
without giving any understanding of the experimental
and mathematical methods that let us develop those
facts from observations (many of which require sophis-
ticated instrumentation rather than the naked eye).
As a physicist colleague of mine once pointed out, the
ordinary person cannot accept the concept of inertia
EXCEPT on faith – in the everyday world, when you
roll a ball across a ﬂoor, it eventually stops. Even an
air hockey puck stops eventually. Aristotle noted it,
and for many centuries that was “the fact”. A student
who learns the concept of inertia generally is “taking it
on faith” unless they go on to a more in-depth study of
physics.
Thus we do very little to help our cause when we use
rhetoric that attempts to alienate science from religion.
[Even I, retaining the very healthy doubt instilled by my
Unitarian-Universalist upbringing, have to admit that
I *believe* that eventually all unexplained phenomena
will have a material explanation, but that’s a BELIEFbased on the fact that so far science seems to have been
able to ﬁnd a material explanation for so many things.
There is currently no scientiﬁc evidence that it will all
work out that way.] Instead, we demonstrate to peo-
ple whose grasp of the scientiﬁc method is weak that
we are mean-spirited human beings with little empathy
for their world view. As any religious proselytizer will
tell you, that is no way to win converts! We do diﬀer-
ent damage when we fail to speak up about how science
arrives at its conclusions.
Ultimately the problem returns to the way in which
we fail to educate our fellow citizens, from an early
age, about the methods of science (as opposed to “the
facts”). Young children are natural experimentalists –
a baby in a high chair who knocks her milk cup onto
the ﬂoor repeatedly and observes the consequences has
made an observation (I knocked the cup on the ﬂoor;
dad picked it up and reﬁlled it); develops a hypothe-
sis (knocking the cup on the ﬂoor makes dad pick it up
and reﬁll it); tests the hypothesis via repeated sampling
(and understands innately that larger samples are bet-
ter); modiﬁes the hypothesis when presented with new
data (mom does the same thing; my older sister laughs
when the cup hits the ﬂoor, ergo knocking the cup on
the ﬂoor makes adults pick it up and reﬁll it). We take
this natural scientiﬁc impulse and squeeze it out of most
people by the time they are 13. Studies in American
show that kids make very good progress in understand-
ing science up until about grade 4; by grade 8 they are
far behind.
So rather than debating whether we can safely ignore
the Catholic Church, or accept them but battle their
anti-scientiﬁc message, I think we need to shift this dis-
cussion to creating a public that can incorporate sci-
entiﬁc information into its world view as the result of
careful study, not “on faith”. Until most people recog-
nize the vast amount of critical analysis that goes into
the “Theory of Evolution” and are comfortable with the
methods we use to arrive at our conclusions, they have
no particular reason to “trust us” any more than they
trust Cardinal Schonbrunn. Instead of railing against
the anti-scientiﬁc, we need to take an active role in re-
inventing science education at all levels (which, in my
opinion, would ﬁrst involve getting away from manda-
tory standardized testing so that teachers can teach
method and inquiry rather than facts). If we on evoldir
are not contributing to solving the problem of a poorly-
educated public, then we are never going to make much
headway against authority ﬁgures like the Cardinal.

Austin Hughes has urged us to accept that religious
claims form a canon of ’ﬁrst philosophy’ that is self-
evidently distinct from ’natural science’. Accepting for
a moment that such a dichotomy somehow holds, i.e.
that there are indeed parallel and mutually independent
modes of inquiry about reality – one subject to testing,
and the other not – I can’t see how one would discrim-
inate among the inﬁnite claims that could be classiﬁed
as ’ﬁrst philosophy’ (solely by virtue of their lack of
empirical grounding). Perhaps Austin can explain on
what reasoned grounds he has chosen to accept certain
such claims (e.g. the existence of an all-knowing, undy-
ing, entirely invisible virgin-born male ape, of admit-
tedly unknown karyotype) but reject others (e.g. the
existence of invisible, massless, tea-drinking giant pink
elephants with i/2 toes on each of their pi/3 feet).
Moreover, given that the claims of ’ﬁrst philosophy’ are
apparently extraneous under Occam’s razor, how can
one reasonably defend the necessity of any such claim
as key to an accurate understanding of the world? By
Hughes’ own deﬁnition, ’ﬁrst philosophy’ appears to
comprise the set of all propositions whose truth ver-
sus falsehood lacks empirical consequence; to adopt any
such belief seems, to me, unparsimonious. I’m surprised
that so insightful and proliﬁc a scientist would view an
insistence on intellectual parsimony as an unfair ’prej-
udice’.

In some of the postings discussing the view of the
Catholic Church on evolution, it has been suggested
that we should consider what has caused so many peo-
ple to become religious. There are actually scientiﬁcstudies (in the context of social sciences) on the eﬀects
of religion. While these studies don’t deal at all with
Evolution or Creationism, I thought these studies might
be interesting to some, particularly as this discussion
seems to be extending beyond evolution vs creationism.
Here are some links.

I share Brian Charlesworth’s healthy skepticism about
religious beliefs. I also try to tackle problems based on
logic rather than preconceived beliefs ( of course, I do
not always succeed).
In the current debate about Intelligent Design, the
problem - in my view - is a political one rather than
a scientiﬁc one. For instance, the kinds of books that
do, or do not, appear on a school curriculum, will be
decided by local school boards, state legislatures and
courts of law. It will not be decided as the result of a
laboratory experiment, a ﬁeld collection trip and/or a
computer simulation. In other words, science has some-
thing to do with it - but not everything. Consequently,
we must try to think as politicians as well as scientists.
As a ﬁrst tiny step toward becoming more politically
aware, I used Google to ﬁnd the CIA “World Fact-
book” on the distribution of religious beliefs (the data
are listed below). According to the CIA, we - the scep-
tics - are outnumbered about seven to one worldwide.
What should we do based on these ﬁgures? One option
is to ﬂee from our labs and seek sanctuary in the closest
church, mosque, temple or synagogue (listed according
to their expected frequencies on the planet). A second,
more serious option is to maintain our intellectual posi-
tions and our views, while recognizing the magnitude of
the political challenge. A third option, which I do not
recommend, is to dismiss the religious majority. That
would simply be bad politics, as well as being not very
civil.
Is there anything practical that can be done, other than
waging a potentially futile war of words against the reli-
gious majority? A possible solution is provided by Alan
Leshner in his Science editorial entitled “Redeﬁning Sci-30 EvolDir August 1, 2005
ence” that appeared in the July 8 issue. His suggestion
that Intelligent Design could be taught in a compara-
tive religions course, but not in a biology course, seems
reasonable to me. It is, however, the kind of compro-
mise that would probably be rejected by many on both
sides of the debate.
In conclusion, I believe that we live in a world where
religious, cultural and artistic values have a huge inﬂu-
ence on our lives, including our scientiﬁc lives, despite
the fact that they are not based on any objective eval-
uation. Although these factors do not generally aﬀect
the outcomes of our experiments, they can inﬂuence
our choice of scientiﬁc problem - often through fund-
ing allocation decisions. As a scientist, I would ﬁnd a
world that contained less subjectivity to be much less
confusing and frustrating - but maybe less interesting
too!

One of the problems we are encountering here is that so
many scientists are unfamiliar with philosophy. “First
philosophy” or “metaphysics” is NOT equivalent to re-
ligion. It is perfectly possible to have a metaphysics
without any religion at all. After all, Aristotle, who was
not religious (at least in any sense we would recognize
today), is both the source of the term “metaphysics”
and of the distinction between metaphysics and natural
science that was later adopted by the Catholic Church.
It is perfectly possible for a nonbeliever to address ques-
tions of ﬁrst philosophy or metaphysics. First philos-
ophy deals with questions such as how we are able to
know the truth about anything. Have you ever seen a
convincing scientiﬁc explanation of why science works?
Of course not. One has to go outside of science to deal
with the concepts (evidence, reason, truth) on which
science depends. First philosophy – whether practiced
by a believer, an agnostic, or an atheist – uses a dif-ferent mode of reasoning than that of natural science.
It is based on reason and argumentation, not on ex-
periment or observation. Yet science depends on ideas
from ﬁrst philosphy, whether scientists are aware of it
or not. Most scientists and philosophers now accept,
following Popper, that an essential characteristic of sci-
entiﬁc hypotheses is that they are expressed in falsiﬁ-
able form. (Note that Popper had to step outside of
science to formulate and argue for that position.) Now
consider the statement: “No sentence can be simulta-
neously both true and false.” Is the latter statement
falsiﬁable? Of course not. Yet if we do not accept that
statement, we cannot do science. In fact, if we do not
accept that statement we cannot even live our day-to-
day lives. A statement such as, “There is an intelligent
being that designed the universe” also potentially be-
longs to the realm of ﬁrst philosophy. Note that my
saying that the statement belongs to the realm of ﬁrst
philosophy does not imply that the statement is true.
I also say “potentially” because religious believers may
treat such a statement as an article of faith. However,
philosophers are free to examine such a statement by
the light of reason alone. Like any other philosophi-
cal statement, it is subject to argument for or against.
This or similar statements have in fact been proposed
and argued about for centuries by philosophers, not all
of whom were in any way religious. It is true that cer-
tain philosophical statements, like the above example,
will always be subject to debate. Yet there are other
statements of ﬁrst philosophy that some have ventured
to describe as “self-evident.” For example, when Jef-
ferson et at. (1776) declared certain propositions re-
garding human rights to be “self-evident,” they did not
view those as religious statements (despite reference to
a Creator) and still less as statements of natural sci-
ence. Rather, they viewed them as basic philosophical
principles. The human rights whose existence Jeﬀerson
claimed to be “self-evident” are not material objects
and cannot be empirically measured in any way. No
falsiﬁable hypothesis regarding the existence of human
rights could ever be devised. Yet I for one would not
trust very far any person who does not accept their ex-
istence, or indeed anyone who does not consider their
existence to be “self-evident.” In dealing with a person
in society, it doesn’t matter so much to me so much
whether they go along with Jeﬀerson when it comes to
the “Creator” part – that’s their own business – but
I’d be very wary of anyone who denies the the rest of
Jeﬀerson’s “propositions.” However, those propositions
belong to metaphysics, not to natural science. A rig-
orously “materialist” position (such as several recent
postings have recommended) would lead one to deny
that there is such a thing as a natural human right. In
fact, the ideologies of Communism and Fascism wereAugust 1, 2005 EvolDir 31
consistently materialist in denying the existence of hu-
man rights – and in acting accordingly. Which should
remind us that we have at least as much (if not more) to
fear from consistent materialists as we do from religious
fanatics. I think it is important to remember the dis-
tinction between metaphysics and natural science be-
cause it provides the perfect answer to ID: The idea of
“intelligent design” is a very interesting idea, one can
say, but it belongs to metaphysics not to natural sci-
ence. Therefore, a biology class is not the appropriate
place to discuss such an idea. End of argument.

Austin,
I do not accept Intelligent Design. And I agree that
it has some falsiﬁcation issues. For clariﬁcation, I am
a nonreligious well-trained Darwinian evutionary biol-
ogist with a PhD in evolutionary genetics nad plenty of
natural history and ecological insight.
Nonetheless, I think Intelligent Design is, in principle,
a scientiﬁc claim. It is a claim which is eroded every
time scientists ﬁnd more detailed explanations for evo-
lutionary history.
Most philosophers of science are not dogmatic Poppe-
rians. Nor are scientists in practice. The possibility
of falsiﬁcation is not the only criterion for a scientiﬁc
theory. I tend to follow Lakatos – research programs
die out if they don’t make progress, and this process
is, and probably should be, the main way science pro-
ceeds. Few scientists are Intelligent design researchers,
because the more materialistic approaches continue to
work. And because ID research has provided little illu-
mination or new insights into the history or mechanisms
of evolution.
I tell my students that if scientists had never found any
“missing links” between chimps and humans, that sci-
entists would now doubt Darwin’s theory about human
evolution. But we have found a dozen missing links
and thousands of relevant fossils. If scientists had never
found evidence that organic molecules could abiotically
form, then we might well believe the origin of life needed
Divine inspiration (as Darwin sometimes supposed or
at least conceded in the ﬁnal sentence of the Origin).And, if we never ﬁnd natural circumstances in which
RNA molecules can spontaneously, abiotically, form,
then scientists will begin to wonder the same thing.
But in the 150 years since Darwin published his theory,
lots of gaps have been ﬁlled. Progress does not seem
anywhere close to an end. Meanwhile Intelligent Design
has made very little progress in the past few thousand
years. Both are legitimate scientiﬁc theories. One isn’t
going anywhere.

When did evoldir become alt.agnostic?
Several posters are advocating ﬁghting ID by arguing
that we should advance an athistic alternative. This
strikes me as na¨ ıve politically (we will loose a lot of
allies from more mainstream religions). It also seems
rather arrogant to insist that anyone who accepts evo-
lution has to accept the rest of the athiest world view
(which is just as much a matter of faith as religion: can
you prove the non-existance of God, without the aid of
a Babel ﬁsh?).
People are able to square their theological and scientiﬁc
beliefs. If our aim is to tackle ID (an attack on a scien-
tiﬁc idea), why shouldn’t we respect people’s theologi-
cal views? Of course, if the real aim is to advance the
athiest agenda, using evolution as the battle ground,
then at least be honest about it.

I try to answer to Brian Charlesworths message, whose
basic views are not too diﬀerent from mine, reminding
all of us that the attempt to understand nature and its
laws is only part of the task of us scientists. Another
important part of our work is to share our knowledge
with the community we are in, and it is here that the
views expressed by cardinal Sch¨ onborn in his New York
Times article are relevant to us. I cannot check the ci-
tation at the moment, but I remember Darwin asking
in one of his letters (possibly to Hooker) whether a
conclusion that is true at the 100 per cent level, but
remains the privilege of a small minority, is better than
a conclusion that is only 80 per cent true, if the latter
is accepted by the majority of people.
Scientists have a social responsibility, and we must not
forget it. Although my knee-jerk reaction would have
been to propose a distinguished evolutionist, possibly
Charlesworth himself, to submit a paper on theology to
the New York Times, that would have been a bad idea,
I think. I ﬁnd it particularly futile to discuss whether
science is better or worse than religion. They are dis-
tinct human activities, such as art and science. Much
like a geneticists opinion on cubism is of no special in-
terest for art historians, Sch¨ onborns views oﬀend, in the
ﬁrst place, the Catholics who, above and beyond their
metaphysical beliefs (about which science has nothing
to say, because science only deals with the physical
world) are interested in a rational interpretation of nat-
ural phenomena. I also think that a member of the
Catholic hierarchy has no right to call neo-Darwinism
a dogma, when all of Darwins work shows a strenuous
eﬀort to submit any conclusions, including his own, to
scrupulous critical evaluation. Finally, I think that, al-
though it would be simpler (and more pleasant) to lock
ourselves in our laboratories and keep working on the
subjects we like most, ever since Darwin the study of
evolution has had undeniable political reﬂexes and im-
plications, and particularly so in this unfortunate mo-
ment of the worlds aﬀairs. I have no simple solutions
to propose, but I think that we cannot and should not
keep our mouths shut. Even for people like me who
call themselves atheists, it is crucially important that
people who call themselves Christian be free to pursue
their interest in evolution, if they feel that there is no
logical contradiction between their scientiﬁc views andtheir religious ideas.

On Religon and Biology We like to quote Dobzhansky
that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light
of evolution, but that is of course a non-sense state-
ment. A lot made sense in biology before Darwin, and
many or even most life scientists today do not use evo-
lution in their daily work. So it is easy for critics to
point out things that do make ’sense’ usnig views other
than evolution. A lot of systematics can be done that
way, as can a lot of biochemistry, human biomedical
genetics, and agricultural breeding to name but a few
areas. Many human geneticists I know speciﬁcally say
that evolution is not relevant–not for religious reasons
but because they don’t want to have to take it into
account, or see whey they need to do so, in trying to
ﬁnd the cause of disease. Of course, the facts in life
science are all *consistent *with evolution, and make
*more *sense, and that is why ’evolution’ is such a uni-
fying concept. But, in regard to schools and religious
statements such as by the Catholic Church....just what
do they mean by ’evolution’? If that everything is due
to natural selection, then this is patently wrong, un-
less you entirely deny a role for drift, for example. If
’evolution’ means that life is the result of an historical
process from one common origin here on earth, that
is partly correct–only partly because (for example) if
panspermia or Mars-life were true, we would still hold
evolutionary views. Horizontal transfer could (in prin-
ciple) mean that life had multiple origins–indeed, how
likely is it that only *one *set of molecules in one tiny
sulphurous pond in the entire earth did ’life’ processes
occur? Or in the school debate do we mean that sci-
ence is about what we can study and organize about life
in terms of those things that can be observed, tested,
measured, and the like–and that our current best ex-
planation is ’evolution’? Just what is it that we wish to
be taught in schools that is not its own kind of dogma
(even if it is materially true, or more so than a reli-
gious dogma)? If we were ourselves a bit clearer about
the subtleties of the concepts that we want in science,
things might go a bit more smoothly. When the Church
says ’evolution’ is or isn’t true, what do they mean?August 1, 2005 EvolDir 33
Common origin through historical processes instigated
by God? That’s very diﬀerent than what Darwin had in
mind. His was the Hobbesian view, that we are *by na-
ture *the result of competition, inequity, ruthlessness,
etc. because it is through Malthusian processes that
we were formed by history. That means that ’original
sin’ was really *origin *sin, because we had our ill na-
ture before anybody bit any apples, not afterwards. I
hardly think the Church means that when they sup-
port, as they did in the previous Pope’s tenure, the
consistency of the Darwinian theory of evolution with
Church teachings. Like most things, much of the de-
bate is about semantics, used by contending groups in
defense of competing world views that, in turn, almost
always are rallying symbols around other things like
control of political power and resources, feeings of se-
curity, and so on. That is certainly the case here. Ken

Indeed. I would further specify that these principles
are merely social norms that emerged during culturalevolution. I don’t know whether Jeﬀerson would agree
with me, but my argument is that these principles come
and go through the process of cultural evolution. As
dearly as I hold these principles myself, they did not
exist in a cultural vacuum waiting to be discovered.
Jeﬀerson and his colleagues made them up, inspired by
the Greeks and other predecessors.

Indeed. They do not exist except as symbolic (to us)
templates (neural, spoken, written, etc.).

I would not want to change these societal norms ei-
ther, but that does not mean that they exist outside of
the symbols or evolved (and evolving) structure of our
society. As far as being “self-evident”, that certainly
depends on the social context and experience of the ob-
server. I’m glad they were “self-evident” to Jeﬀerson,
and the feel that way to me, but I think there is no basis
for claiming that they are universally “self-evident.”
>However, those propositions belong to metaphysics,
not to >natural science.
This is the sticking point for me. I know there is a long
tradition of thinking and writing about metaphysics in
both religion and philosophy in which the word “meta-
physics” has taken on particular meanings. If I take
the word to mean what it suggests on the surface, phe-
nomena outside the realm of the material universe, then
my stance is that there is simply no such thing as meta-
physics at all. I am glad to live in a society where people
are free to believe otherwise, but I think the “material-
only” perspective is badly muddied by failing to point
out that there is neither evidence of nor a logical need
to invoke the existence of anything metaphysical in try-
ing to understand any phenomenon. In this sense, the
propositions you referred to are not metaphysical at all.
They exist as physical structures in the neural networks
that manifest our minds and in the symbolic structures
we use for communication.

I obviously disagree. All ideologies are the product of
cultural evolution. In that sense Communism, Fas-
cism and Democracy are only qualitatively diﬀerent
outcomes of this process. On what basis do you claim
that “natural human rights” exist beyond the cultural
norms that evolve? Rights are granted. They do not
exist in a cultural vacuum.
You could be correct that the national adoption of a
purely materialist perspective could lead to less sym-
pathetic forms of government like Communism or Fas-
cism, but I doubt it. It certainly would not be in-
evitable. The historical governments you have in mind
did not come into being because the population became
materialistic, rather they tried to impose that perspec-
tive after taking power.

Aloha,
I very much appreciate Gail’s thoughtful appraisal of
faith and how we (science geeks) too request it of those
not so intimate with our studies.
I would like, in the interests of precision and accuracy,
to point out that many of us appear to be using the
word “reigion” when what we mean is Judeo-Christian
religions as faith reliant docterines. Allow me please
to quote His Holiness The Dalai Lama (the leader of
Tibetan Buddhism) with respect to the need for reason
in Buddhist practice (please read the book for more
complete contextualization):... Consequently, I believe it is very important for Bud-
dhist scholars and thinkers to become better acquainted
with [science]For example, scientiﬁc investigation of the
existence of a particular subject may reveal a multitude
of logical fallacies. If we then persisted in accepting
its existence, it would contradict reason. If it can be
clearly proved that something that should be ﬁndable
if it exists cannot be found under investigation, then
from a Buddhist point of view we accept that it does
not exist. If this somehow contradicts some aspect of
Buddhist doctrine as contained in the scriptures, we
have no other choice but to accept that the teaching
is in need of interpretation. Thus, we cannot accept a
teaching literally simply because it has been taught by
the Buddha: we have to examine whether it is contra-
dicted by reason or not. If it does not stand up to rea-

Dear Members,
I have followed with great interest on this debate of re-
ligion versus evolution. I feel that one factor remain
uncommented on is the psychological aspect of the re-
ligion and science.
According to the father of modern psychology Carl
Jung, religious concepts such as God or a Creator are
’archetypes’ embedded in our common unconscious. In
another words, such concepts are universal (and inher-
ited) across diﬀerent races, cultures, and even tran-
scends time. Such archetypical images are best illus-
trated in myths and folklore. For example, in many
cultures there are a universal description and certain
degree of acceptance in concepts such as ghosts, spirits,August 1, 2005 EvolDir 35
souls, and gods.
Jung believes that these archetypes are embedded in
our shared unconscious and hence we all ’feel’ and ac-
cept these concepts to a certain degree.
I feel that science itself is also an embedded archetype.
our continuous eﬀorts to understand, explore, and ra-
tionalize is also universal.
So I don’t think we are looking at the whole picture
yet. I think once we have taken into consideration all
of the informations available to us, then could we begin
to settle this debate. Otherwise, we’ll just be keep on
going around in circles.
All the best wishes,
(Layperson on both subjects)

Guy Hoelzer has already eloquently rebutted Austin
Hughes’ red herring/argument-by-consensus about the
concept of ’rights’. I would like to address two other
key arguments that Hughes has put forth:
>Most scientists and philosophers now accept, follow-
ing Popper, >that an essential characteristic of scien-
tiﬁc hypotheses is that they >are expressed in falsiﬁ-
able form. (Note that Popper had to step >outside of
science to formulate and argue for that position.) Now
>consider the statement: “No sentence can be simulta-
neously both true >and false.” Is the latter statement
falsiﬁable? Of course not. Yet >if we do not accept
that statement, we cannot do science. In fact, if >we
do not accept that statement we cannot even live our
day-to-day >lives.
First, the statement in question -is- falsiﬁable. All one
needs to do to falsify it is to ﬁnd a sentence that is
simultaneously both true and false. Cheekily, I nom-
inate ’I am Spartacus’ as just such a sentence. Less
cheekily, one might nominate ’This sentence is false.’ If
you reject both of these nominees, there are an inﬁnite
number of other sentences to check, so get cracking.
Maybe Hughes was trying to fashion a conundrum (such
as ’this sentence is false’) in order to highlight a sup-posed distinction between logical reasoning and empir-
ical falsiﬁability. Let’s go ahead and grant him such a
distinction – or at least grant that G¨ odel’s Incomplete-
ness theorem suggests that it is ultimately impossible
to prove anything absolutely. But even granting that,
Hughes’ next claim:
>A statement such as, “There is an intelligent being
that>designed the universe” also potentially belongs
to the realm of ﬁrst >philosophy.
simply does not follow (unless we give the term ’poten-
tially’ a loose interpretation). The claim in question
diﬀers qualitatively from a logical conundrum such as
’This sentence is false’. Unlike the latter, the ’intel-
ligent designer’ claim is entirely empirical. Meaning
that if the claim were true, the world would be empir-
ically diﬀerent (i.e., it would have an additional real
being in it) than it would be if the claim were false.
Our diﬃculty in falsifying the claim is not due to some
epistemological shortcoming of logic, but simply to our
ﬁnite resources in searching every cranny of the world
for such a material being.
Finally, on to ID (where it seems like a lot of these posts
end up heading toward):
>I think it is important to remember the distinction
between >metaphysics and natural science because it
provides the perfect answer >to ID: The idea of “intel-
ligent design” is a very interesting idea, >one can say,
but it belongs to metaphysics not to natural science. >
Therefore, a biology class is not the appropriate place
to discuss >such an idea. End of argument.
The end of argument comes much earlier for ID. Its core
claim -is- falsiﬁable (on solely logical terms, too). That
claim is:
The world is too complex to have manifested by chance;
therefore, it must have been designed by an inherently
more complex being.
This is laughable reasoning. All the hullaballoo about
which course it belongs in, whether or not we should
politically appease its proponents, &c. misses the glar-
ingly obvious ﬂaw that the ’intelligent designer’ can-
not, under ID’s own assumptions, have manifested by
chance, but must itself have been designed by a yet
more complex, more intelligent designer, &c. And on
and on, ad nauseam. Apparently, it’s turtles all the
way down...
Folks, we need to be out there publicly debunking this
stuﬀ, not sitting back on our heels apologizing for sci-
ence encroaching on ancient-but-well-funded bs.

A person that accepts the common origin of life in
this planet, yet refuses to accept the biological-social-
historical explanation of religion strikes me as a curios-
ity. Religion owes its existence to same roots and forces
as love for the partner, parernal love and respect for fel-
low man. Like love and zealousness for the partner is
exercised in the name of honor, a human-made concept,
so is religion exercised in the name of god, an equally
human-made concept. Together with honor and ethos,
religion may have been necessary for the working of
human societies, but like honor and ethos it may lead
to crime (think of the analogy between vendetta and
honor and genocide and religion).
Rather than philosophizing about metaphysics, we bet-
ter devote our energies into making the sociobiological
nature of religion (and of the concept of god) more and
more abundantly clear and accepted. Very few of us
understand the theory of aerodynamics, but all sign
our acceptance of it any time we step in a plane. It is
not a matter of faith in the theory. Rather, it is the
assurance that if it worked several million times before
it will work again. It is the force of the repeated oc-
currence that replaces mysticism with pragmatism in
every day life. No more people today understand ev-
erything about medicine in the village I was born, and
no fewer believe in god than in my grandfather’s gen-
eration. Yet practically nobody will call the priest to
chase away the bad spirit when he/she falls ill, as was
the overwhelming practice in my grandfather’s gener-
ation. When we have more tangible and compelling
evidence for the sociobiological nature of religion (from
the molecular and cellular basis of such things as fear,
love and hope) the shifting form religious appeals to
realism will be as inevitable as was the replacement of
the priest by the physician in my village.
But do not expect the need to appeal to something spir-
itual to disappear, for the same reason we do not expect
that the full sociobiological explanation of parental love
will cause its dissipation. People will continue to kneel
in worship of a concept that they fully realize it is of
their own creation. Evolution can be as obvious and
as unshakably proven as the Earth’s orbit around the
sun, but the voices for intelligent design will remain.Irrational but explainable.

Let me propose something practical on this theme. In
1966, the Wistar Institute of Anatomy & Physiology
in Philadelphia held a symposium entitled “Mathemat-
ical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation
of Evolution”. This symposium was attended by a
small group of scientists, including evolutionary biol-
ogists whose names will be familiar (Mayr, Medawar,
Waddington, Wright, Lewontin), as well as several oth-
ers that we would call “computer scientists” today. The
latter had tried to use evolution-inspired methods to
solve complex optimization problems, and they found
that this approach failed. This led them to the conclu-
sion that random mutation and selection did not con-
stitute a suﬃcient theory to account for evolution, and
that some other principles were needed. Several of them
developed mathematical arguments for the improbabil-
ity of certain biological outcomes.
The important thing to note is that the organizers of
the conference brought together these two groups for
the speciﬁc purpose of discussing challenges to the pre-
vailing view, challenges that were judged creditable and
that were brought forth by scientists.
The symposium volume, dated 1967, is very interesting
reading. It is at this symposium, during a transcribed
discussion included in the volume, where Medawar says
“The whole real guts of evolution– which is, how do you
come to have horses and tigers, and things– is outside
the mathematical theory. So when people say that aAugust 1, 2005 EvolDir 37
thing is vacuous, I think they may be thinking of this
part of it.” I had seen this quote before, but it was
always truncated after “horses and tigers and things”.
More to the point, the Wistar Symposium, 1967, seems
to be required reading for advocates of intelligent de-
sign. If you poke around on the internet you will ﬁnd
that ID advocates are still drawing arguments straight
out of this symposium volume.
Now, please, I do not want to be ﬂooded with emails
from people who haven’t actually read the Wistar
volume and don’t actually know anything, but wish
to assure me that these and other criticisms of neo-
Darwinism have no substance and were rebutted long
ago. Save yourself the trouble– I have no need of further
evidence of the “circle-the-wagons” mentality.
However, if any of you are interested in responding to
the Wistar volume, or if you know of a scientiﬁc pa-
per or book that responds to it, please contact me with
speciﬁc information, and maybe I can start to assem-
ble some kind of resource relevant to this. At the very
least, I will summarize any substantive responses and
post the results back to evoldir.

Dear Colleagues,
The message of Brian Charlesworth refers to the old
question of material versus immaterial world. In a
physic world the miracles described in the Bible and the
New Testament, and in the books of other religions, lack
any empirical support and can not be veriﬁed by ex-
periments. But are material objects the only real thing
existing in our world? The position of Charlesworth
deserves all my respect, as I believe that God created
us free to think and to choose. However, I do not see
in his statements the same kind of respect for those
who believe in things that can only be seen with eyes
of the faith. The attempt to make the religious mes-
sages to appear as merely and stupid things, and to
call ridiculous the people having religious beliefs, is to
me the same lack of tolerance that in (fortunately over-
come) past times other fundamentalists people appliedto non-believers, even bringing them into ﬁre.

Guido Barbujani mirrors my own thoughts. Informed
commentary on evolutionary theory or any other sub-
ject, from any source, should be welcome (my ﬁrst de-
partment Head was a music critic for the local paper).
Conrariwise, the musings of a (so far as I know) scien-
tiﬁcally uninformed Catholic apparatchik on a scientiﬁc
matter are of no relevance. We should recall Professor
Huxley’s response to Bishop Wilberforce. The matter is
relevant only in a socio-political context, in which in my
own country the so-called “Christian” Right seems to
be ﬁnding strange bedfellows among newly-conservative
Catholic theologians. They’re welcome to each other; I
aﬃrm my preference for the ape, or at least the mito-
chondrial Eve.

Dear Friends,I wonder if I am the only one who is
impressed by weakness of the objections to Brian
Charlesworth’s query. The claim that science and re-
ligion are compatible with each other seems largely to
have reduced to idea that religion deals in matters that
are ultimately unknowable and so cannot be touched
by science. This would be fair enough, I suppose, if
the intention were to show that religion is of no inter-38 EvolDir August 1, 2005
est whatsoever to scientiﬁcally-minded people, but in-
steadit is somehowregarded as legitimizing religion as
part of a scientist’s worldview. This is what I regard
as remarkable.In my youth, while I was still religious
(disclosure: Society of Friends, or Quakers, ofwhich I
retain a large ethnic imprint), I regarded the existence
and nature of God as quite open to empirical investiga-
tion and wondered why no one seemed to be doing just
that. We now see why.
To those who continue to maintain that religion and
science are compatible, I always say ﬂatly No, they are
not. And the reason has nothing to do with the evi-
dence. Religion is based on faith. Science is based on
doubt. One cannot have both without admitting to a
sort of schizophrenia, with some rather heavy costs.

There is also a purely pragmatic issue at stake here.
Regardless of what we may think about religious faith,
it is not only here to stay but it is clearly gaining po-
litical power and an increasingly central place in pub-
lic life, at least in the United States. There is litle
reason to expect that this will change any time soon.
Thus, like it or not, we have to deal with the fact that
most Americans, and their elected leaders who plot re-
search and education budgets and policy, are “people of
faith”. Responding to creationist challenges, ridiculous
as they may be, by insulting religious people in general
is shooting ourselves in the foot. This will just support
the creationist caricature of scientists as elitist atheists
(communists, etc.) who are out of touch with normal
people.
There can obviously be no compromise on the objec-
tivity and evidentiary basis of scientiﬁc knowledge, and
we are all obligated personally as scientists to uphold
those standards and communicate them eﬀectively to
the general public. Nevertheless, we can neither ignore
religion nor dismiss it. If rigorous, objective science
is to survive and thrive, we will have to ﬁnd commonground and ways to engage creatively and productively
with the open-minded but quiet majority of religious
people.

After reading several messages that try, to varying de-
grees, to reconcile empirical and magical thinking, I feel
it’s time for more of us (scientists) step forward to pub-
licly echo and defend Brian Charlesworth’s views on the
latter. Brian rightly expressed incredulous dismay that
core claims of some long-outmoded ancient cosmologies
(from southwest Asia, in particular) continue to hold
sway in our society, and continue to demand our nomi-
nal ’respect’, as Jose Serrano put it, if not our outright
adherence.
As I see it, an adult who claimed that Santa Claus or a
ﬂoating pink elephant actually existed and was watch-
ing over them would be widely scoﬀed at, if not deemed
insane. Yet somehow the belief that a parthenogenet-
ically born, invisible, all-knowing sky-man who died
2000 years ago is watching over one is considered a
tenet of ’faith’ not to be publicly ridiculed or subjected
to the same sort of scrutiny deserved by any earnest
claim about reality.
As evolutionists, we might spend a bit more time
and eﬀort considering how the capacities for spreading
and adopting such empirically groundless beliefs have
evolved in humans – i.e. how such beliefs may serve the
interests of particular individuals in a hierarchical pri-
mate social structure, how they may function to distort
and exploit the perception of kin relations (one thinks
of the rife kinship terms in many religious contexts, for
example) – and less time and eﬀort appeasing institu-
tions that feel so threatened by the potential demise of
such beliefs.
Despite widespread protestations to the contrary, mod-
ern cosmology (and its implied sub-ﬁelds, such as biol-
ogy) -is- in direct and inescapable conﬂict with many
fossilized claims derived from older cosmologies. Think
of the struggles of Galileo and Huxley – but think also
of Kennewick Man; of the current strife over astron-
omy at Kitt Peak in Arizona; of reproductive luddites
who invoke mealy concepts like ’the sanctity of [speciﬁ-August 1, 2005 EvolDir 39
cally human] life; and of the Catholic church’s tortuous
dissembling on evolution.
Scientists have no duty to graciously duck such con-
ﬂicts, or to help society sweep them under a rug of ’tol-
erance’ – rather, we ought to be forcefully pointing out
the ways in which human insight has advanced, and the
ways in which longterm societal interests may be best
served by adopting new insight, rather than clinging
to patently silly ideas. Ideological relativism – ’your
ideas are inherently ﬁne, and mine are inherently ﬁne’
– is simply inconsistent with the public responsibility
of every scientist.

Greetings,
I, for one, applaud Dr. Charlesworth’s forthright state-
ment. Not only do I agree with his position, but I think
it expresses respect for others in its clarity and honesty.
We do not do society a favor by blurring our position
with politically correct language. Intolerance and dis-
agreement are diﬀerent things.
I also think that this is a critical time for the material-
only viewpoint, which I see as fundamental to all sci-
ence, to be clearly articulated to the general public. I
know that there are many scientists who have faith in
the existence of immaterial things and I do not want to
debate that issue here. My point is that the material-
only view needs to be made clear as a plausible the-
ory to all. In my opinion, devotion to mythologies has
often led humans to counter- productive and even de-
structive behavior. Further, religion is currently fueling
a dangerous global situation, or it is being used as a foil
to the same end. Either way, awareness of a plausible
material-only perspective should have a calming inﬂu-
ence over a smoldering situation.

Dear Colleagues:
I have read with interest the recent comments on evo-
lution and Catholicism. I am myself an evolutionary
biologist and a practicing Catholic, something I have
never seen to be contradictory, based on the authorita-
tive teaching of the Church since Pope Pius XII and a
philosophical tradition that goes back many centuries.
It is sometimes said that anti-Catholicism is the last so-
cially acceptable prejudice, and unfortunately we have
seen some evidence of the truth of this statement in
recent postings.
In my opinion, the creationists (both the crude “young
earth” creationists and the slicker ID types) make a
fundamental philosophical error: a confusion between
natural science and ﬁrst philosophy (or metaphysics).
The distinction between natural science and ﬁrst philos-
ophy goes back in the Catholic tradition to at least St.
Augustine and Boethius, and it was a key idea in the
philosophical system of St. Thomas Aquinas. The con-
cept of a Creator (or even of an “intelligent designer”)
is an idea of ﬁrst philosophy and thus is outside the
realm of natural science.
It is important, however, that evolutionary biologists
not make the same philosophical error. Some evolu-
tionists may dismiss ﬁrst philosophy altogether (as do
logical positivist philosophers such as Quine), but even
a belief in the absence of any metaphysical reality is a
statement within the realm of metaphysics, not a state-
ment of natural science. Natural science in and of itself
can no more disprove the existence of any metaphysical
reality than it can prove its existence.
In Pope John Paul II’s famous 1996 letter (of which
Cardinal Schoenborn seemed so dismissive), he warned
Catholics against a philosophy of “evolutionism,” which
uses the fact of biological evolution as an unwarranted
basis for creating a materialistic ﬁrst philosophy. If
one gets past the pugnacious tone of Cardinal Scoen-
born’s letter, one can see that he is really saying the
same thing. Rather bizarrely, Cardinal Schoenborn
has given the name “Neo-Darwinism” to the materi-
alist philosophy he is opposing. This is very confusing
for biologists, since we are accustomed to use the term
“Neo-Darwinism” to designate the synthetic evolution-
ary theory that forms the theoretical basis of modern40 EvolDir August 1, 2005
biology. The cardinal is using this term in a very dif-
ferent sense, and I’m not sure what is the origin of this
eccentric usage. It is also worth noting that the opin-
ions expressed by Cardinal Schoenborn are his own; he
has no status to speak in the name of the universal
Church.
However, we all should be able to share Cardinal
Schoenborn’s concern for the erosion of reason in recent
years. Philosophical error is rampant on both sides of
recent debates about evolution, as indeed in some of
the other heated debates that characterize our society
at the present time.
Austin Hughes
“Austin L. Hughes” <austin@biol.sc.edu >
Evolutionist position on religion 17
The exchange of opinion after Cardinal Schoenborn’s
op-ed shows by itself that it is an empirical fact that
evolutionary biologists can combine evolutionary biol-
ogy as a science and religion. Moreover, this is well
known: remember Dobzhansky, David Lack, Simon
Conway Morris among others, and two scientists both
called Miller (paleontology an biochemistry) who have
done good work in the US denouncing ID. Combining
religion and science it therefore shown to be possible
- the sort of fact that cannot be denied by anyone’s
private opinion.
The position that science by itself leads to atheism as a
world view is the main contention and overriding moti-
vation of the ID ideologues. If we espouse this view, we
grant ID its main point. After all, ID is not primarily
about science - it is part of a movement that sees the
world as sharply divided between atheists and Chris-
tians, and attacking evolution as if it equals atheism
is their public relations point. ID ’science’ is not that
important anyway; it has not advanced over the last 10
years, and science is not the main eﬀort of the Wedge
movement. The ID movement tries to force us into a
world that is sharply divided into two opposing camps,
not so much on science, but on the role of religion in
culture. I think the answer to ID is that they have the
relation between evolution and religion wrong to start
with, that the world is not as black / white as zelotes
see it.

God Love Religion Reason
Dear all,
I have read with interest the postings on evolution and
catholicism. I think we need to focuss the discussion.
Several writers have written about God and Love and
religion and reason. I thought you may like to hear
Gandhi who did a lot of thinking about some of these
things in his search for how to develop a peaceful soci-
ety:
“ My religion is based on truth and non-violence. Truth
is my God. Non-violence is the means of realising Him”
“ There should be truth in thought, truth in speech,and truth in action. To the man who has realised this
truth in perfection, nothing else remains to be known
because all knowledge is necessarily included in it.”
“ No religion which is narrow and which cannot satisfy
the test of reason, will survive the coming reconstruc-
tion of society in which the value will have changed and
character, not possession of wealth, title, or birth will
be the test of merit.”
Gandhi said that non-violence is not possible without
a living belief in God. I do not know if this statement
was his ﬁnal judgement about human nature regarding
the need of a God (regardless of the march of science
and arts in search of truth) or a true reﬂection of his
own belief in God. I belive it is the former as his state-
ment equating God with Truth would suggest that he
did not belive in God the way organized religions do.
One writer wrote that Love can not be measured. Sure
it can be - by counting absence of wars, blooddshed,
poverty and hatred!
I think the discussion should be steared away from
dwelling on past confrontation between science and
faith (religion) and towards what we can do, as sci-
entists and citizens, to convince people, slowly but
steadily, to restore religion to a “reason-based” enquiry
and dialogue about life and world.
I think who decides what should be taught in the
schools about the origins and diversity of life, and how
to convince religious leaders, around the world, that
“reason” is the most potent weapon against ignorance
and hatred - are the two most important points for sci-
entists to confront in this war.

LeontodonAsteraceae samples
We are seeking seeds from multiple species and popula-
tions of Leontodon for a survey of genome sizes in the
genus to ﬁnd a candidate for genome sequencing. Most
species in Asteraceae have rather large genomes that
make them poor candidates for sequencing. Leontodon
longirostris has the lowest recorded 2C-value in Aster-42 EvolDir August 1, 2005
aceae (2C = 0.8), putting it in the appropriate range for
sequencing. Only ﬁve species in the genus have records
in the Kew C-value database. We are surveying the
genus in order to identify candidates for sequencing.
If you have Leontodon seeds that you could send, or
have access to living material and would like to obtain
genome size estimates, please contact us.
Thanks,

III. The greatest diﬃculty in comprehend the message
of Love
Both the New and the Old Testaments used many para-
bles. A parable is a thought experiment (or gedanken-
experiment that had been used many times by Ernst
Mayer in his popular writings). Before I highlight the
greatest diﬃculty in comprehend the message of Love,
I wish to share with you a parable that is not from the
Bible, but from ancient Greek - Plato’s allegory of the
cave.
Imagine prisoners chained since childhood inside a cave,
with their heads immobilized in such a way that their
eyes are ﬁxed on a wall. Immediately behind the pris-
oners is a road along which men, animals and other
things travel. Behind the road is an enormous ﬁre that
projects the shadow of the travelers to the wall that the
prisoners are facing. Also, the voice of the travelers is
echoed from the wall in such a way that the prisoners
believe that the words come from the shadows. Gradu-
ally, the prisoners become quite good in identifying the
travelers by their shadows and voices that constitute
the “reality” in their minds.
Now suppose a prisoner is freed. Gradually he will com-
prehend a new reality. Once thus enlightened, he nat-
urally would want to return to the cave to convey the
new reality to his fellow prisoners. Unfortunately, once
back in the cave, he ﬁnds himself much less able to
identify the travelers by their shadows than his fellow
prisoners. Being thus perceived as inferior by his fel-
low prisoners, he fails completely in communicating the
new reality to his fellow prisoners who believe to knowbetter. The fellow prisoners are too arrogance to listen.
It is the arrogance in the mind of the prisoners that
prevents them from comprehending the new reality.
It is the arrogance in the mind of the ancient Jews that
prevented them from comprehending the word of Love.
Human arrogance is the greatest barrier standing be-
tween us and the word of Love. The Bible states that
all humans are sinners, that human arrogance is the
most fundamental sin, and that Satan is the embodi-
ment of arrogance. One might note that the Bible has
no record of Satan as a rapist or a maker and user of
WMD (Indeed, the easily identiﬁable mass-killer in the
Bible is not Satan but God himself). Satan is arro-
gance. Arrogance can do a great evil, and is the root
cause of all human conﬂicts.
God made two everlasting calls to human in the book
of Genesis. When Adam and Eve were persuaded to
believe that they knew better and ate the apple, God
was then unable to ﬁnd them where they should have
been, and He made the ﬁrst everlasting call to man:
“Where are you?”
When the arrogance in Cain’s mind persuaded him to
believe that he deserved better and drove him to kill
his brother Abel, God made the second everlasting call
to man: “Where is your brother Abel?”
“Where are you?”
“Where is your brother Abel?”
Where are we?
Where are our brothers and sisters?
Should we be so arrogant as to dismiss the questions
entirely? Surely they are not scientiﬁc questions, but
they are not intended to be scientiﬁc questions.
IV. Gedankenexperiment and reality: the separation of
the physical and the spiritual worlds
I wish to highlight one more point from Plato’s allegory
of the cave. We should not confuse a parable with phys-
ical reality. If, after hearing Plato’s allegory of the cave,
one insists in the existence of the cave and the group
of prisoners, and takes upon himself to ﬁnd the cave on
certain continent and the prisoners in certain history
books, then one surely has missed entirely the message
behind the parable. Yet many evolutionary biologists
(e.g., Prof. Brian Charlesworth) have demanded to see
such caves before they will pay attention to religion,
and many creation scientists have been determined to
produce such caves (and indeed have found many of
them).
The Bible is a giant parable to convey the message ofAugust 1, 2005 EvolDir 43
Love and eternity. There is no cave or prisoner to be
found.
I have previously mentioned the four major diﬃculties
in understanding Love, i.e., (1) Love is eternal, (2) Love
is incompatible with an arrogant mind, (3) Love is spir-
itual, and (4) our limited view of Love is often con-
founded by the evil which is called Satan in the Bible.
So far I have covered the ﬁrst three major diﬃculties.
The next section (i.e., section V) will cover the forth
diﬃculty, and section VI deals with something that few
of us would have expected, i.e., the extremely similarity
in the way of thinking between the Christian fundamen-
talists and the neo-Darwinian scientists.
Here are the section titles:
V. The fundamental diﬀerence between the forefathers
of USA and President Bush
VI. The similarity between Christian fundamentalists
and the evolutionary fundamentalists (the hardened
neo-Darwinians): the Panglossian paradigm in religion
and evolution

MSat dosage compensation
Dear EvolDir members, I’m working with polyploid an-
imals and I use some microsatellite primers that show
dosage eﬀect (most of them run on an ABI3100 system).
As longer fragments get ampliﬁed less than shorter
fragments, I have to compensate for these eﬀects, es-
pecially at short loci (meaning: a dosage proportion
of 2:1 means not the same for loci 79bp/86bp as for
79bp/104bp). I have calculated a compensation factor
that I can use, but are there any publications that deal
with the lesser ampliﬁcation of larger alleles? Maybe44 EvolDir August 1, 2005
somebody has even developed a formula for such cases?
I’d be happy for any suggestions... Cheers, -Christian

More on the Archbishop
With all respect due the Archbishop of Vienna (NY
Times July 7, 2005, “Finding Design in Nature”), I
object to his general thesis that “faith and reason” op-
pose “Neo-Darwinism and atheism”. Mixing up the
philosophy of atheism with the science of evolution is a
common mistake, an error that comes from both from
the anti-evolutionists and those who oppose traditional
religions. The Archbishop’s logical leap, that atheism
and “Darwinism” are one and the same, misses one
of the most important aspects of science. Science, in-
cluding evolution, is agnostic with reference to “ﬁnal
causes”. The scientiﬁc method can’t tell us whether (ornot) we are ultimately directed by some “higher” intel-
ligence. By studying evolution, scientists can’t know,
ultimately, whether order in nature provides evidence
for or against a designer, intelligent or otherwise. The-
ologians other than the Archbishop have been clear on
this distinction. In his search for prior texts about the
relationship between faith and science, the Archbishop
should have gone farther into the past, perhaps to St.
Augustine in the 4th century. Or he could have re-
turned just to 1852, when John Henry Newman wrote
“I believe in design because I believe in God, not in God
because I see design.” As for scientists, understand-
ing evolution may make them feel as fulﬁlled atheists,
but they too should realize that this feeling comes from
faith, not from science.

Move the discussion 2
I agree that it would be a good idea to create a dis-
cussion forum for this area of debate. I am forwarding
these emails to other scientists outside biology who are
interested in the evolution v creationist debate. I think
it would be good if other people outside biology could
sign onto the list to join in this debate group, who are
not necessarily interested in any of the other subjects
in the directory.
Alternatively, maybe you could set up a daily digest
containing all the emails on this subject, which is sent
out to people once daily. Then people can simply delete
it if they are not interested.

Can anybody help me with the implemenation of mod-
els in MrBayes?
I have a dataset of 18S ribosomal RNA for which I have
identiﬁed the stem and loop regions. I am implement-
ing a doublet model for the stem regions (partition 1).
Then I ran the loop regions (partition 2) through Mod-
eltest, resulting in TrN+I+G as the appropriate model.
According to this model, there are two distinct transi-
tion rates, but only one transversion rate. Is there any
way to implement this in MrBayes? As I understand it,
the lset settings for partition 2 would be: nucmodelKy4
Nst=3 rates=gamma But: the possible values for Nst
are restricted to 1, 2 or 6 And what about the invari-
able sites? If I cannot implement Nst=3, is it advisable
to go up to Nst = 6, resulting in a more complex GTR
model and probably longer computation times? Any
help is appreciated. Thanks, Anja

MultiplexPCR primer design
Hi all!
I am looking for a good program to design primers for
a multiplex- PCR to detect simultaneously several in-
del polymorphisms between two closely related species.
Ideally, from a set of sequences from both species, the
program should align sequences, ﬁnd indel polymor-
phisms and design the appropiate primers for these.
Any suggestions?
Thank you very much for your answers!!

NYT Op-Ed considered48 EvolDir August 1, 2005
This is just a short follow-up to the posting on Evoldir
of the 7 July 2005 NYT Op-Ed piece by Christoph
Sch¨ onborn. In that piece Cardinal Sch¨ onborn dis-
misses Pope John Paul’s 1996 statement (e.g. evo-
lution is “more than a hypothesis”) as “...vague and
unimportant...” An outsider might wonder, however, if
that view conﬂicts with the notion of papal infallibil-
ity which the Cardinal does support as “important and
valid” (Catholic News Service 1 April 2005). Infallibil-
ity is hard and cuts at least two ways.
On a related topic, to see an open letter concern-
ing science and religion which has been signed by
over 5000 Christian clergy urging “school board mem-
bers to preserve the integrity of the science cur-
riculum by aﬃrming the teaching of the theory of

PAM distance help
Hi all,
I am looking for a way to calculate distances between
pairs of protein sequeces. I need to implement the al-
gorithm inside my own program so I can’t use external
tools like phylip package. Currently I’m using PAM250
matrix to infer these distances, but I’m not sure if I am
doing it right because my resulting distances are very
diﬀerent than those obtained with protdist(phylip).
Should I use the odd matrix or the frecuency matrix?
By the way, can somebody give me an easy example
of how to calculate the distance for a simple pair of se-
quences obtaining a normalized distance between 0 and
1?
For example:
What would be the steps to calculate the distance (0..1)
between the following sequences using Pam250.
Seq 1: APTP Seq 2: APAA
ProtDist (phylip) returns this: —————————-
Seq1 Seq2 Seq1: 0.000000 0.571077 Seq2: 0.571077
0.000000 —————————–Perhaps this is silly, but I am really frustated because
i don’t get the same values !!!

Hi Daniela, I don’t know of any method that takes into
account allele size similarity, but I like the program
PARENTE, which does take into account error rates in
microsatellite typing. Hope that helps, Devon http:/-

Good morningTry PROBMAX by Roy Danzmann out
of the University of Guelph, Canadaor CERVUS is good
as well out of the University of Edinburgh, UKas well
see if you can get KINSHIP by Christophe Herbinger
out of Dalhousie University, Canada. KINSHIP works
well but last I heard wasn’t publicly available yet ...
maybe it is now? PeaceDarrin
Dear Daniela, I would recommend the software “Par-
ente” available at http://www2.ujf-grenoble.fr/leca/-
membres/manel.html I join here the computer note
which describes this program. You can allow a num-
ber of allelic incompatibilities in the parentage analysis,
to account for genotyping errors.Hope you will ﬁnd it
useful,Best Eva
Hi Daniela, I assume you mean taking allele size into
account only where there is a mismatch (i.e. in the
treatment of mutation/scoring error). If so I think that
the best publicly available package is probably Papa
(Duchesne et al. 2002. Molecular Ecology Notes, 2,
191-193). It should do what you want and has diﬀerent
options for how to treat error/mismatch. Of course us-
ing a model like that for errors assumes that the most
common type of problem is that you mis-score an allele
by one repeat unit. This may be the case e.g. if you are
using dinucleotides with a lot of stutter, but sometimes
the biggest source of scoring error might be diﬀerent
(e.g. allelic drop-out). Also, while mutation may fol-
low an SMM (or may not...) it’s very unlikely to be a
major contributor to false exclusions over a single gen-
eration. Alastair J Wilson PhDPostdoctoral Research

Dear Daniela, Currently, PaPa (Package for the Anal-

in consideration microsatellite size and typing errors by
the parameters e and S. You can download the pro-

Dear Daniela, Jones et Ardren (2003) published an in-
teresting paper about software that could be used in
case of parentage analysis.It will be a long story to de-
scribe all the methods, this paper summarizes it very
well.I’ve been using PAPA (package for the analysis of
parental allocation) for the parentage analysis. PAPA
performs parental allocation based on breeding like-
lihood methods, and comprises simulators that allow
statistical assessments of allocation accuracy (including
transmission error).Furthermore, this software is user-
friendly. Best wishes, nicolas Jones A.G., Ardren W.R.

Sciene,its limitations and evolution
Dear All,
As someone who believes that there is much more be-
tween heaven and earth than science can (yet?) ex-
plain, I look at the evolution versus intelligent design
discussion, and I can see why science seems to be at the
losing hand. And honestly, I am personally sometimes
appalled by how scientists claim their personal believes
as science.
For me, science and my spiritual believes are not mu-
tual exclusive. Science claims to work by the scien-
tiﬁc method, of observing, hypothesis building and (re-
peated) testing before one can establish truth in science.
And more precise, a test that fails to show the presence
of something, is no prove for the non-existence of that
same something, because one could be just looking at
the wrong place, in the wrong way or whatever. Sci-
ence is therefore inherently limited and the sole reason
we still have science is that we do not know everything
(yet). And when I look back at the past centuries of sci-
entiﬁc research, I see a way paved with discoveries once
deemed “impossible”, “non existing”, etc. It is the na-
ture of science to discover what we do not yet know.
And before the proof, we just do not know (yet).
If I talk about my spiritual believes with scientists, they
often claim that: “those things do not exist”. As long
as it is their own believe (aka “I do not believe those
things exist”), ﬁne. However, when they claim it is
proven by science, I ask for that prove, as I am curious
about that. However, I often get a long explanation
why they believe it does not exists, but until now, I
have not seen the scientiﬁc prove of the non-existence
of (for example) gods, spirits, etc.This inherent limitations of science, and the current
status of our proven knowledge, leaves a tremendous
space uncovered. There are however aspects of my life
that are important and are beyond what science can ex-
plain, and realizing the inherent limitations of science
makes it possible for me to integrate those two.
With evolution, I have the same problem. We have a
lot of evidence for the random version of evolution, and
we do not need the hand of an intelligent designer to
explain evolution. However, due to the inherent limi-
tations of science, we cannot prove a hand of an intel-
ligent designer has been absent completely. However,
this does not automatically prove the opposite either,
and I yet have to see even an decent indication that it
might be true, let alone solid scientiﬁc proof for intelli-
gent design, but until now, I have not heard anything
else than the perceived impossibility of science to ex-
plain certain aspects. And I challenge the ID-people to
come up with testable hypotheses that prove the exis-
tence of an intelligent designer as a better explanation
of the curent random-event driven version of evolution.
But until we have scientiﬁcally proven that intelligent
designers do not exist, some people will keep believing
in them.
At the moment, I see science losing the cultural war in
the US. And I honestly expect that the bud-heading be-
tween religious oriented intelligent designers (who have
not yet proven anything) and evolutionists (who have
not yet proven the non-existence of an intelligent de-
signer) will only increase in the near future. Until scien-
tists adopt a more inclusive stance that does not alien-
ate people of faith, I do not see much improvement. Ac-
knowledging the limitations of science, and the space it
leaves for people to believe beyond that point, is in my
opinion an important step towards a larger acceptance
of evolution by people.
Ok, this were my $0.02 in this discussion.

Scientiﬁc faith
Dear Friends,Dr Makarieva is quite mistaken to say that
one takes nothing on faith in science. There are ex-
actly three articles of faith at the heart of the natural
sciences:1. The universe exists. (If it does not, thenAugust 1, 2005 EvolDir 51
we are studying nothing.)2. It is lawful. (If it is not,
then we have no way to study it.) 3. These laws can be
known. (If they cannot, then our eﬀorts are in vain.)
In other words, natural scientists take the bare mini-
mum on faith, that which cannot be avoided. This is
why religion and science are absolutely incompatible.
The fact that there are some good scientists who are
at the same time religious does not in any way demon-
strate any compatibility between the two. (It is really
quite a foolish argument, one that we should all be em-
barrassed to see on this site.) It simply demonstrates
that humans are immensely ﬂexible, with a great ca-
pacity for holding two contradictory ideas at once.

SingleCopy gene
Hi all,
I am looking for a single-copy gene as an internal stan-

Maybe some one has an idea or ready to use degen-
erated primers ;-) .

Dear Evoldir members,
I got many useful responses for the question I posted
ﬁve days ago. Thank you to all who responded. One
paper was particularly useful:

gences in birds and the phylogenetic utility of hte nu-
clear RAG-1 gene. Molecular phylogenetics and Evolu-
tion 12(2): 115-123
Not sure about beta-actin (if there is a fragment con-
served enough but found only in single copy) and I did
not try with p53 yet. The responses are pasted below.

— Dear Iris,
I only have limited experience working on birds -
but wonder if the z/w linked sexing marker (chromo-
helicase-domain) would be useful? It is highly con-
served and much used - so you wouldn’t have to con-
vince a referee that it was single copy (although you
might need both z and w speciﬁc primers if dealing with
females - I don’t know how diﬀerent fragment lengths
work on real-time pcr.)
best wishes,
Sara
— Dear Iris, I would be very interested in seeing the an-
swer you’ll get on your question on a single copy gene to
be used as an internal standard in qPCR. To my knowl-
edge Primmer et al. published something on SNPs
identiﬁcation in birds using conserved primers...perhaps
this could be a good point to start with.
— Hi Iris- I know of several house keeping genes that
might be useful for your case. Personally, I am stan-
dardizing the real-time PCR with internal primers for
the gene P53, which is an oncogene involved in cell cy-
cle. What you can do is to download sequences in birds
for this gene from the NCBI web page and to design
primers in the most conserved region. Keep in mind
that the PCR product should not be longer than 150bp.
Sincerely, Ivan.
— I would recommend the RAG1 gene for this, but not
sure if it would work for RT-PCR (dont know enough
about RT). It is highly conserved in vertebrates, and
some pubs have actually been written using it for Aves.
I have used it for deeper level systematics in ﬁshes. If
you are interested, let me know, I have the references.

This (very new) venture was originally intended as a
simple news-bulletin-board of the endless worrying de-
velopments taking place in the USA. But if anyone
would like to continue the evoldir exchange, then they
would be welcome to do so: users simply need to gen-
erate a (free) login in order to post a message (and not
even that to read what others have posted!).
Of course there are many other, already established on-

perhaps the best known. What we can oﬀer at evolv-

scientists of evoldir can talk to one another in peace.

UCambridge DarwinProject
The complete work of Charles Darwin online
A major new project at the University of Cambridge
will create a comprehensive scholarly collection of
Charles Darwin’s published and unpublished writings,
except for correspondence, on the world wide web. The
project, designed and directed by Dr John van Wyhe
(University of Cambridge), is based at The Centre for
Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities
(CRASSH) at the University of Cambridge. A major
three year grant by the AHRC has been awarded to
Professor James Secord (Department of History and
Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge) and
Professor Janet Browne (Wellcome Trust Centre for
the History of Medicine, University College London)
to make the project possible The project aims to make
available online every book, article and signiﬁcant un-
published manuscript by Darwin, including associated
contemporary book reviews and related sources. The
letters are being published separately by the Darwin
Correspondence Project. New editorial introductions
and notes will accompany all the texts. Each page will
be available as digital text and photo image form. All
of the digitised texts will retain page or folio numbers54 EvolDir August 1, 2005
and full formatting such as italics. An innovative fea-
ture will be a complete bibliography and catalogue of
manuscripts. The site will be of invaluable use to stu-
dents and scholars in the ﬁelds of history, history of
science, literature, philosophy, the natural sciences and
lay readers throughout the world. It will have a pow-
erful custom-made search engine providing integrated
retrieval and display of material across the full range
of Darwin’s published works and manuscripts-in short
almost everything Darwin ever wrote. For further in-
formation see: http://darwin-online.org.uk – Dr John

phyloXML
ANNOUNCING PROPOSAL FOR phyloXML – AN
XML APPLICATION TO DESCRIBE PHYLOGE-
NIES
This is to announce our proposal for phyloXML.
Rationale:
There are diﬀerent formats to describe phylogenies.
Many of them have three drawbacks: 1. Speciﬁc to
a particular software. 2. Contain information about
how the phylogeny was created, but do not allow to an-
notate the phylogeny itself (except with branch lenghts
and names), especially with data from other domains.
3. Not extensible.
We suggest that an XML based format might reduce
some of these drawbacks.
Yet, since an XML format is only useful if it is widely
used and accepted by a large part the community, we
would like to present our unﬁnished proposal and get
as much input as possible. Also, we would like to in-
vite more collaborators (a SourceForge site has been
set up for for phyloXML, see: http://sourceforge.net/-
projects/phyloxml/ )
For our detailed proposal please see: http://-
www.phyloxml.org Thank you,

IchneumonoidWaspEvol
Postdoc:
A PDRA is sought for a 3 year, NERC-funded research
project to answer three fundamental questions about
the macroecology and macroevolution of ichneumonoid
wasps: Do generalist (idiobiont) and specialist (koino-56 EvolDir August 1, 2005
biont) species show the same tempo and mode of diver-
siﬁcation, or do specialists show higher turnover and
greater standing diversity as usually predicted? Are
latitudinal trends in diversity explicable by diﬀerences
in diversiﬁcation rates between temperate and tropical
lineages, or by diﬀerences in their ages? Have generalist
parasitoids dispersed among continents at higher rates
than specialists, as might be expected on the grounds
of host availability?
In order to answer these questions, we are seeking a per-
son to develop phylogenetic approaches to macroevolu-
tion that are useable with highly incomplete datasets.
Required skills: experience in computer programming
(ideally in R); statistical expertise; use of phyloge-

An NIH-funded postdoctoral position is available to
study the diverse microbial community that inhabits
the gastrointestinal tract, speciﬁcally that of humans
and mice. This community has important roles in host
physiology, is rich in ecological interactions, and has po-
tential for providing clues to the evolution of commen-
salism and pathogenicity. Some speciﬁc objectives of
the project include understanding the diversity within
the gut, the main diﬀerences between commensals and
their pathogenic relatives, and the paths of horizontalgene exchange within the gastrointestinal environment.
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to partic-
ipate in all aspects of the project, such as production
and screening of BAC libraries, and comparative se-
quence analyses of the obtained sequences. Applicants
should have skills in evolutionary genetics, genomics,
computational biology or microbiology. Programming
abilities a plus.
The person will be based in the Evolutionary Ge-
nomics Department of the DOE Joint Genome Insti-
tute ( http://www.jgi.doe.gov/programs/comparative/-
), but will also have the opportunity to interact with
the laboratory of Howard Ochman at the University
of Arizona at Tucson. The DOE Joint Genome Insti-
tute, established on January 1, 1997, is a consortium
of scientists, engineers and support staﬀ from the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence

Postdoctoral Position
Kin recognition and diﬀerential gene expression in Ara-
bidopsis thaliana
Competition for resources lowers growth and ﬁtness in
most organisms. Studies in animals have revealed that
relatedness between potential competitors is a key fac-
tor aﬀecting the intensity of competitive interactions.
As predicted by kin selection theory many animals canAugust 1, 2005 EvolDir 57
discriminate among related (kin) and unrelated (non-
kin) individuals and they are less competitive toward
kin. Accordingly, productivity is frequently higher in
groups of kin compared to groups of unrelated indi-
viduals. In plants, individuals of varying relatedness
compete with one another, so kin selection is also likely
to be important. Recent reports suggest the existence
of self/non-self recognition in roots. At the molecular
level, however, nothing is known about how such com-
munication is established.
As part of an interdisciplinary project between the
groups of Philippe Reymond and Laurent Keller, a
postdoctoral position is available to study kin recog-
nition in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.
The successful candidate will test whether growth pat-
terns diﬀer when two related (kin treatment) or two un-
related (non-kin treatment) plants are grown close to-
gether. Whole-genome microarrays will be used to mea-
sure gene expression changes between kin and non-kin
treatments and genes potentially responsible for varia-
tion in the ability to recognize related individuals might
be identiﬁed.
Funding is available for two years, beginning Oc-
tober 2005. Candidates with background in plant
molecular biology, plant genetics, or experience with
kin selection are encouraged to apply. Applications
should include a cover letter detailing research inter-
ests and experience, a curriculum vitae, and the name
of three references. To apply for the position or for

Max-PlanckBerlin Humanmigrations
Postoctoral position to investigate human migrations
from Siberia to the Americas on the basis of the popu-
lation structure of Helicobacter pylori bacteria
Max-Planck Institut fuer Infektionsbiologie, Berlin
A postodoctoral position is available as of 1 December,2005 for a period of 21 months in the laboratory of Mark
Achtman. The population structure of H. pylori corre-
lates with human migrations (Science, 299L 1582-85,
2003) and can provide more information about recent
migrations than does mtDNA or microsatellites (PNAS,
101:4646-51, 2004). A project has been initiated to ex-
amine the sources of the Amerind migrations based on
the population structure of H. pylori isolated from dif-
ferent ethnic groups in Siberia. Other projects that are
planned include analysis of the population structures
of H. pylori from Central Asians and from Israelis of
diﬀerent religious, ethnic and geographical sources.
The successful applicant will have a proven track record
in population genetics and a strong interest in human
migrations. Knowledge of the Russian language and
of the ethnic composition of Siberia would be desirable
because it would facilitate communications with collab-
orators in Siberia and Moscow. Funding for ﬁeld work,
running costs and a technical assistant are in place until
late 2007 and can possibly be extended. We have al-
ready obtained proof of principle that this project will
work from initial analyses of samples from two loca-
tions and samples from an additional 4 locations will
be available by the end of 2005.

Post-doctoral fellowship in the Section on Genomic
Structure & Function, Laboratory of Molecular &
Cell Biology, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda MD 20892 USA
AVAILABILITY: January 2006
TOPIC:
Experimental analysis of evolutionary inferences using
the interaction between the mammalian L1 (LINE-1)
retrotransposon and its host as a model system.
SUMMARY:
L1 elements have been replicating and evolving in pri-
mates since 70 million years ago (MYA). During this
time novel L1 families repeatedly arose, only to go ex-
tinct coincident with the emergence of another novel
L1 family. This process has persisted to the present.
Thus, in the human lineage an L1 family that emerged
~3.5 MYA is being superseded by one that arose ~1
MYA. This family is rapidly amplifying, and increasing
the genetic diversity, but reducing the ﬁtness of modern
humans.
The presence of only a single evolutionary lineage of
L1 families during human evolution (and during the
evolution of most other mammals) presumably reﬂects
fundamental parameters that govern the interaction be-
tween the L1 element and its host. This important, but
largely unexplored, aspect of L1 biology is now a major
focus of our laboratory.
Our approach to L1 / host interaction is framed by the
assumption that evolutionary changes in L1 reﬂect in
part its response to the host. L1 evolution has been
characterized by both negative and positive selection;
i.e., by both conservation of structure and adaptive
changes. The latter changes often represent evolution-
ary responses to environmental factors (e.g., a virus to
the immune response of the host).
Accordingly, we recently identiﬁed a number of host
factors that interact uniquely with L1 components that
have undergone adaptive evolution. The functional
consequences (in terms of L1 retrotransposition) of the
adaptive changes in L1 are being correlated with their
biochemical and structural eﬀects. In addition, possi-
ble eﬀects of L1 components on the normal function of
these host factors are also being examined.
Other projects that involve L1 / host interaction are
also underway.

Perth MarineBiogeography
CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellowship, Perth, Australia (up
to 3 years):
Marine Molecular Ecology and Biogeography.
Capitalising on the wealth of multidisciplinary knowl-
edge ﬂowing from the Western Australian Strategic Re-
search Fund for the Marine Environment initiative this
project will exploit the power of the emerging science,
molecular ecology, to gain insights into how the distri-
butions of key marine organisms are inﬂuenced by phys-
ical, oceanographic, climatic and hydrodynamic pro-
cesses operating oﬀ Western Australia.
A central focus of our research is the inﬂuence of ocean
processes such as the Leeuwin Current, its eddies and
associated minor currents on the spatial and tempo-
ral dynamics of marine organisms, from zooplankton
to macroalgae. These inﬂuences are manifested partly
via dispersal of reproductive propagules within and be-
tween populations across local and geographic scales.
Understanding these processes is central to interpret-
ing the biological patterns observed in marine species.
It is also important to understand these processes if
marine reserves are to be eﬀective tools for conserving
biodiversity in exploited systems because it helps en-sure reserves are representative and viable.
The project will investigate dispersal, gene ﬂow, biogeo-
graphical patterns and evolutionary relationships using
DNA-based genetic markers and models of dispersal
and population dynamics. Biogeographic patterns ob-
served in WA will be related to larger scale, continent,
and basin-wide ocean processes. CSIRO at Floreat has
ideal facilities with which to conduct this research, in-
cluding modern molecular biology laboratories and an
impressive capacity to conduct ﬁeld based marine bio-
logical research.
This will be a well resourced postdoc and the research
environment in which it will be conducted is extremely
stimulating and dynamic. Furthermore, the lifestyle
and climate in Perth is about as good as it gets. I
encourage good early career molecular ecologists and
phylogeneticists not to miss this opportunity.
Details of the application process will be posted on
the CSIRO website by August 5 2005 ( www.csiro.au/-
careers ).

ArabidopsisRootMorphology
Postdoctoral Position
Ecological relevance of a natural genetic variation in
root system morphology in Arabidopsis thaliana
The phenotypic variation observed between individu-
als or populations is partly the result of exposure to
diﬀerent environments and partly the result of genetic
diﬀerences. Genetic diﬀerences drive adaptive evolu-
tion of organisms to changes in environmental condi-
tions. We have exploited natural genetic variation to
isolate a novel regulator of root system morphology in
the model plant system Arabidopsis thaliana, the BRE-
VIS RADIX (BRX) gene (Mouchel, Briggs & Hardtke
2004, Genes & Development, 18: 700-714). BRX is a
novel plant-speciﬁc gene and the founding member of
the highly conserved BRX gene family. The activities
of the corresponding proteins are currently being inves-
tigated.
As part of an interdisciplinary project between the
groups of Christian Hardtke ( <http://www.unil.ch/-
dbmv>http://www.unil.ch/dbmv ) and Giorgina
Bernasconi ( <http://www.unil.ch/dee >http://-
www.unil.ch/dee ), a postdoctoral position is available
to study natural genetic variation in root morphology
in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. The
successful candidate will test whether the naturally
occurring loss-of-function BRX allele confers an adap-
tive advantage in its natural habitat or in particular
physiological conditions. This will include analysis of
competition within- and between genotypes in tissue
culture and greenhouse experiments, and mapping of
BRX genotypes in natural populations.
Funding is available for two years, beginning October
2005. Applications are invited from scientists with
skills and interests in plant evolutionary ecology, ex-
perimental design and statistical analysis. Basic skills
in molecular biology would be a plus. Please send your
application including a cover letter detailing research

Adaptation to anthropogenic environmental change:
the molecular genetic basis of industrial melanism in
peppered moths
Industrial melanism in the peppered moth, Biston be-
tularia, is among the best examples of rapid adapta-
tion to environmental change, but little is known about
the evolutionary origins and molecular identity of the
underlying polymorphism for melanism. This project
seeks to characterise the molecular genetics and devel-
opmental pathway controlling the melanic phenotype in
B. betularia as a means to address the broader evolu-
tionary questions. A longer-term aim is to detect hitch-
hiking around the putative polymorphism and to in-
terpret patterns of linkage disequilibrium on melanism
clines in relation to selection and gene ﬂow. The work
will involve close collaboration with Mike Quail (Sanger
Institute) and Paul Dear (MRC) in Cambridge, and
John True at Stony Brook New York.
The candidate should have a background in popula-
tion/evolutionary genetics and experience in: general
molecular biology, ideally including AFLP, ABI 3100
and sequence analysis; linkage mapping; and insect hus-
bandry. Starting salary is 22,774 - 25,633 GBP per an-
num depending on experience and the preferred starting
period is October-December 2005.
To apply and for further information, please send
a covering letter and your CV with the names
and contact details of 3 referees to Ilik Saccheri
(<mailto:saccheri@liv.ac.uk >saccheri@liv.ac.uk). The
closing date is 19 August 2005.

Beyond BLAST and FASTA - Alignment: from pro-
teins to genomes - This course presents a comprehen-sive overview of the theory and practice of computa-
tional methods for extracting the maximum amount of
information from protein and DNA sequence similarity
through sequence database searches, statistical analy-
sis, and multiple sequence alignment, and genome scale
alignment. Additional topics include gene ﬁnding, den-
tifying signals in unaligned sequences, integration of ge-
netic and sequence information in biological databases.
The course combines lectures with hands-on exercises;
students are encouraged to pose challenging sequence
analysis problems using their own data. The course
makes extensive use of local WWW pages to present
problem sets and the computing tools to solve them.
Students use Windows and Mac workstations attached
to a UNIX server; participants should be comfortable
using the Unix operating system and a Unix text editor.
The course is designed for biologists seeking advanced
training in biological sequence analysis, computational
biology core resource directors and staﬀ, and for scien-
tists in other disciplines, such as computer science, who66 EvolDir August 1, 2005
wish to survey current research problems in biological
sequence analysis and comparative genomics.
The primary focus of the Computational and Compar-
ative Genomics Course is the theory and practice of al-
gorithms used in computational biology, with the goal
of using current methods more eﬀectively and develop-
ing new algorithms. Cold Spring Harbor also oﬀers an
Advanced Bioinformatics Programming course, which
focuses more on software development.
Over the past few years, the course has been expanded
to cover more algorithms and exercises on comparative
genomics and genome databases.

GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS WORKSHOP
IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AMES, IOWA, USA
May 29 - June 2, 2006
An NSF-sponsored Morphometrics workshop will be
held at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA from
May 29 to June 2, 2006. The instructors will be: Dean
C. Adams (Iowa State University), F. James Rohlf
(SUNY Stony Brook), and Dennis E. Slice (University
of Vienna). Keynote speaker: Fred L. Bookstein (Uni-
versity of Washington).
This is a 1-week workshop which provides a compre-
hensive introduction to both the theory and methods
for the analysis of biological shape. Emphasis is on un-
derstanding the theoretical background of the ﬁeld, as
well as the practical mechanics of both landmark and
outline methods for shape analysis. The main objective
of the workshop is to provide students with suﬃcient
knowledge of these approaches that they will be able
to eﬀectively and correctly apply them to their own
research programs. Applications in Ecology and Evo-
lution will be emphisized.
The workshop is limited to 20 participants who willbe provided with travel grants that include room and
board during the workshop. Applications must be re-
ceived by OCTOBER 1, 2005 to receive full considera-
tion.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
