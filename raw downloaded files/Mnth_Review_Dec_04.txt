Maastricht EvolEconomics Nov22-23
Since economic activities are important determinants
of people’s success, economic circumstances will inﬂu-
ence the evolutionary selection process, while human
diversity will aﬀect economic performance. Combining
the biological and economic perspective can improve
our insight in both disciplines: What role does human
diversity play in explaining economic performance and
how does the human evolution adjust to economic cir-
cumstances? Such a genetic and cultural co-evolution
can be related to a number of issues concerning human
cooperation, sexual selection and parental investments
in children.
On 22 and 23 November 2004 we organize a workshop
in Maastricht to bring together leading biologists and
economists who are interested in the interplay between
biology and economics. The workshop is sponsored by
the Dutch Science Foundation as a part of their Evolu-
tion and Behavior research program.

Bremerhaven Phaeocystis microsat
PhP studentship available for 3 years from the DFG
(German Research Council) to study genetic diversity
in the polar haptophyte Phaeocystis antartica using
microsatellites. Current knowledge based on ITS se-
quencing shows that ancestral populations occur in theACC (antarctic circumpolar current) and then diverge
sequentially in the major continental seas surrounging
Antarctica. The goal of this project is to measure gene
ﬂow around Antarctica and into the various gyres, such
as the Weddell Sea, the Scotia Sea, etc. Excursions to
Antarctica are possible. Applications can be made un-
til November 30 2004 quoting 67/11-1 and mailed to

Seeking Master’s Students
I would appreciate if the readers of evoldir could let any
potentially interested undergraduates know about this
opportunity. Thanks.
I am looking for 1-2 students who are interested in
conducting research for a Master’s degree. The goal
of this NSF-funded project is to examine aspects
of the ecological genetics of biological invasions us-
ing the plant Silene latifolia. Thesis research will
include working on experimental common gardens
in several North American and European sites.
Support for this position includes a combination
of research and teaching assistantships. Interested
students should contact Lorne Wolfe for more infor-
mation (912-681-0848, wolfe@georgiasouthern.edu,

Section of Evolutionary Biology
Promovendus(PhD) position (full-time)
Project: “Mechanisms of adaptation: analysis of geo-
graphic variation in a polyphenic butterﬂy”
The Promovendus will work in the Section Evolution-
ary Biology with Paul Brakeﬁeld and Bas Zwaan. One
of the model organisms in this group is the tropical
seasonal butterﬂy Bicyclus anynana which is eminently
suitable for studying the mechanisms of adaptation.
This butterﬂy exhibits high genetic variation as well as
adaptive phenotypic plasticity for the suite of traits as-
sociated with temperature adaptation. We understand
how genetic and phenotypic correlations among life his-
tory traits have been shaped by natural selection and
how these traits relate to ﬁtness. This project will useexisting clines with latitude in this butterﬂy to explore
the nature of the genetic and developmental changes
that might occur in response to changes in temperature.
By using a variety of tools to compare populations that
diﬀer extensively in their temperature environment and
the association with rainfall, we will study the mech-
anisms of adaptation at the genetical, developmental
and physiological levels. Application of this fully in-
tegrated approach will provide novel insights into the
mechanisms of genetic adaptation, and also into the role
of phenotypic plasticity herein. Furthermore, it will ad-
dress the issues of potential constraints in adaptive evo-
lution and the rates of evolutionary change, especially
with respect to responses to man-made change.
The project is funded by N.W.O., Aard- en Lev-
enswetenschappen, for four years.
Requirements: Experience of working with insects in
the context of evolutionary genetics would be an ad-
vantage. The successful candidate should have an abil-
ity to work with whole organisms and large data sets,
as well as in the molecular laboratory, but crucially
should also have experience with working under (trop-
ical) ﬁeld situations. They should also be interested in
working at the boundaries between diﬀerent areas of
biology. He/she will work in an active research group
encompassing a wide variety of diﬀerent projects.
The appointment is for a maximum of 4 years and is
expected to lead to the completion of a dissertation.
The gross monthly salary is 1.702 in the ﬁrst year and
increases progressively each year to 2.283 in the fourth
year. Salary and fringe beneﬁts conform to the Collec-
tive Employment Agreement for Dutch Universities.

versity
Research Training Program in the Genetic Architecture
of Quantitative Traits
The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of
the National Institutes of Health has awarded the De-
partment of Genetics an Institutional Research Train-
ing Grant for predoctoral training in “The Genetic Ar-
chitecture of Quantitative Traits.”
Quantitative, or complex, traits are aﬀected by multi-
ple interacting genes, each of which have small eﬀects
and are sensitive to the environment. Understanding
the molecular nature of genetic variation for quantita-
tive traits will have an enormous impact on medicine,
livestock and crop breeding, and the study of evolution.
For over half a century North Carolina State University
has been a leading center for research in quantitative
genetics. To enable future scientists to advance our un-
derstanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative
traits, we oﬀer a research and training program that in-
tegrates quantitative, population, molecular and devel-
opmental genetics, statistics and molecular evolution.
Our program oﬀers:
* $20,772 stipend with tuition and health insurance *
Travel allowance and research funds * State-of-the-art
research facilities * Internationally recognized faculty
with expertise in theoretical and experimental quanti-
tative genetics * A stimulating academic environment
near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Duke University and the Research Triangle Park * A
beautiful and aﬀordable location with a pleasant cli-
mate between the beaches and the Appalachian moun-
tainsUS citizens and permanent residents are eligible for
Fellowships. The Department of Genetics is strongly
committed to promoting diversity in the scientiﬁc com-
munity and encourages applications from individuals of
historically under-represented minority groups.

UBerne MatingSystems
PHD POSITION ON THE CHARACTERIZATION
OF MATING SYSTEM AND DISPERSAL ABILI-
TIES FROM GENETIC DATA
Applications are invited for PhD position in the
Computational and Molecular Population Genetics
lab (CMPG, Zoology Institute, University of Berne,
Switzerland), starting on January 1, 2005, or soon
thereafter.
We are looking for a highly motivated biology student
to work on the characterization of mating system and
dispersal abilities from genetic data, mainly through
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques8 EvolDir December 1, 2004
(e.g. Beaumont et al. 2002). These techniques in-
volve massive simulations of genetic data, which are
then confronted to observations for parameter estima-
tions. The underlying biological/evolutionary models
that are simulated can be arbitrarily complex, and will
be spatially explicit in our case. We plan to partic-
ularly focus on populations that have gone through a
recent range expansion (e.g. Ray et al. 2003, Excoﬃer
2004). The PhD project should have a strong theoret-
ical/modeling/simulation component, but the student
will need to apply his/her methodologies on organisms
studied in the CMPG lab (e.g. freshwater ﬁshes, voles,
humans).
Previous experience in population genetics, statistics
and computer programming (C++) are required.
The CMPG lab is well equipped with computational
tools including a 40-nodes Linux cluster, on which sim-
ulations and computations will be performed.
Applicants should send (before December 1st) a mo-
tivation letter, a CV, a publication list, and the
names and emails of two references to Laurent Ex-
coﬃer, CMPG, Zoology Institute, University of Berne,

Graduate student position in evolutionary biology
I am looking for an enthusiastic and dedicated person to
carry on Ph.D. studies in my laboratory at the Univer-
sit´ e du Qu´ ebec ` a Rimouski. Research in my lab is cen-
tered around evolutionary aspects of polyploidy using
the cladoceran Daphnia as a model organism. Topics of
interests include : 1) the evolutionary fate of gene du-
plication in polyploid Daphnia (cDNA-AFLP analyses
will be carried out on parental diploid and allopoly-
ploid clones to estimate global rates of gene silencing),
2) cytonuclear interactions in allopolyploids, and 3) the
eﬀects of mutation accumulations on phenotypic char-
acters of polyploid and diploid clones. As the genome of
Daphnia pulex is being sequenced, many genomic tools
are now available and will be of great value to carry on
the above projects.
Candidates with a M.Sc. or equivalent and with
an interest in evolutionary genetics, preferably with
an experience in molecular techniques should send
via e-mail a letter of motivation, a CV, and theDecember 1, 2004 EvolDir 9

RCUK Academic Fellowships
Research Councils UK has recently announced the
award of nearly 400 new Academic Fellowships to pro-
vide contract researchers with more attractive and sta-
ble paths into academia. Each Fellowship oﬀers train-
ing and development necessary for the transition from a
research focussed post into an academic position within
ﬁve years, and the guarantee of a permanent academic
position at the end of the award (subject to the suc-
cessful completion of a probationary period).
Following a successful bid, the University of Notting-
ham invites applications for Academic Fellowships in
the research areas of:
Functional Imaging (from single cell to whole organism)
(Three Fellowship posts) Organisms and Populations:
Genetics and Genomics (Two Fellowship posts)
It is hoped to oﬀer further Fellowships in these areas
during 2005/2006.
Over the ﬁve-year period of the Fellowship, the success-
ful candidates will mostly carry out research aimed at
developing an independent career, but will also under-
take teaching experience, outreach activities and train-
ing and development relevant to an academic position.
Candidates must have a PhD, or be of postdoctoral
standing (someone who can demonstrate equivalent and
relevant professional experience), and be able to demon-
strate their outstanding research potential.
The partial funding provided by RCUK is ﬂexibleenough to accommodate those who may have their own
funding initially (e.g. via existing Fellowship or Re-
search Council grant), but not for the later years of the
Academic Fellowship. Applications from such individ-
uals are particularly welcome.
Salary will be within the range £21,460 - £29,128 per
annum, depending on qualiﬁcations and experience.
Informal enquiries may be addressed to
marie.downs@nottingham.ac.uk.

UppsalaU SystematicBotany
Uppsala University announces a position as
Chair in Systematic Botany at the Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Centre of Uppsala University, in the Department of
Evolution, Genomics and Systematics, www.egs.uu.se
Description of the subject ﬁeld: Plant systematics
with special emphasis on phylogenetic and evolution-
ary problems.
Tasks: Comprehensive responsibility for research and
postgraduate studies within the area of systematic
botany, teaching and supervision of PhD-students
and undergraduate students. Research in systematic
botany. Information about research and development
and planning of new research projects, and administra-
tion at department or higher level.
Qualiﬁcations: According to Chap. 4, §5 of the Higher
Education Ordinance the eligibility criteria for employ-
ment as full professor are scientiﬁc as well as pedagogic
proﬁciency. According to the employment policy of
Uppsala University, the scientiﬁc proﬁciency should be
demonstrated through independent research that sig-
niﬁcantly exceeds the qualiﬁcations required for the
Swedish “docent” title. Also, experience of scientiﬁc
planning and leadership is required. The applicant
must have the pedagogic proﬁciency required for the
position and, normally, formal pedagogic training rele-
vant for the educational tasks associated with this po-
sition. The assessment of pedagogical proﬁciency will
focus on planning, execution and evaluation of teach-
ing, as well as on advisory activities and examination.
The ability to teach in Swedish or English is required.
The holder is expected to teach and take part in meet-
ings in Swedish within two years.December 1, 2004 EvolDir 29
Ranking: For this position, the ranking will be based
primarily on the scientiﬁc and pedagogic proﬁciencies of
the applicants, with special emphasis on scientiﬁc proﬁ-
ciency. This order of priorities in the application of the
diﬀerent selection criteria is not absolute. A combined
consideration of all grounds of assessment could result,
for instance, in an applicant vastly superior regarding
pedagogical proﬁciency being ranked higher than a can-
didate with superior scientiﬁc qualiﬁcations who is con-
sidered less qualiﬁed pedagogically.
In examining the scientiﬁc proﬁciency special attention
will be given to research in plant systematics with spe-
cial emphasis on phylogenetic and evolutionary prob-
lems. In examining the pedagogic proﬁciency, skills and
experience in the planning, execution and evaluation of
teaching, as well as advisory activities and examination
will be considered.
The ranking of applicants for employment as a teacher
at Uppsala University is based on an assessment of their
proﬁciencies in the areas required for eligibility for em-
ployment.
In addition, administrative and other qualiﬁcations rel-
evant to the subject and to the tasks connected to the
position will be assessed. Documented ability to attract
external funding is essential. Skills in developing and
leading research and personnel, in intra- and extramu-
ral co-operation and in the communication of research
and development will be considered. Personal suitabil-
ity will also be considered.
The University of Uppsala aims at an equal gender rep-
resentation. Since most full professors in the Faculty
are men, women are encouraged to seek this position.
Personal circumstances that may be of relevance when
judging the qualiﬁcations, for example parental leave,
should be mentioned in the list of qualiﬁcations (CV).

oratory technician to assist with research projects in
behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology (In par-
ticular, working with Dr. Dustin Penn and his group
on the Major Histocompatibility Complex). Applicants
should have excellent bench skills using molecular ge-
netic techniques (especially, DNA extractions, PCR,
microsatellite development and typing, AFLPs, auto-
matic sequencing, etc.). They should be independent,
reliable, and responsible for general laboratory mainte-
nance. The position requires working with other tech-
nicians, scientists, and assisting students; therefore, we
seek someone who is friendly, and cooperative, as well
as having excellent technical and organizational skills.
German would be useful but it is not necessary as ours

Alcohol alternatives
Dear All, Does any of you know a substance that stains
ethanol to some ugly looking colour and/or has ugly
smell/taste and does not aﬀect subsequent PCRs of the
scat samples stored in it? I’m afraid pure alcohol can be
too attractive to some collectors. Simply, I need some
repellent. Any suggestions are welcome Best regards

Beckman Analyzer experience
Folks:
We are looking into purchasing a capillary-based Auto-
mated Sequencing System with both DNA sequencing
and fragment genotyping for our Core Sequencing fa-
cility. Most of our users are doing DNA sequencing of
cloned DNA, but we have several users like myself who
sequence mostly PCR products and also do AFLP and
microsatellite fragment genotyping. We are looking for
a machine with the widest versatility and best resolu-
tion for all of these applications.
We are considering the Beckman Coulter CEG 8000
Genetic Analyzer because it is a capillary machine with
Sequencing and Fragment Analysis software included in
the same package and is considerably cheaper than the
ABI 3100 or 3730 (systems that I have used and am
familiar with).
So I am looking for feedback (positive or negative) from
anyone out there who has experience either with se-
quencing or fragment analysis using the Beckman sys-
tem.
We only have a limited fund source to buy a machine,
but I want to spend our money wisely.
Please send responses to: Margaret Ptacek (mp-
tacek@clemson.edu)
Thanks in advance for any comments.
Cheers, –Margaret Ptacek

DNA from formaldehyde
Dear EvolDir-members,
As part of my PhD-project, I want to make a DNA-
based phylogeny of the genus Diplocephalus (a dwarf
spider genus), using the nuclear rDNA-region (18S, 5.8S
and intergenic spacers ITS1 and ITS2).
I am still in the stage of isolating and amplifying the
DNA from my spiders, but I have troubles ﬁnding spec-
imens of all species I need. Therefore, an easier way
to acquire all specimens would be to include material
from pitfalls. However, pitfall-traps are usually ﬁlled
with an aqueous formaldehyde solution (e.g. 4%) and
a bit of dishwashing liquid (to break the surface ten-
sion), and the formaldehyde seems to have a degrading
impact on the DNA. I have tried isolating DNA from
pitfall-caught specimens, using my default DNA isola-
tion protocol (Puregene from BIOzym), but this didn’t
yield any DNA.
If anyone has experience with isolating DNA from
formaldehyde-caught specimens, and/or could give me
advice on what protocol to use, I would be very pleased
to hear.
Also, if anyone would have spare specimens of Diplo-
cephalus sp. (Araneae, Linyphiidae, Erigoninae) or
could easily collect them, they would be very welcome.
Please contact me for details on what species I need
most.
Many thanks in advance.

www.ecology.UGent.be/terecDNA ladder answers
A couple of weeks ago, I posted the following message:
I am wondering if anyone knows of a com-
mercially available DNA ladder suitable for sizing mi-
crosatellites? I am running manual small format 6%
acrylamide gels (Sequagel), staining with Sybr-Gold
and visualizing under UV light. I would like to know if
anyone knows of a commercially available DNA ladder,
with fragments sizes from around 80 - 250 bp in incre-
ments of 10bp (or less). With ﬁngers crossed!
Thanks to all those who replied, I am now trying out
the Invitrogen 10 bp ladder. I have compiled the re-
sponses I received below:
1/ MOST POPULAR SUGGESTION: Invitrogen 10
bp ladder - catalogue number 10821-015 - 10 bp steps
from 30 - 330 bp. (One respondent also said: They also
sell a 330 - 30 bp AFLP ladder (cat no. 10832-012)
which is exactly the same thing but costs more so buy
the former.)
2/ I found two products that could work but I did not
try them: Superladder-low 20bp ladder (ABgene) and
PCR low ladder (SIgma). Those ladders have 20 bp in-
crements, which may not be enough for your purpose.
3/ 10 bp ladder from GibcoBRL in the past with decent
results, which covers your size range. It would depend
on your markers, but I also used Gibco’s 25 bp lad-
der with some markers - this one sometimes runs more
cleanly. - Kate Teeter
4/ SECOND MOST POPULAR SUGGESTION: the
Elchrom M3 marker ( www.elchrom.com ) might do
what you want. The attached poster shows the frag-
ment sizes.
4/ DeWoody JA. Schupp J. Keneﬁc L. Busch J. Mur-
ﬁtt L. Keim P. Universal method for producing ROX-
labeled size standards suitable for automated genotyp-
ing. [Article] /Biotechniques. 37(3):348-+, 2004 Sep.
The above techniques requires $300 buck up front for
material and some time, but it beats the exorbitant
rates of ABI. Of course you wouldn’t need to label the
primers since you are using Sybr gold. You would see
both DNA stands through, not sure if that would mess
up the analysis.
5/ I’d bet that you’ve thought of this but just incase,
would it be pratical for you to sequence one of your
samples and run the sequence on the same gel? I thinkDecember 1, 2004 EvolDir 33
that it is a good idea to sequence at least some of your
samples anyway to verify that size polymorphism is a
result of diﬀerent tandem repeat copy number and not
ﬂanking indels. A beneﬁt of running a sequence on a
microsat gel is of course that the resulting “ladder” has
a 1bp resolution. All the best. Cam

Heteroplasmy
Dear friends,
I am currently facing a problem of mtDNA sequences.
I got two diﬀerent (similarity is ca 20%) COI sequences
from one individual. They are from two diﬀerent sets
of primers to amplify mostly the same region of COI.
The same kind of problem occurrs in about 10 diﬀer-
ent specimens now. Of course, if you make a tree fromthese, you get a wrong tree by grouping this species
with other species but not with its own species. Does
anyone have this kind of problem or know a reasonable
explanation? Please let me know if there are papers
on multiple diﬀerent copies of mt in an individual, or
maybe NUMT?

Heteroplasmy 2
To those who responded promptly,Thank you for all the
comments, advice, and your papers. They will be a big
help for me.
Some want to know a little more details about the data
so here it is.
The sample is giant water bug, a hemipteran insect.
Iam doingapopulation study ofspecies A, and I includ-
edspecies B and C that are close to A andspecies O
as an outgroup in the study.The region I sequencedis
a part of COI,less than500bp closer toward 5’. One of
the reason I included B and C is to make a molecular
identiﬁcation marker for these morphologically similar
A and C (B is similar but distinguishable).
When I quickly draw NJ tree with these, species A is de-
vided into 3 groups, group 1 with 29 individuals, group
2 with 3 individuals, and group 3 with 4 individuals.
In the tree, the group 1 is grouped with the species B,
the group 2 is grouped with the species C and together
form a sister group of (group 1 and species B), and the
group 3 becomes the sister taxon for all the rest.
((((group 1, species B)(group 2, species C))group
3)species O)
The pairwise distances for the 3 groups shows the dif-
ference within the group 1, 2, and 3 is 0.00 - 0.02, 0.00
- 0.01, and 0.00 - 0.01, respectively. Thediﬀerence be-
tween group 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 is 0.29 - 0.32,
0.19 - 0.21, and 0.30 - 0.31, respectively.
In the mean time, the diﬀerence between species A and
B, A and C, and B and C is about 0.14 - 0.31, 0.30 -
0.35, and 0.30 - 0.31.
Now everything becomes unclear. Furthermore, when34 EvolDir December 1, 2004
translated into amino acid, I found no stop codons in all
of my sequences (except one a.a. missing in the middle
if I remember correctly). The 29 individuals from group
1 are from everywhere in Korea, the 3 individuals from
group 2 are from two places but the two places are very
close: within a couple of miles, but the 4 individules
from group 3 are from three diﬀerent places and they
are far apart (diﬀerent provinces).
Just before I sent the previousquestion email two days
ago, I ampliﬁed the same (actually longer towards 5’)
region, using with a diﬀerent 5’ primer, from group 2
and 3, one indiviual each, and then got the same or
very similar sequencesto those of group 1. This means
the group 2 and 3 somehow have two diﬀerent mtDNA
at least partly. I thought I could seeat least a fewstop
codons if they are pseudogenes though the sequence
length is not that long. So, are they due to hetero-
plasmy?
I may do some tests and gene walking to know where
they are, but is it worth to publish? Is there anyone
who has good experience on it with similar problems in
insects?

LongSAGE training
Greetings, I am a graduate student at Oregon State
University and am studying gene expression levels re-
lating to migration times between spring and fall chi-
nook salmon. I want to use the LongSAGE approach
to analyze it, but as it is technically exhaustive would
like to save some time by visiting a lab currently en-
gaged in LongSAGE experiments to learn the process.
Is anyone currently working with LongSAGE with ani-
mals in a lab in the west coast or rocky mountain areas
of the US? If so, would you be receptive to a visitor for
a short visit to learn the LongSAGE ropes?

Microsat stutters
Hi,
I am a graduate student attempting to use microsatel-
lites to study population genetics. I have been at it for
2 years now and have thoroughly exhausted all avenues
available to me in an attempt to solve a stutter prob-
lem on an ABI 377. I am using cattle primers that are
known to work on my species and out of 20 have 10 that
will amplify up with PCR, but when ran on the ABI
377 I end up with lots of non-speciﬁc bands and the de-
sired bands have anywhere from 3 to 7 peaks to them
making it impossible to tell the size of the allele. I have
checked on a WAVE machine that my primers are in
fact the same correct size, tried diﬀerent taqs, and done
optimization with my PCR. Nothing works. My PCRcycle is 12.5 ul with 40 rounds, an annealing tempera-
ture of 58 to 60 followed by a 30 minute extension at
72. I dont think it is an A+ problem because my PCR
reaction would more than likely put As on everything
given the number of cycles and time around 70 degrees.
Furthermore, I dont think this would account for 6 to
7 bands. I have seen the electropherograms of others
and they do not have the stutter issue. I use Cambrex
gel packs to make my gels, let the gels set up for about
3 hours, run my PCR the day I do it, take 0.5 ul of two
separate PCR reactions and add 3 ul of a 5:1:1 mix of
formamide:dye:ROX400 ladder, use 96 well membrane
combs, add 0.8 ul to each well, and run for 2.5 hours.
Does anybody else have stutter issues? Any sugges-
tions to reduce stutters without buying new primers?
If I do not get this issue resolved within the next couple
of months I will be forced to pursue a diﬀerent project
for my Ph.D. and be extremely disappointed. So any
help, advice, or suggestions are welcome since I am at
a standstill right now.
Thank you

RESPONSES TO MICROSAT STUTTERS Below I
have grouped the responses so far received to reduce
stutters, thank you to everyone who has responded!
The most common response was to reduce the number
of cycles. Followed by reduce the MgCl concentration.
Also a mix of PCR cycle options with a high initial an-
nealing temperature either through a Touch down pro-
cess or a few said plain heating your PCR before you
put the polymerase in. Two-step PCR was mentioned
more than just heating your reaction without taq. Also
as popular was to reduce the extension time at the end.
About 3-4 people said speciﬁcally to try hot start taq.
After the combined PCR suggestions commonly stated
was to just redesign reverse primers according to the
Pig-tail method (Brownstein et al. 1996, Biotechniques
20, 1004-1010).
Since then I have reduced the number of cycles, then
also shortened the extension time. Then with the short-
ened number of cycles and extension time varied MgCl
from 1.5 to 2.5 because the person who uses them suc-
cessfully now says not to go out of this range. I have
also kept the 2.5 MgCl as original, but added BSA. I
am currently looking over the results, but wanted to
pass along the feedback I have been getting.
Again THANK YOU very much to all who responded.
PCR REACTION CHANGES Varying Mg++ levels,
maybe try a gradient from 1-4mM, lower MgCl helps to
reduce stutters. Use hot start Taq Change concentra-
tion of your primers. We use a starting concentration of
only 0.5uM of our labeled primer and then the reverse
(unlabeled) is 2uM. My labmates have found that bet-
ter bands sometimes come with changing the labeled
primer to either 0.3uM or 0.7uM. We were told that
it’s good to have the reverse primer in higher concen-
tration. Try out t4 polymerase
PCR CYCLE CHANGES Reduce the number of cy-
cles down as low as possible, 40 cycles is excessive and
try 25 cycles o “increasing the number of cycles may
increase nonspeciﬁc background and may lead to arti-
facts” (source: Qiagen multiplex pcr handbook, 2002,
p.33) Use a very stringent annealing temp Set your
ﬁnal extension to 70 degrees or 65 degrees for 45 mins
(see Proﬁler Plus manual for Proﬁler Plus kit used on
humans). I had some loci which were tricky to score
until our lab stumbled across the reaction conditions
used for Proﬁler Plus kit. Touch down’ PCR program
o start Tm at 65C or 67C and the annealing temp re-
duced 2C per cycle for the next cycles up to TmX, then
the remaining cycles at a 58C annealing temperature o
start at 60C and within the ﬁrst 10 cycles down the Ta
to 50C, then keep 50C for the next 30 cycles o start at
60C and within the ﬁrst 10 cycles down the Ta to 50C,then keep 50C for the next 30 cycles short PCR“ o cy-
cles of 15s at 94, 15s at annealing temperature and 45s
at 72 and lower the number of cycles. I’ve heard people
sometimes run only 5s at annealing temperature Hot-
start PCR with regular promega taq by performing a
ﬁrst denaturing step with DNA, primers and water and
then lower the temperature for about 85C to add the
master mix containing taq and all the other reagents.
I’ve performed 12.5 ul reactions, primer concentrations
ranging from as low as 0.03 to 1.2uM in multiplexes.
Annealing temperatures were 58C for most primer sets
and 60C. I also recommend the Quiagen multiplex PCR
mix, that provides a taq appropriate for hotstart PCR.
No 72C extension step in the cycle (I mean that I have
the annealing step followed by the denaturing step and
then annealing again, with the Taq extending during
the ramp, for microsats is more then necessary), and
only 2 minutes of ﬁnal extension step. Biotechniques
suggested abbreviated cycling times for PCR steps. For
instance, denature for only 2 seconds, anneal for 2 sec-
onds, extend for 8 seconds. I’ve often used this ”2/2/8“
protocol (or some variant, e.g. 3/3/12) to clean up mi-
crosatellite stutter. Sometimes it fails miserably, but in
about 50% of the cases it helps dramatically. Try heat-
ing your PCR without taq in it for 15min @95C,then
adding taq Two-step PCR o 30sec at 94C and 80 sec at
50C. Also here is the reference that uses the suggested
cycle Here is the reference: &#61607; YoshiadK, Awaji

nealing at 62-65, with no elongation step- this sometime

PRIMERS Re-designing the reverse primers the way
that you add GTTT to 5’end, i.e. if your original primer
has A,G,C, at 5’end add GTTT, if it ends by T, add
GTT, if by TT add just GT etc. You may ﬁnd info in

PCR reaction numbers
Dear members of the Evoldir,
I am trying to optimize the number of PCR reactions
that can be done with DNA extracted from one single
fruit ﬂy. I am not able of performing as many reactions
as I need, and that’s why I am posting the following
questions to the Evoldir:
1- I have the feeling that ethanol puriﬁcation of DNA
is not the most optimal puriﬁcation method. Do you
know of any other method (ﬁlters, columns, etc...) that
gives a higher yield of DNA per extraction? IMPOR-
TANT: Since I have a quite large number of ﬂies to
analyze, a method that uses microtiter plates for the
extraction would be more convenient.
2- Have you ever tried to recycle the genomic DNA
used in a PCR? if so, what method did you use to re-
isolate the genomic DNA from PCR mix? and also, howreliable are PCR results of reactions using “recycled”
DNA?
3- Has anybody experience in Multiplex PCR for popu-
lation genetics studies? how reliable is the information
obtained from multiplex PCR?
Thank you,

Pub quality phylogenies
Hello,38 EvolDir December 1, 2004
Two items: one practical, one discussion oriented.
First I am seeking advice on software / instructions for
converting a NEXUS tree into a publication quality im-
age.
Second, my tree contains >200 taxa. How are peo-
ple handling such phylogenies for publication purposes?
This is an issue that has not been adequately addressed
by journals, and I am soliciting opinions on what should
be done about this (especially since everyday phylogeny
size gets larger and larger). Should the image be saved
to the internet for download? Publish subtrees of inter-
est with remainder as an online appendix? If so, what
type of ﬁle?

Reviewer Accountability
Dear Colleagues
I would like to gauge whether there is any support forthe idea of no anonymity for reviewers. I believe it
would be a positive step forward for scientiﬁc communi-
cation if reviewers signed their name to their evaluation
of manuscripts. It would encourage more thoughtful
critiques, reduce cronyism, and bring us a step closer
to being accountable as scientists.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could spare the time
and cast your vote as follows.
Those in favour of signing your name as a reviewer reply
YES
Those in favour of the status quo reply NO
I’ll post the results to the list if there is suﬃcient inter-
est.

SSCP DGGE dHPLC
I am attempting to obtain nuclear sequences for my
Ph.D. project. I am ﬁnding plenty of heterozygosity
and am looking for the best methods to separate the
alleles for subsequent reampliﬁcation via PCR and then
sequencing. I’ve read about the possibility of using a
number of methods other than cloning to obtain nu-
clear haplotype data. Methods that I am considering
include SSCP (Single strand conformational polymor-
phism), DGGE (Denaturing gradient gel electrophore-
sis), and dHPLC (Denaturing high performance liquid
chromatography).
I am looking for individuals who have used any of these
techniques to separate alleles for subsequent sequenc-
ing. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each
approach? How much does it cost to get sequences
from one individual for both alleles? What about time
commitment? Special equipment?
I will gladly post a summary of replies within the nextweek or two.
Thanks for your help!

Software Clann
Hi, Just to announce that we have released a new ver-
sion of Clann at:
http://bioinf.may.ie/software/clann/ For those that
may be unfamiliar with Clann:
Clann is a sofware program for investigating phyloge-
netic information through Supertree analyses.
Clann has recently been published in Bioinfor-
matics: http://bioinformatics.oupjournals.org/cgi/-
content/abstract/bti020v1 This version of Clann
(2.0.3) implements four supertree methods (which are
used as optimality criteria):
Matrix Representation using Parsimony (But Paup* is
necessary for the parsimony part) Maximum Quartet
ﬁt Maximum Split (component) ﬁt Most Similar Su-
pertree Method (A novel method related to the average
consensus method with branch lengths set to unity)
For each of these optimality criteria, Clann allows:
Searches of supertree-space using Exhaustive or Heuris-
tic searches (NNI & SPR) Searches of User-deﬁned
trees. Investigation into the support for various hy-
potheses through: Bootstrapping (at the source tree
level) YAPTP tests (a randomisation test similar to
the ptp test)
New Features: Sampling of supertree space before
heuristic searches Introduction of Neighbor joining on
MRP matrices Readline library for ease of use Several
bugs ﬁxed
Clann is freely available to the scientiﬁc community at:

Software GASP
GCMSAnalysisSoftwarePackage
Dear Evoldir
We are releasing a new cross-platform application to or-
ganize and align metabolomics data. GASP (GC/MS
Analysis Software Package) is a software that allows
the comparison of compounds and peaks generated by
GC/MS instruments.
It can be run on Windows and Linux machines and is
able to deal with large amounts of data. The main as-
pect of the program is the capability of showing shared
and unique compounds in diﬀerent samples, by aligning
the peaks and checking spectra compositions. Usually
GC/MS instruments have been used in metabolomics
analysis of plants, bacteria, among other biological sam-
ples.
GASP accepts inputs from diﬀerent sources of GC/MS
data and as the program uses a NEXUS-like ﬁle as main
input, the addition of diﬀerent sources of data is quite
straightfoward. Also, based on user input it is possi-
ble to include new features with ease. GASP is also
automatically linked to the statistical package R, using
all the calculation power to generate statistics based on
peak alignment.
The software is available free of charge (to academics)
at
http://evol.mcmaster.ca/paulo/gasp.php Two ver-
sions are available, Windows and Linux. A chm help ﬁle
is available also, and it covers basic program usage and
some analysis features. Please feel free to download and
test it and send us your comments and opinions about
it.

Software Treeﬁnder
Here is the new world’s fastest maximum likelihood
phylogeny program on a PC:
www.treeﬁnder.de TREEFINDER has a new tree
search algorithm. In my simulations, the new
TREEFINDER is three times faster than PHYML,
which is the second fastest program. The results are
in the manual.
Tree calibration has been extended. Now,
TREEFINDER supports multiple calibration points
and time intervals. One can specify time boundaries
for tips as well as for internal nodes in a tree. I have
invented and added two new ﬂavours of rate smoothing
to overcome some problems with Sanderson’s NPRS:
The Global Rate Minimum Deformation method
(GRMD), and the Local Rate Minimum Deformation
method (LRMD).
I have also improved the utility to check for composi-
tional equilibrium in a sequence alignment. In addition
to computing p-values for individual sequences, the tool
now visualizes the distribution of base frequencies over
sites as well as over species.
Maximum likelihood optimization under the molecu-
lar clock is no longer supported. In my opinion, the
underlying assumtion of a constant rate is unrealistic
and not really worth the huge eﬀort on the algorith-
mic side. For calibration purposes, rate smoothing can
achieve the same much easier and has the merit of dis-
tinguishing clearly between the time scale and the dis-
tance scale. Moreover, one can incorporate explicit as-December 1, 2004 EvolDir 41
sumptions about the rate evolution into the objective
function. If you feel that my opinion is wrong, you may
try convincing me to re-implement the clock constraint
in a future release.
As usual, the program is available for Windows, Linux,
MacOS X and Solaris.
Did you know that a German scientist earns less than a
worker in car industry, but has studied for years? Ob-
viously, cars are much more useful than most of science.
Please note, that I am currently not being paid for my
work. I am looking for a position in Munich, where I
can continue the TREEFINDER project.

Software TuneClustalX
The previous post had an incorrect email. It is cor-
rected below.
TuneClustalX: A program that facilitates improving
the quality of multiple sequene alignments constructed
with ClustalX The quality of a phylogeny is no bet-
ter than the quality of the underlying data. In the
case of phylogenies based upon molecular sequenecs
the underlying data are in the form of a multiple se-
quence alignment, and the currently most popular tool
for multiple sequence alignments is ClustalX, a graph-
ical user interface version of the venerable ClustalW.
The most critical factor that aﬀects the quality of the
alignment is the proper choice of gap penalties, but
most users tend to use the default penalties because
it is both diﬃcult and frustrating to attempt to im-
prove the quality of an alignment by modiﬁcation of
those penalties. ClustalX provides a variety of tools
for modifying gap penalties and for identifying poorly
aligned regions, but it is diﬃcult to evaluate the con-
sequences of changing gap penalties. TuneClustalX
uses data that can be output from ClustalX to cal-
culate an average Quality Score. By modifying gap
penalties, then using TuneClustalX to calculate the
average Quality Score the user can quickly determine
whether the modiﬁcation improves the quality, makes
the quality worse, or has no eﬀect upon the quality of
the alignment. As a result, the user can begin with
the default gap penalties and quickly move toward gap
penalties that are optimized for the particular data set.
A Bellingham Research Institute report that describesand discusses TuneClustalX can be downloaded from:
www.bellinghamresearchinstitute.com by going to that
site, clicking the BRI Reports button, and choosing Re-
port #1.. That report also describes how TuneClustalX
was used to determine improved default gap penal-
ties for protein sequence alignments. TuneClustalX for
Macintosh, Windows, and Unix platforms is freeware
and, together with documentation, can be downloaded
from www.bellinghamresearchinstitute.com by clicking
the Software navigation button and choosing the ap-
propriate package for your platform.

Speciation with nonsister taxa
I am wondering if anyone has insight into this: what (if
anything) can we learn about speciation by studying
reproductive isolation between nonsister taxa? I was
told recently that you can’t learn anything about spe-
ciation by studying nonsister taxa, and I am interested
in other people’s feedback on this.
People have studied hybrid zones as centers to under-
stand speciation for decades and they are certainly not
always sister taxa, right?
If most species formed in allopatry anyway, the mech-
anisms that isolate two species probably arose more by
chance, and it is only when species come back together
in sympatry that these forces operate. How many times
do sister species themselves split and rejoin, as opposed
to a species reconnecting (secondary contact) with a
nonsister species? I would almost venture to say that
much of reinforcement occurs between nonsister taxa
(outside of zones where parapatric speciation is occur-
ring). Has anyone ever systematically looked at this?
And how much is known about the biogeography of the
distribution of current taxa? If two nonsister species are
broadly sympatric, and the sister taxa is in an isolated
pocket, then isn’t there reason to suspect that these two
closely related but nonsister taxa could have inﬂuenced
one another’s isolating mechanisms more than a sister
taxa? These two species I’m thinking of have distinct
segregated breeding habitats.
Particularly if hybridization is still occurring between
these species separated by many or few speciation
“events” then we can learn about why speciation has
not come to ’completion’, at least according to the bi-
ological species concept? So it may be more diﬃcult
to pinpoint the exact causes in non-incipient or nonsis-
ter taxa, but should we restrict all studies of speciation
to incipient and/or sister species? Piecing together the
puzzle may be more diﬃcult in nonsister taxa but it can
still be done, or evidence can be accumulated through
experimentation and observation. no?

adaptation in Moraba
Dear Evoldir reader, For a course dealing with adap-
tation I am planning to speak about adaptative land-
scape, and to illustrate the course with the historical
example of Moraba Scurra example of Lewontin and

chromosome inversion and the ﬁtness ? Is it known ?
Second does some more recent studies about the same

r8s error
Dear EvolDir members,
I have some queries regarding Penalized Likelihood
(PL) using the program r8s and would greatly appreci-
ate your feedback:
1) While running cross validation I got the following
message several times: MinND returned failure in Con-
strOpt on initial search (may restart!).
I assume it has something to do with the branch length,
but since my trees neither contain zero length branches
nor polytomies I don’t know what is going on.
2) Sometimes, while running cross validation for some
smoothing parameters I got a message: “smooth
smooth Sq Error Chi Square Error” with all the val-
ues and either a (Good) or (Failed) at the end of it.
Do I have to worry, when some smoothing parameters
failed?
3) In one data sets I observed that the cross valida-
tion scores were decreasing gradually under smoothing
parameters ranging from 1 to a 1000. Which cross-
validation score should be used in this case when cross
validation does not really ﬁnd “a lowest cross-validation
score”? Would 1 be ok?December 1, 2004 EvolDir 45

I am searching for a post-doctoral candidate who
has very strong statistical and mathematical skills-
preferably with a background in coalescent theory and
population genetic simulations-and is interested in ap-
plying these skills to search for genes causing common
human disease and for evidence of historical natural se-
lection in the human genome.
This position will require a great deal of creativity. The
ﬁrst project will most likely involve formalization of the
test for recent positive selection presented in “Sabeti,
Reich et al. (2002) Detecting recent positive selection
in the human genome from haplotype structure. Nature
419, 832-7.”
Subsequent projects may involve further studies of nat-

Postdoc: Human population genetics in Paris
A 2-year postdoctoral fellowship is available in Human
population genetics at the “Mus´ ee de l’Homme” (Mu-
seum of Mankind) in Paris (France.) The main objec-
tive is to study the impact of history and social orga-
nization on the distribution of genetic diversity in Cen-
tral Asia (Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, etc.)
This is part of an on-going research project that aims at
inferring the past demographic history of these popu-48 EvolDir December 1, 2004
lations, and understanding the relative role of social
organization, linguistic diﬀerences, recent migrations
and past population settlements in shaping the genetic
diversity in this area. We are particularly interested
in comparing populations with a past nomadic history
with populations of settled agriculturalists.
About 500 individuals from nine diﬀerent populations
have already been sampled and sequenced for the
mtDNA hypervariable region I. Most of these have also
been typed at 11 microsatellites located on the Y chro-
mosome. In order to complete the project, the postdoc
will focus on autosomal microsatellite markers.
The successful applicant should have a Ph.D. in popu-
lation genetics, and have experience in molecular biol-
ogy, including standard DNA techniques (DNA extrac-
tion, PCR, genotyping, etc.) Ideally, also, he or she
would assist with data analysis and address, via ana-
lytical methods and/or simulations, the reconstruction
of past demography that can explain the level and the
distribution of genetic diversity observed in this area.
The position is funded by the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientiﬁque (CNRS), but French citizens
ARE NOT eligible: Only non-French can apply. Gross
salary is 2150/month for a PhD that has just grad-
uated and increases with years of experience. Appli-

invertebrate larvae.
The proposed work aims at developing a method of in
situ hybridization on the whole larva, focusing on mol-
luscan larvae, to be applied to identify major species
from plankton samples collected in European coastal
waters. It will include sequencing, sequence analyses to
select putatively diagnostic sequences, and the design
of oligonucleotide probes. Designed probes will also be
tested to be used in phylogenetic chips, in collaboration
with BAS.
The successful candidate is expected to hold a PhD or
equivalent in biology or ecology. Relevant experience in
molecular biology approaches is required. Especially,
experience in in situ hybridization techniques will be
appreciated but not necessary. Background in marine
ecology will be advantageous.

to ﬁve years to reach market size. This is an obsta-
cle in the proﬁtable farming and global competitive-
ness of this species. In order to increase the produc-
tivity and the proﬁtability of the commercial activity,
a research program has been designed that makes use
of the modern technology currently applied to other
aquaculture species. The research program consists of
four main tears: a) induction of triploidy, b) establish-
ment of breeding programs with the assistance of ge-
netic markers, c) generation of linkage maps and QTL
identiﬁcation, d) and the application of gene transfer
technology.
The successful candidate will be primarily responsible
for establishing gene transfer technology in the per-
lemoen, Haliotis midae. This is an extremely exciting
new project that will establish a biotechnology platform
for abalone in southern Africa. Furthermore, this will
be the ﬁrst biotechnology application of a species used
for commercial application in Africa.
The position is available for 2 years

Postdoctoral Fellowship in Evolutionary Genetics Fixed
Term for 3 years School of Biological Sciences Vacancy
number: BS11711/1204A Closing Date: 1 December
2004
We are currently seeking a postdoctoral fellow with in-
terests in genetics, genomics, and evolution to conduct
research on mitochondrial DNA inheritance. Positions
are available immediately for a period of 3 years.
Project Description Current dogma holds that mito-
chondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited, in aclonal form, without recombination. This is clearly un-
true, but the frequency and evolutionary signiﬁcance of
paternal inheritance, heteroplasmy and recombination
of mtDNA remain to be determined. We propose to
look for evidence of paternal inheritance, heteroplasmy
and recombination of mtDNA in a hatchery popula-
tion of New Zealand chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
tshawytscha) in order to determine how great an in-
ﬂuence these phenomena have on population and evo-
lutionary interpretations of mtDNA data.
The Ideal Candidate The ideal candidate will possess
experience in both molecular genetics and population
genetics. You will be motivated and organised, with a
demonstrated capacity to master the broad skill set nec-
essary for the successful completion of a research pro-
gram that will span molecular genetics, bioinformatics
and biomathematics. You will be a competent labora-
tory worker, with experience of all routine molecular
genetic techniques, particularly genotyping, sequencing
and real-time PCR analyses. You should also be com-
puter literate with experience in database management,
statistical and population genetic analyses. Most im-
portantly, you will have a desire to forge a career in
research science, as witnessed by a track record of pub-
lication commensurate with your experience.
The successful applicant will join a thriving Molecular
Ecology Group, which uses advanced molecular genetic
technologies to elucidate complex ecological and evo-
lutionary problems in organisms ranging from marine
invertebrates to marine mammals. The group is well
equipped with dedicated sequencing facilities, PCR,
microbiology and genomic facilities etc. For more in-
formation on the Molecular Ecology Laboratory and
the School of Biological Sciences see the web page
www.biol.canterbury.ac.nz . Minimum qualiﬁcations:
PhD in Genetics, Molecular Biology, Genomics, Bioin-
formatics or equivalent.
Remuneration: NZ$52,000 per annum
Interested applicants are encouraged to make informal
enquires to Dr. Neil Gemmell, in the ﬁrst instance.
All application materials should be sent to the Human
Resources Administrator, College of Science, University
of Canterbury, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New
Zealand, Email: hr@science.canterbury.ac.nz Applica-

Post doc position in Department of Biology, University
of Oulu
“Reproductive biology of monogenean ﬂatworm para-
site Gyrodactylus salaris on susceptible and tolerant
salmon host populations”
We have characterized Gyrodactylus salaris as a na-
tive and rather harmless parasite in some populations
of Salmo salar (Lake Onega, the Baltic Sea), while it is
highly pathogenic in some other populations (Norway,
the White Sea). The ﬁeld observations indicate that the
tolerant salmon host transmits strong negative interfer-
ence between parasite clones. Mitochondrial DNA has
been used as a marker of the clones, but the conclu-
sions need conﬁrmation by nuclear DNA. The details
of the reproductive biology of the parasite are not well
understood, and comparative studies with other Gyro-
dactylus species will be supported & encouraged.The taska of the post doc will be
1) to develop nuclear DNA markers for Gyrodactylus, in
particular G. salaris, 2) to study the clonal structure of
parasites among tolerant and susceptible host popula-
tions, and 3) to describe the reproductive biology of the
parasite, with emphasis of population genetic and evo-
lutionary consequences 4) to collaborate with the team
members who try to characterize properties of tolerant
and susceptible salmon.
Recent publications from this project are visible or
available on our web site
http://cc.oulu.ﬁ/ ˜ jlumme/ These include papers in
Evolution, Int. J. Parasitol., Systematic Parasitology
and Parasitology. We have a good background in gen-
eral phylogeography of North-Eastern Europe.
>From the list of publications you can see that we work
in intensive collaboration with Professor Craig Primmer
(University of Turku) and with Russian colleagues, thus
having access to numerous salmon populations, both
susceptible and tolerant.
The environment in University of Oulu is supportive
for research in population genetics and evolution. Pro-
fessor Pekka Pamilo and Professor Outi Savolainen run
a national top unit of population genetics.
The position in question is granted from Finnish
Academy, and it is planned for a period of two years,
starting as soon as possible in 2005.

WageningenU ExperimentalEvol
Postdoc position in experimental evolution at Wagenin-
gen University
An innovative research incentives grant from the
Dutch Organisation for Scientiﬁc Research (NWO) was
awarded to study the role of antimicrobial compounds
and spatial structure in biodiversity. Using popula-
tions of bacteria and other microbes that adapt to sim-
ple laboratory environments, the process of adaptation
has almost exclusively been studied in environments
without structure, such as well-mixed batch cultures.
However, in nature unstructured environments are rare.
Spatially-structured environments also have fundamen-
tally diﬀerent consequences for adaptation, including
the fragmentation of the population into small subpop-
ulations, local interactions with competitors, and slower
population dynamics. Recent models have shown that
these consequences may be particularly relevant for
adaptation by interference competition, e.g. through
the production of antimicrobial compounds. The post-
doc will address these and other speciﬁc consequences
of spatial structure for adaptation using evolution ex-
periments with bacteria and fungi.
Proﬁle: We seek someone with a PhD in evolution-ary biology, microbial ecology or microbial genetics,
and experience with basic microbiological and molecu-
lar lab techniques and ecological and evolutionary the-
ory. Modeling skills (e.g. cellular automata) are an
advantage. Max. salary 3453 per month before tax.
Applications: Submit enquiries or applications (includ-
ing CV, letter of motivation and names and contact
info of two references) before November 19 to Arjan de
Visser, arjan.devisser@wur.nl. Wageningen University
is a small modern and well-equipped university in the
center of the Netherlands, whose research output was
top-ranked in a recent survey of Dutch universities. The
Department of Genetics was ranked 4.5 (scale 0-5) in
another recent international evaluation.

POSTDOCTORAL POSITION AT WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS
Postdoctoral positions are open to conduct research in
the evolution of regulatory networks in enteric bacteria.
Our laboratory has been examining the mechanisms
by which two-component regulatory systems respond
to environmental cues to modify the gene expression
patterns of bacterial species. The goals of the project
are: (1) to explore the contribution that diﬀerences in
gene regulation makes to phenotypic diﬀerences among
closely-related bacterial species; (2) to investigate the
genetic origins of regulatory interactions; (3) to study
how horizontally-acquired genes become regulated by
ancestral regulatory proteins; and (4) to determine the
ecological consequences of diﬀerent regulatory schemes.
These projects will entail the use of a multidisciplinary
approach that combines bioinformatics with molecular
genetics and microbiology.
Applications should include a curriculum vitae, the
names and contact information for three references,
and a brief statement of research interests and goals.
Applications should be sent to: Eduardo A. Grois-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct categoryDecember 1, 2004 EvolDir 59
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
